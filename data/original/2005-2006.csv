4,"As a final year med student about to be a neurosurgery intern in two months, I have spent several years in hospitals and several months as a subintern at major hospitals throughout the country. This is one of the most unrealistic medical shows I have ever seen. I'm sure it's fine as a drama or soap opera but don't expect any accurate depiction of what things are really like in surgery. Nobody expects an intern to operate solo. Getting a Chinese interpreter takes 5 minutes. Even a junior med student knows that. Interns and residents are not nearly as dumb as they are portrayed here. The job of the intern is to do scut work. It's really not that hard. You're just a glorified secretary for your superiors. You don't save lives. You don't dole out bad news to family. You don't really even scrub into cases that much. Cut-throat competitiveness is the exception among interns. Camaraderie is the norm. Also, for God's sake nobody touches their mask with bloody gloves. You don't take off your mask in the OR to talk. I could go on and on. It would be nice if Hollywood would hire even a med student as a consultant and pay them a nominal wage to get a little shred of realism.",2008
8,"Grey's Anatomy is a surprisingly addictive show. The plot lines are an interesting blend of soap opera, drama, and comedy--it's not really like anything else, but at the same time, it occasionally feels pedestrian. However, it's very well done--good writing, great acting, and well directed. ",2006
1,"This show is very slow and the narration is a little annoying, the characters aren't very interesting and it seems to always be based on the relationships. The whole 'choosing' gets really irritating....This is supposed to show how surgeons operate in the work place but seems to be a rip of an 'teenn soap'/ER.... ",2008
10,"This television series is one of the best dramas I've ever seen in a while. The cast has great chemistry, especially Patrick Dempsy and Ellen Pompeo. The script is flawless, full of new obstacles for each character to go through per episode, with bits of comedic writing in it as well. I have compared this series with the ER series and personally, I like this series much better. Grey's Anatomy has bits of life lessons for viewers to learn every so often. Many episodes breaks your hearts, making you feel tempted to even yell or shout at the television screen! Great cliff-hangers, making viewers waiting impatiently until next Thursday to see what happens next! Overall, Grey's Anatomy is a wonderful show. Tune in!",2006
6,"My girlfriend insisted, and continued to insist that I watch Grey's. Eventually, I gave in, and loved it. The first two seasons are gold. That's where it ends however, as the third season was simply more of the same. That should be good, right? It isn't. Some of the characters who previously annoyed me a little (notably the protagonist Merideth) have all of a sudden become so unable to establish (and maintain) a proper relationship that their stupidity makes me want to do something bad. ",2008
8,"I love this show the first 4 seasons with the original cast were amazing I couldn't stop watching. When Isiah Washington and the other actor who played George left it slowed down a bit. Then it picked up around the 6-7 season. A song beneath a song was a beautiful episode, many hated it. I was a part of the fans who LOVED it! I cried, laughed and truly enjoyed watching the actors go past the element of just acting and showcase their musical talent. No they're NOT professional singers they're professional actors! So of course they're not going to give Adele a run for her money yet it was so nice to watch them, I enjoyed that episode so so much! Although I would've loved to have heard Sandra Oh sing as she did in a prior episode when she sung Virgin by Madonna and she actually has a nice voice. ",2017
10,"I absolutely love this show! The characters are full of character and feeling and sense and everything that is in the best shows!!! The story lines are totally believable and there are sad parts, funny parts, intense moments, and refreshing insights...just everything I love in a great show. There are enough surprises to keep you guessing, but enough stability to keep me coming back to watch the next episode. This is truly an absolutely wonderful show! I cannot wait for the next season to begin and my daughter loves it too. All my co-workers love the show too and we watch it and look forward to discussing all the parts the next day at work! This show is irresitable...so if you haven't watched the first season...you should try to rent it or watch the re-runs (if they ever come on again!!!) We (my daughter and I) say - when is it coming back on?!? Now - tomorrow is too late :)",2005
1,"i'm writing this review after being a faithful fan for almost 6 years or probably more, the early seasons were awesome, then starting from the 7th Shanda rimes creativity started to turn into craziness, the 8th was a disappointment, all the stories were diluted and Shanda seemed indecisive whether to continue them or break them, the end of the 8th season was the most disturbing and stupid finale ever... the series seems to be written by an amateur, she crushed the spirit and the awesomeness of this series.....",2012
4,*Grey's SPOILERS* ,2006
1,"Was some time ago I watched this, but I remember being so very angry when I did. EVERYTHING ends happy! It's happier than all the cartoons, Disney movies or children's stories I have ever read!",2009
1,"Never in my life have I seen a worse show. The characters are shallow, have panic attacks literally ever 30 seconds, ignore actual patients and worry about each other, and the whole thing seems completely unrealistic. I wish Ellen Pompeo would stop with the George Bush impersonation and actually open her eyes. Just a terrible show. A better title would be ""girl doctors who complain about their sex lives and pretty much whore around the whole time"". If you want to see a near-perfect medical show, then hit up FOX on Tuesday nights to see a doctor at his finest: Hugh Laurie as Dr. Gregory House. Laurie's character, a pain-killer addicted M.D. with no regard for manners but a genius doctor, brings sheer brilliance to the screen, making the show unbelievably intense and suspenseful, yet manages to be completely realistic, and he ACTUALLY DEALS WITH HIS PATIENTS, rather than sleep with his co-workers. Grey's is just extremely sub-par, and fails to attract any demographic other than females who've had ""every kind of boyfriend."" In other words, ditch Grey's, watch House. Period.",2007
1,"I find it amazing to be in this minority but i feel this has come from the dumbing down of television. I can understand the need for a light hearted view of hospital life. However, this show from ABC heads in that direction with almost an identical rip off of Scrubs, with narrations, musical moments, and even some of the same jokes and situations.",2006
1,I absolutely can't believe that people would watch this.,2012
1,"Imagine a Medical show where you take out the wit of Scrubs, the excitement of E.R., and the drama of St. Elsewhere, and you'll start to get the feeling of what this show is all about. From the bland acting of Ellen Pompeo, to the pseudo-indie rock (Portions for Foxes by Rilo Kiley) that blares through every scene, this show is definitely aimed at the 18-35 year old demographic who happen to have penchants for over-acting and scripts filled with melodrama. I can't get over how everyone seems to be enthralled with a show that basically comes up with the worst catchphrases in the world, AND THEN RUNS WITH THEM. Why does America tune in every week for a show that makes The O.C. look like it was written by James Joyce. Mcdreamy? Mcsteamy? Mcgag me.",2007
10,"Nothing gets better than this. Leaving work early every Sunday night to see what's up with 9PM block on ABC in HAWAII. Love to be on that edge, wondering if she is going to have her McDreamy. It makes the suspense so intense! Grey and Shepard are a wonderful duo. The cast in the show are so awesome. Remembering Patrick Dempsey in ""Can't Buy Me Love"" and now a very mature individual who achieved so much to get where he's at now. Ellen Pompeo as a very fresh face in the Primetime Segment, and many other characters as well. As my four daughters would say, ""There must be more to life than Grey's Anatomy, Mom!"" I replied, ""I have you four girls first, but now it's my time...my time for McDreamy & Grey."" They all laughed and now leaves me alone for only one hour of laughter and tears.",2006
1,"With all the bitching and childish behavior that goes on in this show anyone would expect it to be set in college, not in a hospital. With a great name like Grays Anatomy, one would expect a high premise of medical situations, procedures and indeed, the feelings of the doctors and patients within the hospital. We get none of this. Instead we get a bunch of grown adults acting like children. This is ( and should be classified as) a soap opera, not a ""medical drama"" as the network would have us believe.",2007
1,"And that word is rubbish. If you want an engaging hospital show that shows it as it is, watch Scrubs. If you want a show which maybe is dramatised, but is at least entertaining, watch House. If you want a badly miscast show (only Sandra Oh looks like she might be a doctor: Ellen Pompeo looks at least 3 years OLDER than everyone else), with overdramatised turgid plot lines, all about how dreadful the life of the special person who becomes a surgeon is, watch this.",2006
3,"Sadly overacted, unrealistic, predictable series with 10 carbon copies of one character. The surgeons & residents all stammer, grow speechless, have the same tone, similar reactions, lines, mannerisms, tears streaming down their faces... and these are doctors in a hospital. Have the show's creators and writers ever been in a hospital? It's all unheard of.",2010
10,"I Claudius was maybe the best miniseries ever. Now, there's Rome, and it's even better. ",2005
9,"HBO does it again. I got my start with the network back in 1990 with a sitcom called Dream On. From there, I have followed the yellow brick road through Sex and the City, Sopranos, Six Feet Under, Band of Brothers, From the Earth to the Moon and Deadwood (not to mention hours and hours of boxing, documentary specials and tons of movies).",2005
10,"Having watched the first three episodes, I am anxiously looking forward to seeing the rest of the episodes. All of the intrigue that was Rome is presented well, considering that no one involved lived during that time that could give accurate details on Roman life. For that matter, all historical presentations that are over a hundred years old are filled in with speculation and assumption and for that no one can discredit the attempts at accuracy.",2005
9,"Created by Bruno Heller,Rome has become one of the greatest HBO mini series of all time and certainly one of the best about Rome.It's up there with the best of them and even(I never thought it was possible)gives I Claudius a run for it's money.",2010
10,"I saw the ROME Series, Both Season 1 & 2, in a weeks time.. And the last four episodes, in one go.. Such was my addiction to this splendid series that, I am still awestruck...",2012
10,"HBO's Rome two seasons (originally shown in the years 2005-2007) covers in twenty two episodes the twenty two year period between the battle of Alesia in 52 BC and the aftermath to the battle of Actium in 30 BC (Julius Caesar's assassination in 44 BC is shown at the end of the first season and the beginning of the second season). While several plot threads runs through the series, basically the first season is about how Caesar rose to hold absolute power (defeating rivals like Pompey) just before being murdered, while the second season tell us how after Caesar's death, a struggle began between Octavian (later emperor Augustus) and Mark Antony to fill the power void generated by Caesar's death.",2012
10,"Historical dramas,as a rule, are very hit and miss. While they can look stunning most will suffer from a lack of drama. And it will always be a challenge to bring to life the movers and shakers of history accurately. Just look and Troy and Alexander.While both were visually stunning they lacked depth(Alexander) and and historical accuracy(Troy).",2007
10,"I've become so bored of mainstream television over the last decade that I now make a point of only watching series that are history-related, given my huge love of the subject matter. I missed ROME when it was first shown, but heard so much good about it that I caved in and bought the box set on Blu-ray. I'm so glad I did; believe the hype, ROME is the ultimate in costume drama.",2011
10,"This Review includes Rome: the Complete Series Parts 1 & 2. I'll begin by crowning HBO ""King of the Mini-Series"". Any doubt, just look at Rasputin, Citizen X, John Adams, Band of Brothers, From Earth to the Moon, Grey Gardens and others. Rome the Series has it all, a literate script, a superb cast, fantastic production values, unbelievable special effects, makeup and stunt-work, brilliant directing by ALL directors involved, excellent pacing and a terrific music score throughout. It is pretty much historically accurate in events and history. Even Vorenus and Pullo were actually mentioned in Caesar's writings, the only non-aristocrats who were. The grittiness of Rome and its people stands out. The lascivious, decadent society is portrayed in all its lewdness. The violence of these people is oft times shocking and gross as well it should be. No candy-coating here! The politics and lifestyles of Rome are fascinatingly presented. Standouts in a perfect cast are: Kevin McKidd & Ray Stevenson as Vorenus & Pullo; James Purefoy aptly schizophrenic as Marc Antony; Ciaran Hinds properly regal as Julius Caesar; Polly Walker schemingly wicked as Atia; Max Pirkis & Simon Woods as the younger and older Octavian; Lyndsey Marshal voluptuous and cunning as Cleopatra and Kenneth Cranham wonderfully sympathetic as Pompey Magnus. I wish I could list them all. The only negative with Rome the Series is that it does not continue on thru Octavian (Augustus), Caligula, Claudius and the rest. I really didn't want this series to end.",2010
10,HBO and BBC's co produced Rome is an outstanding series. As an Ancient History graduate one would expect me to nitpick and well take it all way too seriously but thats simply not the case! As I have studies I really appreciate it more and love the way a favourite subject of mine has been brought to the screen.,2007
8,"I should point out that I've watched only the first season (episodes 1–12), which purports to chronicle the period of history between Caesar’s conquest of Gaul, and his eventual assassination.",2008
10,"This series almost defies belief with its masterful attention to cultural detail combined with a level of accuracy that is simply astonishing for popular series or movies. One could almost believe that someone laid hands on a time machine and took the whole crew back to 52 BC for filming. Clearly, no expense was spared in the making of this series, which has all the polish and flair of a big-budget movie, combined with an archeologist's critical eye for accuracy and detail. ",2006
10,"After the excreable ""Empire"", which I think might have killed this whole genre for the next 5 years, Rome arrived to save the day.",2005
10,"WHY was this series canceled?!!! While waiting for the new season of Game of Thrones to return, my husband and I started watching Rome on demand to stave off our epic genre addiction and we Love it! We were so disappointed to find out that it had been canceled! What a shame and only 2 seasons? Why? ",2014
6,"Before I review the film, let me start off by saying that I am a fan of the Harry Potter films and have liked all of them up to this point. I'm not going to compare the movie to the book because, as most people know, they are two completely different animals. There is no way in heaven, hell or on God's green Earth that a book the size of Goblet of Fire could appropriate EVERYTHING that happened in the novel. I'm going to go by what I saw up on the screen.",2005
3,"First, the good news -- The special effects and the music in the this movie were the best yet! The underwater scenes especially were very well done. ",2005
4,"I have to say, I'm really disappointed in how this film turned out, especially in comparison with how great the book is. In my humble opinion, studios have to face up to the fact that two and a half hours is no longer sufficient to capture the scope and power of J.K. Rowling's universe.",2005
1,"There are a lot of things wrong with this movie and the part that's really wrong are the characters. 1000 words aren't enough to explain everything so I'll have to be brief. The worst character is Dumbledore. What version of him Kloves & Newell see I have no idea.. I mean, have they read the books at all? Would Albus Dumbledore, one of the greatest wizards alive manhandle one of his own students, especially his favorite student? I should think not. Would he use Harry as bait to lure Voldemort out of hiding? Same answer as above, NO. Gambon can't play him to save his life, Richard Harris could, he had the twinkle in his eyes... something that makes Dumbledore so special. Gambon just comes off as a lunatic.",2005
8,It's unfortunate that so much of the book needed to be cut for time and the movie is still nearly 2 1/2 hours long. The rule of movie editing is when you must trim for time you remove the sub-plots. A lot of story and character development isn't there.,2005
1,"The movie ran as if it were a series of highlight clips from an actual film representation of the fourth harry potter novel. Details were thrown in haphazardly, if for no other reason than to bring a feeling of recognition from readers. If the viewer had not read the book, but only seen the previous two movies, s/he would not have understood the movie. The screenwriters created no semblance complicated plot, but rather the rather single-minded story of the three tasks in the tri-wizard tournament. All new characters were hardly introduced and remained quite one-dimensional, which is unfortunate; even old favorites got the shaft in this one. There was no time for more than two short scenes with either Malfoy, no magical lessons, and Dobby the house elf was completely absent. Crouch never disappeared, but his body was found dead. The cinematics in this case were atrocious: Harry appears in Dumbledore's chambers in the scene immediately after discovering Crouch's body, but then proceeds to tell him about his scar hurting and dreams rather than Crouch's discovery. There was no magical map, no late-night encounters with Moody, no discussion of Snape and Karkaroff's relationship, nor of Dumbledore trusting Snape. Seeing as this relationship will rise to be the single most prominent issue in the entire series, I was very disappointed to find it was ignored in favor of large and ineffective theatrics, such as a hedge maze without any traps, only shifting walls and evil roots, an extremely obnoxious modernized yule ball, and a pointlessly drawn out dragon chase scene. Dumbledore's lines and the directing of his acting made him look like an old, bumbling fool, rather than the clever, most-powerful-wizard on the planet, the only person of whom Voldemort is afraid. The writers decided to add Crouch Jr. into Harry's dreams, completely removed the second house-elf and the invisibility cloak from the quidditch world cup, and had the audacity to explain that Crouch Jr. had been sent to Azkaban, but never explained his escape. Finally, the movie ended with Crouch Jr. being sent back to Azkaban. The Minister of Magic never showed up with dementors to kill Crouch, Dumbledore never argued with him about the verity of Harry's claims, and the potential for an amazing cliff-hanger conclusion with Dumbledore in all his might giving orders to Hagrid and others as a general before the final battle, was instead replaced by a horrible attempt at a eulogy combining direct quotations from the novel with poor scriptwriting to make Dumbledore out to be a poor speaker as well as incompetent wizard. I shudder to think how the next movie will have to deal with all of these plot gaps, and how Dumbledore can hope to maintain any semblance of respectability when he trusts Snape and continues to avoid Harry in the fifth movie. Much better would have been to stick with the original idea and make two movies. This movie didn't feel like it had any plot, one did not become attached to the characters, and spent the movie groaning or laughing at the contrived immaturity of it all. Some acting by Harry and friends was good, but it was overshadowed by a terrible attempt to fit everything and nothing into the movie.",2005
4,"I have to say that I disagree with almost every review posted here. I traveled for an hour to see the movie at midnight, for the first showing. I am a huge Harry Potter fan and have been eagerly awaiting the release of this film. How disappointed I was. I must say that I think that the fourth book is perhaps the weakest in the series, but it is still a good read. The movie, however, was by far the worst yet. So many important details were left out, the movie raced along trying to fit as much plot into two and a half hours as possible. Of course there was excitement, funny moments,and talented acting. But overall, the plot moved so quickly, that one barely felt any connection to the characters involved other than what has been built up from the last three movies and the book. The Yule Ball was ridiculous, and Hermione (Emma Watson) was overly dramatic. The challenges in the Tri-Wizard Tournament were rushed through and the other competitors characters were not built up. You barely know, yet alone feel anything about Viktor Krum, Fleur, or even Cedric Diggory. The special effects were great, but could not make up for the loss of the ""magic"" felt in the books and other movies. The final scene with Voldemort was well-done. Scary, suspenseful, exciting. But I must say I will not be seeing this movie again in the theaters as I have the last three.",2005
6,"Based on one of the best books of the Harry Potter series, the film adaptation of 'Harry Potter and the Goblet' had a lot to live up to and I think it succeeded. As Potter fans will know, in GoF, Harry is now fourteen and in his Fourth Year at Hogwarts. When an ancient tournament between Hogwarts and two other European wizarding schools is held that year, a Seventh Year contestant is chosen from each school to compete but things go dramatically awry when Harry, three years too young to even be entered in the dangerous and challenging tournament, is somehow also chosen after his name is mysteriously nominated. GoF is a sharp turning point in the books as the tone darkens considerably and the characters themselves change from being rather wide-eyed innocent children to adolescents thrust the turbulent, uncertain adult world where being 'good' or even an innocent will not guarantee your survival. This shift is also reflected in the film, which was rated 12A (PG13 for Americans), the first of the HP films to be rated so high.",2005
1,"A fabulous film -- if you haven't read the books. Really exciting, and nothing left out -- if you haven't read the books. However, if you have read the books, it is a complete and utter disappointment. I went into the theater thinking, 'This shouldn't be too bad,' but, after seeing what they did to Mad-Eye Moody (i.e. the HUGE BLACK STRAP) I wasn't all that thrilled. Dumbledore - completely out of character. During one scene, he actually shakes Harry and yells in others. The Albus Dumbledore of the books is a wise, calm old man, not a raging but clueless crackpot. Many things are left unexplained; such as Neville's fear of the Cruciatus (sp?) curse, and what exactly happens to Barty Crouch (senior). Of course, if you have read the book, you know exactly what is going on, but as an innocent movie-goer who has never even glanced in the books, you are left wondering. And as Emma Watson already being quite pretty, the supposed transformation when she appears at the Yule Ball is muted and almost nonexistent; it simply that she put her hair up. All house-elves are not mentioned at all. S.P.E.W. is gone (though, despite it being a interesting subject in the book, it wasn't particularly important to the story). And it is Neville who gives Harry the gillyweed, instead of Dobby. Of course, that still works quite well, as Neville is so good at Herbology. But, did anyone think that Voldemort was far too jolly? Or is that just me? 'Oh, Harry, I'd almost forgotten you were there!' Can you honestly picture that coming from the great Dark Lord's mouth? There were many other examples during that scene; it was extremely annoying. As for the Dark Mark appearing in the sky, it comes too late. The tents are set on fire (where are the people suspended in the sky?) and everyone is running. Yes, that's reason to be scared, but surely the Dark Mark appearing is far better. So, after everyone has left, who should come along but Barty Crouch Jr. Then he fires the Dark Mark into the sky, and the producer thinks, 'Oh, good. We've got that in the story; people shouldn't complain.' Nope; wrong. He fires it a bit too late. After EVERYONE has left he brings out what should have started the terror. How stupid. (And it was also disappointing when they only made one comment that might suggest who won the World Cup. I'm Irish; I would have been very pleased if they had made that a bit more apparent. While we're on the subject of Barty Crouch Jr., I will bring up that his character totally changed. Instead of being this sniveling, scared young man who calls out to his father in desperation only to have Barty (senior) say, ""You're no son of mine,"" we have him as a weird, explosive monster who comes up and licks his lips at his dad and is all, ""Nyehehehe. Hello, Father."" The 'son of mine' line only works if you make Barty (Jr.) a proper, terrified, misunderstood boy. And Sirius. Gary Oldman makes no actual appearance; how do we even know that it was him who was talking to Harry? And that was done horribly. Instead of Sirius's head appearing in the flames, we have a grotesque thing (that did not look anything like Sirius) popping out of the embers. And also, when Harry sends off his letter to Sirius at the beginning, it is clearly marked on the front to go to Sirius Black. But how ridiculous! His letter could have been intercepted, and then everyone would know that Sirius was somewhere nearby, and that someone (if they weren't one of the people who knew either Harry's handwriting or Harry's owl) was in contact with him. But, as for the acting and the special effects, it was all fine.",2005
7,"As a fan of the potter book series, I'm going to start with my opinion of the movie,and then I'm going to slaughter the adaption.",2005
1,"This is the worst conversion of book to screenplay in the whole series. From the first scene where there are characters in the movie scene that are not in the book scene, to added scenes in the storyline, to radically changed scenes in the triwizard trials, this screenplay bares only a passing resemblance to the book. The book was fine, and had plenty of drama and excitement at the needed times. there was no need to rewrite the story, only trim it down for runtime.",2005
1,"It was toooooo rushed. The length of this book should have been matched with a movie the caliber of the lord of the rings movies. It was too unfaithful to the books and left out many characters or made them too small. Rita Skeeter was barely in it, you didn't feel the evil that should have emanated from her. Plus, nothing happened to her at the end. If these movies are to be the standard for Harry Potter movies to come, true fans should be disgusted. Dobby, Winky, Ludo Bagman, Hogwarts classes in general, other students, the Dursleys, Ton-Tongue toffees, all gone. Shunted to the side was the whole graveyard scene, Voldemort wasn't scary at all, Dumbledore was almost violent to Harry. Overall, there wasn't enough time in the film to give the characters their due limelight. With Rita Skeeter not caught, no Winky, Sirius almost non-existent, the next movie will probably sink as low as this one and its predecessors. If these books are so long, the movies should be made longer.",2005
1,"At the time this film came out, I was convinced that it indicated that the longer the Harry Potter book, the worse the film. Now, with Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix out, I am relieved that this isn't the case -- instead, I now fully comprehend how thoroughly bad this picture is.",2007
7,"What summed this film up for me was the comments of my non-HP book reader wife and friend. ""Didn't really understand it"".",2005
9,"Mike Newell is forgiven for cutting out so much detail from the book, and JK Rowling is forgiven for writing wonderfully rich books. However, fans of the book cannot help but feel like riding a roller coaster that is so fast there is no time to enjoy the ride. I predict the huge void between book and movie will spur remakes in about 10 to 20 years. Even if the movies must be 5 hours long, Harry Potter fans are willing to sit through them. This movie doesn't get a 10 because it leaves me feeling like something is missing, but it does deserve a 9 for being the best possible portrayal of the book given a 2.5 hour limitation. All said and done, this is the shortest 2.5 hour movie I have ever watched.",2005
1,"If you read the book the movie sucks. What happened to the whole Rita Skeeter scandal? What happened to the Hogsmeade trips and visiting Sirius? What happened to the Weasley's coming to watch Harry and Fluer meeting Bill? What happened to the tournament winnings that Harry gave to Fred and George? What happened to Dumbledore explaining the fact that Harry and Voldemort's wands had the same core, and that the feather came from Fawkes? Why didn't they play out Ron and Harry's fight better? What happened to Viktor talking to Harry about his feelings for Hermione? Where was Dobby? Why didn't Harry see Barty Crouch Jr. sneaking into Snape's storage? Why didn't Harry ask about Neville's parents? Didn't Belatrix Lestrange torture Neville's parents?",2005
1,"first off this was a sloppy fast tracked Hollywood (get it out for the holidays) project . if you read the book or listened to the audio book you would know what i mean. right from the beginning it is wrong no tavern scene , harry wakes up at at ron's house from the dream ? no durdleys no fireplace pickup to take harry to the world cup . no house elfs liberation front no actual showing of serious black . i understand that to make this book a movie it would have to be 5 hours long but honestly the dragon scene is nothing like the book you never see anyone but harry fight a dragon. Harry's dragon scene was added to not like the book the dragon does not land on a roof or chase harry through the country side ... I hope when you see this movie you buy the book and read it cover to cover i guarantee you a much better experience . of all the books and movies this one leaves the most out . and to see dumbledoor running around like a nervous idiot is just wrong . trust me if you are a true fan you will be extremely disappointed like i am . get peter jackson to do the rest of the movies (someone with attention to detail )",2005
5,"I went to see this movie this afternoon and to be honest i was expecting disappointment as happened with the other three potter movies but i wasn't quite expecting what i saw. I am a lover of the books and have read them all many (10+) times (ex HBP) and hate it when important bits of the plot are cut. I think in terms of effects and general film making the film was good, the acting from the majority of the cast was also excellent, however i feel that the movie moved too fast and didn't really explain what was going on. If you've seen the trailer you have pretty much seen the movie. Much of the Plot involving Rita skeeter was cut (i think we only saw her twice) which i find very disappointing as it sets up the fifth book and the ""harry is crazy, look at what was said about him in the prophet last year"" plot. One surprise for me though was Mad-eye-moody, after seeing the trailers and photos i was dreading him being played as a joke character with his mad eye but i was very impressed with his character and performance although i did notice the lack of CONSTANT VILIGANCE. Overall i think this movie could be used as a 'look what i can do with my computer' movie.

1,"this movie was horrible. all that you get from it is a very basic plot outline. there are huge time gaps, changes in scenes, and total disregard for what happens in the book. all of the subtle nuances that make the harry potter series great are missing from this movie. some scenes are completely changed from the book. the horntail scene, world cup scene, and many many others are completely redone. this being said, there were some impressive CGI effects done. the world cup stadium, though they do not seat harry and his friends in the correct place, and do not show the match its self (which was personally very disappointing, because i had been looking forward to seeing the match quite a lot) is, as a CGI work alone, very impressive, as is the maze at the end. despite these minor interesting details, the majority of the movie is very poorly done in relation to the book. accordingly, this is easily the worst of the four movies released to date.",2005
6,"-=-=-=-SUMMARY: The movie leaves a lot to be desired. It nails its dark ending, but the rest of the film is disjointed and without substance. Why? It puts a little of everything in, rather than a lot of a few things. ""Star"" characters Krum, Fleur, Cedric, and Cho get the shaft in a big way -- but at least it looks pretty?-=-=-=-",2005
7,"First of all, I must mention that Goblet of Fire is my favourite Harry Potter book, and so I expected great things from this movie. And great things I did get, but they were entirely unexpected.",2005
1,"TO be honest, this was my favourite book of all of them so far and frankly i was shocked at how terrible it really was. For gods sake will you choose a SUITBALE Dumbledore?? Its really depressing to see a wannabee actor playing the great wizard. All the good parts were missing from the book!! We didn't see David Tennant have his soul sucked which was rubbish, for goodness sake, get it together with amateur acting man!! I wasted my money and I certainly won't be buying this twaddle on DVD. I hope they pick it up for the next one as I immensely enjoyed ""The Order Of The Phoneix"" and its structure. I advise anyone with a likeness to the book, PLEASE Don't SEE IT!!!!",2005
7,"This just goes to show that these films are merely based!!! on the brilliant series that is the Harry Potter books. Again Fair play to the actors, they have matured and acted better than ever in this film and i thoroughly enjoyed Rupert Grints portrayal of Ron, for me it was him who somehow kept me in the cinema and reminded me of some of the brilliant scenes in the book. The first problem with this film is that almost the whole film is dark and disturbing, like the last half hour of the prisoner of Azkaban. there are hardly any light fun moments, any that were, were cut from the film. for example, Dudley's huge tongue after eating Fred and George's sweet prototypes for their future joke shop.",2005

All hail to Mike Newell, the director of this masterpiece!

10,"It sickened me in the past to see the Batman movie franchise slowly digging it's way to an early grave. After the quality Tim Burton films, the series pretty much went down the toilet, beginning a horrifically campy age of 'Bat credit-cards' and an armored Arnold Schwarzenegger tossing cringe-worthy puns at a Batman who seemed to be trying not to be embarrassed by the fact that his costume had nipples. So what could Warner Brothers producers hope to do to resurrect the franchise? Pretend it never happened, and start the whole series over again with a talented director, compelling story and capable cast. ",2005
10,"Christopher Nolan (and cast) have pulled off what I hadn't dared to dream - a Batman every bit as good as Burton/Keaton's vision - and eradicated the camp, feverish memories of Clooney, Kilmer and (cough..) O'Donnell.",2005
10,"I had fearful reservations about this one. I loved Tim Burton's Batman - 12 years old when it came out I was the perfect age for it and I also enjoyed Batman Returns. The franchise went so wrong under Joel Schumacher that I wasn't sure I wanted it resurrected. Not least because Batman was one of the few comics I read and enjoyed as a kid and was always my favourite superhero. I grew up reading the comics, watching reruns of the Adam West TV show and then getting Burton's celluloid vision. I was spoilt for choice as a kid but as an adult now I was concerned revisiting the franchise, especially given Warner's record over the last decade of screwing up summer blockbusters with potential all over the place (dare I bring up the Matrix sequels?)",2005
8,"Finally, after the previous 2 outings of the caped crusader, the Batman franchise is back on track. Having been a big comic collector over the years and a long time fan of the Dark Knight, I was especially disappointed by 'Forever' and 'Batman and Robin'. To me, these film lost the essence of what drives Bruce Wayne to do what he does and turned Batman into more of a pop star than misunderstood hero.",2005
10,"I got a chance to see 'Batman Begins' just this past Friday evening. I must say that before seeing the film, I felt in my heart this is the 'Batman' film we've been waiting for. Within ten minutes into the movie, I turned to my date and said to her, ""This is it! This is the movie!"" I just can't believe that after all these years, Warner Bros. finally got it right. For me the most intriguing part of the film, apart from the great script, and great acting, was Christopher Nolan's decision to base the film in reality. Deciding that Batman could really exist in our universe and our world was a stroke of genius. Another aspect of the film that's so refreshing is that instead of the focus being on the villain, Batman is the film's star. And rightly so. It's amazing what can happen when a studio leaves a respected director, and the creative team alone, and allow them to make the best movie possible. The only two negatives that I can think of is Katie Holmes and the fight sequences. Holmes does indeed look like a teenager playing grown-up. Her performance isn't bad per SE, it's just that you really don't buy her as an Assistant D.A. As for the fight sequences, I felt the cameras angles were too tight on the action, edited too quickly, and lit too dark so that you really couldn't tell what was going on and determine who was hitting who. Maybe we can attribute this to the fact that Nolan is not an action director. Hopefully the next film will open up the fight sequences so we can actually see Batman use the martial arts skills he developed during his exile. But apart from those relatively minor quibbles, the film is excellent, and I'm definitely going back on opening day June 15th, and seeing it a second time. A third and fourth viewing is definitely not out of the question.",2005
8,"I've just come back from a preview screening of Batman Begins. I went in with low expectations, despite the excellence of Christopher Nolan's previous efforts. Talk about having your expectations confounded! This film grips like wet rope from the start. I won't give away any of the story; suffice to say it mixes and matches its sources freely, tossing in a dash of Frank Miller, a bit of Alan Moore and a pinch of Bob Kane to great effect. ",2005
10,"This film easily trumps any live-action incarnation we've scene of the Dark Knight before, borrowing heavily from both the comics and the Dini and Co. animated series. This is a hard, fast, driving, heartfelt epic that draws you into the character of Bruce Wayne and makes you damn well care. Batman doesn't play second-fiddle to the villains here like in the other films. It's his movie and that's the way it should be.",2005
10,"I just came back from a special screening of Batman Begins and I must say this is the best movie I have yet seen this year. All of the blockbuster movies I had seen this year with much expectation have been disappointing. But Batman Begins is not the typical corny action film; it incorporates all aspects of genre: action, fantasy, drama, and even comedy. I was at the edge of my seat from the thrills in some scenes and clapping & laughing from the humorous lines that director Christopher Nolan had written for the characters. I was really amazed by the acting performances from the new generation of actors, assuming that they wouldn't have been able to compete with and compliment the talented, veteran actors such as Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, and Liam Neeson. I mean you couldn't have asked for better actors!! Christian Bale was just perfect for the role: he had the intensity, physique, and charm you'd expect a Batman character to encompass. Every actor was casted perfectly for their roles. I even give props to Katie Holmes for playing a district attorney considering her previous roles consisted of ""the young girl"" or ""girlfriend"". ",2005
8,"Batman Begins was a massive breath of fresh air when it came out in 2005. Coming 8 years after Warner Brothers jumped the bat, as it were, with Joel Schumacher's childish mess, ""Batman and Robin"", Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins brought a maturity and seriousness to The Caped Crusader that had been absent since Tim Burton left the world of Gotham. While Batman Begins might not boast the visual prowess or rich villains of Burton's two Batman movies, it fleshed out the character of Bruce Wayne in a way no movie has since.",2015
10,"BATMAN BEGINS lives up to what I heard about it being a ""darker"" version, with much less reliance on flippant one-liners or gags, the result being a more realistic feel for what might have been.",2005
10,"For those of you who were disappointed with the last few Batman movies, 'Batman Begins' redeems the caped crusader in a big way. 'Batman Begins' takes us on a journey through Bruce Wayne's tragic past again, giving us a real insight into what drives and fuels his quest against suffering and injustice. We discover how the billionaire came to be trained in the martial arts, develop his alter ego, and acquire his technological arsenal. Christian Bale gives us a riveting performance as not only a very dark hero, but also a tortured soul looking for the means to combat the wrongs of society, a society that we see is also responsible for the death of his beloved parents. Another thing we notice from the beginning is this story does not tie into that of the other movies in the series. This is however not a disappointing feature, in fact it seems to breathe new life into this timeless classic. So for all of us who have followed the Dark Knight's journey's, strap yourself in for a wild and inspiring ride.",2005
10,"Over the years the Gotham City that was once a dark place lined with evil and corruption, in desperate need of a hero, deteriorated into a circus tent of Hollywood displays with over-dramatic architecture and special effects... Where criminals dance around in blacklight sensitive face paint and so-called villains compete for best comedic performance. Behind all the bright lights and all-star celebrity casting, we lost grasp of what the saga is really about: Batman.",2005
10,"After an excellent film, a great film and two diabolical films, there is finally a brilliant Batman film. Tim Burton's Batman offerings were undeniably superb and eclipsed their follow ups in greatness, but even then there were severe weaknesses in the Batman franchise's transfer from page to the big screen. Burton didn't manage to fully shake Batman's unfortunate ""camp crusader"" persona that the Dark Knight picked up from the terrible 1960s TV series. Though considerably darker, the high camp, pop art undertones that were never intended in the Batman comics were still present in Burton's films. Then of course, ""Batman Forever"" and ""Batman and Robin"" took that to an incredibly unnecessary extreme. Batman was lost. Thank heavens for Christopher Nolan. Obviously as disillusioned with the failing franchise as most of the disgruntled comic book fans, Nolan has managed to not only restore the dark, Gothic ambiance of the comics, but also take Batman to new heights, and ""Batman Begins"" is far more than a comic book adaptation. For the first time in a Batman movie, Bruce Wayne's introduction and character foundation is so fascinating and emotionally charged, that you are not merely waiting for him to put the Bat suit on for the first time. Being the first chapter chronologically in the Batman saga, Wayne's character pre - bat is essential to the success of the narrative. His motive for wanting to fight injustice and his childhood traumas are told so beautifully that the movie would almost work well enough if the Batman alter ego never came into play. But, of course, when he does, Batman really begins. Christian Bale is quite simply the best Batman audiences have ever had the privilege of viewing. For the first time, Batman really is a symbol of fear, as was the comic's intention. This is all thanks to Bale's flawless performance as the dark Knight. Criminals and do-gooders alike fear Batman. But, frightening as he is, he is just another Superhero in terms of fear when it comes to Cillian Murphy's Scarecrow. With the genius use of hallucinogens to enhance the fear, Scarecrow might just be the most frightening antagonist since ""The Exorcist's"" demon. The point of view shots from his victims are a more effective alternative to his character than just giving him superpowers. That way, Nolan manages to hold onto the film's overall sense of reality and drama. The film's most effective aspect is the darkness. The stunning set piece creates a nightmarish world that is pure fear incarnate, and with fear being the film's driving force, the darkness is perfectly placed. All of the supporting actors, bar none, are without imperfections in this movie, particularly Katie Holmes, who proves that she is more than a tabloid friendly teen idol. Its just a great shame that her performance in ""Batman Begins"" was very much overshadowed by her bizarre relationship with Tom Cruise. Michael Caine is severely amiable as Alfred, and the eternally impressive Gary Oldman delivers yet another excellent performance. But of course, it is Bale who steals the show. Obviously relishing the role, Bale makes Batman a character we've never had the privilege of meeting before. More than a straight talking superhero armed with one liners. Batman, thanks to Bale, is now an emotionally unstable, fear inducing warrior. Batman Begins is free from superhero cliché and camp humour. It is, finally, a real Batman movie. The dreaded prison break scene is no less than amazing, and the subsequent parade of justice and optimism, combined with a considerate reference to a legendary Batman enemy, make this film perfect from start to finish.",2006
10,"All i can say is thank you Chris Nolan,,,I still think you will have to be a magician to beat Tim Burton's Batman film's but Nolan has is well on his way to becoming Houdini. This is a film that describe's Batman as he was in the comics and i think as Bob Kane imagined...So how has Nolan done it..Simple..i've seen the xtras on the Region 2 DVD and it appears that he didn't rush anything and really worked hard on this and recruited the best of the best in the movie making business,it's an extremely hard character to portray and a risky franchise as a director to do a good job as Joel Schumacher found out. He has had some good films like The Lost Boys etc but his take on the Batman was purely a joke and i think he had potentially ruined a huge money making franchise...But however it has been saved with Nolan's amazing take on Gotham and Christian Bale's Dark Knight which truly is an amazing likeness to the comics,,,This film has everything that we wanted and more because it has a beginning a middle and an amazing end which makes batfan's itching for more and a sequel which promises just that,,,it has an all star cast too,Morgan Freeman and doing an amazing job in succeeding the great Michael Gough's Alfred we have Michael Caine..The villain is the Scarecrow but in true Gotham Style there are more corrupt going's on in Gotham than good and who are they gonna call to clean it up..Simple.....THE BATMAN...This film has more gadget's and lifelike special effects than any other Batman Film so it's definitely one to watch..Thanks and i hope you enjoy it as much as i did..",2005
10,"At last it appears evident that Hollywood have listened and made the superhero more believable. Batman through Bale is an honest character easily related to his alter-ego. The enemy is normal (compared to the green goblin and nuclear man!), and the City although futuristic allows the audience a certain mystical sincerity. Bale is strong as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. The underpin to the story line depicting how Wayne became Batman is well written and acted. There is of cause the usual moral picture painted through Wayne and his childhood friend emphasizing that revenge is a negative motivation in cleaning up Gotham. Good kit and a great car... 2008 is marked up for the follow up with Bale in the lead role again, keep up the good work and we hope Superman is as REAL.",2005

Christian Bale did an amazing job with the tough role of being batman. i then saw this with my cousin who loved it as well. this is probably the best superhero movie I've ever seen. superman, horrible. batman, OK. spider-man the first one, OK. spider-man 2, boring. and so on. but this, this was amazing. it was well worth the 10 dollars to see it and i cant wait until it comes out on DVD. one of the best movies of the year and it deserves to be in the top 10.",2005
10,"The best film I have seen so far in 2005. It had everything, action and a little romance. but not enough to distract you from the main story line. Forget all the Batman films of the past and look to the future. Batman is back, bigger and better. The stunts are great, and add to the plot instead of being the hole story. And for once the supporting actors don't let you down. They actually boosted the story and helped to keep the plot moving in the right direction. Unlike those in the Btman films of the past. When Batman Begins comes out on DVD in October I will be buying the 2 disc set and I hope you will too. When the next Batman film hits the big screen I will be the first in line to see it, and being a woman that must mean a great deal.",2005
6,"It had some original stuff that displayed intelligence and thought with regards to his suit, car and weaponry.

9,"Batman Begins, the much hyped, much publicised 'reboot' of the Batman franchise is finally here and boy what a treat it is! I was a big fan of Tim Burton's take on Batman, his portrayal of the dark knight as a brooding and reluctant bringer of justice, I always felt fit perfectly with the imagery of the comic books and gave a great feel to the whole Batman mythology. The following outings of Batman Forever and Batman and Robin, were less than splendid though. Over-blown campy nonsense with two-dimensional characters being upstaged by a campy over the top rouges-gallery of villains.",2005
10,"This film is a start for a Christopher Nolan Batman film series (which I hope will continue for a long time). This film is not that good as The Dark Knight but much better than earlier Batman movies. The film is taking itself more seriously and that is what's good about it. I liked the plot very much and also a colorful characters. Maybe the film itself isn't that good as The Dark Knight but the action here is much better and here is much more of it(especially the fighting scenes). A plot, action, acting, costuming, direction - everything was great in this film. So just watch it, especially if you are action movie fan because there is a lot of action.",2008
10,"As mentioned above three legendary artists reuniting for a legendary character like Batman is more than just amazing. This movie clearly explains why Christopher Nolan movies are highly rated at IMDb. Recently the same trio combined for ""The Dark Knight"", a masterpiece sequel for this amazing film, which stormed to the #1 spot among the IMDb top 250 movies pushing the over-rated Godfather down. I didn't see the sequel yet but since its the #1 at IMDb, i have no doubts that its gonna be the best movie of the year. The Dark Knight also features late Heath Ledger, a legend in his own self, as Joker and he should be awarded an Oscar for it. I heard that he scared the s**t out of the audience during his on-screen presence in theaters. I can't wait to see this. ""Batman Begins"" also helped me to face my own fears without any fear and handle it myself which is earning me more appreciation. So more than just a movie its a lesson for life. The flawless narration, wonderful story, beautiful acting, adrenalin pumping action and emotional contents all packed in to one big action/drama entertainer and is always a treat to watch.

One of the best all star casts of the new millennium is involved including Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman, Ken Watanabe and Morgan Freeman as the film redefines both the comic book and the action genres and establishes the possibility of a motion picture within these genres to contain so much heart and meaning.",2008

10,"Mary Louise Parker plays a widowed suburban housewife forced to create new ways to generate enough income to support the lifestyle she and her family had become accustomed before her husband departed. Parker and Elizabeth Perkins are excellent representations of housewives dealing with serious problems in this unrealistic yet frighteningly realistic comedy about living in the suburbs. Unrealistic because it is doubtful that this scenario could actually take place but realistic because the actors portray real suburban characters that you might meet anywhere in the US. The PTA scenes are a scream to any mom that has attended these mundane meetings. Kevin Nealon is great as the always high accountant looking to score and Justin Kirk accurately plays Parkers outrageously screwed up brother-in-law that can't seem to stay out of trouble. Even though this is a comedy, it also examines important aspects of suburban life. Drug abuse, race relations, cancer, homosexuality, mortality and morality are all explored in a real life yet unreal setting. It kind of makes you think while you are laughing at the superb dialog.",2006

1,"This show used to be good, but it's obviously out of ideas now. The first few seasons were interesting and the storyline definitely kept you coming back every week. But now it needs to conclude or get canceled. The characters are getting stale and to be honest, Nancy has just become annoying. Her character is so boring and sullen. You just want to yell at the screen at the end of every episode, ""Get your s@#t together already"". They're ruining what was a good show by dragging it out too long. The only reason I've continued to watch is because I have nothing better to do and I'm hoping they will conclude it, but I don't know how long I can keep that up as I simply have no interest in watching this show anymore. END IT!!!",2011

Every time Doug comes on screen I'm in stitches, has to be the funniest, wittiest and dopey character ever invented for TV. This is the most creative, most hilarious TV show since friends, and definitely the most addictive. Once you watch Weeds, you'll want to watch it again and again and again.",2009
1,"I have watched 7 seasons of this rubbish. It was okay for the first 2 seasons, but it has gone down hill rapidly.

The character of Nancy Botwin and the Botwins as a whole have made that many stupid decisions that they have absolutely left me gob-smacked as to how crappy the writers have been with their ideas. I think that the writers themselves are the ones smoking weed . They keep changing the formula to the extent that they never seem to know whats going to happens themselves. I don't like it anymore, I only watch it because my girlfriend likes it and I personally cant wait for it to end.",2012
10,"when I first time I ever even heard of weeds, I thought it was going to be a ridiculous show about teenage stoners and a show about evading the police. WAS I EVER WRONG! Mary-Louise Parker's character, Nancy, is an unbelievable actress, she makes the show seem extremely real and dramatic. Elizabeth Perkins's character, Celia, you love to hate her, she is pitiful and she always has a new scheme up her sleeve. As for Justin Kirk's character, Andy, oh poor Andy, he always gets the short end of the stick, and you usually feel sorry for him. Who would have thought that Alexander Gould, little nemo, would be such a rebellious, witty, and almost shockingly intelligent aspect to the show. Shane is probably one of my favorite characters. As for Hunter Parrish, Silas, he makes me ever so angry. His lack of intelligence almost makes you want to scream sometimes, but without his knowledge of growing pot, the show wouldn't be the same. I give this show an A+++++++++++. If you don't like it you have something wrong in your head.",2009
2,"The show became increasingly less funny--and the finale barely provided a chuckle. The kids grew up too fast...Shane was just an arrogant douche in the end, and the Silas-deaf girl marriage was a lame attempt at being edgy by doing deaf jokes that were not funny. Bringing back a fringe character like Doug's gay son seemed like a cheap way to just get a gay character on the show. Not bringing back Celia-who was a main nemesis and storyline mainstay for several years-- was a huge oversight and/or slight. I just don't like the direction they took the characters in--but again, the main problem is that a comedy should provide laughs--and ""Weeds: The Roach""..get it? The end....did not provide any ha ha. Maybe being stoned would have helped.",2012

But thanks to such great writers and the amazing talent of people like Mary Louise Parker the show doesn't burn out into it's new settings it flourishes! I've seen these characters grow and do horrible things to each other. Their morals may be skewered and though Dark disturbing their actions their heart manages to stay intact.",2010

I understand its only TV land . The hypocrisy was blatant. Mary Louise Parker is supposed to be a great mom and I am supposed to believe this.... WHY ???? I just got the feeling I was being preached by a show reeking of seediness. Its like saying its OK to cheat on your wife , but with someone of legal age status.

This show was great, the acting, the characters, the setting, everything was done top notch. The show is filmed in and around Chicago, the prison they use for the setting was just closed a couple of years ago, it gives it a very authentic look. If you thought like I did(how can you make an entire series out of one prison break?), give it a try, you won't be disappointed. Besides, Fox made an entire season out of a 24 hour period.",2005
10,"I have really enjoyed watching Prison Break. This show is Adventureous, Romantic, and a little humor all in one. I do not have many favorite shows, but this one goes right at the top of my list. I am hoping Prison Break will continue airing for quite awhile. Monday nights are always exciting, just waiting to see what comes next, has me on the edge of my seat. The actors and actresses are awesome to watch. The series also has great writers. So I tip my hat to those hard workers that make this show one of the best shows on T.V. Keep up the good work guys and remember you have so many fans that love what you are doing. As I said before, Keep up the good work!!",2006
8,"Prison Break is now on its third successful season and shows no sign of this wonderful drama ending. Prison Break has everything from petty crooks to government conspiracy to crooked cops. One could have never thought that you could make a show about breaking out of jail so entertaining, or could one? This show reminds me a lot of the ShawShank Redemption. I wonder if that movie inspired the writers at all? Even though they could have been inspired, this show is definitely unique. It all starts because Linc (Dominic Purcell) was falsely accused of killing the vice presidents brother, and is now sitting on death row. Linc's brother Michael (Wentworth Miller) robbed a bank so he could land himself in prison to help break his brother out. To do this Michael has the blueprints of his escape secretly tattooed all over his body.",2007
8,"what an awesome show! for the first time since 24, a show has lived up to its hype! the entire plot, actors, everything was great. ",2005

6,"Prison break has a very good 1st season about a guy named Michael Schofield (Wentworth Miller) who decides to break his brother, Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell), who is sentenced to death out of jail, almost everything has a reason to be, the very elaborated tattoo, the structure of the plan is good, you get interested in what is going to happen, still some things don't make sense but you think that it may happen, T-Bag (Robert Knepper) and John Abruzzi (Peter Stormare) are very good characters with strong actors, I really don't know who was in charge of the cast but Kellerman had an actor out of place, Paul Adelstein looks like a comic actor. Rating 9.",2015
5,This show has lost the plot that Lost.,2008
7,"To answer all the people who are wondering why this presently has such a high rating... It's because the series is a classic and this ""resurrection"" has brought back all the loved characters and the same feel that it ended with so many years ago. It is not often nostalgia is satisfied when it comes to a forgotten TV series. I don't blame people one bit for getting carried away, after all isn't that the underlying purpose for watching anything.. Sit back and enjoy the ride down memory lane my friends!",2017
2,"The overall premise of this series appealed to me so I began watching, and enjoyed Season 1. While I understand TV and movie entertainment often has to take liberties with a plausible reality, by the fourth season this series became moment after moment of unbelievable, unrealistic, and preposterous events. We've become accustomed to the hero showing up just in the nick of time to save the day, but with Prison Break it is over and over again - the bad guys showing up just at the wrong time. Watching season 4 in particular, it was nothing but a continued string of ""how is that possible"" and ""what a coincidence"", or ""why did they do that?"". Perhaps the series just drove me to a pessimistic and overly critical nature. One example - Lincoln is about to get shot by a sniper (why was he even there? They didn't know Lincoln was going back to the restaurant? Was he just permanently posted there?), then Don shows up just in time, with a pair of binoculars (where did he get those? Why did he have those?) to scan the rooftops and spot the sniper. It was moments like those over and over again that just left me shaking my head. Season 4 is a completely different show than Season 1. Not to mention the whole ridiculousness of Scylla - how it was ""protected"" before it was stolen, exposed circuit boards for a multi-billion dollar asset, and overly complex looking for something that seemed to be little more than an external hard drive. While the show has a certain level of entertainment value, if you're going to watch all four seasons, be prepared to suspend any belief and expectation in practical, predictable human behavior and events.",2014
7,"First of all I'm a big fan of Prison Break, I consider it as one of my favorite TV shows, specially 1st and 2nd seasons.",2017
10,"Here's the thing. What captured me about prison break was not the action, violence, or the fact the characters are always on the run. What is so intriguing is the mind of Michael Scofield (Wentworth Miller). Of course the action is great. A lot of people are bashing the acting but it's a fact that Wentworth Miller is acting better in this one than he did in the prior four seasons. The first four seasons, tears, emotion, etc, were kept at bay. That could have been on purpose because usually people with high intelligence are less emotional. But he has definitely improved and his acting has gotten better. The other actors are doing fine as well. Linc is just the same as before. A little tougher, rougher, bit still Linc. Critics are just that. Critics. Take everything said, good or bad, with a grain of salt. But I'm highly enjoying the show. and I think most fans of this show, even the ones who are digging it, will still probably finish it out because...Well... Where has Michael Scofield been these past 7 years. We have missed him...",2017

5,"It's good to see all the old characters come back but this is not enough.a lot of mistakes where made here,very easy solutions and they didn't give enough attention in the details. I watch the hole 9 episodes but sometimes I cought my self wanted the episode to just finish. They had all these years to make something wonderful but the result was poor. Sorry but this is my opinion.",2017
2,"8.4? I think it is overrated. The old Prison break season 1 is awesome, the rest of the seasons are OK. This new ""Prison Break"" story line is awful & implausible. There is no soul in this ""Prison Break"". And the charm of Michael Scofield is gone. I am Prison Break fan, but this one totally let me down.",2017
2,"well you could have done better!!! i was the biggest fan of this show, watched the complete series more than 6 times and was really excited when heard that prison break is coming back..But this is shi* seriously!! Scenario, casting, acting, text, directing, illogical scenes... Lots of errors!!! I am really disappointed!! don't know how this show got 8.9 stars but it is worth 5.0 stars at this time honestly.

But a couple of days ago by chance I saw the first episode of a 3 parter arc, where they blundered with a super hacker. Now that's a subject I know a lot about and my suspension of disbelief is not THAT high to buy this story, to the point it enraged me.",2013

10,"I am a massive fan of David Boreanaz so obviously i started watching this show for him alone, but to my delight this is turning out to be one of the most well-rounded show there has been on television in years. Despite what people might have thought of David Boreanaz's acting abilities, by starring in Bones he has proved that he is a well rounded actor whom can take any role and make it his own. The rest of the cast has been perfectly selected to bounce of David and make the show the best there can be. Also i am impressed with how Emily has turned out as an actor, in the first few episodes i thought she was a bit of a hollow actress, kind of carboardy, but i have since been proved very wrong and feel bad for terrible of how quick i judged her. I can only hope than this show continues to be made for a least another couple of years so we fans can find out as much as there is to know about our beloved characters. P.S To Fox Please please do not be as cruel as the bigwigs at the WB and cancel this show at the prime of it's run as it would be a dying shame and also doing this would grossly reduce your viewers. Thanks Danielle",2006
2,"When I initially began watching this show I found it to be somewhat enjoyable. There were a few funny dynamics and some of the cases encountered were fairly interesting. However, as time went on I found the show to become increasingly more gimmicky and unrelatable. Each new episode involved the team to investigate a murder that occurred in some new niche that was far too extreme, in my opinion. The people didn't feel like real people, they were all defined by a single trait (artisan businesses, mole people, Amish life). ",2015
3,"Unrealistice?, you might ask. Yeah, that's my impression as I see this department loaded with young, beautiful people (mostly) that are alway so in touch with their feelings, smart dressing, unfailingly witty, women so sharply dressed and made up (with hairstyles to match) that one can't help but wonder if this isn't a fashion show in disguise, and so wise beyond their years. I can't imagine a department that didn't have people who weren't physically unattractive, perhaps not sharp at times, and yes, sometimes at a loss for a witty comeback.",2010

I read all her books, the more I read the more I liked this complicated, but yet so sympathetic woman who lives in two total different states, who herself has so many different faces. And now she is one Hollywood-style, action-loaded, simply ridiculously acting woman with no character.

I have nothing against marriage or babies it just that a crime show is not meant to be a family show. That is my mom opinion on the show, mine is I have to agree ! It was meant to be a forensic crime drama, with comic undertones. Not a family show where everyone gets married and has a baby, I mean not against the marriage and baby scene. But it needs to be toned down a lot , because it doesn't make good TV! There has to be a balance, somewhere. If one couple had a baby that is one thing but everyone. Instead of calling it Bones you might as well title it Babyboom the series.",2012

I have no idea how this show has been so popular and I'm wondering why on Earth people compare this to the epic comedy: Friends. very boring. And to be honest, I didn't feel it had a cohesive storyline, and the people or the story didn't seem to get anywhere. Just a bunch of separate ""jokes"" and moments. I wasn't excited about the ending of the first season and didn't even realize, when Netflix started to roll the second season. To me it felt the same all the time...And the characters just seem to lack personality.",2016

Marshal and Lilly are Ted's best friends they are together for 9 years and are planning a wedding with all the consequences coming from that. Barny is the Casanova of the company. He's funny and arrogant in a very humouristic way. The director's method's are different and will keep your attention in these cute series.",2006

1,"How I met your mother was recommended by a so called ""friend"" it was an utter disappointment. there was no memorable moments apart from when I almost ended everything mid way through the first episode. I would rather drink bleach every time barney talks rather than listen to his forgetful lines of dialogue written by 8 year old kids with some sort of syndrome. This is a 1 out of 10 would not recommend to anyone (even Hitler)as this sort of punishment should be left to Korean prisons as a way to turn pedophiles into vegetables. the best part about the entire series was when Marshalls dad died I could not wait for him to have that heart attack. This is the only reason its a 1 and not a 0. after watching the show I regret all of my life choices and wish I didn't meet your mother. overall I would rather watch the country bears over and over than watch this piece of cabbage malarkey.",2016

Actors act like ten year old children in a school play... Dull  sceneries... Please tell me whom I have to blame for approving the  pilot episode???   A show about a guy who informs his children of how he met their mother  by telling them about his irrelevant relationships, long enough to see  his own kids going to retirement by the time he finishes his story...  Whats the point here...??? - ""Hey dad, how did you met our mother???"" -  ""Well... I had about 100 relationships that ended bad but don't worry I  ll tell you everything about them...""  That lame character is supposed to be an architect when he cant even  answer a simple question? Its like asking how many are 2 plus 2  oranges??? And the answer is.... Well...

Finally the worst part of all...  - Eh, no that wasn't actually what happened... its... , Oh no I don't  remember... oh I do now... Or was it the other way around???

But some people I know are just watching because , and I quote 'they feel like they have to because they followed it for so long' but they all say its terribly unfunny now and disappointing. I mean really Carter Bays do you want people to watch your show because of that? Don't you want everyone to watch it because its funny and original? Terrible, terrible, terrible.. And sad part is - seasons 1-3 were awesome and hilarious. Sad",2013
1,"I don't know how the show became so popular. I watched only one season and i didn't laugh once. I smiled few times though. ( I watched it only because I downloaded it after hearing about it) The comedy is so childish and felt like they are imposing the comedy on the viewers. The story never moves... There is no life in the characters, and it looks very fictional. Barney is the amateur version of joy in friends, Stella is the worst form of Rachel, the husband (dont even remember his name) is a stone sculpture of Chandler, and Tobby wants to be Ross.. Each characters are based on Friends in its worst form.",2013
4,"At the beginning this show WAS really entertaining, funny, good jokes and everything was in place. But it turned out like bad friends. I guess they decided to prolong finding ""Mother"" just because of popularity. Everybody sleeps with everybody and that's normal and they are ""friends"" after all no matter they slept each other. Seems like only Marshall and Lilly are normal in this. I really hated when Ted decided to leave Victoria because of Robin. Should we abandon our partners because of dumb friends? So immature.",2012
6,"I loved the beginning of the show, it was fun, sophisticated, realistic and anyone could relate to it. However, something happened and it gradually stopped making any sense. The jokes were not that funny anymore, the characters absurd and the plot weird. I was looking forward to the last season to finally finish the story, but the ending was nothing but a disappointment. All those seasons for the mother to just die in the end and such a big deal about Robin and Barney for them to just divorce and go back to the place they were in the very first season?! I suspect that the authors just didn't know what to do with the characters and just wanted to end the show anyhow. Last season honestly killed it all for me and my friends.

5,"A re-imagining of Friends via Coupling but missing what made these work. Two attractive but dreary female leads who most of the time could just as easily not be there for all the use the scriptwriters make of them. Then there are the 3 male leads, Ted a moronic romantic who falls for every girl he meets is infatuated by them on Monday and has run away from them by Tuesday, Barney a deeply unpleasant misogynist who treats his friends and the various women he beds with utter disdain (are women really that stupid), and then there is Marshall a hulking child prone to tantrums and violence. Of course all the males have wonderful careers despite their various social inadequacies. The main problem outwith that is that after a decade the characters really have not grown or learnt anything. try The Big Bang Theory instead.",2016

The jokes are the standard relationship nonsense we have all seen a million times before, the characters feel soulless and boring and pretty much all episodes have an absolutely completely uninteresting story. I just cant imagine how this show made it as big as it did as we have seen it all before but never quite this bad. Biggest problem is however the character Barney who is a womanizing partydude that is completely non believable. Without any doubt the most uncharismatic character i have ever seen, yes EVER! The people behind this show should be executed for crimes against humanity and the mastertapes should be buried in the mariana trench to prevent it from ever resurfacing.",2016

Ever since then, I've pretty much caught every episode on its broadcast, except for the odd one where I've been away or indisposed. In 2007, I decided to take a look at the Classic Series - my first story was Genesis of the Daleks, and I've loved it ever since. Slowly, I've collected and watched almost every Classic episode available, following the ""junking"" back in the 60s, and I've come to love Doctor Who as part of my life, like a dog or a cat, something I can be with from time to time and have a smile on my face. In 2008, I even started scouring for Big Finish Audios, novels and comics, and I'm still collecting them to this day. ",2014

While not episode is perfect, every episode can be appreciated. While the main idea of the show doesn't change, the show has experimented in many ways. The show is ever changing, with the main cast being swapped every few years. With such a big history, there's a reason the show still stands strong to this day. The episodes give nods to the past, and hints to the future. With this capability, it truly has an infinite potential. ",2015
10,"Doctor Who just works. However you watch it, as a fan or casual viewer, there is something there for you; and if there's not, well, try a different era. It helps that it's got 52 years currently under its belt, and so there is and has been for a long time, an element of nostalgia to the show-- recurring villains, references, companions or places/planets that get revisited just to please the people who've been watching long enough. But that's not all there is to it: because every year, there's some kind of hidden gem of an episode that's a shining example of great television, along with the scary, funny, tense episodes we have all come to expect from this show. One of its strongest merits is its constant adaptability. There are different writers almost every week, different companions every other series, different doctors, different locations, directors, genres, threats and ideas. For every one abysmal episode (and there are a few of them), there are some absolutely stunning ones too. I'd recommend Heaven Sent, Bad Wolf/Parting of the Ways, The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances, Blink, The Pandorica Opens, A Good Man Goes to War, Asylum of the Daleks, Flatline, and The Day of the Doctor. It's a show that never dies. Of course, it will get cancelled at some point, maybe, just as it did before; and then it will live on. It will get picked up again. TV just isn't the same without it.

Doctor Who is thrilling, action packed, emotional, funny, and dramatic- and it does this in a way that makes it fun to watch while not being too heavy like The Walking Dead or Breaking Bad. The main reason why Doctor Who is my favorite show is because it encapsulates everything good and bad about humanity to create a feel good series. It's plain old fun, yet its scary, surprisingly emotional, and thought provoking. The acting, the music, and the script writing as a whole are phenomenal, especially as the show progresses. ",2016

Was it going to live up to the expectations I had carried around since I was little? Would they screw it up? Would the Dr. suck? Would his assistant suck? Would they create a more intimate relationship with the Dr. and his assistant? YES, NO, NO, NO, NO!!! This show is wonderful!! I love the new Dr. I love his assistant. I love the show.

But after a brief but violent infatuation with David Walliams made me watch the episode ""The God Complex,"" which just happens to be a really good horror tale, I started brushing up on my BBC Wales-era DW (Doctor Who not David Walliams.) This show has such an irresistible concept that it's possible to be a fan just of the idea of it, and such a vast backlist of episodes at this point that it would take a very dedicated DW geek to go back and watch them all, let alone investigate all the ancillary audio recordings, comic books, novels et al. I think this is one of the reasons for the phenomenon of fans having ""their Doctor.""

9,"I remember when I first watched it in 2005 on CBC, the Canadian Broadcast Channel. It was the reboot and the writing was pretty good and some of the effects. Then during the David Tenant years I started to love it and it imprinted a lot on me since I was growing up around that time. Then I started watching the classic Doctor Who on Netflix, iTunes, and anywhere I could find it. I even have some of the DVD's of the classic who even the very first episode arcs. I was shocked to know that some of the early work from the 60's was lost in a fire. I learned that from this episode recap from Channel Awesome from some guy called Diamanda Hagan. Some of the behind the scenes stuff he talked about I was shocked to know. Like in the Colin Baker years and the Sylvester McCoy years. In new Doctor Who I was a little skeptical of the Matt Smith years since you might not know what you get with a new doctor. He ended up taking a lot from the second doctor Patrick Troughton and it seemed to work. This show also made it into the world record book for the longest running TV show ever. I even remember they did a thing on BBC America where they did a Doctor every month. To get you hyped for the Day of the Doctor 50th years special and when they actually aired it I just loved it. Also the end of the special I didn't quite see coming but it was pretty clever. The Peter Calpaldi years I'm a little skeptical since he's different from the last doctor but maybe I just need to let him sink in.",2015
8,"I'm going to be honest. I never had the desire to watch Dr. Who. I knew there was a growing fan base out there, but I didn't understand why. Then my son decided to start watching it on Netflix. I thought ""ok, why not?"" It was a change from the usual boring Disney shows he watches. I watched a bit of the first episode (9th Doctor) not bad. Not great, but not bad. My son was hooked. I missed most of the following episodes after that. Then I sat down and watched a couple episodes with the 10th Dr. (David Tennant). OK this is getting good.... I suddenly found myself hooked. Omg I actually like this show. I even went back and watched all the episodes I missed. I try to keep myself from binge watching the entire series but it's not easy. One of the main things I love about Dr. Who is the fact that it is a show that I am 100% comfortable with my kids watching. You can't find a show like that anymore. Thank you, for a show that my entire family can sit down to and not be bored out of our minds or worried about if the content is appropriate for kids and young teens. I am extremely grateful.",2015
10,"Absolutely amazing. For over fifty years, we have enjoyed the adventures of The Doctor. He has been young, old, had long hair, had short hair, been tall, been short, and he has had many companions. Rose Tyler, Donna Noble, Martha Jones, K-9, Amy Pond, Rory Williams, Clara Oswin Oswald, Captain Jack Harkness, Mickey Smith, Wilfred Mott, Susan Foreman, Ian Chesterton, Barbara Wright, Jamie McCrimmon, Jo Grant, Leela, Romana, Ace, and the best, Sarah Jane Smith, to name a few of them. The acting has always been top notch, and the characters and storyline have always been some of the best around. The special effects have gotten much better since 1963, and it now looks absolutely fantastic. The Tenth Doctor is my favorite Doctor, followed by the Fourth. I highly recommend this show, it is hard to explain just how great it really is.",2014
10,"My review only intends to be a global one about all the new series, from 2005. I did not watch yet the original series from the sixties but I started with the new one. Episode by episode, I was converted into a unconditional fan. You can found emotion, fun, humor, suspense, adorable punchlines, unforgettable characters other than the Doctors, delightful Britishness and much more. By the other hand, the stories are simply good sometimes and excellent more frequently. You can enjoy the very different personalities of each Doctor. I was a previous fan of Christopher Eccleston and David Tennant so their high performances was what I expected. But about Matt Smith?. He is a real discovery. You must see him.",2014
10,"I first decided to watch Doctor who when it was relaunched in 2005 as my parents had kept on telling me how good it was. As I had nothing to do on that Saturday night I decided that it would not hurt to give the show a chance. After watching the debut episode of the relaunch, ""Rose"", I found it highly enjoyable. Two things I enjoyed the most about the show was the energy that the characters carried and the unique story line, it felt confident and was not afraid to be different. Of course after watching Episode 1 I decided to give the following few weeks a chance to see if the show continued to carry on dishing out creative and fun episodes.",2008
10,"Back in 1963, a low budget science fiction television series was launched primarily aimed at educating children during Saturday teatimes, called Doctor Who. Slipping under the radar due in no small part to the assassination of President Kennedy, the show suddenly became the hottest property on British television just six weeks into its run with the introduction of The Daleks. The Daleks propelled the show into another stratosphere and became a merchandising phenomenon in the 1960s, which guaranteed the series a shelf life much longer than was originally planned or anticipated. The blank canvas doesn't come much bigger - any episode could be set at any time, in any world, anywhere. And add to that the genius of the central character being able to regenerate without the need to ruin audience expectation, and you had television gold. And so began an amazing run of 26 years with the Doctor portrayed by seven different actors, before the wheels began falling off. The decline can be traced back to the late 1980s. Tom Baker, largely considered by many fans to be the ultimate Doctor (before the emergence of David Tenant who now has a claim to the throne) ended his hugely successful run in 1981, and youthful producer John Nathan-Turner replaced him with popular TV actor Peter Davison. Whilst Davison's era was highly competent and successful, both in terms of ratings and quality, it was Turner's decision to install Colin Baker in 1984 that was the beginning of the end. Baker's crass and incredibly ill-judged portrayal alienated viewers and as ratings fell, it was no surprise that then-BBC chief Michael Grade gave the show a deliberate 18 month rest. Sylvester McCoy was then handed the role, and whilst his tenure is regularly derided by fans, he was harshly treated. His realignment of the part was excellent, but by now the show had degenerated into almost pantomime type farce. Turner was obsessed with attracting big name guest stars to the show - witness the likes of Ken Dodd, Richard Briers and Sheila Hancock, but was accused of taking his eye off the ball as the story lines and dialogue descended into cringing embarrassment. We were no longer hiding behind sofas because of the terror of the aliens - we were hiding from the show itself. The show's darkest hour was when McCoy's Doctor was faced with an enemy in The Happiness Patrol called the Kandy Man who just happened to resemble a giant liquorish allsort. And it seemed that when the show was finally axed a year later in 1989, it would be forever confined to the memories of TV yesteryear. An abortive effort to revive the show in 1996 using a TV movie with Paul McGann only served to remind us that the show was best left on the shelf.",2009

I can't remember where I was when I saw my first episode, but it was back in the 70's on Public Television (here in the US), and I was just a kid. The fourth Doctor was the star, and from that point, I was hooked! So, just what is so great about it??? The entertainment value is phenomenal, the special effects are cheesy; yet timeless, and the drama draws a person in with its cleverness and wit. What's not to like?!? Sometimes the Doctor is a clumsy bumbling fool, and others he is a remarkable genius, but he always gets through to the end.",2008

9,"This is a genuinely funny show, well worth watching, and deserving of it's high ratings on this site. It's compared to South Park for a number of reasons, most notably the enthusiasm with which it tackles socially sensitive issues and assaults them with the most extremist brands of political incorrectness --- but whereas South Park always tries to tidy up it's mess and make sure the audience knows the distinction between right and wrong, this show revels in the depravity and insanity of it's sociopathy.

10,"There are so few television comedies that generate as much humor with generally unlikable characters, and ""Sunny"" probably tops the list. ""Strangers With Candy"" and ""Absolutely Fabulous"" come closest to capturing the laugh-out loud comedy it generates. Part abstract theatre, part absurdist drama, ""Sunny"" not only skewers every hot-button issue imaginable, but barbecues and presents it as a scrumptuous entree. And the zingers ... ""Which one of you fags is my dad?"" and ""You might as well call it Rape Bar"" are killer. Plus being a Philly boy myself, the opening montage with images of The Linc and 30th Street Station are always good for a smile. With ""Drawn Together"" set for its impending exit, ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"" is the reigning TV king of comedy.",2007
10,"A cheap show, a crazy gang, a lot of guts to say whatever they want, what more can I ask for?

10,"It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia is one of the greatest shows on TV right now. It is daring and hilarious. It was created by three guys on a budget of less than $200, which I find very admirable because I am and aspiring actor/writer. Its raucous stories that run the gamut from cancer to abortion to Nazis to pedophilia are written by the cast. Their devotion to the show is very evident and I hope we will not lose this great show to politics of Hollywood. Heading into is second season I am excited to see what we are going to tackle this summer. I am ready to be shocked and amazed at the lengths these guys and a girl will go to to get over. And with Danny Devito joining the show we are really seeing how ""sunny"" it is in ""Philadelphia""",2006
10,"There hasn't been a show in the world that makes me laugh as hard or as often than It's Always Sunny in its prime. Seasons 1 through 5 have some of the best, sharpest comedy writing in ages. Since then, the show hasn't been as consistently brilliant, but there are gems in every season. The premise is very simple. It's about the life of four Philly bar owners. At least until season 2 brings in the father of siblings Dennis and Dee, Frank Reynolds, played to perfection by Danny DeVito, where it becomes a fearless fivesome of hilarity. The thing is, these aren't your ordinary people. They're delusional, narcissistic, borderline-psychotic idiots. The show has been described as ""Seinfeld on crack"" and that's about as good a descriptor you can get. The gang are always coming up with ridiculous schemes and stupid ideas which consistently result in awkwardness and belly laughs. ",2016
10,"Well TV sociopaths can indeed. In the same fashion as Seinfeld and Arrested development, this show deals with a group of unlikeable misfits while they engage in moronic adventures based in equally moronic impulses. The difference with those spiritual predecessors is that Sunny takes it a step further. As the tagline of the show indicates (""Seinfeld on a crack) the writers of this show not only embrace the selfishness of their characters but takes it a step further by completely severing their social awareness and empathy towards other human beings. The result, needless to say, is not only sometimes disturbing, but utterly hilarious. Here is a small introduction of each one of the characters:",2011
10,I can only only assume the negative reviews for this show comes from the people who find such programs as 'mike and molly' 'big bang theory' and '2 and a half men' funny and rely on canned laughter to tell them when something just funny has happened. I must admit i stumbled across this program whilst in bed in Vegas wishing i hadn't started drinking in the day and it made me vomit with laughing...i'm not usually a huge fan of US comedies as they are few and far between but when one comes along like this it baffles me that there is that much crap on US TV?!?! The characters are perfect together and whilst at 1st was dubious about DeVito's role i've grown to him and think he's perfect too. More like this America and you'll be forgiven for the amount of terrible alleged comedies you roll out and 'reality'....if you can call them reality rubbish.,2012

All the other comedies on TV don't amount to this. Sure, maybe they do in awards but ""IASIP"" isn't built for the popularity contest, in the DVD's the actors come out and say they like the fans the fans are what moves them.

9,"Over the years on FX I would tune in and catch an episode of ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"" from time to time. Only eventually it would be just like getting hooked on something as now I'm a faithful viewer of the series it's just like a religion. And who wouldn't be hooked the series it pushes the envelope it's far out funny and crude and rude as it just doesn't give a hoot and all of the characters are risk takers and speak it like it is about the world as I agree with them it's time we come down on this society more as it's became to much of a yes man and politically correct one. And the chemistry between the actors and guest is top notch. As it's a watch for the legendary Danny Devito who shines here as he proves he's not to good to do a cable comedy sitcom after being in many big screen movies it doesn't affect his legendary status.",2009

They are dishonest, egotistical, lazy, manipulative and vengeful. Episodes usually find them hatching elaborate schemes, conspiring against one another and others for personal gain, vengeance, or simply for the entertainment of watching each other's downfall. Their tactics often rely on inflicting emotional and sometimes physical and psychological pain on individuals both deserving and undeserving. They regularly use blackmail and manipulate one another and others outside of the group.",2011

10,"Think South Park in South Philly. Danny Devito does just enough to anchor the cast but still allows the younger and lesser known co-stars to develop their characters around him. Often times, a more established actor with Devito's credentials will wash out the co-stars and smother the show. This is not the case with Sunny. Put simply, this show works. It may take another solid season for this show to cultivate a substantial core audience. But it seems FX is willing to stick with it long enough to find out. Even if FX decides to run this show up against the big boys (CBS' ""Without a Trace"") in the fall, Thursdays at 10pm is a perfect time slot. Sunny is gritty and dark at times, but in a harmless and smart kind of way. Kudos, FX...This show is a winner!",2006

I'm working my way through Series 3 and have series 4 and 5 to look forward to. It's amazing how much the writers can get into 20 minutes. I like it when there is a double episode. I too am so glad there is no laughter track (which has stopped me watching quite a few comedy shows). I have noticed in this third series that the camera can be very annoying when it whizzes from character to character - far too quickly. Completely unnecessary. Steve's ""Michael"" conveys so much about the character - he's full of himself but so vulnerable and anxious for friends. Rainn Wilson's ""Dwight"" is just brilliant. And I love the company name - ""Dunder Mifflin""!",2011

7,"After reading all of the horrible reviews coming from the UK, I felt the strong desire to comment. I learned that most of the reviewers bashing it have only seen a few (at most) episodes from the first season - many haven't seen it at all, and are simply bashing it because of an overwhelming sense of pride in the original. I'd be surprised if this review isn't skimmed over and marked unhelpful by them. Obviously I'm not speaking to all the British, but the majority that unfairly judge this show with little to no basis in the truth. ",2007
10,"I watched the British version of The Office and became a fan - as almost everyone. So I decided to see if the American version was as good as the original. A doubt feeling emerged at the first episode, since I still was with the original - and awesome - characters in mind. They were not just funny, but peculiar, inimitable. I didn't let this impression ruin my experience, though. Gladly. The American version is obviously inspired in the British version, but they are not the same. Simple like this. The American characters are not mere counterparts of David, Tim, Gareth, Dawn... They are hole new versions of the kind of people we can easily find in any office. And equally inspired versions of these workers. Since I've lost several episodes when they aired for the first time, I'm now at the third season, and I will surely see all the episodes through the end. More than one time...",2010
6,"When I found out that they were making an American version of The Office, one of the most heart-stoppingly good situation comedies, I thought, ""Why?"" I thought that it would be simply awful, like many Americanised shows. I found a link for the Myspace pilot. I started it, and it actually wasn't too bad. It really wasn't. I really enjoyed it. It was really good. One of the funniest bits was where Mr. Brown got the little card that said ""black"" (I won't go further than that, and the show didn't go too far into that anyways, but it was really funny just seeing that). To be honest, it was one of the most excellent Americanisations of a British shows. There were some great moments, like the east Indian woman coming back into the room and the boss going ""Hallo! Welcom to my stor! Vuld yu like sum gooki-gooki? Tri my gooki-gooki!"".",2005

10,"I only started seeing this series on this year and i'm on the 6th season already. on the first season i couldn't understand how this could be a good series, the actors were charismatic and the acting were very good but there was almost no story that i could follow and Michael seemed like a very hateable person. on the second season things started to pick up a bit but nothing so special. from the third season to the sixth i got completely hooked because after all there is a story to follow, a very interesting one, and Michael is in fact a genius and that is more evident on the fifth and sixth seasons. if someone believes that Michael does something that goes against the objectives that he has inside the company (even if a lot of times it seems that he does), i'm sure that that person isn't really understanding what's the main philosophy behind Michael's character. it took me 3 seasons to understand Michael Scott and it was because of that, that i didn't liked the series very much, after that, i loved it, and it's my favorite series now. When you do understand all the characters, besides being very entertaining and delightful to watch, it is going to blow your mind sometimes.",2010
9,"I am a huge fan of the British version of the Office. I remember looking forward to the American version when it first came out and being disappointed immediately to the point that I refused to watch it after the first episode. Almost 6 years later I gave it another go as people were telling me that it was actually quite good. I took the advice that I should start from season 2. This time around I enjoyed it more and gradually warmed to the characters that were basically copies of the British version. I can't believe that I would ever say this, but this show is as good as the British version. The bonus is that there is a lot more of it. It was certainly a knee-jerk reaction to give up on it so quickly, but it seems that a lot of people did. The Jim/Pam relationship is a clone of Tim and Dawn, but some of the pranks that they play on Dwight(Gareth in British version) are quite brilliant. There are certainly differences between the two versions, but generally the American version stays fairly true to the original.",2010
9,"As a fan of the original ""Office"" I was, of course, skeptical about the American remake. We have many shining beacons to shows that have bombed badly when transferred across the ocean. However, pinch me I must be dreaming, this version of the show is actually very good.

The first episode wasn't my favorite. But you become attached to the characters so quickly! It is hard to say that Michael is just an idiot, he has so much heart and just wants to be loved. I don't care what anyone says, Dwight is hilarious. And the show can be so easy to relate to sometimes. Don't tell me you have never had your Jim or your Pam. I mean, there are so many human moments that sometimes it leaves me feeling emotional (though they are rarer). And it definitely has its uncomfortable moments (especially when Toby starts to get creepy). There is so much good to this show, and it is so unlike so many of the terrible shows out there. I can understand loyalty, and I know America and Britain are different countries. But if you get past the FIRST episode and really give it a chance, there is a lot to love here! I have never seen the original Office, and I intend to watch it someday. And I promise I will keep an open mind.",2009

Practically everyday after work and after finishing what needed to be done I'd watch several episodes and have done so from start to finish. I have been captivated by every character and to watch their personalities develop I almost had to ask myself if this was really a TV series or a real documentary. Even though the characters were slightly dramatized, I had coworkers or friends that had similar traits to 'almost' all of them so that made it even more personal. Having just watched the last episode I was surprised on how sad I became to not be able to come home and see what new adventures the office was going to go through. The show was very captivating and really pulled you into their lives. I think the people that don't like the show probably didn't start from the beginning and only watched several episodes because, to be honest, after the first several episodes of the 1st season I was going to stop watching it but I'm glad I didn't.",2014
9,"This show is flat out funny. From Steve Carrell's perfect performance of Michael Scott to Rainn Wilson's even better portrayal of the ever-funny, ever-maniacal Dwight Schrute. Aside from the humor, there is a very good sense of character development and relationships as well, which is refreshing. Jim and Pam are the go-to couple for a comedy couple. Going back to the first few seasons I would get frustrated because I would just be dying for them to be together, but that adds to the fun and intrigue of the show. The other supporting characters are also very funny such as Stanley, Andy and probably my personal favorite secondary character: Kevin. The flaws of this show are two things: When Michael left, the show was good but not the same, and Andy became quite annoying as the show played on. A highlight of the later seasons is Erin; she is pretty, funny, and a dork--which is perfect for my sense of humor. All told, this is a great show that is definitely worth binge-watching, but just make sure you can stay up(that's what she said).",2014

In season 5 I think it started to go downhill slowly but surely, with poor writing. Season 6 has been absolutely abysmal, with getting rid of JJ and Prentiss, and the writing has left a lot to be desired. If you're going to watch Criminal Minds, I really recommend watching seasons 1, 2, 3 and 4 in order and judging for yourself but I think you'll find the earlier seasons are infinitely better than the crap they're giving us now.

And we have seen shows that we may have liked like the profiler that we know isn't correct. It doesn't happen that way. I will say that I enjoyed it.The only other show I truly miss is Fox's The Inside. That was a good one as well but nothing like this. I have bought at least ten books on profiling that discuss different types of psychopaths,how they were created and the different psychological issues that surrounds their behavior and fantasies. How because of their bad experience during childhood and after they have learned to profile and manipulate people,the disorganized crime scene compared to organized scene and mixed crime scene and what it tells you about the unsub. Learning their geographic profile. All these things are in this show to give us a pretty reasonable idea of what they do. How they are made. Why they exist and do what they do. I find it fascinating not only to watch psychopaths and their crimes but to some extent through their fiction, learn something about them. John Douglas says he saw John Gacy and looked him right in the eye when in fact he never did so I don't really take his word about what his job was like. But many others, like Robert Ressler describe this profession in a similar way as Criminal Minds. I hope it stays on. It is the coolest. Just to clarify, I like learning why they do it. I hate what they do and how it hurts people. I don't wan't people to think I enjoy entertainment for the sake of seeing people pain or horror. I think you will enjoy this show too. The actors have a great chemistry together already. Reid is my favorite. He makes you laugh when he really is meanting too. He give the crew the most character I think.",2006

The three main things which I like are 1) the way they deal with violence and gore 2) the way each team member has its own special talents and use them to piece a part of the big crime puzzle 3) The way they look out for each other and act as one cohesive unit. I don't know why this show has not received the media attention , limelight, reviews and attention it deserves. I mean there are no outtakes, no behind the scenes, bloopers, nothing (zilch). Maybe it is because of money problems that the show keeps running into time and again, as pointed out by other contributors. But the reason the show gets renewed season after season every year is a testament to its substance and the talent of its cast.",2015

10,"The drama/mystery/thriller ""Criminal Minds"" is truly an amazing show. I started only watching it couple of months ago, and I can't believe that it took me so long to discover it. This is the show where each episode reminds me of my favorite book on the subject of finding the serial killers by trying to get inside their minds and to think the way they do, and equally terrific adaptation, Red Dragon by Thomas Harris/Manhunter by Michael Mann. Again and again the team of the brilliant profilers, fly from their headquarters in Quantico, VA to different locations all over the country to put their minds together and complete the profile of the mysterious unsub (unknown subject) and to prevent the next strike which would be deadly. This is a very difficult, demanding and exhausting job where the lives of innocent people are at stake and every minute, even second matters. This job takes its toll from every member of the team. Often they have to make very difficult choices and more than once they face the deadly danger not only to themselves but to those who are the closest to them. ",2012
1,"I been viewing this show since it started and all I see is the same Plot. ""unsub"" is deranged FBI must come in to help ignorant police and local detectives who cannot point out the obvious but somehow these ""Saviors"" must help us ""normal"" people out like we cannot decipher things out ourselves. Plus we must sit through the ""bad"" agent Derek Morgan work out his demons by beating out suspects (who are somehow related or the actual perpetrators) to reconcile his demeanor. I would only continue to like this show if somehow they would change the setting. like the police in whatever city they are in would not be so ignorant and make a difference. Kind of makes you think of how Hollywood sees the People and would recognize. But I guess if it sells it sells.",2012
2,"I have watched this show since day one. I am sorry to say without Hotchner this show is doomed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The woman that is now in charge was so-so as just one of the group but as the boss she is pathetic! The three newest ""actors"" are really bad. The black woman that used to be Ross' girlfriend on friends is okay, the hispanic guy is mediocre and the latest guy, the MONOTONE black guy is just so horrible, how could anyone have cast him on this show??????? Just listening to his boring voice is enough to put any insomniac to sleep..........",2017
1,"This show has denigrated into the biggest stinking pile of garbage I have seen in a long time. This baby boy/baby girl crap between Garcia, the overweight creepy, weepy computer tech. and one of the BAU has got to be the most ridiculous piece of writing I have seen in a long time. Then you throw in Prentiss and the genius geek with all their personal problems and it equals an extremely weak writing staff without any ideas except falling back on the BAU members personal and family problems. Jeez, talk about a big pile of stink. I used to watch and DVR this show when it first came on the air, now I do not even bother, especially when I see an episode with some sort of member problem like Garcia and her boyfriend. Who gives a crap about her personal problems. Do your job, suck it up or start a Hallmark store with Prentiss and the other weak members of your team.",2012
3,"I have watched every single episode of Criminal Minds up until this past season. I have enjoyed the intricate plots, the character development, the story lines. I have to say that over the last year, the whole feel of the show has completely changed. Too many character departures, too many new character faces, and now Reid in jail? Come on Criminal Minds. I just can't anymore. I am not enjoying it at all anymore and I couldn't finish the season. So, now I have decided that I have to quit you. And in all honesty, I don't know if I'll miss you.",2017
2,"I originally came to write this as my stomach would not allow me not to. That's possibly bad English but I'm feeling nauseous so please forgive me. I'm nauseous because my wife watches this ''show'' and occasionally I am in the same room, picking up the corny lines, empty characters and vapid (or is it vacuous?) conclusions expressed by the main leads; it hurts me that this disgustingly non-representative example of how criminals are caught (if they ever are) can be enjoyed by an individual I consider intelligent. That hurts. Apparently this drama is enjoyed by many. Other individuals say it ''rips off' CSI and NCIS. Who cares? I've been subjected to those (and all the derivatives too) and they are no better. I am a citizen of the United Kingdom, I watch the news. From what I can gather none of this is real, at least in its depiction of catching criminals. It's not realistic, it's not factual, but it is unpleasant and designed (the episodes) to nauseate. Mission accomplished? I think not. Burn it.",2017

You can divide the dialogue into categories: putting someone down, describing an ""unsub"", delivering plot points (narrative), cool sounding sound-bites and the occasional, extremely rare, actual human interaction.",2009
1,"Criminal Minds seems to fall in the category of popular enough that people who loves lazily written, simple to follow, repetitive garbage will watch it in masses, but bad enough that most critics, professional or online, prefers not to acknowledge its existence. I normally don't do reviews, however with this show heading into it's 9th season, proper criticism is long overdue. Crime procedurals is not a TV genre I'm a fan of and generally avoid them. However I started watching this show after seeing the short lived series Higher Ground and thinking AJ Cook really had potential. After seeing all her later movies, this show was all that's left so I started watching it and hoped it wasn't too bad. I set my standards too high.",2013
2,"I officially stop watching this stupid show tonight after seeing the premise: beating people over the head, tying them to a car bumper & dragging their bodies on the road. I started watching this show 5 years ago because I like Joe Mantegna, but he's only in it for the paycheck. The early seasons had intriguing stories and chemistry among the cast. Now every single episode is about a sick, sadistic man (usually) who abducts people and cuts their body parts off, or tortures people to death because the writers can't think of anything else. In one episode, a killer gouges victims eyes out. Another, he cuts their ears off. Another, he cuts people's internal organs out.",2012
10,"I personally have been waiting to see a show based on spooky plots and this show delivers. Supernatural is somewhat endearing in that the main characters (the only ones who will be recurring) are brothers, however, the writing makes the characters more believable. They are different from each other, each with their own take on life and things that are not typical. I think as the show goes on it will continue to get better,though it is great now. I can't wait to see more of this show! ",2005
9,"During the 90's I was a big fan of the X-Files to this day I still am. The X-Files had great stories and character development, which is needed for a great show. Supernatural has that from the very first episode. I admit that I missed the first 10 minutes of the show, but I knew exactly what happened and where the story was going. Most shows you tune into after the first few minutes your lost and you lose interest, unlike Supernatural. CBS's Threshold, may not live up to the X-Files, but Supernatural does. ",2005
10,"When the show started I will admit I was apprehensive. It was compared to ghost busters and most notably X-files, but the first episode was everything but. It was action packed with two bad-ass brothers fighting no not crime, but ghosts. Spirits. The writers have done their research into urban legends and local myths, building on spooks we've grown up hearing about, sometimes beings scared of, and other's apprehensive. They give these spooks a face and then send Dean and Sam to blow them to smithereens. ",2006
7,"After being disappointed by mediocre to bad new shows like Threshold  and Invasion, I am glad that there's at least one new show that really  delivers. Supernatural is in a whole different league, with proper  style, suspense and great production values. This is a  dark, moody show that understands how to use the television medium. The  story isn't exactly complex, but the storytelling technique pulls you  in and holds your attention, making you want to know more about the  supernatural beings and the rules that govern their shadow world. I'm  usually not a fan of darkness and horror, but this show is effective.  It's dark urban fantasy and it has the potential to go a long way.  As it is, the show is way, waay above average, and I rate the pilot  episode an 8 out of 10.",2005
10,"Now this show is not without problems. I'll be the first to admit it. It's very basic premise and sometimes convenient plot turns are not lost on me. Two monster hunting brothers travel cross country and extinguish a different monster each week. Not too much on the original side, I know. However, I can't help but watch this show every week with a fondness for my old junior high days. For those who don't know I was a huge sci-if/horror geek in my younger years and I loved reading about ""The Crazy Hook Man who kills Teenagers"" or ""The Ghost of the Lady in White"". I ate those stories up, and apparently so did the show's creator. This show takes me back to the years before I learned what character arcs, and plot contrivances were. It strips that all away and just lets me enjoy what it was like to hear ghost stories. What it was like to get chills down my spine every time I rode down a dark road at night expecting an apparition in white to appear. What it was like to come so close to saying ""Bloody Mary"" to the mirror and then passing out. There is a likability to this show that can't be ignored, and there's even some great moments with the two main characters Sam and Dean (played quite well by Padalecki and Ackles) but it is that nostalgic feeling above all that brings me back each week.",2005
5,Seasons 1-5 of 'Supernatural' were brilliant.,2015
7,"What the F*** is going on with this show?? This show isn't rolling downhill anymore, it's being sucked into a void of crap, i'm at the point where i just skip to the end of the episodes just to get the info i need to understand the actual plot of the season. If you had asked me 3-4 years ago about this show, i would rate it nr. 5- 6 on my top 10 list, but now, i'm now i don't even know why i watch it. Season 1-5 was good, original, got me exited and made me wanna watch more, but now you can tell the show is reaching so far and trying everything to fill out the seasons, every bit of stuff they can find, they will put it in. Bringing in old characters, old monsters, new cursed objects that kills people or make other people kill people.. yes i just watched the one with the masks, and i tormented myself into watching all of it, in case there was info i needed for the next ones. I'm sorry if i seem like a party-pooper, but when they bring in the darkness, and turns Crowley into a dad, then it's clear that they are really running out of stuff to use. If you are going to try this show out, then watch season 1-5, that's the good stuff, what comes after is starting downhill slowly, slow enough for you not too notice at first. But stop after season 10, there is no good reason to continue, pretend it's over, and have a small happy memory of the show. good luck.",2015
10,I am completely in love with this show.,2005
7,"I am a very big fan of Supernatural. I started watching it one year ago, and there were times where I would watch an entire season in day or two. The topic is obviously supernatural, and it all starts with two brothers trying to find out what killed their mother. First 5 seasons are brilliant. It was scary like it should be considering this is a horror series, it had suspense, the plot was very interesting and it was really a show I loved. It had a lot of typical monsters like ghosts, demons, angels and vampires, but it also had some legendary monsters from mythology and folklore like Bloody Mary. Also, the comedy in the show was brilliant. But after five excellent seasons, I feel like the show has been going downhill. There were some funny episodes, but my problem with this show is that it has lost all the scary suspense it has had. I am still watching it though, because I do want some closure to all of this. So, if you are new to this and haven't seen it, take a look. You won't be sorry, and who knows? Maybe you will even like the seasons 6- 10 more than I do.",2015
10,"This is the kind of show that everybody has been waiting for! I have been watching this show since the very first episode and I have noticed that all this reality s*** out now is getting to be more and more obnoxious but it's nice to know that a show like this is still running! The horror and suspense actually gets to me, in a good way of course. You would not expect to become nervous while watching a TV show, but this one knows how to start suspense and end suspense within an hour and make it absolutely amazing. The special effects are always fantastic and the script always has me on the floor laughing, well not literally. Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki are one of the best teams I've seen in a very long time! They play off each other very nicely and not to mention the fact that they are both extremely attractive. Although if you are thinking about starting to watch this show now, I'd take the time to check out or even purchase the first 3 seasons, the show is so much better watching it from the beginning as compared to starting it mid 4th season, as with most shows.",2008
10,"It's a mini horror movie every week. Supernatural brings American urban legends into your home each episode. All those stories you told around the campfire as a child come to life in this explosive TV show. From the exceptional writing to the awesome soundtrack, this TV show is a step above the rest. I love seeing the dynamic between the brothers, Sam and Dean. It seems that no matter what has happened in the past, family is family. I imagine this show is a production nightmare. There are so many great special effects, it's like being at your local cinema. And you can't forget that car. A '67 Impala that the brothers travel the country in. With the classic rock tunes blaring on the cassette player and the roar of the engine, this car is hot! Overall, I think Supernatural is one of the best shows on TV. My only concern is them running out of good material. I mean there are only so many urban legends. However, I've heard they've got the first 3 seasons pretty much mapped out, so at least we can have a few good years, right.",2006
9,"This show is absolutely wonderful! It's one of the few shows I've really gotten into. The actors and guest stars are wonderful at what they do, and this show proves it. The episodes have scared me more than most movies have. Dean and Sam are an exact portray of brothers, sticking together through thick and thin, being there for each other when one is in trouble, and fighting of course. It's truly one of my favorite shows, and everything about it is amazing. The guest stars they choose are very good and the story lines are well-acted out. The scene is really terrifying as well. They make this show look so good, I never want to stop watching! I love it!",2006
10,"SUPERNATURAL is a fantastic show that gives fans thrills and chills every episode, and it also delivers an interesting story line that captures the viewer and hooks them for the next episode. The main characters, Dean and Sam Winchester, are as different as night and day but they are united by family loyalty and the goal of vanquishing the demon that murdered their mom. They are joined by their dad, a man who had devoted his life to killing demons and searching for the killer of his wife and putting an end once and for all to the horrors that plague mankind.",2006
10,"I have been a fan of 'Supernatural' for 5 years now and the series is still as awesome as it first started. It is about two brothers, Sam Winchester and Dean Winchester's journey to find their father in the first season. From there it goes through fighting with the 'yellow-eyed demon' to Dean going to hell in the third season and then my most favourite season 4 when Castiel enters. Castiel passes through every demon shackle spell and drawings in the whole building and comes to Dean to say 'I am Castiel, I am an Angel of the Lord'. You wouldn't believe the chills that gave me, the hair on my skin stood up. The 5th season is about the impending Apocalypse, the battle between good and evil with Earth as their war field. The atmosphere this show has is downright chilling and it compels the viewer to get hooked.",2010
5,"What started out as an amazing, well written story and funny/cool characters is slowing going worse and worse. I personally loved the first 3 seasons, but after that it just started to get repetitive. For me it's starting to get to the point where I barely can bother watching it anymore. There's just too much unneeded drama, stupid plot-twists, and boring story. Angles and demons were interesting for that one season but now they're pushing 9th and its still about them. What happened to all the vampires, ghouls, ghosts, and other creatures? Why can't they go back to basics, at least a little more often than now. I can't stand the demon- angle fight anymore.",2013
10,"A great show that makes up for the loss of a number of greats. The TV seemed incredibly dull following the loss of x-files, Buffy, angel and dark angel.

The two brothers are fantastically casted to compliment each other and are a fantastic on screen pair. i would highly recommend this on the edge of your seat TV show if you have a love for the supernatural or even if you just like to watch Jared and Jenssen do there thing on screen!",2006

I'm not really a fan of film reviewers as their job involves pretending that there is an objective standard that governs how much everyone will enjoy a film (well, some of them are smart enough not to dress their opinion as anything else).

1,"Well just came out of the movie and uh... I HATED it!!! This Crap definitely avoids everything that makes the books so funny and beautiful to read. The actors are so incredibly bad, I have no words for it. After a mere good start the plot goes from bad to worse. The animations of the book itself were much better even in the 1981 TV series (which has a lot of bad SE but is much more on the hook of the book than this new bullshit). there are so many lost opportunities e.g. right at the beginning where Ford gives the workers some beer to stop them destroying Arthur's house instead of convincing the head worker to lay down in the mud instead of Arthur. All the important things were not really explained (e.g. the need of a towel - they just say you need one but are quiet about the ""why"") Before seeing it I thought that it's impossible to shorten the plot to a 109 minutes and unfortunately I was right. too bad and too sad... I really do hope they will NEVER do a sequel to this. The end credits start with ""to douglas"". I think if he wouldn't have already been dead he would surely die after watching what they made out of his masterpiece.",2005

1,"I saw this flick opening night with some friends who are big fans of the book. I have not read the book, but have only heard good things. I was hoping this film would capture the brilliance of Adams' work as it's been shared with me. Unfortunately, the film failed to deliver. This flick really has no plot. Most of the film's events come as complete surprises; I suppose that randomness was supposed to add to the *wackiness* of the whole experience. It quickly became nauseating. In this case, I wish I'd watched ANY of the advertised films in the trailers instead of the feature film. That's a HUGE claim: ""The Adventures of Shark Boy and Lava Girl"" was in there .. {shudder}.",2005

1,"well its been a long wait and all for nothing, this is everything the film should not be, badly made, loud and bombastic, and mostly wrongly cast, freeman is just not right, rickmans voice is good but not in a body of a four foot round robot, also he and everyone else speaks to fast, that's one of the major problems is the pace is too fast. there is no sense of story/characters/involvement. i do not believe adams would have approved he held out all his life, ever wonder why. the director has no idea of how to construct a movie. the invented bit of trillion getting captured by the vogons is a complete waste of time. the opening song supposedly sung by the dolphins has to be one of the worst songs written. and the ending is beyond belied. there are one or two decent bits but they are far outweighed by the overall badness and misconception of this sorry enterprise",2005
1,"As a kid in the early 80's I enjoyed Douglas Adam's books immensely, & as any school kid did at the time learned whole passages of THHGTTG verbatim. If only there had been an end of year exam I may have gone on to university. Fast forward several years (or decades - I don't remember) and I have just walked out of the British premiere of the new movie in Leeds (a first for me). Lacking any of the subtlety of Adam's humor that made the radio shows and book so popular in the 80's and acted as badly, if not worse than the TV series, this movie is a horror. It is obvious that the producers have never made a movie before; the plot is a mess the whole thing chops around all over the place with bits thrown in for no apparent reason like the Humma Kavula & Questular Rontok characters. This movie is lazy, sloppy, badly shot, and grainy - looks like it was shot on digicam. I kept waiting for the film to settle down and find its rhythm however it never did, nor did it look like it was going to when I walked out whilst Arthur & Trillian were taking a shower. I cannot really think who could have pulled off a movie of HHG maybe Terry Gilliam, The only saving grace is a cameo by the original Marvin from the BBC series. Truly awful. I don't know why I bother Oh my God - Funny, how just when you think life can't possibly get any worse it suddenly does.",2005
7,"I've just come back from seeing this film and I have to say I'm in two minds about it. Having grown up with the TV series, the radio series, and the books (in that order), I have certain preconceptions and expectations about Hitchhiker's that this film didn't always deliver.",2005
2,"Firstly, if you're an Adams fan, don't, please don't waste your money on this travesty, for it is a savaging of Adams' work which must have him spinning in his grave like a catherine wheel. I was (un)fortunate enough to have free tickets to a preview screening last night, and I had honestly been looking forwards to it, and went with an open mind. Five minutes into the film, my mind was beginning to shut down, from sheer despair.",2005
5,"Last night I was at the world premiere of the new HitchHikers Guide to the Galaxy film, in Leicester Square, courtesy of the BBC's H2G2 competition. Front seat rows, bang in the centre. Nice, though a recipe for neck ache that even the free towel on the back of the seat couldn't prevent I don't have the privilege of coming to HHGG with a fresh view, and it's always going to be difficult to compete against three hugely successful previous formats of the same work. But if I did, then I suspect I might have left the theatre wondering what all the fuss was about. As it was, I can see that the film was its own beast, though I was left flat by the parts that most closely mimic the TV series, partly because the jokes are now 25 years old, and well known to me, but mainly because they didn't do them as well as other versions.",2005
8,"It is wonderfully refreshing to see an intelligent adaptation of a well-loved book which manages to be innovative and highly entertaining. I saw the film last week, and after having seen the television adaptation as a child I did not have my fond memories shattered. The eccentricity of the story and characters have remained intact, and the Monty Pythonesque humour has been enhanced with even more surreal flights of fancy. Although funded by the US, this is a very British film and those who are fans of the new Dr Who, League of Gentleman and Little Britain are well catered for here. The film will not appeal to everyone, but those who love the book and intelligent, original comedy will have a fantastic time.",2005
8,"This is a good and faithful recreation of Adams' brilliantly sketchy radio series. Not surprising as Adams wrote the screenplay and was on the verge of having his dream realised when he suffered a fatal heart attack. A fitting credit at the end of the film ""For Douglas"" serves as a gentle reminder of the genius we have all lost. As for the film, many of the original and wonderful lines thankfully remain and the plot is largely unchanged. There's a new character or two written in for the film by Adams himself and they add to the overall story. John Malkovich is great albeit very briefly as religious leader Humma Kavula. Sam Rockwell, Mos Def and Martin Freeman all carry off their characters with wit and style whilst I felt Zooey Deschanel looked a little out of her depth. At times her dialogue seemed to get lost and her character seemed weaker than Sandra Dickinson's interpretation in the radio and TV series. Bill Nighy marries his own idiosyncrasies into the character of Slartibartfast seamlessly. Simon Jones makes a welcome cameo appearance as a holographic warning system. Stephen Fry steps well into the shoes vacated by Peter Jones as the ""Guides"" voice and you feel as if you are in safe hands. The ""Guides"" animated sequences are wonderfully reminiscent of Saul Bellow and though simple they are hilarious. For a feature directorial debut Garth Jennings does a grand job. I was half expecting the pop video influence to be apparent, but thankfully it wasn't. Lastly but not leastly a special mention has to go out to Jim Henson's creature workshop, this is probably the best work they have ever done in a feature, and that's saying a lot, given their success.",2005

10,"Gandhi said, ""An eye for an eye only makes the whole world blind."" What distinguishes justice from vengeance? This echoes throughout Steven Spielberg's ""Munich"". ""Munich"" is powerful and perhaps Spielberg's most compelling and thought provoking work. He weaves a tapestry of political and social threads focusing on terrorism and the cost of violence. ""Munich"" is truly amazing in balancing linear storytelling and horrific acts of violence, demonstrating the impact of the aftermath. Spielberg's ""Munich"" seen through the eyes of Eric Bana's Avner is a powerful allegory that even in the most just and noble fights against terror we eventually become that which we despise. ""Munich"" really serves as a reminder. Mossad team leader Avner played by Eric Bana is absolutely riveting as the man who begins this righteous cause only to find that the cost is his soul. Anver asks, ""When does it ever end?"" ",2006
10,"I am not a big Spielberg fan, and find he often goes for cheap emotional manipulation in his films, especially his endings. I was there fore amazed at the unflinching control he exercised in Munich, his utter unwillingness to flinch at complexities, his ability to dissect the ideological and moral sureties of all sides within the natural rhythms of the thriller genre. There is so much to praise in this film, because it is utterly seamless film-making with a keen eye for every little detail that never reveals the intense precision behind its construction.",2006
8,"Munich may just be Spielberg's greatest accomplishment ever and it isn't a sweeping epic like you'd expect, but a patient psychological thriller that sneaks up on you and takes you and shakes you. It not shy away from blood, politics or nudity in its portrayal of events and this makes it extremely intense, absorbing and occasionally very violent. ",2006
9,"'Munich' is, on the whole, a straight forward hit-man movie. The assignments are handed out; the team is assembled, each with their own specialty; and they travel about Europe plotting and carrying out their hits. We have the inevitable paranoia, the double agents and suspicious loyalties. So far, so familiar. Only 'Munich' is wrapped in the thin veneer of 'history' and 'fact', and mob bosses and corporate espionage is replaced with Middle Eastern politics and Israeli-Arab relations. I mention this because the politics of 'Munich' are really nothing more than a topical plot devise, used the same way as cold-war relations and soviet villainy was used thirty years ago.",2006
8,"Steven Spielberg has absolutely everything at his disposal, he can make an epic in no time at all. But, even he must know that films, most films have a soul and that can't be rushed. Why the need to rush this film into screens? For Oscar consideration? If there was a film that needed nurturing and thought was this one. The length is a flaw in itself. It makes it appear self indulgent and, quite frankly,annoying. If one could, and one should, put that aside, ""Munich"" is a remarkable experience. Tony Kushner and Eric Roth deal with people in all its complexity - a welcome new detail in a Spielberg film - and that gives ""Munich"" its most powerful aspect. Eric Bana is extraordinary and the humanity of his gaze is confusing and recognizable at the same time. His crying at hearing his child's voice over the phone is as real as his hardness when he massacres his targets. The controversy raising after the first public screenings seems pre-fabricated by a marketing machine. The questioning of Bana's character and the appalling nature of revenge can't be controversial it's at the base of human nature. To call Spielberg ""no friend of Israel"" is as absurd as it is suspicious. No, this movie is a thriller, based on actual events, directed by the greatest craftsman of the last 30 years in a record amount of time. Go see it.",2005

10,"What should have been an uneventful Olympics in Munich, 1972, became the bloodshed that unfolded like a Moebius strip and unleashed even more blood unto the world. On September 5, 1972, eight Palestinian terrorists killed two Israeli athletes, kidnapped nine more, and asked for safe passage out of Germany and the subsequent liberation of Arab prisoners in Israeli and German prisons. Once at the airport they encountered resistance from the German authorities, and in a scuffle, all of the other nine hostages were killed.",2006
10,"Reading over the comments and message board postings for Munich on this site, I get the impression that at least 75% of the people here are less interested in discussing the film and its message than the Arab-Israeli conflict in general. I've read a lot of baseless criticisms, and I honestly think that the whole point went over most of these people's heads. The ones who have actually seen the movie, that is.",2005
10,"I don't think the ""perfect"" movie has been made yet. I don't know that a masterpiece is necessarily perfect, so, viewers will undoubtedly find faults in this movie, some of which have already been expressed in the comment section. But masterpiece or not, I really liked this movie. It told a particular side of the story and told it well. And if you witnessed any of the tragedy of Munich in the summer of 1972, you feel a connection to the events portrayed in this movie. We, the audience, become a member of the hit squad able to empathize with the angst in becoming assassins with consciences, as collateral damage does matter. But the trouble with trying to maintain a conscience is that each notch on the belt is another slash of your humanity ripped from your soul. You squirm from living in the uncertainty of trusting people you are suspicious of in order to fulfill your mission. You nervously plan the pathway to the next target. You seethe with the frenzy of the kill. You perpetually twitch in the paranoia of becoming the hunted, ""sleeping"" with one eye open and a finger on the trigger. In the beginning you are swept away by your sense of duty to God and country above all else. In the end you are cynical, angry and afraid about what you have done and what you have become.",2005
8,"It is not so frequent to find a film that is intriguing Spielberg's ""Munich"" is beyond intrigue to the point to do ruinous damage It's a dramatic thriller that disarms you and leaves you shocked It really makes you question the nature of national retaliation, and gives you something to think about and discuss ",2006

1,"I lived in Munich in 1972, so I wanted to see this movie. I understand that the movie is only loosely based on actual events and the rest is based on a fictional book. I understand that Spielberg wanted to give us a message that violence against violence will create more violence.",2006
10,"If you ask me who was the most talented director working in film today, I'd hesitate for a while. Then I'd look at you and say, ""Probably Steven Spielberg'. A lot of film directors in Hollywoodwho are well-known are overrated (Oliver Stone, Sofia Coppola, Anthony Minghella, etc), but one that is not overrated at all is Spielberg. The man is obviously a cinematic genius who thrilled and enthralled us with his grim but unimaginably powerful WWII epic 'Saving Private Ryan', his still-frightening 'Jaws', his severely underrated 'Amistad' and of course, his heart-breaking masterpiece that still remains one of the twenty best films of all time 'Schindler's List'. I can't even begin to describe to you how jazzed I was about the controversial vengeance drama 'Munich', which was Spielberg's first Oscar-contending movie in seven years. After viewing it I have to say I was a bit let down, but I still got what I predicted I'd get going into the theater -- the best film of 2005. Spielberg challenges our beliefs on justice with his intense but painfully realistic bone-chilling masterpiece. You have to see this movie.",2006
1,"I found this film to be an attempt to intellectualise revenge, and the role of one man within the cogs of the vengeful machine (might he just crack up, whaddyathink?!). Kill Bill was much the same, but that at least had panache and great direction!! If Munich is 'based on true events' as it says, then it needs to do a whole lot more justice to BOTH sides of this particular tale. It seems to me to be a film which, although it fails to thoroughly glorify Mossad, it certainly allows them a fair share of understanding. Meanwhile, the Palestinians are merely 'terrorists' - very simplistic. ",2006
8,"Just because this film has been attacked by pols and shills, here's my 2 cents. Spielberg manages to set the agenda, and sets it correctly. It is indeed about the antecedents to 9/11, and bravo to Spielberg for taking it on, but not somewhere in Afghanistan, but at its genesis, the squalor of Palestine. ",2006
1,"Americans helped get terrorists over the fence? This is so irresponsible. It's the first of many contrived scenes.  One Jewish athlete holds off eight terrorists at his door so Spielberg can set up tension? He didn't look like the 300 pound gorilla that was historically at that door.  We're supposed to believe that the terrorists were watching the news. The news was US and in1972 there was no Cable, no satellite. What news were they watching? German? We're supposed to believe that the Germans actually broadcast vital sniper positions to the terrorists? Eric Bana's character, Avner, is told he may have to leave Israel for years to finish his mission. Why did Avner move his family to NewYork? There was no good reason except to get his World Trade Center shot.  Jews were not mad at Golda Meir for not negotiating with the terrorists. It's preposterous to even make that claim in the film. Why put American money in a box? Wouldn't they use Deutsch Marks? He was in Germany. In 1972, there was no way to spend US dollars in Europe  Why 6 boxes? Couldn't the money fit in one? Why is his German friend at the lunch meeting where he is going to ask for the names of the people responsible for Munich? Dialogue was so stupid, ""If you tell anyone . . . I don't know what I'll do.""  Why in the first killing of the terrorists do they look nervous? Wasn't Avner Mossad? He was also a former bodyguard to the prime minister. Now he looks like a scared school boy. What?  No one heard those shots? I've been to Europe; those high arches would have echoed that sound for miles.  Why are they celebrating or rejoicing their killing? These are trained Mossad agents. No?  Why is Avner haunted by the Munich games and have these visions? He wasn't there.  Why would an affluent Parisian Arab like Mohammad Hamshari not have a phone at his desk?  That whole scene with the girl coming back is not only a cheap plot device to pull at our heart strings, it also is totally unrealistic and messed up. If you look closely, it's so messed up they had to drive the car backwards to arrive back in front of the house, otherwise they would have been spotted by Ciaran Hines. I am supposed to believe that the bomb expert, Robert, had to remove two pieces of tape and give Ciaran Hines enough time to run to the car and stop him? Wouldn't he have the key ready to go?  He returns to Israel for his child's birth. Why can't he go home? Obviously, he did. So, what's the drama? Again, why make his wife leave?  His Dad was a war hero, but in prison for his birth? What's going on?  When they have the scene with the hotel bomb, why does he have to be in the next room? The bed spring bomb device tells you when the victim has lied down?  Why does the Arab say he looks like a Swede? Don't Swedes have blond hair and blue eyes? Did I miss a joke?  Bad enough he is in the hotel room next to the bomb, why would he switch off the lamp so close to the door. Wouldn't a trained Mossad agent take precautions?  Why is the only damage to the Couple next door the woman's eyes? How did that happen?  What's up with Louis and Papa? They say they don't work with governments. Who else would want names of the people responsible for the Munich Massacre? Rich Americans? Why? This is RIDICULOUS!!  Why does he want to go to Beirut? Why are they not allowed to go to Arab countries? In Beirut, in the dress in drag scene o Why does everyone get shot in sequence o This scene is full of problems. Why do all these Mossad agents run down stairs in a single file? Why don't any of the Arabs shoot these guys as they are running down the stairs in a single file line?  Why would Louis have the PLO and Avner's team shack up in the same safe house?  Why do they yell their terrorist affiliation to strangers? Why speak English and then German?  Language is all messed up.  Avner's conversation with the PLO guy was terrible. In Greece, why does Hans bring an extra grenade, especially after Robert tells them that they are all old and should be thrown away? Robert says, ""I am trained to dismantle bombs, not to make them."" THINK ABOUT THIS!!! HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY DISMANTLE A BOMB AND NOT KNOW HO TO MAKE ONE! Why in the middle of the film are all these trained Mossad agents now questioning what they are doing?  Am I the only one that found a Mossad agent sniffing the air for the scent to Carl's door as absolutely ridiculous? He says ""I saw her first,"" walks away, and then, I guess his Mossad secret agent senses kick in, and he comes back to the door. Why did they use Zip air pump guns to kill the Dutch woman? Why not sue guns? o Also, why is it when they're screwing and loading their zip guns, instead of pulling the gun out of the drawer and shoot them, she instead flashes her right breast. This whole scene is ridiculous  Why after Hans is missing do we find him sitting on a park bench? How did we get there?  The rest of the film descends into total chaos with him going crazy, and by this point, I just can't believe this film got a nod for best picture.",2006

1,"Having been instructed to sit down and view this film by one of its admirers I prepared myself to be told a good story about an historical event. As the movie unreeled, however, I found I was treated to a shameful falsification of history and what looked more like a propaganda tool for the Israeli government than a true story.",2010
9,"This movie was just incredible! I didn't know if I would like it, but I'm so grateful that I saw it! It was intense and so filled with emotion. You have to be in the mood for something deep, it's definitely not a light movie. It was like a documentary, with all the news clips and so on. We always see things on the news about the fighting and the hatred, but this movie shows us a glimpse of the actual people who are affected and their emotions. It's not a typical Hollywood movie, at ALL. I didn't even know that it was a Spielberg movie until the very end, and I'm glad I didn't know. It was just such a ""real"" movie, not fake or dramatic or forced. It was like you were watching a real man going through real experiences, and you never feel like you're taking sides, you just get lost in the hopelessness of it all. Although you feel like the situation is hopeless, you don't feel like the movie was a waste of time, because this is a real conflict in the world, and you just feel a little more informed, and thankful for that. The movie was so interesting and deep, I hope that everyone will go see it.",2006
7,"Munich is getting extremely mixed reviews -- from a coronation by Roger Ebert to a trashing from Anthony Lane. My response is somewhere between the two. As a thriller, it is a little predictable for three hours, I accept that. Nevertheless, I've rarely shared a character's (Bana's character's) sense of being hunted before in a movie. Yes, it's a little heavy hitting on the sermonic/moralising side -- but it is Spielberg, and you expect a little didactic direction there. The last scene, with the appearance of the World Trade Center (it's 1972) hammers the 9/11 commentary in a little too much for my liking. For minutes leading up to it, it was obvious that the two characters would end their dialogue with the twin towers in view. I was sitting in the theatre thinking, okay, pan a little more to the right, bring them in ... that's it ... there you go! And then there's the much discussed final sex scene between bana's character and his wife. inter-cut with images of the Munich killings. I interpreted this to be a comment on the endless cycle of violeve: go forth and multiply, the biblical Israel is told, and with every new child is born another subject of generational hatred and the need for vengeance. Others have interpreted this scene more ""redemptively"" -- new life entering the world, the morning after the darkest night, etc. Overall, it's a good, possibly important, film which misses some opportunities for subtlety and implied comment. Tony Kushner's role seems to have been to polish -- and he had literally only weeks to do that. An original screenplay from Kushner would have improved this considerably. That's not to give the movie a slating: i'd recommend it to anyone, and it has to be considered for some awards. The inevitable controversy in the U.S. about anti-semitism in the film is simply beyond stupid and beyond contempt.",2005
8,"If you like suspense and twists, then Medium is your show to watch. I have enjoyed watching the show and enjoyed all the characters but I must admit that Patricia Arquette did get on my nerves at times while in character and although she was the star of the show, she was my least favorite character on it.",2012
10,"Many reasons could be said about this show and why i think its a 10 of 10. One reason is the smart script. I cant understand how some people can compare this show to Ghost Whisperer. The characters feels real and every show is scary, smart and ""funny"". ",2011
10,"As far as the Sci-fi channel goes, excluding Heroes, this is the best show they have (cue the BBC hi-jack). I saw the beginning of a few episodes late at night but was properly introduced to this by my brother and his girlfriend. After spending an entire half term watching Medium catch-up week on Sci-fi it became my favourite TV show (it was only just surpassed by Heroes later on). Though it does seem repetitive (watching Allison wake up after a nightmare in almost every episode) I never feel like watching the same thing re-hashed. Patricia Arquette is wonderful and the relationship between Allison and her husband Joe is probably the greatest thing about the whole series. Sofia Vassilieva and Maria Lark are the least nauseating child actors I have seen and they never fail to make me laugh.",2007
5,"Most episodes of this show can be summed up by the following: Allison has a vision that relates to a crime that has occurred or is about to occur, her husband/boss/co-worker/etc doubt her conclusions and Allison nags them until it is somehow proved that she is correct and they, being the dumb men that are, have been wrong all along.",2007
10,"It's been more than ten years since the first episode of 'Medium' aired. It was one of my favorite shows - a mixture of horror, crime, and warm family drama.

9,"I happened to find the list for the top rated TV shows on this site and I am disturbed that ""Medium"" is # 759? I have no argument with the #1 choice ""Breaking Bad"". Absolutely loved it, from there it gets confusing. The massive amount of shows rated above Medium is incredible, some of them are horrendous. I don't know how this list is created but if quality were a criteria then several hundred of these would be eliminated from consideration. Medium was excellent, I fell in love with the family in this show. The acting was excellent, to the point of feeling like I was part of it, Patricia Arquette won an Emmy award for her performance. I feel that other actors could have been considered as well. Joe (Jake Weber) was an excellent father/husband, the kids were also quit believable. I found myself being more interested in the family than the actual premise of the show. That is not to say that there was anything wrong with the storyline, the remaining cast were quite believable in their roles as well. Each show started with a mystery, usually through Alison's premonitions which drew you into the story from the very beginning. It's rare to find a show running 7 years where there aren't some bad episodes. I can't recall one that I didn't enjoy. Of course some were better than others but every one left me in anticipation of the next. Fortunately through the magic of Netflix I didn't have to wait. The problem I had was turning the TV off. In my opinion this was the best family dynamic I have personally seen on TV. I'll have to admit I'm not much of a TV series fan but that's because most of them are just not good enough to captivate me like this show did. I was genuinely disappointed when the show ended. That is very rare for me, usually by the time a show has been canceled I've grown tired of it anyway. Breaking Bad and Dexter may be the only other shows I can think of where I wanted more. Back to this rating #759...........absolutely ridiculous. If you haven't seen this show I highly recommend it.",2015
9,"Before we talk about the show, let's talk about the talent. Glen Gordon Caron has been on the other side of the camera for a very long time, with a pedigree that includes, oh, for example, discovering Bruce Willis. And that's just for starters. Similarly, Arquette had a long and fairly impressive run in features, not always the A-roles, perhaps, but consistent nonetheless. Bringing these two together in 2005 was a match full of promise and ultimately the promise was kept. Next, the stories. It may be because the premise was based on a real person that the week-to-week plots were entirely consistent with the way real intuitives actually operate in the real world. Ordinarily Hollywood simply cannot resist the temptation to take it up a notch, especially from season to season. Had the plot arcs followed the usual Tinseltown roadmap, the Alison character played by Arquette would be getting predictive dreams in Season 1 and raising the dead by Season 6. But the producer showed restraint, and I believe that is part of the reason for the success of this show. I have seen every episode, and I recall that by the time the last season rolled around, they were getting just a tad frisky -- Alison may have a fatal illness, Alison's ability may be illegal in court; Alison tries to help Joe's business with her gift -- but a 6 year run is nothing to sneeze at. It was consistent, it was solid, it was entertaining. In TV, that's about as good as it gets.",2013

8,"As a more than passing fan of the Zorro movies that span the decades, I had been waiting since 1998 for a sequel to Martin Campbell's 'Mask of Zorro.' That movie took much (though not everything) of the best of the various Zorro films, serials, and series and then stole from other sources (such as Dumas 'Monte Cristo', etc) to concoct a sexy, swashbuckling action adventure that had great pacing and strengths, with high production values and actors. Mr. Campbell and those high standards at last return to the story begun, and we now follow our heroes and their son as California fights to join a struggling Union. Zorro's character is not quite so impulsive and cool as he once was, but simply comfortable and ultra-capable, while his wife Elena complains that the man behind the mask knows not who their son is growing up to be. None of these character 'upgrades' felt wrong to me; it was natural extensions of them from the first film, despite how adventurous Elena claims to still be (and for the most part isn't), but it does make the first act of this movie a bit tiresome after the initial (awesome) action sequence. This time, though, as the story and its many plot-points begin to move, the writers borrow heavily from Hitchcock to keep things interesting. It doesn't always work, as there's a lot going on but never QUITE coming perfectly, cohesively together, but ultimately it makes sense and spins a good yarn for the fighting to take over. Meanwhile the stunt coordinators take what has already been done in the best Zorro flicks and then go wild with it, giving us stunts and action of old-school-cool caliber, such as stage-coaches, leaps and horses jumping on to explosive-laden locomotives. Unfortunately there is not quite enough action, and while I do like the over-all story - with its subtle bits of murk and dirty grays underneath the battle of white and black hats - it doesn't actually pace perfectly, giving us bickering Vega family exploits and Zorro failures for a rather large portion of the picture. The sword fights are fewer and more far-between than I would have liked, sometimes degrading to fisticuffs instead of proper dicing, but then the explosions almost make up for it all. The humor is a bit silly, provided mostly by the horse(!!) and the sometimes-annoying kid, but the audience ate it up. The villains are good, if never entirely fleshed out, and the themes are handled well. It's the lag caused by the idea (which I never understood) that 'once a couple gets together they're not interesting anymore' that slows things. Regardless of my small issues, the movie DOES deliver as a Zorro film, (with a good ending, for certain) and while it doesn't completely live up to its predecessor, it is a worthy sequel - just not entirely the direction I would have gone.",2005
5,"Antonio Banderas is back under the mask of Zorro, the 19th Century swashbuckler who must face another dangerous mission, although he promised his wife Elena (Catherine Zeta-Jones) that he'd give up his life of adventure for a quiet family life as Alejandro de la Vega. But those who opposed California becoming a state in the Union are planning a new threat that might change their plans.",2005
9,"I am a mom of 5 children, so when I get a night out to see a movie I don't want to see a dud. When It is a date with your husband it is even tougher. It can't be too much of a chic flick and I don't want to see something too violent. It isn't easy to find a movie with some action (Dad) some romance (Mom) and some comedy (both). This movie did it. Now I am not saying it should get some academy award but I sure wish there were more movies like this. It was suspenseful without being gory. It was romantic and sexy without the sex (women love that). The addition of the child added a parent component that we liked. It really could be considered as a family movie for older children. I can't specifically recall any profanity (that doesn't mean there wasn't).This movie was definitely not a waste of a babysitter. It was also nice and long for those of us with a longer attention span who want a more developed plot. The story was interesting and entertaining and funny (if you catch it).",2005

10,I was looking forward to this movie for months and personally I loved it. I laughed and cheered throughout the movie. If you want a Zorro adventure/action flick you will get it. Catharine Zeta-Jones role is enhanced and she gets to be more than a pretty face. I loved Elena's role as Zorro's partner as well as wife. The mini-me Zorro son was fine with me also and got lots of laughs from the audience. Good villains and great scenery from San Luis Potosi in Mexico. Good stunts especially with the horse. While some of the plot may seem unbelievable you must suspend belief and just sit back for a good time. The audience applauded at the end. Nice music too!,2005
1,"This is without doubt one of the most awful piles of crap I have had the misfortune to watch in many years. Where to start? We start off with a 2 dimensional baddie trying to scupper a democratic vote. Why?, who is going to gain from this? - who cares? - no explanation is given. The accession of California into the union is a victory for democracy unless of course you are a native American but I wouldn't expect such an ideologically idiotic film to even 'tip its hat' in that direction.",2006
1,"The people who wrote this should re-read their American history: they have butchered it. It is so bad, the movie makes no sense. They have combined Civil War (1861-1865) with California becoming a state--that never happened. California was a state way before the Civil War was a reality. They even have the wrong American flag when they signed the paper making California a state. There are so many mistakes that make this movie a total complete fiasco. Maybe the makers of the movie should have made this movie an 'alternate history' movie; even that would not save this movie. This movie was just horrible. As a movie, this tries to make Zorro a legend. He and his wife undergo a divorce and here reality takes a complete leap into unbelievability. Divorce did not exist back then as it does today. Divorced, his wife works for the Pinkertons as an undercover agent for the U.S. government. In reality, Pinkerton was a private detective agency and did not work for the U.S. government at this time; it only worked for the U.S. about 12 years later during the Civil War. Zorro exposes the nefarious plot, saves the day, and helps California to become a state. The railroad was not as big back then, and not big at all until after the Civil War when the Continental railroad system was made in the 1870's. Even using the Henry rifle in California was wrong. The stunts do not save this mess; even Antonio and Catherine were not able to save it. The original 'Mask of Zorro' was better than this mess.",2006
1,This has to be one of the worst movies of all time and you are wasting your money to go see it like I did. There was one good thing about the movie was the fact that they have one of the hottest actresses ever playing one of the lead roles which makes it a 1/10 instead of a 0/10.,2005

Every scene is so clichéd that it took me 4 nights to finish this movie, I watched in parts of 20-30 minutes... I couldn't take it longer than that. Highly predictable, uninspiring storyline, lock stock and barrel stereotype characters, poor dialog, over the top laughable stunt scenes...I could go on forever, but I can't waste more time with this movie. A total back flip from the first part. The one thing this movie gets a thumbs up in is putting you to sleep if you have a case of insomnia (it helped me 3 times).",2006

While some may enjoy the idea of a 10 year old boy in fight sequences, I thought it was silly. The movie's attempt at comedy came across as just plain goofy. There was just enough violence to ruin the movie for younger children (one child in the theater started crying). Anthony Hopkins lent the lat movie a touch of class that is lacking in this film. There may indeed be enough chemistry between the stars to warrant another movie, but the story and dialog made it impossible for me to enjoy to enjoy this film.",2005
10,"The Legend of Zorro is as perfect as a sequel can possibly be. Well-balanced in action and humor, it brought back everything I loved about the first one in spades. Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones return to their characters in top form, with a storyline that maintains the screw-tightening suspense that a good cliffhanger should offer. Visually, the film is beautiful. The producers revisited the Mexican locales where Mask of Zorro was shot, giving its successor a fresh and vibrant palette of continuity.

Finally, James Horner's phenomenal score kept the fire burning, and left me on an adrenaline high as the closing credits rolled. Zorro rides again!",2005

4,"It started out with promise, but it soon changed into something awkward and inaccurate in a lot of historical facts, which weakened the plot for me. It was also too violent for its PG rating, and deserved a PG-13 rating. California became a state in 1850, which is when this movie is supposed to be... however, they mentioned several times ""the Civil War"" between the states, and how the United States is divided. They also had Confederate soldiers in a couple of scenes. They were ten years ahead of themselves, and also there is a scene when it becomes a state and a man in formal attire signing the official papers looked similar to Lincoln, who didn't become President until 1860. Also it wasn't that easy to get a divorce in 1850, like Elena did. Three months after she kicked her husband out of the house and divorced him, she was engaged to another man, which was highly scandalous, because Catholics didn't remarry at that point without being ex-communicated. It had unbelievable stunts and stupid twists. The plot dragged on for the longest time. So, as you can tell, I really didn't enjoy this movie.",2005
8,"Someone needs to defend ""the legend of Zorro"". I am reading all kinds of reviews which criticize this movie for very minor details, when, in fact, this movie is really just trying to have fun.",2005

1,Zorro finds himself divorced from his love after many years of marriage. His private investigation of his former wives new husband unravels a devious plot.,2005
4,"While fighting for freedom is all well and good, fabricating a ""confederate"" army in 1850 makes the movie seem like it's in a parallel universe. If this were sci-fi that would be OK, but the whole thing was so silly that I couldn't take anything else in the movie very seriously. This was too bad, since the action sequences and the chemistry between Zeta and Banderas was nice. The first Zorro movie also had some historical inaccuracies, but so obscure that it was no big deal. Especially annoying were the typical confederate stooge-types working for the bad guy. I know Hollywood hardly ever gets history right, but rarely does it get history so wrong.",2006
10,"I read here that in the USA this film got an R rating, not PG-13, as ¨director Hallström wanted, only because of something that is suggested is happening under a table. In the Netherlands, where it had it's premiere yesterday, the rating is for over 5 year olds, so that says enough for whom this movie really is. I was at first a little disappointed to find out that this is not a historical movie, but a slapstick comedy, but I loved the settings (Venice and Vicenza,where they made a scene in the famous Teatro Olimpico, which is supposed to be a Venice University in the movie) and the music which is mostly baroque (Vivaldi, Albinoni, Händel, Rameau, Paisiello and a few more) and as a baroque music lover I thoroughly enjoyed the movie just only for the music alone. This must be one of the first-ever costume farce movies, but if you forget all the movies like Shakespeare in love or Pride and Prejudice and take this movie for it's own merits, it is a thoroughly rewarding experience. There was a lot of laughing by the audience and I found myself laughing more than in any movie I remember. It is thoroughly entertaining from first to last minute, but devout Catholics will find it insulting, as it makes fun of the Catholic Church, but it should be quite evident to everyone, also devout catholics, that the story is not to be taken too seriously, so why being bothered by it? The movie can actually be considered as a modern version of an opera buffa. Obviously there is a romantic plot and by all the farce and hilariousness I would say that the romantic element gets snowed under, but, as said, you have to accept this movie for what it is and concentrate on the lavish settings, costumes, music, the fun, and you will want to see it many more times, like me.",2006

8,"CASANOVA is a delightful comedy and farce with a tremendous cast of very talented actors. Heath Ledger is a wonderful and witty CASANOVA, Sienna Miller delivers a delicious performance, and Jeremy Irons, Oliver Platt and Lena Olin all add to the humorous plot and story. This film is fun to watch and see the romp through Venice as CASANOVA jumps from one roof top to another in a very beautifully photographed film.",2005
5,"I just saw Casanova. I read most of the comments here before I went to see it and honestly I was on my way to give up on it. I had fun. I laughed and enjoyed it. One thing though: this is a comedy. If you are in search or a historical, accurate description of the famous Casanova then you are on the wrong path. Some people here said Jeremy Irons was... over-acting? Come on.. give him the merit he deserves as a great actor that he is. He was enjoying his role. I could almost see him laughing on the set after the director shouts out Cut! The only dramatic moment towards the end of the movie seemed to be there just to reinforce the comedy picture after it. Sienna Miller seemed a bit uneasy to me at the beginning with the speech in the University.. I loved the costumes and the settings. It definitely makes you think of buying a ticket to Venice. (Again!) Sensual? 10% Love story? 40% Comedy? The rest. So I say, if you are in the mood for something light, give it a chance and laugh :) And let us agree to disagree, shall we?",2006

Oh, and did I mention humor -- ranging from witty inside jokes to bawdy physical comedy.",2006
9,"If you approach this film looking for history or biography, you will be disappointed. This film is a superbly written farce, enacted by a talented cast of comic actors. The interesting set-up of false identities is further complicated by the addition of two scene-stealers, Oliver Platt and Jeremy Irons. One of the most entertaining scenes in the film is a comic bit involving Oliver Platt as he proudly displays his portrait. Oliver Platt is able to elicit a huge laugh without saying a word and using any broad gesture--just a kind of comic deflation.",2006

8,The life of Giacomo Casanova has been chronicled before. This new take on the rake from Venice is best to enjoy when no comparisons with the real Casanova are made because this is clearly a comedy that has nothing to do with that man who was considered the best lover of all times.,2006
8,"Who cares if the plot adheres to the facts, this is a lighthearted movie not intended to be take seriously! It is a romp around the most beautiful city in the world. The wonderful music carefully selected and very well performed is just a joy, and the actors all camp it up with a wealth of nuance, subtlety and verve. It conveys all the joy of life of this city and this period when noblemen and lesser mortals dressed up and paraded the canal-sides and passages and bridges, masked to preserve identity and equality.",2006

9,"I saw the film earlier this week with friends at a preview. Surprisingly there was not a large crowd. However, that was not the only surprise. The film itself was a surprise. Heath Ledger, not as handsome as usual, was lots of fun, however, as Casanova. Oliver Platt takes some physical risks in this role - if you consider partial nudity a risk for a man Platt's size and shape. All of my friends enjoyed the film. I wasn't expecting the film to be such a romp! It was very successful at being funny! I attribute to Verdi's Don Giovanni. There is even the comic relief of the side kick, Leperello. The plot has a few surprises, and everyone in the film has a good time, except for maybe Jeremy Irons. Lots of fun!",2005
7,"This movie is a blast. If you're a fan of Shakespearian situational comedy (Twelfth Night, Midsummer Night's Dream, etc) then you're in for a treat. And please note that when I refer to Shakespeare, I'm talking about the original plays, not some stupid Kenneth Brannaugh romp.",2006
3,"Easily the worst film I've seen having to do with Giacomo Casanova. First, the casting was absurd. Heath Ledger is a skilled actor in some settings, but he's well out of his depth here, exhibiting absolutely no charisma or worldliness. Lena Olin seems like she just stepped off the set of The O.C., and Jeremy Irons (as a shrill martinet) is clearly embarrassed with his role; I hope he was well-paid. And then spanked.",2006
1,"Good Lord! Cassanova was actually an historic figure who knew many of the illuminati of his time. He was known for a lot of things (including inventing the national lottery in France), not just womanizing--his recollections of which may have been influenced by the advanced age at which he wrote his memoirs. This nasty piece of HollyMush has nothing to do with Cassanova, but sort-of-resembles the Don Juan story--badly. Why even call it Cassanova, then? Lets not subvert real history. (I betcha Cassanova was also ""actually an American"" and all of Italy is ""really California,"" too!) The real Cassanova is actually quite fascinating, and there is an actual story involving passion, a real jailbreak, and life among the debauched upper classes of Europe.",2006
7,"Let's get one thing clear right off the bat: I really, really, really enjoy Lasse Hallstrom's films. The Cider House Rules, The Shipping News (one of my all time favorites), Chocolat, and What's Eating Gilbert Grape are a few that stand out. So I went into this movie expecting the typical Lasse-style film and I wasn't disappointed.",2006
5,"I always thought it would be a good idea to make a comedy about young Casanova  his incredible adventures, love stories, his struggle with church. Casanova was a fascinating historic figure, a soldier, spy, diplomat, writer, adventurer who will also be remembered as the greatest seducer and lover the world had ever seen (if only from his own words). His life and mystery surrounded him has made him an ultimate hero for many novels, plays, and movies. Sadly, not all Casanova's movies are good and Lasse Hallström's comedy belongs to the long list of not successful movies. Sure, it is gorgeous to look at  it is 18th Century Venice after all, and locations, photography, Vivaldi's music, costumes, wigs, make up are first class but beyond all this is just another typical chick flick or romcom with Heath Ledger whose Casanova is not that brilliant and fascinating figure but just a cute guy - no more, no less.",2006
3,I enjoy anything to do with the 18th Century and was bitterly disappointed by this film.One star is for the location shooting - the film really does make the best use of Venice. Another star is for the excellent use of authentic period baroque music. My third star is for the sumptuous use of period costume. As for the rest - a lead balloon.,2006
9,"I have never seen any earlier version of Casanova despite the fame. I had seen Heath Ledger and admired him before, but I always keep an open mind when I see a new movie and never compare an actor to previous roles. This movie was a cream puff, smart and romantic. The plot is done along the lines of old fashioned comedies (see Moliere and Shakespeare), with some cross-dressing of heroines, multiple mistaken identities, witty repartees, slapstick buffoonery of the villain in the play, etc. and a very modern heroine. Delightful! Heath Ledger tries hard to be both swashbuckling, suave and infatuated, a feat in itself; Sienna Miller is adorable as the spirited girl. The other actors are quite entertaining. I think the R rating applies primarily to the first few scenes with Casanova rolling around multiple beds and with a young nun.",2006

9,"I was able to see a sneak preview yesterday with my husband. Though our overall rating of the movie differed we both enjoyed the movie for the most part. I gave it thumbs up and my husband hovered and refused to go one way or another. The bad-It was a little predictable at times and the cg work was really distracting. The Good-The costumes and being filmed on location in Venice was awesome. I thought the acting was great and the overall feel of the movie was fun and exciting but not stuffy. And for a movie that is all about sex they did a great job of keeping it sexy and not over sharing. This is not a mind stimulating movie but a definitely a laugh out loud, eye candy kind. I hope you enjoy it too.",2005
9,"I went to see this movie with my wife and, upon entering the theater, immediately became uncomfortable. There was only one other man at the screening and he was obviously feeling a little out of place as well (although he seemed relieved to see me walk in). I was expecting a teen soap opera, but what the movie delivered was quite different. This movie is more like a modern-times ""Little Women"" or a teen girl version of ""Dead Poets Society"". In other words, it's something that I haven't seen any sign of for decades....an intelligent drama aimed at teenage girls. My response to seeing this movie was similar to how i felt after seeing ""Babe"". I know this is an odd comparison, but both were thoughtful, intelligent movies aimed at a target audience that is usually fed cinematic rubbish. The elements of good film-making are on full display here. Strong acting, sure-handled directing, terrific writing....everything that makes a movie great. If you are a teenage girl or have one in your life, this is an absolutely must-see movie. If you don't, you'll still have a good time.",2005

I had no clue that we were going to see the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants. ",2005

The sex scandals, the drug busts, the foul mouthed youth...I'm only twenty and books like these have me saying ""What's with those kids today"" This book wasn't about that. It was about something really admirable that I would hope to read more of, an honest friendship. Plus it was well written to the point I was *EAGER* to finish it. (A note to those who haven't read...the audio book is one of the best read I've heard in ages and is worse the listen, it has the same actress as the initial trailer announcer) So I became a fan of the book and have been following this movie ever since, and as a fan I have to say that their are elements I would have liked to see in the movie, but the cut (or at least the cut at the screening) was lengthy but appropriate and did the best I think they could have to capture the book.",2005

There should be more movies out there like this, that show that no matter what, your friends truly matter.

For any couple who just feels like seeing a great movie to sit back and to great ready to laugh and cry.

The producers, director, and entire cast should be publicly lynched and have their corpses used to fill in speed bumps. Furthermore, I am disgusted at the overwhelming popularity this movie has seen at the box office and since. I suppose over all, this is about the worst movie I can ever imagine being made, the biggest problem is that you can tell that people who like it and the people who made it, honestly believe this kind of garbage.

The four actresses were up to the material and were able to convey their characters' strengths and weaknesses effectively. I also appreciated (as a male) that the young men in the film were shown as caring and decent--not just ""dreamboats"", funny sidekicks, or sex-crazed drunken frat boys--the other male stereotypes in so many films aimed at teens. This is a movie I think most females can relate to and that most mature viewers could enjoy except, maybe, for the guys who are still in arrested development and think that the only good movie is one where people and things get blown up or otherwise destroyed.

That was definitely not in the book. They also forgot about Tibby's hamster which to me sort of defined her. Other than that the movie was good and they kept with the book.

If it works out you can be matched with a partner and get some more training with teacher and change the name to Dancing With The Unknown Stars. Something entertaining could come of it to make them big stars like on American Idol. I think they should give it a try and something could come of it. I think many people in the studios would agree to this. I have hated seeing people like Master P, Jerry Rice and George Hamilton. get voted for their popularity instead of how good they are. In the Australia version a TV weatherman with a small TV show won 2nd season who was more than just for his looks but how well he could dance. In Europe countries the only just vote on popularity but talent. They look at the talent because European people are not blind to popularity as we are. I have gone to a web page of the Netherland's show not really understanding what they say, but I see they are great dancers. The 4 former professional judges in Australia have never given a 40 (four 10's) and critic the dancers to tell them not just how good they are but what mistakes they made here in the USA they are just 3 critics and choreographers and gives perfect scores (3 of them 10's).",2006

I am not one to complain but this was not right.",2008
10,"My friends all think I watch this program for the skin-show but they couldn't be more wrong! Okay, who wouldn't enjoy watching such a lavish disply of youthful physicality? But Dancing With The Stars is SO much more than that. Start with the moment the professional dancer meets his (or her) new partner. That could be anything from a race car driver to a famous actress to a computer geek to a cowboy -- or who knows what else? The partners are from different worlds. They barely know each other but their destinies are now in each other's hands. In a matter of moments, they will be locked in embrace -- swaying -- gripping -- tumbling -- sliding sensuously together -- and spending entire days sweating all over each other from elevated head to pointed toe.",2009

3,Aren't people sick of this yet?,2009
1,"The reaction I have with this show is the same as when I used to watch ""Remote Control"" and they had that segment called ""Dead or Alive"" where they would say name of celebrities and contestants would guess if they were dead or alive. Here is almost the same: They announce the people on that and I always catch myself ""Oh, he/she is still alive?!?!?"". They are so Zlist celebs, half of them I have to search on Google to see what they do, there is always one or two though that you cannot believe they are there ( Jerry Springer, sometimes you gotta say NO to your agent) Then the competition, awful the dancing , the remix is worth a lawsuit (""Now Mario Lopez will dance the salsa"" - And it is the salsa remix of Like a Prayer). The judges are boring, even more than ... I cannot even think of another show with such bad judges. Even America's Next Top Model have better judges.",2006
5,"It is happening again as it did last year where the judges give high praise and marks several who are less talented than others. Last year we had P-Diddy(might be wring name),Geaorge Hamilton, and Jerry Rice and other more talented dancers got bounced early. Now this year we have Jerry Springer who stands there and lets his partner do the work and he stays and Vivaca Fox gets booted. I hear the judges are shocked but they are responsible for telling the audience how good he's doing. And the dramatic showing of him going over and hugging his daughter was nothing more ""on with the show"". Emmet Smith who I like and is doing as good a job as Jerry Rice did last year still doesn't have the moves of some of the other stars. I realize that some of the stars have tremendous star support which makes is all the more critical that the judges do their jobs properly. If the star does a poor job than give them the 2, 3, and 4's they deserve. 2006 review",2006

She is a world champion DANCING on ice, knows and is use to perform in front of millions of people, already knows how to be graceful(posture, hands etc). How unfair and ridiculous can you be. Even to choose music artist who do dance moves is absurd and unfair. What is amateur about Christie or the girl who won the UK dancing with stars. Get real. Jason should and deserve to win this competition and if Christian had not injured his arm - he would have walked it but no, you decide to put a already world champion dancer against them. I AM TOTALLY SICK TO MY STOMACH that that girl won. Unfair!!!!!!!!",2010

5,"So it has come out that AT&T accepts a certain amount of votes before none count anymore. The question is what is limit? Regardless of the voting counting issue. People who get 10's can lose to someone who has no dancing ability like Season 17 where Elizabeth Berkley who won two all 10's throughout the show's progression and lost to Bill Engvall, who has no dancing ability at all. I get them wanting to bring on people who are older for a larger audience but they need to invite people who can dance or at least have a shot. Bill Nye did way better to me than Bill Engvall that season and was booted so fast. This show is about POPULARITY NOT ABILITY. When you find out that the judges scores basically mean nothing compared to the people's votes then you see how sad this show is. I will say there are some seasons where the winner made sense but it is roll of the dice.",2015

At first, I wanted Billy Ray Cyrus to win, even if he was a bad dancer, because he is one of my favorite country singers, and not only because he was on Hannah Montana, although that is how I knew he was a country singer. But after Billy Ray Cyrus lost, I wanted Apollo to win, because he was a good dancer and he was cute. I was really happy when he did win. I like this show because dancing is my favorite sport, and I don't like how people don't think it is a sport. Dancing is a sport! Dancing With the Stars was very suspenseful during the results. And, the dancing was fun to watch because each pair had a completely different idea to choreograph it. Dancing with the Stars is one of my favorite television shows, and I am definitely going to watch it every night it is on, because it is great!",2007
8,"If you had ever told me that I would end up really liking a movie starring Marky Mark from the Funky Bunch and the lead singer of Outkast (the perpetrators of one of the most annoying songs in recent history - Hey Ya) then I would've laughed right in your face.

But I'm man enough to admit that I would've been wrong.",2005

The story moves along and does not step outside of itself. There are some intriguing plot twists, but the goal of revenge always remains. The performances are solid; we have experienced film actors and a director here who know what they're doing. Even the newer actors settle into their respective roles...",2005
7,"One good thing Steven Spielberg has done for 21th century movies is to show the importance of starting things off with a bang rather than a whimper, something he learned from the old grade B films of the 30's, 40's, and 50's. So when director John Singleton begins ""Four Brothers"" he doesn't dwell on background material about how mom came to be the shining star for her boys. Singleton goes right for the jugular by showing mom's demise--I say showing, the viewer doesn't actually see the killing in the beginning. Singleton builds up the relationship between mom and the brothers step by step, letting a Detroit policeman, Lt. Green (Terrence Howard), introduce the four brothers as they show up for the funeral and become reacquainted. Not to give away the story, one heavy leads to another until the whole city of Detroit becomes a personification of corruption and evil. I loved the Motown music played throughout the film which was very apropos for the setting.",2005

It is the new John Singleton movie Four Brothers, and what a good one it is.",2005
8,"I've always loved revenge movies, and this one fits the bill because it has four brothers trying to find out the truth of their mother's murder. The four brothers are all superb in their roles, as adopted brothers from foster care that went their separate ways, who come home to find out who killed their mother and why. The 8 minute AOL trailer on the movies sold me. Also superb is Terrence Howard as a Detroit cop who doesn't trust his own who is desperately trying to find out what happened himself. The plot is well executed through twists and turns. Mark Wahlberg just gets better and better. He was great in ""Three Kings,"" and he is better here.",2005

I'm normally not one for movies that are seemingly all about people getting revenge and lots of killing and fighting. I dunno..I'm not one for the action/drama type...unless it's a horror movie, and then I'm definitely there. Anyways, I was genuinely surprised at how good this movie ended up being. Each of the four brothers gave an amazing performance. Andre Benjamin showed that he's not only a talented singer, but a talented actor as well.",2005

Despite a few hitches (how cliché this movie really is, I.E. revenge), it really did deliver. All four of the brothers delivered the flavor that this movie probably would have needed and I must say that the screenplay must have been superb. This movie pays the obvious homage to Death Wish and it's been quite overdone, but not without receiving the credit it deserves.",2005

8,"''Four Brothers ''is an awesome movie who has a mixed genre: lots of Action,Drama and Thriller all together, makes a delicious movie to watch. I like Mark Wahlberg very much, so it was a pleasure to see him here,and I liked the other actors who played the other ''Mercers'' as well. (Garrett Hedlund is a cutie! And I am happy to see, here in IMDb, that he is one of the actors who are going to be present in the Eragon's movie!)",2006
8,"when John Singleton released Boyz n the Hood, i thought wow, a young, brilliant director with a future full of potential; a young genius with more exquisite films to come. Four Brothers could be the best film he's made since then, pulling great performances from Mark Wahlberg who surprised me so much in Boogie Nights, Tyrese Gibson, Andre Benjamin, Garrett Hedlund, and Terence Howard, who is always so good. And the score in his films is usually so fine. i didn't know rap qualified as music until i heard it in Boyz. And it's great here too. this film is stylish, poignant, active, and has some very clever moments. I don't think it's fair to compare this film to his others, but it is in stark contrast to the message he portrayed in his first film, that violence begets violence, that violence solves nothing, and that the worst in us has a chance at redemption. his themes of poverty, hopelessness, misdirection, and role models aren't really here. ironic, since their kindly and compassionate foster mother mentored a sense of safety, love, and acceptance in their make-shift family. instead, what we have here is a revenge film, vigilante justice, well-constructed scenes of brutality and violence. the background details were just fine, with it's fargoesque winter scenes, flash-backs, chases, and personalities, unexpected turns of events. Four Brothers is an entertaining film for adult audiences and worth a watch. but i am still waiting for Mr Singleton to make another masterpiece. This isn't it, but i'm still hoping that it's coming.",2005
3,"I was definitely looking forward to this movie, which is not hard to imagine for a John Singleton movie, especially with the cast its got. I love Mark Wahlburg, and couldn't wait to see Andre Benjamin's big screen debut, bla, bla, bla, BUT what a total disappointment! Actually those two were good, Tyrese too, but the story and dialogue were weak at best. I spent most of the movie wondering why people were doing what they were doing, why I should care about these thinly drawn, backgroundless and insubstantial characters, and who wrote that weak and chiche' dialogue that started out bad, oversimplified, and patronizing, and stayed that way. I kept wanting it to get better, and that was all that kept me from walking out before it was over.",2005

3,"have seen this one the other night and i'm very disappointed to say the least. according to IMDb votes and reviews this should be at least beyond average with fine acting and a nice story. Now as i find, this movie has so many holes in its plot, one might assume the script got shot during one of the action scenes. ridiculous twists in the story, very very VERY bad sequences that are simply unbelievable and that do not make much sense in the course of action (sometimes it is like Charles Bronson's Disney) and a cast that doesn't fit together at all. Now i realize that this is an adaption of Katie Elder and that it might not be that easy to transform a wild west story into today's world, but still as a writer/director you have to take care that the story conveys some realism, otherwise it gets laughable/boring and you as a viewer can't care less for what happens to the characters. unfortunately the filmmakers failed big time here and all their trying to give their characters a life and the storyline a ground was heavily countered by their sledgehammer-style in every way. not to mention the unreflected use of violence against ANYBODY with a big smile on the face which makes the major premise of the film that the old lady did a good job raising problematic boys and changing their life to the better, a big fat lie. just do not waste your time.",2008
1,"Some marginal actors got coaxed into this nothing-but-violence waste of time. Bunch of unruly people with guns shooting at each other (and the bad guys are the worst marksmen). Cars chase each other, crash but still keep going. They crash again and still keep going. A few more times, crash, BANG. Nobody is around to see or hear what must have been a loud chase although it is in the middle of a city. And how convenient for nobody else to be on the road. Bad guys, good guys. Bad cops, good cops. And more stuff you've never seen before. The real victims in this one were the people who wasted money to watch it.",2007
1,"This is an awful movie. I really don't know where to start but maybe it should be the actors. Actors are often called talent but sadly looking at this pile of steaming manure it is hard to see why. Marky Mark possesses all the subtlety of a skunk's fart. His kid brother played by Garrett Hedlund looks like he had a rancid burger a while back and still hasn't recovered. Andre 3000bc should stick to being an average musician and not try to be a below par actor. And as for the other one, Tyrese Gibson - he should go back to appearing on Moesha. The script is ludicrous, the dialogue laughable and in charge of this whole quagmire of idiocy is John Singleton who has directed a decent film since Boyz n the Hood. Honestly don't even bother. Unless you like your movies loud, dumb and pointless you should spend 90 minutes starring at the wall; you mightn't learn much but at least it won't insult you.",2006

9,"After not seeing much from Daniel Day-Lewis for a while, I was excited to see this film, though I was afraid it may not live up to what we expect from him. It was far better than I could have hoped, due not only to a terrific cast, but Rebecca Miller's writing and directing. The moments of humour ring with truth, and the characters have been developed so well, you feel voyeuristic. Daniel Day-Lewis is, as always, brilliant. The internal struggles his character goes through are poignant and completely believable. In fact, all of the characters in this story are a wonderfully realistic blend of black and white - all have virtues and all are flawed. Very thought-provoking and evocative. Visually beautiful, as well. This is a very underrated film and deserves far more recognition than it seems to have received.",2006
10,"I'm an Indy film addict, and was iffy about watching this one because of the description above, but on a whim i bought it and watched it and fell in love. The story of Jack and Rose is told so beautifully and perfectly that as the story progressed I found myself hoping that something would change, or hoping for some plot twist saying that rose wasn't his daughter, because I truly wanted these two to work out. The devotion between father and daughter is amazingly portrayed, Daniel Day-Lewis was perfect and I cannot imagine anyone else in this movie. Once i finished watching for the first time I found myself almost in a daze, the progression of Rose's whole being was a delicate matter that was handled beautifully. There was a feeling of tension throughout that drew me in. I have never fallen in love with a movie like this before. Bravo to the writer and cast and all involved. Thank you for this beautiful film about love, loss and culture change.",2005

8,"Loved the movie. The beautiful story went well with the picturesque setting in our smallest Canadian province on the east coast, Prince Edward Island, where the movie was filmed. Daniel Day Lewis was great. I wonder, did he have to lose a lot of weight to play the part? Ryan MacDonald did an excellent job and gave the movie some comedic relief. It brought back memories of the good old commune days! Maybe a return to those days might do our world some good. Beau Bridges gave a good performance as well but the sweet innocence of Rose was really the essence of the movie. You could feel the love connection between her and her father, be it father/daughter love or the love felt between lovers.",2005
10,"Rebecca Miller has written and directed another fine film that probes the consequences of the passage of time and life, finding incongruities in ideals and realities impacting everyday people. The result is a film of tenderness and dashed hopes and unconditional love between a father and daughter.",2005
8,"There's nothing more exciting than seeing quality work come from a group of unknowns. While Daniel Day Lewis and Catherine Keener are the marquee name anchors for the film the most delightful surprises come from Camilla Bell and Ryan McDonald who give honest and often very mature performances. McDonald in particular has a knack for off-beat humor and gets some of the best lines in the film. Given the gorgeous setting, the beautiful cinematography and the high caliber writing I can't think of a better film I've seen so far this year. The movie is not without its flaws, but they're minimal in relation to all the elements that are wonderfully right.",2005

Daniel Day-Lewis is the Jack of the title, a hippie growing old with health problems, living on an expired commune-haven from the sixties on an island, now being encroached upon by developers.

7,"First off, a toast to this movie for being filmed in my home province of Prince Edward Island, and for giving my uncle a ""Special Thanks"" credit. Local connections aside, ""The Ballad of Jack and Rose"" (which I think sounds like an alternate title for ""Titantic"") is an unusual, offbeat, thoroughly ""indie"" movie, and it's definitely worth seeing for the contrast with standard Hollywood fare. Daniel Day-Lewis, a rare but welcome presence on our theatre screens, plays Jack, an aging hippie who lives with his daughter Rose (Camilla Belle, in a breathtaking performance) on an otherwise-deserted commune. The commune is a private nature park (go PEI!), but is being threatened by a developer (a cameo appearance by Beau Bridges), and, more pertinently, the arrival of Jack's girlfriend Kathleen (Catherine Keener) and her two sons (Ryan Macdonald and Paul Dano). Rose's isolationist childhood has rendered her rather sociopathic, and with an Elektra complex. She wants Kathleen dead, and she wants to get back at her father for his perceived betrayal. Day-Lewis gives a characteristically good performance, but the movie is, surprisingly, much more about Rose than Jack. Camilla Belle is a wonderful (and very beautiful) actress, and I hope her career is a success. It would be a shame to lose such a promising talent. Ryan Macdonald is notable as Kathleen's son Rodney, a warm and understanding character stuck in a rather depressing family. The film contains a great deal of obvious symbolism, which audiences will either enjoy or find irritatingly over-the-top. I guess I'm in the former camp. I give ""The Ballad of Jack and Rose"" a 7/10.",2005
2,"Master filmmaker Yasujiro Ozu made one of his great masterworks about the unearthly devotion between a father and a daughter with 1949's ""Late Spring"". Director-screenwriter Rebecca Miller has a similar idea in mind here, as she has fashioned a story set in 1986 around the same inextricable bond between a 1960's drop-out Jack and his teenage daughter Rose on an isolated island. She has an intriguing idea for the film's theme, the disillusionment of the idealism borne out of the 1960's anti-war movement and the encroachment of capitalism upon a former commune's idyllic setting.",2005
9,"One thing about The Ballad of Jack and Rose, and it's no small thing: Whoever made the trailer seems to have actually cared. All or nearly all its ""catch"" shots and dialog come from the film's first several minutes. The trailer isn't good. Virtually no trailer is that. But, if I recall, as every trailer should be, it's a puzzle, an unnarrated montage, whose answers can be found by seeing the film.",2005
5,The Ballad of Jack and Rose reviewed by Sam Osborn ,2005
8,"Admit it or not, the only strength of this film lies in the nature of Jack and Rose's relationship. Director and screenwriter Rebecca Miller used much of her creative potential to include life's every kind of misadventure to make that relationship undeniably unique. For a film about such a complex father-daughter relationship she needed some really strong actors. Now Mr. Day-Lewis is a phenomenon when it comes to acting... we all know that after ""Gangs of New York"" or ""My Left Foot"". But the real surprise came from Camilla Belle whose portrayal of dangerously innocent and emotionally frail Rose is a real inspiration to all the actresses of her generation. The short scene she shares with Jason Lee is perhaps the best example. Day-Lewis' Jack is outstanding in his own right. My favorite scene is when he breaks down to tears before Marty; or the night he spent with Rose in the house he crashed down later.",2006
6,"I saw the world premiere of ""Jack and Rose"" at the Sundance Film Festival, and I had such high hopes for this movie. And it delivering on some things - the cinematography was great. The location could not have been more beautiful and appropriate. The acting was very good (I thought that there were times when Camilla out-shown Daniel Day Lewis). However, i felt that the story was not as originally approached as it could have been. And the way the movie was edited didn't seem to go with the story. I understand using a disjointed time line in order to communicate confusion and other emotions, but in this case it was just distracted, and added absolutely nothing. I was also disappointed that some of the sub-stories did not fully develop when they were some of the most interesting parts of the movie.",2005
10,A very well written script with a unique type of humor. The photography was outstanding. Interesting and innovative camera movements. Not one bad performance among some of the relatively unknown actors. Each of the eight parts had a well developed character arc. There were several scenes which put you on the edge of your seat in eager anticipation as to how the scene was going to play out. A beautiful flow from scene to scene. There is simply not one moment in the entire film where the movie lags. Daniel Day Lewis was amazing . . . as usual. Saw it at the Sundance Film Festival. Can't wait to see it again and to get a copy of the script.,2005

Sergio Castellitto debuts as director, starring with Penelope Cruz, in a movie made from his wife Margaret Mazzantini's novel, 'Non ti Muovere ('Don't Move'). While good communication and personal commitment are likely advantages of husband-and-wife collaborations, lack of objectivity could be a danger. But surely these should be performances worth watching? Yet for some reason, neither 'Don't Move' nor 'Jack and Rose' has met with wide approval from local critics. Let's consider why.",2005

I think you are the world's best screen actor. And I respect you for not jumping at every bad script that comes your way.",2005
1,"Just weren't up to the job. Admittedly the script was suppose to be witty and profound but everything about it seemed so forced and familiar. It was like a really good film school project, amateurish best describes it. Also, the Jack and Rose were too well groomed and hip to the styles of the day to be truly believable as two people who have lived like hermits, virtually alone for 15 or so years. Oh and WAY too many lingering one shots of imagery meant to provoke some canned response (forboding, transformation. etc/)from the viewer but somehow just seem entirely out of context and obvious, again a new director trying out old tricks and nothing to them. I really wonder if Daniel Day Lewis would have done this if his wife wasn't the director/writer, etc. It's really below his usual fare and he really didn't communicate his character very well. He didn't explain himself much and what he did say was confusing and were in conflict with his actions. He's dying of some heart disease which hasn't stopped he hand-rolled chain smoking ways, I don't know if he smokes knowing it doesn't make any difference, he's a dead man walking OR if his continued smoking has actually made his heart attack inevitable, that if he had stopped he would have lived longer? I was really hoping he would ""pass over"" in the model home. He would have hated that. The irony! But know we have a pseudo psycho movie ending with an overly dramatic, not to mention the melodramatic and ""distraught"" daughter setting up her father's (now dead, flower decorated corpse) to be the end domino in a gasoline doused trail of memorabilia from his ex-wife (her mother) postcards, letters, etc. Finally she sets the flame to action only to ""escape"" out thew window and fairy the power boat off to..........two years later, and a new actress playing Rose (who has dramatically plumped up and is not nearly as luminous) is arranging flowers in her, what appears to be, self-funded flower co-op. And guess who is there with her? Yeah, the weird Jason Lee character that obviously had been heavily cut from the movie. I mean, were we suppose to glean something from his ""emotions"" - if that's the case than I flunk ""Jasonese"" - I mean this is the guy who named his kid ""Rocket Inspektor"" or something equally crazy - well after all he is a Scientologist and that tells you about everything you need to know about him, at least at this point in his life). One prop I will give him is his role in ""Almost Famous"" loved him in that movie. Loved that movie. This one was just....excruciatingly boring and just not very well acted or written, or directed, or costumed, or...oh you get my drift.",2005
2,"You won't get any spoilers here, I didn't hang around long enough to know how it ended. An hour was more than enough.",2007
3,"I thought this was truly going to be a story about a man who wanted to raise his daughter in a specific way - ""green"" the descriptions said. Okay - I get that. So the movie starts, and there is a man and his daughter, but I cannot figure out their history or current story. There is definitely something not quite right about not only their relationship, but the daughter. She seems otherworldly, but not in a good way. So far out there that quite possibly she would never be redeemed. I am left to assume that this is a throwback to the hippy generation and somebody's misguided attempt to show that ""the life"" of communes and living on the land with no actual need for not only the necessities, but the standards, of modern day was the way to go and the rest of us really missed the boat. That's one ship on which I am happy not to have sailed! At least I know why I have never seen this movie associated with Daniel Day Lewis or one of my favorite actresses, Catherine Keener. This work was quite below what they are able to give. The end? I'm still shaking my head and rolling my eyes.",2005
8,***** This Review May Contain MINOR Spoilers! ***** ,2016
1,"Everett (Mulroney) takes his ""uptight"" city girlfriend Meredith (SJP) home to meet his family for Christmas. His family turns out to be the biggest bunch of fake, hypocritical, horrible and judgemental people you'll ever meet and have decided, even without meeting Meredith, that she's unworthy of any hospitality.",2006
1,"I would give it a zero out of ten if I could. This movie fails as a comedy, as a drama, as everything. The characters are so cliché and hackneyed, it is unbelievable. There seem to be about twenty of them (the characters), and throughout the movie they meet, fall in and out of love, fight, whine, act ridiculous and erratic, wallow in self-pity, and are generally just irritating. Through most of the movie I was saying to myself, ""who ACTS like that?"" Most of the characters are so unlikeable that their behaviour makes it impossible to care at all about what happens to them.",2007
5,"I must disagree with many of the film's critics who found this to be a pleasant and amusing view of a complicated family holiday reunion. Perhaps because of my background as a mental health professional, I found this to be a very confusing and inconsistent attempt to picture what could have been a funny family event. The writers touched so many bases that one wonders if five families could have contained the many quirks, pathologies and eccentricities found in this single unit. My overall impression was of the incredible nastiness this family displayed toward the fiancée of the eldest son, a person no one but the youngest daughter had ever met, but who became the target of hostility, primarily based on the report given by the nasty little sister. The fact that the parents were incapable of maintaining even a modicum of civility or to set the example for the children, speaks to their dysfunction rather than the humor of the situation. Yes, I realize that a terminal illness was also an issue, and yes, Keaton is a fine actress, but her character failed the test of grace--more the writer's fault than Keaton's.",2006
7,"The premise of ""The Family Stone"" sounds a little shopworn: Everett Stone brings his uptight girlfriend Meredith home for Christmas to meet his large family, who instantly dislike her. Even worse, the trailer reveals most of the plot's complications. However, this premise has been used so often because it reliably provides opportunities for comedy, drama, and insight into family dynamics. ""The Family Stone"" proves itself a better-than-average example of the genre because of its talented cast and reasonably intelligent script.",2006
1,SPOILERS WITHIN:,2006
2,"Mildly entertaining, but any entertainment value is overshadowed by the absurd and insulting meanness of this movie. In a nutshell, an uncertain, anxious young woman goes with her fiancé to meet his family at Christmastime. The family is rude, snobbish and insulated in their ""liberal"" (read ""wildly intolerant"") values to the point of being sickening. They - even the very mature parents! - proceed to treat this young woman with the most appalling rudeness, showing her zero hospitality and never hesitating to insult and humiliate her to her face. The situation and the characters are artificial and embarrassing. Of course, Diane Keaton, Craig T. Nelson and Claire Danes have the acting chops to pull these characters off, but the characters and the story are so hateful, who cares if the acting is good? In the end, it's all tied with with some improbable hook ups, the mom character dies of cancer - there's a sentimental pan to one-year-later so the audience can see how wonderfully it all turned out - and the moviegoer can gratefully get up an leave. (Should have left at the first hint of what this film would turn out to be....)",2008
8,"Having seen the previews on a number of occasions I went to see this film because I was in the mood for a comedy. I guess the preview were all of the funny scenes. However, this turned out to be one of the most touching and sensitive movies I have seen in quite some time. The family stone could be almost anyones family and especially mine. The funny scenes were truly that, funny and very believable, one liners you wish you had said. The acting was first rate, I most enjoyed Diane Keaton and Craig Nelson. The movie moves along well with no dead time and while it is predicable in its storyline with no big surprises it is a very enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours. You get your moneys worth.",2006
1,"I just finished watching this film on my On Demand. I had to rewind, stop, and start the movie 3 times because I thought OnDemand was deleting scenes. THAT'S how ridiculous, unbelievable, and choppy this movie is. I really thought we lost the first half-hour or so, because SJP enters the Stone family household, and they immediately hate her. I thought, oh, well we must have missed the huge lead-in to that. NO! There was no lead-in. The family just flat-out hated the girlfriend of their son for no reason at all. Once I realized we didn't miss the first few scenes, I knew this movie would be disastrous.",2006
1,I can't even impart in words how truly abysmal this film is. And I had low expectations going in. I figured it would just be some goofy stupid and slightly girlier version of MEET THE PARENTS. Wholesome and stupid family fun. Everybody is happy. family values get rienforced. Like an Episode of SEVENTH HEAVEN on a Hollywood budget...just without the Jesus-loving.,2006
1,"I thought I saw somewhere this was a comedy. It had actors and actresses I've enjoyed in other films, it's the holidays, I wanted to get some laughs and have a good time.",2006
1,"Watching this film was like shooting yourself in the head, having the spurting blood spell out ""The Family Stone"" in drippy writing, and then having to carry on living in complete agony and brain-deadness. I need to emphasise how shocked I am at the absurdly high average review rating, but I should qualify my comments with some evidence. I could probably do a minute-by-minute massacre of this film (yes, EVERY minute was worth a good napalming), but for the sake of the readers, I'll keep it brief, and in order of heinousness: 1)This film may have been sponsored by the KKK for the extent to which it manages to undermine good ""liberal"" qualities. The whole point of liberalism is accepting that people may have an opposing values to your own without thinking they should be hanged for holding such views. The family's unrealistically immediate hatred of Meredith and their cruel treatment of her when she has done nothing to actively offend them is totally incongruous with the pot-smoking Benetton models that formed the family. 2) Why in God's name would you want your child to be gay? Why would you actively WANT your child to be ANYTHING?? Its logically as bigoted to say that you wish for gay children as if you said you absolutely didn't want your children to be gay. You wish for happy children, regardless of their sexual orientation. 3)Sarah Jessica Parker was completely unable to break out of her Sex and the City character, which meant that when she was acting uptight, it seemed completely unbelievable. Her supposedly 'drunken' scene was some of the worst acting I've ever seen. It was like the popular girl at school being in a school play, acting drunk but not doing any of the embarrassing things (i.e. slurring, very BAD dancing) that would actually make the drunkenness realistic, for fear of looking bad. 4)Stupid formulae, which are completely condescending to the audience. e.g. At the beginning, Meredith = uptight = hair scraped back in bun...BUT at the end...Meredith = more relaxed/in love = hair loose and down 5)Horrible script trying to be like Royal Tenenbaums type of quirky but completely failing. Does any mother ever comment to a complete stranger that a certain guy has 'popped' her daughter's 'cherry' in front of said daughter? Come on. Why does laid-back Ben fall in love with Meredith - because he wants a challenge or because he dreams of 'being the snow' that Meredith shovels. Oooh how arty. Eat my shorts. 6)Meredith's sister and the fiancé are a pair of whores who think they're lives should mimic some stupid French novel where people fall in love over a schmaltzy story set in some country where people are foreign and therefore can be patronised (that would be us, viewer). And you can swoon over the fact that Meredith's sister is such a great person that she'll come to the Stone family home to comfort her completely terrorised sister - what a catch. Oh, except that she's a complete cow who takes her sister's fiancé (regardless of her three minute hesitation) and doesn't go out to see if her sister's OK when they hear her car crash in the driveway. Twice. Hmmmmm. (And her hair is far too shiny)",2006
1,"Ususally i am not the kind of movie goer that is into ""romatic comedies"" but i saw the trailer and i thought, ""What the heck?"", it seemed like it would be funny, well i was totally proved wrong. I did think the first half was funny, but i was really surprised and disappointed that they totally turned the ending into a far fetched situation. I hated that the siblings switched lovers, that was really stupid and i don't think it worked right at all!!! This movie could have been good but whoever thought that would be legit, are freaking crazy.I don't think i would be OK with my sister with my ex boyfriend, ever in any situation!",2005
8,"I admit, I only rented this DVD because I like the Wilson brothers and one of them (Luke) is in it. I don't even remember this film being in the theaters. But I loved it! It was one of the most entertaining movies I've seen in quite awhile. Cinematically, it was nothing impressive, but the writing and the acting was quite good and the end actually made me cry (that's pretty hard to do). It is a rare movie where I can honestly say, everyone in the cast did a great job. And the screenwriters did a great job too. One problem with a lot of Hollywood films, for me at least, is the unbelievability of the characters or the one-sidedness of characters. All of the characters in this film were believable and had good and bad aspects to them. I guess if you are looking for a more fantasy-based storyline, this wouldn't be the film for you. The interactions are all very realistic and it plays out like a realistic holiday that could occur in just about any family. You won't come away from the film learning any great, deep lessons, but you will come away feeling entertained, and wishing that you could keep in touch with the characters to see where their lives take them.",2007
8,"I totally agree with The Unemployed Critic that the trailers (and the poster) for ""The Family Stone"" are misleading, and ultimately an insult to the film. My husband and I are cinema addicts, but the trailers convinced us that we could live without another silly and predictable ""clash of family cultures"" movie. Fortunately the good-to-glowing reviews in American and Australian papers encouraged us to at least give the film a chance. We were rewarded with great writing and acting, lots of laughs and some tears. ""The Family Stone"" was my favourite of the many movies we saw over the Holidays -- but we almost missed out on it, due to bad Marketing.",2006
1,"I was sure that I would enjoy this movie, given its stellar cast and funny trailer. I thought it would be a heartwarming movie about misunderstandings and the mutual awkwardness of meeting your in-laws.",2006
1,"I really don't understand how people could enjoy this crappy mix of comedy and drama. It is clear that the director didn't know what he wanted this movie to be-a comedy, a drama, a family movie. Whatever his/her intent, it failed on all counts. This movie couldn't be more unrealistic. For all you people out there with families, would it be acceptable if your fiancé hooked up with your sister? Or if your fiancé hooked up with your brother? Considering the high rating for this filth, you people at IMDb consider that event to not only be normal but entertaining as well! And what was the unnecessary stuff about the breast cancer? Come on, that had nothing to do with Dylan McDermott's character wanting to marry Sarah Jessice Parker. Most surprising of all, how could all of this good talent agree to do this stupid script? Please explain it to me how they would all choose to do this ridiculous montage of so many different movies. My wife and I rarely turn off a movie before it is over, and we did with this one0mainly because of the stupid acceptable sway of fiances for siblings. If any of you out there think that this movie is in any way realistic, your families are more screwed up than the Stones. Last, the previews did not depict this movie in any way similar to what the movie actually gave us.",2006

1,"I just watched this movie on TV and what a total waste. It was so bad I didn't even watch the rest. I usually watch everything even though I think it's bad, but I couldn't stand this one. I saw the trailer and thought this movie must be O.K with that kind of cast no actor/actress can save this disaster. I seriously disliked every minute of this movie. The story and characters were unbelievable, unrealistic the whole thing just made me angry. I didn't watched the whole movie, but I read about the ending, and it was just as I though it would be, it sucked. The fact the Julie ended up with Everett, and Meredith ended up with Ben is ridiculous! Julie which supposed to be this caring and supporting sister didn't even check on her sister when she stormed out crying and crashing the car twice outside of the house. Everett the boyfriend, did not go after his girlfriend, but his brother Ben did. Then Everett and Julie go outside together ""looking for Meredith"" (after they all finished dinner and Julie was reading some book to some kid on the couch like she been in the family for ages) which turns out to like they are on a date walking around the town, instead of actually looking for Meredith If I wrote about all the bad things in this movie it would take me forever. I have never been so mad after watching a movie that I didn't finish watching. I just had to write my frustration somewhere, and I want to warn everybody that haven't watched this crap yet. Don't waste your time on this, you'll have more fun watching dog poo",2011
1,"This movie had great actors and the potential to become a really good movie. The bottom line is ""Hollywood does not have a clue to what a true American family is like, better yet they don't have a clue to what a real family is like, ""period""."" Homosexuals raising a baby, a mother talking about her daughter's first experience as if it was a common meal on a menu, two brothers sleeping with two sisters. I mean come on. It felt like I was watching a Jerry Springer show. Just when I tried to feel empathy for one of the characters, the movie would take a downward spin. The only positive thing that came out of the movie was that we were able to see the other side of the story for a dysfunctional family. However, once I saw what family was like through that perception, I was even more turned off. I've got an idea. How about a real Christmas movie that doesn't have a political agenda?",2006
1,This movie is so awful that I decided to write this after viewing it on TV one day I was sick and awake at 1AM. I am liberal and so I didn't have any problem with the 'stoned' qualities of the family portrayed in the movie. SJP acting is really good and I disliked her character so much when I saw this movie about 6 years ago that I sided with the Stones.,2012
1,"This is one of the most mean spirited and inhumane movie that I have ever seen. To be honest, I did not see the end (I could not finish it), but I assume that I did not miss much. Everybody is so mean to the poor fiancée, Meredith, who desperately tries to be kind! Even her sister, called in to ease the bullying, can't care less! The scenario is so sick, I'm wondering about the mental health of the writer. Poor Diane Keaton, she must have been desperate to accept such a role in such a movie. At the dinner, on Christmas Eve, when the topic is on homosexuality (one of the son is gay), the mother says how she would have liked all of her sons to be homosexuals so she could have kept them for herself. Meredith then tries to know if she really means that, and tries to explain how usually parents don't wish this because to be homosexual certainly must not make life easier? Of course, everybody reacts as if she disapproves of it, and believe me, she is in for a damn ride of bullying. This was so unreal! She desperately tries to explain to them the real meaning of what she said (which by the way was so easy to understand), but no one, not even her fiancé, tries to understand. This scene was so disgusting, as really was the entire movie. It left me with an incredibly sad taste.",2006

I've already seen ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""Raging Bull"" this year, and accidentally watched part of one of the ""son of Rocky"" serial movies on a Saturday afternoon.

10,"My heart was firmly lodged in my throat for the last hour and a half of The Cinderella Man. Nobody does true-story heroism like Ron Howard, and few can do heroes like Russell Crowe. Though Howard fictionalizes his subjects, and does not pretend to make documentaries, he does accurately depict the feeling and the major points of his subjects. ",2005

I am not a boxing fan, but I was so engrossed by the character of the Cinderalla Man that I was totally involved in every punch. I didn't know how the story would end, so I had the added thrill of suspense during the final fight.",2005
10,"If the great depression of the 1930s is a mystery to you, then Cinderella Man can fix that. The story, about the ups and downs in the career of a boxer, is uplifting and entertaining. However, what makes this film more than that is its believable depiction of the great depression.",2006

9,"I also went to a sneak preview of this movie last night, and it was good enough for me to join this site and write my first review. It did start out kind of slow, but the complete rainbow of emotions was contained in this movie. There were parts that nearly made you cry. There were parts that made you laugh out loud. I could barely contain my excitement during the last 15-20 minutes of the movie, I just wanted to scream out loud I was so excited. When we left the theater there was a ~60 year old woman delicately shadow boxing on her way out the door. Her husband asked her, ""Are you winning?"" She said, ""I'm going to have dreams about this movie tonight."" This was a great movie, and I would recommend it highly.",2005

9,"I went to a preview screening here in Minneapolis last night, 5/5/05. They said that we were the first people in Minnesota to see the move. Well, let me just say that this is one of the best movies that I've ever seen - Russell Crowe and Ron Howard have done it again! It starts a bit slow, but it gives you background into the life of Jimmy Braddock, a once great boxer who fell into hard times because of the great depression. Him and his family experienced all the heartaches that everyone else did at that time.",2005
10,"We went to this movie today at Albuquerque, New Mexico. My first impression upon looking at the title was ""sounds kinda girly movie"". I have no idea who Jim Braddock is until I saw this movie. Its truly inspiring and amazing. All actors excelled in their action. Its gripping all the way till the end. I don't want to tell the story and spoil the spirit. It was never boring the entire movie.",2005
7,"Cinderella Man is the story of a Depression-era boxer and American hero Jim Braddock, but it contains enough love interest, family interest, and great-champion-of-the-people interest to satisfy most Saturday night out filmgoers.

Generally, when I go in with high expectation (and this film was the one I was most looking forward to this year) I come out more than a little disappointed, although the films are often good, they rarely live up to my rampant anticipation.

It's ""beautifull"" to see that 2 people stand a long time on their love. But in this movie you get a view of results of the depression, where hunger and soberness is normal. ",2006
7,"With Ron Howard directing and Russell Crowe, Renee Zellweger, and Paul Giamatti starring, Cinderella Man was sure to be a worthwhile cinematic experience, if only it hadn't been released in the unsuitable summer months of blockbuster fever. It didn't help that previous DreamWorks summer hit Seabiscuit starred a horse (and was more emotionally uplifting without being too violent or predictable), or that Cinderella Man was preceded by last year's Oscar winner Million Dollar Baby or the lackluster NBC reality series The Contender. But even when taken out of context, Cinderella Man is a fine, elaborately and accurately produced (if minimalistic) Depression-era boxing-pic love story that simply doesn't go where no great movie hasn't gone before.",2005

I can only think of a couple negatives. One being the man coughing behind me the WHOLE time. In terms of the movie, the section where the Braddocks suffer in the Depression went on pretty long, and the Braddock's kids were WAY too cute. A little shamelessly so. As in, no three kids are that well-behaved,loving and adorable ALL THE TIME. Great points: There were a lot more funny moments than i had expected, but none were cheap laughs, all were just honest and nice little moments. The acting and directing are just incredible. Renee Zellweger, Russel Crowe, Paul Giamatti (who practically steals the show), even Craig Bierko as the boxing nemesis were so great! Oscars FOR EVERYONE! It's too bad this isn't Oscar season-- i really hope this doesn't get forgotten by the time nominations come out.",2005

9,"I think that The Corpse Bride is a beautiful story. It's about true love and kindness. Johnny Depp is a perfect Victor Van Dort and all the characters are played wonderfully. The animation is superb from facial expressions to a reflection in a tear drop. The ending is one worth waiting for. It's an excellent film that all families should see. I'd suggest not taking children younger than 8 or 9. They might not understand the story line that young, but they'll love the dancing skeletons and the fun songs! That was a surprise: all the songs they sang. If there's one song you must hear it has to be the skeleton one, but also the piano sequence is beautiful as well. Hope you enjoy the film as much as I did!",2005
8,I got to go to an advance screening of 'Corpse Bride'. The anticipation for the movie was high as the theater audience was clapping and yelling.,2005
8,"After enchanting audiences with ""The Nightmare Before Christmas,"" Tim Burton brings another stop-motion animated spectacle, ""Corpse Bride."" In this story, Victor Van Dort, an inept young groom-to-be, can't make his way through his wedding rehearsal. Going outside to get his lines right, he accidentally winds up marrying the corpse of a murdered bride-to-be. The animation is spectacular, proving stop-motion can be good enough to compete with computer animation. Johnny Depp provides the voice of Victor, showing mild-mannered and nervous grace. Helena Bonham Carter is the voice of Emily, the Corpse Bride, giving the dead character lively emotion. One striking element of the movie is the color scheme. In the living world, there is no bright color, making a near-black and white appearance. The story is well-written, and the music is good. Overall, ""Corpse Bride"" must definitely be seen!",2005
9,"In Tim Burton's dazzling Corpse Bride, both Tim Burton fan freaks (I was raised on Edward Scissorhands and Beetlejuice) and new inductees alike will find something to like here. The exceptional stop-motion animation (which has seen an upgrade since 1993's classic Nightmare Before Christmas) joins with top-notch voice talent (Depp and Helena Bonham Carter stand out here) and typically good score/musical work from genius Danny Elfman to create a wonderful movie-going experience. Yes, this is a movie for anyone - in fact, I think teens and young adults will enjoy it more than younger kids with its dark at times bold humor and fast-paced banter (particulary in the clever songs). NO, it is not as good as Nightmare Before Xmas, but it may be that it would be hard for any film to match that picture. As usual, Tim Burton is always at the top of his game when he sticks to his favorite formula - exploring the darkness of the human soul with off-beat humor. Well-paced and a terrific ending wrap up this well-crafted package! 9/10 stars - it's awesome.",2005
9,"Don't let the creepy title of this animated, musical tale throw you off. In the tradition of other excellent, animated features of recent years, The Corpse Bride will surely rank as one of the best. Granted, this kind of film may not be for all tastes, but if you can get past the title and are game for a wondrous, haunting world of fantasy and love, then this is your meal ticket.",2005
10,"This film is 100% spectacular, in my opinion. As we all know from the previews prior to the release, Johnny Depp's character must choose between his living and dead brides, essentially. To be perfectly honest, throughout most of the film, I was undecided on who I thought he'd choose and be able to work it out with. This is accounted for by wonderful story-fying and lovely screen writing! Danny Elfman is the musical genius still, not that I had any doubts.",2005
10,"Tim Burton's Corpse Bride was one of the best animated movies I've ever seen. My mother and I are so happy that he made another beautiful and original animated film since The Nightmare Beofre Christmas because we waited for it for 10 years. I'm glad to say that the wait was worth it. The Corpse Bride is a wonderful emotional yet fun story with heart. We had a wonderful time watching it in the theaters and we can't wait to go see it again this weekend. The visuals are so amazing that you'd have to go see the movie with your own eyes for its impossible to explain there perfection. The characters all look stunning and there are so many wonderful new characters in this movie that will keep your eyes glued on the screen. The voices of Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter and Emily Watson are packed with fantastic emotion and acting. The score goes very well to the movie and the four songs that are performed sound wonderful. My favorites were ""Remains of the Day"" made me feel like dancing: it was such a jazzy fun song with the cool voice of Danny Elfmen. And my other favorite was ""Tears To Shed"" it broke my heart. Helena Bonham Carter sang that song with such heartbreak I loved it! The story is very entertaining and it has so much heart in it and Gothic like background. I loved the dialog some of my favorite lines were ""Why Go Up There When People Are Dying To Get Down Here"" and ""Can A Heart Still Break Once It's Stopped Beating."" But the most important thing is that this movie makes you feel less frightened about death. Death in this movie is a lot funner than living and the dead are always having a good time and partying that you feel like dying is not so bad. You should take anyone to see this movie if their paranoid about death it will soften their fears, Overall I strongly encourage anyone to go see this movie. I hope Tim Burten wins the Oscar for best animated movie this year. He truly deserves it! Thank you Mr. Burten for the Corpse Bride, Nightmare Before Christmas and years worth of your great films.",2005
10,"I gotta tell you.Animation films these days are just getting better and better.Tim Burton's directing and vision succeeds once again.For almost the whole movie,I could tell everyone in the theater was enjoying it.",2005
10,"Corpse Bride works for me on so many levels but outstanding is the integration of music and words. The musical that blended the words and music to such a level that one could hardly imagine the film without the composer's contribution. This should be advertised as Danny's production as was the practice of Rogers and Hammerstein, or Irving Berlin or Cole Porter. We have a new art form here: the animated opera. Music is alive and well in the world of the dead. The music in the titles presents themes which continue into the film. An important part of the love story is the interest of the main characters and their methods of expression of emotion via piano music. The characters exist in an aura of sound. Imagine a Russian epic without the Lara Theme or Rick's place without Sam's piano. This film has achieved an identity that says this is music and this is what the movies has to say. All awards to those involved!",2005
8,"Hello all. I had the privilege to catch an advance screening of ""Corpse Bride"" today so here's my take on it.",2005
8,"i just saw this movie at the Toronto film festival. Tim Burton, as with most of his movies, makes the setting and visuals the most important part. And what a beautiful movie it was, the animation was astounding. You could tell that each frame was tirelessly worked on in order to make each little piece have its own distinct look. The plot is unimportant, and cliché, but that doesn't matter. This movie shouldn't be watched for the storyline. The voice acting was very convincing, especially the lead, Johnny Depp, who does a great job as the shy, clumsy Victor. The only character i really didn't think was needed was the worm, who was just included just for some childish comedic relief, which took away from the dark mood of the picture. Though not as enjoyable as ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" it still was a very good animated movie. 8.5/10",2005
9,"I recently did something that I haven't done for over 20 years: I bought a movie soundtrack. That was because I was so enchanted by Danny Elfman's score in ""The Corpse Bride"" that I HAD to hear it again ... and again. What with the haunting main melody heard throughout the movie contrasted with the catchy jazz tunes of the underworld (the name of the lounge was the ""Ball and Socket"") plus songs like ""The Remains of the Day"", ""Tears to Shed"", ""The Wedding Song"" and a brief piano solo (and a piano duo), I really felt, as some IMDb reviewers have alluded to, that I was watching a Broadway production. It was also interesting to note that Danny Elfman was the voice of the underworld band leader (Bonejangles).",2006
7,"I probably would have liked this movie more if I had not already seen - many times - ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" which was a brilliant and original piece of work. This movie does share some of that movie's qualities - haunting soundtrack, bumbling authority figures, a tall thin protagonist who is searching for something, a heroine whose limbs easily detach, and a dear departed house pet. It also has some interesting ideas of its own - the living looking and acting as though they were already dead, versus the dead living it up, since they have no more worries and forever to look forward to with the prospect of all of their loved ones returning to them one by one. In fact, the only time the living seem happy in this film is when the dead return to the land of the living for a truly unique wedding and instead of menacing or haunting the living, there are tearful and happy reunions. However, the individual characters in this film are just not that interesting.",2015
8,Burton takes another playful swipe at his stop-motion heroes with this nicely-done treat.,2005
8,"This stick-figure animated film offers good visuals, inventive-looking characters (that being perhaps the most fun of the film), and a decent story that finished with a very nice ending. There are songs in here but they are only so-so, and certainly not the attraction to the film.",2007
9,"As the credits came up, the audience applauded. How often does that happen? ",2005
9,"Tim Burton's ""Corpse Bride"" is deceivingly titled. Though its lead character is in fact dead, ""Corpse Bride"" is inspired dark comedy and an unexpected touching love story. ""Corpse Bride"" is traditional stop action animationa very time consuming process. A lot of time was also invested in the movie's storytelling. ""Corpse Bride"" is a macabre fairy tale. Director Tim Burton is either hit or miss for me. Burton as usual is absurd and eccentric, but here he also follows a conventional fairy tale in spirit. This is largely due to the screenplay by John August, Pamela Pettler, and Caroline Thompson. Their crafted tale is funny, clever, and also in love with its characters. Burton's ""Corpse Bride"" is all hit. An almost unrecognizable Johnny Depp voices Victor Van Dort the young man who inadvertently ""marries"" the Corpse Bride (voiced by the wonderful Helena Bonham Carter). Being that they are literally from different worldsone being that of the livingtheir future is cursed, so to speak. Their believable love story ultimately makes ""Corpse Bride"" this wildly funny dark fairy tale about love and selflessness. Very cool stuff.",2005
10,"I am part of a select few here in the las Vegas area, that have been privy to a advance screening of THE CORPSE BRIDE. I have to say it was one of Burton's best. I used to think his animated short VINCENT, was his second best. Having JUST seen the movie ( no more than 45 min ago ) This movie was just as good as nightmare. Actually, you could see were there are even better moments in the CORPSE BRIDE. ( IE new camera moves ). ",2005
7,"I like Tim Burton a lot as a director,and I always liked his movies; maybe that's why I imagined that Corpse Bride would be fantastic, like Nightmare Before Christimas; the movie itself is not horrible, but it's not the great story I was expecting to be,you probably know how it is going to end with 35 minutes of animation. But the scenarios are great, the doll's expressions are lovely and the voices of Johnny Depp,Helena Bonham Carter and Emily Watson are cool.:D",2005
10,"I saw this movie recently, seeing as Tim Burton and Johnny Depp are some of my idols, and i have to say i was never, at one time, disappointed. The animation was superb, and the undertaking to attempting to get every scene up to satisfaction(for something is never perfection) was very impressive. The voices for the characters were well chosen and the design and characteristics of the characters was very vivid and real-like. I am going back to see it this weekend, and am sure the movie will be just as enjoyable. Johnny Depp was very interesting to watch mold this character directly from just working on Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and still manage to make this character just enough before falling over the edge. The music by Danny Elfman was again, like always as he tends to pair Burton often, was quite mystical and serenading.",2005
9,"Tim Burton and Johnny Depp? Sign me up for it, anytime! I've pretty much enjoyed their collaborations, from Edward Scissorhands to Sleepy Hollow. Hot off the heals from their box-office success Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, their latest collaboration sees Depp lending his voice to Burton's macabre vision in a stop motion animated movie, along the veins of Nightmare Before Christmas (NBC).",2005
10,"What can I say about this movie, other than that it is completely beautiful? I am truly wowed by the set, and the music was lively and fun, and overall, on the whole, the reason I go to see movies. The film is a little bit of everything- romance, tragedy, action, mystery, horror, that is why it may only seem to appeal to the ""Hot Topic"" audience, and that is not without reason. ",2005
5,"I was looking forward to this movie because I'm a huge Tim Burton fan, the concept is GREAT, and the animation looks fantastically amazing.",2005
7,"People say that Corpse Bride was horribly boring, etc. HOWEVER, that is because they are comparing this nonstop motion picture with Nightmare Before Christmas. Those who were really upset after the movie, saying that 'it's definitely not Nightmare', you are absolutely right. It is not Nightmare. It's Corpse Bride, a completely different movie. Everything was comparison, Nightmare to Corpse Bride, and yes, I'll admit, I enjoyed Nightmare more. However, when going to see this movie, you cannot compare Corpse Bride to Nightmare because then yes, you will be upset. If they had done another Nightmare, they would have done it years ago. But this is a different movie with a beautiful plot when you think more closely about it. It's a very strong plot of love, betrayal, hate, death, etc and you see that very strongly if you listen closely to Danny Elfman's wonderful music, vocal and instrumental. Basically, go into the theaters with an open mind and enjoy and pay attention to the movie because it truly has strong, very strong, meanings. If truly watching and comprehending, at parts you cry and at others you smile. It's very clear that it is beautifully created and the actors match their parts well, but the storyline is simply beautiful. Do not think about Nightmare because that movie has been finished years ago, but enjoy Corpse Bride. I will not give anything away, so I leave my review at that. Enjoy Corpse Bride people! And for others who think I am Anti-Nightmare or something, I am seriously not. I loved and still love that movie, but just enjoy Corpse Bride without judgement until after the movie.",2005
9,"If you listen to a lot of the comments on this site you will probably never want to see this movie and that would be a shame because it is probably one of the best movies of the last couple of years. The thing I like most about this movie is that it transports you back to that glorious time in 70's Venice and that's what a good movie does. Granted, if I were to dig deeper into the facts of the Zephyr team I probably wouldn't like the movie as much because it wouldn't be ""factual."" What I have come to find out is that most movies that are based on a true story always distort the facts but that is irrelevant. This is still a movie, not a documentary. The purpose here is to entertain. I remember Roger Ebert gave ""JFK"" a great review and Walter Konkrite ripped him for it saying the events depicted were not fact based. Ebert responded by saying that the movie captured the nation's collective fears, paranoia, and cynicism about the government since the assassination and that's what a movie is supposed to do. I love the use of music in this movie and how the character's all have to come to grips in their own ways with their new found stardom. The ending is also very emotional and almost poetic. Overall, a fun, nostalgic glimpse into some of the skater's lives and what they did for their sport.",2007
8,"Although there has been much controversy about whether the movie has really portrayed 'Dogtown' and the z-boys accurately, i feel this is not even necessary. If you feel unsatisfied with what you have learnt about the z-boys and Dogtown go and watch Peralta's documentary Dogtown and Z-boys. Lords of Dogtown has the intention of entertainment and i personally exetremely enjoyed it. Lords of Dogtown tells the story of how a group of Venice street kids changed the face of skateboarding (and, to some degree, youth) culture in the mid- to late 1970s. The adolescent adopted the Zephyr Shop, a surf store run by Skip Engblom (Heath Ledger), as their home away from the own dysfunctional homes. Engblom recruited the best skaters for the Zephyr Team. Including: Tony Alva (Victor Rasuk), responsible Stacy Peralta (John Robinson) and troubled bad-boy innovator Jay Adams (Emile Hirsch). With the introduction of urethane wheels (revolutionary for the boys skating style as now the wheels gripped, they could ""climb walls"")and the timely South Cal drought meaning swimming pools were to be emptied, giving the boys perfect locations to practice their gravity-defying maneuvers, Zephyr became the be-all-end-all of the skateboarding scene.",2006
10,"I grew up in California and this movie REALLY brought me back to the 70's and what was happening in the skateboard world. The actors were totally on mark with their portrayals of these guys and how things were back then in California at that time. I'm a girl and I was into skateboarding at that time. I saved my own money to buy my own boards. I even remember my mom came home one day and gave me an article from a magazine about Alva. I met him later in the 80's and he's a very down to earth guy. If you grew up in Cali at this time, you will LOVE this movie and if you didn't you will get the true idea of what it was like then. Awesome job guys on this film! A definite classic!",2007
10,"I will start out by saying that I really do love this movie, but I'm not here to rant and rave about it. This movie is fascinating to me because I do love the skate culture and seeing a movie about characters who started modern skating was, as I said, fascinating. However, I realize that most of the world doesn't think that. With that in mind, I will continue. This movie is not a documentary about skating!!! If you want a documentary then check out Dogtown and Z-Boys directed by a Z-boy himself. It is full of stories about how the Zephyr team came to be and the way life was in Venice Beach at the time. I personally love the documentary as well, but Lords of Dogtown is not meant to be a Hollywood representation of the documentary. If you are looking for that, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!! Lords of Dogtown is meant to be a story about the characters that fills in the gaps the documentary leaves about how these people felt, mainly Jay Adams, Stacy Peralta, and Tony Alva. The camera angles are not straightforward, the cinematography is rough, and its not a cookie cutter film. But that, in my opinion, is why it works so well. A lot of the Z-Boys themselves were on staff for this movie and helped to make it as authentic as it could be while still holding the attention of movie-goers. These guys were very impressed with the way the film was produced and, for the most part, were very pleased with how it represented the time. If you love skate culture then chances are you will fall in love with this movie like I did. Even my parents, who are definitely not into the skate culture or the 70's, still enjoyed this movie and were interested about the documentary afterwards. This movie definitely made me more interested in what skating was all about and I can't get enough about these guys now. I highly recommend this movie as well as Dogtown and Z-Boys.",2009
8,"It was the seventies Sam. Materialism was making a comeback. For poor kids this was a way out of the dead end they saw in their future, so many of them jumped at the chance for a corporate sponsor. Watch the documentary. These were real people. Most of the events happened in some fashion to the team members, but to make it a more cohesive story, Peralta put it into one year and focused on the three main characters for the movie. Put the Dogtown and Z-boys documentary on and watch for how well they all match the mannerisms of the real people they are portraying. They also had to be convincing skating and in some scenes surfing. Watch the movie again with Peralta and Alva's commentary running and you will see and hear how close they got it to the real life these guys had. How can you say Emile Hirsch is one dimensional? John Robinson does most of his own skating. Peralta himself doubles for the multiple 360s in the Delmar contest scene. The real Alva does some as well. I've never even skated, but I lived through the seventies and I thought it was like stepping back into the past. Very convincing. The only thing I would have done differently would be to develop Wentzle's character more-he is a hoot in the documentary.",2006
8,"This was a great movie on friendship in the '70's, and a look at how the sport of skateboarding took off. I'd wanted to see it for awhile, so with Heath Ledger's death, didn't hesitate anymore. I didn't recognize him as the surf shop owner Skip, for the first several scenes. I think he added poignancy to his role, as did others who, in the film, fought their way to who they are. Interesting to know this is based on lives of people still in the skateboarding business, including the man who started off Tony Hawks career. It's good to have work out there yet to see Heath Ledger's talent shine. I'd recommend this movie to people who like to observe people, even if you're neither a skateboarding fan or a Ledger fan.",2008
4,"Stacey Peralta's documentary ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" served as the springboard for ""Lords of Dogtown,"" a fictionalized account of extreme skateboarding's birth.

10,"I am not a fan of surfing or skateboarding (although learning to surf is on my bucket list), but I decided to watch this film due to some of the names on the cast list such as Emile Hirsch, Heath Ledger, and a small appearance by Jeremy Renner. (Heath Ledger... what talent!)",2010

9,"Having been dragged to this movie preview by my 9 year old skateboarding son, my expectations were low. This film was well done, and did not require a dramatic denouement. The biggest surprise was Heath Ledger, who casts off his pretty boy image and chews up the scenery. My 16 year old daughter is going to love it because of the boys, the board-boys will love it because it chronicles the history of the sport, and parents like me will be swept away by the soundtrack alone. I hope this film gets the attention it deserves. My husband had seen the trailer and warned me that I was in for snooze, but I was actually quite engaged the entire time. I am currently putting together a program in Seattle that will pair teen skaters with beginners in exchange for community service hours. Hopefully this film will reinvigorate the sport and draw more attention to the need for decent skate parks in the area.",2005

Many of the people who went to see the movie with me, fell asleep.

The soundtrack KICKS arse & I have to have it!! A bunch of skateboarders attended the screening & added some 'spice' to the event with their comments, applause & attitude. They even got on their boards outside the theatre after the movie!

Stacy some words of advice please stick with Hawk and Margera and some video games don't ever try to direct a remake ever again. Sorry Stacy but this one was the bad one. Strange and I bet Ebert gave this a thumbs up or not but I thought it basically sucked. Like I keep repeating myself because that comment won't change.

5,"rating: 2 out of 4  Director: Catherine Hardwicke Cast: John Robinson, Emile Hirsch, Heath  Ledger, Victor Rasuk, Nikki Reed Screenplay: Stacy Peralta MPAA  Classification: PG-13 (drug and alcohol content, sexuality, violence,  language and reckless behavior-all involving teens)  The problem with Lords of Dogtown lies in its approach to the material.  Written by Stacy Peralta, one of the three ""lords"" mentioned in the  title, the film seems to want to tell a story about rebellion,  teenagers, and skateboarding, but this novel effort is eclipsed by box  office pressures of the Summer film release season. The big wigs at the  distributors don't want an art-house film on their hands during June,  they want high-profile adrenaline charged action that will pull  teenagers in by the droves. This pressure probably led to a neutering  of the original screenplay and the old snip-snip of explicit content  which would make the film R, instead of a profit-producing PG-13.  Consequently, Lords of Dogtown is a ""bleh""-quality sports film that  only brushes the surface of its potential.   Skip (Heath Ledger) is the king of Dogtown, which in reality is Venice,  California. It's the sixties, and surfing in California is a rapidly  growing fad. Skip owns Zephyr surf shop, dedicated to the philosophy of  allowing his workers to surf and work on their own hours and terms,  consequently leaving him with the bills piling up. An idea sparks when  new skateboard wheels arrive at his shop and open up the possibilities  of skateboarding becoming a sport, not a hobby for when the waves are  flat. He decides to start the Zephyr Skate Team. Hired for the team,  among others, are Jay (Emile Hirsch), Tony Alva (Victor Rasuk), and Sid  (Michael Angarano). The only one with a smooth temper and a fair head  on his shoulders, Stacy (John Robinson), is also the only one left out  of the team. But this all changes when Zephyr attends their first Skate  competition. Amping up the tunes and transforming the gymnastic-like  sport into one of style, Team Zephyr lands Jay the bronze and Tony with  a potential gold had he not picked a fight with an opposing coach.  However, Stacy decides to show up without a team and ends up with the  silver, proving his talent to Skip. Now with Team Zephyr complete, Jay,  Tony, and Stacy take on the Skateboarding world and make their way to  the top. But when a reporter from ""Skateboarder Magazine"" does a cover  story on the boys everything changes.   What's so agonizing about Lords is all that it actually has going for  it. There's obviously great potential here, but the screenplay just  never pulls through. Most noticeably, the time period director  Catherine Hardwicke creates is nearly flawless. The soundtrack features  great tunes from the era of sixties hard rock, instead of a cop-out  rap/techno backdrop that haunts many of these period sports films  nowadays. The town of Venice is also stylishly re-created. The sets  achieve the mood of a laid-back surfer town with postage-stamp  developments of a suburbia from the fifties. I found it easy to sink  into Hardwicke's world of Dogtown and believe every inch of it.   Also impressive is Heath Ledger's performance. Even though the  screenplay never completes his story, as it does with the ""Lords"",  Ledger's character is the most convincing. Shaving his Australian  accent, Ledger holds a perfect drunken Californian drawl the entire  film. And of all the characters, his is the most dynamic. His character  isn't bound by the stereotypes the others are. He's pathetic,  motivating, rousing, obnoxious, rewarding, and lovable all at once.  He's essentially human. He's the sort of guy we all know. The guy we  aren't quite sure if we love or if we hate. If for nothing else, Lords  of Dogtown deserves a bit of recognition for Ledger's portrayal of  Skip.  But Skip aside, Lords' characters are flat. Their written as  one-dimensional stereotypes that never grow or react to their  environments. Also, none are all that likable. Even Stacy, the kind  one, is sometimes too kind and eventually ends up abandoning his roots  for fame and fortune. We're constantly being alienated from these  characters because the story never allows us to like or even relate to  them. They're kept the one-dimensional characters they started as, even  if their hair-dos may have changed.   How can a film about the sixties, rebellion, teenager-hood,  skateboarding, and revolution be rated PG-13? Since when was the  rebellious behavior of the sixties a tame subject? Lords of Dogtown  likes to believe it was. They try their best, they really do, but with  a PG-13 rating strapping it down, what chance did it really ever have?  Language is kept absent, sex is suggested but not witnessed, drugs and  alcohol are the same, and mostly, Lords skips around every aspect of  the sixties that made it what it's known for. This castration of  material makes the film disappointingly less believable. And with  one-dimensional characters and some poor acting on the parts of Tony,  Jay, and Stacy, Lords of Dogtown is little more than an afternoon  endeavor for only the most hardcore of skaters.   -Sam Osborn",2005

But my friend got free tickets and, being a poor college student, I went. And I was entertained the entire time. This movie has something for everyone: hot guys, hot girls, skateboarding, surfing, and one of the best soundtracks since Almost Famous. It's also a fun look at the 70s that, like Dazed and Confused before it, filled me with envy of my parents who got to enjoy their youth during that decade of awesome music and rebellious sentiments. I think anyone can find something to like about this movie whether it's the friendship theme, growing up, fame at a young age, the exciting soundtrack, the surfing, or the skateboarding.

They invented skating empty swimming pools which eventually lead to vert skating being invented.

8,"The Wedding Date is an excellent date movie. You can't help but empathize with the characters in this ""Pretty Woman"" type movie. The two main cast members are a perfect match for each other. More than just a romantic comedy, it is a good people movie in which you can visualize yourself (or someone you know) embodied in one of the cast's believable characters. There are several belly laughs peppered with a few moist-eyed moments making this a very good movie for teens and the young at heart, regardless of age. Granted, it may not be nominated for any academy-type awards, but it rates high marks as a delightful people's choice contender. The movie's entertainment value is clearly worth the price of box office admission. I left the theater giggling to myself...",2005
1,"There have been so many many films based on the same theme. single cute girl needs handsome boy to impress ex, pays him and then (guess what?) she falls in love with him, there's a bit of fumbling followed by a row before everyone makes up before the happy ending......this has been done many times.",2007

Like critics say, it was predictable. But the movie ended exactly like I wanted it to so I wasn't disappointed at all. I left my boyfriend in front of the TV drinking beer and watching the superbowl with his buddies. Hey, if men can have a fantasy world to escape in to, so can I.",2005
10,"I want see this movie again. After reading some reviews, I had my doubts, but I have to say that I had a good time watching Wedding Date. I found myself laughing throughout the movie, and Mulroney is absolutely hot. Messing is perfect as Kat. They have great chemistry. The writing is smart and fun. I liked how the story unfolded, and the pace was just right. Wedding Date has a few twists and turns to keep it from being another formula flick. The story and characters are refreshing and different enough that it doesn't mimic other movies for me. The English countryside is beautiful, and the other scenes added a romantic touch too. I liked the decor of the her parents' home and her old bedroom. It complimented the romantic theme well and made me look. Any romantic will enjoy this fun and sexy romp.",2005
9,"that is what i am and that is what this movie is. I don't think it is supposed to be a profoundly deep movie. This is a very welcomed break from the good, but overdone dramas of the day. I love them, but who doesn't like to see a guilty pleasure movie every now and then? This movie can cure the worst attitude and your craving fora good chick flick. It is very funny and the clichés they use are used to please the audience and the characters. so, i mean give it up, sit back, and just enjoy this very awesome movie.",2005
6,SPOILERS THROUGHOUT.,2005
8,"This movie was soooo cute!!! It was one of the better romantic comedies that I've seen in awhile. I much prefer Dermot Mulroney in this movie than in My Best Friend's Wedding with Julia Roberts. While the movie did have a very simple plot it was made totally enjoyable by the wacky cast of characters and great one-liners that they tossed out. It highlighted how families can put the 'fun' in 'dysfunctional'. It also had some very good serious moments between father and daughter, and man to man. The movie was about a wedding, and like weddings it encompasses both endings and beginnings. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves to laugh and loves happy endings.",2005
10,"I saw this movie tonight, the night it came out and it was wonderful. The plot of this movie reminds me of A Walk in the Clouds (Debra Messing's first movie). What chemistry between the main characters! Debra Messing's character reminds me somewhat of her Will and Grace character. She is classic,elegant, and beautiful with her style. Dermot Mulroney is sexy and charming. It was funny and romantic and had some really great quotes. The music was fun so you may want to run out and buy the soundtrack after singing out loud in the theater. I loved every minute and thought it was worth every penny.I will buy this movie the day it comes out on DVD.",2005
1,"My roommate and I just got back from seeing this movie and we agree, we've never seen a worse movie in our lives. We're both pretty well versed in films, considering she's been a film minor and I had an internship with a production office last year, and we agree that this movie has absolutely no purpose. To begin it's hard to believe that Kat wouldn't try to make some attempt to tell Nick about her life. Their stories don't even coincide until her ""crazy"" aunt asks what he does and Kat pulls him into a closet to tell him he's a therapist and give him $6,000 in a brown envelope. There is no flow in the movie at all. Its like the writer had all of these ""great"" ideas but had no clue how to put them into a cohesive movie. Kat and Nick know each other for 3 days and all of the sudden they fall in love. This is also after Kat finds out that her sister (who's a half sister even though you don't find this out until half way into the movie) has slept with her ex-fiancé who is her sister's fiancé's best friend (yeah, its that confusing). But the funny thing about this part of the movie is that Kat doesn't get mad at her ex-fiancé or sister, but rather at Nick for not telling her (HELLO he's known her for 3 days, why does he think it matters???) This movie goes from bad to worse as the writer tries to frantically make everyone have a happy ending by the end of the movie...but the subtitles are just sexual and pointless. Honestly, one of the things that I didn't get the most was that despite having supposedly grown up in England neither of the girls had an English accent. It felt like the director wanted a vacation so was like 'Ok, let's shoot this movie in England.' I would never recommend this movie to anyone, and despite a few cute quotes that come from the movie this is a horribly written film and should be banned. And NO I'm not just a bitter unromantic...I cried at Hitch and the Notebook and I just appreciate well done films.",2005
1,"One wonders why anyone would try to rehash successful movie plots that have already been seen, like it's the case with this movie. ""The Wedding Date"" is one of the best examples of why not to even try to remake, under the guise of a new story, something that should have been let alone. If a project like this goes ahead with the studio big honchos' approval, then go all out with big stars and glossy production values, that way, people will come for the stars.",2006
1,I had to visit the bathroom on 3 separate occasions within 1 hour after seeing this movie. My guts were in turmoil after watching such an idiotic and insulting travesty of a romantic comedy. The movie was so dead and moribund in atmosphere that my girlfriend fell off the couch while watching it and slept there on the floor until morning. I did not laugh once during the whole movie and I had to drive 5 miles across town to go to the video store to complain and to get some decent comedy urgently. Dermot Mulroney was so bad in this movie that I truly believe he was trying to sabotage the whole sordid affair. The movie has turned me off love and sex and the British for life. I feel like moving to a monastery and maiming myself. Please pray for me and for any poor souls who see this monstrosity.,2006
9,"Looking at the breakdown of the voting on this movie, it's clear that it really appeals to some people, and not at all to others. So I guess the best rule of thumb if you're considering seeing it is: if you like this ""type"" of movie, go for it. If you're not a chick flick person, just don't bother.",2005

8,"was able to catch this movie yesterday. i like Debra messing from will and grace and wasn't really sure if she could carry a movie (since she really hasn't had a lead in a while). Anyway, i think she did a great job and i didn't think of her as grace at all while watching the moving. Dermot Mulroney was quite and not to mention easy on the eyes, what a hottie. the movie started out a bit slow but had good one liners that were funny and kept your eyes on the screen. Sarah Parish was hilarious and kept you wondering what she was going to say next. i agree that i was not particularly sure why the weeding took place where it did and just stop trying to figure it out since the scenery was awesome. all in all i'm a sucker for romantic comedies so i say an 8 out of 10.",2005
1,"Why oh why do good actors accept parts in such garbage? Minor plot goofs such as sending his ticket by messenger when they were going to meet at the airport anyhow, transporting thousands of dollars in cash etc I could accept but the whole concept was too ridiculous for words. Debra is undeniably pretty but straight hair does not flatter her and why would such a flat chested girl try to attract attention to her lack of assets in that department? being at a loss to waste more words on this item I can only repeat myself as follows: Why oh why do good actors accept parts in such garbage?

10,"I took my husband to see this movie. Despite his whimpering of being drug to a ""chic flick"", we both enjoyed this movie very much. My husband even says he can't wait for it to come out on video so that we can buy it. In addition to the hilariously funny yet romantic plot, Dermott Mulroney is smoking in this film! I always thought he was sexy, but he put the icing on the cake in this one! (major source of eye candy) We would recommend this movie to ANYONE!!!! This has got to be one of the most romantic films that I have seen thus far. It will definitely keep you laughing and sighing at the same time. This is definitely one I want for my home video library!",2005
1,"Seriously, I'm all for gooey romantic comedies and will get sucked into Miss Congeniality as easily as Goodfellas...but this movie? It doesn't make any sense!!!! And I'm not even talking about the willing suspension of disbelief kind of not making sense. Why does her family live in England? Or, at the very least, why doesn't she have a British accent? She's sure cozy with her dad and he's surprisingly forgiving of her not being around for the last two years. (On that subject, no one ever makes much of a deal about her being away for so long). And what was with the goofy outfits at the bachelorette party? I'm not even going to get into the fact that the escort she paid for falls in love with her--that could've been overcome by better movie-making. I'm just saying that the characters, the setting, and the plot aren't fleshed out enough to make an even somewhat cohesive story. Oh, and the worst part, in my opinion, is the filmmaker's consistent use of the most unflattering angles on Deborah Messing's nose--I'd have sued the filmmakers if I were her! I mean, honestly, I'm all for women being who they are, but why, in seven loyal years of Will and Grace viewing, have I not ever noticed how incredibly odd her nose is? Oh! Because those producers are kind to her! This movie, like my other least favorite movie ever, Armageddon, is the fault of the filmmakers, not the actors. I can see both Messing and McDermott in these roles with a better writer, director, and producer.",2006
1,"I looked forward to this movie for a long time. The previews made it seem like a cute, fun flick, so I excitedly got a group of girlfriends together to go see it. When I saw it, I was horrified. The acting was horrible - flat and sometimes the audio didn't match - and I found it difficult to become engaged with the characters. The plot seemed stale and did nothing to draw me in. There was no suspense. There was absolutely zero chemistry between the leads. It was hard to tell when the characters started ""loving"" one another. I wasn't expecting this to be an Oscar-worthy movie, but it was awful for it's genre. This movie fails even to reach chick-flick standards.",2005
1,"Shame I can't give 0.5 out of 10, and that's just being charitable. Never in my 47 years have I watched a movie where I felt such contempt for the two lead characters. To say they lack charisma is putting it mildly - what is the opposite of charisma now .. repulsion? ",2009
1,"I am amazed that someone actually thought ""hey let's release this to the public so people can pay money to come see it."" It is truly bad. Debra Messing and the other female actors are horrible: I do not believe them in their roles. Also, while it seems like a good idea, is not developed. You do not get attached to the characters. And it just goes from I hate him to I love him to fight so quickly. You never feel like they are in a relationship. It needed a lot more to develop the plot. There are some redeeming qualities: Dermot is hot, but his character is not developed enough to make you care. Horrible writing and horrible editing. Save your money.",2007

As a huge fan of The Wire, I am glad that one does not have to judge the merit of a programme in terms of how it rates against another. Suffice it to say, The Thick Of It succeeds on every level. Not only does it work as a comedy, but it turns out to be a tremendously powerful piece of drama. Full marks to the cast, who give a powerhouse performance that is absolutely staggering. Particular praise must go to Rebecca Front, who I have always admired, but who has produced here an award-winning performance and I hope that she does receive recognition for this. I could mention every actor who has appeared in the series, they are all wonderful. If you have not seen this show, do so and follow it to its amazing climax.",2009

10,"I am mortified that I have only just picked up on this wonderful series in the past 6 weeks!! I had read that it was good but felt I couldn't commit to another ""must watch"" TV series. However against my better judgement I recorded one programme to see what all the fuss was about. I was totally blown away by the whole thing. I never really rated Peter Capaldi before this but the guy is a genius!! His intimidating, foul-mouthed character is some creation!! Whether it is him or Ianucci that is responsible, I do not know, but the end result is pure gold. Of course lots of viewers are going to find the bad language hard to get past but it really is worth it. I am rarely shocked by bad language but it shocked me - at first I found it gratuitous and almost switched off. However when you get into it the language seems (for the characters) just right and very funny. Who knows if this is the way that the people behind the scenes speak but it works. I actually know someone involved in politics on the Tory side (not my preference) and can believe in the Thick of It characters totally. I am addicted top it already and am about to get the series I have missed on DVD. Brilliant is not the word for it. People who berate the camera-work need to get a life. It is not my favourite style either but it works for this. If you have not seen it make a point of getting it immediately!!",2009
8,"It is difficult to find comedies that elicit genuine laughter these days and The Thick Of It distinguishes itself. A cold open format demands attention right away before the humor seeps in; by the time you realize what your gut is in for, the crays in Department of ""Social Affairs"" have crept their way into your system. Every preemptive political misstep creates so much hysteria and disaster it's impossible for bystanders not to find amusement in the absurdity and idiocy of it all.",2013
10,"In the thick of it is what you would get if you mixed the office with yes minister. shot as a documentary (like the office) it's about the office of social affairs and how they get in and out of trouble every week with hilarious results. Hugh abbot (Chris Langham) is pretty much the Dave Brent of it all while his sidekicks, Olly, Glen and Terri are pretty much there to take the blows for him. The show isn't for everyone because the humour is really dry but if you are a fan of the now modern day British sitcom then this is the most intelligent of the lot. witty dialogue, superb acting, and brilliant originality gives this underrated sitcom a 10/10.",2006
10,"Not only is this a hilarious TV show, it is also a strangely addictive. Armando and his team have written one of the greatest and funniest scripts of all time. Peter Capaldi is frighteningly good as Malcolm Tucker it just seems to get funnier every time you watch it. Easily the funniest TV programme I've ever seen. You need to watch each episode at least two times to get all of the jokes. It seems as though the episodes get better and better every time. Series 1 is good but series 2 is brilliant and it just progresses from then on. I wand lent the box set by a friend and after watching the first episode I became completely addicted and watched every single episode within a couple of weeks. The whole cast is fantastic and it is brilliantly rude. This is quite passable the greatest TV show ever made. Brilliant! Easily better than the Simpsons or anything else like that. It is educational, addictive and absolutely hilarious!",2014
10,"I discovered The Thick of It after somebody suggested I watch In the Loop. This series is pure gold: Edgy, raw and totally believable. Peter Capaldi is a force of nature as Malcolm Tucker! His ability the rip a person apart and yet get them to buy-in with ideas is a work of art. The character of Malcolm Tucker ranks up there with TV characters like Archie Bunker as one of the most memorable in history. The rest of the cast (Chris Addison, Joanna Scanlan, Rebecca Front, James Smith etc) have the daunting task of keeping up with Peter. Not only do they keep up, they make it possible to the chaos that is Malcolm Tucker possible. Brilliant from top to bottom! In a way the limited number of episodes, at first, seems like far too little. But after watching the series again (and again), offering more would be indulgent- Leave the audience satisfied!",2014
10,"Now that I've got that off my chest...no, really, I've known more than my share of real-life sadistic soul-murdering bastards along the lines of Malcolm Tucker who use their workplaces as their personal dungeons, which is why I avoided this series like the plague until a couple of months ago, when a friend convinced me it was essential viewing for Capaldi watchers. I do think it's a measure of Capaldi's talent that in a similar manner to what Anthony Hopkins did with Dr. Lecter and Hugh Laurie with Dr. House, he succeeded in making an essentially repulsive character into something relatable, even something of a folk hero. The ethics of doing so is another matter, as we live in an era where the ability to crush other humans without turning a hair is the most highly valued talent of all, which is why characters like this play so well with 21st century audiences. But Capaldi had to do something while he was waiting for his chance to play the Doctor, which one season in to Doctor Who is clearly the role he was born for, and Malcolm's not bad as roles go, sort of Capaldi's generation's equivalent of Ian Richardson's in ""House of Cards,"" with his vulgar catchphrase ""Come the f!@# in or f!@# the f!@# off"" equivalent to the aristocratic Francis Urquhart's ""I couldn't possibly comment.""

10,"It is fabulous but definitely not that funny. We must not imagine but realize we are governed by this kind of social climbers, this kind of social egotistic selfish egocentric psychopaths who only try to capture some power, not really for the power of it, or at the most the power it provides them with over their direct employees, their direct associates, their friends who are friends as long as they are useful. These people have no vision whatsoever. They can advocate a solution today and exactly the reverse on the following day. They can be gross and pretend they are dainty, or just plain liars and let you know they are suffering so much because they told a lie because they could not avoid telling such a lie because otherwise their wives, husbands, spouses, boy or girl friends, plain friends, children pets or even gold fish, or whatever, would have suffered in a way or another if they had not changed positions and convictions during the night and over the week end. Then you end up wondering why they are in their position of power, who in hell elected them, and you suddenly realize you elected them by not voting at all or by wasting your vote on a marginal side-kick candidate. After seeing such a perilous voyage in the stormy waters of political intrigue and the schizophrenic superman complex, you can only finally decide to vote for the good side next time. But is there a good side? Can we vote for Head without seeing that Head entails Tail, or vice versa? The only thing that changes in these people are not the teeth but the dentures. They all bite abundantly with steel or gold but always with gusto since for them the public is a piece of meat and the media are the pepper and the salt of the barbecued beef.",2009
7,"I had heard many positive reviews about the this British series, especially about the cast and the inventive and frequent swearing, and to be honest I think that's mainly why I wanted to try it before seeing the spin-off film In the Loop, so I did, from writer Armando Iannucci (The Day Today, Alan Partridge). Basically it is a satirical look at the inner workings of modern British government, in the fictional Department of Social Affairs and Citizenship, with blundering minister Hugh Abbot (BAFTA and British Comedy Award winning Chris Langham) heading the department, who tries to do the right thing in situations, under the watch of aggressive Number 10's highly aggressive and domineering enforcer Malcolm Tucker (BAFTA and twice British Comedy Award winning, and three times BAFTA nominated Peter Capaldi), other characters include junior policy adviser Ollie Reeder (British Comedy Award nominated Chris Addison), senior special adviser Glenn Cullen (James Smith) and civil service press secretary Terri Coverley (Joanna Scanlan), the third series saw Abbot replaced by new head Nicola Murray (BAFTA and British Comedy Award winning Rebecca Front). Also starring Olivia Poulet as Emma Messinger, Vincent Franklin as Stewart Pearson, Will Smith as Phil Smith and Roger Allam as Peter Mannion. I can't really write a full review on what goes on, because all the politics stuff going on is to me is a bit mumbo jumbo and I can't always make much sense, I realise obviously it is conflicts between politicians, party spin doctors, advisers, civil servants and the media, and characters are cocking things up and that, but for me the best reason to watch the series is for the characters and swearing, Capaldi is fantastic always being in a huff and swearing every few minutes if not seconds, and Addison is a good bumbler, but also it is clever because although there is a script most of the dialogue is improvised by the cast, so it is a certainly a worthwhile political comedy. It won the BAFTAs for Best Situation Comedy (twice) (also twice nominated), and it was nominated for Best Writer, Best Writer: Comedy and Best Editing: Fiction, it won the British Comedy Awards for Best New TV Comedy, and it was nominated for Best TV Comedy and Best TV Sitcom (twice). Very good!",2014

Yes, you have to suspend your disbelief during some of the action sequences, but I don't remember people complaining about the lack of realism in the Indy Jones or ""Romancing the Stone"" series. The dialogue (especially the buddy banter and William H. Macy's character) is amusing, the plot easy to follow despite its complexities, and the action virtually nonstop. I also found it refreshing for the sidekick to look like a doofus, but actually more than hold his own during crunch time.",2005
8,"I was pleasantly surprised to see how fun, fast-paced and witty this non-R rated movie came out. Beautiful scenery and Indiana Jones-like action mixed with humor and drama. Great film. I wish there were more films like this that lack the need for explicit sex, violence, drugs or swearing to get noticed. I believe strongly in movies that contain the aforementioned elements and are for adults; it's just sad to see few family films that don't involve animated cookie-cutter characters. Nice jobs by both Zahn and Cruz. The supporting characters were likable and not too cliché. Admittedly Zahn has fallen into a role of the crazy side-kick, but in this film I think he finally finds the balance of kooky and serious in the way a action movie ""buddy"" should.",2005

Matthew McConaughey handles the limited demands of his role quite well. Penelope Cruz brings her ever-present charm and beauty to a role which is notable for being one of the few action-adventure roles written for a female that is not obnoxious in recent memory. You can't take your eyes off William H. Macy whenever he is on screen in ANY movie. He's that good.",2005

The cast lineup is excellent for the over-30 demographic, the production values are remarkably good, and the soundtrack just rocks with an eclectic lineup of tunes that really put a person in the mood for action. And after all, Clive Cussler is all about pure, escapist action -- no more, no less. Steve Zahn gives us lotsa larfs to boot. So guys, sit back with a tall one of your favourite beverage, hit the mute button on the discerning part of your brain, crank up the audio, and enjoy a great 2-hour ride with Sahara.",2010

But since we all know now that they're together...I find it amusing. Good for them!! The location shots for this movie are phenomenal, esp Morocco. I'm bringing ALL my Moroccan friends to the movie when it is released. It's similar to National Treasure, but not as slick. There was more sarcastic humor throughout National Treasure, but there's great buddy chemistry in Sahara. I HOPE that Steve Zahn & Matthew McConaughey do a sequel or at least another movie together.

While there is no proof for such an argument either way, Breck has proved to be not much worse than other directors. In fact he did better than most and worse than some. Sahara is best described as a typical entertaining adventure in the vein of Indiana Jones or perhaps National Treasure. It has a tough good guy (McConaughey), a funny sidekick (Zane) and admirable eye-candy (Cruz). Now I admit that most things are quite shallow, but if you mix all of the above mentioned ingredients with a decent story, good action sequences and throw in the fact that there isn't one nanosecond of corniness in this movie, you inevitably end up with a crowd pleasing blockbuster.",2005

10,"Having seen the film cold, without any pre-knowledge of the plot, or without seeing any reviews, this film is far, far better than the average credit given in reviews. The plot is very wide-ranging and develops atmosphere and intrigue in the first 40 minutes. The action scenes are stunning, real edge of seat scenes and the final 90 minutes had me unable to leave my seat in case of missing anything vital. The 'plague' becoming a toxic effect was intriguing. The dictator cold-bloodily killing the doctor's colleague was as chilling a scene as ever could be imagined. The military run Mali was a surprise, given its location. Once the action started, it was very fast paced and never predictable. In retrospect, some of the characters seemed indestructible, but one could never be sure during the film. Yes some of the action was far-fetched, but often quite humorous!!! Again, are any of the James Bond or Tom Cruise films anything but far-fetched!!! To me, the plot has been very well put together, and like the Bond films may well differ from the book, for cinematic effect. I think it is very well acted, very well-produced and has its own genre, 'similar' to the Jewel or Indiana Jones films. The characters are different, which is an added advantage. The lead actor Matthew McConaughey is a pretty tough character, and his comrades/ compatriots have a softer and often more humorous side to their nature. the romance is not over-played, and Penélope Cruz plays the World Health Organisation (WHO)doctor (Not doctor who!)role demurely and extremely well. It's a shame for various reasons Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels won't at present be figuring in any sequels. Sahara did well at the box offices, despite critics efforts to deride the film. This speaks volumes about the film's depth, excitement and audience appeal!!! It does succeed, and who would take it too seriously!!",2007
7,"Matthew McConaughey has developed into one of the bigger action/adventure stars over the last decade and its with films like Sahara that he's gotten that reputation. Thirty years ago I could have seen Clint Eastwood doing a film like this, sixty years ago it could have been John Wayne.",2010
6,"This movie is definitely not a masterpiece. The screenplay is dumb. The acting is to say the least, average. The story is preposterous. Yet, as Ebert nicely put it, ""I enjoyed this movie on its own dumb level, which must mean (I am forced to conclude) in my own dumb way"". Yes, this is a film you should watch with your brain switched comfortably to the 'Off' position, a nice cold beer on the table and a bag of popcorn in your lap. When you come to think about it though, isn't that what movies are supposed to be all about in the first place?",2007

9,"I've been reading the books since I was nine or ten years old, my first having been Atlantis Found and which still remains my favorite to this day, followed by the entire collection of Clive Cussler's amazing books. I've been saying for YEARS that this series needed to be made into a series of movies, one for nearly every book. When I finally heard that in fact a movie, based on the book Sahara, was finally in production, I nearly died and went to heaven. It had been a good six years since I had read the corresponding book, but I still remembered it somewhat.",2006
9,"It was very untraditional, according to what I know about desert action movies. It proves that there is still some new things left in this world for the average cocky, young, heroic adventurer to discover and do something about. It also has the A-Team's ability to roll with the punches, both physical and metaphorical. In others words, to work with what fate, chance, karma or whatever holds the BIG cards gives the heroes. (I thought it was REALLY inventive, the way that the two main men fixed up a broken old plane to make a very large windsurfer.) The humor was somewhat strange, and the wit was classic American sarcasm, exaggeration and continual controversy. PLUS: a whole lot of complaining. At least, near the end, it stuck with some of the crucial elements near the beginning that made up the story. Good continuity,(goofs not included.) Yes, all in all, I think a generous 9 out of 10 is a more than adequate judge-mark for this film.",2007
8,"Nice popcorn flick. The acting is good and Matthew McConaughey looks just the part of Dirk Pitt. The rest of the cast is also good. Steve Zahn had the best part I think. The character wasn't that of the typical sidekick and the director takes this into consideration by giving Al as much screen time as Dirk.I read the novel too and still found the film entertaining. There were a couple of scenes which made me laugh in disbelief, but the film needed such stuff. Dirk Pitt, the resourceful adventurer always turns adversity into advantage and this film tried pretty well to depict that. Also, the dialog between Dirk & Al is good. Only thing I felt out of order was Rudi being depicted as a complete nerd. Still makes a good viewing, though it helps not being hypercritical.",2007
10,"If u enjoyed the indiana jones movies u will enjoy this one, no it doesn't have a deep and moving plot, no it doesn't have intense character development, no it's not a boring arty farty film where u feel like slitting your wrists to escape the boredom of the two hour 'action shot' of some guy adjusting his umbrella. Its good mindless fun and action. I've read some ppl commenting that the disease in the film should have been AIDS instead of the toxic water thing, but action movies are not much fun when they involve ppl driving through informal settlements throwing condoms at the residents. This movie is not meant to highlight the aids epidemic, the poverty in Africa or any other humanitarian/political/social issues ANYWHERE, its about some action and humour and chance to escape reality for a while. I notice as well that most of the posters who have negative comments seem to have a movie making background or liberally throw in references to art films, well the movie isn't aimed at your idea of a good movie (thank god).",2006
10,"I have to admit, I had not heard of Sahara before today. (Why was that I wonder?) I rented the DVD tonight and was quite pleasantly surprised by the entire movie. It was fun, well-done, and well thought out. It was obvious that much complex detail went into making the movie a success by a seeming army of people. I particularly enjoyed the combination of Steve Zahn and Matthew McConaughey. They would not have been a duo I would have thought of, but seemed to have a very apt chemistry that worked. Overall, I really enjoyed this movie and would highly recommend it. If I were trying to place it within a genre and compare it within that genre, I would place it within the genre of epic adventure movies such as the Indiana Jones series and would note that it is equal in scope and success.",2006
7,"I expected nothing from this movie and was pleasantly surprised, even refreshed. All of the characters had a reason to be where they were, even the female character. Her mission is actual more compelling than the lead's. The sidekick, Al (Steve Zahn), is not just a buddy along for the ride. It's clear that the lead wouldn't be able to do what he does without him. Beside, Zahn is just damn funny.",2005

Many scenes had my son at the edge of his seat. He has a wild imagination and enjoyed seeing a movie about a boy with a similar imagination. Taylor Dooley is adorable, and Taylor Lautner has some great moves in the movie. I asked my son for a quote about the movie: ""It is exciting, adventurous, and the 3-d effects could have been a little better, but if it wasn't 3-d it wouldn't be good at all"". It's a kids movie and my kid liked it, maybe yours will too. I",2005

Everything inside of me, everything in me that loves Shawshank Redemption and Vertigo and Raging Bull and all these great great great classic movies tells me that Sharkboy and Lavagirl was awful. And it was. Drastically awful. And I enjoyed almost every minute of it. Let me try and explain it this way - I have written ongoing lists of the greatest films ever made, and the worst films ever made, and Sharkboy and Lavagirl is the only movie I've ever seen that has gotten a placement in both lists for me.",2006

But, it captures the messy, gritty, disjointed, weird, raw, non-linear, funky, wild, whimsical, internally inconsistent world of true childhood fantasy better than any film I can remember. The story is based off the ""dreams"" and stories of the director's then 7 year old son. As a mother and teacher, I can tell you that while the characters and situations are unique, they are also completely representative of the types of stories and imagination games that I have heard again and again.",2006

The stupid lava-freak has identity issues and the ugly shark kid is a violent, rabid freak who needs some medication or something.",2008

I think Taylor Dooley has a great smile and I hope this movie won't be an end to her acting career. My son lost interest in the movie before it was 1/2 over. We saw it in 2-D in a home theater (DVD). From the other reviews I have read, we didn't miss a lot with regards to the 3-D. The plot was a cross between a never ending story and a never ending story. My son still loves the toy though.

1,"this movie was conceived by a child and after less than 5 minutes of watching it, you can tell. i'm sure its target demographic of 6-10 year olds will love it because it has bright colors and kids as the lead actors, but that in no way makes it a good movie. by the way, the son of the director (whose idea the movie was) was 8 at the time the movie was released. movies like the shrek trilogy are also targeted to younger audiences but are very enjoyable for adults too because they have good writing, a good plot, and a great cast. this movie has none of those things. it does have a decent director, but that doesn't help a movie that is lacking in every other major film category.",2008

If forced to watch it, anyone would do anything or say anything just to be spared. I think the acting was horrible by all who was in the movie. I would like to say something more positive about this movie but I can't seem to think of anything. As with most kids my daughter will watch it many times over, she doesn't ask me to watch it with her anymore. My daughter absolutely loves it though and it is geared toward kids so I guess in that respect it should be rated higher but not by me.",2005
4,"A colorful and occasionally imaginative film, The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl (In 3-D!!!) is an overall disappointment, a movie that had good intentions at the beginning, but devolved into a cheesy ""message for our youth."" The movie revolves around Max (Cayden Boyd), the picked-on grade school student who would rather create his own world rather than live in the real one. Of course he's picked on by class bully Linus (Jacob Davich), of course his parents are always fighting (David Arquette and Kristin Davis), and of course Max lives life as a miserable school student who has very little going for him. Writer/director Robert Rodriguez formulated the entire movie, from story to special effects, based on inspirations provided by his children. There are reasons that most movies, even the bad ones, are not made by children. The movie is well meaning, but relies on too many familiar story devices: class bullies, mean teachers, quiet kids who save the day. We've seen this movie before, but the colorful, Super Mario-Mushroom Kingdom-like worlds that inhabit the movie does add some to the entertainment value. Max is taken to his dream world, known as Planet Drool, by Sharkboy (Taylor Lautner) and Lavagirl (Taylor Dooley), the two superheroes of the world. Each superhero contains some depth, not as much as the superheroes in The Incredibles, but the nice little subplot of each character trying to find their place in the world was a nice touch. For instance, after one difficult scene to watch, we now know Sharkboy cannot rap well at all. Otherwise, the characters are each have one note. George Lopez hams it up, most likely intentionally to offer a cheese element to this movie, but I found his characters to be annoying. The movie's plot lacks any imagination, and the world of Planet Drool does feature some creativity, but not enough to save an otherwise pedestrian family feature. This movie is Rodriguez's second foray into the 3-D genre, and though I did not use the 3-D glasses while viewing the movie, the scenes accenting the technology are pretty obvious to the casual observer and distract from the overall viewing experience. I really enjoyed the visual style Robert Rodriguez employed in Sin City, and that movie may have even been enhanced with a few 3-D moments, but Sharkboy and Lava girl was a move in the opposite direction for the maverick director.",2005
1,"This is the most awful and boring kids movie in the history of kids movies. It's about some kid named Max(Rosie O'Donnel is more convincing than him) that has stupid fantasies of superheros that are bad actors. It's a rip-off of Wizard of Oz and Peter Pan, and the only laughs are because of how annoyingly stupid this is. There are several horrid one liners told by Sharkboy(Lavagirl's hair catches on fire and he says, ""Let her cool off some steam"".) Any good reviews that you read of this are from kids 3 and under that learned to type, or mentally disabled adults. David Arquette lends his bad acting to an extremely pointless and brainless part. I had to cringe when Sharkboy started singing an off tune and non sensible song. One of the lines from the song is, ""Go to sleep you little bleep.""....what? What's a little bleep? Also, the 3-D was horrible and was so dark that I could only stand the first 2 minutes of it, then the glasses went off. All the other people in the theater were either sleeping or putting guns up to their heads if the movie didn't end in a minute. Don't see this horrible movie ever. After you see it, you'll be depressed.",2005

Talk about over-indulging your child... ""Dad, I've got a GREAT idea for a movie, and by the way, I want to star in it!!!"" How this one ever got made will be a mystery to me. I know that the whole point of a kids movie is to please the kid, but come on, please! There have been LOTS of kids movies, that while they weren't that great, were pleasant to watch.

1,"I saw this movie in 3-D, and I have to say, I was extremely disappointed. The movie's special effects were terrible, you could tell that everything was CG, they obviously didn't put any effort at all into the animation. The plot was terrible, Sharkboy and Lavagirl's suits looked like they were made out of plastic (which they probably were) and it was overall a very childish film. I mean, really, a banana split boat? Who came up with the idea for this film? A six-year-old?",2009
9,"I saw this film at a sneak preview the other night not knowing what to expect. To say the least I was pleasantly surprised. Film Noir being one of my favorite film genre's, ""Brick"" follows the same story structure, odd-ball characters, right down to the very smart and quick paced dialogue of a 30s/40s hard boiled detective thriller. The twist that lifts it above parody and even a mere homage is the presentation of these elements with high school kids in Southern California. The direction by Rian Johnson is very expert and confident in telling the story, giving the audience smooth and quick editing along with skewed and distorted camera angles. He manages to maintain suspense throughout the film, only in a couple of parts letting it drag (the scenes with the Drama Queen are some of the weakest). The actors are great, the most memorable being the ""villains"" Pen and Tugger. Rather than just being atypical baddies, their portrayals give them depth, sympathy, and at the same time a degree of likability. Kudos also goes to the actor who played Brain, the partner of Frye, who is nearly flawless in his somewhat small role. John Shaft himself, Richard Roundtree, shows up as the Vice Principal, but it is obvious they only had the budget to hire him for one day. I have to say this isn't a classic film by any means; I merely decided to give it such a high rating because it attempts something different and succeeds fairly successfully. I've been tired of the mundane films that get released every year, and for once this is something that is completely different; the use of archetypal characters in the setting and delivery not expected. It's a low budget film, but it is obvious to me that that this filmmaker will be heard from again. Keep an eye out.",2005

9,"OK...I have never actually commented on a movie on IMDb, but this movie was so great I really felt I had to let people know about it. When I first read the synopsis of Brick at Sundance I was immediately interested in seeing it. ""Film Noir set in a high school."" I started hearing really terrible reviews of it and almost did not go until the very last day I could. I am so glad I did. It is a very unique film, such a refreshing one for people who have seen it all. So if you want something new and different you will definitely enjoy this. Others may find it is too over-the top for them--it took me several minutes to understand what the characters were even saying at first, in their language that mixed old film noir slang with the new generation of slang. Its very dark and the sound design will even make a person feel uneasy. The director linked sound and image in ways I have never seen, completely enthralling me from beginning to end. This movie is not a relaxing ride. oh! but there are great comedic and ironic moments as well! I think a lot of the criticism I heard of this film was that it was too incomprehensible and unbelievable. I personally really got into the world of this film and it had me on the edge of my seat until the very end. It was so enjoyable to buy into the rules of the film noir/high school drama world and its characters. I did not even recognize the lead character as that kid from 3rd Rock until the end! I hated 3rd Rock, but I absolutely loved and believed in his character here. I loved it! One of my top picks at Sundance this year. sorry I have never written a review...I hope this reveals something about the movie. I really, really hope that it gets released soon! It is one of those interesting movies that could really be a cult classic.",2005

This isn't just a movie about teenagers and starring teenagers, it looks as if teenagers wrote, produced, directed, filmed and edited it. Kids with a video camera could have made a film that looked better. There are way too many holes and credibility gaps in the story and far too many unsympathetic characters. They finally show Brendan in some pain, although he probably should have died from his untended to internal injuries a third of the way into the film, and the ""profoundly moving"" and carefully kept secret revealed at the end was hardly a secret, and not very meaningful. The use of a single key word as a title has become rather annoying, but there is a common street term for excrement used in the movie that would have served just as well.",2006

Watching it brought to mind not only the black & white films of the 40s and 50s, but glimmers of Gus van Sant, David Lynch and River's Edge. What gives BRICK its filmic authenticity (much different from realism) is its language -- the language of Chandler and Hammett, but re-imagined from the lips of contemporary teens.",2006

Excellent tribute to the noir genre, with sort of a Raymond Chandler-esquire slant to the dialog, a sort of hard-boiled type protagonist, and the typical twists, turns and double crosses that come with the territory. All this while taking place within the confines of a modern California high-school social scene. Somehow manages to walk the line of homage, send-up, and original film incredibly well. Parts were edge-of-your seat, parts had me cringing with pain or shock, and parts had me in stitches. Well worth seeing.",2005
1,"This film is nothing more than an example of someone trying to be clever and seriously failing, ending up being smothered by their own pretentiousness. I watched (endured, suffered, was tortured by) this film at the Deauville Film Festival in Sebtember 2005 and I can safely say that this was, without any doubt and by a very big margin, the worst offering that I saw all week and I have to say I've struggled to find anything worse since then, even when I leave the DVD choice to my 10 year old son. The film is dull, turgid, lifeless and shambolic, it provides no interest or excitement and was viewed by myself as a waste of 110 minutes of my existence. If you want to spend some money and waste a few hours, got to a bar, have a few drinks, believe me you'll enjoy yourself more. If looking at glowing images on a faraway wall that offer you no intellectual stimulation whatsoever without any hint or promise of enjoyment then this is the film for you.

10,"That's the story, right? Going back to the days of ""China Town"" with Jack Nicholson chasing lead after lead, turning corners left and right, only to find more corners. Who's duping who? We don't know until the very end in this fast-paced, hipster lingo drenched wild revival of the classic Black and White Film Noir. Joseph Gordon-Levitt (yes, the kid from Third Rock) is a brilliant hero/foil as Brendan, the bitingly dry, quick-witted, scrappy and yet reluctant detective trying to walk his way through a web of lies, more lies, murder and lots of missing drugs. His character is bright, he can read a situation like a psychic on crack, turn things to his favor in seconds and play people as deftly as he is ultimately played himself. ...And he can take a punch. The plot turns this way, then that, keeping you constantly guessing as to where it will take you next. As soon as you think you know what's going on, you don't. Nora Zehetner is a beautiful and beguiling femme fatale. ""The Brian"" (Matt O'Leary), who is constantly feeding Brendan his facts and keeping him on track, knows his stuff but never let's you know how. Rian Johnson has written an amazing script and directed it into a whirlwind experience of near misses, painful betrayal and love/love lost. The lingo takes a second to catch. I'm reminded of Swingers, had it been as thrilling as it was funny. The words fall into place and give the film a slick, quick delivery like the best exchanges between Bogart and Bergman, Alan Ladd and Veronica Lake. Take all that and drop it into a dark, starkly brutal modern world... In a high school, of all places. There's even some quirky humor thrown in, though most of the laughs from the audience were really nervous release from all the tension built into the story. A must see.",2006

Locations are ""no budget"" and ineffective. The movie is not engaging (with 15 minutes I realised this was a major mistake) and at best will make you smile. Characterisation is bad. But all that is just not the real bottom line: it's damn boring and acts as a very long joke in cinematic reference. There is nothing brilliant about unless the whole production was under-aged, which would be admirable.

It's essentially a film noir set in present-day San Clemente High School, reminiscent of ""The Big Sleep,"" but with drug-dealing added to the mix of double-crossing. The characters may be teenagers, but the dialog channels Chandler and Hammett, and my only real complaint with the film is that Joseph Gordon-Leavitt (in an otherwise wonderful performance) sometimes mumbles; this is dialog you don't want to miss. Lukas Haas is wonderfully eccentric in what is essentially the Sidney Greenstreet role, Noah Fleiss as the dumb thug, and Nora Zehetner even LOOKs like Mary Astor.

They are not hard-boiled detectives, they haven't earned the right to be hard-boiled. The filming is so flawed that it's almost impossible to concentrate on what IS going on without being distracted by all the flubs.

It is an unengaging story about an unlikable girl who goes missing, and her miserable ex-boyfriend who tries to solve the big mystery. Yawn. The dialogue is perhaps the most annoying part of Brick. Clearly the writer has mistaken 'incomprehensible' for 'clever'. It's all gabbled nonsense like ""Jimmy C got goosed by the bulls and now I'm half-galloned to Milwaukee. Find out where Eddie Cheerio hides his cake and then meet me behind the Flapjack shop at a quarter past lunch."" Or something.",2006

The dialogue is inaudible. Throughout the entire film, I couldn't focus on the story because I was just trying to figure out what everyone was saying. It was really annoying and so for me the whole film just doesn't work. The film is painful to watch. The film is so predictable, badly acted and ridiculous. It tries so hard to be ""cool"". What a complete waste of my time and money.",2006
2,"When I heard that Brick was a ""film noir set in a high school"", that sounded good. Had I known what it really was, I'd have saved my time and money.",2006
8,Bill Paxton has taken the true story of the 1913 US golf open and made a film that is about much more than an extra-ordinary game of golf. The film also deals directly with the class tensions of the early twentieth century and touches upon the profound anti-Catholic prejudices of both the British and American establishments. But at heart the film is about that perennial favourite of triumph against the odds.,2006
8,"I was extraordinarily impressed by this film. It's one of the best sports films I've every seen. The visuals in this film are outstanding. I love the sequences in which the camera tracks the ball as it flies through the air or into the cup. The film moves well, offering both excitement and drama. The cinematography was fantastic. ",2007
10,"Wow, here is another great golf movie. That's at least three in the past few years that I've really enjoyed, that were well-done, beautifully-filmed and inspirational. The other two were ""Bobby Jones: Stroke of Genius"" and ""The Legend Of Bagger Vance.""",2006
10,"This movie gives golf a high mark, it was well acted and well directed. Giving you a view of history that some non-sports fans will enjoy. The historic factor alone gives it a high rating, the Brookline golf course was really done well. I am in the northeast and have seen Brookline as a fan, and as someone who loves the game. The movie was well done on all levels. A MUST SEE 5 stars. The acting was superb, Disney has another winner in its bag of Great movies. If for no other reason watch the film to give hope and encouragement to young people whom may not see the hope in their life. I would tell you that the setting, while in the late 1800's and early 1900's is very realistic. The costumes and dialect were right on the mark as well. Above and beyond the call of duty for a golf film. A Must see for fans and non-fans alike.",2006
9,"As a recreational golfer with some knowledge of the sport's history, I was pleased with Disney's sensitivity to the issues of class in golf in the early twentieth century. The movie depicted well the psychological battles that Harry Vardon fought within himself, from his childhood trauma of being evicted to his own inability to break that glass ceiling that prevents him from being accepted as an equal in English golf society. Likewise, the young Ouimet goes through his own class struggles, being a mere caddie in the eyes of the upper crust Americans who scoff at his attempts to rise above his standing. ",2005
9,"I saw this film on September 1st, 2005 in Indianapolis. I am one of the judges for the Heartland Film Festival that screens films for their Truly Moving Picture Award.

7,"Actor turned director Bill Paxton follows up his promising debut, the Gothic-horror ""Frailty"", with this family friendly sports drama about the 1913 U.S. Open where a young American caddy rises from his humble background to play against his Bristish idol in what was dubbed as ""The Greatest Game Ever Played."" I'm no fan of golf, and these scrappy underdog sports flicks are a dime a dozen (most recently done to grand effect with ""Miracle"" and ""Cinderella Man""), but some how this film was enthralling all the same.",2005
10,"Although I'm not a golf fan, I attended a sneak preview of this movie and absolutely loved it. The historical settings, the blatant class distinctions, and seeing the good and the bad on both sides of the dividing line held my attention throughout. The actors and their characterizations were all mesmerizing. And I was on the edge of my seat during the golf segments, which were not only dramatic and exciting but easy to follow. Toward the end of this movie, ""Seabiscuit"" came strongly to mind, although ""The Greatest Game Ever Played"" is far less complex a story than that film. In both cases, the fact that the events really happened deepened my interest.",2005
10,"I'm not a sports fan - but I love sports flics! So, why ... what is a great sports flic ... this one. And the storytelling style, is very fine.",2006
8,"I saw this film in a sneak preview, and it is delightful. The cinematography is unusually creative, the acting is good, and the story is fabulous. If this movie does not do well, it won't be because it doesn't deserve to. Before this film, I didn't realize how charming Shia Lebouf could be. He does a marvelous, self-contained, job as the lead. There's something incredibly sweet about him, and it makes the movie even better. The other actors do a good job as well, and the film contains moments of really high suspense, more than one might expect from a movie about golf. Sports movies are a dime a dozen, but this one stands out. ",2005
8,"As you know ""The Greatest Game Ever Played"" is about golf. I used to snicker at the over-dramatic title, but through great visual display credited to director Bill Paxton (better known for his acting in Twister and hilarious supporting roles in Aliens and True Lies) we find out that this has much more meaning than a game.",2005
10,Oh my god what a story! This movie is very good and it had to be God who had this happen! You did a awesome job.The acting was really good you picked the right actors for sure. This movie is so good I am really glad you made this because if you had not then I would have never ever known about this story because I am not a big golf fan and I think it is kinda boring so thank you. I really enjoyed it and that is why I gave the movie a 10\10.I liked Shia Labouf too he was perfect for the roll of Fransis Quimet. I hope most of that stuff you put in there was true also. Oh and some parts were funny and others I was just really happy.,2007

10,I will divide my review into following 5 categories each accounting a maximum of 100%(if perfect) ________________________________________________________________ ,2009
8,"""The Greatest Game Ever Played"" is beautifully done. It is perfect in many (if not all) aspects. A real winner. It is not for everyone though. Most young people will probably be bored by it, I mean golf isn't exactly the most exciting and action packed game ever invented. However, for those with longer attention spans, it is a very good movie that I really enjoyed.",2005
6,"The story is great, the movie is bad. I didn't care for the casting, except for the actor who played Eddie the caddy and the actor who played Vardon.",2006
10,"if you watch this at home on DVD or Bluray! be sure you have great sound system. the musical score through this is what moves you through the movie. I have watched the movie several times and thought it was great but after just up-grading my home theater sound system, what a difference. I will be watching this movie many, many more times.",2009
9,I think this movie is a quality film and definitely worth watching.,2005
8,"Is this movie perfect? Certainly not. Is it cliché? Yes. As you might read in other reviews or comments, the story is ""typical"" of the average sports movie.",2005
6,"Let me go ahead and clear this up - no, The Greatest Game Ever Played is not about the time I led my softball team to victory by knocking in the winning run with a triple. Instead, it's about golf. More specifically, it's based on the book that's based on the true story of Frances Ouimet.",2005
6,Writing a movie script based on Mark Frost's excellent book was no doubt a daunting task; doing a movie about any golf game has to be a challenge. And this rendition of the 1913 US Open was fair but perhaps failed most in not holding to the truth.,2005
3,"I actually trawled through the entire set of reviews, searching for the ones which gave this film less than 5 stars. They were few and far between. Which is utterly baffling! Yes, I know it's a Disney film and it isn't directed by Christopher Nolan, but good Lord. This is straight-to-the-bargain-bucket nonsense. They should've had done with it and animated the bloody thing.",2010
10,"I love golf. I love playing it. I love watching it on TV or in person. There's no other game on earth like it. Just you against the golf course. There may be other players out there, but it's still just you, the course, and that stupid little ball.",2008
10,"hello, my name is Jessica and I'm sending you this e-mail to congratulate you on this movie. i think you have done an awesome job and it is now one of my favourite movies. it is one of my favourite movies because it is a true story, it is an interesting movie and i love golf. since i was about 8 years of age my dad kept saying to me why don't you take up golf as a Hobbie? From this movie i now no that if you are interested in playing golf you should just do it and not sit back and think about it for 4 years like i did. I regret not starting to play golf at the age of 8. now i love golf even more and i play golf for a Hobie. my favourite part of the movie is when the little guy, the short one comes on set. he is also my favourite character. i first heard about this movie at the local video store(video ezy) and i hired it my mum said no so i hired it with my own money. i really enjoyed that movie and again well done on a successful movie.",2007
7,"The Devil's Rejects is not always an easy film to watch. It has a genuine savagery that makes recent films such as Hostel or Saw II, non spectacular though they were, appear rather tame.",2006
10,I went to this movie having seen 1000 Corpses which I thought was a great retro B style horror in the Texas Chainsaw massacre genre. ,2005
10,"Alright, I never bothered with ""House of 1,000 Corpses."" Mainly due to the poor reviews and the fact it looked like a ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" rip off. As a matter of fact I wasn't that interested in this movie at first. But the early buzz raised my interest and I went out and saw it.",2005
7,"I went into a screening of this movie completely blind. I hadn't seen 1000 Deaths, and I haven't even seen any of Rob Zombie's videos. (I do like his music,BTW) I had essentially no idea what to expect.This movie is what ""Natural Born Killers"" *TRIED* to be. It's ""Kill Bill"" without the nod and wink that this is campy/funny. This movie is intense, violent, gory, gritty, harsh chilling and creepy. The only movie/scene that can compare the intensity to is ""Saving Private Ryan"", particularly the scene where Mellish is slowly stabbed by a German near the end of ""Ryan"". This movie can/will take your breath away.",2005

1,"I am a horror fan. There is something about a stylish thriller that I think we all enjoy. However, anyone that appreciates a good thriller appreciates the style, suspense and craft that goes into a worthwhile film. I checked this film out on IMDb before I rented because I hated ""House of 1000 corpses"". Now that I have seen it I am stunned that it got a 7.0. WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE??? This is simply an exercise in sadism. There is nothing enjoyable or suspenseful about cruel, nasty material done in an ugly way. I almost turned the ""movie"" off after the sickening humiliation of Priscilla Barnes, but I figured if I was going to express an opinion I should see the entire movie. What a mistake that was! Everyone involved in this sickening, vile mess should be deeply ashamed. Please...Someone tell me the point of this repugnant pile of self-serving crap! How does this get made??? How does this get financed??? And REALLY, how do you people find anything entertaining about this nasty exercise in brutality??? This ""film"" wallows in its own grotesque ugliness. There is no point, no art, no entertainment, no craft, no suspense and no reason. Rob Zombie has now assembled two of the most pointless, nasty, ugly, vile excuses for a movie ever made. I seriously don't want to be in a room with anyone who really enjoyed this rancid, pathetic piece of trash. There is real craft out there. Seek it out. This is the kind of thing that makes me lose all faith in people. This speaks volumes about how the rest of the world sees us in this country. It is my hope that Rob Zombie will never again have the finances at his disposal to construct another affront to the sensibilities of everyone but the criminally insane. If you are a real fan of horror stay clear of Mr. Zombie's sick masturbatory daydreams and seek out some masters of the craft. I suggest some Dario Argento. I sincerely hope that my comments don't make someone want to see this trash. I can imagine someone thinking ""If it's that bad I have to see what all the fuss is about"". Don't bother. You will just feel like you are covered in a thick slimy film that can't be washed off.",2005
8,"This movie has some classic ingredients for a great horror movie. Interesting characters, some really vile gore scenes, bad language, unnecessary nudity, and some familiar faces; Leslie Easterbrook (from the Police Academy movies), Ken Foree (the original Dawn Of The Dead), 80's pop singer/actress E.G. Daily and Michael Berryman (The Hills Have Eyes) provide more than enough nostalgia for retro junkies, like myself.",2005
10,"I had the pleasure of previewing this movie a few days before its official release. While I enjoyed ""House of 1,000 Corpses"" I think this follow-up sequel was far better. ""House of 1,000 Corpses"" was more like a carnival freak show with supernatural and unbelievable scenarios, whereas ""The Devil's Rejects"" was quite realistic and very brutal. ",2005
1,"OK. I saw ""House of 1000 Corpses"" and thought it an utterly useless, TCM rip-off. But I heard better things about this one, so I went in with an open mind. Unlike Rob Zombie, who does not seem to have an original, or even fresh thought in his head. Otis the crackhead psycho from ""House"" becomes a Charlie Manson wannabe in this one, and Sheri Moon is the least convincing ""bad"" girl I have ever seen.",2006
1,"I think this movie is sick. Was there a ""good guy"" in the movie before the last scene? I doubt it. Although to quasi-quote most of the people commenting on this film ""if you like murder, gore, sadism, torture, brains splattered on asphalt, and women wearing masks made from the faces of their dead husbands, then you'll love this movie."" So I guess the Fireflies are kind of ""good guys"". At least they're heroes. Well, that makes me think the people saying that really think what the heroes were doing in the movie was really cool. Just awesome. I mean, ain't it cool when some guy whacks another guy in the nuts with a big log and then crushes his skull before taunting a guy who's bleeding to death from a bullet-wound in his neck and torturing him? That's a lot of fun. Of course we would never do those things, no. Maybe people are just scared to sound too ""conservative"". Well, wouldn't it be better if people were scared to even let the thought enter their minds that killing is really cool, especially when it's sadistic. Wouldn't it be better if movies showed people what really happens in the lives of murderers like the Fireflies? That it isn't a game that ends heroically with the perpetrators true to each other until the very end (the film does a good job showing the love and dedication the murderers feel towards one another). Anyone who's read info about serial killers know they go through cycles--fantasy, murder, guilt and shame, fantasy, murder, guilt and shame...until it finally gets to them, and they are caught and have nothing to do but confess that they knew full well that what they were doing was wrong. A movie like this could be good if it showed all the horrific psychology behind serial murders. But this one doesn't. It attempts to make you ""feel for"" the murderers; the victims come across as rather stupid; the sheriff who tries to bring the ""heroes"" to justice fails miserably, and it seems the viewer should almost rejoice when he dies, because he's a sick weirdo. But wait a minute, that's what the ""heroes"" are. But the heroes are cooler, they know what their doing, and they're much better at humiliating people. They're pros. I mean, the sheriff is killing for revenge (how lame) but the fireflies are killing for fun (coool!). Otis taunts a decent man who's praying and says he should tell God to send down lightning. God doesn't, and Otis goes on to sarcastically repent. Truth be told, God would not force a man like Otis to repent. If I were the man whom Otis was taunting, I would say. ""Otis, you choose hell. God will not force you to do otherwise."" Otis rejected everything good and bright in the world for a life of hatred and running away. There is nothing good in him. Even those things which would appear good stem from selfishness. He ""loves"" his OWN family. And that's it. The amount of crap he does in the film cover that all up. He chose hell, he chose to do what he knew was wrong and evil. He knew right from wrong, human from animal. He chose the latter in both cases (along with the other members of his family). If you think that's cool, you have a really big problem.",2005
9,"Only certain people can appreciate a movie like this. This was better than Rob's ""House of 1000 Corpes"". It was sleazy, gruesome, and actually funny at times. Otis, Baby, and Captain Spaulding really do make this movie. The crazy thing is that I was actually rooting for them in the end. Maybe this is sick but this is how the movie portrayed them. Come on, Baby likes tooty fruity ice cream. You can't help but to root for her. This movie also had the feeling to it that it was filmed in the 70's. It's hard to explain but it had that Texas Chainsaw, Friday the 13th, The Hills Have Eyes feel to it. All around a great flick for the horror fan who can appreciate it.",2006
1,"sorry, this is not a good film. simply setting up a bunch of people for violent, miserable death and torture, zombie has no tale to tell and no point to make. as far as i remember nobody survives, not that it matters, which seems to be the point of this childish, inept exercise in ersatz nihilism. (actually, i may be wrong there... can't quite recall, but isn't there some hulking deformed fellow who comes to the director's wife's rescue and then... ohh, i really can't be bothered.) a lot of superannuated infants would have one believe that this film is 'sick' and 'depraved' to it's credit. it's not. while it is definitely deserving of both those adjectives it is still no good whatsoever.",2005
1,"The problem with The Devils's Rejects ultimately is that Rob Zombie is a timid bourgeoisie who won't let anything truly shocking get in the way of his calculated investment, and his very deliberate image positioning. The movie lacks the courage of it's p.r. because passing the current boundary of violence (established by other braver projects) might cut into profits. He's a pretty unconvincing salesman for it, and a bad actor. If you like being sold things, you'll like the movie, but the violence isn't shocking despite being the films raison d'etre. In a movie like, say... Blood Simple, the violence is shocking because it anchors a non-violent story at various points. In the Devil's Rejects, there is no story, the violence is there to keep numb, unimaginative viewers stimulated. Gee, that's some rebellion. Much of it performed on the sets left over from Big Fish.",2007
1,"To say that Rob Zombie's film, ""The Devil's Rejects"", is not for everyone would be an understatement. In truth, it's for the very few. Those who will find it worth viewing are most likely already devotees of Mr. Zombie and his former metal band, White Zombies.",2006
1,"I'm guessing that most of the people voting more than 1 star for this movie are teenagers or emotionally retarded adults who think it's somehow cool. To anyone with a double-digit IQ, 1 star is about 1000 times more than it deserves.",2006
1,"There is no reason for this movie except for the insatiable lust for gory stupidity which I share. I am a customer of this slimy fraud so I must have somehow created it, in a roundabout way. I lust for bloody dementia just like the next well-adjusted guy. The bloody protagonists of this sad orgasm of sickness push the boundaries of propriety in a truly thrilling and lurid way. I make this movie exist because I secretly cheer for the evil people who destroy human beings in a deliciously insidious way. I secretly want the bad guys to succeed, so I can expand my cramped attic of normality in any way possible. In sum I am evil. This penny-dreadful is an affront to humanity, yet safe, as an accident I can drive past. This movie slaughters humans like pigs, and I merely file its existence away in the ""too weird"" file in the back of my alleged mind. This movie got two thumbs up from Roger Ebert and His Little Stooge Roeper. Is Roger Ebert on the take, or is he just senile? Next Question.",2006
1,"this film is in my top 3 worst films of all time along with ""Merlin's shop of mystical wonders"" and ""Harvesters"". All three of these films share horrible continuity errors, pointless subplots, and awful directing. Rejects is a stupid film. Clearly you do not expect a deep and philosophical plot... it's a gore movie; but there is not a lot of gore, and a load of crap about satanism. The devil does not even come into it though. Devils rejects is just a nickname for the ""gang"". The sheriff looking for the gang, decides instead to adopt their approach and burn them alive/torture them (one torture is stupidly reminiscent of Jesus being nailed to the cross) instead of arresting them. The rejects are then saved by a random orc, who then proceeds to destroy himself. The film ends with a stupid montage about how great the rejects are - the director clearly forgetting which characters are which.",2006
1,This is the first movie I've seen that I would rate X. Even bare breasts couldn't save this movie.,2009
2,"I have always felt that music (guitar, drums, synth) in Rob Zombies songs sounds spectacular but the lyrics are cartoonish at best. His movies seem to follow the same formula. They look the part, but you just can't take this stuff seriously.",2005
9,"I first saw this on a DVD in 2006. This was way better than its predecessor House of 1000 Corpes. It was sleazy, gruesome, and actually funny at times. Otis, Baby, and Captain Spaulding r the outlaws pursued by William Forsythe (The rock, Once upon a time in America) aka Sheriff Wydell as he is hellbent on revenge. While the first one was in one area n one house mostly, the 2nd one is more outside n on the go. This can b termed as a road/revenge/western movie. Now coming to the clichés usually found in most horror flicks. 1)Characters outnumbering a villain who is only armed with a knife, and yet not making any effort to attack the villain. 2)Waiting forever to steal a gun from the villains, then waiting forever to shoot the villain. 3)Villain is down on the ground but not attacking n giving the villain plenty of time and opportunity to get up n attack. 4)N of course the gun is not loaded. 5)Talking a lot before attacking the villain n losing the opportunity. 6)Crying n running helter-shelter n running straight into the arms of a member not realizing that he is part of the gang. Most of the same star cast r continued in this flick. A new addtion is Ken Foree (Dawn of the dead-both new n ol) n the above mentioned sheriff.",2016
9,"Let me start off by saying I was very, very disappointed with ""House of 1000 Corpses"". It was overly-fast-paced to the point where it seemed like the only people who could enjoy it were those with ADD. It was also suffering from a lack of gore and carnage, something rather surprising from the horror aficionado that Mr. Zombie is. On top of that, it was a complete rip-off of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" (1974), which is a much better film anyway. All Zombie did differently was add neon lights.",2005
9,"Animated movies are usually pretty good but nothing that great to me. However, this one is a ""keeper."" It gets high marks for all the jokes in here, lots of which are adult-style but not sleazy or filled with sexual innuendos, although there are a few of those, enough to make this PG, not G. However, the vast amount of clever lines is the main attraction here.",2006
8,"I don't think that (with the notable exception of one thread here on IMDb) this movie gets enough credit. The animation was darn good, and the humor had me laughing an awful lot. As a comedy this certainly hit the spot. I think if you enjoyed Ice Age, you could certainly find yourself enjoying this film as well.",2006
7,"Robots is probably the most technically amazing computer-animated movie I've ever seen. When you stack it up against a movie like the original Toy Story, it's astounding how far they've come in about 10 years. There is a scene were a drum of tiny ballbearings falls over, and each ballbearing is rendered perfectly. Amazing.",2005
8,"I'll admit that I did not want to see this. I thought the trailers were utter crap. I mean I saw too many robot movies when this first came out. I thought I would only stick with I, Robot, but I was forced to see this. I was pleasantly surprised how good this was, so I bought the DVD.",2010
8,"""Robots"" comes to us from the creators of ""Ice Age"", but trust me- these are 2 very different movies. Rodney is a robot who's grown up in a middle class society. He's a bit rusty, his paint is chipped, his ""parts"" are hand-me-downs, and his father works as a dishwasher for a big-mouthed boss. I think that MANY people can relate to this situation, and in a subtle way, it's totally believable. Rodney is an inventor, and he dreams of making a better life for his family, and becoming something great. This is where his journey begins: on the road to bigger and better things. He finds himself in front of the Bigweld Corporation (to show his inventions), and of course because of his class- is denied entrance. An arrogant robot named Ratchet is trying to take over the company (with help from his retchid mother, Madame Gasket, who plans on turning all lower robots into scrap metal), and nobody seems to know where Bigweld is. With help from his new friends along the way (Fender -voiced by Robin Williams, Piper, Crank, Diesel, Lug, Cappy, Wonderbot, and Aunt Fanny)- it seems that no matter the obstacle, Rodney's life is about to change for the better. His plan: to find Bigweld, and stop Ratchet from destroying all the lower class robots. The visual effects in this movie are astounding! It's clearly a remarkable feast for the eyes. The cities are creative, as are the characters. There is mild , suggestive humor, but nothing terribly offensive. Robin Williams and Jennifer Coolidge (Aunt Fanny) are hilarious in their own right. There are MANY bonus features, including a behind the scenes, interviews with the voice-over actors, and even some games that you can sort through using your DVD player's controller. All in all, you get your money's worth with this movie, and it's enjoyable for the whole family!",2009
7,"Yesterday I was shopping at Target and they had a bunch of movies for seven fifty, Robots was one of them. I never saw the movie before, but I figured it's just a couple more bucks then if I rented it, so I bought it and watched it last night. I have to say that I'm glad I bought it because I really enjoyed it, this was a fun animated movie that got over looked in 2005. It had great actors for the voices, Mel Brooks couldn't have been a more perfect choice, the whole look of the movie is absolutely cool to look at, and the story was extremely original. This is a great film to watch for yourself or with the family.",2007
7,"While Disney and its child Pixar Studios focus on family morals and heartfelt messages in their films (Finding Nemo) and Dreamworks focus on meticulous animation (Shrek I & II), Blue Skye Studios (Ice Age) shifts their focus onto humor  big doses of humor. There is a kind of rewarding simplicity in an approach like that, and it translates well in its animated features, Ice Age most of all. In their most recent installment Robots (2005), some of the humour is lost and instead replaced by wide-ranging gallery of big shot actors like Mel Brooks, Robin Williams, Ewan McGregor, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent and Drew Carey to name a few. The result is a good, albeit forgettable film.",2006
8,"Robots- This film is pure excellence right from the beginning to the fascinating finale, this animation sees Robin Williams at his best. I find that the beginning of Robots drags on a bit, but when he catches the train to Robot City that's where the fun really begins. The scene where Robin Williams character is on the slide thing is one of the best scenes in the movie. My favourite character has to be Fender (I think that's his name)- the one that's always losing his parts. My favourite scene is towards the end when all the good robots are fighting the evil, upgraded robots and Fender is dressed in up like a school girl and belts out Britney Spears number 1 hit 'Hit Me Baby One More Time' while he's bashing the upgraded robots on the head. 8/10 brilliant but not a patch on Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc or The Incredibles.",2005
7,"The first 2005 film I've seen, and, really, it's the only one released so far this year that I have had even the littlest desire to see at the theater. It was worth seeing, but it's forgettable. The visuals are absolutely eye-popping. The film's best sequence is a Rube Goldberg-esque public transportation system across town. I think if that had gone on for 90 minutes, we would have had some kind of masterpiece on our hands. Instead, we get a dull story of a group of nearly outmoded robots rebelling against an evil company that is no longer building spare parts. The head of that company used to be all for the common folk, but he's disappeared and left a despot in his place. The underground area, where they melt scrap, is really cool, and reminded me of The Nightmare Before Christmas. Madame Gasket, who rules this part of the city, was the most interestingly designed character. Robin Williams is very annoying, but, to his credit, he is playing a character here, not just himself. I wasn't thinking ""Man, is Robin Williams annoying,"" but rather, ""Man, that character Robin Williams is playing is annoying."" I doubt that could be taken as much of a compliment, though. All of the other main characters are especially forgettable, especially Halle Berry's character, who is supposedly the female lead. I think most of the audiences wanted the protagonist to end up with the second female lead, who is a tad more interesting. And I think the filmmakers realized this, too, because the hero only barely ends up with Berry at the end. The movie is also in need of laughs. I chuckled a bit, but that was all. The funniest moment is the robot who does the robot dance. As much as I can complain, though, I would still highly recommend (renting) it for the visuals alone.",2005
6,"I'm an animator and I can appreciate the work that went into this film. Its visually interesting, but at the same time cluttered. So from a technical stand point it had its pros. Overall the story was mildly interesting. It started out really slow and I wasn't sure whether I would be able to get through the whole movie. But it did pick up a little bit as the movie went on. Now for the major negative points. ",2005
8,"I enjoyed the movie a lot, especially the first half. May be I was attracted by all the machines moving around. There were very nicely designed contraptions. Also there were some very good jokes. The best ones from my point of view were, after they assemble the baby, the mother says: ""12 hours of labor"". Right after the dad says: ""He has got your mums eyes and my dads nose. I knew it was smart to save those parts"". The story was enjoyable but the end was a bit childish so to say. But the whole idea of a robot society that has human habits is brilliant. If you are looking for a movie that the whole family can enjoy, this movie is definitely for you.",2009
7,"For me, the thing that pretty much makes this CGI film is Robin Williams voicing a robot called Fender and Wonderbot. These two characters engaged me the whole way, as they are funny, (in the case of Fender), cute (in the case of Wonderbot) and interesting. The rest of the film is perfectly all right, in between brilliant and mediocre. The animation, for me, is probably the third best part of the film, especially the CGI backgrounds with the immense detail. Of course, I liked everything else about this film, apart from the fact that there was quite a deal of evil in this film and some parts of the film are a little bit cliché.",2008
8,"I went to see this with a friend at the cinema. I'd seen no trailers and wasn't really expecting anything special, but i came out of the cinema a couple of hours later, with a great big smile and my face and a fulfilled feeling inside. Robots is one of the most feel good films you can see! Every character had been thought about carefully, and each personality shines through throughout the film. The great choice of voice-overs really makes the film special. I was really impressed at how lifelike they made the range of characters look, while still keeping with the theme of the weird and wonderful robot world. We follow Rodney Copperbottom, the root whos grown up, dreaming of being an inventor. He comes from a less-fortunate family, but with the wonderful words of Bigweld (the greatest inventor in the world) - 'you cans shine no matter what you're made of' in his heart he fights for his dream, like all good robots should ;) The story keeps going at a good pace, i never felt it was rushed or dragging on. The music in the film, especially for the 'washing up' scene is used really well, and really makes you feel the emotions of the movie. I rented out this DVD as soon as it was available and soon after i brought it for myself. I've watching it with 4 generations of people now and everyones really enjoyed the film. Id recommend it to anyone who likes a feel good, fun, well created, emotional, funny, clever and heart warming film. So i guess thats all of you? Enjoy!",2006
8,"The novelty of animated films may have worn off since the revolutionary days of the Lion King, but I'd be lion if I said this wasn't one of the better ones to have come out of the animated scene in recent times. After learning the ropes with Ice Age, Wedge takes animation a step further - creating a movie with a real adults themes and motifs and yet still enough slapstick comedy to amuse younger generations.",2006
4,"""Robots"" is the latest computer animated feature film from the creators of Ice Age. Like many films of the same genre, ""Robots"" offers a new artistic style and a large cast of voice talents, all of which would make pretty entertaining guests on any episode of Saturday Night Live... However ""Robots"" is more of a sight to see than a movie-going experience to fully enjoy.",2005
10,"I was fascinated very much with the Robots movie. Despite that I hadn't seen an animated movie in quite some time, this movie took be back to the childhood days of passionate, diligent, and intriguing watching of a movie which was entertaining as well as inspiring. The theme of big business and personal aspirations of success and justice were there, but also were the characters which made the struggle and the journey fun just by the humor on such subjects as companionship, competition, social interface, and confidential rapport. The family support and friendship emphasis more than enhanced the theme to value the consumer and bring back honesty and integrity to the marketplace of products and salesmanship. However, also I enjoyed the fun-moments during all the diverse ways of achieving honor and respectful ways of doing things, which satirized humorously certain aspects of life we enjoy but are not sure how to fully partake in such as meetings, social functions, holidays, conquest, discussing issues, and consulting allies. So therefore, if politics, economics, corporate control, social networking, and entertainment among friends, family and colleagues seems complex and overwhelming, for a little bit of amusement and relief, watch the movie, because the issues will linger on, but you can get as much enjoyment in them as you wish by paying attention to the keen way these aspects of life are displayed.",2005
7,"OK so first thing's first, this movie is forgettable. The only time I remember this movie is when I run across it like I did here on IMDb.",2010
10,"This is a great movie for all ages! There are funny parts for parents and kids! One of the best animated comedies I have seen in a long time. This movie has a great inspirational plot and teaches you to never give up! ""Robots"" is full of vibrant colors and outstanding detail and will keep you entertained through the entire movie! ""Robots"" is a roller-coaster of fun; mostly a comedy but yet has a few serious parts but still a very easy movie to follow. If you are trying to find a movie for the family to watch and haven't seen Robots yet, this should definitely be the movie you watch! A family must see! Two thumbs up and an absolute 10 out of 10!",2010
7,"If you completely ignore anything and everything that has to do with the Amityville stories, then this is a pretty decent horror flick. Ryan Reynolds turns in a very effective performance, reminiscent of Jack Nicholson in ""The Shining."" By the end of the flick, i was scared of the dude. The rest of the cast was solid, as well. Lots of scares throughout the film, but a little too much of the ""MTV style"" editing, especially in the last fifteen minutes or so. But all in all, a decent effort, just like i said.",2005
8,"A remake of the film by the same name from 1979, which was based on Jay Anson's book about a supposedly ""true"" haunting, Amityville Horror begins in familiar territory by showing us Ronald DeFeo, Jr. (Brendan Donaldson) murdering his family. A year later, newlyweds George (Ryan Reynolds) and Kathy Lutz (Melissa George), with three kids from her previous marriage in tow, buy the vacant house at a steal, although they hesitate a bit once they learn why it's so cheap. Strange occurrences begin not long after they settle in. George becomes increasingly impatient and hostile, daughter Chelsea (Chloe Moretz) begins seeing the dead DeFeo girl, and so on. The film recounts their very brief but tumultuous stay at the home the Lutz's believed would be their dream home, but which turned into a nightmare.",2005
10,"My advice: Don't see the 1979 version first, don't think about it too hard, pretend it's not based on the ""true story"", and just enjoy this great horror film. It may not be a timeless classic, but its fun. The thing I liked best about this one is that everything makes sense. There's no cliffhangers or overly complicated mystery that never gets explained. It's just 89 minutes of very frightening ghosts popping up and some surprisingly appropriate acting. In fact, I would say this movie has one of the most petrifying ghost scenes ever.(The boy in the bathroom!)The costumes/makeup were really good too. Also, I loved Ryan Reynolds in a scary movie. I thought his quirky style was a perfect complement to the cast. He makes a smooth transition from Van Wilder to Blade 3 to Amityville because he seems to just be himself.",2005
5,"In terms of cinematic legacy, the original ""The Amityville Horror"" managed to foreshadow both ""The Shining"" and ""Poltergeist"" while swiping a few nods from ""The Exorcist."" But time has not been kind to the hit 1979 horror film, once considered spooky but now considered at best a camp classic.",2005
9,"When it comes to making a film in Hollywood these days it would appear that they are running out of original material. Any film that is over 10 years old has the chance of being remade but the real question is which will be better. This is a film that breaks the normal mold of being awful compared to its predecessor. I actually really enjoyed this remake and found myself more scared in this one than the original. Was this film Better? No. But it holds its own on its own merits. Having read the book, this one is a little more true to the story and for that I applaud the film makers. The film was very good and I rate it in my Horror Hall of Fame.",2005
1,"After seeing this movie I had to admit it was the absolute worst movie I have ever seen (Battlefield Earth included). When this train wreck of a movie was finished I had to wonder...did the script writer and/or director even read the book or see the original movie???? Refresh my memory..at what point in the book does George Lutz become an axe wielding psychopath??? Where does it mention some ignorant Indian killing preacher that lived in the house and had a torture chamber in the basement? When in the hell did they get this stuff. I seriously think dimension films owes me a refund for the time spent at this movie. I went to their website, but there is no way to contact them, no surprise there. If they keep putting out garbage like this I wouldn't want anyone being able to contact me either. I really don't remember any part in the book or original movie where Mrs. Lutz turns into some Bruce Willis one-liner spouting action hero. ""No one dies today!"" before wacking George with a shotgun or whatever the hell she picked up. If I were the Lutz's I would be ticked to be portrayed in this way. After making this movie, poor Ryan Reynolds actually has to keep Blade Trinity and Van Wilder on his resume as his best work to-date. Sorry Ryan, hope things get better for you. Please avoid this movie if you can, and if you did already see it, let me know if you know how to get a hold of the studio so I can demand a refund.",2005
8,"Okay, let me start out by saying that I only started watching scary movies with ""Signs."" I loved it, and it really scared me. Since I saw it, I've been watching lots of horror movies, and so far, haven't found one that scared me as badly as ""Signs."" I saw the movies that people said were the scariest ever, like The Excorsist, Saw, and Scream, but I really found none of them scary. Finally, I see Amittyville Horror, and let me say: I loved it. It came near scaring me as much as signs! There weren't many kills, which I hated about typical slasher, and generally, it was the mood and atmosphere that scared. I will admit, though, I never saw the original, but really, I loved this movie. I would highly recommend it to anyone that likes horror movies!",2006
8,"Forget, for a moment, that you ever saw the original. Forget the 'based on true events' tag-line - inevitably there to sell extra tickets. After all, a horror film based on true events is Hotel Rwanda, far scarier than this - though for different reasons.",2005
1,"*There MAY be spoilers, although you will probably thank me for the one's I point out*",2005
1,"This is easily the worst remake I've ever seen, apart from The Haunting. The original belonged to the 70's school of effective, atmospheric horror films, and although a bit silly, works. This failed on every level from the terrible pacing, confusing narrative and comical 'scarey bits'....It was unoriginal and obvious in the way a Muppet movie would be and played on every horror cliché in the worst possible way. The characters were fillers.....Completely unbelievable and served only to drag the story screaming to it's conclusion...In the horror genre reality is not a requirement....Feasibilty is !...You only need to suggest it might be possible and your audience will go with you...The film assumes it's audience has never seen any film, horror or otherwise....It took up 90 minutes I my life...I want them back !",2005
8,"I was fortunate enough to see a sneak of the new ""Amityville"" earlier this evening. Not bad. Not bad at all. Ryan Reynolds was actually surprisingly good in the film. Yes, Van Wilder acted. The scares were just that, scares. I've seen more than my share of horror films and I always pinpoint the moment the cat jumps out. Not this time. No cat. That's all I'm gonna say. Enthralled as I was by the first hour or so (and I'm talking a five star movie at this point) the last half hour left me flat. But, I digress. I did think that first hour was amazing. Faster paced than original and it went for the more visceral scares which do work most of the time. I give this flick a 7 out of 10. I have voted it an 8 out of 10 simply because it was rated R. Kudos to the filmmakers for not appealing only to the in school crowd. We're adults, we can take it. Thank you guys for letting US make that decision.",2005
8,"I really loved this remake, it had all the elements of the original but contained equally creepy scenes. The pig eyes from the first flick would have been a nice touch. As far as acting, I think they did terrific. The fact that Ryan Reynolds was in it was enough for me. The man has amazing comedic timing even for a horror flick. I never would have thought the two guys and a girl star would be where he is now. Melissa George, has proved herself to be naturally talented, and matured from the alias bad-guy image. The storyline was well written along with dead on consistency, and beautiful cinematography. A break from the routine of LA and NY.",2005
7,"This movie was one of the scariest movies I have seen in a long time. I think it is definitely better than the original. I have never jumped so much in a movie before. There is a lot more information in this movie than there was in the original. Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George did a great job, especially Ryan, I have never seen anyone who can look so mean. If anyone remembers Jodie from the first movie, she was a pig, she isn't a pig in this one, she is just a little girl, but a creepy little girl. I will definitely buy this movie when it comes out on DVD, I liked it that much. If you are looking for a good scary movie, I would recommend this movie. This movie does not have a lot of gore, and does not go to over the top with things that could never happen, it is done just right.",2005
7,"This might be the scariest film I have ever seen. It had everything Horror, suspense, drama, hot women e.g.the babysitter, gore, everything you want in a horror movie you get here. Don't believe the reviews. Not only is it the scariest it might be one of the best acted horror films. Especially funny man Ryan Renyolds who gives the best nice guy turned phsyco since Nicholson. From the very first frame to the very last you will be terrified. I could keep going but I wont because you should be in the car going and seeing this horror masterpiece. That surpasses the original in so many ways I've lost count. So I will leave you with this tonight when you go to bed take a couple sleeping pills because if I was you I wouldn't want to wake up at 3:15. Well I G2G Later people",2005
1,All i can Say is why bother! The film is so far from the truth the only Factual part of the film is the first 5 minutes.,2005
3,"In all honesty, I think this film was rather confused. When it first started I felt like we were sitting through some sort of satire of the original...Ryan Reynolds is too much of a comedian so I had a hard time believing a lot of his ""serious"" delivery of lines. Then in the middle I thought I was watching a really bad Britney Spears music video (A 16 yr old scantily clad babysitter asking a 12 yr old if he's ever french kissed??), and finally towards the end I thought it was another remake of 13 Ghosts. Yes...if you liked the original then it is safe to say you will hate this film like me. Don't bother going to the theater to see it, or even waste the $4.00 rental fee to rent it. Wait till it airs on TBS about 3 yrs from now at 8 o'clock at night...trust me...you will appreciate the warning. 3.5/10",2005
8,"I went into the theatre with mixed expectations... Thinking of Ryan Reynolds in a serious character position (Blade: Trinity doesn't count here) sounded dangerous, but interesting, and I wasn't disappointed. He plays George Lutz, an easy-going guy with a great lifestyle. Recently married, he lives with his new wife Kathy (Mellisa George) who most Aussies will recognise from the long-running series 'Home and Away.' Reynolds doesn't let us down in one of his best performances, considering before this his history contained comedy all around. The movie starts off in good fashion also. Instead of a long, boring start sequence, the action kicks off around 10 minutes in, and i'm sure a lot of people will appreciate this.",2005

8,"I gave this such a high rating because it really surpassed my expectations. Since we had free passes, I went in with the mindset of ""I'm getting in for free. It must be terrible."" Honestly, this is one of the scariest movies I've seen. Granted the musical crescendos were overused, the red balloon thing was kind of silly, the use of a small child as a scare tactic is overdone, and the CG flies were badly done. But what movie doesn't have a bit of cheese sprinkled on top? Ryan Reynolds also has surpassed my expectations (in more ways than one.) He's quite excellent. ;-) One thing that makes me EXTREMELY happy is that the movie doesn't have the obligatory shot of a woman's bare chest. (You do, however see a short sex scene with nothing more than a bare back.) Being a girl, I really don't want to see that. It's totally stupid and unnecessary anyway. No boobies=A+ ... I'm not any sort of movie buff, but I know that this film scared the bejeezus out of me and the people I went with. I thought it was great. You don't have to trust my opinion. It's all relative anyway.",2005
10,"I just got back from the Red carpet premiere on Thursday (I'm that dedicated to travel all the way to California), let's just say that even the stars of the movie were screaming, it was THAT scary. Let me start by saying this is better than the original in every single possible way. Reynolds pulls off a serious role well, and is not overacted a la James Brolin. The kids are great, the girl who befriends Jodie DeFeo (The only downside to the film is that they changed Allison's name to this to fit Jodie, in my opinion it would've worked better if she just made up a name for her old name). It also serves as more of a complete film. It goes more on the John Ketchum aspect of the story. There is no ""red room"" thank god.",2005

7,"I do not think that this movie deserves the low rating that most will give it. It's one of the best ""teenager"" horror films I've ever seen; and that's saying a lot. Nothing is left without an explanation to back it up, the characters and plot break countless horror movie stereotypes, and it has got nothing to do with some other horrible pieces we've been submitted to lately. (A clear example is the mindless ""Saint Ange"".) The first 30-40 minutes might be downright boring with the exception of the beginning, although some minor light mistakes can be easily spotted. After the arrival to the village, though, the horror -a different, twisted kind of horror- begins.",2005
8,"I wanted to avoid this when it released in theatre because of being a fan of Vincent Prices original House of wax. But when i saw this in theatre i was surprised that it wasn't the remake of the original. In fact it has shades of Tourist trap. Nevertheles this film is very entertaining n has some very good cool death scenes. The deaths r gruesome. It is effectively paced with some lovely cinematography, good character development, good background story of the creepy villain. Hilton's death scene was the best one. Yeehaw!",2017
7,"I wasn't expecting to much of this movie when I went into the theater but I had been waiting for it for many years. To sum it up, it was pretty damn good! Chad Michael Murray was pretty good, I thought he was going to be another Chris Flynn from Wrong Turn but I was wrong. Elisha Cuthbert was also good but the best performance has to go to Brian Van Holt. He played the bad guy too well, I mean he was sick, sadistic, and very cruel. The back story between the brothers was good, plus I liked how no killings took place until about 40 minutes into the film. It gave you time to pick the character you wanted to see live and the one you wanted to see die. Jon Abrahams was pretty good as the goofy best bud of CMM. I liked how Chad kind of cried when he found him dead, it was better then just him being like, ""Whatever, my buddy is dead, who cares"". It showed how he really cared. So overall, this was a darn god slasher with some great effects. Bravo!",2005
7,"A lot of people are flaming this film for the presence of Paris Hilton, but this is not a fair reason to object to the movie. The reality is that Paris has a fairly minimal part, she spends the vast majority of the movie off screen. The film also makes fun of her on several occasions, usually involving a camera and at least once in night vision. For those who enjoy Paris Hiltons stage presence, this may be a movie to see at home when its released on video, because at the screening I was at, we all laughed at her misfortunes through the movie and she is portrayed as a ""woman of questionable values"".",2005
8,"While HOUSE OF WAX will never be mistaken for Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE or HALLOWEEN, it does try and ultimately succeed in being a worthy addition to quality horror film making. There is enough tension and enough implied gore in here to please the young audience of today and there is also enough explicit gore to please some of the purists of yesterday. Overall, it is quite a well done film that should do okay on DVD.",2005

Upon waking the next morning they make a gruesome discovery and decide to go into town for a broken car part. The town is creepy and I'm just gonna stop there. Because thats when the truly gruesome mayhem begins. trust me when I say if your looking for a horror film go see this you will love it. It's wonderfully diabolical and inventive with it's killing scenes, the story is interesting and the characters are decently drawn with the actors giving them gobs of personality. Paris Hilton included whom does quite well with her part. the film lies a little on the shallow side but it's so much fun and who cares. This movie should eat up the box office and all horror fans should have part in it. Go see House of Wax the film that features skin being peeled, super glued lips, dead animal carcasses, hot wax sprayed on a still living person, a finger being cut off, a decapitation, a pole through the head and much more. I was lucky enough to witness this film at the Tribeca premiere and all the actors were on hand to promote the film.

It is not to dirty for kids, and it is not to boring and fake for adults. House of Wax really explains what the movie is about. A group of kids going to a football game take a shortcut and wind up where no one goes except Bo and Vincent! The house of Wax was very realistic. None of it would be hard to believe if it were to happen in real life. Chad Michael Murray did the best acting in the movie. His attitude really changed at the end. Carly (his twin sister in the movie) was yet another good actress in the movie not screaming and complaining to much like in other movies I have seen lately.",2006
9,"I'll admit I rented House of Wax mainly to have a good look at Paris Hilton because I figured I was in for just another clichéd horror film. I was wrong. It starts of sort of making to guess who the bad guys are, who the good guys are, what the bad guys are up to, how the good guys are going to start being killed etc. This is good as keeps you interested and concentrating on the movie (you'd be surprised how many horror films leave out this element). Then you get in the more classic horror scenarios, first person dies without the others knowing so they have to stay because they can't leave their friend. This part of the movie is done well because originality is used in very unique ways as you'll find out towards the end.",2005

It had me on the edge of my seat the the entire movie. It had jumpy scenes, LOADS of suspense, and plenty of gore. Elisha is excellent in it and she is SO rough in the end. Paris was alright and her chase scene was decent. It wasn't close to as good as Sarah Michelle Gellars in IKWYDLS, but it was pretty good. The special effects were awesome, especially at the end! The characters were cool, except all the characters fall for the classic blunders, like walking into a deserted house, etc etc. BUT the characters also had a lot of realistic reactions.

1,"A horrible, horrible, horrible film. I saw the original when I was a kid and it gave me nightmares into my teens. When I found out a remake was on the way, I groaned. WHY OH WHY remake a good film? Well, we can thank Dark Castle for buggering yet another classic horror film. This time they've replaced a somewhat interesting story with gore, slower than slow pacing, and yawn-inspired characters. Someone previously said that s/he was surprised that Paris Hilton can act. Uh, were you watching the film? She plays a prissy little tramp. Sounds like typecasting to me. Half of the people in the audience actually CHEERED when she died! That tells you why people are seeing this film. If that's your only reason, then find a better one, because like a black hole this thing will suck out more of your life than you'll want. Had I been alone, I would have left 10 minutes into the boring exposition. This thing is like a moron's guide to crap film-making: In bred Southern git, stupid but attractive leads, knives a plenty, gore a plenty, stock menacing truck, I could go on. After watching this film, I began to really appreciate Jeepers Creepers, and I thought that film sucked. Save yourself and avoid this crapfest at every cost.",2005
8,"My college theater just had a special screening last night of this film. I have got to say that I think everyone was impressed with how good this movie was. Though, my roommate didn't care for it but he's not into horror movies anyway and just went to see if Paris Hilton can act. By the way, if you're worried about that, don't be. I'm not exactly one of her fans, but I must be honest and say she was pretty good and she has the best death scene. Overall, all the actor's were very good. I'm not gonna go into detail for the plot since I'm sure you know about it. Surpirsisngly, the characters are pretty engaging and you actually care for them, especially Elisha Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray's characters. We meet them as rival siblings and end with them having to work together. Another plus is that it does not have the sleek look of Amityville Horror or Texas Chainsaw Massacre and feels almost documentary-like rather than a music video (Don't get me wrong, I loved Texas Chainsaw and enjoyed Amityville).",2005
7,"This movie turned out to be much better than it should have been. I found the opening few minutes involving the two villains when they were young, quite distressing to watch, which did surprise me.",2009
10,"yes.. i simply loved it, it was pure horror, with a lot of suspense in between, and a lot of powerful scenes, this movie goes all the way to my top 10, in some scenes was breathtaking, and a little choking like when jared's character (wade) was sitting there, all covered in wax, and Dalton starts to peel it off to.. well.. free him.. and we see the flesh under all that wax, and his tears running over it.. and Dalton's saying ""sorry, dude.."" i thought that was a remarkable scene... well, all this to say that this movie is amazing, and whoever like horror movies but with substance, with an amazing story as a background, shouldn't miss it.. it definitely worth it!",2005

8,"I, unlike other people, did not find this movie to be a disappointment. I didn't go into this movie with high expectations. A movie based on a video game will never have an amazing story, or exceptionally good acting worth an academy award. A movie like this will have good action, reasonable suspense, and be the type of movie you can watch again and enjoy it just as much as the first time. For the most part, this movie lives up to those expectations. It has good action sequences, it is a re-watchable movie, and the storyline isn't quite as bad as I thought it would be. Sure, they changed stuff from the video game during the transition, but it still worked, and you cant expect everything in the video game to work as a movie, they had to change some things to help the cinematic view of it. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch a movie with solid action sequences and anyone who is looking for some fun with their friends.",2006
7,"Doom is not a masterpiece. However for what it is, a video game to movie franchise, it does a decent job. I was watching this film when suddenly my parents came in. They immediately sat down and watched the last 50 minutes with me. Surely that's an indication that the film itself wasn't too bad. My favourite part of the movie was the FPS scene. It showed a level of originality which has been absent in other Video game movies, such as the Resident Evil franchise. Another Pro was the casting of the Rock as Sarge and Karl Urban as Reaper. Both made decent performances in the movie.",2007

The atmosphere should have built to an unbearable, silent tension. Then, and only then, the hideous creatures from hell should have started climbing out of walls and from under floors, and devouring the marines.",2005
10,When getting ready to see this movie at the cinema I was expecting nothing more than a complete no brainer action movie passing itself of as horror (i.e Alone In The Dark) but what I got was much scarier and exciting than anything I could have expected.,2005
6,"OK, we are all hearing how Doom the movie is a complete sellout etc, but still this is an enjoyable movie. The Rock as Sarge is absolutely perfect! i just couldn't imagine Karl Urban doing a better job then The Rock when it comes to Sarge. Although many have branded this film ""Resident Evil in Space"" and yeah it is but that doesn't subtract from the film at all. The 1st person scene was especially pulled off well and will give you some giggles (c'mon who didn't laugh?).The Score is absolutely awesome and sets the atmosphere perfectly! too me this film had an old school 80's horror feel to it which i felt made it that more enjoyable (we got lots of uncensored over the top gore which now we don't get enough of). Overall don't judge this movie till you see it because it is a lot better then people rate it unless your looking to find something thats a 100% identical too its source material (Doom 3) then i'd advise you to not watch this film because some of it has been completely rewritten from its original context hence no hell. Overall a lot better then what i was expecting too see",2005

7,"I never got to see this movie in the theater and recently got a chance to see the uncut edition. Honestly my very first impression of the movie was ""this is cool"". Then my fanboyism got a hold of me and realized it was not doom. Honestly if this movie would have been called ""UAC Marines"", ""Viral Apocalypse"" or something else random, this movie would have done A LOT better. It was actually really good for a sci-fi movie. Much in the vein of Resident Evil meets Mission To Mars. The thing that really made this movie not a movie about DOOM however was the lack of cohesive elements to the game story. In the game it's all about hell and demons and weird psycho doctors wanting to be more psycho. The movie focuses on an ancient race designing a machine called the ARC, this machine makes direct transport to mars possible. There seems to be a problem on mars and the UAC Marines are sent in to investigate. The next about an hour and forty five minutes is all about trying to figure out what happened and destroy the threat if any. It's your very standard sci-fi story but it achieves what it's meant to do. Entertain you for a moment. The movies main downfall is it is only LOOSELY based around the game that everyone wanted to see on film. However to appease the fanboys(girls?) out there DOOM does have a very unique experience visually in the form of a (about 5-10 minute) segment where the camera is completely shot in first person perspective. Which having never seen this EVER done in a film was really neat. A bit out of place where they chose to do it in my opinion but cool nonetheless. Overall if you want to see a really interesting take on a sci-fi movie checkout DOOM, if you are wanting a direct translation of the video game, I suggest you just keep playing the video game.",2006
10,"Good grief. Does what it says on the tin. A no-nonsense, straightforward blood and gore fest with some nice scares and good pacing. Acting & script a bit on the cheesy side - which actually fits nicely with the overall premise of the flick, y'know: adapted from a video game, Mars, marines, unfeasibly extreme weaponry, motherf*****g monsters etc. The first-person stuff is a complete blast and a great homage to the source material - I tittered my way through the entire sequence, much to the annoyance of an OAP sat next to me.",2005

9,"I went to see this movie to pass the time, but it is now probably one of the most entertaining comedies i have seen in a long long time. The Cast is rich and the slapstick comedy is hilarious! ",2006
9,"My fiancé and I went and saw this movie the other day and thought it was great! The humor was well-placed and it was great to see Ryan Reynolds in a movie where he wasn't surrounded by tasteless humor every 5 minutes. Me and my fiancé both agreed that the funniest bit throughout the whole movie was the relationship between Reynolds character and his brother. The slap-fights were great and the one moment of brotherly love was simply hilarious. If you're tired of the raunchy humor of the likes of 40-Year Old Virgin and want a good movie for a date or just as a stand alone movie, this one is great. It's got so many things in it that make it wonderful: Tasteful witty humor, good plot, puts you in the Christmas spirit (but also works as a non-seasonal movie), and gives props to any guy who's been put in the ""Friend-zone"". My fiancé came out of the movie and said ""That makes me feel bad about all the guys I've told them I 'just want to be friends'"". So there you go guys--if you got a girl you're crushing on and you think you might be in the ""Friend-zone"" with her, take her to this movie (even if it's just a ""friendly date""). It may break the ice and she could see what kind of girl she's being. I found my 'one and only', but I've been in the friend-zone several times, so I was able to relate to this movie in many ways.",2005
8,"I don't understand some of the brutal reviews that this movie has been getting. Ebert gave it a 'D'. He wanted to focus on Reynold's character losing the weight. Seeing as Roger's always been a chubby guy, that's important to him, but it would have made for more of a more expected plot line. My opinion is closer to Entertainment Weekly's 'B+'. Sure, it's a light romantic comedy, but the performances of Anna Faris and Ryan Reynolds alone are worth the price of admission. I thought the characters were all well-played and the dialog moved the movie along faster than its 96 minutes running time. An excellent date movie. Also, a good movie to see with that person that you're trying to get out of the ""friend's zone"" because you'll end up talking about the movie afterwords.",2005

8,"""Just Friends"" is one of the best romantic comedies I have seen in a long time, but my only problem was on how it ended because it seemed like it just wanted to get it done and over with. But I could relate to Amy Smart's character in some ways, so being able to be in touch with the film I think helped a great deal. Also, I loved the jokes! Anna Farris is one of my favorite comedic actresses, she knows how to carry a joke and make her character so funny! She's just a hoot in this film! Amy and Ryan looked so cute together in this film and the jokes are non stop. The love story is also very touching and I think a ton of people could relate to it. So, I would highly recommend this film for a good laugh and a touching one at that. So, sit back and enjoy! ",2006
7,"""Just Friends"" is about a guy named Chris (Ryan Reynolds) who in high school was an overweight but caring, sweet, and likable guy. Chris wanted to date his best friend Jamie (Amy Smart) but they never did because she wanted to just be friends and date the cool guys. Ten years later, Chris sheds all his weight and is now a big time record producer touring with the hottest pop star Samantha James (Anna Faris). While on their plane to Paris, Chris and Samantha's plane has to make an emergency landing and the plane lands near Chris's old home town. To make matters worst, Chris winds up going into the bar where he runs into his old crush Jamie. So does Chris have what it takes for Jamie and him to be more than just friends? ",2005
10,"I found this film to have great chemistry. They had Ryan Reynold, playing a former obese guy which i found particularly pecant, and Anna Ferris as a creepy, ""Paris Hilton"" stalker, which was great because she added a lot of comedy to the film. Also the gags were classic, and reminded me of National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, which is one of my favorites, not to mention being somewhat similar to Van Wilder, in its attempt to Woo a woman while having a ""nemesis"" in the way of his goal along with Ryan's own personal problems with his past, and dealing with his brother, his ""former"" crazed girlfriend, and his out of touch mom (just kind of naive to things going on). All in all, i found this movie to be a great comedy that i would like to see again at the theaters. Its a classic holiday flick in my opinion.",2005
10,"This is funny film that you can see with anyone. The humor is universal and hits home with anyone who's ever had any sort of dating relationship. The best thing is that the laughs come from hilarious situations that you could explain to your parents without feeling uncomfortable. This is one of the few funny movies I've seen recently that avoids any crude toilet or sexual humor, and gets it's laughs from simple social situations. I loved American Pie, but would feel weird discussing the funny parts with anyone I didn't know very well. This movie deserves more credit for humor derived strictly from believable social situations.",2005
3,"I rarely give bad reviews, and I'm a real expert in romantic comedies, I've seen a great deal of the good and the bad ones, and this one is definitely among the latter. It's lacking everything, except potential and some potentially edible actors. ",2012
3,"Amy Smart plays an innocent bitch, Ryan Reynolds and obsessive lovable jackass and Anna Faris plays CRAZY. This could have been a decent story but there's no love but obsession and insecurities. It wasn't painful but it certainly wasn't pleasant.",2011
10,"I just saw this movie, and it is hands down funny. The humor outweighed some of the plot flaws that the critics so eloquently exploited, but IT YOU WANT TO LAUGH, GO SEE THIS MOVIE. All of the actors are excellent, the story isn't one you have to think about, and best of all its about love and revenge, who can't relate to that? Not only will this movie keep you laughing, it will catch you off guard with some of the more serious moments that fuels the comedy. I would have to say that this film definitely comes close to Wedding Crashers and the 40-Year Old Virgin. New Line definitely has released a little gem with this one, finally a reason to return to the movie theaters.",2005
6,BEWARE OF FALSE REVIEWS & REVIEWERS. SOME REVIEWERS HAVE ONLY ONE REVIEW TO THEIR NAME. NOW WHEN ITS A POSITIVE REVIEW THAT TELLS ME THEY WERE INVOLVED WITH THE MOVIE.

2,"I was flipping through some movie channels late one night, just looking for a decent movie to watch before I fell asleep. Well, I stumbled across this one, and before I even knew it, I had been watching for 45 minutes. The reason I started watching it was because I, too, had gone through a similar situation, where I was crazy about a girl in school, was considered a ""friend"", etc etc etc. I kind of ""felt"" for the character, Chris, during the first part of the movie. Well, I am still wondering why I let myself watch this whole movie. It was extremely predictable, it was poorly written, very unrealistic, and just plain bad. Without ruining the scenes, or giving away too much, you'll just have to take my word for it. After an hour of watching, I wanted to go to bed, but was actually laughing at how *rediculous* it was. The scenes which involved Chris going to see Jamie were just pathetic. The way people acted in certain scenes is *not* how people act in real life. Too many times I found myself scoffing, saying, ""what the heck! People do *not* do that"". ""Accidents"" that happened in the movie were blown way out of proportion, and ""dumb"" characters were really overused. It's just a big waste. I am actually mad at myself for losing two hours of my life, and two hours of sleep, on this piece of trash. This movie is not for intelligent people. It is for dumb teenagers with nothing else to do. I now feel ashamed to admit that I was one of the idiots that watched it.",2006
10,"Just Friends is a very good comedy to go see during the holidays. It takes off with a hilarious start but gets a little weak during the last 10 minutes, however the rest is hilarious! Anna Farris is the funniest crazy girl since Isla Fisher (the red head who played Gloria Cleary in Wedding Crashers) She does a very good job of coming off as a Paris Hilton mixed with Ashlee Simpson! Too funny! If you like romantic comedies (no this is not a chick flick) then this will be perfect for you! Chris's younger brother also does a nice performance of making sure his older brother Chris is well informed that he is a loser that can't ""boink"" the girl of his dreams while trying to get-it-on with Sam (the crazy girl played by Anna Farris) Either way, this movie appeals to all in need of a good laugh this holiday season.

Scores of high-pitched screams puncture the soundtrack while low frequency sound effects accompany every groin shot and pratfall, of which there are plenty.",2005
1,"I usually quite like romantic comedies, as they are a nice light entertainment after a stressful workday. This movie, however, was not enjoyable at all. The jokes were so predictable, and what is worse, several times during this movie I caught myself thinking ""This cannot possibly get any more stupid"" but I was proved wrong every single time. May be it would be a nice entertainment after a few drinks but in any other situation I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Unless you really feel the urge to throw away two hours of your life. The only positive aspect about this movie was the good-looking female main character :)",2014
1,"It's pretty self-explanatory what I believe about this movie. The movie is predictable and one of the most cliché movies I have ever seen. My roommate and I see a lot of movies, at least 4 new one's a week. He received this particular one only because all of our roommates in the house had seen the rest of Ryan Reynold's terrible film legacy and thought what the hell. What's one more, right? By far the worst work he had ever done (and that's saying something for Ryan Reynolds). Anyhow, I would caution anyone with real taste for movies because this had no substance or, for that matter, any legitimate laugh. Furthermore, the fat costume was awful and looked ridiculous, the plot development (heck what plot?) was done very poorly, and the music (though a very minor part of the ridiculousness of the movie) sounded like it was building up a romance movie and didn't work at all. Missed it's point entirely. So in closing, I personally disliked this movie and put it up there on my top five worst movies ever because it was misery watching it. It's only my opinion though.",2006
1,"Watched about an hour of this trash before I turned it off, absolute trash. Go outside and enjoy your life you will have way more fun than watching this movie.

3,"This movie lasts just 90 minutes and it's really boring and disconnected from reality. Who needs a romantic comedy that doesn't make you laugh and that it's not romantic at all? The whole plot is trivial and expect. I thought it to be special, but I was wrong. I rated it 3, just because the last 5 minutes are sufficient, but the rest would deserve 1 (awful). Life is not like that. I'm tired of people who produce movies just for money, writing down a plot that could seem beautiful, but it's not. The result is that the watcher feels offended. My final suggestion to you is to not waste your time watching this movie, just watch anything else, the world is full of wonderful movies!",2014
6,"This movie is about a woman who plays hard to get and about a man who is stupid enough to be let himself be jerked around. If a woman likes you she will let him know it, in no uncertain terms. Unfortunately, if a woman does not like a man, the signs of that may not be so obvious as the woman plays the man for whatever selfish reasons may motivate her. If the man is deluded or muddled enough, he may not pick up on the signals and will be taken for a ride, an EXPENSIVE ride. This is what this movie is about: a man who lets himself be taken for a ride. Is this movie funny. NO! Rather, it is tragic because it is a commentary on how men and women use sex to manipulate each other. She is pushing the guy's buttons and the guy is letting his buttons be pushed. Really sick. Indeed, this movie shows how messed up men and women can become, especially when their sexual hormones are flowing. The movie itself is not bad; it's the theme of the story that is so negative yet so true. When a man lets a woman know that he likes her, REALLY likes her, he is setting himself up to be zonked because women tend to harbor disdain for men who actually like them and WILL play hard to get. And why not? If the guy is willing to take the woman to dinner, at expensive restaurants no less, take her on trips, buy her presents, and lavish other gifts on her, what woman would say no? What woman in our materialistic world would say no? And in return, what does the guy get? Maybe a kiss on the cheek. The Beatles wrote a song, Can't Buy Me Love. Well, they were right. A man can't buy love, but he can buy disappointment and aggravation, especially if he is too dense to realize where the woman is coming from. But if a woman is smitten with a man, then the woman will do anything to please him; the sky's the limit. Of course, that can change at anytime, without warning. So guys, if the woman is hot for you, enjoy it while it lasts and remember, she will expect something in return.",2010
1,"This is a film that doesn't even try to be what it's supposed to be: a romantic comedy that gently pulls at the heartstrings. From a stock premise that could have been used for a politically correct life lesson (American teenage male overeater eventually slims down and wins the heart of his high school sweetheart), this film develops into a toxic catalogue of everything wrong with America. ",2010
4,"JUST FRIENDS was a hugely disappointing comedy that had the potential to be something really special but lost its way somehow. The film stars Ryan Reynolds as a former fatty who returns to his small hometown in New Jersey ten years after graduating from high school...rich, successful, and most importantly, thin and attempts to rekindle a romance with a girl (Amy Smart)who kept him in ""The Friends Zone"" in high school. The expected story path where the newly skinny person returns home to show off the new and improved version of himself goes terribly awry here because our hero is just not very likable and it's not the way he's written or the way Reynolds portrays him...it's a perfect melding of both. This character does some really unpleasant things and treats everyone in his path in a very shabby manner and Reynolds'performance is so over-the-top that it grates on the nerves. There are two memorable supporting turns by Anna Faris as a wigged-out client of Reynolds and Christopher Marquette as his little brother, but otherwise I'd take a pass on this unpleasant and unfunny film experience that works extremely hard for laughs but generates precious few.",2007

Due to a storm, he is forced to return to his old town with his girlfriend Samantha (a stupid empty-head blonde), there, he will meet Jaimie, and love will return, but now he is filled with arrogance and proud, so things will not be easy. Well it is the typical stupid Christmas movie, an absurd plot, none character is has the slightest coherence, not good jokes and as it happens in Christmas, everything has to end happily. Please, there's better ways to spend your time. It has not a 1 due to the fact that it contains one good joke, while they are all speaking in telephone at the same time and conversations start to mix. It is the only ""interesting"" moment.",2007

I couldn't have been more wrong! ",2005
10,"This is a film about a girl of 14 years old and a 32 years old guy. It is a movie about Hayley (more than excellent Ellen Page) and Jeff, about pedophilia and about how a pedophile must feel. Or maybe it is only a history of vengeance. You won't know until the end of the film. It sure is a difficult subject for a movie, but the script is excellently profiled in the psychological horror and does not turn to be obscene or anything than can visually or verbally hurt the sensibility of anyone. It is more like disturbing to hear a teenage girl speak how she does, and it is fascinating how your feelings will go from one character to the other during the movie until you realize that no matter what the end is, everyone is guilty of something and it is not to us, humans, to decide what bad actions can be justified by other bad actions.",2005
1,"Pardon me if that sounded emo, but this movie killed me a little bit on the inside. I ached every time I thought about it over the next couple of weeks. I was really excited to see Hard Candy at first. I thought it looked neat. I liked the cover, and the synopsis on the back intrigued me. So, like a fool, I rented it.",2007
1,"This tasteless and smug ""psychological thriller"" has been the subject of many rave reviews by critics who have little knowledge of what film actually is. Hard Candy thinks its daring and contemporary with its slick MTV visuals, but it resembles an advert more than a film in its self-conscious stylised mis en scene. But Hard Candy doesn't want to be shallow. It wants to be intellectual. And what do you get? A ""heroine"" who is as morally reprehensible as her victim. A heroine who spouts references and smart talk beyond her years. This just doesn't wash. Hayley, if we can call her that, is not really a character; she is a just a mouthpiece for Brian Nelson's pretentious dialogue. Her self-satisfied talk is annoying and unconvincing and is part of the reason why Hard Candy is such an astonishing failure of a film  a fact supported by its dismal Box Office performance. Hayley is simply not a sympathetic character and neither is Jeff, and the film's penchant for ambiguity further clouds any sense of background and motive that might justify what is happening in this trashy, faux art-house film. The film also has no sense of irony and subtlety: Nelson could have made points about the hypocrisy of Hayley and the role-reversals she undertakes but that would have disrupted the smug dialogue.",2006

8,I saw this at a late night screening at the Palm Springs International Film Festival and of the 35 films I saw there I would rank this #4. for about the first 10 minutes I didn't know if I was going to like it or where it was going to go but man once this roller-coaster starts moving it's a psychological thriller. Great stylized look to this film too. The acting and story is intense and you can't avert your eyes from the screen even though there are times where you think you might have to. I like movies that have the feel of a stage play and the emotional volleyball between the two principal actors is amazing. A little far-fetched but so what. This is a good movie. I give it a 8.5 out of a possible 10 and would recommend this film.,2006
1,"Hard Candy is a film about whether you can torture someone into admitting crimes they didn't commit. Unfortunately, in this film, the torturer turns out to be the hero... A hero I was never behind for a minute. Over the top acting on a predictable script, so many impossibilities and plot holes that it is hard to suspend disbelief for very long, and a leading lady that looks like a boy all add up to a miss. The only surprise in the film for me was that she didn't reveal herself to be a boy after all this. ",2006
1,"if you are in the mood for some serious sadomasochism, and please take note of the word 'serious', this might be a movie for you. otherwise, i would advise to save the 2 hours of your life. trust me, even watching commercials of soap is more useful/interesting/exciting. somehow, the creators of this wonderful piece forgot to mention the word 'pedophelia' in its description. I am not sure how this is possible given that this is the point of the movie - well, it does not really have a point, but this is what this 'film' allegedly tries to explore (without, I might add coming to any conclusion or a hint of thereof). when you watch the preview for this chef d'oeuvre, it sets up an intrigue of older man meeting a younger girl of in the net. interesting. here is a preview of this the trailer omits: a crazed teenager trying to cut the testicles of an alleged offender for about half an hour. A Saturday night killer (and by that I mean your Saturday night). Actually, this movie can kill the mood of any evening. so just to sum up, if you are in the mood for some sadomasochism, you have found what you are looking for. otherwise, as I said, even soap commercials are better. at least they don't leave you nauseous.",2006
1,"This was about the most uncomfortable, disturbing film I have seen in a long time. It has just been released in France (September, 2006). The acting was is places very good, even excellent, but making a 14-year-old into a brilliant revenge killer for a pedophile does not send an acceptable message. In fact, any male who sits through the castration scene could not possibly emerge with any empathy whatsoever for the girl! There is extreme moral confusion here, and the pedophile is actually a more sympathetic character than the girl. Even so, the movie lets her ""win"", and one can easily imagine a series of sequels in which she forces any number of evil men to do themselves in. Apparently, as with many other films, the idea of personal, extra-legal revenge still has appeal for some people, even though it represents reversion to a method a addressing evil which has caused untold suffering throughout human history. I maintain that the film is immoral as well as revolting. I advise my friends not even to think of seeing it. I don't think I have ever felt so strongly against a film in my life (I'm 64 years old).",2006
10,"HARD CANDY is one of those films that took enormous courage on the part of the writer (Brian Nelson), director (David Slade), and producers - let alone the actors - to bring a tale of pedophilia to the mainstream audience. Made for a small budget (yet the production values are so very artistic that it feels like an expensive film), HARD CANDY is essentially a duet for two actors: the actors Ellen Page and Patrick Wilson deliver performances that become indelibly burned on the mind of the viewer.",2006
1,"I was very disappointed by this film, especially since the beginning was so promising. Attractive 30 something photographer meets 14 year old girl through chat-room. She turns out to be a kind of avenger for all pedophiles victims and ends up by castrating him and pushing him to hang himself. It's a good idea to have the alleged pedophile played by a young attractive actor but that's about it. Things I found annoying: the girl was so infuriating that I would have liked to see her choke on one of her many wisecracks (like Grace Kelly in Dial M for Murder or Gwyneth Paltrow in just about any film, they are righteous and beautiful, but boy you just wanna squash them like flies). Why do you have to spoil what could be a thought provoking film with irony and smart-ass film references? I do not condone child molestation but I am very very suspicious of teenage girls from Lolita onwards (I am a woman in case you're wondering): violence is always wrong, but is it always violence? What about statutory rape? Isn't this some kind of a legal oxymoron? Ultimately, I would have appreciated a little more exploration of the grey areas that surround the concept of child sexuality and of the boundaries attached to the idea of ""self-service"" justice. I think a little less petulance and sarcasm and a little more empathy and silence would have helped... And, by the way, the cinematography was excellent, but so what? Any MTV director worth his salt could do the same or better. Conclusion: a missed opportunity.",2006
1,"English writing isn't my strongest side, but here goes: I did not appreciate the film. You have to be either a vengeful eunuch or twisted girl to appreciate this creepy, disgusting flick. Who in their right mind could ever condole a 14-year-old girl on a power trip, castrating a man because she feels it is the right thing to do?! Goodness! How would any girl want to watch a lenghty film about a woman getting her breasts and clit removed with a razer blade, because a kid feels like it. You wouldn't. You vigilantes! ""The vigilante knows it is not vengeance they seek, nor even some lending of respectability to the spirit of vengeance. The vigilante is no avenger. The vigilante simply wants punishment, or just deserts, and they want it swift and sure. The only problem is that vigilante justice is sometimes too swift and too sure. Vicious beatings and on-the-spot executions do not fit the crime. The only purpose that vigilantism serves is to turn the tables on those criminals who make victims out of people.""",2006
9,"""Hard Candy"" is about a teenage girl named Hayley (Ellen Page) who likes to surf the web and explore internet dating like most normal teenagers. The film opens up with an instant message chat between Hayley and a much older guy named Jeff (Patrick Wilson). Jeff and Hayley plan to meet up later that day, where their meeting turns into an unexpected series of events. A very intense psychological drama ensues ",2006
3,"After seeing so many ""controversial"" films made outside of Hollywood, this attempt at shock cinema comes across as flat, and somewhat uninteresting. Remember all the ""home invasion"" trash that Hollywood was spewing out in the late 80's into the 90's? Films like ""Fatal Attraction"", ""Hand That Rocks the Cradle"", ""Single White Female"", etc. These were all entertaining, and fun to watch once. But they are not considered 'great cinema'. The controversial topic of pedophilia is used here in an exploitative way to mask the fact that ""Hard candy"" is just another trashy 'home invasion' type film, only without the artistic style that some of those other films had. A teenage girl manipulates a man in his 30's into trusting her and inviting her into his home, where she can turn the tables on him, a guy who Hayley suspects is a child molester. Jeff, the man, played by Patrick Wilson takes a drink offered to him by Hayley, (Ellen Page). Of course the drink is drugged, and Jeff wakes up tied to a chair. Original, huh?Thus begins a series of very predictable cat and mouse games, involving scenario after tired scenario of events that we have seen played out many times before. A big problem with this film is that we can't care about any of these people; Jeff is a creepy, but boring ""photographer"", who likes to photograph young girls, and talk to them on the internet. He has no problem with taking home a girl Hayley's age and giving her alcohol, and letting her disrobe for a sleazy 'photo shoot.' Will Hayley kill this creep, or castrate him? Who really cares? And although Hayley is a teenager, she is way, WAY too tough and too smart to ever become a victim of a sexual predator. In fact she is more informed on the subject of predators and perverts than most adults. Also she is extremely jaded, cold, and calculating to ever elicit sympathy from the viewer. In fact, she was horrible. If she found herself in contact with a possible child molester, than she should have simply called the police. But if she had done that than this stupid movie could not have been made. Truthfully, this 'little girl' has so horrid that by the end of the film I was hoping that Jeff would break free from his restraints and give her a good beating! ""Hard Candy"" depends far too much on it's 'shocking' subject matter to get attention. So much so, that it seems that little thought was put into the actual making of this film. Especially considering the fact that it is not shocking at all. Hollywood has a way of watering down these taboo subjects to make the material suitable for mainstream consumption. From beginning to end, it is poorly and unimaginatively shot. Most of the film takes place in a very bland house. It features not one single frame of creative or artistic camera work or editing in it's entire running time. Ellen Page, although a competent actress, became less believable as the angry, vengeful teenager, as the film went on. And the character Jeff didn't come across as a particularly 'bad guy', or a 'good guy' for that matter. When a film features only two main characters for it's entire running time, than these characters need to be developed beyond the one-dimensional portrayals seen here. Some of the dialog was cringe-inducing, and the ending was pretty unbelievable. I think that the viewers that found this to be a good film, or a shocking film, have never ventured out of the 'mainstream'. They have never heard of directors like Augustin Villaronga, or even Gregg Araki. There are films that touch on similar subjects, in a way that make this Hollywood trash look like an absolute comedy in comparison. There is even a more accessible film, dealing with this 'vengeful Lolita' subject matter; A seldom seen little gem called ""Poison Ivy"", featuring Drew Barrymore as a young vixen who uses her seductive nature to destroy a dysfunctional family. It might be a bit trashy, but it is quite atmospheric, and beautiful to look at. At least that film doesn't pretend to be something other than what it is, and ""Poison Ivy"" actually gives more insight into the mind of a teenager who has some mental problems that are manifested through her overt sexuality. But the character of 'Ivy' is somehow sympathetic, and easier to understand, and to feel something for. Hayley from 'Hard Candy' is as cold and unfeeling as the movie itself. It might sound inappropriate to compare an 'exploitation-type' film like ""Poison Ivy"" with ""Hard Candy"", but actually ""Hard Candy"" is a trash film, masquerading as a more legitimate work. Do not be fooled by the sleek production values here; the film is exploitation, little more. ",2007
3,"I give this a 3 out of 10 just for a 2 seconds of accidental humor, and the one twist which i sort of liked until the movie ended and I realized, ""Hey! That made no friggin sense."" This movie is unbelievable, the actress overacts her part, and the pedophile is such a complete friggin idiot/moron I can't even understand it. Seriously, who crawls at someone with a scalpel in plain sight. I found that more funny and sad then suspenseful. And the Circumcision, how did she know he was going to escape? The bonds were obviously not meant to let him escape or he would've successfully done it the first time. There's no real hero in the movie, just an villain, who they try and make you sympathize, and an anti-hero, who's more sadistic then anything else. For those of you who haven't seen this movie, let me put up a rough synopsis.",2007
8,"This sure is some thriller.Darn those MTV filmmakers,when they really use their heads they show some of their true visual talents.Like the debut made by Mark Romanek in One Hour Photo, David Slade really excels as a director who keeps things extremely intense and gripping with a touch of shocking elements and pure disturbance due to its story.",2006
6,"Well. That was disturbing. Though it is not one to recommend for ""Family Night,"" Hard Candy offers an intriguing one-time viewing thanks to the effectiveness of its two-man show approach.

8,"I saw Hard Candy at the Angelika, in Tribeca New York and never have I been so shocked, surprised and utterly impressed with an acting performance. The storyline, though somewhat confusing was overpowered by the Oscar-winning performance given by Ellen Page, 14-year old Hayley. Though it could have wrapped up a little sooner (it was a bit longer than expected) I would highly recommend this to anyone who has buddies they talk to online, or anyone that generally enjoys suspenseful films. Not to be outdone by the young star, Patrick Wilson gave an excellent performance. The whole movie was a twisted roller coaster of not knowing who to believe. Whether young Hayley was telling the truth, or was she in fact just completely insane, you won't find out until the end, but either way, it was a knockout performance by both stars and a highly recommended film!",2006
1,"*Contains little spoilers, but nothing from the end.*",2007
7,"Hard Candy is a graphic and gripping film without being overly visceral or inflammatory... well maybe just a little.

7,"I just screened this film at LGF last night. I was quite intrigued for the first forty minutes. Then it all kind of fell apart for me. In it's best moments this film explores the complexities of vengeance and psychology. It tries to be clever by pulling a role reversal -- but this eventually wears thin and the dialog becomes didactic and contrived. I still think it is worth seeing for the strength of the leads alone. Patrick Wilson does a fine job as a ""suspected"" pedophile. He elicits both sympathy and disgust. Ellen Page as the young girl is absolutely fantastic. Her performance is brilliant and even frightening at times. She's good even when the script can't match her talent. I look forward to seeing her in many films to come. Finally a young actress who is more than just a pretty face -- I'm so tired of the Natalie Portmans, the Hillary Duffs, and the Jessica Albas of the world. Good luck with your career Ms. Page.",2005
1,"I'd heard from several sources that this movie was great, and the first five-ten minutes had me really intrigued. Unfortunately it was all downhill from there. There was absolutely no character development - I didn't know a damn thing about Jeff or Hayley, so how could I sympathize with either of them? The dialogue was laughable at best - the pretentious ""I'm going to break you down psychologically"" garbage gets really old REALLY quickly. Also, I spent every second after Jeff wakes up tied to the chair wondering when something, anything, was going to happen. Nothing did.",2006
8,"For the most part, films which were intended to frighten the viewing audience usually succeed in instead producing involuntary laughs. So it was nice to see a 'horror' film that not only has a brain for a change, but actually succeeds in being frightening. It may help that the film is allegedly based on true events, which gives credibility to the storyline, and prevents the movie from having those annoyingly gaping plot holes. And indeed, the heading ""Based on a true story"" doesn't come off as a glaring lie. There are indeed events happening in the film which are questionable as to whether they actually occurred in real life, but the beauty of 'Emily Rose' is that most of the film is retold by various characters, so the events described are as the character perceived them. In this way, the film doesn't distance its audience by declaring that ""well, demons were in the film which was 'based on a true story', so demons must actually exist"".",2005
8,"Yes, I know, we've seen too many mediocre horror movies in the past few years. Yes, I'm fed up with horror stories that are ""based on true events"", too, but don't write this movie off too soon.

7,"This is an interesting film. While it's not terribly frightening, the film's juxtaposition of court room drama, and the exorcism scenes are intriguing. I found it to be less of your stereotypical demonic possession movie (ie: The Exorcist), and more of a film that leaves you pondering the possibilities and questioning our more modern perspectives and scientific rationales for things that sometimes can't be adequately explained through these means. The fact that it's based on the reported possession of Anneliese Michel (circa 1970, Germany) does make the film more unnerving. The actor's performances, while not exceptional, are at least engaging. The special effects are rather limited, but well done. All in all, It's a film that 's certainly worth watching.",2005
8,"Ironically enough, ""The Excorcism of Emily Rose"" got released in my country (Belgium) synchronously with another similar, real-life lawsuit. A self-acclaimed exorcist has to justify the death of a young girl after performing inhuman rituals and fatal exorcism tricks. It's weird having seen this movie and then follow the lawsuit on TV and in newspapers. It's so easy to deny the existence of demonic possession and to brush aside exorcism as quackery, but then  as this film shows  you're also questioning people's beliefs and family values. Emily Rose is the sympathetic daughter of a poor but deeply religious rural family. Shortly after her long-anticipated start at the university, her body becomes the host of no less than 6 different demons. The priest of the little town where she lives, father Moore, is doing everything he can to purify Emily's body but the demons are too strong and she doesn't survive the exorcism. What makes this film different than the obvious 70's classic ""The Exorcist"" (which also entirely revolves on the possession of an innocent girl) is that the story takes place after the actual exorcism and in the courtroom where father Moore is on trial for negligent homicide. His ambitious lawyer Erin Bruner goes straight for the acquittal of her client, but father Moore only cares for telling Emily's story, despite the fact that this can cost him his career as a priest. The screenplay of this film was based on a true story and director Scott Derrickson does a great job in making the extended courtroom sequences interesting and compelling. The flashbacks, showing Emily's horrible decrepit, are very atmospheric and contain multiple shock-moments. The acting is sublime, with a powerful Tom Wilkinson as the devoted priest and an enchanting Jennifer Carpenter as the poor Emily Rose. This is not a full-blooded horror film, but definitely one of the most unsettling, disturbing and thought-provoking dramas of the last few years. Highly recommended!",2005
10,"Some people are going to be shocked by the last 15 minutes of the film. It is NOT a remake or bad copy of ""The Exorcist"". That film is truly understandings for reasons that are pretty much its psychological ties to the fears in all of us. In ""Emily Rose"", the emphasis is on our perspectives, and how it affects our choices. Laura Linney is truly phenomenal in the film, and I sure hope she finally receives all the prizes that have eluded in the last few years. As a side note, I have just witnessed the remarkable work by Rachel Weisz in ""The Contant Gardener"", and I have to state my opinion that Ms. Linney is a bit more powerful and effective in her multi-layered performance as the defense attorney.",2005

Thankfully, I have learned that this is how many trailers work, but I still go see a movie praying that I'm not wasting my hard-earned money on a really expensive and really long commercial; let me savor something! I was pleasantly surprised at The Exorcism of Emily Rose; going knowing that it's not only about her exorcism, but also about the trial that follows.This movie is also about alternatives,what ifs, and perceptions.

An awful lot of very talented people worked on this baleful freak-show, all to no avail. Written by Scott Derrickson, who also directed, and Paul Harris Boardman, the story is loosely based on an incident that occurred in Germany, but the usual horror movie clichés are intact: a door opening and closing in a storm, 'scary' shots of feet walking down corridors (to heighten suspense), a pencil case moving by itself, squeaky floors in nearly every house, Emily Rose freaking out during a test in the classroom (complete with a stormy sky outside), the unfortunate girl eating spiders (like Renfield in ""Dracula""), as well as a defense lawyer who is 17 minutes late to court because a demonic force shut off her electricity!

While the acting for the most part is typical teenager and a little disappointing except for the bad guy, the film looks fantastic, the actions sequences are great as well as the kills, some of which were hard to watch due to their realism. In this version at least, the cheesy special effects seem to be gone or at least vastly improved from what the other reviewer saw. It moves pretty well except for a few scenes of obligatory explanations regarding the voodoo deal and ""teen angst"", but there are a couple of really good scares as well as a good sustained overall tension throughout. The kills are brutal for the most part with one exception thats kind of lame, but the fight sequence close to the end is especially effective and looks just great as well as what has to be some new scenes, possibly even a new ending, since the lighting and overall look is so different from the rest of the film, but it still looks great.

But that won't completely stop him, and he begins to kill them one by one as they flee through the swamps in a dash to save their lives.",2006

8,"Why did I give this movie a rating of 8? Because I am a huge horror movie buff who loves slasher movies. This movie is a throwback to the 80's that produced several of these type of films. This film does deserve respect, in the fact it is better than the Friday the 13th film that came after the 3rd one and Halloween films that came after the second one. Its not great but it is pretty good, with good fx, OK acting and some memorable death scenes. This is a slasher movie with a good body count. The killer is well I think better than Jason, at least we like the guy before he becomes a killer and even then you feel sorry for him and like him more. This movie deserved more publicity and abetter chance. Yes it could have used some touch ups on the script but its a fun slasher movie. It deserved better. Way better than the very unscary film called CRY_WOLF. That was well boring and awful. this is a movie for true horror fans especially ones who miss the Rat3ed R days of slasher / horror films. Just remember not fantastic or inspiring than Halloween, Scream or Friday the 13th but its good at hanging with the best of them and to put it nicely if this came out in the early eighties instead of rooting for Jason in the Friday films we'd probably be rooting for this guy in slasher films.",2006

When Ray returns to get the object, many snakes are released from the suitcase, bite him and the car falls in the swamp with him. When the police retrieve the car, his body is completely bitten and deformed. In the morgue, Ray becomes an undead murdering the coroner and a police officer and two teenagers later. The teenager Eden (Agner Bruckner) decides to pay a visit Cece (Meagan Good), the granddaughter of the voodoo priestess, with her friends trying to find an explanation, and they are advised to leave the place, since Ray is possessed by the souls of the most despicable villains milked by her grandmother from sinners.

9,"What's wrong with today's audiences? So what if this movie doesn't have a superb screenplay. I wasn't aware that this genre required it. Do scary film have to either make fun of itself? or is it necessary that it's full of clever lines? I am perfectly happy with the recent ""The Skeleton Key"" and ""Venom"", films that don't have make long unnecessary introductions about what's going on, or why things are going on? Let's just sit and enjoy the ride, and in this case, it'll be a scary one. This film will become a Halloween or cult classic. The chase is relentless, and normal people don't have much of a chance against the unleashed forces.",2005
8,"This is made by some of the main people who brought us I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, and compares favorably to that film and in some ways is better. It has a more novel creation of the slasher set up, it is from the get go a supernaturally based film,which I prefer. It features some of the same atmosphere but more cleverness and Gore than the recent SKELETON KEY. The characters are young and hot but also fleshed out enough that they seem like real people and their deaths are treated with the proper shock and horror. The filmmakers know how to make the villain cool without resulting in making him campy or most importantly forgetting the make him scary--the fact he doesn't speak once he's the villain helps. They set up some nice jeopardy situations and there is some real sacrifice involved. The action is well handled, I guess it has to be said there is no nudity but there is some sex appeal. It is also not a jokey SCREAM type of film--not that SCREAM wasn't good but the rip offs of it have stunk as have most of it's own sequels. This is really well produced, photographed and staged by people who know how to make a film like this be scary and exciting. There are a couple of missteps and continuity gaps but they are really pretty minor. There are big limits to the slasher genre but if you're a fan of it definitely see this movie, which already seems to be getting no respect from its distributor.",2005
6,"Of course this is no genre classic but once you've seen some more typical slasher flicks of this decade, you have to conclude that this movie is not all too bad in the long run. Nothing too memorable but just good enough to watch it.",2008

7,"I rented this DVD because  let's face it  there is nothing good out there and it doesn't look like the situation is going to improve any time soon I was ready for a generic, mindless tubetop slasher film and this is exactly what I got. The girl actors are pretty and interchangeable and have been chosen for their ability to fill a pushup bra and emote using puffed-up lips curled into an uncomprehending trapeze-shape expression throughout. The downhome bayou atmospherics are provided by exquisite location photography worthy of the ""Jeepers Creepers"" franchise (and an Oscar nomination), bolstered by an incredibly high bitrate on DVD, and stupendous audio landscapes that deserve a feature-length film by themselves and more than make up for the rental price. As usual in this kind of film, the confusion persists between native New Orleans hoodoo and imported Haitian (in this case) voodoo. Every other supernatural aspect is invented and sounds as false as the faux Creole lingo used without the benefit of a dialect coach. The main character of Ray is greatly enhanced by the solid presence of Rick Cramer who can boast macho gay porno movie star good looks but here wears a scar on his left cheek, which, of course, makes him ""creepy"". The ""F"" and ""S"" words are used more than a hundred times in various creative combinations during the 88 minutes of action, which manages to include a girl-boy misunderstanding subplot, a trailer-trash-mallrat-sluts-getting their-comeuppance scene and a drunk-teen-oedipal-revolt-against-the-father-image mini-scene, three devices which are now probably required by law in this kind of entertainment. The end result is a rather superior sadistic romp that is way ahead of its generic counterparts in terms of production values but thankfully remains miles removed from the record-breaking degeneracy of the current box-office smash ""Hostel"", which, by all reports, cannot be topped when it comes to gross-out, morbidly soul-destroying chills. And that, in our imperfect world, is just the way it should be.",2006
9,"Indeed it must have taken someone with a wide imagination to think up this plot (im serious ). After dieing a man who is known a the town weirdo goes after the granddaughter of the voodoo woman who caused his death after saving her life. He comes back to life a reeks havoc amongst a group of small town teens, and anyone in his path. At first I wasn't expecting much, but I got more than I expected. Venom will keep you watching and interested from start to finish with the exception of the first few minutes of the film where you meet the characters, who hang out around the local burger shop. I must say many parts of this film kept me in suspense, and I was frightened at many parts. This movie was like Land of the Dead meets the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Cry_Wolf was a better all around film but this was still one of the best movies i've seen in a while. This movie also has a numerous amount of creative and gory deaths along with some frightening scenes. Some examples are a missing corpse, a shattered window, a crowbar stabbing, a hanging body, a car garage chase, an overturned car, a stab in the leg, a chain through he wall, a creepy truck, a chain around the neck, a slit throat, voodoo rituals, a collapsing house,a tree branch through the chest, a creepy swamp,a knife in the head, and more are including in this gory thriller that will surely keep you entertained and in suspense. Gillesepie did a good job with I Know What You Did Last Summer, and he surely showed his skills directing this movie.",2005
6,"Venom Dimension 2005 color 85 minutes Horror-Thriller Agnes Bruckner, Johnathan Jackson, Laura Ramsey, D.J. Cotrona, Rick Cramer, Megan Good, Bijou Phillips, Method Man, Pawel Szajda and Stacey Travis star. Directed by Jim Gillespee Written by Brandon Boyce and Flint Dille Produced by Kevin Williamson Rated R for strong language, graphic violence and lots of gore Miramax's genre division Dimension has to be the absolute dumbest company. It's true what you've heard Venom is no masterpiece but it's far from being a disaster. It's a decent film with some great scenes and ideas. It would've certainly been a bankable film. Definitely an audience film, filled with Oh my God frantic jolts, sweaty palm inducing suspense and loads of dumb character stereotypes we've all grown to love. Because without them horror movies just wouldn't exist. So dimension finished this film and fast tracked it for a September release instead of taking a bit more time to develop it slightly and marketing it better so people actually know it exists. I mean why even bother making it if your not going to promote it. Well anyways, on to the movie Venom is a fun little thrill ride. The story is a little contrived ringing continuously true out of I know what you did last summer land mixed with the skeleton key and just a dash of Texas Chainsaw. Massacre. As the film begins we are introduced to a bunch of annoying kids all of whom you pretty much want to die except for a few cute guys. There is a town bad ass named Ray whom the kids tease and one night while riding her bike(because she's saving money for med school) home Eden (By far the worst name for a white character or anyone for that matter) has a run in with her ex boyfriend because of college reasons and becomes part of an accident involving a creepy old woman, Ray and a devilish suitcase. A suitcase that holds a group of snakes that hold the souls of the worst of men murderers, rapists, etc. So ray gets bit a lot before drowning and comes back as an uber human killer trying desperately to get to the old womans grand daughter and the group of friends for no particular reason. There's lots of fun stuff thrown in including loud sound effects,sparklingly clear cinematography, unexpected scares and some creative death sequences. All of that makes for a great but not completely memorable time. It's substance in where the film's major problem lies. It doesn't really have any. We don't know the characters and they're all horrible actors reacting wrongly to the situations. There is no real plot development or story buildup so it's hard to care for anyone or even know whats going on. The film also comes equipped with that annoying flashy editing that I hate so much. However the good outweighs the bad and Venom makes for a fun night out at the movies especially with a date. The main villain is haunting, and the cast is full of hot guys adorable Johnathan Jackson from Tuck Everlasting, Sexy D.J. Cotrona from TV's short lived but excellent series Skin. And last but not least Pawel Szajda that hunky young man from Under the Tuscan sun. The girls are less memorable some of them are mildly attractive and Bruckner does badly as the film's heroine but kicks it up a slight notch in the last reel. And about the last reel, this film has a killer last reel. It's quite Brutal filled with edgy, grainy cinematography reminiscent of 70's horror films. So all in all go into Venom with mediocre expectations and expect to be entertained . It's been quite a while since I've seen so many horror films(House of wax, Chainsaw remake, Dawn remake, exorcism of Emily rose, Hellbent, etc.) with such a brutal bite as the ones they've been releasing. It reminds of me of the 80's when I grew up it was a damn fun time! Keep'em coming guys! ***(out of five)",2005
2,"We've all seen them, films that you know instinctively what is about to happen. Someone hides in a room as the bad guy is there then hears their footsteps fade away and so they go out and ""Oh""..they are dead... How about a film that is so generic that before 5 minutes have passed you know who will live, who will die and who the bad guy is? Sound interesting? Then you will love Venom. Venom is one of those films that if you have seen any other film of this genre (The horror Slasher) you can know before hand exactly what to expect. It is genericism on a whole new level. It starts nicely enough with the snakes and for one moment you think this could be a good supernatural horror then you realise it is in fact just Friday the 13 th all over again! Seriously, the bad guy is literally Jason Vorhees minus the mask! So all in all.....avoid like the black death unless you like your films as shallow as a paddling pool!",2005
4,"Overall it was a watchable movie. I didn't pause it or stop it to come back to it--a clear sign of a boring movie--so it passed the first test. Best of all, it got into the story fast, no boring unneeded back story for the characters.",2006
1,"I saw this movie at a free NYC screening back in June , And I must say that this movie totally sucks. Such a recycled plot, characters look like they had stepped out of a WB TV show. The Reaper looks like Dolf Lundren bathed in mud(totally z grade special effects). All the death scenes weren't even scary or funny , except one which involves as speeding truck and a tree impalement. I hated this movie along with everybody at the screening. I give it two big watery bowels down!! What horror movies need is a hard R rating, Mature characters, and brutal death scenes that do not shy away from the screens.",2005
7,"Rather than fight yet another war with Hollywood (see: ""Brazil"", ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen"", and ""The Man Who Killed Don Quixote""), Terry Gilliam took off his gloves and allowed the Weinsteins and Miramax to force their will upon him. With his new film ""Tideland"" coming out soon, Gilliam chose to focus his efforts on molding it, while allowing ""The Brothers Grimm"" to go wherever the studio wanted to take it. The result is by far the most commercial film to Gilliam's name, but in this case watered-down Gilliam is better than no Gilliam, and his first film in seven years (""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" in 1998) is a fun one.",2005
7,"Well, my friends, I have just returned from the earliest possible showing of ""Brothers Grimm"" in my area, and I can assure you it was well worth getting up a few hours earlier than usual to watch. However, I would caution anyone who doesn't like Terry Gilliam's work, Matt Damon and Heath Ledger, or the REAL brothers Grimms' stories that this is not your average fantasy. The story is set in french-occupied Germany in the 1700s, a real time in which real people actually lived. Even some of the magical aspects of the story are explained by real events (I won't spoil it for you). So quite a bit of the plot deals with the realities of the day and age along with the fantastical aspects of the forest and its inhabitants.",2005
6,"Being a fan of both good old-fashioned fantasy movies and of director Terry Gilliam, I was really looking forward to this one. I was slightly put off when I heard Gilliam's complaints about the constant interference of the Brothers Weinstein, but the director does have a history of being dissatisfied with the production of projects which actually turn out pretty good in the end, so my hopes were still pretty high.",2005
9,"Like his Baron Munchhausen, Gilliam's Brothers Grimm has been horridly misunderstood by critics and public alike. What I get from the comments and reviews is the sense of thwarted expectations, although I have little idea what the anti-Grimms expected in the first place. People dislike the kitten scene because it's a cute kitten. This I find entirely in the grotesque spirit of the original folk tales. We've learned to take our fairy tales Disneyfied, apparently. I've also heard complaints about the quality of the special effects as sub-ILM quality. Frankly, that's what I liked about them. They *didn't* look like ILM; they looked personal. I admit I found the basic premise a cliché (two con men who make their living on the superstitious gullible find out that, in this case, the magic is real), but its working-out overcomes this basic flaw. This is a movie that shuns cliché. The brightest scenes, for example, almost always contain the greatest menace. Relative safety is drab, dirty, brutish, nasty, and short. Ledger gives an amazing performance -- I had previously regarded him as a Troy Donahue update. Matt Damon shows he has the chops to cross over from small ""indies"" to big performances in the old leading-man vein. Peter Stromare and Jonathan Pryce do a highbrow Martin & Lewis -- Stromare all over the place and Pryce coolly self-contained -- to hilarious effect. The faces alone in this movie are wonderful, hearkening back to the glory days of Leone. There are so many telling details in the background (""Bienvenue a Karlstadt"") -- let alone the foreground -- that show Gilliam's mastery. Harry Potter (which I enjoyed), Lord of the Rings, and Chronicles of Narnia are for the kiddies and show us worlds we can, with effort, control. Gilliam doesn't offer any such comfort, not even at the end. The sense of menace is overwhelming, and Gilliam achieves it without super-special effects, usually camera movement (the shots following Little Red Riding Hood through the forest made my jaw drop). A brilliant film, operating at a high level we don't see much of these days. Someone compared the movie to Burton's Big Fish, another film dismissed or ignored by critics and public. Although Burton's and Gilliam's sensibilities differ, I take the writer's point. The confident, poetic handling of myth and archetype in both astonishes.",2006
3,"The beginning of this movie sucked me in and I really wanted to see how it all came together. As the movie went on though, I found it getting progressively worse. Everything that was a special effect in the movie was CGI and poorly done CGI at that. I could understand the wolf standing on two legs, but trees are CGI and spider webs are CGI. It just got so ridiculous I started to lose interest. Everyone's character is over the top without any point to it. The references to the grimm tales was really the only thing in this movie that seemed like they put thought into it (at first), but then they got sloppy with even that.",2006

4,"People have a curious tendency not to notice how bizarre and gruesome children's fairy tales often are. Terry Gilliam's ""The Brothers Grimm"" does notice.

If your answer to any of the above questions is ""yes,"" and you are willing to suspend disbelief (because boy is this movie inconsistent if you actually think about it) this film will provide an entertaining diversion. It's funny, interesting, exciting, and even a little scary (so don't bring your little children if they get scared easily).",2005
1,"The Brothers Grimm was extremely disappointing. I love Terry Gilliam movies, so I was excited to see this, but there is very little Terry Gilliam-like about this film. The jokes (although constantly attempted) are never funny, and the script in general needs some serious help. The movie starts out well enough with the Brothers Grimm as con-artists, duping townspeople into paying a small fortune to have a witch vanquished. It could have been a very good movie if it continued along this path. Instead, it degenerates into a plot of loosely thrown together bits of fairy tails and amateurish acting. The whole tough-girl-who-knows-what-she's-doing-but-still-needs-to-be-rescued thing with ""the Cursed"" is so played out and tired that it's almost sad. And the townspeople call her ""the Cursed"" because her father and sisters were killed? That hardly warrants spitting after saying her name (another tired joke)!!! The worst is saved for last with a happy ending that is SO not out of a Grimm fairy tale. It makes you wonder... has anyone working on this movie actually read any of the Brother's Grimm's work? Or did they just see the Disney version?",2005

You'll find yourself listing the fairy stories as they either are told or happen. Glorious. Set in the Germany of Napoleonic France, the Brothers are set a task by the Delatombe (Jonathon Pryce), the Brothers find themselves inside an enchanted town beset by a supernatural evil that they must overcome despite interference by their French watcher and the French Army.

6,"Squabbling brothers in France-occupied Germany circa 1811 have manufactured a heroic image for themselves as witch-hunters and tall-tale tellers, but when a decrepit witch in an enchanted forest begins stealing maidens for their youthful blood, the duo find themselves up against real evil for the first time. Terry Gilliam-directed fantasy has incredible production values, cinematography and scoring (not to mention two appealing lead performances by Matt Damon and Heath Ledger), yet it takes a good hour to get this picture off the ground. The narrative is heavy-going and, while not a hodgepodge, the film could certainly use a bit more heart and soul rather than CGI effects. Gilliam's handling takes on a more robust, old-fashioned flavor in the second hour, and the movie improves tremendously as a result. The witch's palace (set atop a skyscraper tree) is dazzling, and the initial entrance into her raven-laden lair is deliciously giddy. Jonathan Pryce is well-cast as an evil general who attempts to torch the two men in an impressive forest fire, however the charm of the piece (and the glue holding the adventure together) lies with Damon and Ledger, and they are by turns wily, funny, strapping, childish, and heroic. **1/2 from ****",2007

2,"I suppose I've had it in for Terry Gilliam for some time. Like Tim Burton he brings a terrific graphical sensibility... I don't say visual as that might suggest some approval of the net effect of frames in succession. But both of them ought to be working as a component of a production crew under other directors, because they can't provide a satisfying narrative. ""The Brothers Grimm"" is shrill, mentally badgering, but ultimately toothless. It contains many ideas which I decline to call interesting but certainly could have been stepping stones to better ideas; either more coherent or simply more evocative. I don't mind chaos on film at all; this isn't a problem of me not ""getting it."" As I explained to my bewildered wife, ""I get it, but it sucks."" Doubtless there are many other would-be auteurs who are great visual stylists. Perhaps some of them have an understanding of the theory of moving images and sound assembled as entertaining narrative. One of them should have Terry Gilliam's ability, such as it is, to get films made.

So I, along with one of the other managers, ran this movie and watched it with the kids. It was, by far, the worst movie I have seen in several years. By the end of the movie, only 15 people out of 40 hadn't left. The story can only be described as incomprehensible idiocy. Even thinking back, I can't actually figure out how many of the events that took place in the movie fit together. It seemed like someone walked on the set one day after most of the movie had been filmed and said ""You forgot to put these fairy tales in, I don't care how you do it or whether or not it makes sense, but put them in."" Awful. Just plain awful. Even writing this review down makes me feel lost and scared.",2005

3,"From director Terry Gilliam (Brazil, The Fisher King, Twelve Monkeys), at the time of release from the clips I had seen I could tell this wasn't going to be anything that would get critics excited, I watched to see what I would think. Basically the Brothers Grimm, Wilhelm (Matt Damon) and Jacob (Heath Ledger), are a pair of cons who trick people into paying money to get rid of their fake ghosts or witches haunting them, and they travel around Germany doing this. However when people believe that they really can get rid of these demons and monsters, they hire them to get rid of possibly real ones, only to be arrested for their crime of fraud by the French army, led by General Delatombe (Jonathan Pryce). He lets them go on the deal that they do rid the villagers of these strange occurrences, including young girls, one wearing a red riding hood, kidnapped and taken into the woods, and a brother and sister following a trail and disappearing. As time goes by, and joined by a female companion, they realise that these creatures are indeed real and create threat towards innocent people, but in the end of course they are defeated, and the Wilhelm and Jacob go on to write great fairy tales based on their experiences. Also starring Monica Bellucci as Mirror Queen, Lena Headey as Angelika, Peter Stormare as Cavaldi, Mackenzie Crook as Hidlick, Richard Ridings as Bunst, Alena Jakobova as Red Hooded Girl, Martin Svetlik as Hans and Denisa Vokurkova as Greta. Damon and Ledger do alright with their English accents and good looks, you can recognise the moments from the real brothers' most famous fairy tales, such as The Frog Prince, Rapunzel, Hansel and Gretel, Little Red Riding Hood and Sleeping Beauty, and the special effects for the creatures and action seem fine, but that it is all you can say really, it is a pretty pointless and silly film otherwise, a disappointing period fantasy adventure.

Waiting is the best, most accurate, most honest, and most riotously funny movie ever made about the service industry. Here's how I see it  the world is divided into two groups of people: those who have waited tables and those who haven't. Those who have never worked a day of their lives in a restaurant may find this movie amusing, but they'll think it's too absurd to be real, and they'll probably never give a second thought to this movie ever again.",2005

Most of all, it'll make you think twice about eating at another restaurant or even working at one. Each character is throughly enjoyable as is each interaction between them. It's extremely well-written and realistic. As a waitress, I found it completely therapeutic, because even though I'd never do anything to a customer's food, seeing someone else do it to someone who is deserving of it (even in a movie), is enough to make me feel better. Ryan Reynolds is hysterical in this movie, as is Dane Cook and Luis Guzman. There are so many one-liners that you'll hear for a long time, especially in the kitchen of any restaurant. It ends slightly abruptly and you find yourself wanting more...but I guess that means the writer has done something right. Go see it, and enjoy.

I can't believe they actually made a movie showing all the things that servers, cooks, dishwashers, hostess', and managers all do in a day's time. I actually went to see this movie twice in theaters and can't wait for the day that it comes out on DVD so I can own it.

10,"In 'Waiting' Ryan Reynolds plays Monty, the seemingly head waiter at a Shenanigan's restaurant. Monty hates his job, like most, but he is like a god at Shenanigan's and gets away with almost anything. His bud and roommate Dean (Justin Long) is just a little more dissatisfied, but starts to see things in perspective once he is offered an assistant manager position.",2005
10,"FINALLY! A movie about young adults working at a restaurant. I am 21 and I've only worked in restaurants. Since I was 15, I've been a busser, dishwasher, host, or a cook. And I have to say that this movie is 100%, dead-on accurate. Not only was it flawlessly written and the actors were natural and likable, but it also shows the people the other side. People don't realize all the B.S. servers and cooks have to go through every single day. So, the next time you chew out a server because your steak is medium instead of medium-rare, just remember one thing...We control your food, we can do whatever we want to it. So, chill out and remember it's only food and it's not the end of the world.",2005
9,"The people at Shenanigan's restaurant are an old mix of characters, never making their jobs boring by the amount of shenanigans of their own. Mitch is just starting and is taking the tour with Monty. Monty is the friendly yet crazy work mate, making every moment at fun one. Dean has hit a rut and questions why he still works at Shenanigan's, and cant commit with a fellow employee Amy. Dean was also asked if he wanted the assistant manager spot; to much of the content of others. Serena and Monty were dating, but they have a friendship on fake smiles and sarcasms.",2005
2,"Jerk off waiters, waitresses, and other restaurant staff spew sophomoric humor for people who've never seen foul-mouthed comedies (or get off on them). The running joke, herein, is something called ""The Penis Game"" - you trick co-workers into looking at your exposed genitals. Then, if they look at your worm, you shout ""fag!"" and playfully kick their ass. Note, the ""Unrated and Raw"" DVD shows squat.",2009
8,"I remember that when this movie came out in theatres, people didn't really know what to expect. And of coarse the movie bombed in the theatres. Well when I bought this movie, I watched it and realized that it is accurate, very funny and over really good. I have worked in a restaurant myself and I know all the sick things that some chefs would actually do. This movie just goes in depth on a day-in-the-life, of normal people working in a small restaurant. It shows when the day begins, all the way to the end of the shift. Another thing about this movie that made it so funny was a game that the men of the restaurant played. This game involves making somebody ""unwillingly"" look at their package down below. Well as you can see, the movie is hilarious and I definitely recommend it.",2006
6,"In many ways this movie can be compared to another successful cult comedy by the name of ""Office Space"". Both films are about what really happens in a stressful working environment. While ""Office Space"" and ""Waiting"" do share similar plots, first time director Rob McKittrick seems to have more of a flare for slacker comedy than Mike Judge.",2005
9,"I saw this movie with my friend and his girlfriend in theaters. I had never heard of it before then. I was not disappointed. It is basically a day in the life of restaurant workers. The whole movie takes place in one day. Meanwhile, there is a new guy there who doesn't say much throughout the whole thing, and you can tell how awkward he feels being the new one, we've all been there before.",2006
1,"This film is by one of the worst movies I have seen this year. It is so quick to play the slapstick, immature humor that it doesn't allow the humor to really build. It tries to follow in the same breath of the likes of ""Office Space"" and ""Clerks"", but it falls well short. I admit, I did chuckle here and there, but overall I was the only person in the theater laughing the least. I cannot recommend this film.",2005
2,"After watching this movie about a ""day in the life of a restaurant,"" I couldn't understand the high rating it gets on IMDb, but then I noticed that most of the reviewers are former wait-persons who identified with the over-the-top caricatures of the staff and customers of these restaurants.",2006
1,"This is not normally the kind of movie I watch. I rented this movie on the recommendation of some of the kitchen workers at the restaurant where I am a waitress. I should have known better. They said it was ""hilarious"", ""funny as s*#t"", among other ""outstanding"" comments. The only reason I sat through till the end was to wait for the funny parts that were NEVER forthcoming. I did feel that some of the portrayals of the customers were realistic. If people were to see this movie and feel the whole as an accurate portrayal of the waiting profession, which I hope normal people would have the sense to figure out is not the case, I would be out of a job. If you like stupid, mindless ""humor"", see this movie. I feel that it insults a profession that I happen to take very seriously and pride myself on. This movie was a waste of my time and money.",2006
1,"When you sit down to watch a comedy that you think may have potential to be really genuine, hilarious, and have some crude adult humor thrown in beware, it may turn out to be a total stinker like ""Waiting..."". I thought the idea of the setting, an everyday boisterous steakhouse, and the comedy of Ryan Reynolds would make this a hit, but the film blows on every level. The plot is non-existent, there are no jokes, the single attempt at any comedy (I won't spoil it, as if I could spoil anything about this crapper) is beyond childish and is used over and over throughout this 90+ minute root canal. Stereotypical, lame, and stupid are just a few words that come to mind.",2006
1,"Having worked in a restaurant, I have NEVER seen any of these things happen (the messing with the food). But then again, I never worked at a restaurant like THAT. This movie just confirms that it was a good idea that I never worked in a restaurant like that and it confirms why I never wanted to make a career out of waiting tables! Some of us are just more professional than that. Besides all of that, this movie was NOT funny. It lacked wit, which makes sense, since it's a movie based in a restaurant and most people that work there lack wit as well. Sad, but true. There is no plot, no humor, lacked talent, and I was really surprised to see that the actors chose to take the roles. Hopefully, it won't hurt their career. Save your money and time and don't watch this.",2006
1,"When I first read about ""Waiting"" a few months ago, I kind of wanted to see the film because it sounded pretty interesting plus it starred Justin Long who usually is very good and Anna Faris who although always plays the same character in every movie is still pretty likable. Anyway, about a month or so ago I saw the trailer for the film and it completely turned me off. I went on my usual movie site IMDb.com and stated that the trailer looked like crap. This is when the director Rob McKittrick told me to watch the film before I commented on it, so I wrote the director back telling him that I promised not to say anything else about the film until I saw it. So today, Tuesday October 11, 2005 I went to my local multiplex and watched ""Waiting"" ",2005
10,"I went to see this opening day with two of my friends, one of which works in the catering business with me. While watching this movie, we were able to characterize every single person in the movie with someone at our work (and yes, the petiphile Monty can be related to someone at my work). The movie was perfect, I laughed the entire time. The actors and actresses in this movie were absolutely perfect, Ryan Reynolds and Dane Cook stole the show. Unlike the movie, we have games at our work, but nothing to that extreme. If you have worked or are working in the service industry, then this is your Office Space...go see it as soon as you can.",2005
9,"I am SO not the demographic for this movie, but a friend invited me to the premiere, so I went. I found myself laughing ridiculously from beginning to end. Yeah, it's disgusting. Yeah, it's not going to win an Oscar. But that's not the point. This is one of those films that will be quoted by restaurant workers (and their friends) for years to come, and will enhance the DVD collections of many college and 20-something guys. It looked like it was a blast to make, and that energy carries over onto the screen. It's much more entertaining than some recent films that cost 100 times what this one did. Kudos to these guys for getting it made. (And who's the cute dark-haired guy who plays the patron who wants to name his daughter ""Chlamydia""?)",2005
7,"To the people who have never worked a day in a restaurant, this movie is NOT for you. To the people who go to a restaurant and treat the staff like $hit, This movie is NOT for you either. Trust me, save yourself the realization of just what you've REALLY eaten, cuz your life will be much better if you never find out. For everyone else, this movie is perfect. Its never going to win any awards, and doesn't even try to. From the 5-second rule to the intermingled sex lives of the staff to the retarded manager, this movie hits the nail right on the head. It seems like someone in Hollywood finally got some money to throw around and decided to pay homage to his life before being ""Someone"" in Hollywood. I laughed till i cried through the first 30 minutes and the rest of the movie was just as good. It's destined to become a cult classic for anyone in The Industry and will definitely be on my bookshelf the day it comes out. As long as you go in only with expectations of being grossed out and laughing till it hurts, you will not be disappointed!!",2005
8,"The script was an excellent read. It made me laugh out loud on several different occasions, and I can't even remember the last BOOK that did that, much less the last screenplay. What's even better is that before I saw the cast list, I was thinking that a Ryan Reynolds-type actor would be perfect in the role of Monty. To my surprise (and utter delight), Reynolds was actually cast in the role. Perfect.",2005
1,"With a wide range for stupid humor, this one falls outside my standards by a lot. I was a little surprised to find out that most of the funny stuff was shown in video trailers. Also disappointed that Ryan Reynolds could stoop this low for work, he, IMHO is better, and I have seen better from him, and hope it's soon. In Amnityville Horror, his role was good, it shows some versatility, but he seems better in comedic roles, where he acts more at home to me, more at ease. His role in Blade Trinity was good also. My thoughts are that this movie was/is the bottom of the barrel and all copies should be destroyed except one to show others they should stay away from crap like this. My rating is a 1, if I could have rated any lower, I would have.",2006
9,"OK, so this film has been pretty much railroaded in to a small theatrical release but is destined to become a cult classic along the lines of Kevin smith's mallrats. years from now this will be the disc that kids in blockbuster will be begging their parents to rent for them, or that will be passed under the desk at school. the reason for this is that it taps in to the typical slacker-minimum wage psyche like no other film i have seen, and as a result is my favourite comedy film for years. OK, so as i too am an underachieving malcontent i may be slightly pre-disposed to it's humor but if you like American pie and other films of the gross out genre then you will love it!",2005

6,"Well, it's not the worst superhero movie I've ever seen. 'Elektra' first, last, and most importantly, has Jennifer Garner. Not only is she an angular beauty, the star of TV's ""Alias"" is a terrific athlete (although I guess her stunt woman is even better) and she's not lacking for charisma either. And, luckily, a good friend with the power of God brought her back to life after that jerk Colin Farrell killed her in 'Daredevil'. Comic book fans might have been begging for a spin-off of her 'Daredevil' character, but was anyone else? I saw the movie because of who was playing Elektra and that's it. She may not be the next Hepburn (either one), but she sure is pretty.",2005
6,"OK, I'll confess, this movie is definitely junk food for the mind, like eating a twinkie - but it is fun to watch Well, what can I say. We can't always be discriminating and intellectual in our attempts to probe the artistic complexities engaged in the artform of film.",2010
4,Perhaps I'm out of date or just don't know what Electra is like in current publications... But the Electra that I read was far more manipulative and always seems to have a plan. She usually used others to do her dirty work and more often than not some sort of double cross was involved. Just when you think you have it all figured out she pull the wool over your eyes and gets her way.,2005

Although she died in the former movie she returns thanks to her mentor and Sensei (Terence Stamp) . Elektra is resurrected and turns into a fearless warrior who survives a near-death experience ,her slickness is the result of a childhood accident , which means through the ordinary back-tale where a bad guy dispatch her mummy . The heroine becomes an assassin-for-hire in red-leathers and using her magic daggers , she tries to protect her two latest targets, a single father and his troubled young daughter , a rebellious bratty fourteen years old named Abby (Kristen Prout), from a group of supernatural assassins.

But Elektra battles her emotions and takes on and kick ass the ¨Hand corporation¨ (ruled by Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa) along with its hoodlums . At the end takes place an epic facing off between Elektra and nasty Kirigi ( Will Yun Lee) and partners , as demolishing the man mountain stone , bendy-guy Kinkou , the Animalistic Tattoo and decease-dealing typhoid (Natassia Malthe, subsequently Uwe boll's fetish actress playing Bloodrayne II and against 3º Reich) .",2011
9,"I have never really understood all the dislike for Elektra. In my opinion, it was wonderful entertainment and complete fun to watch. All the action was awesome, and the script was very different and very interesting. Now, I never read the comic books to Marvel movies so I have no idea what people might be getting at on that level, but even if I did, I would try to see the movie on two perspectives: How it works as an adaptation and how it works as a movie itself. Surely this one conjured up enough points in one or both for you to consider it decent at best. I like it way more than Daredevil.",2008
7,"I'm not a comic fan, so I know nothing about this character. However, I found the movie to be action-packed and very entertaining.",2005
10,"I loved the look of Elektra; the dark, grisly feel is such homage to the comic. I also loved how some of the scenes reminded me so much of favorite panels from the comics. I loved how the film depicted Elektra and how she was in conflict with herself. I thought there was a lot of depth in Garner's portrayal. She even surprised me. There are exceptional martial arts sequences in ""Elektra"", including spectacular kali and escrima stick moves. Key scenes include the first conflict at the cabin and the final showdown with the main villain. Overall nice movie, I just wish they had went with the ""R"" rating and traded in some of that dopey green fog for blood.",2005
6,"As a fan of Marvel Universe I found that I liked this movie. I suggest people not familiar with Elektra, The hand, or other aspects of the Marvel plot lines stay away from this movie. Having the knowledge from the comics I was able to fill in the plot holes and just enjoy the movie. I liked the visual aspects of the movie which includes the special effects, settings, and Jennifer Garner. I thought that some of the bad guys were unnecessary. They should have just stuck with one or two bad guys and spent more time defining them. What was the point of the big bullet proof guy? All in all I didn't feel ripped off after seeing the movie. I got my $6.50 worth.",2005
8,"Elektra is probably one of the most underrated films this year. Jennifer Garner is sexy, exciting and great as Elektra and Terrance Stamp is great as Stick. While the film seemed rushed, it was entertaining and fun to watch. Several scenes even had me wondering ""what's going to happen?"" And aren't we supposed to get into films? The action and fight scenes are just spectacular, and Jennifer shows her amazing fighting techniques throughout. The film does suffer from being too short, though. It should've gone longer into back-story But overall, I have to give it up to Rob Bowman for making a film that is fun, exciting and just plain entertaining. I totally recommend this action-packed thrill ride of a film.",2005
8,"Excellent action film despite my aversion for superhero chick flicks. Jennifer Garner as the title character brings a lot to the role. Her ability to switch between a combat-mode warrior and emotionally-damaged woman is superb. The rest of the other characters except for actress Kirsten Prout (Abby Miller) are semi-formed as if they were put in just so Elektra has someone to interact with or beat up. Ms. Prout's performance was excellent in her portrayal of the novice-prodigy that Elektra tries to protect. I expect to see even greater things from this young lady in the future. The fight scenes were a appropriate blend of real photography and FX. The script was good too as it forced Elektra to face increasingly difficult situations while still trying to confront her own inner demons. Gave this an ""8"" and I hope there is a sequel with Garner and Prout!",2005
10,"People should go and see this movie irrespective of the terrible reviews it is getting. I just don't think it deserves them at all. There are some really well choreographed sequences and it has quite a bit of feeling and emotion put into the way the characters are portrayed. I would say that it isn't for kids - we had a row of 10 of them behind us and all they did was talk. So it's obviously too slow for them. It's a very well constructed film and Jen Garner is absolutely magic in the lead. The enemy assassins are maybe slightly less well thought out but they aren't so bad. I just feel that this movie is getting a hard time for no good reason. So, DO NOT believe the terrible press; go and see it and make up your own mind.",2005

I mean, when she stabbed the dude on the roof with her sai...that was bloody brilliant. I loved that scene, and I am still thinking about it. It had a nice amount of action, though not enough. I would've loved to see Jennifer in the signature outfit more than twice. Also, with how the villains were thought up, that was also nice. I liked how Elektra kept having flashbacks of her mother's death, and how the image of Kirigi slowly sifted in. The fighting was incredible. The actress who had the privilege of playing Abby Miller was awesome. I read this in another review and, yes, the colors are absolutely terrific. The lip-locking scene between Typhoid Mary and Elektra was beautiful. I mean, the detail of how there was a ring of dead leaves around Elektra. Truly remarkable and artistic. The feud with Typhoid and Abby was great, too.",2005
10,"The Movie ""Elektra"" picks up where it's left off in the first film ""Daredevil"". This movie is exciting and i really enjoyed it! It's like you're in the movie with Elektra. You feel her pain as she remembers her past. I would watch this movie over and over and never get tired of seeing her kicking butt!! For ""DareDevil' fans or just Jennifer Graner's fans this would be a great choice. Jennifer Garner acts so good in this movie. The fight scenes are incredible, as you watch this beautiful assassin fighting the bad guys. Elektra is a master in this movie. She is one of the best female heroines that i have ever seen. I would give 9/10! The only bad thing is that Ben Affleck is nowhere to be seen! I love Marvel films. ""Elektra"" is a killer, and i recommend it!!",2005
10,"If you like most of the Marvel movies that have come out recently, then you should enjoy Elektra. It is better then the Daredevil, Hulk, Punisher and just below X-Men and Spider-man. The villains were perfectly casted, I only wish they had longer fight scenes. The locations were awesome and the lighting was great. The biggest problem here is that a lot if important info is left out IE Who are the villains, What is the story behind the Good vs Evil battle, Why was Elektra's mom targeted and other stuff. Like I said, my main complaint is that the villains didn't get enough face time, and we didn't get to find out why they were there and their story. Anyways, ignore these haters and go see this movie.",2005
9,"Jennifer Garner as Elektra is just amazing she is so beautiful and she makes the character her own. The effects are good, the enemies are good and the story is good a really underrated Marvel Movie. There's a really great deleted scene where Ben Affleck reprises his role as Matt Murdock and he visits Elektra as a dream and it was really great it should made the final cut. This film and Daredevil deserved a sequel too bad they never happened. At the end Elektra is not as great as Daredevil but still is a good film and it's a lot better than other superhero movies like Catwoman and Batman & Robin. A 9 out of 10 for me i liked it a lot.",2015

9,"Cronenberg's adaptation of a Wagner and Locke graphic novel places a simple American family man, and his all-American family, into a new and disturbing context which has them questioning everything they think they know. Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) owns a little diner in a small town and has a nice house on the outskirts of town, where he and his wife Edie (Maria Bello) raise their two kids apparently living the American dream in their own way. One day at the diner, two murderers pop by at closing time for some cherry pie, and Tom's heroic defense of his diner, his customers and himself sets off a series of events that threaten his family, his sanity and his life. The eerie tension never lets up in this powerful examination of identity, honesty and violence.",2006
10,"I expected bloody senselessness and instead saw a film laden with the deepest human emotions. It was real. From youthful loving to hard violence, from simple innocent joys to the full depth of adult violence and sex, and ultimate redemption, this film has it all. Every piece of clothing and set, every camera angle and lighting propelled the story relentlessly. I was never bored, and never overwhelmed with overdone violence. Nothing was gratuitous. Viggo Mortensen proved he's one of the finest actors to come along in a long while. Maria Bello carries so much on her talented shoulders. With Mortensen she shines with alternately warming and heartbreaking truthfulness. Ed Harris was delightfully menacing, and William Hurt gave the liveliest and best performance I've seen from him.",2005
10,"I read through a lot of these comments, and it seems quite a few people who have given this film a bad rating based their judgment on either the sex scenes, or the gore (or both). Well, it's called ""A History of Violence"", and it's directed by David Cronenberg! What did they expect? The film is, simply put, amazing. Anyone who enjoys Cronenberg's other films will greatly appreciate this one. It speaks on many levels, and I suggest seeing it more than once to fully take it all in. Beautiful performances all around. I felt as though that is how people put in a situation like that would really act. I had a smile on my face the entire film because I have been waiting all summer (or longer) for a film of this caliber, and it was worth it.",2005
10,"This is, like all Cronenberg's work, a mythic movie. It occupies the world of ""monsters"" that Tom Stall's daughter dreams about at the start. It's as if we get to see the little girl's nightmare as the film unfolds. It's because of this poetic, super-real quality that criticisms from the ""this isn't real life"" brigade have no relevance. The screenplay is exceptionally tight and well-woven - no image is wasted. The subplot of the son's troubles with a school bully parallels the main plot. The very existence of the son is there to show the inheritance - the history - of violence. The sex scenes are there to show the proximity of lust and violence. The end can be nothing other than what it is: as someone else on IMDb has commented, the genie is out of the bottle. This is true for the family in the film, the society we see surrounding the family, and it's true for our families and our society. It's about the inexhaustible rage of humans. It couldn't be more relevant, it couldn't be more timeless. It is well acted and beautifully photographed. I have some minor reservations - did we really need so much of Howard Shore's music? - but on the whole I think this is a superb film. Not for the kiddies, however.",2005
10,"I saw the film at the Cannes Film Festival. All I have to say is: Wow. One of the best thrillers ever. It's refreshing to watch a film in genre that's so often full of clichés. Besides being a thriller, it also a smart film about the culture of violence. How it dominates our world. One of the questions the film asks whether one can live free of violence, even the slightest. In the film violence lurks in every corner and the characters are forced to defend themselves. Definitely my favorite Cronenberg film, also his most mainstream I might add. It's a modern Western and reminds one of those great Western films. As the title indicates it's a very violent film but guess it will be toned down as usual, specially the sex scene. All the stars are in peek form and perfectly cast. William Hurt makes a comeback to better roles. He was also great in ""The King"". It will and should get some awards at the end of the year from critics and etc.",2005

Based on a graphic novel by John Wagner and Vince Locke, Josh Olson's screenplay offers a provocative answer.

10,"Yes, it made me think that if Jean Arthur Rimbaud had been a man of our times he could have been the one behind this film. Optimism through pessimism. The light of darkness. A contradiction that makes sense, that rings true. A mesmerizing film with a spectacular Viggo Mortensen. The truth is there for us to see it, the truth is going to be told but the truth has the flavor of a fantasy. It is the adopted life the invented one that is real. We're invited into this simple but startling reality guided by the masterful hand of David Cronenberg. The casting is a stroke of genius. Viggo Mortensen has the presence of an icon and yet he can disappear be invisible in the most magnetic way. Maria Bello, for me, a stunning surprise. I didn't know (I still don't) her work, I only remembered her name because she has an unforgettable name. But here she proves she's an actress of enormous emotional/dramatic resources. 2005 is not quite over yet but I bet ""A History of Violence"" will be among the two or three best films I've seen all year",2005
10,"I saw this film at a special screening in NYC on Tuesday. It is superb both in direction and acting. Both the sex and violent scenes are quick and direct. While the violence is quite graphic, as to be expected with Cronenberg, the camera does not linger on it at all. The real story is told through the emotional dynamics in the family as the plot unfolds. Mortensen's performance as Tom Stall is brilliant and wonderfully nuanced and the entire cast is first rate. Maria Bello as the wife and Ashton Holmes as the son and Ed Harris as the ""heavy"" are spot on. William Hurt's scene is a standout. There are moments in the film where you laugh and then are horrified within seconds. DC doesn't dumb down to the audience but enjoys the complexities of human reactions to issues of identity, violence and society's view of ""good"" versus ""bad"" violence. I still can't get this film out of my mind. I'm definitely planning on seeing it again when it opens widely. Highly recommended.",2005
10,"Leaving this film (just an hour ago now) I heard a phrase rolling over  and over again in my head: ""Wow.  Wow"". I cannot find adequate words  to relate. I found myself saying ""Why?...Oh my god!...How?...Wow..."".  The film touches, it festers, crawls all over and inside you. The film  does (I think) what Cronenberg intended it to do; frighten. I'm  speaking of real fear that is not spoken out loud, not discussed or  screamed about,or even fully understood. The best and only word I have  to describe the film is that it is ""unsettling"".  I won't discuss the points relating to the sexuality of the film but  will quickly address the violence. I read Cronenberg's answers to some  questions raised by the film, most relating to the violence itself. He  mentions that it is ""intimate, nasty, brutish and quick"" also going on  at length on the utilitarian nature of the violent acts in the film.  This is perhaps the first film I've seen to display violence in, what I  consider to be, a true sense. It is over so quickly and before one can  marvel at it, the guilt and terror washes over like waves in a storm.  It's relatively refreshing, albeit downright sickening, to see a film  that can still shock the hell out of what is thought to be a  desensitized generation.  That being said, one must remember that an author, poet, director etc.  NEVER has the final say on what a book, poem or film's meaning is or  what its symbols or set pieces are about. Each person in turn must have  his or her take on the medium. I'd like to close with my final and  wholly overriding thought concerning ""A History of Violence"": It is a  film which I desperately wish to see again but equally compelling is  the urge to never, ever see it again. Never have such strong yet  equally conflicting views about something so trivial as a film entered  my psyche.  The rating of 10 is based on my personal experience with the film, not  necessarily the merit of the film itself.  You may interpret that as you will.",2005
8,"David Cronenberg's films seem to be obsessed with the co-existence of the extremes, of bad and evil - in the same body as in 'The Fly', on the same highway as in 'Crash', in the same game as in 'eXistenZ'. In his latest film he seems to be saying - evil is here among us, it is dormant in any of us, it can be awaken and maybe put to sleep again, but at a price.",2006
1,"i didn't realise this was a Cronenberg movie until after it had finished. in fact, i didn't know much about the movie at all, but after some good recommendations from friends i was quite looking forward to it. rest assured, from now on, i will never listen to another word those friends say regarding movies! the only way i can describe this picture without swearing is a mess... in fact, it was so bad it encouraged me to sign up to IMDb so i could express just how painful an experience watching 'a history of violence' was!",2005
5,"I had high hopes for _A History of Violence_, since there were rave reviews and I love Cronenberg's earlier films, like _The Fly_ and _Naked Lunch_, but I cannot even begin to guess why everyone is raving about this one. It has none of the creative strangeness of his earlier films. Although the acting is decent, the lines are clunky, and there are big plausibility issues--and little ones, like a TV reporter who is completely foiled by ""I don't want to talk about it"" and a sheriff who says things like ""We're good people around here."" But maybe most importantly, the movie just proceeds dutifully from one scene to the next, where people say and do things that are completely obvious, that reveal no emotional depth, and that really have no purpose. Anyone who has seen the TV ads knows that Tom was probably once a ruthless killer and, yep, sure enough, he was. The revelation could hardly be less shocking, and the plot and characters develop in no interesting directions after that.",2005
5,"Are you in the mood for a fast-paced, action-packed thriller? Well, so was I. Unfortunately, you won't find it here. However, if you were extremely interested in A History of Violence after watching the trailer and you're in the mood to be disappointed, then by all means, knock yourself out with this one! I simply don't understand why everybody is praising this one to the high heavens. I was looking forward to it, and I hate to say that it's simply the biggest disappointment of the year. It starts off on a promising note when Viggo takes care of the bad guys who enter his diner. For a few brief moments it looks like it's trying to be a well-crafted mystery/thriller. But once it starts inducing unintentional laughter thanks to scenes that look like they came out of a bad after school special or a soft core made-for-late-night-Cinemax film we realize that this is just a complete mess.",2005
1,"For the life of me I can't understand what people see in this film. I saw it at the Toronto Film Festival. The movie is plagued with bad acting, bad dialogue, miscasting, and a cliché plot. I've read comments that the movie is introspective. But I failed to see an introspective moment on screen.",2005
1,I cannot believe that people who have actually gone to watch this movie and are leaving positive reviews are actually leading their lives without the aid of a white stick and Labrador! It is easily one of the worst films I have ever seen and an example of actors taking an easy pay cheque.,2005
9,"More than the average bunch of journalists showed up at the Hamburg press screening of David Cronenbergs suggestively titled ""A History of Violence"", eager to see the R-rated film that had caused quite a bit of discussion (and uncomfortable laughter at the exaggeratedly graphic scenes of violence) in Cannes. It turned out to be a very refreshing experience indeed. Although this is easily Cronenbergs most accessible film, one that may disappoint old fans but will certainly win him lots of mainstream viewers, it's still a long shot from the cliché-ridden thrillers one usually gets to review. A clever, manipulative take at the title-giving topic, oscillating between relaxed mid-western realism and the extreme, almost comic brutality one has got used to in the wake of Lynch, Woo and Tarantino. ",2005
10,"David Cronenberg is a very accomplished director - what with ""The Fly"" (1986), ""Naked Lunch"", ""Scanners"", and of coarse ""Dead Ringers"" he has done a marvelous job directing numerous pictures with different subjects and genres. However all his films carry on thing through and that is emotional impact of events on the individuals depicted. ""A History"" once again follows through with that in images and feelings almost on par with ""Dead Ringers"". This is a study of violence, through an incident and how it's effects play on those affiliated with the committer. Viggo Mortenson turns in a tour-de-force performance as Tom Stall, without his acting abilities the film would fall under the weight of it's subject matter. The script is a wide, breathing, and alive, it conveys and allows every emotion to weave through it, without detouring from the main theme. Cronenberg's directing is as excellent as ever, and though some may argue this is his most ""main-stream"" film his style and presence is felt throughout. From the beginning lingering shot of the hotel room, you will be hooked and entranced throughout. The only negative thing available to be said would be that the son's (Ashton Holme's) acting is very stilted throughout and when he is set to deliver an emotional outcry, he falls slightly below expectation, especially amongst such well equipped and experienced actors as Maria Bello (Edie Stall). Howard Shore's score is very subdued, but it should be, and it elevates the ever encompassing dread and tension that is on full display through the film (aside from the beginning). All in all, I just must say great film.",2005
5,"1. The beginning. It was very slow in the beginning and the scene in the office was predictable and it was annoying to have to wait for that. If the movie was making fun of movies that do that, well, ha ha. 2. The whole cheerleader fantasy sex thing. He knew she was going to pick him up after work, but he acted like it was a big surprise when he came out. And what was the deal with the big build up like she was going to have a donkey show or something and then she's just wearing a cheerleader costume? 3.The two people fighting and then getting hot and having sex? That is not real life. When you fight, you hate the other person and find them repulsive, especially if you are married to them. 4.The kid has a bad dream and dad comes in the room first, then the brother and then the mother last? The best case scenario would be the husband groggily nudging mom to wake her up. 5.The husband trying to outrun the car to protect his wife? If he could call his wife, why not call the police too? No more minutes? She could have called as well, since they are so first-name-basis. 6.The truck is barely working, but it gets him all the way to Philly? ",2005
1,"It was to put it bluntly, shocking. The acting was bad, the story was awful- there was no conclusion whatsoever. It wasn't gritty and real, it wasn't fantaisical or interesting it just-was. And what it was, I don't even care to remember. I was so grossly disappointed as the trailer appeared quite different but I was grossly disappointed to find yet another appalling Viggo Mortensen film, and yet another shocking gangster-eqsue film-that-tries-to-be-something-it's-not (ie Revolver). For anyone who tells me I'm shallow for not seeing some deeply hidden, and meaningful aspect to History of Violence- I have to ask, what on earth this hidden meaning would be, and why it has to be quite so hidden, as if it wasn't for every single second of it being dreadful, the film had the potential to be really good.",2005
1,"A History of Violence obviously greatly appealed on some strange level to most critics across the country. It did not, however appeal to me or any of the other twenty something people in the theater when I saw it. The story begins with two obviously insane killers murdering a child in a gas station. Then we are taken to a small town where a local diner owner turns out to have once been affiliated with the mafia I guess. Well the two killers attack him and then he kills them. Then the mafia finds out he's there and they come after him. Well he kills all of them too then he goes back to his original home and kills the rest of the mafia people who are after him. The plot is not too original, kind of reminded me of my blue heaven with Steve Martin. But what had me booing the film out loud in the theater was the acting. The acting and the script were terrible. And honestly I like Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen. I liked Pollock and I liked Lalene in Carlitos Way. Somehow this movie was embraced by the film elite a group of people who praise boring, crappy movies for god knows what reason. The worst is in the end when he is confronted by the boss who keeps saying Joey over and over again in a horrible fake tough guy accent. Who ever that was I believe he was nominated for an academy award for his five minute contribution to the movie. The only good part is when the son of ""Joey"" beats the crap out of a school bully who has been bothering him. What is wrong with Hollywood today. I do not know. But this film was possibly one of the worst I have ever seen. In fact my friend and I hated it so much we almost walked out but since we lived in NYC at the time we had just paid nearly thirteen dollars for tickets. Pauly Shore movies contain better acting.",2007
8,"I was astonished at the dismal rating for this film, which at the time of this writing was 4.8. Into the Blue never demonstrated any pretense of becoming the next academy award winner, and instead faithfully executed its focus -- beautiful ocean scenery, beautiful bodies, and a significant degree of tension and action to carry the plot. I found the characters believable, especially given the target audience of the movie: the dialog was fairly cleverly humorous, but serious when it needed to be; the characters were adequately conceived, including the intentionally unlikeable 4th party woman who ""wasn't family."" Most of all, I enjoyed the pacing of the movie. Some slow underwater scenes were accompanied by peaceful music belying the increasingly perilous situations the characters found themselves in. Halfway through the movie, the tension never fully dissipates, as each event flows into the next as the stakes rise. The badguys are dealt with intelligently, and there are enough twists to convincingly carry the instability and danger of the situation.",2005
5,"You almost feel like Rodney Dangerfield from Back to School after watching this movie. The film has some neat underwater photography, some good stunts, and even a twist or two. But ultimately, it's just as excuse to show off some young flesh. Is that entirely a bad thing? The Hound thinks not. A good dosage of Jessica Alba flesh can warm you up on the coldest winter day.",2006

8,"I'm pretty critical of most pop films, but I thought this was one of the best ones to come out in awhile. The underwater cinematography was amazing - totally worth the matinée price and cheaper than diving- the kind of film you need the bigscreen to enjoy. ",2005
6,"Which is: popcorn. This PG-13 ""kiddie-action"" gets a solid 6/10 from me. I did have my expectations low but that has nothing to do with the fact that this movie is as solid and tight as Jessica Alba in bikinis! There were more than just a few moments where there was either a twist I didn't see coming or an intense moment that left me thinking ""OK, wasn't this supposed to be a PG-13 movie?"" On top of those, the overall - checklist looks green: dialog, characters, tempo, photography, editing... All in all, a cut above the rest in its own genre and a ""risk-free"" choice to rent. Shame it did only 18 million at the box-office because it's as good as ""The Fast and the Furious""!",2005
6,"This is a suspenseful and engrossing movie with agreeable performances and good rendering of underwater action. It concerns about an innocent couple(Paul Waker, Jessica Alba) get involved in an underwater search for treasures in the island Bahamas. They descend deep into the big blue without the aid of any kind of breathing apparatus, though sometimes use scubas. The frogmen get excited when they accidentally discover what they believe is a vast sunken treasure. They along with a friends(Scott Cahan, Ashley Scott) find a shipwrecked galleon and a crashed plane plenty of dope . In the process they are threatened and then must to thwart the enemies. The team of divers faces danger when they attempt to retrieve goods from a pirate ship, as they spend time in shark-infested water and compete with treasure-seeker(Josh Brolin) and confront against nasty drug-lord(James Frain). The four divers set off on a perilous expedition in search of legendary treasure of pirate, resting in ocean floor and take back drug into the plane.",2008
8,"I didn't have high hopes when I went to see this film and expected it to be little more than Jessica Alba in a bikini and her friends arguing over some underwater goodies. How wrong I was ! Ms Alba is the only 'big' name in this film but all the actors do an excellent job in building-up and developing their characters. The dialogue and interaction is very good, how the characters relate to each other and how they behave is completely believable and its a really good story. Its starts off slow, setting the scene and introducing characters gradually and then it suddenly begins to accelerate - soon enough there are British gangsters appearing, a bit of piracy going-on, some mystery over a sunken ship and several plot twists. Yes Miss Alba is scantily clad but this is a good thriller with a good story that keeps adding surprises along the way.",2005
5,INTO THE BLUE is beautifully photographed and most of the underwater scenes are astounding. Jared(Paul Walker)and Sam(Jessica Alba)are joined by old friend Bryce(Scott Caan)and his new squeeze Amanda(Ashley Scott)as they dive into the shark-infested waters of the Bahamas. Jared and Bryce have dreamed of discovering sunken treasure since they were boys. The foursome discovers a legendary pirate ship rumored to have gone to the bottom with millions in gold. The divers also find a sunken plane containing a cargo of cocaine worth a king's ransom that puts themselves in dutch with the drug lord wanting his illicit property.,2006

10,"I don't go to movies much but I am an avid diver and wanted to watch this on the big screen. There are really only about 5 movies that made the big screen and involve diving to any degree. I have over 300 dives and I have never seen a more beautiful capture of the love of water. From the Jet Ski scene to the Yachts to the fantastic display of coral fish and rays galore I felt like I was right there. It seems the movie is being ripped up because of the drug involvement and treasure find similar to the Deep. Are you for real? Take any murder mystery and of which there are thousands, and guess what there's a stiff a cop and someone with a weapon who seems like a nice guy but isn't. And that's OK cause as long as there's blood a babe and a bad cop the tickets will keep selling. As long as you see this movie for what it is you will enjoy it very much. This is about a guy with high morals -a little lacking today, who is living in trash to do what he wants more then anything in the world, a treasure finder. Trouble finds him because he is good at what he does. The movie is fast paced and exciting from the very beginning I can't believe the poor reviews that have been listed by other viewers. This is worth every bit of $7 to see.",2005
8,"After reading some negative feedbacks regarding Into the Blue, I was a little bit pessimistic about that movie that's why I went to see it without expecting anything from it(...except maybe to contemplate Jessica Alba :). From the very beginning, the paradisiac place where the story takes place in with a suitable music grab you from your boring every day life...into the blue. After 5 minutes, you're already dreaming of being Jared (Paul Walker) (people here have no surname ;) having Sam (Jessica Alba:) just for you but everything gets complicated when old Jared's pal Bryce arrives on the Island with is 14 hours girl friend Amanda. As a bad boy, the new guy involves Jared in doing nuts illegal stuff with drugs discovered before in a crashed airplane. As a consequence. Jared and Sam who were hoping for a quiet happy life sink in illegality in spite of themselves and paradise becomes hell! Add to this some tiger sharks, lost treasures, pirates, drug dealers, treasons and you get Into the blue, the kind of movie you'll be happy to watch, a cold Winter Saturday night with noisy pals with some pizzas and fresh beers. I give it an 8 because it really lets me escape from reality. In a nutshell, if you're afraid to buy it, rent it!",2006
9,"If you like crystal clear underwater scenery, life at a sunny shore and boating there is no way for you to miss this film. I watched it twice on a razor sharp big scope-screen to take in all the underwater details. The film takes every opportunity to put the likable characters under water, and this is what the film is all about. The beauty of the people in this simple adventure plot adds to the overall beauty of this film and is not a separate element as a lot of Jessica-Alba-in-bikini-blah-blah suggests. Let it put a smile on your face but let it not pop your eyes out. Along with that, pop songs, film music and sound effects are organically interwoven. The film consists of scenes and NOT of cheap fast cuts and hectic camera work, below and above surface. ",2005

Friend Scott Caan shows up with latest girlfriend Ashley Scott, and when the four go diving they find buried treasure. Not only do they find a recent plane crash filled with drugs, but also a long lost pirate ship rumored to contain gold. ""Into The Blue"" is wonderfully shot, with beautiful scenery of the water and diving, and it's barely dressed actors. The film drifts around for it's first hour or so without too much going on. Most of the movie at first consists of the two couples arguing over what to do with the lost treasure. Caan and Scott, playing the selfish couple want to take the drugs immediately, while the more responsible couple(Walker and Alba) want to go about things the right way by filing a claim. Then the film really picks up at the end leading to a very exciting, and surprisingly violent final half hour.",2005

7,"I don't know what everyone out there is expecting from this movie? I was expecting a movie targeted at teenagers and generation x, with a lot of skin and fast boats. While it definitely had a few close ups of Jessica and Paul underwater and some professional waverunner stunts, it was also a pretty good story with a ""leave you hanging"" ending. In fact, the storyline was much more dominant than the skin and fast boats. Although billed as the lead of the movie and clearly the largest star, Jessica Alba (and her character) played a backseat role to Paul Walker whose ethical and moral dilemmas were the heart of the movie. Maybe it's the same theme in many movies? Young bright people with everything going for them are introduced to bad influences and they are tempted by these outside forces. They make a few bad decisions, learn from them, and then make the right decision. Or do they? Into the Blue follows the same premise, but at least this premise dominates the movie, not selling out for the teenage box office. At least not overtly. This movie isn't going to win an Oscar, but it was definitely worth $10.",2005

The movie isn't very good, but features some of the most beautiful underwater scenes ever caught on video-camera. The actors in this movie is not very good. except from Jessica Alba and Paul Walker who is good enough. The only good thing in this movie is to see the most beautiful woman in the world Jessica Alba in a swimming-suit. Jessica Alba was the only reason in wanted to see this movie.

10,"Into The Blue (Stockwell, USA, 2005) is set to be the most criminally under-rated masterpiece of (post)modern times. Its place in international critical canons ought to be a simple arbitrary fact. This might seem hyperbolic to some. Let me assure you, it is not. The qualities of this film know no bounds. I shall sing its praises until I find myself staring at the ceiling of some hospital ward, malingering on my deathbed. All scholarly criticism aside, this picture is a no less than 10,000 leagues ahead of all other underwater drug-smuggling Cameltoe-Festaculars that have ever gone before it, and I daresay, of all that will succeed it. I cannot begin to convey via this most primitive form of expression - word-processing - how supremely; how all-encompassing; how serotonin-inducing, director John Stockwell has improved the basic quality of my life. In a single motion picture, spanning just two hours, he has brought to mankind what can only be described as an unbridled cacophony of excellence. Listen not to the critics of your local newspaper. Listen not to Jonathan Ross on Film 2005 just before you brush you teeth and go to bed. Listen to the little man, or woman, inside your head who sees in Jessica Alba something that is lacking from your otherwise mundane life. Listen to the self you buried years ago, along with your childhood dreams. Listen to me. Go see this film. Pure cinema rarely sees the light of day in the nocturnal world of Hollywood cinema. By nocturnal, I mean dark. And by dark I don't mean smouldering films with edge and deeper meaning. I mean films that don't deserve to see the light of day. The kind of Hollywood films that saturate our daily lives. Be they advertised on the sides of double-decker buses or on our packs of Crunchy Nut Cornflakes, offering some cheap plastic tie-in.

You'll only be disappointed if you expect to be entertained. I was bored by god I was bored! Jessica Alba plays Sam, a shark-loving scuba diver who spends her sun-filled days swimming in the glistening Caribbean Sea with her equally-tanned-and-toned boyfriend Jared (Paul Walker). While looking for buried treasure, they come across a sunken airplane filled with cocaineand wackiness ensues. Yes, there are hot people to look at, but looks will only take you so far, and an hour ""Into the Blue"" and you're going to start wishing for an interesting and captivating story line.

10,"Atop a hillside in Liberia overlooking an impending village massacre once the arms deal settles, Nicolas Cage's Yuri pleads to his conscience rattled brother Vitaly (Jared Leto), ""It is none of our business!"" Writer and Director Andrew Niccol's ""Lord of War"" is all about the big business of war, and the cost of selling one's soul. That lost soul is Yuri Orlov played masterfully by Nicolas Cage. Cage as Yuri also narrates the story. Niccol sets the warped and dark tone in the opening sequence of the manufacture of a bullet to its final destinationso to speak. Yuri comments that there is one firearm for every 12 people in the world. So the question is ""How do we arm the other eleven?"" Niccol's ""Lord of War"" is not so much a clever indictment of humanity, rather an acknowledgment of perhaps humanity's darker nature. In a poignant and chilling realization for Yuri (Cage) he says, ""They say that 'evil prevails when good men fail to act.' It should be 'evil prevails'."" I don't think this is cynicism on Niccol's part, rather only stating what is so given all of history and now. He certainly makes us think from the inside out.",2005
8,"Gulp. What stays with you long after seeing this movie, is the ""based on actual events"" caveat. Even if this has been Hollywoodized to the max, the core story  that of Yuri Orlov, Ukrainian immigrant boy who learns running guns is easy money and that he has a real knack for it, then grows up to be a conscience-free worldwide leader in arms dealing, etc.  is bone-chilling because grains of truth exist.",2005
10,"A movie about a gunrunner who arms the dictators, tyrants, and genocide-perpetrators of the world should not be this deliciously funny. Lord of War is story-telling perfection. The opening scene depicts the life of a bullet, from its creation in the factory to the moment it blasts through the head of a poor African child. Nicolas Cage is Yuri Orlov, the son of Ukrainian immigrants, who becomes the world's most successful arms dealer. Writer/director Andrew Niccol took every major world conflict of the part 25 years and seamlessly incorporated them into a smart, funny, complex story about violence, corruption, and the essence of warfare. Lord of War has no clear-cut, black-or-white, good-or-evil ""moral of the story,"" but no intelligent observation ever does. It's just a fabulous film. ""I never sold to Osama Bin Laden,"" Yuri tells the audience. ""Not on moral grounds, but because his checks were always bouncing back then.""",2005

It's not until an Interpol agent (Ethan Hawke) is hot on Yuri's case that he begins to question the nature of his business and whether what he is doing for a living is moral and if he should be responsible for the hands these weapons get into and what they are used for. A powerful performance by Nicolas Cage, as well as a great thought-provoking movie ensues I love movies like this one for a few reasons. The main reason is that for the most part you can't predict what is going to happen next or where the film is going. Another reason I like movies like this is because it's powerful and its makes you think. And lastly I like a movie like this because it doesn't end in a typical way and actually leaves you feeling blown-away and surprised.",2005

Nicholas Cage's role of a ""gunrunner"" sheds light to subjects otherwise not focused on by todays society. Too often do films dull down the truth of life. The term ""speechless"" comes to me when i think of what one word to describe this film. Cage does a wonderful job of keeping his guard up and showing how strong and selfless one must be to do what no one else will.

7,"I have been running ""Lord of War"" through my head; cinematically, it promises to be a more interesting film than it ends up being. The first shot of the path of the bullet from start to bloody finish promises a stark look at the gun-running industry, and to a degree, there is some truth to it. However, I also wonder how much of the film is Hollywoodized. I kept on thinking that it felt like a Hollywood story of corrupt power like that of Tony Montana or Johnny Depp in ""Blow.""",2005
7,"If this movie was three hours long and had a few more secondary characters it would have been the greatest movie of the decade. The story is a capturing tragedy, there are some brilliant ideas (the opening scene, the father pretending to be Jewish, the one night disappearing of the cargo, the lined up tanks shoot, Orlov's being a patron of the arts, the gasp after the encounter with the two prostitutes), the director had already showed his skills in setting up detailed and visually perfect representations (Gattaca), actors fit, lines are sharp, there's humor, but the whole thing looks like Niccol was in a hurry. And, maybe, a little too naive. Since when millionaire illegal arm dealers cruise all over the world without twenty fierce bodyguards? And, correct me if I'm wrong, Interpol has so many men, equipments and dollars at its disposal? Anyway, does it actually exist? And do lovely parents like those arrive at their son's marriage party after all the others? Weren't they at church? And what a coincidence having an uncle who is a colonel in the soviet army! And can a white guy in a suit survive more than five minutes alone in an African slum at night? And that blonde child! Didn't really Yuri suspect at all about his wife's loyalty? Too many shortcuts, imprecisions and anachronisms (for God's sake, couldn't they provide appropriate clothes for the seventies at least?). It's no big deal, all right, but they are distractions, they are the same of grammar mistakes in a book: they break your imagination and make you say -Hey, it's not real, I'm only watching a movie!- And that's the most anti movie thing that you can find in a movie. Worse if the movie is good.",2007
3,"Lord of War, for all its radical and anti-establishment trappings, is about as comforting and safe a movie as you could possibly imagine. Its banal, elementary messages can be summed up as: Guns are bad. People who trade in them are bad. Many parts of Africa are messed-up. Nicolas Cage is wearing a hair piece. In an ever-decreasing circle of asinine clichés that would insult the intelligence of a seven-year-old child, Lord of War takes us into the terrible and frightening world of international gun-running. Cage plays an international gun-runner with weird hair and an indeterminate accent. He will sell to anyone, anywhere, as long as they cough up the cash. And what a lot of cash that turns out to be. He lives the high-life. He has everything: a loser little brother, a gorgeous but frustrated wife, stereotype parents, persistent FBI guy on his trail, the works. Keen-eyed viewers may well spot parallels between this film and Goodfellas. And Blow. And no doubt one or two other movies. In other words, we've seen it all before, and done a lot better. Andrew Niccol, the hack who gave Gattaca and Simone to a grateful public, may think he's dealing with heavy moral issues and opening our eyes to the way the world really is. In fact, all he's doing is dressing up a predictable ""rise-and-fall"" story with a bit of student politics. But no amount of moralising and politicising can disguise the total obviousness and predictability of the whole enterprise. At one point, Cage's wife, an aspiring but not over-talented painter sells her first painting. Guess who bought it? Then, Cage's brother, a drug-addled loser, gets clean, gets a girl-friend and states that his life is getting better all the time. Guess what happens to him? Later, Cage's uncle tells him how great everything is and then walks off to get into his car. Guess what happens then? And so on. Instead of being surprised by the movie, the audience is always at least one, if not fifteen steps ahead of it. The cast includes Ian Holm, Ethan Hawke, Eamonn Walker and Jared Leto (we name the guilty men!). These are all talented and intelligent performers, which only makes you wonder what on earth they are doing involved in this mess. As for Bridget Moynahan, let's just say she is well cast as a model who wants to get into acting but doesn't have the talent.",2006

7,"This portrait of a big time arms dealer of Ukrainian origin, Yuri Orlov, starring Nicolas Cage (whose performance holds your attention throughout), has many schlocky Hollylwood elements, such as Yuri's druggie brother Vitaly (Jared Leto) and his trophy wife (Bridget Moynahan), his numerous sexy conquests along the way to megawealth, his ""friendship"" with the dramatic president of Liberia (Eamonn Walker), and the ridiculously relentless and steely Interpol agent who pursues him (Ethan Hawke). All these are colorful exhibits rather then people. The slickness of the decor and cinematography impress pointlessly. Cage's narration is full of tendentious declarations, like ""The problem with dating dream girls is that they have a tendency to become real."" Or ""I would tell you to go to hell, but I think you're already there."" Some of the zingers fall flat or are just obvious, like ""I sell to leftists, and I sell to rightists. I even sell to pacifists, but they're not the most regular customers,"" or ""There are two types of tragedies in life. One is not getting what you want, the other is getting it. "" There is more than enough of that, and you have to be pretty easily impressed to like it. The movie also sometimes revels in the evils it depicts. But it includes some significant home truths about world politics like the fact that the world's biggest arms dealers are the US, UK, France, Russia, and China, and they are also the permanent members of the UN Security Council. Some of the cynicism in this movie is pretty strong stuff. It certainly doesn't lull you.",2006
7,"A very enjoyable way to pass a couple of hours although over the space of twenty screen years nobody seems to age. The cinematography is fantastic,especially in Africa(some great open landscapes). The most jarring thing for me was a couple of (you can see them coming from a mile away)VERY obvious deaths. The first five minutes are superb, a mini-movie that could be called 'The life of a Bullet'. The soundtrack is also superior to your usual Hollywood movie. Strangely Nicholas Cage should be the 'Bad Guy' but isn't portrayed as such.By the same token Ethan Hawke is a fairly unsympathetic 'good guy'. And are they really his teeth?",2006

Whatever happened to characters, stories and dialog? The big studios wonder why box office numbers keep declining, well its because of crap like this.",2006

1,There are some films that disturb with their truth. Then there are movies that are trying to tell too much truth that they miss the mark. Lord of War is one of those movies.,2006
1,"Why does this movie fail? Here's why: because it's ultimately superficial and you can't connect with the characters at all. Lord of War is about a Ukrainian man(Nicolas Cage) living in the US, who decides to become a gun smuggler after witnessing a heist and he also tries to win the love of his live, who is a talentless actress, in the process(I'm not making this up, honest). He starts small time(don't ask me how) with second hand guns and also invites his drug-addicted «brother» along, but being a gun smuggler doesn't sound easy. The movie chronicles his rise to becoming a gun smuggler and several encounters with buyers and occasionally trying to outmaneuver an Interpol agent in some of the most bizarre sequences I've ever seen. All through the movie, Nicolas Cage provides the voice over to the whole movie and I seriously wished he didn't. Obviously it's about gun smuggling and the movie tries to draw well-though(not really) ironies about this particular market and, as it's becoming more and more common, the role of the US in all of this(the United States of America as the root of all the problems in the world,of course, what do you expect?). It reminds me of Crash for the very same aspect: like racism, it thinks it's saying something new and revealing some overwhelming truth about gun smuggling. The movie pretends to be deep but it's message is nothing more complex then: Guns are bad; only innocent people get shot or are affected by the market(we all know this is true***sarcasm***);both legal gun sellers and black market dealers are evil(though the movie never explains this); owning guns automatically turns you into a crazy murderer(who needs facts? The scriptwriters think it's enough to show a struggling African country to make their point) ; if we didn't have any guns, people wouldn't kill each other(yes, true and deep); oh, and the US uses a corrupt court to fix the elections(I seriously laughed my butt off when they mentioned this in the movie) and is entirely responsible for everything mentioned above. Let's start with the characters, Nicolas Cage plays a Ukrainian gun smuggler who looks nothing like an Ukrainian, doesn't act like one and doesn't talk like one, not to mention he was a lifeless character, and his rants and monologue just drag the film and bores you to death. Jared Leto does no better and both act as if they're acquaintances rather then brothers or at least not any brothers I know of. The actress who plays Yuri's wife just stalls and the biggest offender is Ethan Hawke, the Interpol agent who has a «deep» sense of morality and wants to stop Yuri(Cage) at all cost, too bad he's barely a character, and his sense of morality is about as deep as a puddle of water,especially in moments where he could have given a lesson of morality to Yuri, he spills out something that seems more appropriate to cheesy action movies then a though-provoking thriller like this. In short you will feel no sympathy for any of the characters nor will you connect with them. If you already hate guns and will buy anything to support the cause,you'll like it, everybody else won't be convinced. One last thing:having the words ""based on true events"" in a fictional movie means absolutely nothing...",2006
2,"This is a seemingly committed movie that, at first glance, has good intentions and pretends to say a lot; however, in the end, it is a flat and profoundly dishonest crowd-pleaser for action-movie goers, who might like guns, this (alas!) necessary evil, but who also have a nice bleeding heartfor arms dealers. ",2005
8,"Let me start off by saying that I was introduced to the films of Terrence Malick in 1998 when I watched and was blown away by 'The Thin Red Line.' It is one of the best war movies ever made and while I can rant about it at length, that review belongs on a different page. It was with great anticipation that I waited for 'The New World.' I was lucky enough to get tickets to an advance screening and the theatre was full of people like me. Their take on the film was almost as interesting as the film was.",2006
10,This film was everything I had hoped for and infinite volumes more. Writer/Director Terrence Malik simply refuses to see film-making as anything short of an art form and handles his brushes (not to mention every frame) with the tender care and command of an artistic master.,2006
10,"First, let me applaud this film. I have been waiting for Terrence Malick's fourth film ever since I saw The Thin Red Line. Arguably, Malick is one of the most adept and deliberate filmmakers right now. The New World is nearly flawless, and the beauty of Malick's direction adds to the argument that film can still be considered aesthetic. Much has been lost in the last 30 years, but Terrence Malick sticks to what he knows. What some people may complain about this movie are the long silences, the action-less movement, and the poetic voice over. This is what Malick does. He is a modern transcendentalist. What he does with film is comparable to what Emerson did in writing. The color is naturalistic, and the sounds are earthly. It helps that Malick uses natural light for his shots, giving the scenery more life and texture. As for the substance of the film, what isn't pantomimed in subtle gestures and movements is brought to life with flowing poetic voice over. This goes all the way back to Badlands for Malick. But here, we get varying minds contributing. There are some moments in this film when the viewer has to understand the characters by their facial expressions instead of their words. I think that will be hard for a lot of people who are expecting a more vocative and kinetic film. As for the acting, I was very impressed with all involved, particularly Q'Orianka Kilcher. This young woman played the part of innocence beautifully. I also have to give some credit to Colin Farrell, considering I never expect much out of him. Unlike some of his other movies, he was not in it to steal the spotlight. Everyone played their parts without any excessive over-acting. This movie is a historical drama, but I feel like the history aspect is merely a backdrop for the Terrence Malick play. In his production, the flowing waters and the forest canopy are the actors, and the gentle reflections of troubled minds are the words. Truly, this is an incredible film. I have waited a long time for Terrence Malick to wow me again, and he has done exactly that. If you want a movie that tears at your heart strings, then go see something recycled like Brokeback Mountain. If you want a transcendental experience, one that challenges you to go deeper than the surface of the film, then The New World is waiting.",2006
10,"I finally saw ""The New World"" yesterday. It was quite an experience.This film is miles away from any other that I've ever seen before. It's a feast for the senses. Senses are the key to this movie. You either let them guide you or you've missed the whole point. I cannot blame anyone who has complained about how slow, boring or even irritating this picture was. This is not the kind of movie that can be appreciated by intelligent reading. Neither does it belong to the category of highbrow artistic films that aim to an intellectual elite of an audience and shut out the rest of us, poor lesser mortals. You don't have to ""understand"" this film, you have to ""feel"" it. Just open up your heart and let the emotions carry you away and elevate you. The plot is simple and far from original. Adam and Eve, paradise lost, human greed and personal ambition coming face to face with the beauty of nature and the joy of pure living. Clash between illusion and reality, dream and fact. The originality of this film lies in the way that these themes are depicted. Muted glances, forbidden touches, light and darkness mingle with the murmur of the river and the rustle of the wind  the breath of mother nature. Dialogs are scarce. Mainly voice overs run through the whole picture. I found them neither irritating nor useless. They are uttered in the form of inner thoughts, secret longings, muted prayers and they add to the dreamlike effect of this movie. Acting was actually very good. That was an extra bonus for a film like this, where actors are meant more to help the story and the images unfold, than astound us with their memorable performances. The actors' success in this movie lies in their ability to express their feelings through minor gestures, glances and body language. Q'Orianka Kilcher is a magnificent creature that embodies the essence of nature and beauty. She bends, she submits to the inevitability of assimilation but she never loses her freedom of spirit. Farrell's sad eyes speak volumes of emotion that could never be expressed in spoken words and Bale's kind-hearted demeanor is just perfect. ""The New World"" is like a poem. What I got out of it was a bitter-sweet taste in my mouth, a swirl of images and sounds in my mind and a wealth of emotion in my heart",2006
10,"A quite-literally breathtaking 120 minute montage of sights and sounds evoking the first British contact with North America. The narrative is minimal, even inconsequential, as perhaps it should be in a story that is predominantly about the human need to communicate even when language is a barrier rather than a vehicle to understanding. The performances are universally outstanding, the cinematography and editing award worthy, and the use of 'Das Rheingold' the most inspired use of Wagner ever in a movie. 'The New World' is a genuinely poetic, lyrical, visually stunning and heartbreaking movie. About as flawless as cinema gets. For those still unsure of my feelings, I loved this movie.",2006
10,"This was incredible. I'm living at the moment in the awful urban sprawl of Dublin , Ireland and took myself right into the inner city to see this and, to my surprise, found myself being transported not only to another land but also to another time. When I came out, I was in a trance for the rest of the day, pining for a land and society that is no more and dreaming sweet dreams of angelic Pocahontas, gentle John Rolfe and ruggedly genuine John Smith. All three of course excellently played by Q'uiranka (is that right), Christian and even Colin who, though the accent may have been shaky, captured perfectly what it would have been to be in John Smith's situation. Mallick, of course, is a genius and when his films are this good they're well worth the decade or so of waiting. Also, I don't know who the director of photography was but what a job they did, possibly the most beautiful film ever put on screen. All in all, a masterpiece which I'll carry with me every step I take in this ofttimes sorry world.",2006
9,The New World ,2005
1,"Dreadful. That is the best word I can use to describe this film. It starts out slow...and then tapers off. This subject had all the makings of a great story: flight from European oppression, venturing into the Unknown, internal conflicts, struggle for survival, battles with the indigenous peoples, romance. All of these things should lend themselves to an interesting and engaging movie. Instead, we get over two hours of a beautifully filmed, but self-indulgent, preachy, meandering, and ultimately boring work. There is little dialogue, with most of the characters preferring to monologue (almost inaudibly) and/or pray as they wander through the forest. There is even less action, with the few battle scenes and occasional power struggles (between John Smith and those who would usurp his command) having little buildup and being over quickly, which is about the only thing in this tedious movie that does happen quickly. You would expect that a film about the men who first tried to colonize Virginia to be exciting or at the very least interesting, but it's a 135-minute marathon to see whether you can stay awake and resist the urge to fast-forward through the obviously overdone and drawn out scenery shots. Also, you'll spend a lot of time turning up the volume to hear the self-important and pretentious voice-overs, of which there are many.",2006
1,"Quite possibly the most boring ""epic"" ever envisioned; If you like no dialog, lots of trees, swirling random cameras, trees, grass, silence, and trees, this is the movie for you. It's a mind-numbing 2+ hours that you'll never get back. You might actually hate yourself.",2006
3,"This film is a perfect example of a self-indulgent director-writer failing to edit it down to a watchable movie length just so he can get every one of his own visions on celluloid before his film career ends. This is one of the most slow-moving, melodramatic, contrived, over-the-top costume, cinematographic over-kill movies I have ever seen. Thank goodness someone had the sense to cast Christian Bale so that the film at least grabbed your attention for the short time he was on screen. Director Mr. Malik should perhaps take up nature photography instead of wasting studio money and the time that it takes for people to watch it.",2006
1,"Holy yipes! I have seen some boring movies before but this soporific mess is the topper. How does a director graduate from film school having learned only the close up shot? And what excuse can there be for a movie score with only one musical note? Its like listening to the test pattern noise on the TV when you wake up at 4AM on the couch. Even the perpetually grey weather is boring in this film. I haven't checked my watch that much since New Year's Eve. If you need to be rendered comatose for some surgical procedure, then this film is for you. Never have I posted a comment on a movie before. However, in this example it is plain and simply a civic duty since this film risks creating large squads of somnambulistic zombies who might attempt to drive home, wide-eyed but oblivious, from their local theaters. Of course, nature lovers will perhaps be interested in the many long views of trees, grass and water but staring at your wallpaper will be both cheaper and more fun.",2006
1,"The only reason I can understand people would give this such a high rating is because they think that a slow pace and lack of dialogue means art and deep. It is not. As a film studies teacher i've watched films with slow narrative, in fact many of my favourite films are slowly paced but this is snail like and its all over the place. It jumps from some kind of documentary shot (hand held running through yet more grass) and ambient sound to another beautiful shot of our main female character wearing a Vivien Westwood cut dress (was it fashion for native Americans to wear off the shoulder animal skins or 3/4 crop tops in 1608) Its awful. Go watch crash, Capote, walk the line, sideways even batman begins for modern Hollywood, this is dreadful. Its like watching a 10hr Calvin Klein or Tommy advert, i kept expecting them to whisper ""eternity by Calvin Klein"". There are some great shots but then not as good as many other films that have a fully explored plot depth and content. If you want deep and sexual frustration watch lost in translation. I can't think of another film that tries to be such an epic and fails so bad maybe water world....but even that film is better. For all those that keep saying how this is an art film, maybe try peter Greenaway, if you want to be visually stunned especially prospero's books, or the cook the thief his wife and her lover. This isn't art; its Hollywood trying to do subtle, and it doesn't work. An art film is not just something that looks pretty it is supposed to challenge the audience, the only challenge here is to sit all the way through.",2006
1,"This movie is not only slow and boring, it does not stick to historical fact. While the settlement of Jamestown looks the part, the civility and heroism of its inhabitants overestimates their moral worth. Furthermore, although the myth of the good savage is central to this movie (particularly through the Pocahontas character), the Western violence of the colonialism that comes with it is glossed over. The tragedy of the real Pocahontas is only hinted at.Terrence Malick proves once more how good he is at making pseudo-philosophical movies that make you yawn. He once more uses the long and slow pans of waving grass and the same annoying voice over as in The Thin Red Line.",2006

1,"Unfortunately, this movie's attempt to be ""art"" gets drowned in a painfully slow process. When just about every moment of this too-lengthy movie is overly dramatic with a slow-motion feel, its art loses any impact it may have had. There is some beautiful cinematography, but again it does not make up for the ponderous movement of the scenes and interaction between characters. Although the story was obviously about Captain Smith and Pocahontas, their relationship would have meant more to the viewer if other characters were more strongly built around them. The viewer also loses sense of time, especially when Pocahontas is suddenly very fluent with English with only a hint of how that happened. Two of the four of us watching it just couldn't handle the snail's pace, and the remaining two said it should have ended at least 15 minutes before it did. Even the action scenes were awkward with odd punctuations of the character Smith's thoughts. This story had awesome potential but was a huge letdown.",2006

I know what you're thinking...'7.5 on IMDb...that's pretty good.' Yeah, got me too. We read a review from a guy that said he would never go to the movies again because of this movie.

That is fine if it's done right, but more often than not, the movie jumped from scene to scene with HUGE gaps of time and story left out in between. I was constantly wondering what had just happened. Then there was the fact that nearly every other scene was of Pocohotas and/or John Smith in a field of tall grass, either walking slowly, running backwards laughing, caressing the other person, or running their hands across the grass.

And most of the other terrible movies I've seen were at least bad enough to be funny. This one is just awful. The running time is 150 minutes, not really long by today's standards, yet it feels infinitely longer. If you asked me to describe the movie in one word, I would probably have to use ""boring,"" but that really only begins to describe it. If you don't write too large, you could fit all the dialogue (including the intensely dull internal monologues) from the whole movie onto one 4x6"" note card, and the vast amount of parts when nobody speaks are also strangely devoid of music or sound effects. Last night was the first time ever that I could actually hear the film projector running. The movie is also full of so many jump-cuts that they have to have been put there deliberately, yet they have no purpose at all and are only jarring, and only further remind you that you're watching a crappy movie. The cast has a lot of really great actors, talent that is completely wasted on this movie. Jonathan Pryce, for example, is an exceptional actor, yet his role in The New World comprised sitting still, standing up, and clapping like an excited six-year-old. Sadly, this is not an isolated case in The New World. The worst part is that it is completely pointless. Throughout the entire move almost nothing happens. I really can't stress enough how lousy this movie is. Ironically, the popcorn I got was really good, but I didn't finish it. The movie was so bad, yet I sat through the whole thing.",2006

It isn't trying to win awards or stun the audience with special effects. You sit down, watch it, laugh a little, think about how cute the kids are, then go on with the rest of your day. A lot of action stars have taken a turn at comedy to soften their image, Stallone and Arnold S. to name a couple, so Vin Diesel is in good company there. I think it is a decent, light movie worth at least a matinée viewing. The kids are charmers, Vin Diesel doesn't seem to mind being the but of jokes, and most of the acting is good. And ladies, he spends most of the movie in tight t-shirts, and according to my wife has a nice posterior region. Guys you have to settle for Lauren Graham's sweet smile.",2005

Lauren Graham plays the principal of the school and the ""love"" interest for Vin Diesel very well. Their attraction is ""cute"" but not overdone. Brad Garrett as the vice-principal provides the off the wall character that is often presented in this script formula.

My (22-year-old) daughter and her friend are Vin Diesel fans, and I like stupid movies, so we went off to see this with no particular expectations. It was delightful! The acting was good, the writing was just off-kilter enough to surprise, and the plot, while predictable, was only predictable a few seconds in advance (which is about how long it took for Vin Diesel's character to process a thought). Our little group of cynics was charmed and quoting lines from the movie all the way home afterwards. We agreed that it was indeed a Disney movie, but it didn't have the cheesy hollowness and wannabe withitness that has hampered those productions since Hayley Mills was my age. Bits of it were unexpectedly moving. Vin Diesel's little side romance was also charming, with a breath of gentle kinkiness (""On land, you're the superior officer,"" he says to his honey, and she smirks.) Basically it was funny, stupid, and sweet without being annoying, and Vin Diesel was excellent in it.

So having Vin Diesel as a no nonsense Navy SEAL protecting a family of 5 kids in the middle of suburbia in a Disney release, no less, seemed like an artistic stretch. To ""The Pacifier""'s credit, it works. ""The Pacifier"" is predictable, and shamelessly sentimental at times, which is expected. Through it's charm, family message (invariably centered around discipline), and likable characters, ""The Pacifier"" becomes one of those rare commodities-- great family entertainment. I am a fan of Vin Diesel. In ""The Pacifier"" he proves to be a deft straight man. Props for Diesel. He is going out on a limb with his action hero persona, particularly in a hilarious bit with the ""Panda Dance"". Diesel is still a commanding physical presence, though this outing as a kinder, gentler Navy SEAL, Shane Wolfe, may hold promise for his longevity. He really displays a flair for light comedy. He has the kind of charm where he is never over shadowed by the cute kids-- that is no small feat.",2005

1,"This film was bad. There was nothing of value in this entire film. I have no idea how this film grossed a little over thirty million in its first weekend. There must have been a good trailer before it, or perhaps there was a generation of people that missed the film when it was originally called Kindergarten Cop. Either way, for an hour an a half we were duped into watching nothing more than scene after scene of diaper humor, a comically unbalanced Diesel wading through the supposed funny moments, a duck, scenes where the baby of the family is left unattended, sloppy (and I mean sloppy) editing, and quick resolutions that will leave the avid film watcher confused and disoriented. Coupled with cliché after cliché, Diesel proves that he is better left in the action genre, the leaving the humor to anyone else in the world except for him.",2005
1,"Vin why did you do this, why? This movie was dreadful and terrible. I really hated it so much. Who has a secret lab thing under their garage. Who hires a navy seal to watch their children? This movie stunk worser than New York Minute. The Pacifier wrestling move is only used once so why is that the name of this movie. Brad Garrett was a terrible actor in this having kids pick on Seth The Performer. Seth is really weird. He just takes off and starts a play. That Vin Diesel ends up directing for him because the director dropped out because of the children's terrible acting in the play. The movie makes no sense at all. I hated it so much and am glad I'm never watching it again",2005
3,"Poor film sorry Vin, i know its for kids but still its way off in timing and good jokes, it feels like its only running at 50% of what these actors can do. Big fan of Vin, i think he can act, he looks great on screen holding it well, he has a mean deep voice that makes you takes notice, he looks great kicking ass.........but he has no comic talent. Been built the way he is people will always want him to be Riddick or someone like him, i know as an actor been typecast as this will be a bad head for him as he will want to do other types of characters and branch out but the thing is his kick ass style is what draws people to see him, comic films have been tried by other big build guys Sly and Arnie, sly had no joy and Arnie was very lucky, he had 2 films which were made well but he had help on screen, pint size Danny in Twins kept the film moving and the tiny kids doing bad and silly things in KG Cop helped but only just mind, the time of ""oh look its that big hard man doing something silly""has gone, i know this film is doing well and is a hit for Vin but i hope its his last try at comedy or if he tries again to do it with someone as a sidekick to help him such as Tom Arnold as i think he is a great comic sidekick and would not steal the screen from Vin, as for me i hope we get one more RIDDICK film as they are so made for Vin.

2,"I did not like this movie at all. My mom took me and my sister as a special treat on a Thurday night. The acting was really bad by all except the crazy nanny, and the mom. There was maybe one funny part, it just did not work at all. I really like Vin too, but he needs a better supporting cast, especially in a comedy. There was one scene in which the oldest sister gets really emotional over her fathers death. She actually did a great job, and Vin reacted good too. However so much of this movie was based on dirty diaper humor, which only can go so far. The dirty diaper in the chucky cheese balls was not funny at all. Only the dirty diaper on the car windshield was funny and unexpected. It seems to me that all the young actors these days are from another movie. The younger sister was also in cheaper by the dozen, and she wasn't great in that either. Why don't they take the time to look for talent instead of relying on people from another movie. It should do well in video sales though, all kid movies do.",2005

7,"Just saw an advanced screening of this tonight. While it isn't the film that has been so brilliantly advertised, it's a very solid film. It feels a lot like ""Full Metal Jacket"" early on, but with more humor. Then, it becomes an entirely new animal. More of a psychological study. I would actually call this the ""Blair Witch Project"" of war films in that you (and the characters) know the Boogeyman's ""out there,"" you're just waiting for him to strike.

The film generally sets out the Corps as a unit that has no direction and their officers and staff NCO's are idiots (i.e the Bn Commander acting like a rock star during his speech to the troops in the tent). I assure you this simply not the case. I spent 27 months in Vietnam and never saw anyone in that type of setting that conducted themselves anything other than serious and professional. As aside, during my time in Nam I had six Bn commanders, so I know from experience these facts.",2005
5,"I finally watched this movie on Blu-Ray last night. I love war/military type films so I figured it should be enjoyable considering all the good reviews. I don't know if the Full Metal Jacket clone first 30-minutes turned me off the to the rest of the film or just the generic story and acting? I like Jamie Fox in The Kingdom, which is a much better film. Jake Gyllenhaal was brilliant in Zodiac and End of Watch. I don't know if I've seen a film that spent so much of it's dialog on cursing as this movie does. As the story progresses you really feel the movie start to drag a bit and wonder if anything is actually going to ever happen. In the end this Marine unit misses the war and there is no fighting or shooting at all. Then to wrap up the movie is a retarded party seen with everyone drinking around bonfires and shooting their guns in the end. The only real saving grace of this film is Lucas Black's character and Peter Sarsgaard to some extent. There are so many much better war/military films then this, including the above mentioned The Kingdom and Green Zone if you like Middle East zones. I must also say that if this is how Marines typically act and are organized, they certainly aren't the well oiled machine I thought they were supposed to be.",2015
4,"This is not your typical war movie. For others that may be okay but going into this I was expecting it to be somewhat similar to FMJ or Platoon. This movie revolves around the boredom and lives of the soldiers. There is not an ounce of action except for a man getting shot in the head in basic training. It was highly disappointing, all the buildup and hell of training and they do not get to use their skills. There are also random scenes throughout such as a horse covered in oil, and I was very annoyed when Gylenhall and Saarsgard are told not to take the shot and an air strike is called instead. Praise for Jamie Foxx's performance though and the bit of humor throughout.",2015

1,"What an awful movie. I was so surprised to see IMDb-visitors rated it 7.3 average! Yeah, yeah, I know, I am not ye' movie critic, but I do believe I have somewhat of an opinion, when it comes to movies. In fact, I consult IMDb rather often, before renting or buying a new DVD and I must say that (with very few exceptions) I always agree with the IMDb-rating of a movie (of whatever kind, by the way). Having heard a lot about Jarhead and IMDb's rating (from 6 and up, the movies are mostly good - real good), I saw Jarhead yesterday and I was very disappointed. Sam Mendes is a good director and I was left in awe. SO bad! The acting was far below anything I have ever seen. There's a bunch of B-movies with better acting. Jokes were not at all funny, drama was pathetic, tension, what tension? Realistic? All a bunch of crap. The storyline wasn't that bad, but it died in bad acting, useless scenes (what was that about his horse? - covered in oil, ah, how sad ... and then?). The burnt bodies lying around, the dead of Troy (was that Troy, by the way? - who cares?), his girlfriend who left him, the idiotic so-called climax when they bomb that base on the end. I am sorry, but I have no idea why you dudes and dudettes rated this movie so highly. Maybe I didn't understand? Was it all a satire on some movie I haven't seen? Was it supposed to be sad, shocking, cult? There was absolutely nothing in this film that caught my attention (except for the fact that I was bored throughout the whole thing). Could someone please explain me why he/she thinks this movie deserves a 7.3 avg? Not for a moment Jarhead was interesting (no, please, don't give me the: that's-exactly-what-it-was-about-crap - to film boredom, one must not bore the viewer with bad acting, bad jokes and emphasizing so much on (the lack of) sexual relationships. Das Boot didn't need all that. And THAT'S a movie, worth 9 outta 10! Anyway, sorry I saw it. But even more sorry for the fact that 'the people who are supposed to know' rated it that high. Guess I'll take IMDb's ratings not so close to heart anymore.",2006

I had such high expectations for this movie, and what was funny was as I picked up the movie some guy next to me said get ready to be disappointed. I didn't think anything of it because I like to see for myself before I listen to someone else's opinion. Well boy was he right, I thought this was supposed to be about the Gulf War, instead we hear more about how the main character (Jake Gyllenhaal) likes to masturbate.

7,"I had fun watching Red Eye. It's not a masterpiece, but it's well directed and structured. Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams are perfect in the role. Yes, it's the same old story with a different setting but Wes Craven gave it a good pace. At least not another Scream with the usual college killer. It's nice when you can see a clean, coherent thriller even when originality doesn't stand out as its main character. Particularly from a film-maker like Craven that has brought so many innovative ideas to the thriller and horror genre in the past and that now just lends himself to bringing home what could have been a good TV movie had it not been released theatrically. Good job!",2005

I think Cillian is a very good ""bad guy"" I loved his acting in Batman Beggins, and Rachel McAdams.. whoa! she's a beauty, and a good actress as well, but let's try to be a little objective here, the story mm mm... the direction mm mm... it lacks a lot of good suspense in fact is a really boring movie, but there's one good thing tho, it's a short movie, only 1 hour and 30 minutes (FOR ME IT WAS LIKE 10 MINUTES UNDER THE WATER!!!)",2005

1,"Wes Craven, you are having a laugh... at our expense. The Red Eye plot is preposterous... We are confronted by a guy who has apparently spent 8 weeks watching a girl, who then turns up at an airport behind her, flirts and chats her up successfully, somehow wangles a seat next to her in a two seat space, not trapped in the middle of a five seat row (contacts at check-in?) and is cheezily nice during a painfully slooooow build up. Then, once up in the air, in a confined space, surrounded by strangers, he immediately starts threatening the vacuous, if super-efficient, Rachel McAdams and saying tosh like 'we got ya daddy, do what I say, or poppa gets it'. Well, forgive me, but didn't they already have her daddy ready for slaughter-so-you-better-oughta long before she stepped on the plane and therefore wouldn't it have been oh, sooooooo much simpler to simply snatch the gal off the street and terrorise her in a room somewhere, forgetting the complicated and insecure dad plot, pulling her nails out or whatever until she made the all important 'call' required? Or even - cos this is the movies and we need a few unreal twists - keep the dumb dad-in-distress thing intact if you must, but dress it up better so that holding him in harms way until the convoluted plot had been concluded made some sense, without the plane dumbdown? Alternatively, without wanting to sound like an actual thinking terrorist/assassin - couldn't the massive bazooka-missile thang employed have been far more easily used on, say, a car driving down the highway, with the politician inside, rather than the 50th story of a Miami seafront hotel, from a fishing boat (mind you, as we already know, security in Miami is lax, so they'll speed away)? I know, I know, far more fun to go through watching a pretty girl for 8 weeks, burgle her dads house to steal his wallet (that somehow - star trek style - gets transported from Miami to Texas instantly) in order to - perhaps - get her to arrange for a politician to change hotel room and, and, and... Well, a thousand things could go wrong here, each one entirely destroying the Big Plan, so why not slim the elements down to a sensible handful, such as - 1. bazooka. 2. car. 3. boom! My 50 minute drive home from the cinema was spent highlighting the abundance of flaws and stupid cod-Hitchcockian twists, which sadly was the best fun of the whole sorry experience. And as for security back at Miami Airport... we have an apparently crazy and violent girl running off a plane, chased by cops, who during the chase sits down to have a coffee, moves elsewhere to read a magazine at a bar, then runs again like crazy up and down the whole terminal... by now also chased by crazed Cillian Murphy (no CCTV then? - I had guns pulled on me for parking in the wrong place for 10 seconds at Miami Airport a couple of years back). So instead of speaking to the cops - her allies - or getting on the blower at a call-box direct to her dad to warn him his life is in danger, McAdams prefers instead to steal a People Carrier off a family in the Airport forecourt (call the damned security...) and drives home to daddy, mowing down the assassin with the vehicle in the front garden of the house, in a rich neighbourhood-watch district, crushing the front porch in the process - an act which actually slightly wakes dad up from an afternoon snooze, after about a minute, yet which somehow fails to register with neighbours who aren't even mildly curious, thus ensuring 15 more minutes of hide and seek shenanigans as the duo run around the vast Hollodeck type house... Dohhh, it actually hurts to keep thinking about it all - Cillian (surely renamed Silly 'un for doing this one?) preposterously turns from ice assassin to comically unhinged (and inept) lunatic killer at the end, this theoretically ruthless despatcher of human life now allowing the dad to live so that he can watch his daughter getting her goose cooked. I'd better stop, because the stream of drivel I'm writing here must sound as uncoordinated as the Red Eye script. If Ms McAdams hadn't been allowed to get on the plane in the first place the title could have been altered, from 'Red Eye' to 'No Eye, Dear'. RR",2005

Not much to chew on here in the way of a theme, but if you just get in your seat, turn your brain off, watch the fancy camera work, and enjoy the plot, you will have a great time. The plot is well worn, and regular movie goers will probably know more or less what to expect by about ten minutes in. But that didn't bother me, as I enjoyed watching it unfold. In the old days, they might not have focused so tightly on just two characters, and there were some enticing moments when I hoped they were going to let some other people have a few lines. But these folks were probably right to keep the movie so tightly focused. The plot got me by the throat fairly early on, and never let go. It's not a good idea to think too much either during or after the movie. as I'm not sure it makes a great deal of sense. Just sit back and enjoy.",2005

For those of you who have seen Batman Begins, his character was much scarier in this film. He played his character very well. The scariest ""bad guy,"" I have seen in awhile. Rachel McAdams was great. Everyone in the audience laughed, gasped and cheered at the same time, as if we were on cue. The suspense is held through out the movie. THe amazing part is that the end was not anti-climatic. I was not disappointed in the end. I felt satisfied. The trailer does not do the movie justice.

3,"The main reasons to see ""Red Eye"" are Rachel McAdams, who delivers a stellar performance, and Jayma Mays, who is wonderful as the Assistant Hotel Manager. On the other hand, Cillian Murphy overacts so badly that he becomes cartoonish. The rest of the movie is riddled with plot holes, on which I will elaborate.",2005
10,"The problem with most thrillers is that they are not very thrilling. Rather they tend to be formulaic and producers know they can eventually move the final product, good or bad, to cable, so they invariably populate the story with B-level actors or unknowns. Harsh but true. The marvel of Red Eye is that it is a thriller elevated to the status of cult classic by highly focused casting. Hitchcock in his day understood that 1000 failings of the script and/or direction could be forgiven if the audience was able to connect early with the characters. And that's exactly what happened here. Murphy -- remember this is the guy who is considered to have delivered the best Elvis impersonation of all time -- happily and zestfully digs deep into the role of psycho killer. But, make no mistake, this film owes everything to McAdams. She is the chewy chocolate centre of this piece, the audience connects with her early on, develops empathy, and spends the rest of the film watching her facial expressions -- just as you would a close friend -- to see how she is doing. McAdams is one of the handful of stars to have aced the transition from teen wonder to adult star and as this review is penned (2013) she shows no sign of slowing down. Other critics have noticed something especially interesting about her performances. No, I am not making this up. She glows. She shines. The more important the scene, the more she seems to light it up - internally. Very few actors have ever been credited with this talent but I suspect in her case the gift is real. This film would have been a half-baked wonder but for the presence of Rachel McAdams. It will, I believe, over time elevate it to classic status.",2013
6,"Wes Craven's psychological thriller ""Red Eye"" isn't something we haven't already seen, but the standard format actually generates into a tight, snappy and gripping experience. After breaking away from its vulnerable, claustrophobic intensity. Craven effectively heightens the suspense, for a heart stopping and dazzling last-half potboiler, despite some elaborate and questionable details. This is sure a different mood for Craven, and you probably wouldn't know it was he behind it. Being short and sweet makes the flying time go by in no time. Quantity seems to be replaced with quality, but still this is a streamlined lightweight commercial flight for audiences. The taut premise builds up nicely, because of an always engagingly sharp and sly script. However it does seem to get quite silly, and overstated towards the spontaneous closing. Even the whole set-up is very wishy-washy. One of its driving factors were the profound lead performances. The lovely Rachael McAdams gives a dedicated, headstrong performance. Opposite of her is a sensationally suave, but sinisterly steely Cillian Murphy. The two gelled very well, and their back-and-forth banter was expertly delivered.

10,"My wife got her hands on some free passes to go see this on Wednesday from a local radio station. If it had not been for that, I probably would not have seen the movie. The trailer REALLY made this movie look uber-stupid. First off, it was NOT what I expected. When I thought ""Wes Craven"", all I had in mind was ""cheesy horror movie"". Well, let's get that right out there, THIS IS NOT A HORROR MOVIE!!!! OK, now that we understand that, let me say this: IT WAS EXCELLENT!!!! It was more of a psychological thriller/action movie, which for some reason reminded me of the movie ""Speed"" (1994, Keanu Reeves) to a degree. It had plenty of tension, action and a very hateable bad guy (played VERY convincingly by Cillian Murphy - who by the way, had better be careful about not getting type-cast as ""the bad guy"" in all his movies, because he does a very GOOD psycho!). Anyway, it was all around a great flick with an ending I did NOT expect -- but I'll leave that for you to experience.",2005
10,"I saw Red Eye tonight at a sneak preview with a group of friends and everyone in our party thought it was excellent. The movie holds your attention throughout the entire time and the characters are so believable that you really get into the movie. Red Eye is definitely a must-see for the summer of 2005 and I would recommend this film to anyone! I can't remember when I have gone to a film and been held in suspense like I was during the 2 hours that I watched this film. Rachel McAdams and Cillian Murphy are perfect against one another and Wes Craven has done an excellent job in directing. This is going to be a major hit, in my opinion. Plan to see it when it comes out in mid-August!",2005
9,"Every action has a reaction, and watching ""Capote"", we can't help but wonder how it ever got made. ""Capote"" is entrancing, dark, depressing, and quite satisfying. It benefits from Hoffman's perfect performance. He embodies the physical and psychological make up of a man who was the toast of the nation before and after the publication of its classic novel, ""In Cold Blood"". As a human being, he appeared to be an intelligent, fascinating, and manipulative creature. He could have gotten away with almost anything. Then he found the two criminals behind one of the most heinous crimes of the century and might have gotten to the realization he could also be trapped by their own dark existences.",2005
10,"Like the non-fiction novel and the Richard Brooks film that was made from it, ""In Cold Blood,"" ""Capote"" focuses on and sympathizes with two killers at the expense of the four murdered members of the Clutter family. Once the viewer gets beyond this sticking point, however, all three works are outstanding, unforgettable experiences. Unlike the book and the original movie, ""Capote"" does explore the contradictory feelings that author Truman Capote wrestles with as he researches and writes ""In Cold Blood."" His feelings for Perry Smith, the more ""sensitive"" of the two killers, are particularly problematic as Capote becomes emotionally close to Smith and helps the men with legal aide that postpones the executions, while at the same time Capote cannot finish his book until Smith and Hickcock are hanged. Praise for Philip Seymour Hoffman's uncanny performance as Truman Capote cannot be overstated and, come awards time, if he does not collect enough accolades to fill his mantel, indictments for film critics and Academy voters would be in order. Hoffman not only captures the mannerisms and voice of Capote, he inhabits the man's soul and expresses his feelings and emotions without histrionics or the type of caricature that mimics often have made of the notoriously fey writer in the past.",2005
9,"The easiest role for an actor to play is a historical figure - we have no idea how Julius Caesar really sounded, how he moved his body, punctuated his speech, bit his lip, walked into a room, held his cigarette. The hardest role is the living, or recently deceased, celebrity whom we watched, heard, studied, mimicked and thought we understood. JFK, Martin Luther King, Ray Charles, and, above all, the inventor of self referential celebrity, Truman Capote (with apology to Andy Warhol and, of course, Noel Coward)..",2005
10,"This moving film lives and breathes on the powerful shoulders of Phillip Seymour Hoffman's stunning performance in the title role. Hoffman captures all of the unique physical characteristics that made Capote such a familiar public figure in his lifetime and invests them with a humanity that is almost unbearably poignant. The film focuses on Capote's research on the book ""In Cold Blood"" and the personal journey that his relationship and identification with killer Perry Smith became (Capote says at one point that it was like they grew up in the same house, and he went out the front door while Perry went out the back), a compelling and complicated relationship that this uncompromising film presents in moving detail. But what truly makes it a unique work of art is the brilliant work of Hoffman - always an interesting actor - whose performance as Truman Capote should elevate him to the pantheon of film giants.",2005
10,"Brilliant portrayals are chilling. Philip Seymour Hoffman's invocation of the essence of Truman Capote is mesmerizing. I suspect that most of the readers on websites such as these may not have stored memories of Capote in the 60's. An unlikely media darling, I vividly recall his flaunting gay affectations and cosmopolitan barbs. Hoffman's detailed and incisive performance implores, ""And the Oscar goes to........"" ",2005

10,"Beautifully told, masterfully performed, harrowing, amusing, cruel, moving. A sensational achievement. I sat there disturbed and transfixed. Witnessing the impossible. Truman Capote with the mask, without the mask. The same man, different men, all men, no man. The creature at work, thinking of work, planning his work, working his work, wheeling an dealing. Living his life, life as work, work as life. An ego bigger than his talent and all talent and no ego. Feeling without feeling. Cunning, innocent, blasphemous, a child, a monumental son of a bitch. Philip Seymour Hoffman surprising us again. Charles Laughton I thought. What a thought! Charles Laughton 2005. That kind of talent that kind of boldness and brains. Everything and everyone in ""Capote"" seem to be. To be totally. I've never seen a photograph of Harper Lee but I imagine her just like Catherine Keener. The film is a miracle of sorts. I can't wait to see it again.",2005
8,"Director Bennet Miller's ""Capote"" is a film that shows great intelligence in the way it captured the essence of Truman Capote, a man who achieved fame and notoriety with most of the fiction he wrote.

10,"What PSH has pulled off here simply cannot be overpraised. First he accomplishes a perfect imitation- the voice, the gestures, the walk. Then, within this caricature, he delivers a startlingly complex and subtle performance. First he's the preening bon vivant, indulged by friends and lovers, intimately tied to the world of the rich and famous. Then during some of his self-absorbed monologues he becomes something else, genuinely penetrating on the subject of the human condition. Then you see how cynically he uses that ability to get what he wants. So much sincere emotion demonstrated in the service of lies. His cruelty is such that one feels indignation for the murderous sociopath who becomes his muse. But at the same time, his ambition to do something great is totally understandable, and the cost to his psyche so visibly demonstrated, that he remains a sympathetic character.",2005
8,Capote Reviewed by Sam Osborn,2005
8,"CAPOTE, first of all, is a well written film by the talented Dan Futterman, whose performance in URBANIA we will always remember, and for Philip Seymour Hoffman, this is his ""Golden Globe and Oscar Award"" all in one. From the first scene, Hoffman creates the essence of the acid tongued, tremendously talented, yet damaged, Truman Capote.",2005
6,"""Capote"" is a film with undeniable assets: it's got the best performance by an American actor in the last decade and some of the wittiest dialog in an American film in recent years. Philip Seymour Hoffman's once-in-a-lifetime performance is simply jaw-dropping (and he's aware of it): it's a triumph of vocal and body work, with a huge range (mentally and emotionally), but above all it sparkles with supremely intelligent acting in portraying the lizard man with the 215-point I.Q. and the 1,000,000-point ego.",2006
7,"I saw a press screening of this film recently, and was highly impressed by its moving account of the period in Truman Capote's life during which he wrote 'In Cold Blood'. The direction by the relatively unknown Bennett Miller is personal, evocative and affecting, but without being over-dramatic or saccharine. This is helped immensely by Philip Seymour Hoffmann's incredible performance as Capote, as well as solid acting from Catherine Keener, Clifton Collins Jr., and Chris Cooper. Cooper plays K.B.I. Agent Alvin Dewey with perhaps a bit too much intensity, given his relatively small amount of screen time, but the portrayal nonetheless comes off as heart-felt.",2005
9,"Philip Seymour Hoffman, who we first noticed in *Scent of a Woman* some 13 years ago when he turned a fairly clichéd character into a memorable character study, finds his apotheosis -- some would say his inevitable apotheosis -- as Truman Capote in Bennett Miller's *Capote*. The writer died in 1984, and furthermore had spent the last 15 or so years of his life in relative seclusion, if you disregard his addled presence at Studio 54 and the occasional ""Tonight Show"" appearance. Therefore, to someone like myself, reared in the Seventies and Eighties and carrying no burning memories of the fellow, the exactitude of Hoffman's mimicry of Capote is neither here nor there. This is, above and beyond any caviling about how precise Hoffman's impersonation is of Capote, a full-bodied, well-rounded character, whose primary interest in serving the film is to make us consider the wages of art.",2005
10,"It's pretty rare to find yourself facing a screen, watching a film for the first time, and knowing without a single conceivable doubt that you are witnessing precious moments that are sure to define an actor's entire career. I felt this when watching Phillip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote. It is undeniably his best performance ever, and will be nearly impossible to top. He deserves an Oscar for this and his chances of winning are already more than excellent.",2005
2,"This is one dreary, inert, self-important bore. When the only thing that suddenly gives a film life is a hanging, you know the venture is botched. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Truman Capote as a narcissistic, tic-ridden, self-indulgent, cartoon-voiced, insect-like caricature. Why he is this way is never explained and we get scant background information. The script focuses on Capote's writing of 'In Cold Blood' and his attachment to the damaged brothers who murdered a family of four. The acclaimed writer of 'To Kill A Mockingbird', Harper Lee (Catherine Keener), accompanies Capote in his initial inquires into the crime, and her presence immediately suggests a far more interesting subject for a biopic. Unfortunately, Lee is quickly sidelined in favor of endless scenes of Capote bemoaning his pained existence. Watching him is like watching Dr. Smith from 'Lost in Space' complain about his ""delicate back"" to anybody who will listen for two hours. The difference, however, is that Smith was fun to watch while Capote is not. The film's precious self-importance kills it, as does director Bennett Miller's reluctance to add any kind of shading. Like the morose piano score, the film is a one note wonder, providing no contrast, no emotional coloring, and no intimate drama. If Capote really was this irritating, why make a film about him and expect audiences to watch it? Though the supporting roles are well performed (Chris Cooper is his usual stalwart self), they serve such little dramatic purpose because, ultimately, it's all about Capote(!) Director Bennett and screenwriter Dan Futterman fail to emotionally engage their intended audience because they were clearly overwhelmed by the cultural baggage of Capote's ""legend"". Their product is stillborn Oscar bait...and is more evidence that one great genre pic has more ""truth"" in it than a dozen piles of oh-so-sincere crap like this.",2006
10,"As I scroll through the other user reviews what I notice is that the ones that disliked the film all claim that it was ""boring"". That's fair, if you haven't read 'In Cold Blood', I suppose. The first time I watched this, I fell asleep during it because I was just unable to follow. But then I read the book, one that is considered a great piece of American literature. Watching the film a second time was a much different experience. I hung on every word that Capote had to say in wonder and excitement. The way the film depicts Capote's process as he does his work and how he relates to Perry, it's truly fascinating. ",2017
10,"I saw Truman Capote dozens of times; he was a staple of the talk show circuit. One of the greatest TV moments was when he called Wilbur Mills a racist in the most subtle way that the Georgia governor took about half a minute to realize what had happened. This man was a firebrand. He never backed down from anything, despite his effeminate ways and small stature. Unfortunately, he word his celebrity on his sleeve and was often overly harsh and full of himself. This is a great movie. The subtle methods he uses to draw out the story from the murderer shows that he would do anything to get a story, even lie to a person with whom he had begun to fall in love. He pictures himself as compassionate at times, but he is often unwilling to go that final mile. It's surprising he was in attendance at the hangings, the events that probably contributed to his death. What a complex man. His canon of American literature is small but he was a master stylist and commentator. See this movie for Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance. It is one of the greatest in cinematic history. We remember Capote. He is Capote!",2007

My feelings now having seen this movie is that he is and still remains a good supporting actor.",2006

8,"""Capote"" opens up as a ghostly recreation.

1,"First of all, I was expecting wonders with this film. I spent my ten dollars happily and expected a film better than Brokeback Mountain. I expected to be dazzled by Philip Seymour Hoffman because I was blown away by Heath Ledger, and so many critics seem to have chosen Hoffman over Ledger's amazing performance in Brokeback Mountain. I think my first mistake was allowing myself to have expectations. In no way did this film move or amaze me. I have just finished a film class and every aspect I had studied shone through (terribly) in this movie. The cinematography was, at times, completely flawed and fake, the music was simply awful, the plot was overly presented, and Hoffman annoyed me instead of capturing me. The movie is a little over 2 hours, but I felt it was five. The film is supposed to take place over a period of five years (they even skipped a year) but it seemed to drag on and on. Less than halfway through the film, I found myself bored and wondered when in the world it would end. The worst thing about the film was the extremely short scenes that would begin to offer a sparkle of good information about Capote's life, but instead stopped and left the viewer wondering what in the world just happened and why the scene even existed. Yes, Capote was a show-off and often a liar, but this was shown extremely poorly. Hoffman's effeminate voice and lisp were annoying, but I could look past it as this was Capote's real voice, but also, he over acted at times. Instead of being amazed, I was horrified. For some reason, the critics are in love with this man's performance, while I saw little that qualified this as ""the performance of his career"".",2006
10,"Honestly, I don't care about dates. I don't care about names, or stats, or if the writers got a bunch of stats confused.

To believe that some people can actually watch a movie and then complain that the time line is off with reality is beyond my comprehension. Who cares about the time line!

Carter has the players sign a contract to keep their grades up or be suspended from the team. When it is known that his players are not making the grade average and/or just not showing up for class; community outrage erupts when Carter benches his undefeated team and locks them out of the gym.

8,"'Coach Carter' is based on a true story of Coach Ken Carter, a controversial high school basketball coach played by Samuel L. Jackson. Coach Carter took the coaching job under his rules. He believed that the players must maintain good grades and become a united team or they would not play. All the team players signed his contract to do just that. The team was undefeated and on it's way to the 1999 State Championship, when Coach Carter received the low grades of his players. Coach Carter received national attention when he locked the gym and benched the whole team for poor grades. Coach Carter received some praise and much more criticism for his decision. This is a good inspirational movie of what one must do to excel in sports and in life. Coach Carter taught his players that they must be committed and work hard to excel. This is good movie for people who like sports. (Paramount, Run time 2:16, Rated PG-13)(8/10)",2005
7,"Coach Carter is the story of a basketball coach who was persistent and had his priorities straight. The positive message the movie conveyed was that lives can be changed for the better through self discipline, hard work and the building of character.

I then swiped the movie from my father's house and watched it every night for 3 nights straight. Here are the things that caught my attention.",2010
10,"I was expecting nothing more than a basketball movie and at first was only going to watch this because there was nothing to do. At the end of the movie I was almost going to cry. I loved the movie so much. It wasn't just about basketball, about the story of the greatest basketball coach that ever lived. I loved the move, it was inspiring sad movie with some violence. I think there were about 80 people in the theatre and about 75 ended up crying at the end of the movie. It was detailed and shows how far a coach would go in order to put his team on the path of discipline, honour and commitment. My rating for this movie is an absolute 10/10.

Jackson gives one of his best performances as the new head basketball coach at his high school alma mater. Carter makes his team do sprints, pass, and play as winners not just as individual players. Plus he makes the team keep at least a C+ average in school and that they attend classes. When they fail to keep that average, he cancels practices and some games until they keep their grades up. I personally like what Coach Carter teaches them. Basketball will not always be there for them. If they get an education, they can have a life after high school and even go on to college. Coach Carter makes his team winners both on and off the court. I wish there were more coaches like Coach Carter in both high school and college to prepare young people for life as adults.",2005
2,"This film is just another entirely ponderous exercise in star power fizzling and prestige film-making gone pretentious. I didn't care for this movie in the least. If this crud makes $1 over its budget, The studio would be wise to declare victory, round up all available copies, store them deep within the nuclear waste repository under Yucca Mountain, and then never make another movie like it again. Coach Carter is a prime example of what happens when there's too little source material for a movie screenplay.

No director/actor pair could work better. I typically don't like sports movies because they are too predictable: the team always wins!! How predictable!! On this movie, however, the team actually loses! Imagine my surprise! But by that point I realized that that was not the point of the movie. It's now how you play the game, it's how hard you tried, what lessons your learned. It's just like boot camp getting ready to go to war. Except there are no lethal weapons involved. Just a ball!",2005
10,"This movie isn't just about sport but has an underlying moral message which is been shown throughout the film. Sport won't get you far unless your a great but study and hard work in school will get you everywhere. Enter, a town that is quite poor and a basketball team who just want to win. Once Ken Carter accepts the job, the whole team changes and it is for the better. Another message this film teaches is respect, at the beginning just after meeting the boys, Ken expresses a need for the boys to show respect not only for themselves but for their friends and elders. He does this by explaining how the word 'nigger' can be used as a degrading term and how by dressing themselves with respect, behaving respectfully isn't bad at all.",2005
3,"I guess this movie is a tragedy, but not in the sense it was intended. The real tragedy in this movie is not losing in the playoffs but the abortion of the child.

What message is that trying to send? ",2005
7,"Coach Carter was an excellent sports film that will keep you interested the entire movie. Other than basketball, there are many sub-issues that are entertaining such as the players relationships with their girlfriends, the coach's life outside the court as well as many other things.I think this is one of the best basketball films since Hoosiers and any film-goer or sports fan would think the same. Samuel L. Jackson of course did excellent as usual. There were many new actors in the film as well that made there presence known. With the drama on the court, there was also some hysterical scenes which made people laugh and was a good mix into the film.",2005

3,"Shame, shame, shame. I actually enjoyed the first Saw quite a bit, and had hopes that this installment would meet or surpass its predecessor in quality. Poor guess on my part. I am a huge fan of horror movies...I have been watching them since I was a child. This was no horror movie. It was a poorly put-together ""psychological"" thriller with some violence in it. Part of what made the first movie good was the anonymous evil-doer. Having Jigsaw out and front all the time just didn't do it for me. The movie tries to justify his motivations, but his diatribes into the human condition fall short of convincing me. Fear of the unknown is one of the strongest types of fear there is, and having the killer spell out all his intentions is really kind of a let down. Also, the twist just left me snoring. And another thing (whine whine whine) was that I just could not suspend my disbelief. So there is this terminal cancer patient who can barely walk, yet is able to put many large sturdy devices together. Sure, he has help, but look at all the gear setup, and you'll see what I'm getting at. Also, Jigsaw must be psychic. His big ransom is the son of the detective. So he sets up all these traps in order to reach a desired outcome. What if people dropped dead from the nerve gas early? What if one of the criminals flipped out and killed the boy early? Sure, he might have profiled them, but I had some of these same issues with Mindhunters. The kicker is that I just don't care about any of the characters in this movie. They're all jerks, and it doesn't pain me to see them die. The end. Don't see this movie, it is a waste of time.",2006
1,"This is my first post on IMDb. The reason I am devoting my first post to such a crappy movie is the 7/10 rating here fooled me into renting this DVD and now I want my money and time back. The biggest issue of this film is its lackluster plot. It's just painfully dumb comparing to similar film like ""Cube"" , which was shot ~ 10 yrs ago (are films getting better today ?). In ""Cube"", you also got people waking up inside some closed cell and they need to solve some puzzle to find their way out. But in SAW II, there isn't really any puzzle to solve. For the most part of the movie, you just watch the characters running around and getting killed. There is no intelligence involved in this movie. BTW, the characters are poisoned, this greatly compromises their mobility and thus makes it a lot harder for them to move from A to B, which in turn lengthens the film a lot. Also the traps are pretty lame. Another issue is that the characters are so stereotypical (loud and rowdy). The moment they are first introduced, I know they will start killing each other before long. Overall the movie deserves 1/10 and I wish I could give it -10^10 just to counter balance all the positive ratings this film doesn't deserve. Seriously, if you think this movie is good, you should watch ""Cube"" and think about the improvement filmmakers have achieved over 10 yrs. Also you should watch ""Cabin Fever"" coz it's an equally crappy movie and crappy movies have a lot in common.",2006

4,"OK, if you've already seen the first one, you will be absolutely disappointed. it in no way lives up to the first one at all. first of all, saw was great because it was two kids on a low budget writing a script. they had to make up for the lack of money with the plot and script. secondly, the plot was really good and thick and everyone was connected in some odd way. the ending had so many twists, it was just brilliant. OK, now for saw 2. they had more money, so they definitely used it. instead of the people being in one room, it was one huge house. having more money took away from the effect, and most definitely the script, the plot and the acting. the plot had an unbelievable amount of holes in it. the people were connected by one stupid little line and the ending was absolutely ridiculous. one of the characters is just a complete idiot and decides to just get mad about everything. so, when he finds out there are numbers on the back of people's necks, instead of just kindly asking them to turn around, he kills them! finally, someone points out that he has a number on the back of his head that he's going to need, so he can't kill everyone. first of all, he tries seeing it with his little knife, then he decides to just cut it off, as any logical person would do. then, the murderer, john some how came up with a lot of money between dr gordon and now. before hand, his technique was simple. the tools he used to murder people could be found at a yardsale. in this one, somehow he got surgical equipment, the brains to do surgery and about five places with 20 computers. at some point in time, the writers seemed to have decided that it didn't matter that he had cancer, he can still do all this stuff. however, when you see him, he's in pretty bad shape. OK, now for the ending. remember the changed druggy, amanda? well, apparently, after she was almost killed, she decided the entire idea was a good one. so, she comes to john as an apprentice and decides to take his place as jigsaw. john becomes her yoda and teaches her the way of murder. at the end of saw 1, john had the memorable line of ""GAME OVER"". it was so great because of his voice, his appearance, everything. at the end of saw 2, amanda comes in, looking like she just went shopping and got her hair done and put on make up, and in a very little girl voice says ""game over"". absolutely horrible.",2005
2,"I am of course being sarcastic. This movie was gore for the sake of gore. When I first made that complaint, my friend told me that it was supposed to be a psychological thriller. Well I failed to see the psychology in it......either I didn't get it as he said......or I did and that the movie was only an extremely long prologue to set up the end. That of course meaning there is going to be a Saw III. That being the case I'm glad I paid to watch a 100 minute trailer for a movie that have no desire to see, and furthermore will instantly refuse to see the moment someone drags me away to see it despite any reviews. I saw good luck to those in the movie that were trying to build careers and use it as a stepping stone. And Donnie Wahlberg, I'm sorry you made such a horrible mistake as being in this franchise.",2006
3,"This movie is bad, not Uwe Boll bad, but just really bad. There is no character development, hell half the characters names aren't even spoken, there is no reason to care about any of them, the dad is a idiot and the kid is whiny, the ending is stupid, all I'm giving this movie credit for is the gore, which it has plenty of. I regret seeing this movie. Only people who would ever like this movie are emo kids and slipknot/mudvayne fans. It's very predictable and the ""twist"" ending had no build up it just happens because all horror movies nowadays try to have a twist ending, don't waste your time with this crap, go watch A History of Violence or just stay at home and watch Suspiria, Really I'm just writing another line because I hope no one watches this crap, though I'm late because the millions of angst ridden sad teenagers flocked to it opening weekend, I just watched it because I liked the first one's creativity which there wasn't any of in this movie, I hope saw 3 is better, and trust me, THERE WILL BE A SAW 3!",2005
5,"Let's start by saying what this movie did have, that will take a lot less time. Gore check. Creepy puppet and various devices used to permanently dismantle people's craniums check. Pasty cancer victim forcing the ""unworthy"" to develop some want to survive check. Alright, now that that's done I can move on to other, more pressing issues.",2005
8,"This movie has just mad a quantum leap in horror films. after watching this movie i had the chills walking to my car, and lets say that i more than enjoy a scary movie. this movie kept me up for at least and hour after watching it. it was one of those movies were you cant let it out of your mind. ",2005
6,"I have the same main problem I had with Saw II that I had with the original (Shockingly enough, not the gaping plot holes). At the core, both movies are about the same thing: Elaborate puzzles that stupid people ignore so they can spend more time yelling at each other.",2005
5,"Although this follow-up to the marvellous 2004 thriller 'Saw' is nowhere near as great as the original, it is still a good film worth watching.",2006
10,"The first Saw really through me through some spins and caught me off guard for originality, Saw 2 is leagues above the first. Saw 2 runs with the same game based theme as the first, with clues for both the characters and the audience about what might happen next, but it takes the game to a completely different level. Just when things start to come together there is another twist to leave the viewer on the edge of their seat for what may come next. Without seeming to give everything away the movie was made to give it all away, but no one can catch all the clues because they have been pulled so deep into the movie. I highly recommend this one.",2005
9,"The tag line says it all: Oh yes, there will be blood!",2005
1,"When I had seen the first movie I already had mixed feelings about it, part of me liked it mostly because of the ending and an other part of me thought it could have been better because of the lack of suspense. (Every ""game"" except the one with the two guys are being told which made it less interesting) Anyway, I still bought the DVD since the whole idea was quite interesting. So before I went to Saw II I had high hopes, also because IMDb rated it a 7.",2006
10,"I anxiously waited for this film to be released---eagerly anticipating every frame, and I was not disappointed when I ""saw"" the first screening this afternoon. From the opening scene thru the end? I found myself being transported into the big screen, taken for one of the wildest rides I have ever experienced, and deposited back into my seat knowing I had not wasted my money (nor the afternoon, for the matter). I was kept guessing until the end, and I was not let down with a ""cliched and wrap it up"" ending...I left wanting more. (Having seen CUBE...I don't see the ""ripoff""...I see a very well thought out original script with a deeper story). The acting was very impressive and very believable. A special shout out to the team who came up with the set design and atmospheric lighting. I was moved and mentally manipulated by this film, and when I stepped out of the theater into the lobby and real life I had to take a minute to let my mind unwind before I went out the theater door.",2005
10,"Why is it that so many critics, movie-goers and film patrons see such bold and unique forms of film as nothing but bloody and un-needed garbage? Isn't it about time to enter the age of the modern horror film, and to realize that audiences these days have already seen it all when it comes to the horror movie, so one-of-a-kind ideas such as the SAW series should be seen as a much needed godsend to the film industry. They say that this is what is takes to scare people these days: untrue. Take the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre for instance, upon close examination, one can notice that it is essentially a bloodless film. So what is it about such movies that scare us? Well, it's the idea, the cinematography, and the boldness to plant such a terrifying seed into the world of movies. It isn't a man sawing his foot off or a man being set on fire that scares audiences, it's the fact that it has NEVER...EVER been done before on the big screen that engulfs the audience into a trance-like cloak of fear over a movie. The people who conjure these ideas for movies are not on the mindset to create something for the SOLE PURPOSE of making someone cringe and fray, they want to be their own level, nay, rank of movies for others to, essentially, build off of. Are SAW and SAW II the last of their kind? By no means, if anything they are merely predecessors of the film noir that is going to eventually rise into the R-rated spectrum. Forgive me for not stressing on the movie's actual content, but I feel it is the very ideas behind SAW that make us have to see it for ourselves. And I highly recommend those of you skeptical about it to do so. Will you be frightened? Yes. Will you see things never before shined onto the screen? Yes. And will you leave the darkness of the theater in a sense that you have witnessed movie history unfold before your eyes? YES.",2005
9,I just got back from the midnight screening of the film and I must say -- It was an OK movie.,2005
10,"I loved this movie for many reasons. The acting was so much better then in the first one, and the plot twists are good as well. Kept me on the edge of my seat and the gore is at its best. When watching the movie, it is very fun to try to guess what is going to happen at the end. Make sure that you listen to the killer(John) very closely, as you know from the first, it is very important to do this. I can't stress enough how much better the acting and over-all story of this movie is, I don't want to give away to much, but be prepared for an awesome show. If you liked Saw, you will LOVE Saw 2, if you hated it or didn't see it, good chance you will still love it. It is worth the ticket to get in, and then some. In fact, I'll go see it again tomorrow.",2005
1,"Horrible acting for the start, shitty overestimated screenplay, and cheap directing. Jesus! Even the sets are like taken from ""The Bold And The Beautiful"" and the lightening only makes you sure that what you're looking on is nothing but cardboard. This film has all the sins of the first ""Saw"", and adds few by its own. I hope that parts 3-8 will be available only on video cassettes. Or maybe I will be happy person, and the series will end on part 6 for example! My God I watched it in fast forward and even then it was boring!...And above all - it was predictable. Even the unpredicted turns of the story, were predictable, because from the first minute YOU KNOW, that it HAS TO end reversal, and unexpectedly :). ",2006
7,"The original Saw was probably my most favorite recent ""horror"" movie, so naturally I was excited when the second one came out. I saw it its opening weekend in theaters, and **THIS WAS IN PREVIEWS, SO I Don't CONSIDER IT A SPOILER** I see a man strapped to a chair, with this ""Man in the Iron Mask""-like thing on with all sorts of pretty nails poking toward his face. If you've seen the first one, you can expect what it does. A TV turns on, and there's the puppet thing, and that creepy voice. I'm like ""Hell yes!"" and it seemed like a great beginning, and it truly does have a great idea going for it, but unfortunately it seems like they got lost in the success of the original and the new bigger budget and lost something. It became the traditional horror movie, with your typical predictable characters, and the innovation and claustrophobic feel of the original was gone. It wasn't scary, but then again I didn't think the first one was to be honest, I think they're more of a mental experience than anything. The weird acid-trip like camera shake still occurs, though thankfully less frequently, and it is like a bigger budget Saw. Think Land of the Dead. Still a Romero movie, but it didn't feel like one as much. Same thing applies here. The ending is cool for most people, but I honestly saw it coming. It gets a bit muddled, and by the end of it you really don't remember much except the very beginning and end. It's fun, and it's an interesting piece of this new Saw series, but it just doesn't seem to live up to the original for me. You watch it yourself and give it a chance. I give it a 6 1/2.",2006
7,"Last night we were part of the lucky few(750 peoples) who got to see the world premiere to the public of Saw II. Without going too much into the details, for this kind of movie can be ruined quite easily by revealing to much, I can say that it was a good sequel albeit not as strong as the first one. I could compare quite easily having seen the first one the night before.",2005
1,Nothing past the first 10 minutes of this movie should have happened. I'll sum it up quickly so you can get on with your life.,2005
10,"For me SAW was the best film of 2004 by far. It was unique and unlike any other horror or thriller before it. So being such a unique and amazing film i was very sceptical about going to see the sequel. ""How can it be as good as the first ??, its just going to ruin itself trying??"" They were the questions i was asking myself along with all my friends who also loved the first one. If you find that you've asked yourself these too, then don't worry :D It IS the BEST Film of 2005 for me so far. I'm writing this now after coming home from a staff screening, and i haven't been so excited after a film since .....probably ever.",2005
1,"The singular star should speak for itself...but to justify my vote would only be fair. First, the technical aspects of this ""film,"" which I liken to a bad NYPD Blue episode and a made for TV movie, are stunningly awful. Poor editing and poor cinematography make for an unintentionally distracted feel to the film, one that does not serve any purpose besides annoyance. Morever, the lighting simply didn't achieve the same effect it did in Saw, nor was it conducive to the tense atmosphere it hoped to engender. Secondly, the script and dialogue was painful to the point that I found myself cringing with each spoken word, rather than the acts of violence and display of gore. Now arises the question: With an improved script, would the acting improve? And the answer is: No. The acting was as awful, if not more so, than the script itself! It seemed to be truly made-for-TV quality. Finally, the plot, the horribly predictable plot... Each line (as if read from a teleprompter) can be predicted beforehand as can the opening scene and ending scene and every scene in between. Not once did I find myself with sweaty palms or a tight throat, simply because I knew everything that would happen, the entire 93 minutes (this should be a clue as to the production of the film). Fortunately, I went in with low expectations and I found entertainment in the absurdity of the entire production, accompanied by non-stop laughter.",2005
8,"This definitely has to be one of the best films of the year and is something that can be enjoyed by the whole family, from the wee tot to grandparents. Based upon the 'Nurse Matilda' books by Christianna Brand, the film revolves around seven motherless children who have frightened off seventeen nannies much to their over-wrought father's dismay. The children are unruly and their father has his own stresses of desperately searching for a wife before his mean-spirited great aunt cuts off his allowance and everything is falling apart at the seams...until Nanny McPhee enters the house to sort things out. Think of 'Mary Poppins' if Roald Dahl had written the character and you have an idea of what happens next!",2005
8,"I almost missed this one because I was turned off by the commercials and previews, with their emphasis on the silliest parts (the dancing donkey, etc.). What a mistake that would have been -- I'd have missed one of the driest, archest, loveliest scripts in years. Emma Thompson can do more with a slightly quirked eyebrow and a quiet ""Hm"" than most actresses can with an entire Shakespearean soliloquy. The whole cast, children and adults alike, is pretty near perfect, some of the best of the British theater even in the tiniest roles (Derek Jacobi, Imelda Staunton et al). The kids are tough and tart, without a simper in the lot, unlike most US child stars.",2006
10,"I took my almost-4-year-old and her two cousins (age 3 and 6) to see this and we all had a wonderful time! The cast was outstanding - Colin Firth marvelously befuddled, Angela Lansbury wonderfully austere, Emma Thompson gruesomely wise and endearing, and all of the children sweet and mischievous without being cloying and horrible. It was clever and never ""dumbed down"" as some movies peddled as family fare are these days. This film was both funny and touching. The scenery and costumes were also wonderful to look at -lovely use of color. Some reviews have said that the movie tries too hard to appeal to adults, but I disagree. If preschoolers can enjoy it, most children will. I highly recommend it to audiences of all ages.",2006
10,"I went to see this film today with my daughter, who is 31 and her 5 year old daughter and it's a long time since I saw such a truly wonderful film in the cinema.(and I go often)",2005
9,"Saw the film this morning at a Sunday Times preview and I'd like to think that more than a few of you will be eating your words when you see the finished product. It's beautifully put together, with lots of humour, the attractive Colin Firth and many superb performances. Celia Imrie creates a colourful character in Mrs Quickly, Imelda Staunton is fantastic as the cook (Mrs Blatherwick) and Angela Lansbury is expertly cast as Aunt Adelaide (despite the feathered dress making her look like a turkey!) As guessed at on another thread, Nanny McPhee does teach the children - that manners matter, you should be responsible for your actions, and that actions have consequences. It isn't dumbed down, there's certainly no 'dopey dialogue' - and there's also no annoying Americanisms as beset Charlie & the Chocolate Factory.",2005
9,"I took my children, ages 8 and 5, to see the movie over the weekend and I'd have to say that I enjoyed it every bit as much as they did. The character portrayed by Emma Thompson was simply wonderful. Even though she used her ""magic"" to get desired results from the children, all one had to do was look into her eyes and see the genuine compassion she felt for the children. The whole scenario with the fairy tale books and logic behind WHY the children misbehaved to much made them not nearly as bratty as one would have expected from such behavior and actually made me feel a bit sorry for them so they became almost likable in their attitudes. They weren't just ""brats"" for the sake of being brats; they had a genuine fear of losing their father which, ultimately would have happened had he married that harpie Mrs. Quimby.",2006
10,"This movie has a wonderful quality that would bring any distant family together. My children and I loved watching it together. It's nice to have a movie finally come out that everyone can enjoy. I highly recommend seeing it. Emma Thompson is so endearing. Colin Firth is such a lost soul trying to avoid everything and everyone around him. Angela Landsbury is so over the top, but very funny. Together they make such an interesting trio. The love, the comedy, the magic, and the unbelievable happy ending make it more than just a fairy tale, they make it a story that makes you wish that it was all happening to you. For children, it sets their minds imaginations into over-drive. It sends them to a place that lets their minds run free to believe in everything on the big screen in front of them. For just an adult, I would say, it would be less special, as apposed to an adult who has children to watch get engaged with this magical movie.",2006
9,"This was a pleasant surprise, much better than I anticipated. I figured Emma Thompson would be good in the title role because you can usually count on her to be entertaining in form or another, cerebrally, emotionally or comically. What I didn't figure on was the fun, extremely colorful story, overall. This was like a banana split for your senses - all kinds of wild treats for the eyes and ears.....to taste, so to speak.",2007
8,"Seven children, seventeen nannies. Poor dad Cedric Brown (Colin Firth) has all but given up. Suddenly, enter Nanny McPhee (Emma Thompson) using her magical powers (both emotionally and literally) to kick them into shape. Remind you of something? I'd be concerned if it didn't. But thankfully, as Nanny McPhee progresses, it twists and turns in such a pleasant fashion that by the end, you'll be wondering 'Mary who?' Adapted for the screen by Thompson herself, this is a fun and inventive kids film that is guaranteed to make you smile. Firth does his usually stuttering British man shtick, but given he has little to do, makes the most of it. Imedla Staunton, Angela Lansbury and Celia Imrie ham it up shamelessly and are loads of fun. But most of the attention should be directed towards Thompson, an ugly but constantly entertaining lead.",2005

9,"We saw it opening night and were blown away. I don't do spoilers so let me tell you about reactions. My girls are 8 and 12 and they were positively glued to the screen. I thought it a wonderful story and a great production too. The girls made me promise to buy the DVD when it comes out and we went straight to the book store to get the stories of Nurse Matilda that the movie was based on. Now, here is where the academy award comes in. I don't have the categories memorized but the team that was able to make such a wonderful screenplay out of such a lousy book surely deserves that award. It is rare when it happens but yes, the movie was a FAR sight better than the book. If you have kids or if you need to entertain your inner kid, go see this movie.",2006
9,What a breath of fresh air. I enjoyed Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events and this film's over-the-top storytelling reminded me of what I thought was lacking in that other film. There was much joy to be had. It really was a lot of fun and quite the breath of fresh air for children's movies since the slump between The Incredibles and now.,2006
10,"'Nanny McPhee' is a good movie in its own right, not merely as a kid's movie, or an art movie. Emma Thompson keeps on amazing us all with her screen writing (she is an Oscar winner for that, after all!), and her acting (ditto on the awards). Nanny McPhee is weird, to be sure--- but not just weird for weird's sake, such as a Tim Burton movie. Rather, the weirdness seems to take real life issues, and issues relating to parenting, and turn them around artistically into genuine entertainment.",2005

9,"This is an excellent family film with very little violence and questionable language. Our kids loved the film... and we did as well. Emma Thompson does a splendid job with giving depth to a character as Nanny McPhee. This movie could have gone wrong, but instead the movie was fun, with high energy and leaves you with a great moral lesson (especially to kids). Also, good to see a movie set in England with all English actors. The movie has the same feel as Mary Poppins, but with cinematography that matches todays standards. It is definitely worth to see in theatres. Word of advise: The fathers occupation in the film is a mortician. If your child is very sensitive to death I would recommend them not to see this film.",2006
2,"I bought this movie on DVD because my 6-year-old daughter was having a friend round for a sleepover and I thought it would keep them quiet for an hour or so before bedtime. However, when I showed our young guest my viewing choice for the evening, it was met with extreme indignation. For a peaceful life, I let them watch The Iron Giant instead (a superb film, by the way).",2008

10,"Saw Nanny McPhee this evening. Loved it! Emma Thompson did a great job on the screenplay and is great as the nanny. The scenes were colorful and it is refreshing to see a movie that actually teaches children good values! Thumbs up to this movie and I love Colin Firth and bravo to him for being in this. The children are endearing and the oldest boy was wonderful. It was great to see Angela Lansbury also - she was so good years ago in Bedknobs and Broomsticks. This is a great family movie and I hope this is the start of a series. I recommend this movie to young and old! We need more movies with values. In summary, I give this movie a 10 rating.",2006
10,"I must say that I love taking kids to see movies but majority of the time, the movies are over-wrought with violence and inappropriate behaviours for anyone under the age of 15! But this, Nanny McPhee, made me think differently. Emma Thompson is a wondrously talented woman and she proved it here again (along with Colin Firth, of course!) as she helped the distinctly intelligent yet naive Brown children turn their behaviours to the good. I saw several older ladies cry and many young children cheer throughout this extremely well done movie. Mary Poppins, watch out! This Nanny has got a few up on you! I implore all who are considering taking their child(ren) to this film to do so! It has many values that are lacking in films today. This movie might even make a child rethink his or her attitude towards their nannies! This is a movie we desperately needed! Good Show, Emma!",2006
10,"I was beginning to believe the only movies being made anymore were either sequels, remakes, or social commentaries. I am saved from that dark opinion by this absolutely lovely little movie. Great story, marvelous set direction, beautiful acting (especially from the children), Emma Thompson and Colin Firth. What more could you want from a film, you ask? Why how about Angela Lansbury and Derek Jacobi! And if that is not enough to get you into the theater how about a donkey in a flowered hat?? It's funny. It's sweet. It's tender. It's beautifully written and directed. The whole family absolutely loved it. We plan to see it again. See it with any and every child you know. See it if you don't know any children. Be prepared to be delighted.",2006

There were people in the audience who hadn't brought children with them, and they laughed louder than most, which proves that the film stands up in its own right - not just as a kids film. Emma Thompson gave a wonderful, under-stated performance - showing what true professionals are made of.",2005

He keeps hearing a disembodied voice telling him that ""The person you need is Nanny McPhee."" We presume that if he hires this otherworldly woman, the kids will learn proper behavior, and possibly he will learn proper parenting. It was at this point that I smiled. The setup seemed nearly perfect, promising a fun, quirky kid's movie.",2007

10,"Crisp and heartfelt thriller that gives you the right shot in the arm with an Oscar caliber performance by Rachel Weisz and an equally Oscar worthy performance by Ralph Fiennes. This is a film about the horrors of big business and the way they are willing to experiment on the poor to achieve their goals. Rachel Weisz plays Tessa, A feisty activist who uncovers a conspiracy by a pharmacy company to test experimental drugs on the poor natives of Africa.

Her husband, a quite diplomat then begins to take up her cause and try to give his departed wife justice while trying to uncover the hard truth of what is going on.",2005
1,"This is very competently made, but I think in the final analysis, fine performances, fine production design and fine cinematography count for little when a film is so wrapped up in its smug self-deception that it demeans the causes it affects to champion. Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes), a decent-hearted civil servant, falls in love with Tessa (Rachel Weisz), a political activist brimming with youthful righteousness. At the beginning of the film, Tessa weeps and rants about the decision to go to war with Iraq; we have the cliché of the ""over-emotional"" woman whose excess of feeling is supposed to chasten the buttoned-down conformity of the people around her. She says nothing of interest about Iraq. The subject of Iraq is a mere dramatic shorthand for any fashionable subject about which ""people like us"" hold the same opinion. Not two minutes later (of screen time at any rate!) our couple are shown having beautifully-photographed sex. Beautiful souls to beautiful bodies - how appropriate! How exquisitely civilized! I know an Iraqi guy who told me that in England, when people find out that he is Iraqi, they almost always apologise - ""I'm so, so sorry"". Why, he asked me, do they do that? Of course I replied that the majority of us in the UK opposed the war and we feel appalled by the misery that has ensued, and that the Labour government having been legitimately elected, we all feel in some way responsible for its policies. However, watching The Constant Gardener, a more sinister explanation presents itself. Perhaps those apologies to this random Iraqi are offered more as narcissistic tributes to the English person's sense of ethical superiority. Perhaps what they are saying is ""how beautiful I am that I care"". ",2010
10,"Intelligent and moving political thriller that should be held right up there with ""All The Presidents Men"" and ""The Killing Fields "" as one of the best political thrillers ever made. Fernando Meirelles tops his last directional effort with a thriller that is moving, scary and down right forthright in it's views of big companies gone wrong and the horrors that they are willing to inflect on others for the sake of profit. Rachel Weisz and Ralph Fiennes give career best performances in this film and that's a huge compliment considering the fact that they are good in almost everything they do, even in bad movies. Weisz is strong willed and obsessive and Fiennes is determine and endearing and both of them compliment each other with there destine to be award winning chemistry and acting chops. The director compliments both of them with a view of Africa that is rarely seen in film and a sense of reality that is only found in real life.",2005

7,"I thought the movie was great and worthy of the praise it has been getting from audiences and critics alike. Ralph Fiennes gives the performance of his career as a grieving man looking for answers and is slowing discovering the corruption all around him and Rachel Weisz steals the film whole heartily with a really deserving Oscar worthy performance as a human rights activist who will stop at nothing to get at the truth. The story is pretty scary and the cinematography is fantastic. Yes, the shaky camera can get in the way but it's not distracting enough to ruin the film.",2005
10,"It's been less than a day since I have seen it and I find it difficult to get it out of my mind. The images and feelings stay with you. The direction, cinematography and editing is superb. If you loved the style of ""City of God"" with its ""documentary style"" camera work then you'll love this too. The story is done ""non-linear"" like it was in the book.and I thought it made the experience of seeing the movie so much more enjoyable. Since the film starts off very early with the death of Tessa and then continues with Justin's journey of discovery to find out the cause of her death which only seems to bring even more heartache and anger.....the non-linear style allowed for some light hearted moments from Justin and Tessa's marriage to break up the tension.",2005
10,"Slow tension building thriller that is charge even more with the great performances of Rachel Weisz and Ralph Fiennes, who both bring an essence of realism to their roles and a sense of chemistry that is really not found in movies like this anymore. Rachel Weisz brings a ferry fury that is ripe in it's convictions and Ralph Fiennes brings a cool, collective zeal that is a slow building timer ready to emotionally exploded at any minute. Both performances compliment the fine directing of Fernando Meirelles, who gives this tale a sense of brilliance in its storytelling and a sense of the way the world really works. It's a heartfelt story of lost and redemption and it's hauntingly poetic in it's horrifying look at the horrors of a world that is willing to cast a blind eye at the problems of big business and corrupt governments that are willing to do anything in order to make a fast buck. Even going as far than to destroy human life to achieve their goals.",2005

1,"""Constant Gardener"" is a moderately skillful, utterly predictable piece of left-wing propaganda, masquerading as ""powerful drama"". It has a plot of sorts: ""Radical girl"" meets repressed, ""spineless boy"" who stupidly serves the establishment. She knows that the drug companies are evil and that in their mad pursuit of profits are conducting unethical and even lethal clinical tests on the African population. Naturally, anyone who threatens to expose the drug companies is simply ""offed"" by their army of hired thugs. After the drug companies murder ""radical girl"" for getting too close to the truth, ""spineless boy"" discovers that he has a backbone after all. No longer the timid, ineffectual man who escapes the world by pottering around in his garden, he fearlessly pursues his own investigation and digs up the necessary evidence, before he too is murdered.",2005
3,"The Constant Gardner is a conspiracy story set mostly in Kenya. The story starts near its end, as Justin Quayle sees his wife Tessa and Arnold Bluhm, her friend and associate, depart on a flight to the Kenyan outback. Shortly thereafter, Quayle is notified that Tessa and Arnold have died when their SUV overturns; ""foul play is suspected"" as they say. In his mind, Justin recalls events leading to Tessa' death to determine if she was murdered. We learn that Justin is a relatively clueless second generation British Foreign Service professional when he meets Tessa just a year earlier. Tessa, an outspoken activist, sees evil hiding behind corporations and government agencies; she quickly seduces, romances and marries Justin. Their transfer to Africa provides her with a fertile hunting ground. Tessa becomes involved with Arnold, a United Nations associate, working with Aids treatment programs. She immediately suspects the big pharmaceutical companies may be using unsuspecting natives for more than Aids research. Being what she is, Tessa starts turning over stones, writing reports and involving professional activists over the Internet; not good behavior for a Foreign Service wife. The entire British Foreign Service establishment is not asleep at the wheel; Sandy Woodrow the local representative and Sir Bernard in London take notice of Tessa's activity. Was her death in vain?

1,"Literally, nothing holds water here. Is this the same John le Carré who wrote some of the best plots ever? Forget about the pretentious narration (OK, we got He loved Her SOOOO MUCH after the second flashback...) and the shaky ""more real than real"" cinematography. But the story! Another universal conspiracy everybody's part of and no one knows about because all the good guys get murdered in a very complicated way. Two utterly obnoxious leads (the only lovable person in the movie is Bill Nighy's baddie, but there's not nearly enough of him) who behave like lunatics (Fiennes delaying the plane's take-off...). A VEDDY VEDDY important report of which one single copy is sent to the only guy who shall throw it into a shredder. A compromising letter which suddenly shows up in the middle of Africa, because no one thought of hiding it well. No Guardian's or NYT's reporter to be seen. A pharmaceutical firm killing people apparently for the sheer kick of it, because no other point could be guessed.",2007
1,"One of 2005 most disappointing films. Brazilian director Fernando Meirelles had made before the great gangster film ""Cidade do Deus"" about the brutal life in the slums of Rio de Janeiro. So expectations were high for his second film. Alas, he choose as its material a recent novel by John Le Carre, an exciting writer of spy novels in the 60s and 70s, but someone who has since the 90s been very disappointing in his work, turning the moral ambiguity of his earlier books into shrill indictments of the West in his later ones (not that he does not have a few points here and there in those books). So, from this unpromising material, Meirelles has made a truly awful movie. Basically, the plot is about a timid British diplomat (Ralph Fiennes) trying to solve the murder of his activist wife in Kenya (Rachel Weisz, playing an insufferably smug individual). Fiennes character eventually finds that she was on the track of evil western pharmaceutical companies testing new drugs on African patients without obtaining their fully informed consent - not Africa's most pressing issue. What is most disturbing about this movie, though, is that Africans are basically used as props, useful for the filmmakers to show their superior moral status over other whites. Africans are at most exotic objects here, not subjects of their own lives. You never get to hear their own voices in this film.",2006
1,Every 5th movie made in the last five years or so has been produced in this junk style of quasi-artistic film-making characterized by erratic photography and Cunard editing masquerading as tension and suspense in a screenplay that runs the risk of being discovered as devoid of plot if presented in sequence or photographed in an intelligible manner.,2006

10,"The murder of a diplomat's wife under mysterious circumstances is the crux of John LeCarre's complex political thriller THE CONSTANT GARDENER. While thematically, this type of story has been filmed before, it's not concerned so much as to who did it, or why (even though these elements remain as important as ever throughout the plot), but the gradual revelation of a woman whose story is told after her death through flashbacks, pieces of previous conversations, and recollections.",2006
10,"A really great adaptation of Le Carre's book, the film is taught and filled with excellent performances. A love story told from a unique perspective, the plot extends through corruption, murder and how international corporations influence government and value peoples' lives by the currency of their relative media value.",2005
9,"A beautiful young woman, Tessa Quayle, with a scintillating and irresistible personality, dazzling intellect, unflinching courage, and undaunted dedication to fighting a vast conspiracy between cross-national governments and a collusion of pharmaceutical companies to exploit impoverished Africans for multi-billion-dollar profits sets the stage for an absolutely compelling cinematic drama. An endearingly descent but insignificant UK diplomat to Africa, Justin Quayle, is the thread used to interweave this amazingly complex tapestry of global crime composed of compromised spies, corrupt bureaucrats, high-level corporate wheeler-dealers and their operatives, research scientists, and even doctors. With such a vast collection of conspirators, it is impossible to detect those ultimately responsible for their exploitation the destitute AIDS patients in Africa. If they do not eliminate the casualties from their experimental drug, their claims for their miracle drug would be undermined. 'They' use long, loosely connected, chains leading down to small-time, obscure hit men to remove anyone who becomes 'a problem', meaning who might expose them. While this is the story's underlying plot it is also its raison d'être. The vast, lofty, impenetrable, world of secret connections and villainous transactions within the shadowy official corridors and exclusive club salons of the untouchable rich and powerful elite confounds attempts at comprehension. Just as confounding, is the virtual miracle of compressing all of these diverse elements into a single plot while blending them with an eye-moistening romance by the expert triumvirate of LeClare, Meirelles, and Caine. While the camera work is a 'stopper', as a spy story, it is a masterpiece. It is also the artists' clarion call to a sleeping world naively putting their trust in those steering the fate of the world.",2005
10,"Passionate, Intense and moving political thriller that not only fulfills it duties perfectly as a great and passionate film. Ralph Fiennes is at his best with a performance that should once and for all show people on how versatile he really is with a somber performance that is a study of how human expression can tell one' feelings and one's actions. To just look at this man act is a gift in itself and he is at his best here. While Fiennes is at his best, he is outdone by the powerful and graceful performance of Rachel Weisz, which makes this film as powerful and as haunting as it is. She brings a sense of playfulness, mystery and strong will that has not been giving by an actress in the last few years. Her character is wrap in mystery and is only remembered in flashbacks but while you are trying to piece together the truth, you still will morn for her character in the way Justin does for her and be outrage by the circumstances that is responsible for her death. The cinematography is amazing and the direction by Fernando Meirelles is just as inspiring. He lets the actors become the characters and it flows like a running steam of fresh water that is refreshing as well as uplifting.",2006

7,I was a bit hesitant about seeing the film because of the low ratings.,2006
9,"I'm surprised to see some low ratings for this movie because I found it to be really good. I didn't find a boring moment thru out the whole movie and the ending was so twisted... it just brought everything together. I wasn't sure of what the movie was about so I was definitely caught off guard with the whole plot. It sort of starts out like a love story, then next thing you know the guns come flying. Its different from any other movie I've seen with realistic outcomes and life situations. At times I wasn't sure if I was on the good guy's or bad guy's side because in a way, the main character deserved some of what he got. And I also understood why the bad guys chose their targets without remorse. If I wasn't given a background of the main character, I don't think i would've felt bad for him. Anyway, its a good movie and I'd definitely recommend checking it out.",2006
9,"I was avoiding the film because of the lower ratings it had received but after several recommendations, I went and saw it and was surprisingly pleased with the whole film from start to finish. In my opinion, this could be very well one of the best thrillers of the year. The trailer for it really doesn't do it justice for what the movie really is; a dark, suspenseful, edge of your seat thriller. Jennifer Aniston does a great job breaking out of her Friends character that everyone associates her with and that so few sitcom actors have been able to do. Don't wait for this one to come out on DVD. You definitely want to catch this one in the theater.",2005

Yep, stabs him in prison with a shank, y'know, so he could easily get through the metal detector. This movie is complete with the sick daughter with type 1 diabetes, to add extra drama...it doesn't work. The poor wife who has managed to keep her marriage together despite the sick child, even though she and the husband don't have sex anymore. Such a waste of time, and I really hope Ms. Aniston sticks with comedy, she's so much better than this.",2006
2,"An advertising executive flirts with a financial adviser on the morning train in Chicago; both are married, but they end up at a hotel anyway where their tryst is interrupted by a gun-toting, assaultive thug who steals their belongings. Blackmail thriller in which Clive Owen, channeling Nicolas Cage, plays such a naive chump that one doesn't watch the movie for the plot twists or the human drama, but just to see when and if this guy is going to wake up and start reacting. How much the viewer enjoys the film depends solely upon their patience-factor. When the 'surprises' in the script finally come, they're too late; Owen has already been beaten to a pulp, had his crotch assaulted in his own home while his wife is doing the dishes, and forced to pay a prostitute by crooked cops (this film really makes Chicago look disgusting). Stuart Beattie adapted his screenplay from James Siegel's book, but which one is to blame for making the leading character such a doormat? Or for filling the picture with an assortment of sour supporting characters, each one more of a jerk than the next? * from ****",2008
1,"I paid to watch this film on sky box office last night. I am just glad I didn't pay to go to the cinema to watch it. Absolute rubbish. Started off OK, but as soon as it progressed into the main story, I didn't know whether to laugh at the ridiculously stupid plot or turn off in frustration. I kept watching. I wish I hadn't. Thillers often do get a little far fetched and people do desperate things, but if the point of him paying the money over was to stop his wife finding out about the affair, how on earth was he ever going to explain the loss of all that money to his wife - and then he went and told her anyway! And to throw a sick child into the mix to try and make it a bit more emotional was just pathetic. Good cast, rubbish plot.",2006

4,"It starts so promisingly that thoughts of ""Fatal Attraction"" even ""Brief Encounter"" came to mind but, unfortunately, it degenerates into a rushed, thoughtless TV movie of the week. I can put up with nonsense and suspend my disbelief like the next guy but you have to have all the other elements in place for me to buy whatever it is you're selling. Here the script gives up a wallop just a the right time and then pretends to have accomplished its mission when the wallop should be the beginning of the mission. Clive Owen is a phenomenal actor a true film creature at a pair with the greatest and the best, although I think he is overdoing it a bit. He's everywhere. No, Mr Owen, less is more. Vincent Cassel is terrifying, brilliantly so. Pity that the script doesn't allow him to become a real character and Jennifer Aniston, what can I say? Whenever I mention she's not made for the big screen, her defenders always shout: ""Have you seen The Good Girl?"" Well, yes, I have and I was fooled like everyone else. She's not in tune with the medium, her performances are just that, performances and not particularly good. Did you see ""Rumor Has It""? She's too much of a personality and not enough of an actress. We'll be seeing re runs of Friend for years to come. I think that will remain the Jennifer Aniston that everyone knows and likes.",2006
9,"Great movie, Clive Owen was brilliant and its a good change for Jennifer, pure fast paced entertainment, just what it was meant to be! I hope Jennifer does a lot more movies like this to get rid of the good girl type cast. I really liked RZA, his acting was great and his character was believable and very funny. The movie was fast and edge of the seat almost from the start. I found some parts predictable but that didn't ruin the movie for me. Some of the things that I predicted happened, but not when and how, so it still keeps you guessing. I buy a lot of DVD's and this movie is going on my list of movies to buy for sure. I definitely recommend this movie.",2005
2,"First, if the script and movie are factual to the book, who published that piece of junk? Are you kidding me? Yes, I knew Jennifer Aniston was a crook from the get go. The crook always fronts you a few bucks to make you think they're good people. Second, they both could have gone to the police and asked that their spouses not be told. It happens all the time. The mere fact that she wouldn't even go to the police and talk to them...she didn't have to file the report...that made me suspicious. At the point he was conned for $20K, why didn't he get a policeman to follow him, or get a wire? Nobody would be so stupid. I tell you, this has got to be Jennifer Aniston's best comedy yet. Hard to believe that Hollywood thinks this garbage is worthy of a budget. I've seen more compelling porn in my life. If I wrote this piece of crap, I would change my name. In fact, I'll issue a challenge to every studio head, producer out there: I can write a better thriller than this in 1 month's time. This is about as compelling as IMDb's threat to add you to a blacklist if you don't point out spoilers...OHHHHH I'm scared...",2010

And instead of reporting it to the police and notifying their spouses, they don't do anything. Then the thief comes back and blacks mail them. They pay and don't tell anyone. So the thief blackmails them for more. Then the thief kills a friend and still he tells no one. He keeps digging himself deeper and deeper with no plan for escape. How much more of a wuss and idiot can a person be? To enjoy a movie, you need to relate to or care for at least one of the characters. Since the main characters are completely unsympathetic, I shut it off half way thru and took it back to the rental store. Save your money, don't watch it.",2006
1,"This movie was hands down on the worst movies, I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot. This movie's plot was so pointless and contrived. Here it is in a nutshell, Clive Owen Jennifer Aniston are two strangers who meet on a train and they soon develop feelings for each other, but the problem is they are both married. As they go into a hotel room, a stranger breaks in, beats up Clive Owen and rapes Jennifer Aniston. Well after that, Jennifer Aniston doesn't want to call the police because if they did, her husband who divorce her and take her child. Soon, the stranger starts demanding money from Clive Owen or he'll tell his wife what has happened or hurt Jennifer Aniston. The problem is you never feel bad for Clive Owen in this movie, because he's cheating on his wife with Jennifer Aniston. Clive Owen and his wife also have a very sick child. So when the man embezzling money from Owen, Owen has to take the money from his bank account, which they were saving for their child's medical bills. Clive Owen has numerous chances to get the police involved but never does. Why not? Just another plot hole in this movie. This movie insults your intelligence. Don't waste your time.",2006
7,"Don't miss ""Derailed"". It is far from a big production, yet its twists and turmoil grip the spectator and force him to highly concentrate and attach to the movie's agitated rhythm. The Neanderthal chemistry between the couple of Owen and Anniston, translates to off screen, giving a satisfactory acting result, although individually many faults can be advised. Vincent Cassel plays the thief with a chilling magnitude.""The book manipulates the reader so he cannot advise what is coming next"", says Owen's character to her daughter, while analyzing a book together, as a hidden preface. Mikael Häfstrøm (who is quite unknown) cuts into the Hollywood formula and plays with the character psychological aspects while dipping and destroying their life's with certain Hitchcock reminiscences- Don't be confused; this thriller follows the book of Hollywood and has it's own particularities. Now, if you like fast, exciting rides where you remain in the dark and eager to know, this movie is for you. Otherwise, if you like intellectual films; maybe you won't pack to ""rail in"" to this movie.",2007
3,"Jennifer Aniston remains her Friends character here; she is just behaving in some difficult to understand ways. Why would this smart, classy, charming character consort with a killer who comes up with the sleaziest, most dangerous shakedown scam possible? Love? Pretty hard to believe. But no other clues or explanations are provided. And why do the two criminal masterminds do such a poor job of hiding their tracks? They continue using the same locations to conduct their shakedowns. Further, the shakedowns rely on some pretty risky assumptions: a) that they will be able to knock-out but not kill or seriously debilitate the victim; b) that the victim will not fight to the death; c) that the victim will not do something to attract the attention of others, e.g., yell out the window; and d) most preposterously, the victim will not go to the police on his own. Movies of this type often rely on such shaky leaps, but here it is just too much. Clive Owen's character would rather jeopardize the life of his daughter (the payoff money was earmarked for her medical care) and cover up the murder of his friend just so that Jennifer Aniston's character doesn't have to face the possibility of divorce. No way. Meanwhile, Jennifer Aniston's character has no protection other than these assumptions. Once the scam has started, she has to sit at an office, pretending to be someone she is not, and where the victim knows where to find her, for days, even weeks. She must have spent every day sweating. When the victim came to see her, it would only have taken one co-worker to call her by her real name, and the scam would have been up. And if the victim had had the good sense to go to the police, Aniston would have been a sitting duck. Really a poorly put together scam, resulting in a rather disappointing movie.",2006

This makes the show so unrealistic, and boring. The plots are pointless, and incredibly boring. The actors are so bad, it makes me want to take my own life. I really hate the fact that in the show, Zoey is the most popular girl in school, and the prettiest, and smartest, and gets the best grades without doing any work. She never has any real problems, and every guy wants to date her. She is so perfect. There isn't anyone like that. Also, I hate that everyone would do anything for her, and everyone picks her for every team, or club. It is so annoying. Quinn is so obnoxious. Her experiments are pathetic, pointless, and fake. Chase is such a wimp. He says he loves Zoey, but if he told her, it would ruin their friendship. How pathetic. Michael tries to be funny, but he never accomplishes anything. Nichole is so perky, and screams a lot. She is never seen doing any work, or studying, but she is a straight A student. Lola thinks she is an actress, but she sucks (Excuse my language).

She is always perfect at everything including her perfect figure. And she is such a dietetic freak she talks about carbs like she knows what they are. When she sees that her friends are eating chocolate she confiscates it. And another thing that ticks me off is that she is always chewing a piece of spearmint every time you look at her. And everyone wants something do with her, for example in one episode that Logan guy bid $4,000 to have her and her friends cheer for everything he does in his pathetic life. And her friend Nicole is an overly perky freak that screams a lot.And Lola dresses like a hoochie Houdini lady. 80s called they want there bushy hair back.Might as well shave off the hair chase.

Every episode shows Zoey as the girl that every girl wants to be her best friend and that every boy wants to date. She's always perfect and no one is like that in real life. How can people relate to a character that is just a Barbie doll? Jamie Lynn's acting is fair but she is not a strong enough actress to have the lead role in a series. All the show's fans are just young girls who don't know any better.

The characters are unbelievable and mismatched. You have your typical popular girl. A peppy, shallow, stupid ,stereotypical, girl who is portrayed by a horrible actress. Then you have a typical jock guy who is somewhat normal and actually nice.Then the stereotyped smart girl who is a freak and obviously does not fit in with the perfect popular friends of hers.

Examples, High School Musical 1 and two, Hannah Montana ex cetera, so just strap yourself in and enjoy the ride. The last of shows seem to have a lack of focus.

Zoey Brooks is portrayed by Jamie Lynn Spears, the self proclaimed actress who got her claim to fame by being the younger sister of the international pop star Britney Spears. With her lovely blond wig in the first season and an attempt at hiding her monotonous country accent, it's confirmed that Nickelodeon has indeed gone to the dogs with nepotism. When Kristin Herrera, the actress who portrayed Dana Cruz in the first season, left the show, all hope vanquished as she was the only decent actress. The female casting is a complete disgrace but the male casting has potential for a teenage media. If they continue to pursue Jamie Lynn Spears as the picture of perfection, very many people will have to lower their standards. With hope, they will soon find that you can't make a career out of nothing. Jamie Lynn Spears is useless for acting, singing and anything else she attempts for that downward spiral she calls a career. There is no wondering why she is a self-proclaimed actress.

Because the subplots are more about the other characters on the show, rather than the queen bee Zoey (Jamie-Lynn). Let's face it- Miss Spears cannot act. The only reason that she is the lead is because of her celebrity connections, not her acting ability. It's really a shame because some of the more supporting characters on the show are my favorites. For example, the characters of Quinn and Logan are very much underused, and it's a shame. Therefore, I would've given this show a three if it weren't for the great supporting cast that are just waiting in Ms.Spears' shadow.",2007

1,"I strongly dislike this show. I mean, like, basically everyone at that school is perfect, and rich, and I doubt a boarding school would look as cool as that. And why do they suddenly allow girls into the school? Isn't that just a little weird? anyways, Jamie Lynn spears CANNOT act. She always has the same facial expression, which really annoys me. She is basically emotionless, and all the guys seem to like her.",2007
4,"I've seen this programme a few times and the more a see of it, the less I like it. Jamie Lynn Spears was approached to do this because of the fact that she is Britney's sister and I'm sorry to say that that in the show is obvious. They've created the character Zoey to be everything people want to believe Jamie Lynn is, clever, original, smart, pretty, popular etc. The characters around her are only there to make her look better, by being smarter then them, more popular than them, more wanted by boys then them. There is nothing original about this and it's poured with money, so every kid there has the coolest of fashions and stuff. I also have to say, for a 13 year old girl (or however old she is, can't be much older) she wears very mature clothing, those short skirts are too short, it makes young people want to wear them, and all that make-up, this adds to the rising problems of why young girls get into so much trouble. The only thing I will say is that the opening credits are sung by Jamie Lynn and, given her age, isn't bad at all, much better than her sister anyway when it comes to vocal ability. Sorry, it's too mature and yet too dumbed down. It's poorly acted with predictable story lines and there is far too much stereotyping going on too.",2006
8,"There are quite a few nice things about this film. In particular, Zathura is an aesthetically intelligent film. The makers did a great job of not relying too heavily on CGI; very thoughtful design and effects. The convincing use of miniatures, real sets and chaos/destruction really brought the story to life. True, its a kids movie. But not so much that it annoys, there's a timeless and attractive notion of adventure. Really hearkens back to the glory of 80's kids adventure movies. The film's gadgets and knick-knacks were great. The house and Zathura game-board were both characters in and of themselves, every bit as important as the actors (who did a fine job). ",2006
8,"It is rare when a movie transports me back to my childhood memories, reminding me of the time when playing games use to be fun. Adventures were limited by imagination, and Summer days were transformed into magic.

10,"Probably one of the best family movies I've ever seen. Lots of good clean fun, maybe a little bit scary for the youngest viewers, but not too scary for school age (I think). I intend to recommend it to my sister for her kids. I'm a big fan of Chris Van Allsburg's books. I enjoyed Polar Express a lot, but I loved Zathura. Definitely the best movie from his books to date. Almost as interesting as the movie itself was the making of the movie information from the DVD. I thought Josh was adorable, particularly how much he loved his stunts. I heartily recommend this movie. I watched it on a loan, now it's on my wish-list. Definitely a keeper for me!",2006
6,"Those who criticize ""Zathura"" for being a copycat ""Jumanji"" are apparently clueless about the Van Allsburg's books. ""Zathura"" is a sequel to ""Jumanji"", it is about what happened when the Budwing brothers opened the game box that Peter and Judy discarded at the end of ""Jumanji"". Early board games were often designed with two-sided boards so that the game pieces could be used to play two different games-usually of the same type. ""Zathura"" was the flip side of the ""Jumanji"" game board and the ones the brothers chose to play (because Walter did not like jungle games). So it is ""supposed"" to be like another ""Jumanji"".",2006
10,"If you're watching this show looking for science fiction, don't bother. This is a story in the grand old Buck Rogers vein. It's for KIDS. i never watched the show as a critical adult trying to find flaws in it or worrying about suspension-of-belief. i watched it as i used to when i was a kid, going to a Saturday afternoon matinée. Excited, thrilled at being in the theater... popcorn and pop in hand. Fidgeting in the seat until the lights dimmed. Then the anticipation... ready to enter into the story. i wasn't disappointed. The movie captured my imagination from start to finish. My advice; this is for kids only. If you're a grown-up, leave your adulthood at the door. If you enter into it as a kid you'll experience the wonder, the suspense, the thrills, the chills. ",2006
10,"It's not often a ""kids movie"" will keep me entertained right through by Zathura did just that. The actors are excellent, there are plot twists, and it's just good old fashioned fun as well. I was pleasantly surprised when watching this movie and at the end I wished it had been longer. Jonah Bobo and Josh Hutcherson work extremely well together as the two lead characters and with special effects that are realistic (as realistic as a fantasy film can get anyway) the end result is an excellent movie for all ages. Jumanji was good but Zathura is great and I can highly recommend it to everybody. Take your kids to see it, take your parents to see it - take everyone to see it.",2006
10,This movie was surprised me. The only reason I went to see it was my boys ages 8-15 begged me. This film mirrored my boys. It was like watching them in action. For the first time they could see themselves in living color. They could see how horrible they treat each other. This film taught my boys a lesson they will not soon forget.,2006
9,This is a very straight forward flick with great action sequences and great chemistry with the actors. Though some parts might be a little scary for some kid's the movie is never violent and no one ever get's hurt. There's a good dose of fun and it's engaging for adults also. Zathura is a rare film in that it's demographic isn't global in scope. I'm not sure how it would go over with young girls but I saw it with my brother and his kids (my nephew's) and we all were entertained. The special effects are not over the top and are well done. The pace is predictable but the scenes are not. Great movie for anyone with a good theater system. Fun movie for both kids and adults.,2006

2,"""Jumanji in space"". That's the line on this little stinker. Don't believe it. Much more like ""Annoying Children in Space"". If it tickles you to watch really annoying brats in odd situations then this is a dream movie for you. As I watched the movie on CD I was so uncomfortable that I figured it must have bombed like crazy in the theaters, and that based on how much it must have cost to make I also figured the director never got a big budget movie to screw with again. I was right about the bomb! I was right about the budget! And...the director goes on to make mega budget, mega successful Iron Man. Only in Hollywood. What ever success there is in the future for director Favreau, this frustratingly annoying, whiny, nonsensical mess is an unfortunate stain on his resume.",2008
10,I went into Zathura expecting a bunch of crap but wow was i ever surprised.This movie is sooo cool it's scary.Being a 16 year old girl I only went to see this movie because my nephews wanted to see it and I ended up having more fun then they did.Zathura is a very different adventure film from the creator of the snore fest Jumanji.Unlike Jumanji this is much more fun and charismatic and is much easier to follow.Zathura is one of those family films that will turn out to be a classic like The Sandlot because it's just about the most entertainment a kid can get out of a movie.It is meant to be fun and wacky and successfully delivers what it set out to do.Zathura is a fun filled adventure for the whole family.So get to the theatre and enjoy Zathura 10 outta 10 all the way.,2005
5,"After a long day of listening to my boys fighting, I decided we all needed to get out of the house and see a movie. I corralled my husband, my daughter and both of my sons into the car. I painstakingly made sure that my daughter sat between the two boys so that they could not kill each other on the drive to the theater. Sure enough, the drive consisted of them reaching across their sister's lap to pinch and poke each other. By the time we reached the theater, all I could think about was how great it was going to be to quietly watch a movie for two hours ",2005
9,"Let's face it: ""Zathura"" is basically a carbon copy of ""Jumanji"", with the former based in space and the latter based in the jungle. Both involve children playing a seemingly innocuous board game that shockingly comes to life, with the players needing to finish the game in order to survive.",2006
9,"I've always had a certain affection for Jumanji. Granted the plot is on the slight side and it's carried by a barrage of special effects, but it still entertains, and its a lively romp. 10 years have passed, and we now have an almost unofficial sequel, with the same basic premise, but more fleshed out characters, and the action taking place this time in outer space. That film is Zathura.",2006
2,"Unlike Jumanji, this is NOT for anyone smarter than a 5th grader. They use typical kid shortcomings instead of writing a clever script. Much of the story didn't make sense or was simply unbelievable. They seem to just make stuff up to fit what they wanted - some things floated in space including the sputum and the astronaut, but the kids were totally unaffected by 0 gravity. The guy stuck in the game, the Zorgons we never see, the robot repairing itself forever, all seemed like lazy writing and directing. The youngest kid screws up constantly and says I'm sorry at least 40 times. I was so sick of this needy, whiny child that I didn't care if they made it home or not. I'm sure there are parents who don't know how to discipline their kids so some will find this believable. Those who feel parents should address rude and co-dependent behavior early, will lose patience with this mess of a movie driven by redundant bad behavior.",2008
3,"Wow, this film just wasn't very good. Nothing wrong with the visual aspect, that I noticed, and the basic premise seems to be a sound one, but its execution and just about everything else about this movie stunk. You probably know the premise (JUMANJI in space), so no need for me to go over it. ",2010
2,"Okay so I decided to sit down and watch this because... It was on TV and MirrorMask would play next. When I did sit down to watch it what I got was probably one of the dumbest family films I've ever seen (I say ""one of the"" because the animated Titanic movies exist).",2014
3,"This movie will appeal to the six year olds...and hopefully not to much older.... It was simply a terrible piece of work that went downhill from the opening. If you liked Jimunji, then just watch it again rather than ruin your self with this dreadful film. There is no decent exchange between characters...the set is BORING! Some of the writing for this was so trite and contrived that I thought I would gag!! I was very glad to have it end and even happier to return it ...the same day! The two young actors were poorly directed as well. Tim Robbins is in this for the first five minutes and about the last five minutes....I'm sure he got a decent paycheck but his acting looked flat and as ridiculous as the rest of this thing. If you enjoy watching two young brothers shouting at each other over and over and over again then this may be for you!!",2006
7,"""Zathura"" is a science-fiction movie directed by Jon Favreau, and based on a book by Chris Van Allsburg. ""Zathura"" is similar to ""Jumanji,"" which is also based on the work of Van Allsburg. In this story, two quarreling brothers discover an old board game in the basement, which launches their house into outer space. This movie does not quite have the scope of ""Jumanji,"" but it is still enjoyable. There is a lot of excitement, and the visuals are well done. The movie has a good retro science-fiction look. The story is adequate, teaching some lessons as it goes. At times, though, it might seam preachy. In the end, ""Zathura"" is still worth watching.",2005
1,"From the previews I thought ""Zathura"" would be a kid-friendly, fun space adventure. What I got was two foul mouthed kids and the feeling that someone was trying to provide a cheap therapy session for adults whose parents divorced when they were children. I think divorce is terrible and certainly at an alarming rate in this country, but this movie is not marketed as that and the subject matter seemed to come way out of left field.",2005
3,"Having seen Jumanji (and having loved it) way back in the day, I was naturally both intrigued and excited about Zathura. The same basic concept (the magical board game) with an entirely different twist. I was excited when I saw the previews and after hearing that the movie didn't rely entirely on CG, as is the case with many films nowadays.",2005
6,"In 'Zathura' Jonah Bobo plays Danny, a kid who is being ignored. He just wants some attention but his older brother (Josh Hutcherson) does not want to play with him, his dad (Tim Robbins) is too busy, and his sister (Kristen Stewart) has other things to do. But once he finds a board game called 'Zathura' down in the basement, his family starts to take notice.",2005

9,"What a throughly engrossing evening Woody Allen has provided. This film has been, by and large, poorly received by the British critics. I cannot understand why. Yes, it does have the strongest echoes of Crimes and Misdemeanours, but if a director/writer can't borrow from his own product, who can? This isn't funny Allen -- there are few laughs -- but it is an extremely intense and successful serious Allen.",2006
9,"Match Point is a cool, classically elegant and concise film that addresses all of the big questions--love, morality, death, fate, chance--without ever seeming heavy or self-conscious. I've never seen a Woody Allen film to match it. As a matter of fact, I can't remember another film of late that I thought was quite this good. From the opening shot, the film draws you in and doesn't let up, moving from shot to shot with a fine sense of rhythm and a narrative drive that builds the viewer's curiosity through a series of unexpected switchbacks. Rhys-Meyers is superb as an ex- professional tennis player from a poor Irish background who has turned social climber. Too proud to accept a favor from his upper class friends without immediately offering to pay it back, he affects an interest in opera and Strindberg. The viewer at once sympathizes with him and winces as he strains to seem refined and self-assured. Allen has put together a superb cast of young actors who bring his near flawless script to life so convincingly that one almost immediately suspends disbelief and becomes absorbed in the story. The shots of London are luxuriant and spacious, never self-indulgent. Few films, novels, or plays manage to form such rich dramatic material out of characters' inner obstacles. A classic piece of drama that reaches toward the likes of Shakespeare and Dostoevksy, every facet--from structure to dialog to editing to sound--is brought off with panache. This is not only Allen at his best but an example of what the cinematic medium is capable of when properly exploited.",2006
10,"Would it that this film had been made in the Forties or Fifties when film-noir was at its high point! Woody Allen, one of America's best directors pays his homage to the genre in his latest film about romantic obsession, and if his name weren't in the opening credits you wouldn't know he directed it. Taking a break from filming in the city he loves the most, deleting every trace of the well known neurotic hoots and clicks from his main and supporting British cast, and even removing the trademark reference to his own persona from Jonathan Rhys-Meyers' performance, MATCH POINT becomes a very European film that starts out deceptively as a character study with comedic tones and ever so subtle moves into the darker side of love, echoing THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE and of all films, FATAL ATTRACTION.",2006
8,"In ""Match Point,"" Woody Allen, caught in one of his more ""serious"" moods, takes a simple tale about marital infidelity and turns it into something complex and fascinating. Although he leaves a trail of clues implying that this is to be another of his homages to Fyodor Dostoevsky, the film really turns out to be Allen's own version of Theodore Dreiser's ""An American Tragedy"" (albeit set in England, perhaps to throw us off the scent). The parallels between the two works are not perfect, of course - in fact they often seem to be intentionally inverted - but they are close enough to make us wonder if Allen did, indeed, do it all on purpose.",2006
9,"...and what a great stroke of luck it is to have sat through Woody Allen's latest, ""Match Point."" Fans of Woody could sense his comeback in the tragedy half of his last effort, ""Melinda and Melinda."" It was far more compelling than the comedy half, and the philosophical ideas it brought up were the best Woody Allen had given us in a long while. Here with ""Match Point"" he explores the notion of luck and gives us his best film since....well, since I don't know when. He proves here that when he leaves himself out of the cast, and changes locations (the transition from New York City to London is as flawless as it is invigorating), he can deliver the goods. This film, free of all the typical Allen shtick, and full of noirish twists and surprises, is every bit as good as Robert Altman's ""The Player"" or ""Gosford Park,"" and like those two films, it's the best kind of return to form you could hope for from a past master.",2006
10,"The best Woody Allen movie in about 15 years. I would've said that a couple of months back about 'Melinda and Melinda' but this is a far better cry than Melinda and Melinda. Don't get me wrong, I think Melinda and Melinda is a good movie, but 'Match' is more fulfilling.",2006
10,"It's been said, but for a while one of the best filmmakers of the 20th century has been staggering with mediocre films not nearly up to his potential. But finally Allen has returned to the game with a subtle but perfectly done thriller which allows him to reinvent himself and discover new terrain like a brand new filmmaker.",2006
10,"I was lucky enough to see this film at the Cannes Film Festival recently where it screened out of competition. Being a Woody Allen fan, I was just hoping the film would be OK and not a disaster like some of his most recent films. Boy, was I surprised! MATCH POINT is easily his best film since CRIMES AND MISDEMEANOURS and once of his best ever. In his first foray out of Manhattan and into London, you would have thought he had lived there all his life. This film is a masterpiece and is a sure bet to win critical acclaim and many awards. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is a revelation and finally lands a role of a lifetime as a young man who enters the world of the wealthy elite and would do anything to stay there. Scarlett Johansson has never looked as sultry and sexy as she does here playing the cool femme fatale. The film is beautifully structured and the performances by all and sundry are exemplary. Emily Mortimer and Brian Cox stand out among the supporting cast. The film has so many layers and so many unexpected twists that this is obviously the work of a genius director in full flight.",2005
10,"Match Point is my favorite American-directed film of 2005. Woody Allen, coming off of hitting his stride again with Melinda and Melinda, goes back to his darker, dramatic side, and makes a story that may seem a little familiar, though not to his discredit. Woody borrows (some may say steal) elements from Fyodor Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment, one of the great novels of the 19th century (some may say ever written, I have read his work though not this yet), and transfuses it with subject matter that he's more than well acquainted with- the relationship drama. But un-like Love and Death, which was Allen's way of parodying the work of the author, this time he takes the work seriously, plunging the audience into the mind, conflicts, and outcome of the protagonist. That the performances by the actors involved, particularly the three main leads are top notch (Jonathan Rhys-Myers, Emily Mortimer, and Scarlett Johnasson in one of her best) brings full blood and flesh to Woody's strong skeleton of a film.",2006

10,"A Noir with English accents. A modern, ancient tale with super stars of the future and a score of crackling vinyl original recordings of timeless arias. A sixtysomething filmmaker with the flair of an impertinent newcomer. A masterpiece. Engrossing, entertaining, elegant, wicked. The meeting between the splendorous Scarlett Johanssen and the breathtaking Jonathan Rhys-Meyers at the ping pong table is right out ""A Place In The Sun"" - Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift at the pool table - the feeling is James Cain and Patricia Highsmith but the result is unique, bold, enthralling. Allen's British dialogues are refreshingly startling and I don't intend to spoil the pleasure of its perverse surprises by hinting at any of them. Just let me say that if you love cinema, rush to see it.",2005
6,"One of Woody Allen's most polarizing films, so far as I can tell, there seems to be very little neutral feeling on Match Point: viewers either hail it as a late-career gem, or deride it as an absolutely miscast, poorly-scripted farce. It's neither, really; what the film demonstrates best is that anything 'new' in Woody Allen films is essentially the Emperor's new clothes.",2009
1,"I too am a great Woody Allen fan, and was very nervous about seeing his attempt at a 'serious' work. I'd read mixed reviews like everyone, and went fairly open-minded. After seeing this film I can not understand how it could garner a single positive review. Featuring the worst central performance I've seen in a long time (Rhys-Meyers) who gave his most wooden performance yet (and that really is saying something). A pretty boy and nothing more. The plot was bizarrely simple and well-worn, one-dimensional and utterly unengaging. Scarlett Johansson, bless her, tries but just looks ridiculous bringing such over top sultriness - the first time we see her, lighting a cigarette and giving the camera a Look made me laugh out loud. Completely devoid of humour, Allen has made a film about English Upper Class that he obviously knows nothing about. Attempts at intriguing themes of luck etc fall flat on their face with a big thud. For God's sake, don't encourage him to make more of this kind of cinema.",2006
1,"Well. And what a waste of 8 euros ""Match Point"" turned out to be. As it happens, Woody Allen couldn't get financing in the US, or at least without strings attached, so he's decided to go and milk the BBC instead. Which means, in effect, that he recycled a story he'd written for a New York setting straight into a London setting, without any attempt at any significant rewrite. And ""written"" is a loose term. ""An American Tragedy"" meets ""A Place In The Sun"" meets ""Room at the Top"" meets ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" meets (but let's not get carried away) ""Le Rouge et le Noir."" Ambitious poor boy courts aristocratic rich girl then gets torn between rich in-laws and poor girlfriend from the wrong side of the tracks. If you think this is too generic a summary, that's the whole point: ""Match Point"" is nothing but generic.",2005
4,"The first part of 'Match Point', about the drift of the hero into a passionate but adulterous affair, is pretty good. But even in these scenes there are problems. For example, there is a love making scene in a field in the rain. I guess it is supposed to resonate with unbridled passion - but all I could think of is how uncomfortable the lovers would be, in the cold English rain and damp prickly hay. I generally enjoy tasteful erotic scenes, but the concept is preposterous.",2006
8,"This film at first doesn't seem like a typical Woody Allen film but at the end you know it's one and why. While the story and theme is familiar, Mr Allen brings new perspective and avoids clichés. He goes to the themes he explored in ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" but without the Ingmar Bergman homage. Instead it's more fun and exciting to watch. I guess the young hot cast and new location doesn't seem like the usual Woody Allen film, even though he used young hot talents before. This one belongs to his best films which is good news to his fans. The cast is excellent but the supporting cast outshines the leads somehow. Matthew Goode made a strong impression and sure to become a star in the near future. I'm glad Woody Allen changed locations and used some of the best British actors for a change. I guess people who will read this comment, will already know about the plot, so I will avoid it. I watched the film at Cannes where it was well received by critics and the audience.",2005
2,"In this film Woody Allen does for present day London roughly what Dick van Dyke did for cockney chimney sweeps in Mary Poppins - that is, strike an almost unending series of false notes. Jonathan Rhys Myers plays Chris Wilton, a tennis pro whose every gesture suggests privilege; we are asked to believe he comes from a poor Irish background. The Hewitts, the family with whom he becomes involved, do not work as individuals, and do not work as a family. So many little things aren't right. Mrs H dresses like a woman a couple of social classes below her, for example. The portrayal of business life is also a travesty. Mr H has the general demeanour of an antiques dealer, but the plot has him run a string of companies (called Hewitt Inc, though of course British firms are plcs) where he has no problems installing his son-in-law and giving him the sort of car and chauffeur that would not normally go to anyone below board level in a FTSE-100 firm - if then. Daughter Chloe simply sets up an art gallery in one of the smartest parts of London - Emily Mortimer who plays her and comes from this sort of milieu really should have known better.",2006
1,"SJ and JRM obviously needed at least some direction from Woody Allen to develop their characters past the point of a teenage crush gone wrong. In their defense, it must be said that the plot was clunky and full of holes and the dialog was amateurish so they didn't have much to work with. Emily Mortimer and Matthew Goode did as much as they could with their one dimensional characters which was to be charming and sweet.",2006
3,"1) As the film progressed it became hard to believe that the main male character, Chris Wilton,as portrayed by J.R. Meyers, was so complex and driven that he would murder two people to sustain his life. I think the script was OK on this but the casting wasn't. 2) The planning/execution of the murders as filmed was a class b movie. The suspense! Will he get caught in the planning or the act!? 2a) During the murders, committed with a shotgun (loud noise folks!), no movie neighbor could hear the gunshot. Why? Because the soundtrack was playing operatic music quite loudly. BUT FOLKS, THIS WAS THE SOUNDTRACK, NOT REAL AMBIENT SOUND. A Monty Python influence perhaps? 3) Without explanation the killer carries incriminating evidence with him from the city to the country He couldn't go to the Thames at night and dump the stuff? 4) With poetic license heavily imposed, the killer finds the ring of a victim he's killed and doesn't do a good job throwing it into the river. It bounces on the river's railing (tennis anyone?) and ends up on the walkway. WHERE A TO-BE MURDERED JUNKY FROM THE EARLIER SCENE OF THE TWO MURDERS MIRACULOUSLY FINDS IT. My goodness, what a coincidence! Miscellaneous: a)Other critiques have mentioned the initial Chris and Nola sex scene and I would underline their criticism: in broad daylight, during that rainstorm, would even that kind of passion permit the two of them to Let's Do It In The Road? Without a fear of being seen? I don't think so. b)Tired, tired, tired was the Son-in-law Also Rises cliché. What the hell did he do at father-in-law's firm? c)The two cops at the end were almost cartoon-like in being added to flesh out the ""irony"" of the story. Reminded me of Bugs Bunny cartoons where Bugs reaches into a pouch and pulls out a deus ex machina-like invention.",2006

3,"Sorry, just thought this was awful. It was obviously trying to make some points, but trying way too hard. For example, the scenes with the detectives felt like they were talking directly to the camera. You could summarize the whole film with ""the upper class live privileged lives."" The body of the film was various actors mooing along these lines. And I would have found it a much better film if it hadn't been a murder film, which is cheap to resort to for making a point.",2006
2,"Ridiculous thriller with an entirely unconvincing feel. I haven't lived in London for some time but it's nothing like the city in this movie. It reminds me of Hitchcock's late film Frenzy, also set in London, but a London that hadn't existed since the 30s. And the plot! None of it holds together for a moment. Who are these rich people? They don't behave like aristos. They don't talk like them. Are they nouveau riche? But they have the habits of old money. Or at least the pretensions. And how can an American actress be working in the UK? The union wouldn't let her. She seems to support herself effortlessly on one commercial? Do you know what that would pay? And JRD is just not up to it. Perhaps not his fault. The acting is never anything but functional. And all the opera malarkey is only there to add a specious gloss of culture and scale.",2006

Director Shane Black loved the term and chose it as the movie's title because, ""it so clearly represented what this film is."" And what exactly is this film? Good question. For starters, it's original. It's a nice change of pace from all of the sequels and remakes we've been inundated with recently. I needed this breath of fresh air after being blind-sided by the news that a remake of Robocop might be on its way.",2005

This seemed to be the case for the first couple of minutes of narrative monologue before the jokes started coming fast and furious. This turned out to be a highly entertaining comedy/buddy film couched in a tongue in cheek film noir setting. The dialogue was witty and the chemistry between Robert Downey Jr and Val Kilmour was great. Some of the jokes went by so fast that I'll have to see this movie again to see what I missed as I was still laughing at the previous one. The director spoke before the movie and commented on how the producers were nervous about the risky choice of actors. This was a reference to Robert Downey Jr.'s past addiction problems, but this film proved that he was worth the risk. I saw 10 films at this year's film festival and this one was my favorite.",2005

10,"I saw a special screening of the movie yesterday and I thought it was going to be so boring, but I was entirely wrong! It was very funny and well written. It was a refreshing take on screenplays and acting and its great to see Robert Downey Jr. back again. Val Kilmer's role as Gay Perry was also spectacular. Michelle Monaghan looks like she can be Liv Tyler's little sister but with more substance (sorry Liv Tyler fans) I loved the sarcasm and humorous one-liners used throughout the movie. The constant reference to real life actors and movies gave it an almost ""real life"" feel. I recommend this movie for a good laugh and great narration by Downey, Jr.",2005
1,"This movie features two of my favorite actors in Kilmer and Downey. It also boasts the always enjoyable Larry Miller in a too-small part. Despite this I found it to be nearly unwatchable. Michelle Monaghan may be pretty but she is nearly charisma free and the reasons for Downey's character's obsession with her character is not at all understandable in terms of the information the film presents or the way it's portrayed. The ending seems pretentious and though the intention seems to be that the audience should join in the nod and wink the film, having failed to bring us in on the side of its protagonists leaves us unwilling or unable to do so.",2006

1,"I found this movie difficult to watch. It just feels like its trying way too hard to be hip and edgy. Its not gripping, you don't care what happens to the characters, its not funny, and because it so dull you find yourself giving up on following the story and then wondering what the hell is going on. Its a shame because I really wanted to enjoy this film, the reviews were good and I had reasonably high hopes. However I felt really let down by the obviousness of it all. Sure I really enjoyed watching Michelle Monaghan, she is gorgeous, but her character is awful. She plays a slut, and I guess its somehow suppose to be funny that she has slept with everyone under the sun, but really, again its cheap and obvious. I love Robert Downey Jnr, he is great, I love him in NBK and Iron Man, and his acting in this is pretty good I guess, but you just don't care about his character, he is annoying and unfunny and again everything seems obvious and trying to be wacky and funny, but its not. Im not that hard to please, I enjoy watching films, a lot, I have a large collection, but this movie is being removed from my shelf and is now making its way to the second hand movie shop!",2012

Everything is this movie appears to be made for the target audience (18-25 year old men) to relate too and or project themselves into relating to it. The fast smart talking protagonist, who only values cars, money and sex yet adds a level of half baked nihilism to justify his completely shallow cravings. The GQ model gay hit-man who we never see engage in one slightly gay act, or the 20 something model slut-chick who spends half the movie running around in her bra and panties. Everyone in this movie is a supermodel, NO ONE plays a convincing person, not one, every actor plays a stereotype from another movie. Nothing ever slightly goes beyond surface in this movie, it is all about looks, one liners, catch phrases and NON STOP pop or club music. here are more cuts, flash backs, flash forwards, and moving shots that 80% of the music videos on MTV.

The Big Themes are present here - Evil, Regret, Forgiveness, Atonement - they are just never properly addressed. Shane Black manages to be slick, cool, ironic and charming in this movie.

I think the director had the idea that he should have a lot of twists in the movie, logical or not. The last part is very weak, lengthy and very improbable. It is not fun nor thrilling. In the end I felt quite disappointed. It is Okay for TV watching, but it is not worth even recording on VCR or DVD.",2010

Val Kilmer as supporting actor another brilliant choice. Fast, funny, furious dialog that compels the movie goer to see it again if only he could. For a reason that I can't find anywhere this movie was barely show at all. The theater I went to in Denver was on odd choice to show it but it was worth THE 80 MILE drive I had to make. I'll buy the DVD so I can see it again to listen to all the parts I could not catch over the howling laughter of an ALL AGE GROUP audience. My brother who lives in L.A. could not find a theater to see it. Very strange since the movie is essentially about L.A., the movie biz, and well just about everything else thrown in. I can't even find a DVD release anywhere. Does ANYONE know why the studio did not distribute this movie? Why despite adamant great reviews Hollywood pulled the movie? Something strange is going on here. Perhaps this is a case for the new detective agency that... wait I don't want to give anything away. JUST SEE THIS MOVIE. DEMAND TO SEE IT TODAY!",2006

As Matt arrives, we learn that Shannon's wide-boy-made-good husband Steve (a cast-to-type Marc Warren) has quietly planned a romantic evening with the missus, evidenced by a pair of hard-to-come-by show tickets.

10,I saw a screening of Hooligans at the SXSW and I was blown away! What a great film. The cast was excellent. The director was superb! Great action and still very profound! This was a great role for Elijah Wood. A very nice departure from his usual roles. Charlie Hunnum was excellent. And Leo Gregory as Bover was awesome. The action scenes were incredible. I couldn't believe this film was directed by a woman. She really portrayed the lifestyle of soccer hooligans realistically. Such a different view than the press gives. I can't wait to see more films by this director! When is this movie going to come out in theaters so I can recommend it to all of my friends?,2005

I hope this film is released on this side of the herring pond. It is thoroughly entertaining! I was a little worried about the probability of a clean-cut kid from Harvard being drawn so easily into the lifestyle of football hooliganism for any reason, but it works well. Even though I still think it would have been more convincing if Matt had a background that would indicate a slight interest violent sports, say if he was a kick boxer or push hand enthusiast, for example. Matt's motivation bothered me more than any of the violence depicted. Still, it is an excellent film.",2005

Lexi said in Q&A that this is based on some of the *firms/gangs* she was exposed to as a kid, and that it's not make believe--this stuff really goes on. I also learned that Lexi is a martial arts expert/champion (I think she's undefeated?).",2005

I felt I should write a mini review because I felt I needed to point out a few things.",2005
3,"Where to start? OK, don't compare this film to fight club for a start - ridiculous. If it was even a patch on fight club, the violence, blood, gore etc would be much more evident and realistic. Secondly, this film is no football factory - which is so much more real (and Danny Dyer makes Nicholas Nickelby look like an embarrassment). Fair enough, the storyline is quite decent and the fight scenes are well choreographed - with a decent ending i might add. But the film on the whole is poor, seriously poor. As people have been mentioning the accents should not spoil a film - i disagree - either a simple casting error, or a lack of effort in coaching the voices caused the film to be irritating all the way through - it was obvious from scene one some American/Geordie was playing the role. Don't get me wrong, good looking guy, who looks great with a skin head - but no not a football hooligan. I could go on forever about how ridiculous the football scene was - the 'fake steward' situation. Also, when the GSE are going to play United up north, they go on the train expecting only 3 of them - doesn't make any sense - this a real organisation of gangsters and thugs, which is portrayed in the film to be some mickey mouse cult of about 5 people. In terms of accuracy - did West Ham and Milwall not play for the last couple of years they have been in the Championship together? Hmm, ten years OK. And I'm sure 'Bother' would be able to just waltz into a Milwall firm pub. Basically, a very poor film which people will like if they have little knowledge of real football, and hooliganism. If you do actually love football and are intrigued by the underworld of hooliganism,, you will simply feel as though this film has insulted your intelligence. Ross George",2005

The script reminds me of badly thought through BA Film Studies students shorts that I had to mark. The whole thing smacks of desperation and is awfully uncinematic with far too many shots taking place inside dimly lit pubs and grimy streets. The dialogue is appalling and there just isn't any redeeming quality to these people.

I don't intend to sound overly endeared with this film - it wasn't ""groundbreaking"" in any sort of way - but it was a film worth seeing. Was it believable? No. New York couldn't be so simple and there has been no human being in the history of mankind that has the ""hutzpah"" of Hitch. Sure, there are bar-studs, but not ones that can get any chick, at any time - excluding those raking in seven figures, of course.

He proved once and for all that he does not need to be holding a gun to be a great actor in a movie. Kevin James was also very impressive. I admit that I've always like him on ""The King of Queens"" but this role really brought him into the light more, and i hope to see him on the big screen a lot more in the near future. The movie was funny and adorable and I recommend it to any guy as the best date movie you could ever imagine. The mix of comedy, romance, and drama left me feeling complete. It's nothing like most ""chick flicks"" in the sense of tears and sadness, but holds its own and i think can be equally enjoyed by males as well as females. I encourage all couples especially to see this movie but even if you aren't involved with someone you may pick up some great ideas from Hitch. ",2005

""Hitch"" is smooth, I hand you that, but the formulaic code by which the implausible proceedings unfold, makes the whole damn thing very irritating. I didn't believe in the melt down of Eva Mendes for a minute. The happy ending made me think and predict a ""Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf?"" in their near future. There is an element of hardness and of selfishness that the cuteness couldn't mask. I couldn't help longing for Billy Wilder and I.A.L Diamond, for a moment of truth, no matter how ugly. Real comedies have that from Lubitch farces to Rock Hudson/Doris Day pastiches. None of that is present here.

My instincts usually tell me that film like this will be predictable, annoyingly frothy, and sentimental, although able to raise the occasional smirk. Well, my instincts were pretty much right. Hitch (Will Smith) is a date-doctor who takes on his biggest task yet - to teach how overweight corporate idiot Albert (Kevin James) to romance celebrity Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta), whom Albert has become smitten with.

6,"Okay. Here we go. Before watching this film, if you read what it is going to be about, you will find something that could be promising. Four animals that are close friends in a zoo end up being stranded in the wild where one of them--the lion--finds out that it is his nature to hunt down the other three. Now that makes a good story! But the thing is that the story barely even touched on that. It seemed to go nowhere and throughout the time that I watched this, I felt as if it were still beginning and we were being introduced to the characters, including the ones that later come into play. I didn't feel as if the peak of the plot was ever reached because I started thinking: What is the plot? Where is this movie trying to go? Nothing really happens. This film is like a large introduction that never really goes anywhere. It barely touches the middle of the story when it suddenly ends. A big hole was certainly there when the credits came up. A lot could have been done with this story. We also never really connect with any of the characters. They are just there. The voices are done well and they really match with the characters, but that's mostly it. There is not a lot of character development. But the good news is that many kids will enjoy this. There is plenty of light humor, especially with the penguins who steal the show most of the time. There are cute parts and the visuals are all right. This is no Shrek and it is a little below Shark Tale in my opinion. Dreamworks could have had a much better film. So much more could have happened on this island, but alas we were only introduced to it and nothing else. No, this movie is not horribly bad, but it is not very good either. I give it an average at best. It is watchable but that is it for me. The story was handled too weakly. This movie really had potential. But hey, at least the kids most likely will enjoy it =)",2005

Some funny visuals as well (won't spoil those here) but this movie is nowhere in the league of Shrek or the better Disney stuff, and certainly not as funny as the highlight reel that was the trailer being shown for the last couple of weeks on television. If you haven't gone yet, you might want to wait until it hits your local second-run discount theater, or just rent it because as another poster mentioned, it is in no way worth spending $50+ for a family of four. And the poster who gave it a 10-star review, along with his blathering drivel of a review (""reel"" indeed, ugh) is an obvious studio plant, pay it no mind.",2005
2,"I take a vested interest in what we feed our children's minds. They deserve to be challenged to think. They need abstraction. Levels of thought. Something to exercise their brains and help cultivate their own senses of creativity. That said, Dreamworks should be ashamed of marketing this dreck to children.",2006
8,A wonderful movie for all ages.,2005
10,This is a children's' movie. I think people keep forgetting that when they review it. Kids would LOVE this movie. I am an adult and I went with my adult sister and we were just howling with laughter the whole time. There were a few science fiction movie jokes in there that almost killed me dead laughing. I think kids would love the animals. They were cute but not cutesey. Ben Stiller's voice was perfect for the silly lion character. Chris Rock didn't say anything too shocking. The animated scenery was beautiful. The characters were all good. It was jam packed full of humor and grooviness. A lot of the imagery reminded me of groovy retro stuff. (I'm partial to groovy retro stuff.) I think you should make up your own mind whether to see it or not instead of reading reviews. Wink wink nudge nudge. Cheers,2005
2,"This was the most obnoxious animation I've ever seen. I could barely stand to watch the movie, as the characters were constantly yelling in my face. Every character reminded me of Poochy from the Simpsons, in the worst ways possible.",2006
5,"For me, Pixar will always hold the crown when it comes to superb animation. Nearly every one of their films has been a joy. None of the other production companies come close. Pixar films are effortless the way they combine laughs with a good story, as well as crafting tremendously endearing characters.",2006
5,"Madagascar simply lacks in strong story-telling, and drags throughout the movie, as though the writers were trying to squeeze 90 minutes out of a half-hearted premise. It relies on too many clichés and tired sight gags, that in the hands of other film-makers might have been cleverly delivered, but in Madagascar they are merely annoying. Smaller kids may find the visuals appealing, however older viewers beyond the toddler demographic, and certainly adults, will feel trapped by a meandering, tedious plot. Dreamworks' efforts on this and its other animated features are unquestionable inferior to the high quality and charm of Pixar's films. Perhaps they can steal away some of Pixar's talent.",2006
5,"Wow, they just keep peppering us mainstreamers with animated comedies, don't they? In any case, this is a lesson you will want to skip or at least drift off into thought or scribble in your notebook during. I think the makers have got the basic idea right: take wild animals  a Zebra, a Lion, a Giraffe and a Hippo  raise them domesticated in the glossy captivity of a New York zoo, then ship them off to Africa and see how well they do out in the wild. The film is an ecological/social experiment of sorts in which you essentially extract the average Joe from his comfortable life and plug him into hell. There is a wealth of potential in a premise like this, but DreamWorks suffers far more hits than misses in 'Madagascar'.",2006
1,"Here is a cartoon with no charm, no well-developed ideas, with no chemistry among its main characters. It's a pity since everyone is trying so hard. It would have been a ""O"" but that wasn't possible. The backgrounds were nice...",2005
1,"After all the hype at the time, I really considered myself lucky to finally get to see this movie. That was before the first 5 minutes. Boy did this movie stink! Boring, unsubtle, embarrassing, cliché ridden, utterly stupid, racial stereotyping, toilet humor, disgust and stupidity are some of the word that come to mind. The characters are unoriginal, idiotic and offensive. This piece of crap would probably have no problem in keeping a naive 5 year old entertained for about 2 hours but any one with a shred of intelligence and some experience with such movies would be far from impressed. And people found King Julien funny? His stereotyped accent was a dig at yet another race. It did'nt sound funny. It sounded stupid and very intentional.",2006
6,"I have to admit that ""Madagascar"", the latest film from the makers of ""Shrek"", didn't really appeal to me. From the trailers I'd seen, I thought it looked too kiddie-friendly to me but as my Better Half wanted to watch it, I found myself renting the DVD along with ""Team America: World Police"". I had already seen the short Christmas film with the penguins and that was very funny and that had made me change my mind a little. But I was pleasantly surprised to find this an unexpectedly witty and genuinely funny family film, although one which doesn't really seem to go anywhere plot-wise.",2006
4,"This was amusing but the humor focused on crotch kicks, slapstick falls, and dope slaps. There was a visual ref to American Beauty which was funny. However there was also a punchline which referred to something being ""zip-lock fresh"" which must have cost the advertiser a pretty penny and is another example of what is wrong in contemporary movie production.",2005
10,"I just attended a press screening in Los Angeles. This movie is a ""reel"" hoot. It was simply hilarious. The spoofs, take-offs, and references to other movies, music and characters come fast and furious - so you'll probably need to see it several times to catch all of them (shh, no talking in the theater). The plot - a bunch of New York City zoo animals end up back in the wild with all their madcap adventures along the way. Excellent animation, voices, music and jokes. The spoiler - it was over in 85 minutes and I wanted more - I was spoiled. I can't wait for Madagascar 2! And, please stay seated until the end of the credits, the complete end - you will be treated all during the credits with a special treat at the very end.",2005
5,"We planned my son's 7th birthday party around Madagascar -- the hot new animated movie coming out on the holiday weekend: hooray! If only it had lived up to the hype. First, the kids did like it. Second, the adults pretty much only liked the obscure references, the penguins and the lemurs. OK, everyone likes the lemurs. Here's what I'm saying: don't plan a party around this thing, OK? Because after seeing this, coming back to your Madagascar-decorated house is sort of an embarrassment ... Most of the performances seemed under what the visual outrageousness of the characters demanded, and, I'll just say it, Ben Stiller was a big disappointment. Chris Rock was adequate, but you never forgot he was Chris Rock. The other two main characters could have been voiced by anyone else with as much success. I'm sure we'll end up buying this thing on DVD, but it had better be on sale ...",2005

8,"This is not a creative cooking contest. It's not supposed to be. If you want a show where the chefs get to display their culinary ingenuity, hit up Top Chef or Iron Chef, etc. That being said, this is a great show if you take it as is: it's about people getting yelled at by Chef Ramsay for not working and cooking his way. The chefs are not there show that they have their own style of doing things, but to prove they can survive the stress of working in one of Ramsay's kitchens.",2009
2,"I firmly believe that Seasons 2-6 are enjoyable for everyone to watch but the show's downward spiral has been immanent since Season 9. First of all, Gordon does a lot of stupid things you would never do in a kitchen, I can forgive getting up and shouting right in people's faces and dismissing them halfway through service due to putting in a terrible performance and sending them to the pantry and warning them to get their act together. It's when he makes stupid-ass decisions you would NEVER make if you were him.",2015
5,"I started watching this show several years ago, when it was new (in America) and fell in love with it. It had a good first few seasons, But then it began to parody itself, and seemed to dumb itself down painfully. It became more about 'the characters' then food. The premise becomes hard to take seriously. At this point, each episode is perhaps 30% flashbacks from within the episode itself. It feels like filler--- which is good neither in food nor TV. Now, the announcer explains every five or so minutes that something incredible and brand new and never before done will happen... and the hype gets exhausting.",2010
8,"Hell's Kitchen isn't a show about learning how to cook well. It isn't a How-to show in cooking. The whole appeal is in Gordon Ramsay tearing people apart. Either you enjoy that aspect of the show, or you don't. It's an acquired taste (no pun intended).",2008
7,As a rule I am not a fan of reality TV. What makes this show go with me is Gordon Ramsey. He is very very good at his role on this.,2007
6,"What's been already said here pretty much wraps it up, but i wanted to throw in my own two cents for Ramsay. I'm not sure which episodes of which seasons i was watching, but i saw about four, and i wanted to post this simply in defense of ""chef."" He's really not being such a jerk. Anyone who has had any experience in food AT ALL should be downright shocked that a single one of the contestants considers themselves anywhere remotely near competent. If I'm not mistaken, every one of the contestants has worked in a restaurant or graduated from a cooking school. I'm dumbfounded. These people are absolute, unequivocal, idiots, and the true pleasure of this show (and yes, true pleasure can be found) is in watching them make complete fools of themselves. Ramsay entered into a bad deal when he signed this contract. The prospect of one of these dolts running the restaurant of a serious chef has got to be a painful one for him even if he's making boatloads of cash off of it. He has every reason to yell his head off.",2006
8,"I love this show! I have only seen it a few times but I would give it 8 stars cos it was entertaining, was to do with food and actually gave me some cooking lessons.I can see why people dislike Rasmay and if you don't like it just turn the channel.I have to give it 10 lines as a decent review so here it comes Rasmay may swear more than he uses non profane words but he likes to be tough and get the kitchen into the right order.Usually when this show is on there's something on but I watch it during the ad breaks.Rasmay may be hard to please such with quotes as "" ITS NON STICK!"" slandered at the contestants but he is trying to teach the contestants the right way to make their customers happy.I must admit that this is really funny.If you like a lot of profanity,Gordon Rasmay and food you MUST see this show",2008
1,"I have to admit I'm still watching this show, even though I'd deduced after the first episode that it was absurd - nobody can possibly do good work of ANY kind when some crazed lunatic is screaming at them and switching the agenda every five minutes (as in the last episode, when he had the four of them switching stations like hamsters in a maze). I would never allow myself to be at the mercy of Ramsey for any price, including my own restaurant (which the supposed 'winner' will be getting - whooptee doo).",2005
1,"I have watched Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares and The F Word, and loved both of them. But I cannot stand watching Hell's Kitchen. It seems to embody everything that is wrong with American reality TV. ",2006
4,"It should be no surprise this show is painful to watch, due to the inevitable title, but there is more yelling and drama than focus on cooking. I rather enjoy Chef Ramsay, particularly in ""Kitchen Nightmares"", but this show is just too much. He exceeds the limit of being over-the- top with his anger, sometimes shoving people and throwing objects...He needs to grow up. It's just a game really...I assume the customers know their on a rash show, so why should they be surprised if things aren't perfect? They could always go somewhere else if there's a half-hour wait on the appetizer!",2009
2,"Year after year, this show looks exactly the same with the same ""twists,"" the same band of witless cooks (how can any of these people actually do a good job where they're supposed to wind up if they win?), and the same mistakes, over and over and over... ""You've burned the risotto! How can you be so #%$#$ stupid?"" Or: ""The risotto is soupy and has no salt!"" Or ""The beef wellington is raw!"" And on and on and on, ad nauseum.... I only watch this show because my wife does, but it 's becoming more and more torturous to do so. A good acronym for this show is A-S-S: Always the Same S#@*. Because you're going to hear a cuss word on the show about every 15 seconds; you can set your watch by that. The ""goodnight"" from Ramsey will always be ""P#@$ off."" And there will always be terribly overweight cooks dripping sweat into their dishes as predictably as getting bad pizza at Chucke Cheese. Ugly people abound on this show more so than on any other. And it's not just physical. I would swear that every cook was brimming with hatred and bitterness toward all of their fellow human beings if I only watched this show. Being stuck watching this show because of a spouse is in itself ""Hell.""",2012
3,"The first few seasons of this show are excellent. Great care was taken in the finales to feature the finalists' menus and managerial skills.

That all ended years ago, and it's unfortunate.",2017

She always tries to set the tone in order to keep herself from elimination. She goes from one chef to the other trying to eliminate the one she doesn't like so she will remain on the show. Obviously her skill lack something or she would not do it; she would just shine with her skills. Corey is so insecure that anyone could manipulate her.... her cooking, thinking, looks, everything. So sad. I believe that Petrozza is the best choice because although he was present during the beat up on others meeting, she did not initiate them, just participated.",2008

10,"Please forgive the cheesy opener. I know that ""Rent"" hasn't started off with the best press in the world. Some questioning Chris Columbus' direction, some questioning the actors, some questioning the film in general. All I can say, however, is wow! I must admit that I was extremely skeptical about the entire project, and that I'm not a ""rent-head"", and this wasn't one of the movies on my wish list to see, but it satisfied me plenty. First off, lets talk story: most know the story, the one of eight East Villagers struggling with everyday life, with a few extremes. Just problems like money issues, drug addiction, and AIDS! A story that could easily be drove full speed into cliché heaven, but doesn't. It makes you feel the ups and downs of these characters. And how they convey all this not only through dialogue, but through song as well. Which brings me to my next point: the music. Being a theater major, I have heard the original cast album quite a few times, and not that it was bad, its just the movie music has this ""pop"" to it that vibrates your eardrums and your heart in the best ways. And like I said, no disrespect to the original. My final point centers around what many are saying will destroy any chances of this movie entering the Oscar race: the direction. Well, sorry to disappoint the Columbus skeptics out there who think he should stick to ""Home Alone's"" and ""Harry Potter's"", but he captured exactly what this movie was about. The grittiness, the hardships, life, love, NEW YORK! He gives the movie realistic credibility, which is always hard to accomplish with musicals (i.e. - people breaking into song and dance on the subway). These people sing, and it makes you think no differently of life. And to touch up on one more thing, the acting, what can you say? This cast overcame unbelievable obstacles to make this work, and they did just that. Anthony Rapp does an amazing job in leading this cast. ""La Vie Boheme"" hasn't left my mind since I left the theater. Adam Pascal and Rosario Dawson are such a couple to watch. Such chemistry between the two. Their developing relationship throughout the movie makes you laugh, cry, and, well, cry a little more. Another scream of a relationship was Idina Menzel and Tracie Thoms as Joanne and Maureen. Talk about an unlikely couple! Somehow, though, they make it work oh so well. Taye Diggs is gold, as usual, as the roommate turned landlord to Mark and Roger. The two that really caught my eye, though. The performances that will go in my photographic movie character memory in a very special spot are Angel and Collins (aka Jesse L. Martin and Wilson Jermaine Heredia). Two guys I have yet to see on film (exception with Martin on ""Law and Order"") brought to the movie what this movie was about the most, and that is love. ""I'll Cover You"", sung by the duo, will melt your heart in a second.",2005
9,"So I'm reading the reviews...none seem too terrible, most are lukewarm, and some are even good. But one theme seems to override them: the material is ""dated."" Figures that journalists, whose livelihoods depend on presenting news flashes that will easily fall into the shadows after something more captivating happens, would find this material dated. You really think the topic of people living with -- not dying from -- AIDS is dated? Wake-up, friends...I'm not one to throw around statistics, but even I can tell you that AIDS is a much bigger problem today than when Jonathan Larson -- a genius in his own right -- wrote this almost 20 years ago. And drug addiction? Yeah let's not even guess how much that statistic has surged.",2005
10,"I have been sitting on this review for a while, and I actually have not had time to come around and post my thoughts. A crew member of mine from OC scored me some advanced screening tickets through Sony Studios, which basically meant there was about thirty of us in a small theater watching RENT on the big screen.",2005
9,"Everything said in the first post is pretty much correct - except some minor points. I'm a MAJOR Musical Theater fan, but I've never been much of a 'Rent-head', (I find the story a bit pretentious and self aware - basically a modern version of ""Hair"") - yet the emotion and energy is real and infectious, fueled by an incredible and memorable score.",2005
7,It's obvious this musical has an incredible fan base. That became evident when we saw the movie version the other day. There were a lot of young people in groups that came to see what director Chris Columbus did to the musical that is still running on Broadway after nine years. The screen adaptation is by Steve Chbosky.,2005
9,"I saw 'Rent' at a screening on Nov.12. I had seen the stage version both in NYC with the original cast as well as in LA with a different cast. The music and story has been echoing in my head for the past 10 years. So I was bound to be critical, but determined to be open-minded as this was going to be a film, not a stage musical. Chris Columbus did a wonderful job in preserving the message and feelings Jonathan Larson I think wanted people to take away with them. The changes made to bring this story to the screen were artfully accomplished. The film is gritty and sad and has a feeling of hopelessness that was difficult to transmit in a stage venue. The music that made it into the film is spectacular, and the soundtrack is indeed better than the OBC recording. The loss of several songs, though at first disappointing, works in the context of the movie. I hope all you fellow 'Rentheads' give this film the chance it deserves. I will be in the theater on opening day next week to see it again for sure.",2005
5,I'll begin by admitting I have never seen Rent on stage. This review will concentrate on Rent as a movie rather than as an extension of a stage show.,2005
3,"RENT opens full throttle with the cast loudly singing to show us that they are intensely angry about something, though just what they are angry about or why they feel compelled to put it into song is never made clear. Indeed, as the film meanders along for over two hours, it never really goes anywhere beyond the usual contrived plot complications about lovers breaking up and getting back together. ",2005
10,"this movie made me cry. out of joy and sadness combined. the music makes me want to sing and love. the music heals. the story inspires. the music heals. i'm glad musicals are still made. :-) wow. that's really all i can say. beautiful. exquisite. gorgeous. bountiful. soulful. well-edited. and unbelievably acted. and unbelievably directed. with unbelievably beautiful cinematography. and choreography that knocks your socks off. i loved this movie. it's wonderful, and heartening, that in a world and nation so full of hate art can be produced such as RENT! that reminds, affirms, validates, expresses, navigates, investigates, perpetuates, stimulates, fumigates, explicates, redirects, and instigates nothing other than love. and enjoying the moment. and not holding onto the past. timeless lessons. timeless music. Oscar gold written all over this.",2005
10,I thought it was great. I am a huge fan of the stage version but i felt very much the same in watching the movie. i did miss certain favorite moments that had been removed but i feel like the movie worked completely! i wish i could own it already! I felt like Jesse L. Martin and Adam Pascal were amazing to watch. I love everyone but those two really stood out to me. the bursting out into song was not awkward at all and the whole feel of the move over all just really worked. I feel like Christopher Columbus really stayed true to the overall feel and really stayed true to the fans. I was glad to be so moved by a movie. I cant wait to hear more response from fans....new or old.,2005

10,"I saw an early screening of rent tonight in Toronto and loved it! I had seen the musical several times and didn't think the movie could live up to the play. I was mistaken, the movie was incredible!!!! I wanted to clap after every number and I cried just as much as I did when I watched the play. This movie did not hide the fact that it was a musical, the characters would break into song walking down the street, in the subway or at a restaurant. I did hear some people discussing the film afterwords saying that they had to hold in laughter every time a character started to randomly sing. I must say it was a little weird though knowing every line of a movie the first time you see it. If you are a huge Rent fan like myself and know the original CD by heart you will find yourself talking and singing along with the film. This movie is a solid 10 and truly lives up to the musical.",2005

1,"I really wanted to like this film. When learning that Chris Columbus was going to direct the play, I knew inherently the movie could not be as good as the play. The movie was unimaginative, boring, and forced. And while I liked the idea of casting the original members, they seemed too old for the parts, and even their voices seemed aged as compared to the original cast recording. Their voices lacked that youthful spunk I remember when first watching Rent in college. The musical score was changed and did not do the original score justice. Poor Jonathan. While Chris tried to portray New York's raw and gritty environment which came out (sort of), the cast members/directing made each character stand out from their surroundings rather than being a part of the community that Jonathan was trying to portray. Where were all the other drag queens? The other drug abusers? The other artists for god sake? Chris should be ashamed of himself. As a rock opera I think everything should have been sung like the play. Turning it into dialog made it laughable. And what is up with the side commitment ceremony scene between Joann and Maureen? That was just plain crap. I will say though that the message was there and anyone who sees the movie will come away with the message of peace and love no matter who you are or your situation. But as far as artistic value, it lacked depth and I only have the writer and director to blame.",2005
7,"The direction and working of this film were mediocre, and that may be kind. However, they were truly blessed to work with one of the best scripts that Broadway has ever seen and some of the most artistic compositions to cross the Great White Way. You'll see in this review that the story and acting were both good, but in the end enough was missing to take it from a sure-fire Oscar winner to another also-ran that was barely worth mentioning.",2007
9,"I never saw Rent onstage, but as a teacher of high school students was well aware of the complete fanatical devotion to this piece of theatre that was almost universal. My critical viewing classes expressed interest in seeing it when we did movie musicals, so I decided to screen it as a possible candidate.",2007
1,"As far as musicals go, I am a love em or hate em type of guy. I despise Rent with every ounce of my soul. If I could I would eliminate all traces of the movie Rent from the planet. Rent was a more miserable and agonizing time than getting my wisdom teeth removed. The first problem is that the songs are bland and uninteresting, and each song seems like a repeat of the last song with slightly different intonation and a few different instruments. A lot of movies have this problem. However most movies are not musicals. When a musical has bland and repetitive music you have yourself a problem. The second problem is the movie kills off the only compelling character halfway through, leaving you to suffer through the rest of the movie wishing for a swift demise. The remaining characters spend their time whining about what a tyrant the landlord is because he wants his back rent. Imagine that. The landlord wants 3 years of back rent. Apparently the landlord doesn't understand that if you spend your entire time making bad music, you do not need to pay your rent. Rent also spends most of its time hopping between vaguely intertwined plot points, hopping from location to location randomly and in such a fashion that it causes the movie to be about twice as long as a movie such as rent really should be. For instance out of nowhere one of the characters decides to take a road trip, and the movie jumps back and forth between the other characters looking despondent and the character on the road trip, for no apparent reason at all, because at the end of the montage he appears back at their apartment in New York. 30 seconds later the entire sequence is forgotten, and it appears to have little bearing on what happens in the film, other than being a completely extraneous scene with no other use other than delaying the inevitable and welcome end of the movie. Bottom Line: Unless you absolutely hate yourself, do not rent this movie. Rent a compelling musical like Moulin Rouge, Hairspray, Across the Universe, the Producers, Sweeney Todd, or any number of other compelling contemporary musicals. Do not rent Rent.",2008
7,"Let's just say I'm curious to see what somebody who is clueless about Rent thought about this movie. I'm honestly not sure if the things I hated are because I love the show, and if the things I loved are because I love the show. Overall, it left me with the same ""wow, that was something special"" feeling, but at the same time...I dunno...grasping for more? First, the bad news...",2005
9,"There is no doubt in my mind, even after seeing the movie, that Rent is truly for the stage. That bond between cast members and even the characters and audience is essential for its message (one of the reasons I was glad they kept on most of the original cast members). However, it was not the awkward moments in the movie (of which there are a few notable ones) that I was left with, it was the spirit.",2005
8,"I got to go see Sky High at a free preview last night. When I saw the commercials, I wrote this movie off immediately. It looked like a strictly-for-kids, stupid-but-cute, teeny-bopper funfest. Blech!",2005
7,"I saw ""Sky High"" at a preview screening tonight, and I must say I was pleasantly surprised! A lot of laughs for kids and grownups, a couple of good plot twists, and a nice message for the youngsters. Kurt Russell steals the show as an over-the-top super hero, who wants nothing more than for his son to follow in the family business. Kelly Preston looks amazing as his flying super hero wife. A great group of kids play the Sky High students, with cool effects to help them into their roles... and some nice parables about life in high school. I expected lots of eye rolling and lame super hero humor... but there was no lameness, no eye rolls, but plenty of good laughs and sweet moments. Parents, feel free to go with your kids to this one!",2005

8,"I saw the advance screening of this movie last night and I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised! I went into this movie expecting a cheesy kiddy movie and ended up spending the next hour and a half being seriously entertained. The story is about a group of freshmen in their first few months at a super hero high school named ""Sky High."" There are all the familiar struggles of high school, such as fitting in, finding a date, and choosing between the friends you have known and loved your whole life and the new popular crowd. These high school newbies have the additional dilemma of learning to use their powers and live up to the reputations that their parents have established as super heroes. The movie is sweet without sending the viewers into a diabetic coma, and has a great message. The theater I was in was also full of little ones, who I never heard a peep out of! The movie is a great treat for the entire family and will make a great break from the heat or a rainy day activity!",2005
9,"This has the makings of a completely unoriginal hour and a half: super-hero's, high school, special effects. Much to my surprise, it's funny, well acted, and original. Apparently, this movie was in production before the Incredibles was released. It's not a result of the success.",2005
7,"Well, I must say that this movie was surprisingly good for it being a Disney Kid Movie. Now it won't win any Oscars, but it really kept up the Disney Tradition for being a clean and fun film. It was wonderful to see Kurt Russell on the screen again with Disney. The acting, again, not an Oscar performance out of anyone, was clean and sincere, very believable. The sets and special effects were, well, good. The diversity and conflict between students of the school, once again... good. There were some very witty and dry remarks about high school life as well. Good writing. I say the most surprising thing about this film was that it was just plain old fun! It had the patrons laughing as well as I. My 7 year old and my 3 year old loved it and it was still adult enough with a strong enough plot to keep the parents interested as well. All in all, it made for a fun afternoon.",2005
10,"This movie was awesome. I went with two other adults & we all enjoyed it. There were tons of young kids there & in typical Disney style lots of fun things the adults understood, but the kids didn't (like who the principal was in our youth)! The kids around me seemed to enjoy it, along with the adults. If you are looking for an action movie, this is not it, if you're looking for mystery & intrigue this is not it, if you're looking for amazing cinematography, not it, but if you're looking for a fun movie to go to with your family, this is the movie to go see. I got to go for free, but would definitely pay to go see it again!",2005
8,"I remember the days when I was a kid and loved Disney comedies. Son of Flubber, The Shaggy Dog, etc. Then there was the classic period after I got a little older with Kurt Russell Disney movies. Well those days are back and you can even take your kids. It is PG rather than the G of the old stuff but that is only because of violence and that violence is directed mostly at property. The characters are not killed or injured. (A lot better than the Bad News Bears which the theater had warnings up about being a STRONG PG 13). Anyway Kurt Russell is so campy in this one and (what a shock) so is Bruce Campbell. The plot and theme borrow a lot from the Incredibles (which is a good thing because I liked it the best of Pixar's flicks) Also you might think Hogwarts when you see the classes except the high school floats in the sky and rather than potions and avoiding the dark forces the student learn how to be superhero sidekicks and how to build ray guns in science class. Won't go any further on that except to say that those scenes are a hoot. Anyway the good guys win, the bad guys lose, the hero is taught lessons about life and everyone gets a laugh a minute as it all comes about.",2005
9,"Kurt Russell went back to his Disney roots with Sky High, a fresh take on the superhero craze. The story revolves around Will Stronghold( Michael Angarano) who is the kid of two superhero parents, The Commander( Kurt Russell) and Jetstream( Kelly Preston). Will is off to be a freshman at his dad's alma mater- Sky High, a school for superheroes where they can find their powers and learn how to use them. High school angst is then thrown into the mix as Will and his new group of friends, headed up by the typical girl best friend Layla( Danielle Panabaker), are told they don't fit the superhero mold and become sidekicks, otherwise known as the losers of the school.

9,"I attended a screening of this movie last night and I must say this is  the only comic book film I have seen in a long time that I immediately  want to see again.  I was there with a row of press and was invited to bring my kids,  seeing as I do't have any I took my nephew. This boy is all over the  place most of the time, but he was rivited when the movie started and  when it ended he wanted toys, I don't think there are any.  I spent time at a round session conducting interviews of the cast and I  was lucky enough to run into the creator of Sky High, Paul Hernandez. Hernandez was surrounded by Latino press who were all hitting him with  questions. I was about to leave when he stopped me and said jokingly  ""don't worry, I speak English too."" We chatted about his attempt to set  this up as a television series in 94 and how he left the production to  work on Greatest American Hero at Disney, as well as Instant Karma for  New Line, a film he is directing staring the Rock and Pierce Brosnan.  With just the 10 min or so I spent with him, I could tell where the wit  and vision of this film came from.",2005

He deals with internal struggles as well as girls and bullies while evil lurks from a distance.",2005
6,"I admit when I saw the preview I was not hopeful about ""Sky High"" but after some family members had seen and suggested I go, I went. Low and behold I liked it! I laughed all the way through and the special effects (though obvious at times) were impressive. Be prepared for it to be a tad on the corny side, but hey it's a Disney family film, you gotta be expecting some of that. The biggest complaint, aside from the sometimes lacking script and effects, would be Stronghold's best friend Leighla. She is a head strong hippie who wants to make a point so bad she just comes off as annoying. One wonders what writer tried to impose his views into the movie through poor Leighla. What a surprise from Steven Straight as he nearly steals the show as Warren Peace the troubled bad kid. Though Stronghold is supposed to be the star, and everyone's all around hero, you end up watching Warren Peace and wishing he would come sweep you away. Great move getting wonder woman to be the principle, what a cute cameo. Over all this is a movie the whole family will enjoy. The humor carries the otherwise stale plot to the finish, and the kids will love all the superhero action.",2005
8,"Way way back in the day (with apologies to the theme song for ""Phil Of The Future""), Filmation made a live-action/animated series called ""Hero High"" about superheroic teenagers in their school days. Not that I'm accusing ""Sky High"" of filching this premise; this is far superior to just about anything Filmation ever did. It's also the summer's best superhero movie - more appealing than ""Batman Begins,"" better written than ""Fantastic Four,"" and more thrilling than either. It may not have instant cachet or Jessica Alba, but then again you can't have everything.",2005

8,"My mother, myself (24) and my ten year old brother all went to a matinée showing. I wasn't expecting much, since this was a Disney movie but I was very pleasantly surprised. When the credits hit I sat for a moment thinking ""That was really good."" The comparisons to a Hughes movie are warranted and deserved. Kids will love this movie but there is also a fair amount of humor that they might not get as well as the adults will. Some of the best lines were delivered quickly or slightly under breath. A second viewing might be required to catch them all. The actions sequences were acceptable and the super powers themselves were handled with a nice blend or realism and fantasy. I highly recommend this movie to any comic geeks, teen movie fans or anyone looking for something they can enjoy with their children.",2005
7,"OK it wasn't a blockbuster, but how many kids movies are. Few. The movie itself had a nice plot, nothing too complicated, but there were times when even I was surprised. Good for kids and their parents, there were definitely kids and parents laughing alike. I think this movie contains some actors who are really starting to blossom into their careers, at the same time Kurt Russell and Kelly Preston add some familiar faces to this charming movie. You like superheroes, I don't think you'll be disappointed. My only criticism would be that some of the effects were a little cheesy. However, the kids in the audience did not seem to mind.",2005
10,"This movie is a real treat. As the father of 2 young kids, I can't tell you how many ""family"" movies I've gone to that were in fact ""kids"" movies. You know the type of movie I mean, the one that holds little or no entertainment value for anyone whose age contains two digits. I won't mention any names....The Pacifier, Are We There Yet...that would be indiscreet. Anyway...Sky High is a revelation. Not only as a family movie, but also as a superhero movie. The superhero movie has become very popular again, but there have been some problems with some of them. They are either not any fun to watch (Batman Begins), or they are TOO lighthearted and you feel nothing for the characters (Fantastic Four). But here we get a story that is fun, exciting, and humorous, but we get to watch characters we actually CARE about. We want to see where these kids are headed, and what is going to happen to them next. It also deals with the ""clique"" situation that every kid that attends school deals with. Granted it does it in a fantasy setting, but the point comes through crystal clear. The kids are not the typical kids that you see in ""family"" movies. Usually they are uninteresting little runts that we are expected to like just because they're cute kids. No sir, these are kids with PERSONALITY!!!! They are individuals, and we are given a chance to get to know all of them. But don't worry parents, as I said this movie works for the WHOLE family. The adults in this movie are a scream. They may be superheroes or ""hero support"", but they are the ones that WE get to identify with. The parents who have the biggest dreams for their kids, and want nothing more that to see them succeed. And when the parents in this movie are forced to look at the fact that their son might not be able to live their dreams, they realize that he has his own plans, and dreams, and they must support him in his quest. Kurt Russell, Kelly Preston, Lynda Carter, and Bruce Campbell are all outstanding in this movie. Then there is the action. It's pitch perfect for this movie. Fun without being cartoony, and exciting without being violent or brutal. And for anyone like me that grew up in the 80's...you're gonna LOVE the whole John Hughes-type feel to the movie, right down the covers of classic 80's tunes like ""Everybody Wants To Rule The World"". It isn't very often that you can take your whole family to a movie, then leave 100 minutes later, and honestly say that EVERYBODY had a great time. Here is the exception, go see it, make it successful, and change it from the exception to the rule.",2005
6,"This movie is actually sort of a gem of a movie that passed me by when it first came out. There is hardly anyone that knows about this movie, but when it came out I heard from few people that it's a decent movie so decided to give it a try. Watching this movie was sort of like watching a real live version of one of those Saturday morning cartoon shows. Although this is a real kids movie and childish, it has elements that makes it entertaining to watch. It's basically watching a cliché high school with high school students except the students have super powers and the school is located in the sky and is very high tech. This movie sort of reminded me of ""The Incredibles"" except not close to being as good. The characters were okay but didn't really stand out much except Steven Strait cause he sort of looks like that one ""Twilight"" guy. It's basically a very predictable movie that follows most generic direction of Saturday morning cartoons for kids. But it's still sort of a gem and it isn't really a waste of time to watch it.",2011
9,"When I went into sky high, I wasn't expecting much. I only agreed to go because Bruce Campbell, a personal hero, was in the trailer. I was beyond surprised with the quality of the picture. Not only is Sky High chock full of innocent adult innuendos (much like the first Shrek), but even the kids jokes are funny. What adds to it is the endless list of very appropriate cameos, including two Kids In The Hall stars, and the fore-mentioned, Bruce Campbell. As mom and dad, Kelly Preston and Kurt Russel are hysterical. They capture the cheesy comic book attitude perfectly. As Layla, the best friend, the stunningly beautiful Danniel Panabaker gives an impressive performance. Michael Angarano plays the lead, Will Stronghold. While his performance is lacking on the believable side, his facial features and natural look lend itself to the character. All in all, Sky High is corny, cheesy, campy, and ultimately one of the most enjoyable films ever made.",2005
9,"Shy High might have been purposed for little kids, but like most good Disney movies(and only the really good ones)there are different levels of comedy. It was not necessarily the lines which made it great, but the actors who were saying them. There was also a lot of situational comedy, which I will not disclose, but there were times that I was laughing quite loudly through entire scenes. It was almost uncanny how accurate Sky High was to any other high school, just add super powers to the mix. All in all in was an extremely entertaining movie and the moment it was over my sister turned to me (she is in college) and said, ""As soon as this comes out on DVD I am buying it!"" It was hilariously fun, full of laughs and it actually had a good moral lesson. Go see it, you will love it, I promise! ;) Note: The reason why I did not give it a 10 was because I do not believe any movie is perfect. So 9 in my book is amazingly awesome!",2005

But Will is not sure he has super powers, and may get labeled as a side kick. Can Will rise above that, and become the hero he was meant to be?

In the episodes that Charlie would predict the future behavior of individuals using mathematical models, I thought that my profession was being joked about. I am not a mathematician, instead a chemical engineer, but I do work a lot with mathematical models. So I will try to explain to the layman why what is shown is close to ""make-believe"" of fairy tales.",2009
2,"The ""math"" aspect to this is merely a gimmick to try to set this TV show apart from the millions of other cop shows. The only redeeming aspect to this show is Rob Morrow, although his career must have been (undeservedly) waning after Northern Exposure if he signed up for this schlock.",2007
1,"I was so happy to find a show which blends my two favorite past times: watching investigative shows and doing mathematics.

Numb3rs is one of those shows that can be confusing, gets you to think, but also carries an important message with some comical and heartfelt scenarios.

3,"I suppose the idea of using a mathematician to help solve crimes using his expertise does sound interesting. And for one series  not too bad. But frankly I have had enough of the patronising that goes on. Rubbish masquerading as science eventually gets boring and stupid. Blackboards get filled with meaningless twaddle. It's all designed to make us, the viewers, feel stupid. You can make a series where we don't really understand what is going on. ""House"" is a good example. I don't comprehend the medical jargon, but the characters are good and the main actors fine, so it works. ""Numb3rs"" (isn't that a cute name?) is just irritating. All the crimes could be solved by normal police work. In fact the mathematics gets in the way of an occasionally good story. So here's a simple mathematical problem in probability. How much can the average viewer stand before the off switch is found on the TV set?",2006
7,"Asian dramas -- even the ones involving fantasy fighting -- have a certain lushness and a complex texture that I believe only Asian directors can truly capture. So having Rob Marshall, a very American director, step in, is a risk, and for two-thirds of the picture he mutes the frenetic editing and lurid visuals used in CHICAGO, slows the pace of the narration, and achieves the goal in making his vision look as authentic as possible.",2006
9,"I lived in Japan for 3 years and I loved the book, rich with visual imagery. I went to the see the movie with a good deal of trepidation, convinced that they were going to butcher it and sex it up to appeal to American audiences. Instead I sat spellbound in my seat as I watched the images that Arthur Golden has created in my mind with words years before, play themselves out on the screen in front of me. Every shot, ever scene, every tiny detail was just beautiful. I literally did not look away from the screen the entire time. The acting wasn't spectacular. I think they could have found somebody better to play Sayuri. The children were all wonderful. The stand-out actress by far was Gong Li as Hatsumomo. The villain had the best opportunities to show her skills as a thespian. The plot stuck very closely to the book. They eliminated the scenes that they needed to in the interest of time, but they didn't try to take any shortcuts or speed up the plot. I really felt like the story was played out beginning to end without sacrificing any of the meat. You'll read a lot of reviews in the coming weeks praising the gorgeous photography. Every word is true. Words like ""lush"" and ""exquisite"" only begin to do it justice. I've never had the experience of being transported to another time by a movie in quite this way.",2005

10,"I was initially dubious about going to see this film after I read a lot of mixed reviews. However, I am glad that I decided to just bite the bullet and go see it. This is one of the most visually stunning and entrancing films I have ever seen, with a wonderful storyline which had me clutching the edge of my seat in sheer frustration! I absolutely loved the love story that was central to the film, although I was a bit worried by the age gap. lol. It made me really want a snow cone though. I thought Zhang Ziyi was fantastic in the part of Sayuri, and she made the character very endearing and real. I am a big fan of Ken Watanabe, and it was good to see him in a part like this; the relationship was very believable and I thought they were both great. In fact, all the actors in this film did their characters justice and helped to make the film as beautiful and Oscar-worthy as it is. I just loved the story and all the sets that provided a wonderful backdrop for such an emotional, powerful tale. I recommend this to everyone! It's THAT good!",2006

Some critics took it upon themselves to be the defenders of Japanese culture (without fully researching their arguments) and, in the process, betrayed their own racism. ""The film is inauthentic because the actresses do not wear matronly bouffants,"" one said. Riiiiiight. Matronly bouffants are a Western stereotype! But in any case, some of them do and some don't!

1,"Arthur Golden studied in Japan, gathering information for Memoirs of a Geisha, and spoke with Iwasaki Mineko, a retired geiko (geisha). Mineko-san talked with Golden for hours, telling him her life story, answering her every question, on one condition: that she remain anonymous. But Arthur Golden did not keep her concealed. No, at the end of his book, he credited her as his 'inspiration'. But did he stop there? No. He told the public that Mineko-san sold her virginity for a record price, which she did not. Mizuage, which Golden portrays as a ceremonial deflowering of the young geisha, was actually a right of passage where a young geisha's hair was cut. From then on she would wear a wig while performing, and it symbolized maturity. Mizuage was never sexual for geisha. The only time mizuage was a sexual term, was when it referred to Oiran or Tayuu (Japanese courtesans). Perhaps this is a cause of some confusion. But what saddens me, is that Golden, a Harvard grad, had the potential to write an accurate book about geisha. But I suppose he was willing to trade honesty for cash and publicity, like most of us these days. And, because of him, many geisha today must explain to foreigners that their services do not include sex. I really hope to shed led on the dishonesty of Memoirs, both film and book.",2007

It turns out that my opinion of the film that seemed to raise so much controversy over casting and language fell in line with neither the vehemently negative, nor the positive accolades of the critics who hail it as one of the best films of the year. Instead, I left the theater feeling ambivalent, not quite sure to sing its praises or to decry it completely.",2005
8,"Lavish cinematography means 'Memoirs of a Geisha' is never anything less than visually beautiful, and it's hard to think of how any other movie could beat it to an Oscar in this department come March next year. However, the true merit of the film lies in the fact that its sumptuous style does not outweigh substance, something particularly thankful given that such an imbalance was so unfortunately true of House of Flying Daggers, the last major release to star Ziyi Zhang. Instead, the truly enchanting performance of 12-year old Suzaka Oghu, who plays the young Sayuri for the first half hour, ensures attention is captured within her character's story for the rest of the drama. This allows the script to remain pleasingly understated, and also means the unlikely nature of the romance can be overlooked.",2005
2,"The trouble with the book, ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" is that it had Japanese surfaces but underneath the surfaces it was all an American man's way of thinking.

1,"I've rarely been so bored or annoyed by a film. As visually ravishing as it is, it seems to pander to ridiculous Western notions of the East (Edward Said, where are you?), while completely failing to offer any kind of insight into the brutality and sheer nastiness of wartime Imperial Japan. I think it's indicative of the film's problems that so few Japanese were involved in its production: while the lead actresses are all very fine, they don't stand a chance in this thin, stereotypical piece of genre piffle. And if the Japanese kept away, who can be surprised? One look at the screenplay would discourage anything but the hardiest Thespians. Lawrence Olivier himself couldn't have saved a bad script, and even Gong Li, who I idolise, isn't able to do so here. What makes it even worse of course is the fact that the language is a free for all of poorly spoken English, in the genre of Nazi officers saying ""Ve vill kill ze English schweinehund venn ze sun rises!"" On the production side it's the same story: Americans all the way. No wonder that the Japan we are presented with looks more like Disneyland that the land of the rising sun. There's simply nothing to redeem this sorry tale. If ever there was an opposite to the sinewy elegance and sparse power of real Japanese film-making, this is it.",2009
1,"I didn't expect this film to be a master piece. Neither did I expect it to follow the details and the story line in the book in a religious accuracy. And of course it didn't. In fact, this film is characterized by the most terrible pacing and timing, unconvincing acting, and is incredibly poorly written. Just like a money-driven Hollywood film should be. However, those important features (casting, acting, timing, screenplay, etc.) put aside, this film is also under-satisfying visually, with its many dark scenes that prevent one from enjoying the extravagant kimonos that were so carefully thought of. The set design also lacks the Japanese refined aesthetic that is so evident in the book. Not to mention the non authentic make up of the geisha (completely Westernized full red lips, rather than just the bottom lip and many other flaws that are quite disturbing and take away from the exotic allure of the geisha phenomenon). Also, there were many poor choices in changing crucial moments in the plot which made the story quite meaningless emotionally and very unoriginal. If you have read the book and loved it, you can definitely pass on this film. If you watched the film and thought it miserably made, don't let this prevent you from reading the book, which is an incredible experience on its own.",2006
7,"Arthur Golden's novel ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" deserved a better fate.

1,"Having lived in Japan for several years this movie does not reflect the Japanese culture and does not even come close to explain what being a Geisha is all about. Unfortunately, a great opportunity has been missed to bring the Japanese culture a bit closer to the broad Western audience and help demystify the country where Zen, Samurai, the Geisha world of Kyoto originate from. Some of the most poignant moments of the movie are when the Americans are shown in Japanese surroundings.The Geisha dances were not authentic. There was far too much use of Chinese music. A minor but essential detail: proper use of the incense sticks was nowhere to be seen. The Sakura scenes were almost obscenely kitschy ! Interestingly, some of the Chinese actors were quite convincing as Japanese persons.",2006

If you're doing an English film, choose actors who can perform with solid, fluent, un-coached English; the dialogue of the film often sounded forced and melodramatic. The obvious solution would have been to do the film in Japanese; I know the argument that the book was in English, but the story is in Japan, and if you're going to hire foreign actors you might as well do it in a foreign language. The production would have cost less and would have been more profitable in the long run, possibly even an academy award contender. The dialogue and direction otherwise was good; it was just the choice of language that was central to the movie's failure.",2005
1,Wow. Very disappointing. This movie COULD of been so much more. But Rob Marchell decided he was going to be a closed minded American and not choose an authentic route to this movie. ,2006
10,"I have just finished the second episode of ""Ghost Whisperer,"" and I felt compelled to leave a comment. This is the best television show of the new season. Melinda Gordon (Jennifer Love Hewitt) own an antique shop, has recently gotten married, and deals with everyday stress. But unlike anyone else, she has the ability to help ghosts finish their unfinished business and cross over to the other side. The first episode started off as horror, with some extremely disturbing visuals. But it turned into one of the most emotional stories I have ever watched, and the second episode follows in that tradition. I am a guy, and most people think that either this is a chick flick, or a teen horror show, but that's not the case. This drama shows that you should never take things for granted and that you should always do the best you can do! Because you never know if tomorrow will come. There are some people who don't believe in ghosts, and some that do. Either way, this show deserves a chance because it makes the phenomenon believable with convincing performances and story lines. ",2005
8,"I liked Ghost Whisperer. I don't know how long it will last, but who can tell nowadays. (I figured Joan of Arcadia for a seven year run.)",2005
10,"I was a bit worried at first if Jennifer Love Hewitt could pull this off, not that she isn't gorgeous and talented, but the occult has an inherent mushy quality. Gladly I can say that my apprehensions turned to dust. She does pull it off, and the scripting is excellent and varied enough  although the medium will regularly encounter and save a ghost, which sets the form fairly rigidly. Despite this I find that a lot of work has gone into varying the simple theme, the acting is good and the supporting cast is up to standard and especially, 'Love' manages to impart humane qualities without appearing too soft or weak. Some fun also with her mother-in-law. Entertaining and sometimes moving and thought-provoking series. What do we do with our lives? I should also add that the photography is up to movie standards, not uncommon in these days (vide: Lost), but a sign that those are right who claim that TV is where it is happening. We need at least 5 seasons of this and hopefully more.",2006
9,"If you want an edgy show on mediums, then watch Medium. Not that this show isn't edgy, instead I feel it fulfills a separate niche in the TV world - it's almost like comfort food. Ghost Whisperer completely surprised me. I thought it was going to be some dopey show that would be shown in reruns on Lifetime (ironically enough, they show reruns of Medium on Lifetime). Out of boredom one day I turned it on and was pleasantly delighted! Like I said before, it's not super edgy but it's cute, it's interesting, Jennifer Love Hewitt is very likable and her husband Jim is hot, to say the least. It keeps you interesting without layering on the sap. I even enjoy the small town and I am a complete city girl. Bottom line: it's one of those shows that you can curl up with a mug of tea or hot chocolate and a blanket and watch almost anytime - seriously it's like comfort food.",2007
1,"As a movie translator, this is by far the most trashy series I've ever had to deal with. I could write a script like that with my left foot while playing Tetris in the middle of the drum'n'bass jam session. I would only watch this show if I wanted to make fun of all the mistakes they make.",2012
10,"For anyone who has ever lost a love one and wants to believe they went to a better place. This show helps us do that. Week after week. I laugh, I cry and most of all I feel better after watching it. Its definitely a must see. And don't get me started on David Conrad/Jim Clancy. Talk about sexy! The chemistry between he and J. Love is perfect! The kind of relationship we all want. Then there's the wardrobes and the jewelry! This is the first time I've actually purchased an entire first season and I have watched them over and over again. It's that good! I see something new every time. And then there's the plot twists you never see coming.",2006
4,"Mildly entertaining. It definitely did not need 5 seasons, two would have been plenty. Crying in a show works for dramatic purposes but when you do it all the time then when it's needed for emphasis it doesn't work. She cries on every episode... sometimes more than once. So in the situations like when her husband dies or her son goes missing those are supposed to be very dramatic points but we are so used to her tears that it left a little to be desired. And whining... that grates on my nerves like nails on a chalk board does to some people. She didn't whine a whole lot but when she did it was very annoying.",2016
10,"Ghost Whisperer is an amazing show! To me, this is one of my favorite shows, along with CSI. Each episode is really good and it keeps me on the edge of my seat before each commercial, it leaves me wondering what it going to happen when the commericals are over. They are awesome and Jennifer is perfect for the role of Melinda. The plot of the show is really cool, because it's about someone that can talk to the dead, and most of us wish that we could talk to the dead, this show is awesome and there is no other way to describe it. If you love CSI and shows like that, then you'll love this show too!! I can't wait until Friday nights to sit down and put the fireplace on and watch ghost whisperer.",2006
1,"poor writing, terrible acting, and the pursuit of a paycheck, all you need to do is tune into this Jennifer Love Hewitt show called Ghost Whisperer (or Breast Whisperer by the people who know the show relies on Hewitt's only reliable quality).",2008
2,I started watching this show with my mom a few months back. Needless to say none of us really took it seriously. Everything about this show just felt so weightless. ,2015
1,I am convinced this show is about Jennifer Love Hewitt trying to set a record for the number of costume changes per TV episode. This seems like a Teenage Barbie version of Medium. ,2007

1,It's actually -10 (minus 10) ! ,2012
1,My family has watched every episode of Ghost Whisperer. Since the show first aired.......until this season. It is just getting more and more bizarre.,2007
1,I could not watch more than five minutes of this Medium KNOCKOFF. It sucks and Jennifer Love Hewitt does not even compare to the talent of Patricia Arquette.,2006
1,"...is dreadful. After seeing some adverts that made the show look fun and interesting, i gladly tuned in; Big mistake. The writing is predictable and 1D. Ghosts always just want to move on, none of them are angry or confused about what's happened. None of them provide any kind of moral dilemma to the main characters e.g. in the second episode i saw (yes i did give it another try- never again) JLH's husband (through negligence) causes the death of a criminal, after grieving for the guy for most of the episode he finds out the guy was actually criminal and MIGHT have posed a threat to his ex-wife. Having learnt this everything is miraculously fine for him. No worry about his negligence (or any possible future mistakes he might make). No worry about anyone who might have loved the person whose death he caused; kids, mother, brothers etc Would he have been able to forgive his own negligence so easily if the person who died had been a young child? His attitude seemed to be that some people deserve to die.",2006
3,"I am not a fan of this show, I have tried and watched the 1st season, but totally made me drowsy. I like her, but this just doesn't have anything that is worthwhile. Cancelled at the end of the year I'm pretty sure. I just don't care about anything which is too bad. Don't get your hopes up because it's Friday and no one is watching TV really on that night. JLH is the only reason this has even made this far. Overally this is just a filler. Gonna be canceled after this season I think. Her boyfriend totally wasted as an actor. Lame is all I can say. This isn't a vehicle for JLH for her really. She needs to do something better, maybe another ensemble, or back to movies maybe?",2007
9,"If nightmare inducing horror is not your bag then the less you know about The Descent the better. Geordie writer-director Neil Marshall has delivered an accomplished, well acted, out and out horror movie that comes as much of a pleasant surprise as his first major feature Dog Soldiers did back in 2002. Shot in a mere 7 weeks The Descent sees a sextet of undeniably attractive action women leaping headfirst into an Appalachian potholing adventure that goes wrong so quickly you are left wondering if any one of them will survive, let alone ever see daylight again.",2005
8,"There aren't that many British horror films, so it's not too much of a stretch to call this one of the best British horror movies i've seen. It has flaws, but i've only seen a few films in my life that don't. It's incredibly entertaining though.",2005
10,"With Dog Soldiers, Neil Marshall created a tight and claustrophobic atmosphere then added the scares to create a very good horror film. However, the tension was often released with humour and the audience were allowed to catch their breath and relax. At no point in The Descent are you allowed to relax as Marshall grabs your attention within the first few minutes and doesn't let go until the credits roll at the end.",2005
8,"After watching ""The Descent"", my bud Robert and I decided that spelunking would now come off both our ""To Do"" listsfor good. Writer and Director Neil Marshall's ""The Descent"" crafts and sustains an unrelenting tension throughout, once you get past the suspended disbelief. As I watched the women one by one crawl through the tiny water filled crevice to enter the caverns somewhere in the Appalachian Mountains, I thought, ""How are they going to get back? They've got to be nuts!"" Well, you just have to go with it. Well, kind of. Fortunately, director Marshall effectively pretexts the story. The prior thrill-seeking jaunt for the group was a white water rafting trip. Following that trip, Sarah (Shauna MacDonald) suffers a life altering tragedy. A year later, Sarah and her close friend Beth (Alex Reid) join up with the gang at a cabin in the Appalachians. The 6 women are gearing up for a cave exploration trip headed by Juno (Natalie Mendoza). Apparently, Juno regrets not being there for Sarah following her personal tragedy and recovery. Juno sees this trip as an opportunity to empower Sarah. Those along for the ride include Becca (Saskia Mulder), Sam (MyAnna Buring), and Holly (Nora-Jane No one).",2006
10,"What's interesting to me is the deeper meaning and symbols of the film. The film is really about two women. Sarah, and her friend, Juno. The film opens with Sarah losing both her husband and child in a horrific wreck. Over the course of the movie, it becomes apparent that the accident was caused because the husband was distracted and upset over an affair he was having with Juno. Sarah is aware, at least subconsciously, of Juno's betrayal and that it lead to the deaths of her husband and child. She is not in a place mentally or emotionally to acknowledge it on a conscious level. When Sarah awakens from the wreck, there is a sequence where she runs from darkness. The darkness symbolizes a call to action. Sarah rejects it by running from it. She isn't ready yet. This is classically what chase dreams are about. The dreamer is being pursued by their subconscious given horrible form. If the dreamer can make a conscious effort to stop running and speak to the scary thing chasing them, that dreamer's unconscious will speak directly to the dreamer. This would be the conscious (dreamer) dropping the ego defense (running) and interacting with the subconscious (chaser) to gain new insight.",2006
8,"If you've seen the trailer you'll know what your going to get  suspenseful, claustrophobic thriller, when horrible things happen to a group exploring a cave system.",2005
10,"I loved it, I went in expecting something along the lines of ""Dog soldiers"", something funny and enjoyable but instead I got a roller coaster ride of tension and fear. So often these days horror movies just aren't scary, they make you jump they have a little bit of atmosphere and that's it, well this film was scary. It was tense, well acted, and the director made great use of the setting to scare the hell out of you. I don't want to go in to a lot of detail in this review, as I don't want to spoil the experience for anyone who reads it, and that is what this film is an experience I came out of the cinema shaking. This film is well worth your time.",2005
7,"This tense thriller is a terrifying chronicle of six young women who explore caves in the Appalachian Mountains and find unspeakable horror thousands of feet down. A cave-in traps them with no way to retrace their steps, but don't yet know that a terrible fate lurks around the tunnel's next bend. The film is reminiscent of ""The Lost Patrol"" as the ladies band together as much as they can against a ghoulish and unseen foe, with each girl's nerves pushed to the breaking point. The movie's dark, claustrophobic look adds realism to the ghastly dangers that the young women face and the music score is effective. The girls have several encounters with the predators underground and use torches and climbing gear to fight off their attackers. Natalie Mendoza is the group's ambitious leader who misleads the other women about the caves and also tries to cover up an awful deed she committed in a wild flight to escape. The four other women on this ill-fated expedition are also good in difficult roles. This movie is certainly one of the best films of 2006.",2006
5,"Maybe i missed something. That HAS to be it. This movie was one of the worst horror films I've seen in... well, just a couple of weeks. It's SO dam hard to make a good scary movie today, I feel for the people trying to accomplish this mission. I've been a horror fan my entire life; granted, i was born in '85, but who's counting? This movie just didn't follow any continuity- the monster isn't revealed until an hour in (which is fine), but there is no suspense up to that moment. It's just a bunch of girls bickering and drama between mourning, sexual affairs and outright backstabbing. Then, 2 seconds later, MONSTER. Who apparently is a human evolved into blindness and echo location sensitive, but can't find the two girls breathing like maniacs 16inches below him, in front of his face. I will acknowledge the poetic symbolism in some scenes- we all know what I'm talking about. And, I probably have it wrong, but the end is this- she'll never get away from the evils of her past...??? Wrong? Please, I would LOVE someone to convince me this movie is more than a 5/10.",2008
10,"The descent is purely terrifying. It will provide you with an  experience that relates entirely to those of the characters on screen.  Each one is trapped, isolated and alone. In that theatre, you will  understand the fear of having no escape.  The film, like it's big brother 'Dog Soldiers', takes British horror to  it's deserved glory. Unlike such films as 'Creep', which was a complete  mess, The Descent is a chilling experience that places believable  characters into a situation that is strangely real, despite the obvious  fiction.   After a quarter of the film has passed, you pray for the characters  escape as, in a way, you will also be saved from the mental onslaught  that drives into your mind throughout.  I didn't expect anything from this film before I walked into the  theatre it, yet it is the greatest horror I have ever seen, and am  likely to for a very long time.",2005
8,"When I read that ""The Descent"" featured an all women cast I expected a T+A extravaganza with spelunkers in too tight T-shirts and panties cavorting beneath the earth. I was disappointed. What I saw was a scary movie. I am not by nature claustrophobic but a few scenes of the close quarters they were climbing through left me squirming in my seat. I can't continue the review without issuing a SPOILER alert since I will be discussing critical movie facts. The movie was very spookily lit with looming shadows and false colors and was expertly designed. The creatures living below ground were creepy and scary since often they were only glimpsed in the shadows. I hadn't expected the death count to be so high nor the movie to be so bloody. I flinched often during the movie due to the sudden appearance of the creatures or from the wounds suffered by the cast. The pace of the movie once they began the cave exploration was very fast and of course with this type of movie a deeper examination of the facts reveals some plot holes but events move too fast for reflection. I can't say I liked or agreed with some events in the end of the movie. I think Juno, maybe not the best person in the group, was unfairly judged and condemned. None the less the movie was very effective in scaring me and holding my attention. The fact that it had, primarily, an all women cast was hardly noticeable. This is not a chick flic. Worth seeing.",2006
9,"The Descent is an exceptionally good film. I just wanted to state that at the start of this review, because it is easy to dismiss a film like The Descent as having some good gore scenes, but little else to commend it from a directorial or cinematographic point of view. However, with what must have been a budget that pales into insignificance when compared to films like Ring 2, the film packs in top class gore with exquisitely detailed 'creatures' and brilliantly claustrophobic cinematography.",2005
5,"My sister and I had some time on our hands so we thought we'd watch a scary movie... Whilst The Descent did fit the bill, it left us feeling strangely unsatisfied. For starters you want to box the ears of everyone of the girls for being so seemingly unprepared as they trot off for a day's caving. Secondly, their behaviour throughout the movie (especially in the earlier parts when you might expect some kind of rationality) seems illogical. Thirdly the ending is just so ...nnngh! Even a couple of months after seeing it my sister and I mention it now and again in a ""but why....?"" kind of way. Mind you, perhaps that could be seen as a positive, since we're still talking about it, however it doesn't feel like that, more just irritating! (very slight *SPOILER* : SHOCK! The slutty-looking one with thighs of steel turned out to be...slutty!)",2006
10,"I actually wanted to go see Mr and Mrs Smith but it was showing too late in the evening so we chose this one, not having a clue what it was about.",2005
9,Ten.... wow is that is a high rating. The film probably only deserves a nine but with all its genius i decided to give it ten. How often is a horror film one of the best pictures of the year? how often do horror films actually scare the sh-t out of you? how often do horror films grip you in total suspense? how often do horror films have great acting? how often are horror films well made? how often are horror films somehow realistic? HOW OFTEN ARE HORROR FILMS ACTUALLY HORRIFYING?,2005
3,"wow up until now this movie has actually accumulated a score of 7.5 on average... I have to stop and ask myself how? The two lead actresses both seem to wholly overdo their parts, especially in facial expression which to many people I suppose wouldn't mean much, but to an avid viewer of Horror films such as myself, facial expression is often key to conveying the terror to the audience. Aside from this the acting was alright, nothing really notable, with as usual the best character being offed first (Holly). This all is very trivial in the scope of things. The real thing that makes this film awful is... the plot. First and foremost the creatures which suddenly decide to up and kill all of the hikers have zero background. None. We never even learn what they are by the end of the film. I was a little offended by this because I felt like this completely dumbed down the plot to the level of every B movie. There are people, along comes a monster and kills them all with no motive. Thats it. And to add to that the monsters even look like they're straight out of a B movie (either that or they were rejects for Gollum in Lord of the Rings). Now unless you plan on seeing this movie with someone who is very (and I mean very) easily scarred I would recommend skipping this movie and seeing the real deal movie by this director; Saw.",2006
1,"The descent is a disappointing horror gore-fest that is heavy on blood and light on scares and tension. The scenario is preposterous and the creature effects are beyond crap. The characters and the performances are weak. The film is not scary and the characters are unsympathetic, which is ultimately why the film is ineffective. The creatures are pathetic and look like poor versions Smeagol/gollum. The film gets worse as it goes along. The creatures really sink this film to junk levels. The attack/fight sequences look like crap and the camera work is quite inept at time. The lighting is probably the most effective element of the film. The Descent will no doubt benefit from the lowered expectations set by todays extremely low grade, assembly-line sanitized and saturated horror genre. The Descent is by no means a classic or even a good horror movie, but it is better than most of the schlock horror films we see today.Preposterous Scenario, Horrible Creatures, No Scares, Little Tension, and Weak Characters. 4/10 Avoid it unless you are a rabid horror movie fan.",2006
8,"It's refreshing to go to a horror film that's not rated PG13 and get genuinely scared. I wasn't particularly keen on watching this film after seeing the trailer (which in my opinion makes this seem like a terrible B-grade movie), but I'm delighted to say that this is one of the better horror flicks in recent times.",2005
1,What a bunch of big girls blouses !! I can't believe how many of the reviewers thought this was a scary movie.,2005
3,"I don't personally know the authors of this movie, but they couldn't be my friends, not anymore, not from tonight on, since I've seen this horrifically bad horror. No friends, because I just feel they wanted to tease the spectator, take the mickey out of them.",2005
5,"Not knowing what to expect, the movie started rather well, with various references to other movies (road scene rather like ""The Shining"" etc.) and the actors were pretty much OK (What Saskia Mulder was doing here was my first question). Like in real life, you wonder why a group of women (who *so* obviously hate each other) would keep together and pretend to have fun, so the directors added a subplot based on the two main character's dislike for each other. So far so good. The caving was felt as getting more and more claustrophobic, and it was done in a way that the viewer would feel it too: dark, narrow passages, noises, flying dust etc. Then the appearance of creatures, I found, were rather too much: the directors could have relied more on the psychological tension and kept going, as the women would have tried to kill each other anyway (as it was a strong probability from the start). Then it went into such a gore, the pool of blood was such a rubbish thing to add to the scenario: the blood should have been congealed anyway. The alternative ending was like a rebirth of the main surviving character, who ends up free, so why spoil it with a birthday cake as a real ending? In this scenario, it is rather a miracle she survived at all, stuck in this manky cave, but a good reason nonetheless to decide to end it all. Maybe there's a lesson to be learnt from the movie: people can only survive in a wild hostile environment if they turn themselves into savages? For that, I'd rather watch ""Deliverance"" once more, thank you very much.",2006

10,"Lie With Me is 100% honest. The sex is over-hyped as being X-rated. The sex scenes are long, filmic and beautifully shot. The film is not really about sex, but about the psychological. The female lead enjoys sex and pleasure and shuts out love and intimacy until she meets the male lead who is very intimate and emotional. Not a scene is wasted. Supporting characters comment on relationships, loneliness, the body as something that is unsexy. The leads are physically beautiful, lovely to watch from a filmic sense, and give naked performances. There are people in everyday life like this and it's honest to see it up there on the big screen. A brilliant film.",2005
8,"I saw Lie with Me at another recent screening and I loved it. As a 30 something woman I felt that this movie really spoke to me. I got from it all the things I loved about Lost in Translation and the Sunset/Sunrise movies with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. Visually I think it is stunning, and the sex is really hot, but never gratuitous or porn-like. The supporting characters are strong as well and nicely developed in very economical scenes. The film never drags and there is not a single wasted frame. Eric Balfour smolders and I totally bought Lauren Lee Smith's journey of self-discovery. I highly recommend this film  Hope it gets released soon!",2005
9,"This is one of the most realistic portrayals of what it is like to be a woman who is sitting on the fine line between sex and love. Can you truly have both? Can you love someone and have great sex? I loved how this film captures the magnetism between two people.The heat, passion and possibility of love derived from attraction. The fact that sometimes you don't see love until it's too late. When you have it do you truly appreciate it? It also makes you see the addiction of those feelings, of being complete yet helpless in the arms of another and never wanting that feeling to stop. The main characters did a great job and had awesome on screen chemistry. One of the best love stories I've seen that wasn't like a ""chick flick"". If you have seen this movie already you might want to see the following titles: Wicker Park Or Love Me If You Dare (french film). Both of these movies deal with the Closeness and Connection between lovers that were probably kismet.Minus the rawness of sexual activity.",2006
10,"Probably one of the most honest depictions of the contemporary urban relationship dilemma to hit the big screen in this(or any other) year. Lauren Lee Smith delivers a performance that is, to quote David Spanner, Vancouver Province, ""a performance that's likely to be as good as any you'll see from a Vancouver actor - make that any actor - this year"". I couldn't agree more. The picture unfolds as a dark, yet very real glimpse into the life of a young, promiscuous,and emotionally challenged woman. Lauren Lee Smith was perfectly cast in an extremely challenging role that required not only an understanding of the ""dark side"" of modern relationships, but a clear ability to approach the character of ""Leila"" with honesty, courage and a sense of honesty that transcends most films in this genre.",2005
7,"There I was, lying in bed, finished the end of The Tonight Show looking for something to watch. When I read the description of the movie showing Lauren Lee Smith - I automatically thought about Lara from The L Word. I always wanted to see more of her (other than The Last Kiss). She's so beautiful and delicate so it was very interesting see her play this role. The chemistry between her and Eric Balfour was hot and naughty, but also romantic. It seems to me that she really had to let her guard down to play this role and I thought she was superb. Also, I no longer see Eric Balfour as Milo from 24 anymore, he has a nice body and booty. I recommend this film for just about anyone who is tired of the same old boring and predictable love scenes. This move is far from the norm in the department.",2007
10,"This movie is the best thing i've seen come out of Canada in awhile. It shows Toronto beautifully, in a way I've never seen in a film before. I think it is a very honest portrayal of women and sex. Not all women, but the women who cannot grasp what love is in relation to sex. This movie is entirely about love, and I think everyone's ridiculous obsession over the sexual content is underestimating the story. Everyone should see this film, it needs our support, and not just because you see sex, inside and out. You should see it because it explores love in a way that has never been captured on screen before. It explores love as something that is slow and developed and tangled up somewhere, as the main character struggles with the idea of its existence. This film could not have worked without the two main actors, who made this movie what it is.",2005
7,"I was truly surprised by the emotional depth and haunting quality of this film, which could easily have felt merely cheap and tawdry because of the abundant nudity and almost explicit sex that dominates it. The excellence of the performances, however, acts as a counterbalance to the sexual titillation. ",2006
5,"I liked the characters in this film and the actors playing them. But the truth is this film falls short in its effort to examine sex addiction vs. the complexity of love and relationships. I suppose it is easy to dismiss this work as a well produced soft porn flick. It seems to want to be much more. The problem is the characters are not all that well developed. We do not know what the two principal characters find in each other that will transcend their heavy breathing. They say they love each other eventually, but who knows why? Frankly I have know idea what the lead female character has to offer in terms of substance. At least the male character is seen reading Steppenwolf and not the cliff notes version, either. So I guess we can deduce he has depth and intelligence. The female lead, however, seems to work in photo developing shop as a clerk. Yet she has quite a varied wardrobe which she somehow is able to afford. That's about it in terms of her personality and depth. But they do have attractive bods and I must guiltily admit I enjoyed that. If the sex scenes were edited out, the theater would be empty half way through any screening!!!",2006

1,"OK, if you can get past the bonerack of a woman and Mr. Shaved Chest Hair who seriously looks like Jimmy Hill of BBC Match of The Day fame (think Mandrake the magician), this movie is trying to be more profound that it really is. Face facts, this is not a good porn film and not a good love story because it tries too much to be both. Basically, any movie with voice-over narration you know is in trouble because it means the story needs explanation that pictures and the actors' words cannot convey. Take away the narration and you maybe would have a half-decent fillum as then it would be left more to your own imagination as to why the woman is basically messed up.",2006
4,"There are too many wrong attempts to make the pornography look artistic. If you want to make a movie with only a few constraints, then there should be something that could turn the viewer on. It was sex with no real sex, and it can be noticed. When I watched the movie, I wasn't really enjoying it. Even though it lasted 90 minutes, it seemed to me that it lasted much longer. Similar scenes made it boring. It is not an erotic movie, it is not a porn, and it is definitely not an artistic movie, although the director tried to mix all of the three things. An unsuccessful attempt, I must say. The actors did not act that good. She failed in trying to look seductive and horny on the movie, and I had no impression that she was really f****d up. Finally, the happy-ending makes it look too mushy and it spoils everything that was made until then.",2007
8,"I really liked this film, and can't figure out exactly why. I wasn't interested in the sexual side of things (or the ""emotional journeys"" of the characters), but I know that that was pretty much 90% of the content. Although as far as sex scenes go, I thought they (well, the ones with David and Leila) were fantastic. They seemed to convey that choke-on-your-breath emotion rather than just have two bodies vigorously bumping uglies. I loved the soundtrack, and not just the music - the atmospheric track really made me feel, well, the atmosphere! Does anyone know where this was shot? I could just feel that warm, thick, hazy breeze, especially on the sidewalk in the late afternoon, and in David's room in the mornings with the fans blowing and the curtains billowing. I loved his loft. Maybe it's just the mood I'm in, but I was completely absorbed by this film and feel like I've been in another place for the past hour or so; somewhere warm, young and full of passion.",2006

10,"This film is a great work of art. The actors are splendid. The cinematography is flowing, sensual and erotically charged as under the director the audience is drawn inexorably into the vapour of love and sexuality that is the nature of the story. The minimal use of words does not in any way minimize the language of acting as the movie balances movement and physical acting. Comments that somehow feel that there needs to be a great deal of dialogue in order to communicate subtle feelings and ideas need to see this film again as it is multilevel and subtle. It is a modern work that has engaged this viewer four times so far and I still find more and more to think about. It is an inspiringly great film and perfect in every way. One of the finest films ever created in Canada...or any where else.",2007
3,"This movie had some titillating moments but was generally a waste of time. The male lead came across as a complete neanderthal which made it difficult to understand why the female lead was so obsessed with him. The two lead characters were not very likable which in and of itself doesn't make for a bad movie but there is little reason given in this film as to how they turned out this way or why we should care about what happens to them. The only moments in the film that provided any depth into either of the lead characters were when they were with their fathers. Unfortunately, those moments were far too few though. This movie was about the explicit sex more than anything else and that is not a formula for a compelling movie.",2006

7,"As a reader of the comics, I was really excited to finally see a movie about my favourite characters. I've learned that a FF film was in ""development hell"" for some decades, so when it finally came out, obviously I rushed to the theater. And, I was not disappointed at all. Of course it's not as good as X-Men 2 or Spider-Man (the original, with Tobey Maguire), but it's good for what it aims to be: a sci-fi/action movie about comic book characters. You have to understand that the Fantastic Four are not as popular as other heroes, like Iron Man i.e., besides, their stories always covered the most strange, bizarre, far out things imaginable. And, because they are a family, there are many corny moments in the movie, but the comics too have those moments, then you just have to ""let it go"", to really enjoy the story. Overall, it's a very decent movie about very decent people. Relax, and enjoy the ride!",2015
7,"Fantastic Four is one of the last superhero films, that I can recall, that wasn't insufferably bleak or incredibly serious to a point where any shred of humor was seen as obtuse to the film's narrative. Yes, Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy is an indisputable breakthrough in superhero films, but it also made the seriousness of superhero films standard, something that would follow into the late 2000's and early 2010's as Marvel built up The Avengers. Fantastic Four reminds of the quirkiness superhero films were once predicated upon, and while it may get a bit too corny at times, and its focus can never really settle, it's also a very commercial film that satisfies on some level of entertainment when it gives every card in its deck a fair time to shine.",2015

This movie and its sequel, ""Rise of the Silver Surfer"" are 20th Century Fox productions.

10,"This film was well put together, fun, and didn't take itself at all seriously. I am not sure where the negative hype comes from, but I find when a good film gets bad reviews, that means most people just didn't get it. In this case, perhaps from the last few comic book films that attempted to ""mean something,"" I think people forgot how to enjoy themselves. Laden with kitsch and tongue-in-cheek humor, this movie embraces that it comes from a comic book and allows itself to be big and a little silly. Yes, Jessica Alba wears an impossibly tight jumpsuit. Yes, the Human Torch is so slick and charming that, if you met him in real life, he'd get a solid smack for his arrogance. But this isn't real life, people, in case you forgot-this is the Marvel Universe, where clothes are tight and the dialog...isn't. Who cares? This movie is so fun that you wish these people did exist and would take some media focus off the jerks that are in the public eye.",2005

Let me start by saying I'm not a regular Fantastic Four reader, but I am a huge superhero fan and I've been reading comic books and watching superhero movies since the mid seventies.

5,"Well, you weren't expecting greatness, were you? Regardless of what the wider public might be expecting from Fantastic Four, in internet circles it's been earmarked as the potential stinker amidst a promising summer since the first details leaked online. Unlike successful superhero franchises like X-Men and Spider-man, there's no respected director and no attempt to give the film a thematic depth or real world resonance. Where they had acting heavyweights, Fantastic Four has a couple of notable talents from successful TV series and a couple of almost-stars, with broad appeal but little charisma to bring to the mix. So the first question you might want answered is, ""Is it awful?"" Thankfully, no. Fantastic Four is simple, rather hollow, occasionally boring and then it's over. But it's hard to deny that, in places, it's also fairly entertaining.",2005

4,"FF was slow, clichéd, and dull. The special effects were fine, but you had to wait until the final fight scene to see them. The first 80 minutes were all very typical, very obvious, and very boring character development. All of the ""emotional"" moments were telegraphed from a mile away, and used dialog repeated a thousand times in other films. There was absolutely no deviation from the standard action-movie formula, this movie was as boring as Elektra. I did not go and see FF expecting ""Gone with the Wind"", but nor did I go to see the incredibly lame and dumbed-down script. I urge you to click on the ""Memorable Quotes"" link in IMDb for this movie, and you will see that none of them are at all memorable. Most are groaners. This movie was one giant cliché from start to finish.",2006

The Fantastic 4 is a great movie!!! Especially for people who are too young to remember the comic books or the show!!! I remember when I was 9 years old, The Fantastic 4 used to be on late night on Cartoon Network. That was the only time I remember hearing about them or seeing them on a main stage. ",2005

As the self-proclaimed ""World's Greatest Comics Magazine"", the Fantastic Four are anything but in this adaptation directed by Tim Story (Barbershop); amidst these other hero films, the Fantastic Four should be ashamed. Where does the film go wrong? The budget was in place, the casting was not terrible and there was plenty of great source material (decades of comics) to work with. Even the director and editors seem to have done decently worked around what seems to be the film's main failure: the lack of any engaging plot.

Everything else I've seen so far has been pretty heavy and dark - this movie is fun and a great time. Jessica Alba is HOT HOT HOT. And I love Chiklis from The Shield - he is awesome as The Thing. My girlfriend loves Julian McMahon - and he was good as Doom. The best was Johnny Storm - he really surprised me. I think we'll be seeing more of this guy. I didn't know much about the Fantastic 4 before I went in - and I now I'm definitely into the characters. And the effects are great. ,2005

It was a major disappointment to see that there was barely any action/violence whatsoever it was mostly the 4 trying to figure out their powers and them arguing! The plot of this movie states ""Five friends get special powers after being exposed to harmful space ray things, then they have to save the from Dr. Doom"", but really they are barely any fight scenes at all with Dr. Doom and when there is it's not that spectacular! And, they don't even use their powers that much like I said it's basically them just arguing with each other! Anyways, this movie was a great disopointmeant i give it 3 out of 10.",2005

These are not only the most complex characters I've ever seen in a major super hero movie, they're a group of characters who are so well written and full of small, personal moments that they transcend their four-color origins and become living, breathing people whom have pasts, presents and futures. You really feel that they are a family and, by the end of the film, you feel like a part of that family. This is a remarkable feat for an origin film. It beats the first installment of any hero flick I can think of including Superman and Spider-Man.",2005

Brenda Lee Johnson is an outstanding interrogator with a background of being difficult to work with but achieving great results. However, her personal life is a mess. She is hired from Atlanta to head LAPD's Priority Crimes Unit for those high profile crimes that need a resolution and need it quickly. Tensions arise immediately. Her brusque style makes her own people want to transfer away, her boss is a former lover who dumped her and she manages to make many more enemies than friends. The crimes are formula enough that you can probably figure out whodunit before you get to the climax but it's the characters and relationships that sell the show and make it worth watching. Not only is Kyra Sedgwick giving the performance of her life in this series but she has a terrific supporting cast that gives the series heart. The ability of the writers to also give us some great comic lines keeps the show teetering at times from comedy to drama. The first season is already out on DVD. Watch it from the first episode to the last, in order, and you can see why this show has become the most watched show in basic cable history.",2006
10,"I am loving this series and it is the only show on TV right now that I really hate to miss. Brenda Lee Johnson is such a refreshing character. She has some slight skeletons in her closet, but has moved on to her new job and is getting it done with intense efforts, despite some members of her team being less than welcoming. Her love interest is hot and I certainly hope this continues and heats up during this second season. Fritz, I hope, will have a stronger part in this season and their relationship will heat up. He is very caring and thoughtful and hopefully Brenda will appreciate him and not mess this up. I would love to see their relationship be portrayed as healthy and happy--not like all the other junk on TV. I bought the First Season DVD set and haven't gotten tired of watching them. All of the plots have been suspenseful and interesting--the twists are super. Good writing--hope it lasts.",2006
10,"A recent episode called ""Maternal Instincts"" was such a tear-jerker. Brenda really showed her true colors - a caring and compassionate person.

It was a brilliant piece of acting and writing for the entire cast.",2009

Brenda's quick wit and obsessive personality is both endearing and annoying, and it is for this reason that she is such a brilliant and compelling character. I also love the show because it is funny (watching Johnson's staff react to her quirkiness is a trip), it makes you think, and the story lines are usually always excellent. I also enjoy how the show delves deeper into the intragroup dynamics than your typical crime solving show. I look forward every week to The Closer. It is by far my favorite show in TV right now!",2006

Kyra Sedgwick is great as Brenda Johnoson a real true southern belle from Atlanta, GA with both charm, wit, grace, and intelligence who starts a new life in Los Angeles as a chief deputy detective. Each episode Brenda always is very tough on each crime and murder case she works she's tough as nails in the interview asking tough questions to suspects. Brenda also is very witty and smart when looking for clues upon the crime scene her investigative work is hands on, but underneath it all she never losses her southern charm and nice gentle ways. Her love life is off and on but sometimes romance with an FBI agent is shown. She's certainly a tough woman cracking L.A.'s most bloody and tough cases with hard work and determination, her habit is a bad sweet tooth! I just love the way Kyra speaks and portrays Brenda so well with a deep and thick southern drawl a real twang of talent!

She's very good at solving odd murder cases and getting a confession from the criminal. She's not so great at the rest of her life. As the story develops we watch her weave her job and her very messy personal life with intelligent, interesting and occasionally funny results.

1,"I saw Hostel tonight with a crowd that was very receptive to the experience. Mine was more hostile. The film opens like a teen sex comedy. We are meant to identify with three young guys, who's idea of fun is getting high and having sex with prostitutes. This first section is littered with naked women, in what might just be the least sexy presentation of naked women anywhere. One can sense director Eli Roth and his cronies giving each other high fives off-camera, much like the silhouetted threesome early on in the film, as they pay surgically enhanced women to take their clothes off.

1,"It's not scary. It's not funny. It's not stylish. It's not suspenseful, exciting, thrilling or chilling in any way. It's not intelligent enough to even be viewed as some warped social commentary. It's not ambitious enough to do anything other than present gratuitous T&A and gore in the dullest manner imaginable. Hell, it's not even entertaining. What it really is is an exercise in being completely and utterly pointless aside from presenting violent scenarios and nude women in third world countries with unlikely silicone enhanced bodies. The ""plot"" involves a trio of students (two Americans and a foreigner) vacationing in Eastern Europe who eventually stumble upon a pay-to-slay type business that specializes in making your sickest dreams come true (i.e. customers paying a high price to get to slaughter a real live person). And I am using the world ""eventually"" because it takes around an hour for this movie to get to the real horror content. First we have to sit through an excruciating hour dedicated to the juvenile frat boy antics of characters who stay wasted on booze and drugs and pay hookers for sex. A whole hour of this crap.",2006

I certainly didn't expect it from this one. As much as I loved Cabin Fever, I'm not blind to the shortcomings of its script.

Or maybe Americans still think that Eastern Europe is some kind of wild land, the land of poverty, devastation and murder, and it's dangerous to be even near those places.

He tries to cheer up his friend Josh (Derek Richardson), an aspiring author, by telling him that ""life experience"" is grist for the writer's mill.

6,"Recently I picked up Hostel at my local movie store and decided to give it a try. I finished watching it and had very mixed feelings. First off, this film is not nearly as gory and disgusting as advertised. It is although, very graphic, and NOT for the squeamish, I just expected more out of it. The pop-up scares aren't effective and the first half of the movie is all soft-core porn. So what makes this movie a decent horror movie? The physiological scares. That is what got to me. The overwhelming feeling of being tied and up and tortured to death. Having no escape. For that was very effective and stomach curdling. The sex and nudity was all not needed, but for people looking for that kind of stuff, it's all here. The acting was pretty good. No bad performances. Hostel is a kind of movie where you'll either love it or hate it. But overall, an OK horror film. Not my favorite, but not terrible.",2007
7,"This movie really could have been so much more. The idea would have been much better off with someone who actually wanted to make a decent movie, instead of a porno gorefest. The first half of the movie consists almost entirely of sex, talk of sex, drugs, and talk of drugs. Instead of, hey, maybe develop the characters a little so the audience might care about them and make their plights a little more tense, the filmmakers decided to have a lot of party scenes and annoying main characters acting like idiots until, uh oh, we didn't plan on being tortured, oops! The sad thing is, there are hints of something more intelligent beneath the surface, but the surface is piled so high with garbage that it's lost. For example, while at a sex club (wow, original!) one of the characters mentions something along the lines of ""paying to do anything you want to a person,"" of course he means sexually, but we know the basic plot of the movie involves the same concept with death and torture instead of sex. One of the characters is supposed to seem like a nice guy, but still never really develops enough for us to care. The main character has absolutely no depth other than a childhood story and his shallow interaction with his friend. The last half or so of the movie actually starts to gain momentum, and the first half not been an entire waste of film, I could have walked away with more than a feeling that I'd just watched 15 minutes of an okay movie, and an hour and fifteen minutes of porn and senseless gore. Sadly enough, the idea of this movie was put into the wrong hands. A little less than halfway through, my friend turned to me and said, ""Maybe I picked up the wrong movie..."" to which I replied, ""Yeah, I think you got Eurotrip by accident."" I am baffled as to why they decided to write the first half like they did. I guess I was hoping for something deeper. Don't watch this expecting anything special, be ready for lots of nudity and lots of incredibly disturbing gore mixed randomly, the two not even seeming to fit like they would in a slasher flick.",2006
1,"My English is not very good (and i'm sorry for that), but this ''movie''is one of the stupidest I ever seen! Low budget movie with stupid, simple and awful story about 3 guys going to Bratislava (capital of Slovakia) to have some fun with slovak horny girls and they get killed by unearthly brutal people of small country Slovakia. This movie shows Slovakia like some kind of backward, poor and dirty country. If you know Slovakia, you know that this movie was filming in Czech Republic(there is a lot of signs with czech language on it, also the language they speak is czech), which is lovely country with beautiful history. You can see kids robbing these guys on the street by daylight!?What is that? This is not Kosovo, Afganistan or Iraq. They are not in the war or something. You should check some websites about this. Everybody who knows something about Eastern Europe, and saw this movie, know that this is degradation of this two countries and the producer Eli Roth is moron!!! It is a shame, that they earn money on this lame, full of lies rude stupidity!",2006
1,"This movie was not only laughable, but morally degrading and at some parts repulsive to watch. The only reason that I went to see this movie is because I respect Quentin Tarantino's work in other movies, and just because his name was on this one, I caved. Some of the scenes were so STUPID that I found myself laughing at the screen. One scene containing bloody floor and a chainsaw to a leg was purely comical. Another scene where a one-eyed Asian girl jumps in front of a train after viewing her deformed face had me crying. The large amounts of nudity were also not needed and only added to the lack of morality in this film. I would not see this movie ever again and I would encourage others to do the same.",2006
4,"I like a rip-roaring horror movie as much as the next guy, but this one just didn't do it for me. It certainly felt like it hit all the necessary marks, from nudity and dismemberment to bloody revenge, but at the conclusion, it just felt like eating cotton candy - no real nutritional value, just a sense that I had satisfied some of my prurient appetite without any logical payoff.",2005
1,"Something has gone horribly wrong. I'm not sure what Eli Roth and Quentin Tarentino were thinking when they put this crap together, but it's a laughable attempt at a shocking horror film. It wasn't as violent as Saw, it wasn't as tense as the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake, and it's filled with more ridiculous horror clichés than I could list in 1,000 words on IMDb. To have a preview that warns squeamish people with bad hearts to stay away from the theaters, there were a lot of people in my theater LAUGHING. Throughout the entire film. That pretty much sums things up about this one. A laughable attempt at being shocking. Just track down the original Japanese film instead. Or watch ""Audition"". Or ""Ichi the Killer"". You'll be better off. The other worst movie that I've seen in a theater? Wes Craven's THEY. And I'm not sure which of the two is worse.",2006
9,"I am not a big ""gore"" fan but I love a tense horror movie in which the director creates vivid images in your mind. This movie has both. I was a little surprised how good the story was and how good the actors (all of which were pretty much no-names)were. There is a scene by one of the lead male actors which will stay in your head well after the movie. I watched it at the TIFF at the 12:45pm show and I was at the edge of my seat. The plot was well-developed although I thought that the Director shouldn't have revealed the protagonist as early as he did in the movie and could have developed his reasons for doing what he did more fully. The ending was very good, but didn't hold up to the suspense and action immediately preceding it - the Director said he had a few other endings but felt screened audiences didn't like the other alternatives. In any event, I actually found myself turning away twice in the movie (I never do). There is some major disturbing stuff in this movie and Roth achieved his objective of making the scariest, sickest movie I have seen. What I did like was although the stuff was sick, it was actually plausible - that's the scary part. Sort of like what Friedkin did with the Excorcist - the scary part was that it made you think this crap was possible. Highly recommend this for the gore/horror fans, but I have a feeling that the studio distributor will demand cuts to the film. If it does get cut significantly, I am not sure if you will feel the same impact, but I guess time will tell. Roth mentions it will gain wide theatrical release around November.",2005
8,"What is it with horror movies these days that believe that simply throwing buckets of cheap gore on a body equals scary? Cringing doesn't necessarily mean fear if it is ridiculous enough to be unbelievable. Movies like Saw have come close, but still never really achieve true fear. Hostel is the latest attempt at the gore flick, and for what it's worth, it is the movie that Saw wanted to be.",2006
8,"'Hostel' directed by Eli Roth and produced and introduced by Quentin Tarantino is not easy too watch. It's a horror movie about a group of teens traveling to Eastern Europe whose trip for fun and sex turns in a trip of horror, when they fall victims to a gang of who attract tourists into becoming victims of a sadistic torture_per_pay theater. The difference between other many movies of the genre is that the introduction that looks much like a American_teen_trip_to_Europe film develops gradually in what seems to be a very realistic rendition of the post-Communist Easter Europe turned into a big circus of horror. The setting is much more realistic and credible than in the classic American movies of the genre, and the resulting violence and torture scenes exceed the usual limits. The film is well made and well acted, but while you admire the directors and actors skills you just with that they were spent into making some more entertaining, easier to watch and meaningful movie.",2006
1,"Eli Roth has done the impossible: he somehow made rampant nudity and bloody gore as boring and insipid as humanly possible. The characters are all lame and no one could possibly care about them, the supposed torture scenes aren't even that 'torturous', and the plot is incredibly dumb and insulting. The ending makes no sense at all, we never get any idea of the motivations behind the killers, and the main killer is as scary as Clay Aiken. And how can you run a business about torturing people, hire seemingly dozens of henchmen and skanks to lure tourists, and no one find out about it? Even with the one scene showing that the cops are somehow involved wasn't enough for me to believe that NO ONE WOULD MENTION AT SOME POINT THE FACT THAT THERE WERE DOZENS OF PEOPLE BEING KILLED AND TORTURED. What kind of idiot would have a business like that and have this many people involved in it? And the ending with the Japanese girl was just a lame excuse to rip-off 'Suicide Club', as it had no reason for existing other than that. After seeing this Eli Roth guy make movies, it's clear it's who you know in Hollywood and not much else.",2006
9,"I was one of those people that hated everything about Cabin Fever. I wasn't anticipating Eli Roth's next film, but when I heard the Internet buzz around Hostel, and found it was showing at the 2005 TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival), I decided to check it out.",2005
8,"I enjoyed the movie more than most commentators it appears, and not just cause it was bloody and had lots of boobies. The first 20 mins are just full of titties titties titties and yes, there are plenty of homophobic remarks that make us (or at least me) not so supportive our alleged heroes. but after the titties, the real fun begins. --SPOILER -- The torture scenes are graphic, but not as bad as I thought they'd be - they aren't relentless and overdone, but have just the right piquant tastes of grotesque and terror. The scene with the kid pleading for his life in German was very effective - thought maybe i should pick up some German for situations like these. as for the other commentators complaining that the characters were jerks - that's actually part of what makes this movie so good - Usually it's the nice, earnest, innocent hero/heroine goes through hell but always makes it out alive - being rewarded by fate or god or whatever for being good. but here the nice(st) fellow of the three bites it, in a bad way, leaving us to think we've got no one to root for. left with the jackass, we're forced us shift our alligence to a less likable hero - that is unless you're rooting for the torturers. Nice twist really. --SPOILER -- What really did it for me and probably why i give this movie such a high rating are the revenge scenes. In most movies, our beleaguered hero/heroine escapes, we have the one last scare and the hero/heroine kills the bad thing and then we all go home. But we all kinda feel hollow, like the bad thing's death just wasn't enough to make up for all the crap our hero/heroine had to go through. Here, in Hostel- the last 10 mins outta nowhere change from horror into a revenge film and it's quite satisfying, like a big ole bacon cheeseburger. Everyone that brought our characters to their lowly states gets it and gets it good. I wish I had a pack of wild orphaned gypsy children to do my bidding for bubble gum.",2006

6,"I have to admit, that i was expecting the forth edition to the American Pie series, with its almost complete absence of original characters (Except for Jim's Dad and the Sherminator) to be dreadful. Thankfully its actually pretty good, Tad Hilgenbrinck (Matt Stifler) pulls off an incredible performance as the Stifmeister's younger brother; its like Steve Stiflers back (really he's that good) ",2006
7,"After hearing quite a few negative comments/remarks/reviews about this film, I had somewhat lowered expectations.",2006
5,"The charm and the success of the previous 3 American Pie movies were its characters. ""American Pie: Band Camp"" focuses mainly on just one character, Matt Stiffler, the younger brother of Steve Stifler who we all know from the previous 3 American Pie movies. Tad Hilgenbrink really isn't bad as the new Stifmeister and he impersonates his older 'movie brother' pretty well and convincing but he however isn't given exactly wonderful material to work with. It also is too hard and too much for him to carry this entire movie on his own. The movie could had surely used some better sidekicks and other characters to help and make this movie a better one.",2005
7,"I have not seen all the AP films, so I just enjoyed this for what it was - quickly paced, light and fun. There is some real talent in this young cast and the sequence with the clarinet (?) or oboe - not sure - was hurt-yourself-laughing funny. The cast weren't all just blonds, and there was a story line with a multi-pierced tattooed girl which was a nice break in the stereotypes of what is ""hot."" The tight script and even handed directing elevates what could have been unbearable to a well - made enjoyably watchable film which had me in tears with some of the silly, but smart, set-ups. ",2005
8,"I must say I like all the American Pie movies, but without the original cast I was a bit skeptical. This movie has all the crude humor and laughs that the others had. I enjoyed the character of Matt Stifler although I think they could have gone even farther with the making of the videos. Overall a very good teen flick that anyone can enjoy. I liked this better than most comedies lately and I hope that Matt and Elyse can return in ""American Family"" since Michelle was pregnant in this one. I think that would be a great way to end the series. I'm hoping that people give this movie a chance and realize that although the Stifler character is over the top, the movie does send a message. It's a funny and sometimes disgusting way to do so but definitely a worthy one indeed.",2005
7,"It's not some great masterpiece of cinematography, of course, but the actors are acting well, the script , even it is as cliché as they get, it well written and the lead character makes a great Stifler act. I mean, I even wondered if the actor playing the original Stifler's brother is his actual brother!",2008
8,"Heaps of dirty jokes, hidden video, and more breasts than a KFC-catered frat house? You betcha. What you'll see if you watch it, though, is that under the boobies this movie has a whole lot of heart. There's real character development, a touching love story, and for the giggling teen in all of us, many, many unapproved uses for musical instruments. Add a hilarious cameo from original Pie cast-member Eugene Levy, and you've got that rare movie your beer buddies and your girlfriend might actually be able to agree on. What had this sensitive young woman getting the ""aw that's so sweet"" sniffles? The only bathroom stall masturbation scene you'll ever see that's more ""Aaaaaw"" than ""Eeeeew"". Play it again, Stiffmeister.",2005
8,"After watching the previous 3 American Pie movies, i was eagerly awaiting the next installment...and as usual i was expecting the pointless storyline, heaps of laughs and a reasonable detachment from the characters.",2005
8,"The best part of this whole movie is seeing The Sherminator again! He's now a guidance counsellor at High School and he is the one who sentences poor old Matt Stifler to summer camp! Apart from the Sherminator, Jim's dad is the only other original cast member to make a reappearance but he is really funny in it and the jokes are really well orchestrated. It doesn't work all of the time, but what teen sex comedy does? The point is it at least works half the time, with one in two jokes actually being funny and that is more than you can expect from this kind of movie. Nowhere newar up to the standard of American Pie 1 or 2, but easily an improvement on American Wedding!",2006
10,"I walked into the video shop one day to get a few DVDs.. I glanced down and saw ""American Pie: Band Camp"". I thought ""Wow, a new American Pie?"". I was pretty sceptical but got it nevertheless.",2008
4,"Whoever owns the rights to ""American Pie"" is being pretty capitalistic about it. You can name twenty characters Stifler if you want, it doesn't change the fact that this is a rather uninspired effort to cash in which bizarrely works. You can judge it standing by itself, but just keep in mind it was never intended to stand by itself. So here Stifler's brother Matt (who's not even the same guy from ""American Pie 2"") is punished for pulling an on all levels pretty lame prank. The Sherminator meanwhile has become a school counselor and sends him to band camp, which as it turns out, currently employs Jim's Dad. It's like bad fan fiction came to life. So naturally he pulls more pranks on the rivals like, two. They get back at him like, once. The rest is filled up with very bothersome references to the actual ""American Pie""-movies, semi-naked chicks and extremely irritating love subplots including a horrendously clichéd nerd you just can't possibly side with. Add a last fifteen minutes that's like the Siberian prison edit of ""Family Matters"" and you start wondering why it's still somewhat enjoyable. Perhaps it's the presence of Eugene Levy in yet another movie he's too talented for. The sunscreen gag was pretty good too I guess. This ""American Pie presents"" crap needs to end though, even if you don't give any thought to how a movie can present anything, it's still a thorn in the eye to the franchise.",2008
1,What would happen if a retarded group of monkeys watched the first 3 American Pies and decided they'd like to make a fourth? American Pie: Bandcamp.,2005
10,"This was a very comedic movie. Sure, it wasn't the same as the first three. It had a lower budget and inexperienced actors, thats expected. If you were buying this movie for its excellent plot and great acting, you may want to reconsider your life. American Pie was never about these things. We all need to take a step back and see that the movie is funny, as much so as the others. Sure band camp doesn't have hot college councilors who hook up with the campers, but its American Pie, they can here. I think we all need to step back and see that this movie, while taking a slightly different approach, still delivered the same type of comedy as the first three, and in large quantities. That satisfies me.",2005
1,It's a shame after 3 great movies that this atrocity was made. Its just plain terrible. When I picked this movie up I actually had no idea that they even made a fourth movie. The entire cast has been recycled with the exception of Jim's Dad and the Shermanator.,2005
9,"Just had to comment on this movie. I love the high school comedies, and this one is no exception. I read some of the other comments and don't understand how someone could not find it funny. To me, it is right up there with the first 3 'Pie' movies...maybe better than the last 2! I would love to see a Band Camp 2. This movie had an actual message, but also all the other stuff you'd expect from the ""Pie Guys"".Tad's portrayal of Stifler was absolutely dead-on, the facial expressions, the mannerisms -- it was perfect. They left it wide open for a sequel, too. I can see it now...Matt and Elyse going to the prom, graduation, etc. Sure, it's predictable and been done before...but who cares?! It's funny, and that's what it's all about!!",2006
2,I love the American Pie movies. I think they set a new standard for teen comedy flicks. But this installment just does not cut it.,2005
10,"i love the series and this is a great sequel. good plot, good actors, and very funny. i was laughing most of the time. I wish there was a soundtrack to it because there is some great music in it. Tad is great as Matt's younger brother and looks just like Seann Scott. there's enough of stifler in him to make him funny and his antics in the beginning of the movie are great and stifler-worthy. Eugene Levy returns and is great. its not quite the same without Jim around, but he still cracks me up. the best part of the movie doesn't come too quickly and the ending wraps up the movie and the plot nicely. the return of the ""Shermanator"" adds a nice touch, although i would have liked to see more of the original characters other than Sherman and Jims dad. overall Ithough it was a great movie, and the unrated version is worth the money.",2005
1,"What a huge disappointment! I like the American Pie movies and specially the first two. I can't believe they were allowed to use the name American Pie for this movie. There are maybe to semi funny moments in the entire movie and after giving it more than a fair chance, I started fast forwarding through the second half of the movie. The ad for this movie was something like ""Hilarious and sexier than ever!"" It was no where near to being hilarious, more like painful I would say. And sure there are pretty girls in the movie, as you would have to have in a movie with a script this bad, to even get one person to watch it. None of the funny characters in the previous movies are present, but are replaced with one character (Stifler's little brother) who really isn't funny, just a poor copy of his brother, and all the other characters that aren't funny at all. I can feel that I'm getting annoyed just thinking about this movie again so I'm going to stop here.",2006
1,"As far as I can tell, there's one returning character from the first three movies. The actor cast for the lead role was terribly unconvincing, tried way too hard, and just plain wasn't right for the part. This unfunny piece of trash seemed more interested in following through with the predictable plot rather than creating humor. If you're a fan of the originals, do NOT see this flick. As in most teen comedies, there's nudity (well, at least in the unrated version). This film is more like a softcore porno with little comedy, rather than a comedy with little nudity. The characters are extremely cliché and are very shallow. The only ""character development"" to be found is the main character learning an ""important"" lesson. It just doesn't work. It's terrible.",2005

7,"American PIE PRESENTS BAND CAMP is a par above American WEDDING. Sure, some people will be disappointed because the only cast members from any of the other PIE movies are EUGENE LEVEY as JIM'S DAD and CHRIS OWEN as the SHERMINATOR. With that said, who better could of played Matt Stifler better than TAD HILGENBRINCK. This guy has got the whole stifler persona down to a T. Sure, it didn't have a huge theatrical release (did it have one at all?) but that doesn't make it a bad movie in anyway what-so-ever. There are some funny scenes in this film. One that really comes to mind is the scene where Matt Stifler has intercourse with a musical instrument and, unfortunately for him, his unmentionables get stuck. Also, the ending is a sappy one but this is still slightly better than American WEDDING. I can only hope that the good folks at UNIVERSAL will think about doing a movie in the franchise centering around EUGENE LEVY's character of JIM'S DAD, one of the funniest characters ever created.",2006

2,"This was the first of quite a few straight to DVD sequels in the American Pie franchise, and sadly, it is not a good start. Basically Steve Stifler's younger brother Matt Stifler (Tad Hilgenbrinck) keeps misbehaving at the school, he has to be punished by Chuck 'Sherminator' Sherman (Chris Owen) by being sent to Tall Oaks Band Camp to spend his time. At first he is obviously angry at the idea, but then he decides to buy a spy camera kit to get all the decent girls on camera. He especially wants to get the pretty Elyse (Arielle Kebbel) on video, but obviously when he is caught out, he realises his mistake. Also starring Rachel Veltri as Dani, Angela Little as Sheree and Omar Benson Miller as Oscar. While the amount of nudity and gross jokes (what all the sequels seem to rely on) is sort of okay, as an overall film it is just so boring, no laughs, no good performances, nothing new at all, don't bother with it. Pretty poor!",2005
10,"Very good storyline and this installment flows in neatly with the other installments of American Pie. The new debutant who acts as Matt Stifler, is such a great actor and has shown evidence that he has influenced and used Steve Stifler's personality. The sex scenes aren't as intense of the previous series, however there are good twists, lots of humour and the plot is so excellent. It's just one of those teen-movies with jokes, tricks, girls and boys, sex and a whole lot of partying. One of the best movies in the American Pie series. It's a pity that all the old characters have moved on however the new characters were just as good as the old ones.",2005

7,"Michael Bay has had his directoral ups and downs, but here in the big budget action realm, the director of the excellent The Rock seems right at home. This time, Bay welds the action to a solid, if somewhat unoriginal sci fi plot - which blends elements of Logan's Run, THX-1138 and Gattaca.",2007
5,"This movie starts off well. The plot in particular is very intriguing as is the question of whether it is ethical to clone people for their organs. And this question of ethics is what is used to draw the viewer in. So i was surprised that about 30 mins of the movie was dedicated to developing this theme and the rest was just a string of action sequences. Yes, for what it was this movie was an entertaining action flick. But it really could've been much more than that, in the hands of a decent director. Seriously, why does Michael Bay get to keep on making movies? All the cast were excellent in their roles, but you could tell they were crying out for a better script. The movie seemed shallow and bereft of depth although it had a good plot and theme. If you're after action then this movie will keep you entertained for 2 hours, yet if you thought this was going to be a sci-fi, makes you question humanity sort-of-movies, then you'll be disappointed by The Island.",2006
7,"I have every movies of Michael Bay, and I got to say  this is probably his best. Though the story is nothing new and it has a lots (loads) of resemblances of his previous work; I really enjoy watching it. But it actually the actors (Ewan and Scarlett) who made this movie so interesting.",2005
7,"I liked ""The Island"" quite a bit due for two reasons: a depiction of the future which wasn't too ""over the top"", which was refreshing, coming from Bay, and that the leads were very effective at portraying their characters. McGregor, from his acting, and Johansson, from her open, fresh expression. There could have been a little more exploration of the cloning question, and I felt the action was, while visually beautiful, mundane. The score was outstanding, the theme beautifully matching the opening to the film. Pity there wasn't more of it. Sean Bean, to those used to his villainous work in ""Patriot Games"", and ""Goldeneye"", was a little weak, but due to writing, not his thespian skills. And what's a Micheal Bay or Cohen Brothers movie without Steve Buscemi? His character was relatively weak, with no real motivation behind his actions in the film. Djimon Hounsou has a pretty good part. Nice to see him carry a substantial role. One good reason to see the film: great visuals, good looking people with consistent positive ideals. Pretty to watch.",2005

3,"Ouch. I knew this movie would never live up to the hype as soon as I saw the trailer and recognized the plot as a direct steal from ""Parts:The Clonus Horror"" a movie a gleefully laughed at on Mystery Science Theater 3000 some years ago. Although this remake has been jazzed up and given spiffy special effects and a huge budget for blowing things up the story is just as badly thought out. The plot leaks like a sieve,life for the clones is un-fulfilling and is causing psychological problems for some (meds anyone?), the huge number of people working behind the scenes to keep things secret (that many people can't keep a secret, lowly wage slaves least of all), holographs to display the ""contaminated"" world (they are UNDERGROUND, just tell them that), and of course the fact that at least 50 or more people were killed in the chase scenes, no one would ever notices that in LA. Sigh but worst was the ending, it was so ripped from ""Logan's Run"" I expected to see Peter Ustinov waving at the clones.

In the beginning, we get the message that life, any life, is precious, then all the bad guys (even the not-so-bad guys) just start dropping like bricks, and we're supposed to feel happy when THAT happens. The initial chase scenes were great, but as time went by, they started to drag and then just became pointless.",2005

When I first saw the previews for this film I thought that it looked cool, but I never expected it to be as good as it was. Don't be surprised if this movie wins any awards by the end of the year. This movie is very unique while at the same time reminds you of Logun's Run. The score is well-paced and really sets the tone for the movie. The chase sequences are absolutely incredible and will have you on the edge of your seat. Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson are perfect in their roles and make the movie movie seem very real.

Has no knowledge of sex, yet as soon as they get into the real world they are all over each other. They play up the jokes about them being fish out of water and not knowing the most basic things about the modern world - like what it means when someone is taking a dump, or in the can....... Yet he knows how to drive. The ending was so predictable you could have left half way through and known what happened. They fall in love and kill the evil Dr. BORING!",2005
6,"All in all not a bad movie, but there is not one new idea in it. A rehash and sampling of at least a dozen other movies. From small stolen ideas..Blade Runner: (false memories implanted in a replicant), to huge stolen ideas: to The Clonus Experiment (clones grown for replacement body parts, who learn the truth and escape to expose the real truth), to The Matrix: huge caverns of growing bodies, Not to mention Logan's Run..etc etc etc.. The list is endless. But it is done with flair, directed and paced well. The actors are quite good, the effects are quite good, so its worth seeing, as long as you are new to the genre and wont see every plot point coming at you a mile away.",2005
3,"Ewan McGregor has worked with the likes of Tim Burton and Ridley Scott. Scarlett Johansson has been directed by the daughter of one of the greatest directors of all time in an Oscar-nominated movie. Steve Buscemi has frequently been on the set with perhaps the godfathers of independent film-making, and Sean Bean has experience with just about everyone in Hollywood. So I have to wonder what went through the minds of these performers as they headed from their trailer to the set each day to find out the latest use Michael Bay had for his $100 million budget. ""I should have read this script a little closer""? ""My agent is so fired for this""? ""At least I'm making a ton of money""? ""I wonder what we get to blow up today""? ",2005
10,"Constantine (2005) in my opinion is an underrated Comic Book Film and one of my favorite anticipated supernatural horror flicks of my life. Keanu Reeves and Rachel Weisz reunite in this flick, after 9.years later when they both made together Chain Reaction (1996) one of my favorite sci-fi action flick. Anyway beside End of Days (1999) with Schwarzenegger in the starring role, Constantine is the only supernatural horror film that I know and like. After just watching this film I must say is a far way million times better than overrated The Exorcist (1973) that everyone highly praises that film. I love this movie to death and it is my fifth favorite best Keanu Reeves movie. John Constantine is iconic character that I think that Keanu Reeves did impressive acting performance, including way better job than he did in movies he is doing this days.",2015
10,Context.,2017
10,"This movie was really great in my opinion. If you like the horror/sci-fi genre then this is definitely for you. The effects are great and the make-up is exceptional as well. Keanu and Rachel really compliment each other in the roles they are in. I wouldn't expect something phenomenal but this genre of movies is rarely gifted with such a insightfully plotted movie such as Constantine.The character build is great and the background of the characters isn't completely clouded which is awesome, there's no feeling of confusion when it comes to whats going on. It seems in some scenes the director was going for a certain emotion which made it feel awkward but the action and reactions are nice. Keanu really came across as tough doomed and uncaring, while Rachel came across as determined and brave. There is no reason to not give this movie a chance, if it seems like something you would like, i recommend seeing it. The concepts and setups aren't something of the usual nature so its a welcomed change of pace. I don't rate this 10/10 because is was astounding and mind shattering, a movie of the century, I rate it 10/10 because it was enjoyable and i have watched it many times without feeling tired of it. The score and soundtrack are great as well, providing some depth into certain scenes. The contrast and colors are good, although looking a little too dark in some scenes. The movie takes you to many places, so there is no feeling that you are in one place, sometimes I feel that movies that take place in the same space create a feeling of urgency, not so in Constantine. Some enjoyable aspects is the historical tie ins and use of terminology. All in all, this is an exceptional movie, it moves from scene to scene with little dragging in one spot, and has a great ending.",2005
8,"This is a fable...it's not supposed to be so rooted in reality that we scoff at the implausibilities and the plot holes... We're not watching it to say ""look at how that happened"" or ""why is it all happening here in L.A. when we have these worldwide problems"" or...whatever... It has to happen somewhere; either you buy off on the fable and get into the story or you flush it...",2005
10,And I loved it.,2005
9,"I've seen Constantine three times and I enjoy it more each time I watch it! It is truly well-done and extremely entertaining, and I can guarantee that if you like horror, suspense and/or fantasy you will love this movie! Keanu Reeves plays a very cool Constantine, who is a modern-day exorcist but most certainly not to be confused with a priest, as he has his issues and a burden of sins from his past that he carries with him. Constantine is a very realistic and human hero who is devoid of superpowers but has all the cool gadgets and the kick-ass attitude needed to survive in a world slowly being invaded by demons and scheming angels. He meets Angela (Rachel Wiesz) after she loses her sister, Isabel to the forces of evil. She comes to Constantine in search of an answer on where Isabel has ended up following her apparent suicide. Constantine journeys to other realms/dimensions in an attempt to get those answers, even paying a couple of visits to hell. Needless to say, with such a plot the special effects, acting, sets, script and even wardrobe have to be carefully conceived and executed to make it believable, and they are... in spades.",2006
9,"All the actors in it did an amazing job minus Shia LaBeouf who, as usual, did a crappy job in a crappy role. Gavin Rossdale has an excellent performance as Balthazar and plays the role to its fullest. Rachel Weisz also puts out an awesome performance. Heres where I will likely get flamed but...Keanu Reeves also played the part of Constantine to its fullest I believe. Many have said hes too ""Batman-ish"" however I disagree. Constantine is a man who knows hes doomed to spend eternity in hell. Anyone who's less giddy about it than Keanu acts in the movie would appear to be rather fake. I think he did a wonderful job and is still a great actor, even though he kind of flopped it in the second and third Matrix.",2005
10,"If you are a fan of Keanu Reeves then you'll love this movie. Of course, he plays a similar character to this other roles but so do most actors. I believe most actors are merely personalities and Keanu has a cool one at that.",2005
10,"Constantine is one more of those movies that are adapted from a comic series. Now, people in comics' stories often seem pretty wild in the eyes of watchers or readers. Just think of Batman. Isn't Gotham City crazy? Constantine, I think, is a most excellent picturisation of the comic stories. It is full packed with action, the story is quite entertaining, there is wit, the actors are amazing, the way of filming is great. Just watch these pictures and camera stills. Beautiful! Constantie is worth going to a movie theater. The pictures may blow you away. It is stunning.",2005
9,"""Constantine"" is a dark, yet dazzling film. A terrific story backed up by spectacular special effects and great cinematography pull us into a dark and dangerous world - a world where half-angels and half-demons whisper to us mortals as God and Satan use us as pawns in an apocalyptic game of chess. Cursed with ability too see these spirits, John Constantine finds himself right in the middle of this showdown.",2005
9,"Personally, this movie is really a memorable one to me. I was 15 when I watched it in theater. And totally stunned by the visuals and world of it.",2013
9,"Gosh, people spend so much time bashing Keanu Reeves. This film is actually quite good and the plot is quite good. Great special effects, enough religious creepiness to make to think, and a lot of action. Not quite as good as The Phophecy but damn close. Don't trust Keanu haters. It wouldn't matter how grand a film was, if he's in it they will trash it. Just rent the flick and judge for yourself. Yes, it's dark, and yes Keanu is wooden in his dialogue at times, but the movie is fantastic to watch. For anyone who has ever doubted religion, spirits, and our place in the world with them, then this is the movie to see. Great supporting cast, starting with Shia LeBouf who I like more and more with each role he takes on.",2005
8,"My first sort-of mistake was going to see Constantine at 11:30 A.M.; this would have been a much better experience in a nighttime atmosphere I feel. In fact, I'm thinking about going again this weekend at night.",2005
7,"I have to say, I went to see Constantine because Shia LaBeouf is one of my favourite actors. This may have made me biased before I even entered the cinema, but I thoroughly enjoyed this film anyway! The plot is a little hard to follow especially if you don't listen and watch carefully for the clues. It centers around John Constantine (Reeves) who helps ""save the world"" from demons. He's not the usual sort of superhero because he is very reluctant to fit into that kind of role. The supporting actors are very well cast, and Rachel Weisz deserves all the praise she gets for her part. Tilda Swinton as Gabriel portrays the angel perfectly as not quite male or female. The film presents interesting views about heaven, hell and death, it's very thought-provoking. In a way, Constantine reminded me of I,Robot because it has a male lead who meets a female lead, and also has LaBeouf as sidekick again. But other than that this was a good film, and I think I will buy or rent it on DVD when it comes out. Here's a tip: wait until the credits ends, there is an extra scene!",2005
9,"This is certainly one of the best religion/thriller movie ever. It's so full of creations and alternative stories based in reality and in the Bible, that you have the sensation it's an alternative world. Maybe that's why so many people hate Constantine, and many that love - like me.",2009
8,Despite what people say this film is actually quite good. Sure it had some flaws and the story kind of dragged on but the effects were very good and the acting (which is pretty amazing) didn't suck. Keanu wasn't as bad as he usually is and Rachel Weisz does a very good job with what I think is a well written part. The must annoying actor in the film is in my opinion not Keanu but Tilda Swinton. The actor who I felt brought most passion and enthusiasm to his role was Peter Stormare who obviously enjoyed playing Satan and the scenes with him are admittedly some of the most interesting in the film and even though he is only on screen for something like 5 - 10 minutes he should almost be credited as a main character thats how good he is.,2005
9,Though slightly Neo-Esq Keanu does an excellent job of portraying an extremely strong character in what for me was an engrossing film. ,2005
8,"this film was OK....it had an OK sort of storyline to it, and even had some good visuals in the forms of all the dead people, and how hell was portrayed as a parallel world i thought that was great...",2005
10,"One of my very favorite movies, I have watched ""Constantine"" numerous times and still appreciate it. Perhaps I enjoy it so much because I was raised Catholic and attended Catholic school -- the movie contains many religious themes that any former Catholic will enjoy and relate to. Old-school Catholics may not like this movie at all but anyone who has questioned beliefs (which this movie does not do)and has questioned God's Will or asked ""Why?"" or ""Why Me?"" is really going to like this movie! As I said this movie does not question beliefs but builds on them in a very cool way. I'm not sure a non-catholic can appreciate this entire aspect of the film though.",2006
4,"Keanu Reeves plays the title character in this adaptation of the cult DC/Vertigo comic book called Hellblazer, and while the movie does have its merits, it's not very faithful to the source material that it came from. The movie stars Keanu Reeves as a gumshoe whose specialty is in dealing with the occult. He specialty draws the attention of a police detective played by Rachel Weisz, who asks for his help in her investigation of her twin sister's suicide. A suicide that she thinks that is more than it appears to be. In due time, they both will encounter what lies under the surface of their world which is inhabited by both the angels of heaven and the demons of the underworld who are both fighting their own war for the fate of mankind. The movie is shot beautifully in the way it tries to capture both of the landscapes of good and evil that lives in this film's setting and the special effects does the film justice in its interpretation of hell that looks like an apocalyptic version of downtown Los Angeles, which is the setting of this film by the way. Unfortunately, the script is so unfocused that it hurts what this film trying to accomplish and the dialog itself lacks conviction for the material itself. The climax of the film is a major letdown because it just takes all the serious aspects of the film and just tosses them out in favor of a brief Matrix like a gunfight that undercuts the movie's tone and an incoherent ending that leaves more questions than answers. I'm not as hard as a lot of people are on the acting abilities of Keanu Reeves and he does his role well but his performance lacked something here in this film and it felt more phone in than genuine. Rachel Weisz on the other hand delivers a strong and moving performance that does deliver the goods but you will end up thinking that she is giving more to the film that it deserves because her performance is way too good for this movie. She's so good in fact that if the people who made this film wanted to make a faithful adaptation of the Hellblazer comic book, they could have cast her in the role of Kitt, Constantine's one true love. Now being a casual reader of the comic of whom this film is based on, the character of John Constantine is not well represented in this film and the script makes him look like a shill who wants to redemption which is the polar opposite of who the character is in the comic book who only served himself. The character also had a slick side to him that gave you the impression that he knew more than he let on while the character in the movie is flying by the seat of his pants during the whole film. Plus he relied on his wits to defeat his enemies while the character in the movie has a gadget man who makes him weapons (The brass knuckles scene in the movie is a joke because the John Constantine of the comic book can't handle himself well in a fight). The cancer subplot in the film only serves as a footnote while in the comic book, it had more of an impact and certain characters who show up in the film are just watered down versions of their comic counterparts. The most offensive of these characters is Chaz, who is John Constantine's best friend (and is a grown man with kids) but he is reduced to a street kid who is basically a lap dog for Constantine to pick on. The only character in the film that closely resembles the comic book is Papa Midnight, who's really more of an adversary in the comic than the friend he is in the movie. Judging this movie on it's own merits, It's a passable popcorn movie that has a better than deserved performance by Rachel Weisz. Judging the movie as an adaptation of the comic book, it's a letdown.",2005
9,"The Film Constantine, directed by Francis Lawrence, written by Kevin Brodbin and staring Keanu Reeves has only been out a short while and already has garnered enough acclaim to rank itself as a modern classic. The exciting, action loaded film follows the continuing saga of dark soul John Constantine, demon hunter. Punished by God to wonder the streets of Earth, for an attempted suicide, he now must 'earn' his way back into the grace of the almighty. To do this, he must hunt down and 'excorcise' every sort of demonic beast that plague's mankind. Aiding him are a host of penitent souls who have sinned and wish to redeem themselves. To make matters worse, is the Archangel Gabriel who want to step up the 'final' conflict and match powers with Lucifer (Peter Stormare) himself. Caught in-between their cosmic battle is Constantine, who must atone for his sin with self-sacrifice and brute power over the army of the dammed. Extremely good film and exciting from beginning to end. ***",2005
10,"I loved this film. I thought the special effects were amazing, thought the plot was amazing and thought all the actors involved did a great job. Of course there are a lot of comments that talk about Keanu Reeves acting abilities, but I think he did a grand job. The character Gabriel in this film is so intriguing. I was a little disappointed with Gavin's role as Balthazar. His role could have been expanded a bit. But all in all eerie, and definitely interesting. People who bash Keanu Reeves are more upset with the fact that he gets paid $30 million a picture even when the film isn't so great! But this one is great. I own it and everyone I have shown it to has absolutely loved it.",2006
7,"The movie deals about John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) , a tough detective in charge of exorcisms and throwing out supernatural beings and bizarre creatures toward hell , employing only as weapons a shot-cross and holy water . He has ability to go and back from inferno . He is helped by a sympathetic apprentice (Shia LaBeouf). Constantine teams up with a gorgeous policewoman called Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) to resolve the rare suicide of her twin sister (also interpreted by the same). They try to investigate the deeds at whatever risk . In the beginning , skeptical Angela doubts on the mysterious events are happening but she is caught up by ominous demon . Both protagonists will confront against forces of evil , the devil , Balthazar and underlings (Peter Stormare , Gavin Rassdale) . It's a horrible struggle between Angels- Gabriel (Tilda Swinton)- and demons developed in contemporary city Los Angeles .",2005
9,"It seems to be rather a provocative concept of the cold war between the Hell and Heaven (who knows who's good or evil...)... The heap of mystery, exorcism, action and the necessary explanations is surprisingly well balanced. ",2005
3,"I saw this film a few nights ago here in Albany and in have to say that I was disappointed with it. The special effects are terrific but the story needed a lot more work and Keanu Reeves looked like he was sleepwalking during the entire film, and to say that he was miscast in the role is an understatement. The character of Angela played by the wonderful Rachel Weisz is actually a much better character than Keanu's and would have been a better lead as well if you had people who really cared about what they were doing in this film and Djmon Hounsou is also very good as Papa Midnight and I found his character also more integral to the story than Keanu's. At least you knew where he was coming from and he had a more lively personality than the bored stiff composure of Keanu's John Constantine and Peter Stormare gives a lively yet somewhat campy turn as Satan himself. The ending is OK but the revelation concerning a character is not well done because of the fact that we only see that character for about one scene during the course of the whole film and then suddenly you're suppose to believe that the character was a major player, which in fact the film really does not explain at all towards the end.",2005
7,"Don't compare today's comedy version of ""The Longest Yard"" to the old with Burt Reynolds. Today's is good and effective for what it is, a comedy film with a bit of action interlaced. So many classic Hollywood films were so good, that any attempt at a remake is just going to fall flat on its face. The Longest Yard with Adam Sandler is more of today's take on the story if you asked me. It has humor, and is Sandler at his best with Chris Rock playing his role well too. Critics and classic moviegoers beware. Unless you are open-minded, you will never find the hidden treasures of the movie world. It's a football comedy, plain and simple.",2005
6,"People who lined up to bash this film had better get used to seeing more like it. Hollywood these days is stuck in a rut where three types of films account for nearly every film they release. Those are: remakes, sequels, and films based on comic book characters. The Longest Yard would of course fit into the first category. It is a slightly updated, but fairly faithful remake of the 1974 film of the same name. This time, we have Adam Sandler who plays the incarcerated quarterback that Burt Reynolds played in the original. Reynolds is on hand to play a minor role which the original film also contained. The plot is still the same. Prisoners vs guards in a game of football. Pretty simple.",2005
10,"I have read bad comment, after bad comment, about this movie, and I saw it, and I am sick and tired of everybody giving it a bad rap. People are downsizing it because it isn't enough like the original. But to truly enjoy this movie, you have to realize that it isn't really a remake. It's an homage. All it has is the same basic idea, and the characters. I found this an absolutely brilliant comedy, filled with frequent references to the original. It's genius characterizations of what some prison inmates might act like work perfectly. Especially Richard Kiels character turned into a weightier, less intelligent black man. I also quite enjoyed the frequent humor derived from taking scenes from the original and changing the words into PG-13. Although it originally seems silly, the player sh***ng himself scene is so much better when you realize it was originally the broke his f****ng neck scene. Also, the million one-liners, I guess could be taken badly, but only if you're looking for them to be. Possibly the reason everybody hates this so much is because they're looking for it to be the original. If you're going to see this, remember, it's not the original. Its an Adam Sandler movie making homage to the Longest Yard.",2005
6,"I went to this film thinking it was going to suck. I was a big fan of the original. Loved it as a kid, although I know it's not a great film or anything.",2005
7,"I'm going to start off by admitting that I had no interest in this movie whatsoever. I only saw it because I was dragged. Was it as bad as I thought? Not at all. It was way better than I expected it to be. We all know those mindless comedies that barely have a plot, cheap dialogue and jokes, and are just filled with stupidities galore. I thought this was one of them. I was wrong. This remake had a pretty good storyline and a few laughable jokes and moments. I usually don't laugh out loud at movies, but I did find myself doing so three or four times here. So that takes care of the Funniness Factor. The story is easy to get involved in--you want to see the prisoners kick the guards' butts in football. It is a well played story and fun to watch. Sandler is not one of my favorite actors, but I have to give him his props because I am starting to see that he usually stars in movies that are at least remotely funny and that have a pretty decent plot. But the main thing is that his characters usually act the same. I would get into the slight lack of character development, but I'm sure you don't care to read about that. You only wish to know if this movie is funny or not and if it's worth watching! Well, yes the movie has its moments and it's good to watch, especially if you like football or are a Sandler fan. This has its good kicks and it is near a touchdown in the comedy category. So if you want to have a good time and relax to some entertainment, you can watch this one =) ",2005
3,"I just saw this movie for the first time. I really like sports movies, so I was expecting to like it.

7,"I too got to see a free-sneak peak of this film in NYC and I'll tell you one thing . . there were no sleepers in the cinema! A very mixed crowd from race to ages here and everyone seemed to be having a great time . . even the teenager who sat behind me who reminded me of every actor when he appeared on the screen .. like Nelly. I haven't had this much fun in the theater in quite awhile. No, it's not a super serious film, but if you like football and the good feeling of revenge you'll love this film. Lots of violent blows from the guards and a little racism, but nothing too ""out of the ordinary"" . . some great one-liners from Chris Rock's character. A definite #1 film for Memorial Day weekend when it opens. I can see this film bringing in some good dough this summer.",2005
9,"I loved this movie! I have seen the original, also, and I have to say that this version is much more fun to watch and should appeal to a wider audience. For those who thought this was going to be a more serious movie for Adam Sandler....what on earth gave you that idea?? It's a comedy. It's meant to be funny and it is. If you are not a fan of Adam Sandler's then don't bother with it, because you won't like it. If you are a fan, I believe you will enjoy it very much. If you have absolutely no sense of humor, as it seems quite a few who have written comments about this movie are lacking just that, then don't bother with it either. I know when my husband and I saw it, the whole audience was roaring with laughter throughout the movie and my husband has informed me that he cannot wait for it to come out on DVD. It was a whole lot of fun to watch and I recommend it highly.",2005
4,"I wonder, will some corporate guy actually get a bonus for having thought that a remake of Mean Machine starring Adam Sandler would be a great idea? What kind of productive thinking is that? This movie not only adds nothing in the mean machine brand, but it serves as a Trojan horse that can destroy the myth from within. What is the redeeming value of having endured 2 hours of Adam Sandler and co? I couldn't find any. Even to say that it conveys an anti-racist message is a longer shot than those we see in the movie itself. The music is pathetic, but at least that was expected. Oh and I forgot, it is a comedy?

The idea was fresh, funny and well done... Then 31 years later this truly dreadful movie gets released.. The whole problem was trying to do a carbon copy of the original film..

1,"If this were a story that I were not familiar with,I would go ahead and say that this was another ""ok"" Adam Sandler film.However,since I am familiar with it,I cannot help but make the comparison to the 1974 classic.It is a matter of which film does a better job of telling the story.I hate to say it,but it isn't this one.When we think of the character of Paul Crewe,we think of the swagger of Burt Reynolds,not the goofiness of Adam Sandler.Chris Rock's Caretaker is in no way comparable to Jim Hampton's portrayal.I mean,Jim Hampton had a way of making us care about the guy.With Rock,you just didn't care as much when the man dies.Also,the story seems to be pushed along a little too quickly here,whereas the original graciously took it's time building up to the exciting finale,which wasn't as exciting here because we know what's coming.I gave this film every chance in the world to be at least comparable to the original,if not better that the original.It did not succeed,and even the presence of original stars Burt Reynolds and Ed Lauter did nothing to help it.A note to Hollywood:The notion that every classic film of old needs to be updated and modernized is thoroughly ridiculous.Leave the old classics alone and just let them be respected for the time period in which they were made.Enough already!",2005

Yes, there are plenty of penis/ass rape jokes. Finally, there is the lame Rob Schneider cameo in which he yells ""You can do it!"" Ha. Hilarious. Right? Wrong. This film lacks any genuine laughs or clever moments. Everything from the shameful product placement (""Oh, Halo 2?!

1,"This is by far the worst movie I have seen in recent years. I had no interest in the movie due to the inappropriate and inconceivable premise, I was shocked to find out that my low expectations were not low enough. The acting is stilted and awkward, the plot has holes you could drive a mack truck through, and the overarching moral and ethical implications are disgusting. Are we supposed to root for a bunch of convicts (rapists, murderers, arsonists, drunks) simply because prison guards haven't shown them a great deal of hospitality!?!? Give me a break! What does it say about this country when a stadium full of fans are cheering ""Convicts! Convicts"" in support of society's derelicts. I am shocked that people are able to respond to this film in a manner other than pure disgust and contempt. This film is racist, sexist, and degrading towards anyone with an IQ over 15.

3,"I rate Adam Sandler pretty highly as an actor: Punch Drunk Love and Spanglish are among my favourite films and he is excellent in both. Sadly, The Longest Yard utterly stifles this talent - and the talents of his co-stars, including Chris Rock, James Cromwell and William Fichtner - by entrusting the direction and script to witless cretins. I probably wouldn't have minded the litany of movie clichés if they hadn't been so wilfully and ineptly used. To make matters irredeemably worse, just about every ethnic and social male stereotype is kicked out onto the field for the delectation of their young white target audience. I haven't seen the original, but I'm willing to bet Burt came away from this remake ruing the direction popular cinema has taken since 1974.",2005
1,"Need I say in this review that I hate remakes, especially if the original was a classic? Nothing made today could even come close to the original Longest Yard. The only things there are to gain from a remake are self promotion and profits. Not because they love the movie, but because they want to feed off of what others love.",2005
5,"The original version of The Longest Yard is a near classic. Burt Reynolds was believable as the ex-football star turned bad guy. Burt Reynolds was a big, tough man in his 30s and 40s. he was one of the top sex symbols and movie stars at the time The Longest Yard was made in the mid-70s. It made sense that women were falling over him, which partially got him in trouble in the beginning of the movie. But Adam Sandler? Are you kidding me? Sandlker playing a role that Burt Reynolds originated? Sandler playing a role of a tough guy? That's just not believable. It's even more absurd that played a former NFL quarterback. This guy probably couldn't throw the ball a yard, much less the longest yard. The Longest Yard is a move that needs to be carried on the back of its star. Burt Reynolds did that so well in the original. Sandler, a huge miscast (probably by his own demanding) couldn't this movie off the ground. And that's where the football would be with him, on the ground, under a heap of football players who would have flattened the wimpy Sandler. The movie gets a five overall, however, because of a decent supporting cast (including Reynolds), and it was still a good story.",2013
1,"There is one difference between old and new, Adam Sandler. The Waterboy was funny, the excited Southerner (if your an Adam Sandler fan) is funny, but The Longest Yard is just another brick in the wall. Adam Sandler had made a point to insult three groups of people in his long career. He really needs to get help with his dislike of Southerners, people with money and ALL people with Irish names. Did he get beat up every day by rich, southern Irish people? Must have, because he HATES them! As for the movie, if your an Adam Sandler fan then you will probably like it. If you liked the Waterboy and the Wedding Singer then you have already experienced the humor thats in this movie. Not to mention, if you've seen the old one, you've already seen this one too.",2012

They cant even say the one word believably! They overact all the time! NO MATTER WHAT! Oh, and they as in the dumb ass's who call themselves ""writters"" cant seem to make one episode without putting down races. Estaban, who is Mexican or something, is always made fun of. One episode one of the idiot twins ""pretends"" he is a life guiding coach, and tells Estaban that he should learn to talk American! AND HE AGREES!!! Oh god! This show is horrible! And of course the sexual reference is all over the place! Idiot twin one says: Look at that HOT GIRL! (Of course saying it completely overacting!) And idiot twin two says: YEAH! Then cue complete fake ""laugh track that is used in every other Disney channel TV show!"" Oh, and of course the dumb ass rich girl (who acts just like Paris Hilton, oh good role model, NOT!)makes fun of poor people! And she and the candy counter girl of course wear skirts that are so short, that I am sure in post production, they had to edit out a lot of flashy material! Then of course dumb ass twins save the day. And everyone on EVERY EPISODE says at the end... ""oh Zacha and Cody, we should of believed you!"" I hate this show. I cant even watch it.

If you are new, I'll give you a brief synopsis; Zack and Cody Martin live with their mom at the Tipton hotel. Cody is the smart one. Zack is the one always making trouble.

I know this show is for kids, but it's still awful. I really can't understand how people can say this is a good show. Maybe the best show that Disney has produced, but that's just because they produce nothing but garbage. This show is nothing like real life. It's not funny, It's not even cute.

WTF? who lives in a hotel? also, the acting is terrible and way overreacted. zack thinks he is hot stuff but he is a stupid fat wanna-be and isn't the least bit hot like he says he is. All those people are dumb and that Esteban gets on my flippin nerves! His accent isn't anything close to any Latin-American that I've met. Plus they make Mr. Mosbey look like a bad guy just cuz he does his job and has common sense! I'd be frustrated too if I was surrounded by all those idoits. They're trying to teach kids it's cool to be stupid and lazy but if you're smart or you try to do your job, you're a ""nerd"" or a ""bad person"". When Carey is grounding Zack and Cody she says, ""No TV, no dessert, no life, and Cody, no reading for fun!"" Wtf? They're trying to teach kids that reading for fun is a bad thing and being smart like Cody makes you a nerd! But they wanna show you that if you're a lazy idiot like Zack who uses girls is cool! It's not! Overall this show sucks and the only reason I even give it one star is because IMDb doesn't have a rating for -50",2007
4,"The show is awful. Why? *Terrible acting, especially on the part of the Sprouses (portraying Zack and Cody). They are the worst actors in a television show that I have ever seen. Seriously. Apart from them, acting is mostly OK, but nothing spectacular. *Extremely stereotypical portrayal of all kinds of people, with kids being portrayed as always cute and lovable, and loving hip hop. The Estaban character really, really annoys me. His accent is nothing like that of any Latin-American I know. *The jokes are old and used. I have heard them all many times before. Most of the jokes are lifted from 80s and 90s sitcoms. Back in the early days of the series, sometimes I guiltily laughed once or twice an episode. But now the series has fallen upon days in which the same joke is used over and over again (I didn't laugh the first time Arwin fainted. I frowned the second time. I turned off the television the third time.). *The plots are recycled from those of every other Disney show (Zack and Cody run for class president, the Tipton enters a dance competition, Zack and Cody fight over a girl). *And the homophobic/anticross-dressing tones of the main characters.

So my heart sank a little when a film I have been eagerly awaiting was swaddled with such praise when the ads hit the air.",2005
10,"Wow, what a film. I had been waiting to see this movie since I read that Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon were cast in the lead roles. I was not sure what to expect when I heard they were going to do their own singing, but was I ever impressed. Their performances in this movie were brilliant, and I had chills down my spine. It was truly amazing how much Phoenix sounded like Johnny Cash-this was a role he was born to play, and he was mesmerizing. Totally sizzling. Witherspoon was positively radiant as June Carter, and talk about chemistry between the two actors. Talk about lightning striking! I only hope they are rewarded for their efforts come Oscar time. This was a truly amazing movie, filled with great music, a top-notch supporting cast and a terrific script which was wonderfully directed.",2005
9,"Considering the formula junk coming out of Hollywood these days, I was blown away by how good this movie was. The direction was perfect. Using close ups to get us in under the skin of Johnny Cash. And since it was a period piece, he could have bored us with lots of cgi of Memphis and L.A. to take us back in time. Instead he used the actors and the music to take us there. Biopics naturally have a formula to them, but the director and screenwriter did not take us down the track of overly sentimental scenes. These were real and done with a bit of well placed humor. Just like real life. Afterall you still have to follow the real lives of Johnny and June. You can't make it up, just to be original! The movie was also a movie you can take most of the family to. No nudity and sex to SHOW how in love they are, just real dialog...it's nice to hear REAL dialog and not just another chase scene, or four letter word. Yes, some movies need that to tell the story, this one doesn't. This movie goes onto my short list of great biopics, with ""Ray"". Not much else comes close to Ray or Walk the Line. The true test of any biopics is: can you still understand the plot even if you never heard of the people the movie is about. This movie is a great love story even if you never heard of Johnny and June Cash. Oscars all around I say! Plus I loved the Rockabilly music through out the movie.",2005
10,"I've long thought that James Mangold was one of the most underrated American directors; while other acclaimed auteurs like Wes Anderson and David Gordon Green have made names for themselves by essentially repeating themselves with each film, Mangold has attracted considerably less attention for actually having the gall to show some range. Like the great directors of the Hollywood studio system, Mangold shows visual and narrative skill across a wide array of genres: character-driven crime (COPLAND); horror (IDENTITY); issue-oriented drama (GIRL INTERRUPTED), etc. What each of these films shares in common is a stunningly elegant and expressive visual style, an attention to character reminiscent of Renoir, and an economy of storytelling that would make Howard Hawks envious.",2005
10,"Walk the Line is a great movie. When you watch it, you feel as though you are watching Johny Cash in person. Juaqin Pheonix is amazing as Cash, a man with so many regrets and self doubts. Reese Witherspoon gives an Oscar performance as the love of his life June Carter. The film is long, but worth every minute. But what is great is that T Bone Burnett chose the right songs to play. When I saw it today people in the theater were singing along with the movie. And what is great, is that Pheonix and Witherspoon sand the songs themselves. This movie should win several Oscars this year. Go see it. It is an amazing film, and it perfectly protrays an amazing man.",2005

I found the story and film-making a bit predictable, like the usual bio-pic formula that you might expect if you've seen, say, coal miner's daughter, or any other bio-pic of someone you love. What makes this movie stand out is the two lead performances. Reese is unbelievably convincing as June Carter Cash. She almost disappears into the role. And her singing! Who knew??? ",2005

However, it is quite another to make a portrayal bigger than life, and Reese makes June Carter Cash the central character of this film.",2005

Johnny Cash is one of my favourite country singers, nay, singers of all time, and I was unsure as whether, as with other mediocre biopics, namely the flashy Ray, could do him enough justice.

5,"Rarely has a biopic film made such a racket at the box office. After viewing the DVD version of WALK THE LINE the reasons for that success must be attached to some sort of homage to Johnny Cash, an American icon of sorts. Yes, his life and career are notable - the emergence of a legendary Country Western singer out of the elements of a warped childhood peaked by the accidental death of his older brother whom the father clearly preferred, and the torture of self doubt that haunted a man through an unsuccessful marriage and a thwarted love for fellow Country Western singer June Carter, his descent into alcohol and drugs, and his final victory over his demons - but isn't this the same story we see almost annually about famous stars whose backgrounds seem templates from this same mold? Joaquin Phoenix is a fine actor and has the courage to take on a variety of roles, succeeding in them all. And yes, he was able to sound like Johnny Cash (given the fact that even Cash's fans will admit it was not a voice of quality but of message). Much the same could be said for Reese Witherspoon's tackling successfully the equally mediocre quality voice of June Carter - again it was her sassy style that made her a star, not her voice. And perhaps that is the reason the writers and director elected to spend most of the screen time on the singing and concerts of Cash and Carter - leaving very little of the story of Cash's life except to outline form between songs.",2006

3,"I'll make this short and sweet, neither of which this film was. Bottem line, just another relationship movie. The acting was fair, the direction and photography were good, and yet I was grateful when this film finally came to a close. I found this to be a poor tribute to a musical legend. I am a big Johnny Cash fan, I grew up listening to him. To tell the truth I feel a little cheated on this one. I was hoping to at least hear some Jonny Cash music. Instead you get a couple of hours of someone else's idea of what Jonny Cash sounded like. If you're interested in relationship movies then you'll probably enjoy this one. If your not, pass.",2006
8,"I have always been very fond of his music but in truth knew pretty little about the man, so i learnt a lot about him when watching this movie. I never imagined that behind his tough cowboy image he was so fragile, delicate and weak. This is a story where love saves the day, otherwise God knows. Although even June Carter seemed prepared to have him once he gets a grip on himself alone first, and I don't blame her. From a troubled childhood, we were taken through an unhappy first marriage, the rise to fame, the hits and the heartbreaks. The movie really finds its feet when singer June Carter shows up and the pairs relationship provides the movie with a heart. Some great performance acting I must admit, pretty outstanding. The story is gripping, with Cash's life providing plenty of juicy material, but ultimately what is revealed is much more fascinating. It was not just the hard times but also, if not mostly, his love of an amazing woman that fuelled most of his musical genius.",2006
3,"I don't necessarily want to be spoon-fed a basic story, but some actual interesting events would have been nice? Possibly the only interesting thing in the whole film is Johnny's brave decision to play in the prison as a way of giving himself an identity as someone who gives hope to those who have lost it (and thereby giving himself reason to live). The endless live performances by the cast just frustrated the hell out of me, if I wanted to listen to the man in black live, I could just have bought the recording from Fulsome which would actually have been much better? His father randomly has an element of respect for him at the end of the film? How the hell did that happen? He just woke up one morning and decided 'son, you're the one with all the stories'? I just think the hyperbole which surrounds this film is totally unjustified. The plot is boring, the script is tepid and the cast, Witherspoon aside, totally forgettable. I don't even think it's a case for different people, different tastes, it's just an awful film with so many gaps in the story (which could have been filled by taking out the musical sections) it's just a waste of time to watch?",2006

What's more, there's a movie out about it, and it's called ""The 40 Year-old Virgin.""",2005
8,"Just came out of a sneak preview for this film. It had me laughing every 30 secs. The ending was so funny that tears were rolling down my face and it had me wishing I hadn't bought that large coke. There are definitely some lulls, but, overall, highly entertaining. The movie lets Steve Carell have a chance to shine after stealing the spotlight from both Jim Carrey in ""Bruce Almighty"" and Will Ferrell ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgendy"" in their movies. Paul Rudd is hilarious as always. I love that he can be so funny in these broad comedies and continues to work in indie dramas (like P.S.). I think that Seth Rogen should be getting more work, because he so freaking talented and engaging. Leslie Mann also had some incredibly funny moments. I highly recommend it for those who just want to laugh like a maniac. However, if you're easily offended, don't see this movie. If you're a rabid feminist, don't see this movie. And, please, not matter what, even if you think you're one of those ""hip"" parents, don't take your kids to this movie. Sure, you should let your teens go see this movie, just don't watch it with them. It would make for some incredibly awkward moments.",2005
8,"Steve Carell has made a career out of portraying the slightly odd straight guy, first on 'The Daily Show', and then in various supporting roles. In Virgin, Carell has found a clever and hilarious script that perfectly capitalizes on his strengths. Carell plays Andy Stitzer, a middle aged man living a quiet, lonely life. Andy is a little odd, but in an awkward nice guy sort of way. One night, while socializing with his co-workers for the first time, Andy accidentally reveals that he is a virgin. His co-workers, David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romany Malco), and Cal (Seth Rogen) initially tease Andy about his situation. But it's clear that all three have a certain respect for the decent human being that Andy is, and they resolve to help him out by assisting him in ending his virginity. And so begins Andy's quest into adulthood. Andy is the quintessential innocent, and the bulk of the humor derives from his naiveté to the situations he finds himself in throughout the film. Some of the humor is crude gross out stuff, but most of it is just well done intelligent comedy. In addition, I found some parts of the film actually pretty touching as Andy finds himself developing both romantic relationships and friendships perhaps for the first time in his life. I'm not trying to portray the movie as a love story or a drama; it's a rolling in your seats comedy. Still, every good comedy I have ever seen contains enough heart for you to care about the characters. A good comparison would be 'The Wedding Crashers' from earlier this summer. Virgin has a similar humor, but is perhaps a bit more vulgar in some of its jokes. I particularly loved the ending of the film, which I thought was a perfect way to end the flick. Without giving anything away, it reminded me of 'Something About Mary'. Very light and fun; it leaves you laughing and smiling, which is exactly how you should feel when you finish a comedy. I would highly recommend.",2005
9,"this is one of the funnier films i've seen. it had it's crude moments, but they were full of charm. it's Altmanesque screenplay, brilliant physical humour, and relaxed friendships were a pleasure to watch, and a slice of life most of us can relate to. and i can say with a measure of honesty that i was afraid for Steve Carell's nipple..i truly was. surprisingly, this is a good-natured, unabashed comedy that is essentially about love, and the many relationships we may find ourselves in along the way. Catherine Keener was terrific as Trish, and all of Steve Carell's friends were flawed but amiable, and so much fun. the idea that they suspected that Carell was a serial killer is a hilarious metaphor for a forty-year old virgin. but the simple truth was that he wanted to be in love first. original, charming, and very funny. highly recommended.",2005
10,"I got a free pass to a preview of this movie last night and didn't know  what to expect. The premise seemed silly and I assumed it would be a  lot of shallow make-fun-of-the-virgin humor. What a great surprise. I  laughed so hard I cried at some of the jokes. This film is a must see  for anyone with an open mind and a slightly twisted sense of humor.  OK.....this is not a movie to go to with your grandmother (Jack  Palance?) or small children. The language is filthy, the jokes are  (very) crude, and the sex talk is about as graphic as you'll find  anywhere. What's amazing, however, is that the movie is still a sweet  love story. My girlfriend and I both loved it.  Steve Carell is terrific, but (like The Office) the supporting cast  really makes the film work. All of the characters have their flaws, but  they also have depth and likability. Everyone pulls their weight and  the chemistry is perfect.  I can't wait to get the DVD. I'm sure it will be up there with Office  Space for replays and quotable lines.",2005
9,"I haven't laughed this hard at a movie in a long time. I got to go to an advance screening, and was thrilled because I had been dying to see it.

8,"Something about the 40 Year Old Virgin and the other comedy hit of the summer, Wedding Crashers, is similar, but they are two different films in some respects. Both are romantic comedies that have that kind of over-the-top, crazy sensibility that keeps the teens and guys in their 20's along with the usual dating crowd to go see the films. Both have some sort of formula to the stories as well. But by the end of the 40 Year Old Virgin, I think I found overall it was more satisfying than 'Crashers'. Although one can guess where the relationship story with Steve Carrell's character Andy and Catherine Keener's character Trish will go to, it isn't too basic for one to figure out like with Crashers, and the characters both leading and supporting are realistic, more rounded than most of the one-dimensional or unexplained people in the other. And, perhaps, it may also depend on how much you identify (or just find the lunacy) in both.",2005
10,"Steve Carell comes into his own in his first starring role in the 40 Year Old Virgin, having only had supporting roles in such films as Bewitched, Bruce Almighty, Anchorman, and his work on the Daily Show, we had only gotten a small taste of the comedy that Carell truly makes his own. You can tell that Will Ferrell influenced his ""comedic air"" but Carell takes it to another level, everything he does is innocent, lovable, and hilarious. I would not hesitate to say that Steve Carell is one of the next great comedians of our time.",2005

There are some painfully funny moments in the movie, but I probably blushed about as much as I laughed. Actually, I probably blushed MORE than I laughed. And if I wasn't literally blushing on the outside, then I was blushing on the inside. If there is absolutely nothing in this movie that embarrasses you then you simply have no shame.

10,"THE 40 YEAR-OLD VIRGIN (2005) **** Steve Carell, Catherine Keener, Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, Seth Rogen, Elizabeth Banks, Leslie Mann, Jane Lynch, Gerry Bednob, Shelley Malil, Kat Dennings. Hysterically funny high-concept comedy about the titular Andy Stitzer (wonderfully played by perennial second banana Carell in a truly extraordinarily comic breakthrough performance sure to stratosphere him to the A-list), a tech services rep for an electronics store in Southern California who is found out about his secretive identity by a trio of well-meaning yet entirely clueless womanizing co-worker buddies (Rudd, Malco & Rogen, each one degree funnier than the next) determined to get their friend deflowered no matter the cost. What follows is an unlikely yet very warm-hearted romance with a vivacious mother (the marvelous Keener having lots of fun here) leading to add more fuel to the fires within Andy. A surprisingly good-spirited and unapologetically raunchy romantic comedy; the funniest since ""There's Something About Mary"" with a shrewdly observant script by director Judd Apatow and Carell that features some astoundingly gut-busting sequences including a scathingly accurate David Caruso joke, homophobic debunking ribbing, send-ups of 'date-a-paloozas' and demystifying the war of the sexes with cheeky aplomb. A true winner and an instant classic; the funniest film of the year.",2005
10,"I was really surprised with this movie. Going in to the sneak preview, knowing nothing about the movie except for the one trailer I'd seen, I thought it was going to be a Dude Where's My Car kind of crap fest. I was expecting bad sex jokes and farting and a pathetic lead character who will get laid in the end because that's just how movies work. Instead I got a smart, surprisingly original movie about a decent, average guy who just never had sex.",2005
1,"Wow! This film is truly awful. I can't imagine how anyone could have read this badly written script and given it the greenlight. The cast is uniformly second rate with some truly horrendous performances from virtually all of the cast. The story is disjointed, fragmented and incoherent. The telling, leaden and predictable. No wit, no charm, no humour. Not sexy in the least. The characters remain as flat as the proverbial pancake. There's also a strong current of misogyny which became increasingly hard to stomach as the film went on. When your lead (Carrell) is unfunny and unappealing it's uphill from there. Despite it's phony turn-around ending where love triumphs over lust I was left with a sick feeling in my stomach. If this is what passes for humour and social comment then we're definitely doomed.",2005
1,"I thought this movie would be funny knowing how funny Steve Catrell was in ""Bruce Almighty"" and his TV show ""The Office"" but I was sadly mistaken. No matter how good or funny an Actor is, it always starts with the writing, and the writing for this Movie was terrible! Steve wasn't funny and none of his very unlikable friends were funny. I'm no prude but the crass, vulgar, and just plain asinine sexual ""jokes"" ( and I use that term loosely) were ceaseless. Maybe if you're a 12 year old boy you might like the dim-witted so not-funny humor, but it was an absolute insult to anyone who has a hint of intelligence. Why people think that you have to be sexually filthy and crude in every sentence to be funny is beyond me. This Movie would be good at a Fraternity Party, or a Bachelor's Party, where everyone is so smashed they don't know the difference. Besides the complete lack of any real humor, the Actors and Actresses (ha ha) were very poor. I know Steve Catrell has talent, but it was definitely not reflected in this Movie.",2005
1,"I admit that isn't a precursor for a bad film there have been plenty of no-brain comedies over the years that I thoroughly enjoyed. The main fault I'd have to find with this film is it's dreadful writing. It is terribly tired and formulaic i.e. shy guy seeks girl, friends give bad advice and embarrass shy guy, shy guy learns to be himself. None of the so called 'jokes' hit the mark notably any contributions from Andy's Indian/Pakistanii co-workers and his boss singing a Guatemalan serenade. WTF was that about? I suspect it was a cynical attempt by Steve Carrell and Judd Apatow to inject some Will Ferrell-style craziness into this terribly mundane comedy but it failed miserably and was just embarrassing. Anchorman was one of the best comedies in years. 40 Year Old Virgin highlights Ferrells considerable influence on that film.",2005

1,"""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" exists in a world I don't understand. A world where an electronics store employee can tell his boss to ""f*** off"" and broadcast videos of his naked ass throughout the store and not get reprimanded. A world where it's really funny to go drunk driving and smash into other peoples' cars. A world where it seems okay for a boss to sexually harass her underlings. A world full of raging and offensive stereotypes of ethnic minorities. And a world without any funny jokes! I am absolutely shocked at the seeming chorus of viewers who liked this movie. I thought every scene was like a bad Saturday Night Live sketch - not very funny to begin with, and stretched out beyond all rational thought. The chest-waxing scene went on FOREVER.",2005
7,"If you liked ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" you will love this movie. In fact, it rejoins a couple of the supporting cast of that film, starring Steve Carrell, who played ""Brick"" who, in my opinion, stole that show with his clueless stares and inane ramblings.",2013
3,"I know this will be very unpopular, but I found this movie to be mostly unfunny, way too long, incredibly predictable, and very base. For anyone seeking humor that does not insult one's basic level of intelligence, this is not the movie for you. There ARE some hilarious scenes, but they are very brief and sandwiched in between big fat loaves of the most low-level frat/high school humor I've seen in a while. It doesn't involve you enough to really want to see what happens, also because it rambles on for about a half hour too long.",2005
7,"''The 40 Year Old Virgin'''made me laugh a lot. I don't care if it is considered to be a very sexual comedy, I just enjoyed many of the jokes and scenes present in this movie. Steve Carell is perfect as the virgin nerd Andy Stitzer and I think the scene where Andy has his chest hair removed by wax one of the coolest, specially because it is real. Many of the actors and actresses present in this movie are well known or already famous,by the way.",2006

1,"Insufferably and embarrassingly poor on practically every conceivable level. The inept acting, scripting, pacing, continuity, and direction are as bad as anything I've ever seen. The plot meanders almost from the outset suffering from non-sequitur dialogue and situations, with any attempts at humor being as sophomoric as anything in the history of cinema . There are endless topics of discussion and mis-fire situations that seem to pop in from nowhere and leave to nowhere. ",2006
8,I really enjoyed this movie. The way the movie started in Europe and how dark it was there... and the journey to Jerusalem... just wonderful stuff up to that point.,2005
10,"Kingdom of Heaven (KOH) is an amazing film. I saw it in the theater but the reason it's so great is because of the 4-Disc Director's Cut, which is a must own for any KOH fan.",2006

10,"Kingdom of Heaven in 2005 will be what Gladiator was in 2000. Ridley Scott has delivered a worthy follow up to his Oscar winner, which is also based on medieval times, with a central heroic character, and supporting casts of characters based on history.",2005
7,"I can start by admitting that i'm a fan of ""Gladiator"". And why do i mention this? Because there are more similarities between ""Gladiator"" and this movie besides having the same director.",2005
8,"First of all, what can beat Gladiator, with lines like ""father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife"", etc. and Russell Crowe chopping off heads. Kingdom of Heaven is a similar heroic fable yet the good and evil polarity is slightly more ambiguous. I would say it was vastly better than Alexander. Ridley Scott's style (cinematography and music) as seen in Black Hawk Down and Gladiator also lend a wonderful historical ambiance. Orlando Bloom does a fine job as the lead, and the French actress is fantastic (and beautiful), but my favorite lead was the Leper King and the wise nobility of his character. The battle scenes are excellent (including one in falling snow in which the snowflakes seem to hang in the air) and the armies look very historically realistic - this is a very good-looking epic. Formulaic perhaps, but well-executed. Kingdom of Heaven made me feel like leaving the ""blacksmithy"" that is our dull modern urban existence and finding a cause worth fighting for, but Crusades just aren't what they used to be =D",2005
10,"This film is all about faith and humanity.20th Century Fox was foolish to hold back Ridley Scott's cut of the film from theaters. Sure, at three hours and 10 minutes, this version is nearly 50 mins longer than what ended up in multiplexes, but that missing time completes what is easily one of the best historical epics of Hollywood history.It's really a shame that most people have assessed & rated the film by its weaker version.Its rating should be at least 8.5 or around that.",2014
10,Firstly I think its important I mention that there are two Kingdom of Heaven's and that they are entirely different films. ,2014
9,"Many of the reviews above I agree with, but I also saw the theatrical version and was very disappointed (6 out of 10). When the Director's Cut came out it was 45 minutes longer, so you fear the worst, MORE of the same. In this case, the story line is filled out and the motivations and characters are fleshed out. Eva Green went from, ""why is she in this movie"" with virtually no screen time and less dialog to a major character who moves the plot, as you would hope given her billing. The opening scenes in France are greatly expanded and meaningful. The action scenes are better, but not substantially. The Director's cut should have been the official version of the movie, the theatrical cut is a poor excuse.",2012
10,"KOH is not Gladiator 2, first of all the movie is not about a slave dealing with Romans, at the heart of the movie is the battle for Jerusalem and two sides the Christians and the Muslims. KOH in my opinion raises up more issues than what Gladiator did and then some.",2005
7,This film had the potential to be better than Gladiator - for a start it's a great deal more accurate and it also boasts a smarter script full of contemporary analogies that link it to present-day Middle East conflict.,2005
7,I'd heard a lot about KINGDOM OF HEAVEN when it was released in 2005 . Most of the reviews were rather uncomplimentary so I made a point of missing it until it was broadcast on Channel 4 last night and as I write this review I remember a lot of beautiful things about this movie . Unfortunately I can remember far more things that annoyed me ,2008
3,Okay. Movie review time.,2005
5,"Kingdom is at its heart a Ridley Scott film; plot and acting be damned, I'm going to make a pretty movie. This dedication to cinematic beauty has garnered Scott a devoted following, and I will give him credit that at least he stays true to his course as a director. But some of us who sit in the seats (though judging by box office returns, increasingly few of us) actually like to use our brains when we watch a movie, and sadly, Kingdom doesn't give us much of a chance to do that.",2005
5,"The movie had the opportunity to be something memorable but it missed the chance. Firstly, the viewers were not given a good overview of the history of Jerusalem, so some of the viewers could not really figure out what is happening. The story started with an sub-par battle scene where some very interesting characters got slaughtered, which is a shame.",2005
10,Ridley Scott's epic Kingdom of Heaven explores the roots of our modern religious conflicts in the context of the Crusades during the 12th century. The Crusades are really such a monumental piece of history and there hasn't really been a good epic that's been made about them before this movie. And what a film it is. I actually believe this to be Ridley Scott's finest film yet.,2013
5,"I had the pleasure of viewing this movie last night at a sneak peak. Although the visual aspects of the film were astounding and quite incredible the film seemed to lack a substantial plot. The story idea of the movie was a wonderful idea but the way the film came across made the overall feeling of the movie dwindle down. Once again we see Orlando Bloom in a war epic movie where he must make the decision of love or to do what is right. Bloom can certainly act but it seems that he is only cast into these types of films and seems a little bit redundant. Other people are comparing this movie to be the next Gladiator but I must disagree. The film didn't have that powerful of a moving feeling like Gladiator, in fact the only time that I felt remorse is in the bond between the Leper King and his sister. All in all, I wouldn't have paid to see this movie. I can't either say that I like or disliked it. The movie didn't move me towards anyway and left me wanting more from the plot. Some may enjoy this movie mainly based on the visual graphics and the historical stand point, but those expecting a reincarnated Gladiator are in for a let down.",2005
1,"Love Ridley, loved Gladiator, but this movie is a dog! As far as I can tell, except for Liam Neeson and Ghassan Massoud, it's a bunch of stiffs and slow-mo gore.",2005
4,"What is Jerusalem worth? Not much in this epic. With men such as Liam Neeson, Orlando Bloom, and Jeremy Irons playing the lead roles, one would belief this to be possibly one of the better of the recent epic piles of big-budget scrapheaps, such as the lackluster King Arthur or downright-awful Alexander. This assumption, however, is wrong. Kingdom of Heaven is two hours and about 25 minutes in length. It is only those last twenty five minutes that are actually devoted to the battle for Jerusalem; The rest is random clips strung together with the hope of converting a few years into two hours, which rarely ever works. The editing of this story is the main problem in addition to the lack of flow to the tale. Jumping from some European country then heading west to where the men speak Italian then heading further on to where they speak something, the story's structure is like a ten year old recalling his or her history lesson for the entire school semester in a minute.

7,I'm a huge fan of the Dukes of Hazzard TV show. And I really enjoyed this flick. I enjoyed myself here a lot more than I did with other summer blockbusters.,2005
6,"Okay, so a lot of people are going to tear this film apart. And they are right to do so; after all, it certainly isn't a very intelligent film. In fact, it is a relatively idiotic film. But it's also a fun film.",2005
7,"Having read some of the other comments here I was expecting something truly awful but was pleasantly surprised. REALITY CHECK: The original series wasn't that good. I think some people remember it with more affection than it deserved but apart from the car chases and Daisy Duke's legs the scripts were weak and poorly acted. The Duke boys were too intelligent and posh for backwood hicks, the shrunken Boss Hog was too cretinous to be evil and Rosco was just hyper throughout every screen moment. It's amazing the series actually lasted as long as it did because it ran out of story lines during the first series.",2005
6,"I had low expectations when going to see this film, so I wasn't disappointed: it was a lot better than I expected.",2005
1,"When I was six years old, I remember watching the Dukes of Hazzard on TV and being mesmerized. Daisy Duke was the woman that showed me that it was OK to like girls, and owning the General Lee would be awesome. Upon watching the movie I felt my heart sink in my chest. Jessica Simpson is one of the hottest women in Hollywood, but do you think they could have at least found a brunette who could act. That would have been nice. And that wasn't Bo and Luke Duke, that was Stifler and Jacka**. It was a great opportunity to make a great movie that fans would appreciate and it was filled with useless drivel just to sell the movie. The Duke boys can sell themselves without Jessica Simpson in a bikini. And did you notice that there were no cameo's of any of the original cast members. I wonder why.",2005
1,"Film makeovers of old TV shows seems to be the norm in Hollywood these days, but this disrespectful, toilet humor, do-you-kiss-your-mother-with-that-mouth foul language, rip-off is a blatant middle finger to all Dukes of Hazzard fans both north and south of the Mason-Dixon Line. From the opening sequence of Bo and Luke Duke making a moonshine run for Uncle Jesse (no shine running in the show because it would put the boys back in jail as a parole violation) to the closing sequence of Uncle Jesse smoking weed with the Governor of Georgia (Uncle Jesse was the moral compass despite his previous moonshining ways) this disappointing waste of film is an open faced insult. I can't tell you how many parents I saw get up and remove their children from the theater within the first 15 minutes of the movie when they realized that they had been horribly deceived. The Original Dukes of Hazzard was a family show with basic moral values. The Original Dukes of Hazzard was a kid safe, Hemi powered, show of fun that parents didn't have to worry about teaching their kids George Carlin's seven words. I have read reviews stating that the show and the movie are nothing but racist. Those commits might be correct about the movie. Those commits are ABSOLUTELY incorrect about the show. The show, if anything, was about how to get along and be friends with ANYONE. Hollywood has finally come out in the open about their disdain for those of us, Yankee, Rebel, or otherwise, who still believe in honor, loyalty, trust, family, and doing the right thing even if it is not the popular thing. Hollywood has finally brought to light its belief that those of us in the heartland are stupid, uneducated, beer swilling, foul mouthed, trash that will buy any piece of garbage they are willing to sell. Prove the Hollywood Elitist that they are wrong. DO NOT GO SEE THIS MOVIE. Boycott the sponsors. Fill Warner Bros. email and snail mail boxes with complaints that we don't appreciate them destroying one of the greatest T.V. shows of all time. Save your money and buy the DVD's of the original show, but whatever you do DO NOT GO SEE THIS MOVIE",2005
1,"...then you'd better not watch this movie. They've completely ruined the premise of the show. In the movie the Duke boys are idiots, Daisy is trampy, Roscoe is sinister, Boss Hogg is capable, Uncle Jessie is a criminal...only Cooter and Flash are true to the original characters. At least Enos is kinda close.",2006
1,"Let me start by saying that my husband gave me ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" movie for a gift. We were open minded about it and hoped that the critics were wrong. However within the first 10 minutes we could see why it was panned. This movie barely kept our attention with the lame jokes and comments. What got to me most was the sexual comments made constantly during the movie. In my experience watching the original series, not once did I ever hear Daisy say that she ""would have to shake her butt in front of someone to get Bo and Luke out of trouble"". It was known in the original series that Bo was a kind of ladies man, but not once did it show frontal nudity or even show him doing anything disgusting. This movie, in my opinion was nothing more than a peep show for guys that have nothing else better to do. The sexual comments and obvious reason why Jessica Simpson was cast disgusted both my husband and myself. It was obvious that Miss Simpson was cast for sexual pleasure not acting talent. The two actors who played Bo and Luke were terrible; no chemistry period. They portrayed Bo and Luke as idiots and if I were part of the original cast, I would be livid at the portrayal of the lovable characters. Now, on to the General Lee-now in the first shots of the car, it looked great. However, when they shot the interior it was obvious that certain pieces of the interior were not stock to the original Charger. The least the creators could've done was to keep the General Lee all original seeing that they couldn't be bothered to keep the characters even close to the original guidelines. Now, I've heard that it's a new movie and not to compare it to the series. How can you not compare it to the series? We grew up watching the original series and this movie is a complete joke and disgrace. The writers should be ashamed of the butchering they did to the ""Dukes"". In closing, I couldn't wait until the movie ended. My husband apologized to me for buying it and said ""I didn't think it would be that bad"".",2005
1,"Why take a show that millions of us watched and loved as children and make a complete joke of it? They ask why Hollywood isn't making the money it used to. Because they put out garbage and pay actors huge amounts of money to be garbage men and ask us to pay $10 to see their garbage. The TV show was what it was, good people in bad situations where the good IL' boys come out on top. It wasn't Gone with the Wind but it was fun. This movie is garbage! Hollywood can't come up with anything original so they take something that was good and ruin it for some $$$$. I only hope that this movie makes 10x's less than it cost to make. The only one's to have any fun with this crap are the guys who got to drive the General Lee. The audience is the victim.",2005
1,"When I heard that the Dukes of Hazzard was going to be remade with current actors and a solid script, I was like, ""alright, I'll give it a chance, it's not going to be better than the first, but we'll see what happens."" Well, I saw what happened. I saw a great late 70's/80's show that was a classic, basically humiliated by Hollywood. It's so sad to see that Hollywood scriptwriters cannot come up with something original these days. They are seeming to take a great show that had a great target audience, and try to ""REMAKE"" the classic show. HEADS UP Hollywood... IT AIN'T WORKIN!!!! Anyway, more about the show. I think they could have casted a better actor than Sean William Scott (Stiffler from American Pie) to play Bo. I'm sure that John Schneider is definitely disappointed with how his character was portrayed and taken advantage of. Also, Get for real, Johnny Knoxville, as Luke Duke. How low can you go?? A crappy jackass actor to play lovable Luke. This sickens me. Also, I'll give Jessica Simpson is a beautiful woman, but her acting sucks. Catherine Bach who played the original Daisy, was smart, sexy, strong, opinionated and a good IL' southern girl. She was every little girls role model growing up! (I owned the doll and the Jeep - thank you very much!!!) Anyway, Jessica Simpson played a smart ass, 2-bit slut as Daisy Duke. Daisy never was blonde. Why did they have to cast her. Jessica Alba would have played a great Daisy Duke. She can speak with a great southern accent, and she is gorgeous, and would have done a wonderful job. Anyway, I'd like to say that this movie blew something fierce. I feel like I got ripped off by paying $8.50 for tickets, and they should refund my money. If you like the Dukes of Hazzard (the original series) don't see this movie. It'll just upset you. CMT (country music television) plays the reruns of the Dukes all the time later at night. So set your TIVO's and go with the real thing, not the imitation on the big screen in Hollywood.",2005
1,"I am a huge fan of the original Dukes of Hazzard TV show, so I was really happy when I found out that it was going to made into a movie. Well all of my excitement disappeared quickly during the first five minutes of the movie. In that short time I realized that the director and writer of this movie really screwed up the whole point of the original TV show. For anybody who has seen at least one episode of the Dukes of Hazzard, they know that Uncle Jessie is a very respected man who was a very strong father figure to Bo, Luke, and Daisy. He would give the world if it would save his family from getting in trouble. Heck he gave up running Moonshine so Bo and Luke would not spend the rest of their lives in prison. Well in the movie all Uncle Jessie is a old man who rather smoke weed, run moonshine, or cuss all day then do anything else. Willie Nelson's version of Uncle Jessie was definitely not the strong Christian father figure who kept the Duke family together by teaching them great morals and being that positive role model in their lives--like Denver Pyle was. I can safely say that the late Mr. Pyle would be greatly upset if he was still with us today, to see how bad Hollywood has turned the DOH into a sleazily trashy film. I officially am boycotting this horrible mockery of what was and is still today a great family orientated piece of American History, the Dukes of Hazzard TV show. THANKS FOR ROYALLY SCREWING UP THE DUKES OF HAZZARD. It is very clear to see that you have not seen the show, and never understood it and what made it so great in so many people's eyes over the years. You should be ashamed of yourselves for making such a horrible movie with so much trash and crap in it that it is not even funny. You had a great opportunity to make a great clean family film that still would make a lot of money in the theaters. This movie did not need all of the cussing, sexual references, and drug related stuff to sell it. The original Dukes of Hazzard concept would of been more then enough to sell this movie. Evidently the director and writers of this film do not understand how much of a following the original show still has today twenty something years after it's debut. If they did they would understand that they are only hurting themselves by destroying what made the original show so great. I can guarantee that all of the die hard Dukes of Hazzard fans will not buy this movie when it comes out on DVD/VHS because you really screwed it up so bad.",2005

The cast was terrible ! It wasn't ""The Dukes"", it was Stiffler and Jackass driving a car. When was Boss Hogg evil? When was Rosco a tough guy? They never were ! Boss Hogg was greedy and Rosco was an idiot. When did Jesse smoke pot? He never did ! Now don't get me wrong,I'm very liberal and there's nothing wrong with a little chiba, but it had no place in this movie!

Of course the film isn't a masterpiece, i don't think it was aiming to be. It was fun and funny, i never watched the show when i was younger, i only recently saw one episode, and when i watched the movie, i felt it had the same kind of atmosphere. The movie seats were practically shaking, and the car sequences were good because it didn't bore me and drag out like some of the scenes in 2fast 2furious. and jessica Simpson is plain hot, i just wish they had used her more in the action sequences. All in all, i had a hell of a time watching this and i would go and see it again soon and i will buy it on DVD. People, enjoy it for what it is.",2005
1,"This movie is a shame and a disgrace to the Duke family name. I was a huge fan of the show. HUGE. But this was the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. John Schneider must be spitting nails to see Stifler in his driver's seat. Calling this film the Dukes of Hazzard was a poor smokescreen for selling a bad film. No matter how hard they tried, none of those jokers are, or will ever be, Dukes. Daisy Duke (played by Catherine Bach) was hot, smart, and sassy. Now don't get me wrong, Jessica Simpson is one of the hottest women alive, but she is no Daisy Duke. Her Daisy was a bimbo who just walked around in a bikini all of the time. Also, I love Willie Nelson, but he wasn't Uncle Jesse, he was Willie Nelson. All in all, this film turned my stomach and did a great dis-service to the name of the Dukes of Hazzard. Nice car and jumps though.",2005
1,"First let me say that I am not a Dukes fan, but after this movie the series looked like Law and Order. The worst thing was the casting of Roscoe and Boss Hogg.

He was more a Barney Fife than the role he played in this movie.",2005

1,"Hollywood now has officially gone too far and I really hope that this travesty of a motion picture creates a genuine backlash against their crap machines, in spite of the good box office returns. If you are an industry person reading our comments looking for hints on what to do next, STOP. Stop making our TV shows into these repellent, stupid, money grubbing waste of time movies that suck. By doing so you are proving one thing: Hollywood is out of ideas, and going to see the movies they churn out only perpetuates the cycle of disgust. What's next -- You guys gonna go & ruin The Bionic Man??",2005
1,This film is absolutely terrible. I'm sure it has a high budget and everything but it still doesn't cut it. The acting is really bad especially from Jessica Simpson. The stunts are well done but still is boring and predictable. It seemed like the creators thought that they were creating an action packed masterpiece or something. What were they thinking. This is really the worst film ever to reach theaters. Heck I've seen b movies that had better acting and special effects than this hunk of junk. The old dukes of hazard was OK. I never really watched it much at all. But this wannabe original film is really hard to watch. Jessica Simpson just is the worst actor and she acts like shes the hottest thing in the world or something. So unless your absolutely obsessed with the old dukes of hazard then I can recommend this film. But to everybody else avoid this movie like the plague.,2005
1,"I was not really excited to see this movie after seeing the initial previews it looked like another one of those remakes that was going to ruin the show (Starsky & Hutch, Bewitched,I Spy). I went into the theater not expecting much and thats what i got. The movies drags on and on for an hour and a half with crude cokes and cleavage. Johnny Knoxville was a good choice it seemed for the role but did not quite pull it off, he didn't have the same feel or look as Tom Wopat(the original Luke).Seann William Scott was not a good choice to play Bo and it showed his acting was terrible and he didn't seem to feel comfortable in the role. Jessica Simpson was the only actor that made this movie worthwhile (it gave you something to look at). But, probably the role that didn't make much sense was Burt Reynolds playing boss hog. In the show boss hog was not a tough as nails kind of guy that Burt Reynolds comes off to be. So as i said a movie with high expectations that will probably flop.",2005
1,I honestly thought that this movie was awful. The only thing that may have swayed my opinion in the least was Daisy. I Think that is why the ratings of people in the younger age group rated it higher than the older groups.,2005

Not one I cuff and scuff dem duke boys. He stunk up the joint. Burt Reynolds was totally miscast as Boss Hog. Danny Devito would have been a much better choice.",2005
1,"First off I would like to say I am in no way trying to make enemies, I am just expressing my own opinion. When I heard about this movie before they even did casting, I knew they were going to pick some pop singer with not the best acting skills to play Daisy. I WAS RIGHT :)! The thing that upsets me the most, surprisingly wasn't the plot, or the characters at all, it was simply the horrible accents. Jessica Simpson is from Texas, so why can't she make a decent southern accent? It sounded too made-up and that alone sets the tone for the way you look at the rest of her skills in this movie. the only cast member that had a good southern accent was Willie Nelson, AND THATS CAUSE ITS REAL! It's important when you re-make a classic, that you keep the simplest things the same, this film didn't. My advice to anyone who wants to see this is, don't waste nearly $10.00 on seeing this movie in theaters, at least wait until it's on video so you can save some money by renting it.",2005
3,"After the screening, some people cheered and clapped, others sat in disgust and laughed. I felt cheated. Spielberg was not even playing within his own rules. When the attack begins, every piece of electronic equipment stops working. There is even a nice shot of Tom Cruise's watch, stopped, of course. However, moments later when the Tripod rises from the earth, people are snapping pictures on digital cameras and one person is videotaping everything on a camcorder.",2005
6,"What Spielberg, Cruise, and Koepp accomplish here in the first two acts is nothing short of revolutionary. They've made a big-budget summer blockbuster about massive destruction and action that manages to studiously avoid every cliché and expectation of such films. It stays resolutely on the characters' points of view, showing us almost nothing they don't see, even to the point of coming tantalizingly close to a raging battle, then avoiding showing it. It keeps its focus on character instead of spectacle. The ""hero"" of the piece remains decidedly unheroic, wanting only to escape, and trying to talk others out of fighting back. The purpose of every piece of action is to frighten and disturb rather than thrill, making ingenious use of familiar 9/11 imagery. At the end of the second act, it is hands-down the best alien invasion film ever made, and perhaps one of the best sci-films of all time.",2005

1,"Ugh, what an awful movie! War of the Worlds is the ""modern adaptation"" of the classic tale of murderous aliens come to do us harm. This movie starts, runs, and ends with a serious of contradictions and ridiculous situations that beg the question, ""What's the point of this movie?"" Tom Cruise plays Ray Farrier, a crane operator who ends up having to babysit his two kids while his now-pregnant-by-another-man ex and her new dude go to Boston for a weekender (can you smell the dramatic tension?). From there, mysterious lightning storms erupt near Cruise's house and everyone runs to see what's happening. Of course, killer robots from Mars or whatever come up from underground and the slaughter begins.",2005
3,"Spielberg shouldn't be allowed to make science fiction films. He managed to take parts of the book and parts of the old movie and add in enough of his own nonsense to make something far inferior to either. He took the crazy curator from the book, give him some of the ideas of the artilleryman and the name of the scientist killed in the beginning of the book to make the only really likable character in the movie, brilliantly played by Tim Robbins, who is deserving of another Oscar for this performance.",2005
1,"This movie is one of the biggest let downs ever made. This movie has one of the biggest budgets ever, yet it still fails to provide a decent portrayal of an alien invasion. The effects are beautiful, yes, but they are backed up by no substance in the acting or writing and often makes no sense at all. The movie starts out in New Jersey where Tom Cruise's ex-wife is dropping off the kids for the weekend. Cruise goes to investigate strange lightning or something and an alien emerges and attacks the crowd of people watching nearby. For some reason, Cruise is the only one (what?) who manages to escape the death beam (or whatever) and gets home to get his kids out of the city to get to his ex-wife's house because it is safer (huh?). Eventually, his quest for his ex-wife leads to him having to travel an insanely long distance to get to the city where she is. The son soon runs off to fight the aliens and runs off into a field full of aliens that is on fire (no really). Then Cruise hides in a basement with his 12 year-old daughter and some crazy guy (that is really creepy). Cruise the kills the guy with a shovel (I swear to god) in a (rather) desperate attempt to shut him up. After about an hour hiding in the basement they flee from an alien and single handedly kill one of the machines that an nuke didn't even manage to kill. Once they get to Boston, they see that the people of Baltimore are not harmed at all and that the aliens died from germs. The son is also safe at home even though he ran into a fiery pit of death and it was (of course) suspected that he was killed. In the end the worst part of this movie is the end. After a big action packed action thing (even I found that statement a little silly) the aliens die of germs and it just ends. This makes the end seem forced and may make you want to die, especially because you just watched a movie where they hide in a basement for half of it and then germs kill the aliens.",2005
9,"Steven Spielberg's adaptation of H.G. Wells' War of the Worlds is another home run for the king of the blockbusters. It's big, expensive, and action- packed, but with an overarching sense of terror and real world panic, War of the Worlds succeeds where most alien invasion/disaster movies fail. It is genuinely frightening. I can enjoy lighter disaster fare like 2012 and Independence Day because seeing things get blown up can always provide for some amount of fun, but War of the Worlds is no Independence Day, and that's a very good thing. As an alien invasion story, War of the Worlds doesn't play the conflict up for cheap thrills and fun. It plays it straight, focusing for the first time on the serious real-world implications of such an invasion. ",2015
4,"Spielberg! Tom Cruise!! A tried-and-true sci-fi classic by H. G. Wells!!! Together they should add up to a great summer popcorn movie, but here's how to squander a golden opportunity by making all the wrong choices: Make sure there isn't a single sympathetic human character in the entire film, so that we'll be sure to root for the Martians (or whatever they are). Make your central family so quarrelsome, incurious, irrational, and just plain annoying that we long to escape from their company -- and then force us to spend the entire movie seeing all the events through their eyes. Let Tom Cruise bicker with his teenage son in a tedious sitcom way while civilization is crumbling around them and hundreds of people are being vaporized. Encourage Dakota Fanning to scream, scream, scream throughout the entire film so that we can savor the joy of having a little kid screaming shrilly in our ears. Take a heart-meltingly beautiful actress like Miranda Otto and make her pregnant so that she looks pudgy and matronly -- and since she's the Mother Figure, don't give her anything interesting to do. Have human beings -- who might be expected to scatter and flee at giant killer tripods -- crowd together and gaze up at these lethal 200-foot-tall machines with a dumb awestruck wonder approaching zombiehood (even a herd of sheep would display more survival skills). In particular, at the first sight of the first alien war machine thrusting up from the pavement somewhere in Queens, NY, have your multiethnic crowds assemble around the widening hole just inches from the edge and peer inside, even as the sidewalk begins to crack and buildings around them fall to pieces. Give the hero a Quest, a Goal, that's really dumb and just this side of pointless -- in this case, somehow getting himself and his two kids from NYC to Boston, where his ex-wife is -- but don't reveal how he manages, improbably, to get there, and don't let us know why he assumes she (or anyone in Boston, for that matter) would still be alive. Don't give any other human beings any direction or motivation at all, but instead just show them shuffling like refugees down roads, bound God knows where, or fleeing together in a panic -- for no logical reason -- onto a ferry boat which has no chance of getting away and no particular safe place to go. Wherever humans are, have them congregate in groups so that the lethal tripods can pick them off and slaughter them more easily. Have the motivation and intentions of the aliens themselves remain thoroughly obscure: At first, when they presumably want to rid the earth of mankind, don't have them use poison gas (as I seem to recall Wells did), but instead let them content themselves with firing death rays, like target practice, at individual fleeing humans -- the most inefficient method of extermination imaginable. Then, midway through, suggest that -- for no particular reason -- the aliens are vampires who seek human blood. When all of metropolitan New York, or perhaps the whole East Coast, is plunged in a blackout, have the hero and his family reach an unnamed suburb at nighttime where, miraculously, the one house they're seeking is flooded with light: the only house on the street, standing empty but with every light inexplicably burning (and no other humans around to investigate). Have the hero be a derrick operator and presumably something of a technical expert, but don't use any of his expertise during the course of the story. While the eponymous War is raging, don't use the benefits of modern computer graphics to show us what's interesting (such as a battle between the Air Force and the aliens); keep the action for what seems a quarter of the film confined to a couple of basements, so that, claustrophobically, we feel as if we're watching a low-budget three-person stage play with all the action going on -- unseen -- outside the windows. Whenever possible show humans screaming, despairing, panicking, and fighting among themselves -- never cooperating or displaying any ingenuity. Take the one potentially interesting, sympathetic character (Tim Robbins), the one character who has a dream, however crackbrained, of resistance to the invaders, and quickly turn him into a loony that will engage Cruise in a fight to the death. When, in the time-tested Spielberg manner, you have the Family Reunited At The End, stage the scene in such a hokey, amateurish, improbable way that the audience around me laughed derisively.",2005
7,"""War of the Worlds"" is Steven Spielberg's third movie in which extraterrestrials visit Earth, but the first in which their intentions are malevolent. It can't be coincidence that the arrival of the ETs is heralded with eerie lights flashing amid lowering clouds, as in ""CE3K."" From there, the similarity ends--no light show as friendly aliens come in for a closer look. These creatures (presumably Martians, as in the original H.G. Wells novel) aren't interested in making nice; nor is there any ambiguity about their ultimate objective (as there was for much of ""CE3K""). They're here to wipe us off the face of the planet, plain and simple, a point we understand before the movie has played for even half an hour, and the giant walking tripods they deploy are remorselessly efficient. So, too, is the movie--at scaring the hell out of us, notwithstanding some gaping plot holes (what's up with that camcorder, anyway?) and a couple of sequences that are too reminiscent of other movies (particularly ""Independence Day"" and Spielberg's own ""Jurassic Park"").",2005

Instead, Spielberg has made forgettable junk, cobbled together too quickly, with far too little imagination. Apart from a decent enough alien fighting machine, this was an artless pastiche of many superior versions of this overused story. If you are not going to re-imagine a story, why bother telling it? This screenplay was barely written at all, it feels like it was jammed together over a couple of conference call story meetings.",2005

1,I was pretty excited to go out and see this movie on opening day only left to be wondering what was the point of this movie. From the very beginning I was annoyed by the kids. Dakota Fanning was not cute and after the first five minutes of Tom Cruise being the bad father it was time for her to go into flip out mode for the entire film. Her constant screaming and whining felt like I was going to have to babysit her from the audience. The Aliens intent was never fully known in the film and that frustrated me even though that may have been the intent of Wells. (I have never read the book or seen the movie). There seems to be no distinct time period in the movie but the aliens are supposed to be making an extinction attempt and yet this whole family is absolutely fine and their house in Boston is still fully intact. How stupid. When Cruise's son disappears it almost seems like Spielberg does this because he won't fit in when the alien arm scene. I have just been left utterly confused by what the point of the movie was. Tom Cruise still didn't come off as a good father at the end and while I liked the fact that the smallest creature took down the aliens it seemed very rushed at the end just to get it over with even though I was more then happy to get out of there. Go see this one in the cheapies for the effects or rent it not worth 10 bucks.,2005
4,"Just saw a sneak of War of the Worlds. It surprises me how a collection of so much talent can make a product so, I'm sorry to say, bland. Yes, it has good points. The war machines are impressive, the destruction sequences (what there are of them) are awesome, and the special effects in general are incredible. But this is what we've come to expect in a Spielberg film. A movie needs more than cool special effects... we learned that way back with Star Trek: The Motion Picture.",2005

3,I really wanted to like this movie. I really did. But I found myself wanting to choke out the characters by the end of the film. Steven Spielberg's homage to the Orsen Wells radio hoax and George Pal B movie is shoddy at best.,2005

3,"1. The ending was corny. How could his son have survived the napalmed field and end up in Boston? Why was his family still in Boston when the rest of the city was abandoned? It was nice, however, to have Gene Barry and Anne Robinson there! 2. There's no scathing political or philosophical commentary that the book or even the first movie had. The most damning commentary is Robbins' line that ""Occupation doesn't work."" Spielberg, you're so tough! One line does not make biting controversy. The book slants toward Marxism and attacks the Imperialism of the late nineteen/early twentieth centuries and religion. The original movie has a tribute to religion, which Spielberg annihilates in the opening invasion sequence. All this film has is... 3. A dummying down of society. We've taken intelligent characters as our protagonist to a crane operator! He has limited intelligence and limited character. I guess most people can relate to an ""everyman"" instead of an intellectual these days. This character is driven more on feeling than anything. However, the original book's narrator feels for his lost wife just as much as he uses his brains. Can't we have a juxtaposition of thought with emotion?",2005

Well this is one of those rare occasions when our persistence pays off. By most rationale judgements 'War of the Worlds' is superior entertainment. It is also a remarkably faithful adaptation of Well's novel, which after the Spielberg-produced 'Time Machine' of a few years back was a major concern. Some reviewers have accused the film of a stereotypical happy Hollywood ending; they obviously don't know the source, it is in fact very faithful. The homages to the 1953 film are appropriate and touching without being cute.",2005

We expect not to be forced to watch a plodding storyline and the most uninteresting aspect of alien invasion possible.

But Aeon Flux turns out to be a solid B+ grade SciFi flick that is inventive, stylistic, coherent and just plain fun to watch, particularly if you are partial to an athletic incarnation of Charlize Theron in Spandex. The film is well-paced. The main characters have depth and there is ""real emotion"" evident in the acting, always a plus for a SciFi film. There are a few things to complain about to be sure, but they're not crucial to the plot. I enjoyed the ""existential dilemma"" and ""identity crisis"" elements that made the story interesting.

Also there were clones in both, the series and the Movie (with one big difference, the idea of cloning was very much perverted using clones also as sex-toys. But thats about it.

Consider it an early Christmas gift from Hollywood, then, that ""Aeon Flux"" isn't nearly the affront to taste and decency one might expect, given the above.

And the classic moves, including the original opening schtick which I won't give away, will have you hooting if you are a fan of the original AF series. Highest marks for some of the most creative and surreal thingamabobs and the faithful high collared costumes from the original. Granted, it's no Gone with the Wind, but it doesn't deserve the bad rep the professional critics are giving it. It's pretty clever and sumptuous...don't just wait for the DVD, it's good mindless entertainment with a lot of WOW moments for the hard boiled sci fi fan. Charlize Theron does a good job though she's probably clearly out of her league here, and if anybody gets an Oscar Nom, it should be her hairdresser.",2005
7,"Charlize Theron cuts an exceptionally striking presence as the heroine of this smashing action-oriented fantasy involving a rebel fighter in 2415 whose assignment is to kill the leader of a totalitarian regime; turns out, she recognizes him as a man who once meant a great deal to her and finds she can't eliminate him (nor vice-versa), precipitating a coupe amongst his people. Though exceptionally flashy, this MTV production (based upon their animated series) has its roots steeped in the past, with a plot that admittedly recalls dozens of enemy-for-the-people adventures. Despite some intentionally amusing asides, the dialogue is fairly stilted (though there isn't much of it, which is ultimately a plus) and the editing is occasionally sharp though it eliminates things we should be seeing to clarify the narrative (like how Æon Flux manages to climb aboard and exit a flying monument). Frances McDormand's role as Theron's boss is left a bit sketchy (who does she get her orders from?) and her reluctance to give Æon even the slightest benefit of the doubt is perplexing. The action sequences are elaborately, entertainingly staged, and the crisp, expensive-seeming production gives us a glittering vision of the future (think ""Logan's Run"" on a modern budget). In the end, the film is more a tasty morsel than a satisfying meal--it may slip right out of your consciousness a day after you've seen it--but the misfits-as-rebels angle and the suave star-turns by Theron, Sophie Okonedo (as ever-faithful Sithandra, who has hands for feet) and handsome Marton Csokas (as Trevor Goodchild, who puts all the pieces in place) help make this an enjoyable ride. *** from ****",2007

8,"I never saw the animated series or the shorts, I might now. The movie is a Dystopian fantasy, that's not being marketed by Paramount as what it really is. Its movie relatives are not so much The Matrix or Equilibrium, but, in a way, Alex Proyas' Dark City (even if that movie is very different visually). Aeon Flux follows the rather mysterious titular character, who fights against the system in a future where what remains of humanity lives in a perfect and organized city state, apparently bright and serene, if one didn't notice that wall that's supposed to protect it from the wilderness that dominates the world outside of its borders. One mission will send the rather individualistic and beautiful Aeon to the very depth of the world she thinks she inhabits, to find out that, really, nothing is what it seems.....It's a bit of a cliché, as a sentence, but in this case really, nothing is. I loved the imagery of the movie. There are things here that are just beautiful to look at. The Relical, which is a sort of a temple, key of a lot of secrets of the movie, is truly something to behold. The movie has sudden and unexpected turns that brings it sometimes closer even to fantasy, which I really loved, and the character of The Handler, played by Frances Macdormand, well, it's just great.........an almost-God (or maybe it/she isn't), and the way it interacts with its/her followers it something that, in this day and age, is quite provocative and subversive. I also love how the movie indulges on issues that one wouldn't expect from the usual sci-fi thriller. Charlize Theron makes a compelling anti-heroine, sexy, lethal, aware of being both, but also more vulnerable than she thinks she is. She handles her action scenes, and the physical aspect of her character, really quite admirably. Marton Csokas, who plays the chairman of Bregna Trevor Goodchild, does a pretty good job too. I also really like in the cast Sophie Okonedo who plays a warrior with a soft spot for modifying her own body so that it can serve her better during her missions. Overall, I found Aeon Flux to be a haunting, exciting and stimulating piece of sci-fi. I loved it.",2005

It became an unwritten rule somewhere along the line that the heroine must scowl, sulk and be generally unhappy throughout the film. Elektra was really the worst with this.

1,"As a film student , the time comes along when you find something you truly love that you want to make into a film then suddenly some studio snatches it up. For me this was Aeon Flux, and after seeing it this weekend I am furious at the direction it went in.First the characters did not match persona's from the show , for example no way in hell do I remember the episode with Una, the translator being related to Aeon and more importantly being her sister! Second it seems to me no one making this movie ever watched the show , it felt like they watch a few trailers and then threw this film together. the story was incoherent and followed barely any plot line from any episode of this show.They touched on a few like the CLavius conspiracy and Siddahandtha with cloning but the movie was a total mess, Trevor wasn't even blonde and was never Aeon's husband , the character of Orion was never Trevor's brother but worked for him plus they did try to touch on the subject of the virus but not clearly enough. But the final cherry on the cake , was the fact that the director ended the film with Aeon and Trevor in a decade that resembled PRESENT DAY , that's when I went back to sleep because that pretty much show me no one even watched this show. To sum this all up , if you are a true Aeon Flux fan of the show do NOT GO SEE THIS MOVIE if you want to see some cool stunts and see Charlize in some skimpy clothes , this will be right up your alley",2005

One would figure, after 400 years of bad action movies, leaders people would learn: If a woman comes at you dressed in a tight jumpsuit, duck. This movie is rather boring, it didn't hold my interest one bit. There are better things to do then waste your time watching this...like watching paint dry.",2006

Oh and I need to make 10 lines? well pros and cons then. pros: good visuals, creative weapons. character development is good, and the last scene is just pure entertainment. cons: the story line is a bit sketchy, but its sci-fi so... what can you expect. the bad guy, well, isn't as bad as most bad guys are.

ALthough I believed the brothers were redneck bums, down on there luck, house breaking into losers...Jaime was the best suited to her character. She was picture perfect as the just a little too old, old time beauty queen tramp. She was a blast. In fact all the characters had features of them that stood out. I'm marking Tuesday night at 8 pm on my calender. This show (if one show is any indication...) is a keeper.",2005
10,"I began watching this show mostly for Jason Lee, who is a very talented and funny actor. I really thought that the plot would would only allow for maybe 20 episodes before the premise became used up. It is now on the third season and seems to be keeping strong. For the most part, the show sticks with its main premise. It is nice to see a comedy that doesn't all take place within 4 rooms like many shows on the air today. I think the constant introduction of new and clever characters really keeps it interesting. These are brought in order for there problems to be solve so that Earl can cross them off his list and move on to helping the next guy. It is unclear if the plot was originally thought up to allow a new character almost every episode, but it is really to its benefit, and the viewers.",2008
10,This show is way beyond awesome... ,2010
9,"""My Name is Earl"" has some unlikely ancestors. It belongs to a genre of television comedy/drama best described as ""Good works shows"". Popular in the eighties, when ""Highway to Heaven"" and ""Quantum Leap"" topped the charts, these shows concerned a normal, everyday guy or gal who, usually at the inspiration of some amorphous Higher Power, travelled from place to place attempting to make things Right. These shows drew their audiences in with their optimism, their conviction and their reminder that, however bad the world may seem, we have it in us all to make it better. Naturally, once the 90s dawned, they withered on the vine.",2007
9,"If somebody were to tell you that My Name is Earl was a show about dim- witted people doing crazy things, well, they wouldn't exactly be wrong. But it isn't the whole truth, either. When you make a show that centres around dim-witted people in a small town doing crazy things to pass the time, the general conclusion people would jump to would be that the show would be cliché and stupid. Who could blame them, that always appears to be the case. But My Name is Earl isn't only not stupid and cliché, it is absolutely brilliant, charming, genuinely hilarious, and loaded with twists and turns worthy of M. Night Shyamalan himself. Nothing is ever what it seems, and just when you think everything turned out peachy, a bigger, much more dastardly problem arises for our fiend-turned-friend.",2012
10,"When My Name is Earl first aired, it very quickly became one of my favourites. For a long time, it was to me one of the better and funnier shows airing on television, and I was really disappointed when it was cancelled. Jason Lee for starters is perfect as Earl, he is very funny and endearing all at once. All the other actors are engaging and have their chance to shine, but Lee was always the one to watch. My Name is Earl also had crisp production values, likable characters, interesting story lines and hilarious jokes and writing.",2011
10,I religiously watched two and a half men but it has gotten too raunchy for my kids. We love my name is earl. With FOX playing reruns I think that it has created more fans. It maybe smart to pick this one up. From the reviews I really think it could be successful. Give it a try. Please bring it back. Please. If not the need to come up with something because Abc has got some really great shows. It doesn't hurt to try. That network canceled it they maybe willing to sell the rights to it. Like some said the only problem I have with show is it was canceled too soon. My whole family loves it. Please try to bring it back to life. Adding it to the Monday night line up would only help ratings. Again it is down right funny yet family appropriate with the exception of a few episodes.,2011
10,"At a passing glance, My Name Is Earl would look like a show about a group of criminal rednecks. But there is far more to it than that.",2010
9,"I'd give this hilarious and original show a 10 if it wasn't for stupid ol' NBC canceling it on a cliffhanger. Now we'll never know who Earl Jr's real dad is! I will admit that the show got more and more gross every season(like in the episode ""Nature's Game Show"", Randy devours undelivered human organs), but that's no reason to cancel such a great show. I guess they canceled it because the ratings were terrible. Typically, people have no taste in television; they'd rather watch all the reality TV crap. In my opinion almost all of the really good shows are canceled before their time, but, then again, if I think it's really good, I don't think it should ever end. I know I sound like a complete nerd whining about frivolous crap such as TV shows, but I really hate it when shows are canceled on cliffhangers.",2009
8,This is a show that doesn't just make you laugh... it makes you happy. Seeing Earl do good deeds and change people's lives is fantastic. Seeing the relationship Earl has with his brother is very touching as well. I'm a true sucker for a redemption tale. And this is most likely my favourite ever.,2008
10,I watched the pilot episode of MNIE when it debuted and was hooked on the show ever since it. I was already a big Jason Lee fan since we was in movies like Mallrats and Chasing Amy.,2012
9,"And yes, My Name is Earl is literally about trailer trash, and hilariously so.",2009
10,"Not only has this show actually made me laugh out loud really hard for the first time in ten years of watching ridiculously unfunny sitcoms (I barely watch T.V. now because of the tripe filled with commercials and I never watched reality crap), It has the best message on T.V. Shows today are either unfunny or vulgarly funny with no moral message. Earl has changed all that. Although bits are for adults, it's a small price to pay for the key to making our country better (""Do good things and good things happen. Do bad things and bad things happen."" So simple yet effective). Jason Lee has always been funny in my mind and when I saw he was a producer I knew the show would retain that special quirk it has. Jamie Pressly hotter than ever and Nadine Velazquez (Catalina) looks great by the pool in her bikini.",2007
10,"The others do a good job gushing about the movie. Sure we're fans and bound to like the movie more than the usual fare, but those looking for an original and thrilling movie experience, this will shock and amaze. The Firefly world introduced a fantasy home for many of us, with characters we truly cared about and dilemmas we could get behind. The best way to describe it is to take the best aspects of the Han Solo elements of the original Star Wars, and build a world around that. There's no grand theme or clear cut good and evil. There's just a band of fugitives trying to make their way in a dangerous sky. It's something folks can relate to, although most of us won't be in a space battle or fighting psychotic creatures anytime soon. The point of the name Serenity is the name of the ship, though in a deeper sense that's what our characters are in search of. Finding freedom and a home, and that's what the ship represents to them, and to the fans. So you understand why so many are so excited about this dinky little scifi flick. ",2005
10,"From start to finish there are no wasted moments. All your emotions will be engaged. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll gasp in shock. What you won't be is bored. Don't plan on being able to take a bathroom break or get more soda and popcorn. You won't want to miss a second of this one.",2005
10,"Instead of going into a long, drawn out review, let me sum up ""Serenity"" by saying that 1) no fans of ""Firefly"" will be disappointed, and 2) Whedon does a good enough job laying out the backstory that newbies to the Firefly universe will have no trouble figuring things out and enjoying the heck out of the movie.",2005
10,"Before you start reading this, you have to know where I'm coming from. I'm a huge fan of Joss Whedon's work, was a loyal follower of 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' and 'Angel' and really got into 'Firefly' (on which this movie is based) and the whole browncoat phenomenon as well. So I was, you might just say, pretty much predestined to like this movie. But, not so. Whedon-fans are a pretty critical bunch, most of the time, and no one went into this thing with higher expectations than us. And to have those expectations be met in such a way as Serenity does, is very special indeed.",2005
9,"***NO SPOILERS*** I saw the movie at a sneak preview in Houston, TX on 6/23/05. I was just happy that we were getting more of these characters and this setting.",2005
8,My husband and I first saw this movie after just reading these excellent reviews and not knowing anything else about the movie or characters. We are both sci-fi fans.,2006
10,"I love this film. I'm not a huge fan of Sci-Fi, but Serenity blew me away. The characters are engaging, there's great humour in the script, and the storyline kept me interested. Just wish I knew what they were saying when they speak Chinese! Watching this got me into Firefly. It's such a shame it was cancelled. Love the crew, the universe joss Whedon created and the little details like their slang. The ship is not too slick and perfect, which adds a great deal of character, and really enables viewers to identify more with the crew, a group of underdogs in a tumbledown ship trying to evade the authorities. The Reavers are frankly rather scary. Overall, this film comes off very well, you really feel the chemistry between the crew as well. Brilliant!",2007
10,".. which is some sort of a record. Makes you wonder what the armchair reviewers are saving the ""10"" for ...? A sign from above? Godfather XIX? Here are the unvarnished facts, purely for the historical record. Joss ""Long Arc"" Whedon was doing his thing, happily building a show (Firefly) that, typical of Whedon, was getting better and better and better. Then they took his show away. Now, Joss has a history of dealing with people who take his toys away (see the first horrific Buffy feature, and his reaction thereto). Somehow, using the Whedon magic, he was able to gather all his notes for the 10-year arc of Firefly and use them surgically, in this film on a single strike. Ah, what a film. Understand that Joss is one of the greatest living writers of our generation, and for him this was ""personal"" -- he wanted to show the world what they almost missed. From the opening sequence to the last frame, this is a perfect movie. Citizen Kane watch your back. This is flawless. It should be studied in film school and buried in a time capsule with the original Brylcreem formula. The recycling of an already perfect ensemble cast from Firefly was expected, but the addition of Chiwetel Ejiofor, who steals every frame of every scene he is in, was inspired. As as I hinted before, if you did not give this a 10, you need to seriously rethink whether Talking Pictures is your preferred form of entertainment.",2013
10,"I saw this movie twice in preview screenings in May and June, and I cannot emphasize enough how rewarding it is to see this movie more than once. The first time through is such an amazing ride that it is impossible to soak everything up. Subsequent viewings really give you whole new levels of appreciation. There's SO much going on here, and it's amazingly good.",2005
7,"I watched the whole DVD set of Firefly a few months ago and was hoping that this movie would be an improvement in terms of scale and effects. Sadly, I was disappointed. Firefly (aka Serenity) is a TV series and should remain a TV series.",2005
5,"I first became interested in FIREFLY, the series, and SERENITY, through the early trailers shown back in May. AFter seeing the trailer I rented the series, loved it, and since purchasing the DVD have seen it many times. I really looked forward to the movie. Unfortunately, the movie didn't live up to the trailer and was mediocre at best. None of the elements that made the series so enjoyable are present. Gone are deep character development and the lively interaction among the crew members. Book and Inara are really just cameos,while Kaylee, Wash, and even Simon have little to do. The heart of FIREFLY was the relationship between Simon and River, but it's little explored here. Humor and hints of romance are, for the most part, absent. The plot is action-heavy and really is just the crew trying to escape from Reavers. The entire rationale behind the Alliance's desperate need to eliminate River Tam is uninteresting and the explanation for the existence of the Reavers is truly lame. It was much more interesting to have the Reavers be humans who'd gone wild on the outer rim. I kept waiting for the ""two-by-two, hands-of-blue"" creeps to show up but they never did. Finally, the operative's bizarre about-face at the end makes no sense. Seeing this poor feature film makes me love the FIREFLY series even more. I was hooked at the end of the first half, when Mal opens up the crate carrying River. There will be no trilogy here.",2005
5,"Maybe this movie makes a lot more sense if you have spent many hours being entranced by the series. Seeing a few trailers, the obvious quality and imagination of the CGI, and being a sucker for Sci-Fi, I had high hopes for this movie, but as my Summary goes...",2005
10,"When Firefly was canceled, a small part of me died. With Serenity, I'm feeling wonderfully whole again. Serenity is a grand, sweeping finale to Firefly and with any luck, the beginning of a new film franchise. Like Firefly, Serenity just plain rocks. Intense storytelling, amazing visuals, sharp-as-a-tack dialog and the prettiest darned crew ya ever seen. These are Big Damned Heroes for sure! The Operative is a fantastic new character in this wonderful verse. Serenity answers many of Firefly's lingering questions while leaving others wide open for the next adventure. And I for one can't wait for that. Watch Firefly, see Serenity, tell your friends. Lather, rinse, repeat. Any questions? Shiny.",2005
5,"Just to give warning, I know nothing of the television show. I didn't even know it was based on a show until a co-worker of mine told me it was. On to what counts: I really don't know what people found so fantastic about this movie. I mean... it sure wasn't as bad as The Ring 2 (don't get me started on that one), but apart from some decent visuals and a fair share of comic relief, there was nothing at all I found to be the slightest bit enjoyable about this movie. For starters, it was WAY too long for it's own good. They could have probably compressed it to about an hour and 15 minutes and it would have been a little better. Every five minutes I found myself tilting my head back in my seat and sighing/grunting due to complete boredom. I constantly sat there asking myself ""how are the people I'm here with staying awake?"".",2005
6,"I'm a fan of the original Firefly series, and had high hopes for Serenity based on the reviews. Sadly, it was not nearly as good as I expected.",2005
5,"I saw this after being skeptical, but seeing the high rating on IMDb. I've now come to realize this is most certainly what is known as the ""fanboy"" effect. This movie has a meandering plot, a less-than-stellar conclusion, and is filled with goofy, pointless dialog. Something I enjoyed about the show was how varied the plot lines were and how the characters interacted differently in every episode. In this movie, everyone was very one-dimensional extremes of their characters in the show, and they didn't develop at all throughout the whole thing! The plot just sort of went nowhere until you found out the big ""oh no"" about the alliance (which didn't seem all that big to me...). Overall this movie was a total bust, and I'm embarrassed that I took my girlfriend with me to see it, in the hopes that I could quell her constant mockery about the fact that I wanted to see it, and clearly I failed in that regard.",2005
9,"I have to say, while reading all of the negative reviews here, I was merely confirmed in my observation that most people are idiots. Quite frankly, if you don't get this movie, good on yer, go back to watching the standard mono-syllabic fare. What this movie provided was a non-standard, shades-of-gray character study. The focus was not on big-budget effects, or glitzy bits of teeny-bopper fluff. It was about a story. It reminded me of how I felt when I watched the REAL Star Wars (not the fake stuff that is out now). People have different ways of handling things that challenge them mentally. Some are able to incorporate the new perspectives into their lives, while others call it ""boring"" or ""seen it"" when all they are doing is protecting their two fragile brain cells from expansion.",2006
8,"First off, I want to say that I loved this movie. It's got intense action sequences, a good plot,some humor, likable characters, fantastic special effects, hardly ever a dull moment,and oh yeah... it's a total babe-fest!!! I must confess I'm new to the whole Firefly universe.I don't watch much TV so I'd never even heard of the TV show. So until watched this DVD, to me,Firefly was nothing but a dumpy little American made car. I rented this movie with no expectations whatsoever; maybe that's the reason I enjoyed this movie so much. I can't speak for the fans of the series, but if you enjoy well-made sci-fi, then you'll love this cool little movie.",2006
9,"I was, upon first viewing of this film, completely oblivious to the existence of any of the characters, concepts, and etcetera featured within it: I was, as some of us Firefly fans refer to it, a ""Firefly virgin"".",2007
10,"I was lucky enough to catch one of the pre-screenings of Serenity in Spring (thank you Universal!). I let the cinema with a lump in my throat and a feeling that I had just witnessed something special. A phoenix from the ashes, if you will. Serenity is simply an emotional roller-coaster, especially given its ilk in the sci fi genre. Joss has truly created something special for the fans of the show, and for fans of clever storytelling. The movie is an analogy of the show as a whole and can best be summed up by the infamous quote from Mal in the TV series, ""We've done the impossible, and that makes us mighty."" See. This. Film. Watch Firely first if you want to get the maximum effect.",2005
10,"I saw this at a sneak preview, WHOA. Joss really outdid himself here, this movie is funny, has tons of action and has several great layered characters, oh and the special effects are pretty good too. There is even a brief intro that catches up those who haven't seen Firefly. Great movie. What I really liked about this movie is that the characters are all so colorful and textured, I believe this universe that Joss Wheedan has created could become the next big franchise like Star Trek. My recommendation is see it at least three times and take all your friends with you each time, that way we can get the trilogy made.",2005
9,"Possibly the best science-fiction movie to come along since The Empire Strikes Back--better, in my opinion than The Matrix and other recent flicks.",2007
7,"I tried desperately to avoid getting my hopes elevated beyond reason, but it was to no avail. I have watched the entire Firefly series twice over the last two years, and had always hoped that it would somehow return. Firefly was one of the most recent examples of an intelligent, challenging, sci-fi show getting mismarketed and canceled by network TV. Firefly was a western adventure set in space with a compelling plot and bold, very likable characters. Serenity is its reprise in a full-feature film. Still, Serenity endeavors to introduce non-fans to its characters and major story arc in a very clever and subtle way, so that fans and non-fans alike can appreciate it completely. Those familiar with the saga of River and her alliance pursuers will enjoy the consistency with which the characters are portrayed and the development of her character into what she could have realized had the show been permitted to fully mature.",2005
10,"If there is any reason that i still want to direct when i grow up, its because of this movie.",2007
10,"I first saw a preview for this film at Wizard World Chicago a few months before it came out. Prior to this I had never seen Firefly or even heard anything about it. I might have seen it on the preview channel or something, but I never got around to it. After seeing the preview however, I turned away from the little pirated copy on the little TV, turned to my cousin who was with me and said, ""I have no idea what that film is about, but I want to see it."" Unfortunately I was a little busy that summer and didn't get around to seeing it until a good while later. I saw the first 10 minutes of it on Youtube and was hooked. I was obsessed and so excited to see it I could have used a change of shorts.",2007
10,"This is a review of Series 1 and Series 2 (total of 16 episodes) of the French police investigation TV series called 'Engrenages' in French but called 'Spiral' in English. ('Engrenages' does not actually mean 'spiral' but is not particularly translatable. It embodies a complex concept within a single word, referring to a vast web of interlocked and enmeshed gearings of events and personalities, which perfectly describes this incredibly complex and intriguing body of simultaneous and interrelated stories.) This is a sensationally compulsive and gripping series, full of well-rounded leading characters whose evolving personal tales are just as interesting as the crimes they are perpetually solving. As is usual with French crime films and series, they struggle against the octopus of French political corruption on a continual basis, as they cope with crime after crime and try to do their jobs against all the obstacles artificially created by powerful 'high-ups' and stony-faced bureaucrats. What is so remarkable about this series is the extraordinarily vivid and compelling characters which are created, and the magnificent acting. It is not really accurate to describe this as a 'police' investigation series, because under the French system, judges, magistrates, and prosecutors work side by side with the detectives on a daily and hourly basis, and this is what makes this series so fascinating. Major characters also include corrupt defence lawyers who are in the pockets of drug dealers and thugs. There is only one thing wrong with this series, and that is that someone high up in the production team (writer, director, or producer) is responsible for a disturbing and revolting streak of sadistic necrophilia which recurs time and again. We have to sit through numerous prolonged sequences where the camera lovingly dwells on mutilated or burnt corpses, which have clearly been expensively and meticulously produced by the props department. This is part of the contemporary trend of 'being tough on screen' by showing pathologists at work, a sickness indulged in also in British television at the present time, but really it is disgusting and whoever is responsible for including all that in this otherwise wonderful series should be taken to the nearest vivisection room and done away with. The main star of this series is the extraordinarily versatile and talented actress Caroline Proust. In the first couple of episodes she was a bit up tight as she settled into the role, but by the end of Series 2 she had so grown into it that she was spontaneity itself, and very endearing as she jumped up and down like a gleeful child when cleared in an internal investigation. As a detective captain, she epitomizes the dilemma of the modern woman, forced to do a man's job in dangerous circumstances and be as tough as a man, while coping with love pangs, loneliness, personal isolation and no lasting partner, dreaming of having kids but knowing there will be no chance, and frustrated at being the victim of continual gender bias and persecution by men who view themselves as alpha males. She is a delightful and sympathetic presence on the screen. The other woman dominant in the series is Audrey Fleurot, an eerily beautiful redhead covered in tiny freckles who epitomises the descent into evil. In episode after episode, we watch her progressively sell her soul to the devil as an increasingly corrupt advocate, betraying everything and everyone for money. Rarely has a reptile in human form been so successfully and compulsively portrayed. Really, Fleurot has achieved classic status as a villainess, and you simply cannot take your eyes off her because she is so wonderfully strange. My favourite character in the series is Judge Roban ('Monsieur Juge'), an investigating magistrate played by Philippe Duclos. He is quirky, eccentric, brilliant, intense, and a perfect joy to watch. The main investigating prosecutor ('Monsieur Procureur') is played by Gregory Fitoussi. He is a bit of a French 'pretty boy', ever such a good person, but also psychologically limited. Also compulsively watchable, exasperating and endearing at the same time, is the remarkable Thierry Godard, who plays the police detective Gilou. There are countless fascinating supporting characters, such as Guillaume Cramoisan, who plays Benoit Faye, the childhood friend of Fitoussi who is always getting mixed up in something dodgy and thinks all rules exist to be bent. Then there is the chilling psychopathic pervert who is personal assistant to a minister, Arnaud Laborde, played by Scali Delpeyrat, Daniel Duval who plays the ghastly and horrifying Me Szabo, Reda Kateb who plays the terrifying drug dealer Aziz, and the gallery of characters just goes on and on. Many of the Arabs and Berbers in the stories are amazingly good as actors. There is never a dull moment for hour after hour, the tension never slackens for an instant, and Series 3 must be impatiently awaited by hordes of viewers, amongst which I number myself as a dedicated enthusiast. This series is really an incredible achievement. The 'creators' are Alexandra Clert and Guy-Patrick Sainderichin; this is her first project, but he is a highly experienced French TV writer with a background also as an actor. They have been assisted by Virginie Brac and three other writers and there have been four directors, all splendidly creative. Everyone is excellent, and everything is superb except for all those horrible corpses. Interwoven throughout the series are highly intriguing miniature stories of puzzling crimes which are solved side by side with the main continuing investigations, in order to show the complexity of detective work, and how life is never dull for an instant. These are never just padding but are always interesting, and often bizarre. Everything about this series is highly charged, full of astounding energy and creativity, and it is really a triumph of sustained television drama. The amount and level of talent shown by everyone connected with this series is astonishing. The series really does deserve lots of awards.",2010

10,"Engrenages is a Paris-based police procedural making no concessions to the easy-viewing requirements which deaden its English speaking equivalents. Dowdy police, incompetent lawyers, crims in grey shading into the deepest black. Acting, camera-work, lighting and print quality is imaginative and thorough. Each episode had an exemplary cliff-hanging or shock ending. The rather delayed and somewhat cryptic sub-titles make it tough for non-native speakers, but it has done wonders for my bog-French. Sheer pleasure: the news that they are shooting a new series is excellent. Lets hope it goes out again on BBC3 or 4 - much too demanding, even for BBC2.",2006
8,"I stumbled across this looking for to improve my French, I've ended up being gripped by the characters. There is a unifying theme but every week there is more blood and seediness and sub-plotted nastiness. It's enough to put one off Paris, however, you do get a vivid impression of reality as in ""NYPD"" and such work as Steve Bochco is famous for. The photographic effect is nearly monochrome, in keeping with the subject matter. Believe me this not a laugh a minute show, but it is a correction to the romantic view of France that Francophiles like me have. As a cop show it works, although there are enormous differences in legal procedures from those I know. There is also a cynical view of the wielding of power, both judicial and political. Aside from the action there is an indefinable Parisian gloss on the actors, it's no wonder falling into bed happens so easily, all the main leads are good looking and even the cops have a certain ""je ne sais quoi"".I am hooked on this series to find out what is going to happen to the main characters both good and bad.",2006
10,"The title in French ""Engrenages"" literally means 'gears'. However this word is also used figuratively to mean 'complications' (apparently by Jean Paul Sartre). The English title ""Spiral"" doesn't carry anything like the same power. The story is immensely complex and dark with interlocking relationships, corruption and deceit. How does ""Spiral"" even begin to hint at this? I would have liked a better attempt at an English title. Some of my own suggestions are ""Convolutions"", ""Wheels within Wheels"" even ""Enmeshed"" or ""Cogs"". Can anyone else come up with a better idea? Apart from this quibble, I am completely gripped by the series and have had to reschedule my life around the late programming. I never fall asleep during the program and on occasion lie awake thinking about it afterwards.",2006
8,"This 8 part French detective serial is going out un-publicisied on BBC3 in the UK. It has some resemblances to the very darkest American cop shows, but is really grimmer and dirtier. There are unifying themes and tangents which may work into the main plot. It's impossible to explain how different things are from a UK police drama. The legal system is very different and it's fascinating to follow - who has power to do what to whom. The Police and Prosecutors aren't exactly corrupt, but in a way they can't help being. The police look like criminals and work out of what seems like a run-down basement. A brilliantly convoluted thriller, with all the fascination of a really alien legal system, Paris backdrop, washed out colours, general decay. Final episode on BBC next week, but you should be able to see it somewhere. I see from Amazon France that there's a second season.",2006

10,"Forget formulaic shows posing as violent, dark and gritty. Spiral shows how the genre should be done. The French title means cogs or gears which trap the characters into ever more convoluted situations. No good & bad here - the naively honest prosecutor facing his first job is drawn ever deeper into a conspiracy which forces him to make increasingly dangerous compromises. The initial mystery underpinning the entire series, unfolds each week to offer us more fascinating pieces of the puzzle. Even the weekly murder - often solved within the episode - has repercussions that continue on. This is compulsive viewing  the end of the hour feels like ten minutes.",2008
10,"This French Crime drama series is sheer quality and if you are using the sub titles it adds to your concentration and the suspense. The French judicial system is very different from the UK and USA with examining judges being involved with the Police in investigations. Some great characters and great plots combine to make this a series not to be missed. The standard of acting is brilliant with each individual character creating a sub plot. All are very different with strengths, weaknesses and skeletons in the closet. You also have the machinations of promotion, positions and control within the Police and Judiciary to add extra interest I have seen all four series and cannot wait for the next.",2013
10,"Some have criticized Spiral-I know not why, but I was hooked in the first few minutes. It came back to mind when I watched the first episode of ""Jo"", a French-made policier set in Paris, but with English dialogue, some dubbed, some spoken. Bad idea. I couldn't stand it. I'd rather watch French actors speak French in an un-clichéd story as in Spiral. What makes Spiral work is the utterly believable idiosyncratic characters, and how they manage to warp the cases they work on as their lives warp around them. A dedicated woman detective who happily shags every male who joins the murder squad without ever changing her shirt; an undercover detective who manages to succeed at his job while becoming addicted to heroin; a quirky judge who makes common cause with a prosecutor to shoehorn cases through the French judicial system in spite of the laws. There's more, but the point is, it's all Paris, all French, and it acts like it. The stories, the motivations, the legal system-none of it is like a US crime series. I loved Law and Order, which Spiral most resembles, but only superficially. It is about the French judicial system, as L&O was about the American system, but there the similarity ends. The two systems are distinct, and there's not much about Spiral that is familiar. I love it.",2016

10,"Read about Engrenages and got hooked from the first episode.I only saw season 4, the only one available on Netflix, but could not stop watching it. I grew up in France and French TV dramas are usually boring compared to their US counterparts. This series is different and so much better than the packaged US shows (CSI comes to mind) because no one is completely clean, no one owns the truth, no happy endings. This looks like real life and goes against the stereotype of cool, beautiful Paris. The depressing, ""noir"", side of the show is actually a real depiction of Paris, a grey city, with grey weather and depressed people (I lived there too). The grime estates and sinister characters - including the stars of the show - reflect the troubled state of French society at this point in history. The depiction of the French judicial system is extremely accurate and can make British and American audiences shiver. This is great TV with great actors (you love to hate and hate to love Capitaine Laure)and the language spoken there is nothing like what you learned at school - but certainly more like what's spoken on the street. One word: Bravo!!",2015
10,"The review about forgetting all your previous concepts of TV police is on the mark. Even Bluebloods, which I love and which reminds you that the police are people too, has slips now and then. But Engrenages has you right next to all the people involved, trying to make sense out of what you see, wondering if involvement leads to danger, questioning whether what they're saying is true or an attempt to divert or entrap. I am not a viewer in a chair watching them. I'm there with them, almost through the whole episode. There has never been any other show where I was drawn in so completely. I look in amazement, going back to the days when there was only the radio and movies for me to watch, wondering how, with so many brilliant writers, directors and actors, nothing like this was ever done before. A remarkable tribute to French creativity.",2015

8,"Peculiar strong personalities, naturalistic depiction of crimes, officers with serious personal issues, racketeering and nepotism in politics, etc. - these are the features most of the world's crime fans attribute to Danish and Swedish crime series. But the first episodes of Engrenages appeared around 9 years ago! Having seen all the seasons by now, I agree with them who believe that it should deserve far more attention than so far, more promotion and broadcasting on major channels. Realistic atmosphere, strong acting (particularly Caroline Proust as police captain Laure Berthaud, Philippe Duclos as judge François Roban, Audrey Fleurot as lawyer Joséphine Karlsson), versatile and intertwined events make the series enjoyable to watch - in spite of rather so-so start; unlike most of longer series, here we can say that Series 1 is least interesting and most uneven, although still better than related US series. For me as a non-francophone, it was pleasant to listen to the French language and get to know the problems in French society.",2014
9,"I never give 10, but this is superior TV. We watch it two episodes at a time, evening after evening. It is riveting. Some of the action sequences, usually police raids, are deftly directed (including by a woman director) and have you on the edge of your seat. Again, in the fourth season, the remarkable Caroline Proust (who plays Laure Berthaud) is tormented by a love triangle. The magnificent (fore and aft) Audrey Fleurot (who plays Josephine Karlsson) manages to get herself flung into prison. The nice guy (and longest-standing character) Fred Bianconi (who plays Fromentin) gets shot and starts losing his mind. Gilou (Thierry Godard) gets in another hopeless scrape. Yes, it's all going on in Spiral and the audience can't get enough. Okay, Breaking Bad had its moments, but the story got a bit ridiculous and never showed any teamwork the way Spiral does. I just hope they can talk Caroline Proust into another season, along with Audrey and all the rest. I can't wait.",2013

To all the critics, yes, there are a lot of explosions, gunfire, unrealistic battles, plenty of times where you think ""they MUST have been hit by a bullet by now..there is noo effin way..."", and over-dramatized violence, but there's plenty of good stuff too that should not be ignored.",2010
1,"Where do I start? It looked promising, it had Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt co-starring in this picture: what could do wrong? Praised as one of 2005 sleeper hits, I never got the chance to see this movie at the cinema, but last month I managed to rent a copy of this movie on DVD. I like action movies(especially the late 80's/early 90's movies), so naturally I was excited, 2 hours later I was sitting on my chair wandering what happened and thinking: were they talking about another movie? Did I see a different movie? For those who don't know, Mr and Mrs Smith is about a married couple whom both are hit men working for different hit men companies without suspecting each other's secret lives. The premise alone sounds far-fetched, but the start is bad we are «introduced» to the characters who are comfortably sitting on couches both talking to the therapist about their ever decreasing romance,I sensed that something was terribly wrong when by the end of that extended scene I was feeling sleepy and clueless. I had no idea who were these characters, nor did I care for them. Eventually after they find out about their secret lives after a failed hit, they try to take each other out, only in the end to find out that by telling the truth it makes their marriage jolt back. It's so sweet when they settle their differences that you almost forget they are both hit men and that they don't seemed troubled by the mere though that they both killed for a living, but yeah, their marriage was going down the drain so t doesn't matter if they kill for a living(I'm being sarcastic). Even with all the action I was bored out of my skull nor did I find any of the gags funny. And wow, the way Columbia is portrayed in the movie is an example of scriptwriters being dumb as heck, why didn't Angelina Jolie say anything about this, after she works for the UN and all? The major insult was after they made up, their companies put a bounty on them and decided to track them down and take them out, it's just too bad their aiming and their larger numbers couldn't compare to Brad and Angelina's super-human speed,resistance,agility and superior marksmanship. Did I mention I had no idea whom were they exactly figthing against? We never know who they work for nor who employed them? They just randomly pop out to fight them. Oh and don't get me started on the characters, watching Brad Pitt and Angelina on this movie is painful, they have no chemistry whatsoever, Brad mumbles all his lines and Angelina is a predictable tomboy stereotype and one-trick pony. Vince Vaughn's jokes all fall flat, and why is that actor called The Tank? I've seen pizza delivery boys with a scarier look.To call these characters ""comic book characters"", is an insult to them. But why Brad? Why Angelina? Arnold Scharznegger(who can't act) and Jamie Lee Curtis(who's hardly a sex symbol)did so much better in True Lies. In the end, the movie is boring, childish, unfunny and a waste of time, being nothing more then tabloid fodder for two over-hyped actors. Ranks as one of the worst actions movies out there, and I've seen xXx 2: State of the Union and Alone in the Dark. The rental cost me 1.5 and I would have felt cheated even if it was for free.",2006
1,"My God, is everyone who reviews this movie here brain damaged? This movie's plot crosses the believability line halfway through the feature and never returns.

7,"I saw an advance screening of this movie tonight, and I must say it far exceeded my expectations! Of course, due to the stars involved I knew there'd be sex appeal. And due to the advertising I knew there'd be plenty of stuff ""gettin' blowed up real good."" But what I wasn't expecting was the tongue in cheek jokes, dark humor, and respectable plot twist! Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie will only fuel rumors of their relationship with their performances - their chemistry on screen is scintillating, to say the least. The allure of each actor as an individual is undeniable, but when they're together, whether getting busy or getting pummeled, the screen fairly sizzles. It's a popcorn, Hollywood movie, of course, and you'll have to get past the fact that the two leads are the only two among many professional killers who seem to be decent shots! But the action is kickin, the acting well above par, the leads luminous, the plot is lots of fun, and the laughs are plenty. Enjoy! I sure did...",2005

2,"What a terrible movie. It reminded me a lot of ""America's Sweethearts"" because that starred A-list Hollywood actors trying to be funny in completely predictable and ridiculous situations. This movie is exactly the same, it has nothing new to offer. It is very standard formulaic fare, a popcorn movie of the worst sort, which is not even in the least bit amusing. Yes, both Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are attractive actors, but that is about it. The rest of the movie is a waste and makes no sense at all.",2006
4,"Cheesy story, boring as-if action that's been done a million times, what else can I say, just lame Hollywood garbage at its finest. I'm glad I got to see this for free, because it was really a waste of time. There is only one good part, and that is when Mr. Smith hits a guy in the head with a golf club. Other than than the movie does not offer anything more than a few shots of Lip Lady (Jolie) in fish nets for all the guys who think she is hot (c'mon, she really is just plain freakish with all that plastic surgery) and some shots of Brad Pitt with his shirt off for all the 14 year old girls who will probably go see this movie for that reason alone. This movie would have been better if they would have actually killed each other, and thus, brought the film to an end after about 40 minutes. I gave Mr. & Mrs. Smith a 4/10 because at least it was produced well and had some decent stunts and special fx, but other than that, I would say it is almost as bad the The Matrix 2 and 3.",2005
3,"The film was a big disappointment. The actors and actresses did their jobs well - and they certainly are 'beautiful people' for the screen. But the screenplay was weak. The dialog was limited.

1,"OK, here is the deal. I know that a lot of films today are directed by terrible directors(Douglas Liman) with no sense of vision and/or talent, and scripts for those films are written by hapless dingbats(Simon Kinberg) who lack any spark or, once again, talent, even though they speak the Queen's English. Today such collaborations are the norm and most times they are praised by gullible audiences but Mr & Mrs Smith has managed to ""raise"" the bar slightly, setting the new standard for future films to ""reach"". No doubt the aforementioned audiences will love this film, despite the fact the movie is terrible in all ways imaginable.",2005

Effective soundtrack, too.",2005
1,"If you are a ""die hard"" fan of either Brad Pitt or Angelina Jolie - go see this film. Otherwise stay away. There is no plot, suspense or action - unless you consider ""wasting a house and later a store"" action. It appears (to me) as if the main ""draw"" for this film was the fact that Brad and Angelina were dating each other - rather than the movie itself. Although this film was billed as an ""action/comedy"" - it managed to fail on both counts. If you truly want to see a great comedy film by the same title - please watch Alfred Hitchcock's ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" (his only comedy). In summary - it was disappointing to see the talents of these two great actors wasted on an unbelievable and mediocre script.",2005
1,"After all the hype for this movie one expects from a seasoned director with two star actors to at least provide a movie that is not truly dull. It has to be an all time slowest and dullest ever Start of any movie I've watched.. it was painful to watch, and i love to watch both actors but still it could have used about half of it edited out to move the pace up a notch. Then it climbs at an old man pace to the actual plot and the chemistry still remains so distant that one wonders if they are reading lines from a card for some commercial, and nobody i mean Nobody in the picture is realistic or not from some beauty contest with overdone make up except for Vince Vaughan who was so out of place and the only comedy relief that should have been written into half the movie because Brad Pitt played his part so straight that nobody laughed thru half of the movie, at Anything. It was a full house and no laughs... but hey.. at least Jolie is amazingly beautiful so thank god she was cast for eye candy.. but she also played the part to her normal level of acting... which hasn't been anything substantial in a looong time.",2005
10,"In the end of the day, ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" is a classic Hollywood production: big guns, fast paced action sequences, lots of punch lines that'll thrill the audience, and two stunningly beautiful lead actors (who somehow remain beautiful, despite all the mass destruction going around them throughout the second half of the film). The pre-release buzz regarding the dynamic duo's on screen chemistry is absolutely true: as a pair, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are even more sparkling and charismatic then when they are apart (on screen wise, I mean; don't know what's happening off-screen). As a matter of fact, I could have sworn I actually saw them shining during several parts of the film. Add that to director Doug Liman's unique, if controversial, directing techniques (with many of the stylistic action scenes followed by melodramatic music and sharp camera movements) - and you've got yourself a certified crowd pleaser, and the best action film to come on screen... well, since Liman's ""The Bourne Identity"" three years ago.",2005

There are no ideas, no acting, and apparently no writers, action sequences are completely idiotic and poorly put together.",2006
7,"I have only watched the theatrical cut of this one, but I thought it was nice. I hoped for more (although it is well rounded, beginning - end connection, of course I'm talking about the psychiatrist), but what I saw was satisfying enough. I mean what can you do with a crazy premise like that? Two hit-mans in love with each other, but both don't know what profession the other one is doing ... no wait that was the plot outline for ""Assasins"" with Antonio Banderas and Sylvester Stallone ... ;o) ",2007
8,"This movie will never win an Oscar, but it still surprised me and became my favorite summer movie this year. The plot, as in all good summer comedies, is simple. Two guys who crash weddings to pick up woman have zany adventures and learn a little something along the way. The real fun of this movie is in the actors, who deliver their performances perfectly. Owen Wilson is the aging California surfer type who may be ready to move on with his life. Vince Vaughn is his best friend who frequently acts like a spoiled, horny child but is actually a good guy. Christopher Walken is the slightly scary father of the love interest. So if you have seen Wilson in Shanghai Noon and Vaughn in Swingers and Walken in, well almost anything he has ever made, then you have seen these characters before. But still, they just work well together here. The movie contains just enough real emotion to keep you caring and enough absurdity and broad physical comedy to keep you laughing. This isn't Shakespeare, but it is funny. Highly recommend.",2005
8,"An excellent comedy, Vince Vaughn is a gifted comedian. He kept ""Old School"" going, was the only light in a dismal ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"", and had a terrific debut lead in ""Swingers"". I highly recommend people considering this movie, to watch the extras on the DVD; there is a karaoke scene at an Asian wedding which will have you rolling. It is a shame it was cut from the movie, but as the director's comments stated, ""They just couldn't find a place where it would fit."" I was very pleasantly surprised at the number of times I laughed out loud, a rarity for me while watching comedies. The lines were witty, the delivery was crisp, and the jokes were mostly new and fresh. Rachel McAdams was stunning, an excellent casting choice to play the object of Owen Wilson's desire. Despite the more or less rehashed plot (two guys lie about themselves to meet women, only to find that they now have a dilemma when they find 2 they really like), the film is nonetheless novel and original. There are a number of obviously stereotypical characters, (drunken grandmother, artistic introverted son, psychotic cheating boyfriend, immoral mother, powerful father), but they work in this film. Particularly the grandmother, who is prone to drunken scatological exclamations, had me laughing my head off. It was quite unexpected.",2006

This hilarious film was directed by David Dobkin.",2014
8,"Wedding Crashers was a hilarious comedy mainly because of the great performances by Owen Wilson and especially Vince Vaughn. Director David Dobkin is admirable in making this movie about two best friends who enjoy to spend their time crash weddings and picking up chicks. Owen Wilson and Vincent Vaughn both made this movie worth seeing because of their great comic chemistry with each other. Their scenes together are worth seeing it alone. The film also stars a more restrained Christopher Walken, Rachel McAdams, Isla Fisher, and Bradley Cooper who are equally impressive as the supporting characters. The rest of the cast are okay in their roles as well. A few of the supporting actors provide some comic relief to to movie but most of the laughs come from Wilson and Vaughn as their characters find themselves in one hilarious situation after another. The pacing was a little slow at times but the rest of the film made up for it's few flaws. I was very impressed with Wedding Crashers because it's one of the best comedies I've seen in quite sometime. My parents even liked it which really surprised me. Overall Wedding Crashers has plenty of humor and exceptional performances by the cast (Wilson and especially Vaughn) making this comedy worth seeing because is sure to please almost any fan of the genre.",2009
8,"I'm not a guy who usually goes for the gay and sexual humor. This is not because I am a prude, but because these kinds of movies tend to take it too far and just isn't funny after that point. Wedding Crashers, however, executed this brand of humor perfectly. Another plus that makes this movie an above average comedy is the fact that the comedy did not take away from the plot. Many movies, such as Animal House, go so out of their way to be funny that they forget that movies are meant to tell a story. Wedding Crashers did a great job of keeping the comedy in the realm of a specific plot. Wedding Crashers is a unique and fun movie and I would definitely recommend watching it.",2008

It is truly one of the best big box office movies that is actually funny. Clever humour, good morals (eventually), and plenty cheesy one liners that makes it a one of a kind amongst the many hundreds of slapstick US movies.

The acting is poor and the script worse, making the cinema seat harder as each long minute goes by. Of course the audience lapped it all up, guffawing at each sophomoric gag. How depressing to see that this awful movie is #1 at the box office. Good cinematography doesn't rescue it. We squirm seeing Christopher Walken and Jane Seymour repeatedly embarrassing themselves. We yawn at Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson lurching from unbelievable ""I love ya Buddy"" male bonding to predatory joint hunting of generic society chicks. Compared with the finer acting and script of now-running ""Must Love Dogs"", the winner of the toilet humor, bad language, degrade women and insult gays genre is undoubtedly ""Wedding Crashers"".

2,"Why do so many people love this movie? I just didn't buy it. The characters were undeveloped and the story predictable. I chuckled maybe once or twice during the entire movie, but in actuality, I was bored. To begin with, I found Will Ferrell's character disgusting and disturbing. To play on the idea of picking up women at funerals is in incredibly poor taste--even for comedy. Not to mention the relationship with Vince Vaughn's character and the psychotic girl was simply unrealistic. Owen Wilson's character finds love, so, in turn, Vince Vaughn's character, a man who thrives on being a playboy, who spent the latter part of the film hiding from the crazy girl, suddenly finds himself in love with her? Let alone the campy ending, which really seemed like the writers didn't know what to do, so they threw everyone together for a happy dysfunctional ending. This movie was supposed to be a situation comedy and I just didn't buy the situation, nor did I find the comedy really all that funny. It would make sense to be that senseless if the movie was intended to be ""stupid"" humor, but this movie was not promoted in that way. And as a result the ""jokes"" were poor attempts at raunchy humor and not really all that original.",2006

The further the movie goes the funnier it gets. And it honestly looks like something we all can do and have a blast doing it.

You either like Owen Wilson or you don't. I think this was the movie that really made me like him. As for Vince Vaughn, I thought he was terrific. He is a really good actor (sorry not to put it in a more philosophical vein) and he really got to me. You could really see how well he was acting. I found the whole plot very funny, and I think you have to see it twice (which I have) to really appreciate it. What can I say? I really enjoyed it.

They really are the perfect comedic duo. Wilson's confidence and heart of gold combined with Vaughn's supremely charismatic hate of the world. All of the performances in the film are golden. Rachel McAdams is so sweet and adorable that you feel like she's the girl next door that you've been in love with your entire life. Christopher Walken is an actor with such warmth and charisma that it's impossible not to love him. The real highlight of the film though is Isla Fisher. She is so natural and convincing in one of the most difficult roles of all time, that is scares the hell out of me. I'm scared to ever meet her because of how convincing she was. Will Ferrell delivered arguably the greatest cameo of all time. Even Bradley Cooper was brilliant as the chauvinistic, over the top jackass who is stealing the adorable, perfect girl. I really love everything about this film. I die in laughter from start to finish every time I see it. It's so quotable as well. My only real complaint is that it's pretty one-dimensional but that can be forgotten with how perfect of a comedy it is. Vince Vaughn is really a comic genius. His style of striking, smooth quick-paced, charismatic cynicism is more brilliant than any comedic style I've ever seen. He really is nothing short of a miracle to comedy.",2007

It's also the most riveting of the series; A movie of such visual and storytelling intensity that it makes our typical standards for summer entertainment seem trivial. Sith has wall-to-wall action and jaw-dropping special effects, yes. By all measures, Episode III is a grand success when it comes to giving the legions of Star Wars fans any and everything they could have hoped for after Darth Vader uttered the words ""We meet again"" in 1977. The beauty of Revenge of the Sith is that it earns much more than diverting summer thrills. Strip away all the baggage that comes with the name 'Star Wars' and what you are left with is the most enthralling film of 2005.",2015
9,"When I asked the reviewer sitting next to me to sum up Revenge of the Sith, he simply said ""great!"" That seemed to basically be the consensus of virtually everyone in attendance at an advance press screening of the final chapter in the Star Wars saga.",2005
9,"For several years now, it's been a rather uneasy proposition to be known as a STAR WARS fan. First, we had to put up with the great embarrassment of the clownish Jar Jar and the gut wrenching ""acting"" from the muppet known as Jake Lloyd in PHANTOM MENACE. Then came the laughably stilted dialog and the clumsily told love story from ATTACK OF THE CLONES. Fans far and wide were wondering what George Lucas had done to their beloved STAR WARS franchise! Something that once was so rollicking and without peer was being transformed into kiddie-pandering, muppet populated, CGI over-loaded dreck!",2005
10,"The last of the star wars films to be made and done in spectacular style. The only thing with this film is that it relies too much on digital technology, which causes it to lose some of the charm of the original trilogy.",2006
9,"(No Spoilers!) Excitedly submitting my comments two weeks prior to the opening of the film (after a preview screening at the Ziegfeld Theater), I am thrilled to add to what appears to be a growing wave of positive reaction to Lucas's effort in Episode III. As a life-long fan deeply caught in a love hate relationship with Episodes I and II, I cautiously awaited this final installment. I felt in my heart that this would be a great film, but feared that somehow I would again be disappointed. Maybe I was starting to succumb to the notion that I no longer had the spirit of that six year old boy who was mesmerized by the original Star Wars, long ago in 1977 at that far away NJ theater. Maybe.",2005

10,"Finally we have the episode3 of Star wars. So many things happens in this episode, that I need to make a summary of the things that happens. First of all, some years have passed since the Clone War. Anakin and Obi Wan are fighting as hard as they can, specially now that Palpatine was kidnapped by general Grievous, the leader of the droids army. Anakin finally menage to kill Count Dookan,( with Palpatine motivating him)and Obi Wan killed Gen. Grievous.",2006
10,"I personally am more of a fan of the original trilogy than what I have been of the prequels. Although I did enjoy TPM, and AOTC, they definitely were not as well done as A New Hope or Empire. I think the general criticisms of the first two prequels was lack of good story, and poor acting. First I would like to say that the acting is much better in Revenge of the Sith than the first two prequels, but what truly stood out in this movie was the story. It was delivered perfectly, for the first time since Empire, Lucas connected emotionally with his audience. The last hour of the movie was especially powerful. Although probably not planned, I think this movie will be the bridge that brings the old star wars sheep back into the fold. Just as Anakin eventually brings balance to the force, Revenge of the Sith will bring balance back to the Star Wars Universe. And judging by the reaction of the test audience I was part of, everyone I was with feels the same way, no one left their seat for at least a couple minutes after the movie ended.",2005
5,***Spoilers!****,2005
3,Let me start by saying quickly that I am a huge Star Wars fan like many others however I have no problem admitting Ep. 1 & 2 were mediocre films. I thought to myself that if RotS lived up to the story and to the hype that it would be all better. It turns out the effect was the exact opposite. After this installment I will probably never watch the prequels again with their lack of plot progression and clunky conclusion. ,2005
8,i loved star wars as a kid. i grew disenchanted with the new trilogy. i was prepared for another letdown.,2005
10,"In Coruscant, the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) rescue the Supreme Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) from the Separatist General Grievous' spaceship and Anakin kills Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) with his light-saber after a fight; however Grievous escape from the Jedi. When they land on Coruscant, Padmé Amidala (Natalie Portman) comes to tell Anakin that she is pregnant. Soon he has premonitions of his wife dying during the delivery. Palpatine requests that Anakin joins the Jedi Council against the will of the members but his is not promoted to Master and stays Padawan; further they ask him to spy Palpaline. Anakin is manipulated by Palpatine about the true intentions of the Jedi and is tempted to know the dark side of the Force that could be capable to save Padmé. Further Palpatine discloses that he is Sith Lord Darth Sidious. What will Anakin do?",2015
10,"To all the fans out there, it is time to rejoice. George Lucas has delivered in Revenge of the Sith. In my list of favourite Star Wars movie, it ranks up there with Empire Strikes Back in its emotional level, and action sequences.",2005
3,"Despite almost 30 years of warm up, Lucas still didn't come up with a  strong enough character motivation to explain Anakin becoming Darth  Vader.  Now when I watch the original do I have to imagine a sniveling, pouty  little punk in the suit? Lucas gave James Earl Jones some of his  trademark magic dialogue for his return: ""Nooooooo!"". Thanks, George.  I love how they have C3PO's memory wiped at the end, as if that closes  the plot hole. R2 would have been able to remind him. They should have  mentioned disabling R2's ability to fly and somersault out of planes  too.  Yes, this is the best of the new 3. It couldn't be worse than the  first, which only avoids the title of ""Worst Film of All Time"" because  it wasn't shot on film.  The political parallels are the best thing the film has going for it.  However, I would like to remind everyone that ""If you're not with me  you're my enemy,"" has been said for a MILLION years! If you want a real  laugh try attributing anything to W and convincing them it is a quote  he came up with other than his malapropisms.  The flipping Yoda is stupid. I know some geek somewhere thought it  would be really coolbut it isn't.  Ian McDiarmid gives a pretty good performance, but the silly faces he  makes while shocking people remind one why he is otherwise noticeably  absent from the annals of film history.  Keisha Castle-Hughes with the tiny part is pretty funny. The best  actress nominee walking behind the casket of the best supporting  actress nominee.  Ummmwhy did Padme die? She was ""giving up""? When she had two new kids  to look out for? Maybe if they had her give birth, have the kids hide,  go to try to win Anakin back and he kills her the movie might have  actually worked.  Sorry, Fanboys, I know you are all ready to dive back into the pool,  but this was still stale, unengaging and trite. I wish Lucas had never  made these three. There isn't a single moment in the entire new trilogy  that conveys the thrills of the trash compactor scene in the first  trilogy, or the fight on Hoth orwell, anything, even anything from  THX-1138. It's junk. If you'd held out after Episode 1 and demanded  better you might have got better, maybe he would have given up  directing like he did after Episode 4, but you didn't and they're crap.  If this is your idea of good then you deserve Jar Jar and what the  movie studios give you.  Sorry if this isn't a funny arch review but I found how terrible these  movies are, along with Lucas's systematic violation of our memories  with the pathetic changes he made to the original to be seriously  depressing. The man has no judgment. Why would Anakin at the end of  ""Jedi"" reappear as Haydn Christensen? He would appear as the redeemed  old shell he was when he died, like he did originally. Any fool could  see that except the fool with the control. Lucas makes studio control  look good.  A friend said this and I agree: what do I feel about this film? Relief  that it is all over.",2005
10,"By giving this film a perfect score, I am in no way suggesting that it is free of flaws, but ambition makes up for imperfection, and, with this movie, George Lucas has set out to film a Greek tragedy on the largest scale ever attempted. ",2005
9,"I was never one of the millions of Star Wars groupies. I enjoyed the films, except for Attack Of The Clones, but wasn't a huge fan. Having seen the first five, I eventually got around to checking out this last one, if for no other reason than curiosity. Wow, it changed my whole outlook.",2006
1,...like Frank Miller did for Batman.,2005
1,"This film was awful - as bad as The Phantom Menace, but without anything as good as the Darth Maul light sabre fight. I was checking my watch throughout the film, waiting for it to be over.",2005
2,"Why do so many IMDb members rate this movie highly? ""The actors really pulled it off,"" they say. Are you kidding, a third-grader couldn't be fooled by that acting. In fact, it wasn't even acting. It was the sound of thespians being tortured. ""The plot-line was gripping,"" they say. Gripping?! This must be the MTV generation talking: ""Give me flashes of light, give me staccato scene changes, give me words dropped like concrete balloons from another dimension, and I'm totally gripped.""",2005
1,"The main problem that this movie has is that it just goes too fast. This is because Lucas left a LOT of loose ends for this third movie, which results in an incredible effort to explain all of them in only one movie. The best example of this is that in this movie characters die all too often, such as Count Dooku (like in the first ten minutes), General Grievous (who was publicized too much but ended up being just a secondary character), and Mace Windu. Another example would be the Jedi; we get to see just a few deaths, and have to interpret those few killings as the extermination of most of the Jedi all over the galaxy. And even as they tried to pack this one full, some topics were not completely resolved, like why some Jedi disappear when they die and others don't. Also, the Wookiee battle is too short. Compare it with the Ewok battle in Episode VI, which lasted like one third of the movie. It just seemed like an excuse to cash in on the reappearance of Chewbacca. The romantic dialogues between Anakin and Padmé, just as in Episode II, are boring as hell. Aside from that, I was left wondering how come in ""Return of the Jedi"" Leia says she remembers her real mother, when Padmé died just minutes (or less) after she was born. Another important goof in this movie, thanks to the horrible DVD release of the original Trilogy, is that Anakin never wore the Jedi robes he appears wearing as a ghost in the new end of Episode VI, unlike Obi-Wan and Yoda, who appear wearing the robes they had on when they died. I am also curious about why they didn't bring back David Prowse to play Darth Vader. In this Episode he looks smaller and thinner than he was in the original Trilogy. All in all, I am glad that the prequels are finally over, because I was getting tired of watching ""Star Wars"" go down the toilet.",2005
1,"I saw Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith once, and I will never see it again. This movie is utterly devoid of anything positive or enjoyable. The first half of the film is basically about Anakin being an idiot and messing everything up, and the second half consists of him on a killing rampage. Sure, I know that the story of Anakin's transformation into Darth Vader absolutely HAD to be told, but therein lies the problem. This movie (and the other two, for that matter) was created solely to explain what is present in Episodes IV, V, and VI. There is no point to the film other than explanation.",2005

Two Jedi, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, are sent out to rescue the Supreme Chancellor, and what unfolds is an epic space battle and a lightsaber duel with the Sith Lord and Seperatist leader Count Dooku. After a successful rescue, the two Jedi end up being separated. Obi-Wan is sent to find General Grievous, who escaped the epic space-battle. Anakin is left on Coruscant, capital of the republic, to spy on Chancellor Palpatine, whose actions in the Senate seem suspicious.

1,Little could Mark Hamil have known when he uttered these words in A New Hope that he was making a profound prediction of the future of the Star Wars movies. Did he also foresee the rise of an actor who would make him look like Laurence Olivier?,2005
1,"Truly, this movie should not have been made. I do not understand how George Lucas saw the final version of this and proceeded to release it. The script had so much cheesiness it was hard not to vomit while seeing it. Honestly, I have seen better scripts in the worst soap operas. I liked some of the original movies- they had this excuse of ""oh it's the 70s they didn't have better movies back then."" They were fresh. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS MOVIE. ",2005
2,"It is always sad to watch potential die. This film, this story had it  all. It could have been the greatest of them all. The heartbreaking  tragedy of the man who gave up his name Anakin Skywalker to become  Darth Vader. Instead we were given, crap. This is why: (contains  spoilers)  The first problem is that since the first two movies were boring and  nothing really happened, everything has to happen now. So we've got  approx. 4 hours of plot to be shown in 2 hours.   The space battle: Mr. Lucas does only care about one thing, his  need to show the world how great the guys in ILM are to create  special effects. So what we see is 5 or 10 minutes commercial. And let  us add some cheesy dialog for Ewan and Hayden so everybody will know  it's actually a movie. Because it's not exciting, it's not amazing,  it's impossible to get an overview what's going on, it's just light  flashing and speakers trying to make the loudest BOOM-sound.  ""Oops here comes Dooku that I for some reason didn't kill off in the  last flick. Well let him fight for three minutes, say some cheesy lines  and then die."" And Lucas or Hayden, you made me believe Anakin killing  Dooku would be the first step on his path towards the dark side. That  he would be torn apart by agony of his action and the inevitable  satisfaction of letting go of his hate. None of this happens. Anakin  says something like ""Oh perhaps I shouldn't have killed him lalalala,  well, well, nobody's perfect"". So Dooku is dead. But hold on we've got  another villain, General Grievous. Darth Maul was underused. It's even  worse with Grievous only he's not cool. The idea of the mix between  droid and alien is great, however nothing of this is revealed. Grievous  is just another stupid villain. And the actor that provided his voice  for him should seriously think about changing professional.  ""Sh*t, I've already spent like 20 minutes of the film; I really need to  make Anakin evil now."" So we see some more wannabe-sound-of-music love  scenes where poor, poor Natalie Portman yet again has to fight against  lines and dialog that is absolutely horrible. I pity her, she must  curse the day she signed on Star Wars. Not your fault Natalie, we know  the truth. Yes, Anakin has more nightmares and yes, it is shown in the  same bad way as the last time. And yes, the Jedi council that never  seem to do anything useful, just sit and watch and do nothing (no  wonder you all will die) appears in a few scenes.  ""Oh my, I need to make Palpatine subtly persuade Anakin of the pleasure  of the dark side. Should we say like 2 scenes are enough?"" Basically  it's just ""Anakin join the Dark Side!"" ""No."" ""Yes do it."" ""No."" ""Yes  come on now."" ""Okay."" No wonder you could not persuade Luke.  ""Aah I still have to kill Grievous. Well, well more time for my lovely  fellows of the ILM to show their skills."" Let me say that Grievous dies  easier than Maul did and have even less screen time. Rubbish  NOW COMES WHAT BUGGERS ME THE MOST Finally after about 2 minutes of  persuading Anakin, Palpatine reveals himself to be the Sith Lord.  Anakin's life is shattered, everything he believed was in fact a lie.  This is dramatic, this is the purest betrayal. How does he respond?  Something like ""Oh really, hmm, I suppose I'd better alert the council""  Either Hayden is the worst actor or Lucas the worst director. Poor  Sidious, I reckon he wanted a better reaction than that. And when  Anakin tells Windu about it, Windu who has dedicated his life to the  Republic and to destroy the Sith? ""Palpatine's a Sith Lord, damn, well,  well, I think we need to catch him, you reckon it can be done before  lunch break?"" Yoda was humiliated to a mere action figure in AOTC. Here  Palpatine gets the same punishment. The death of Windu is kind of cool  though (thanks Jackson for at least making Lucas fulfill our wishes  concerning that scenes)  Anakin helps Palpatine kill Windu. How does he react? ""What have I  done? I'll do anything you want (to Palpatine)"" Yes that really does  make sense. Anakin you may have a high level of midi-chlorians (yes  they are mentioned) but your IQ-level is about zero. ""I fight for peace  and justice and in order to achieve those I have to kill a bunch of  innocent children."" Are you playing stupid games with me or something  Lucas? Which person would think that way? It is not logical, it's  pathetic. Every single scene with Anakin is in some way illogical.  In the end we have the Fight. With mystical dialog and with a tense of  broken friendship and love? No we get ""fast-forward"" 10 minutes of a  blue blurring light. And yes cuts from when the emperor throws chairs  at Yoda. You read it right.  Poor Natalie is made to say her final cheesy lines and is then allowed  to die.   Darth Vader is awoken; he really doesn't seem to care about anything  save that he screams ""no"" that is a parody of the  screams-of-no's-movie-history.  The End  The dream is dead.  Lucas failed us fans, for him showing a 2½ hour commercial of how great  he can make special effects were more important than conveying a  powerful story.  On the night bus home a man clad in Jedi robes wept. We all felt like  it.  This movie could have been everything we could have asked for. In hands  of a better director, with corrections by a real writer, this could  have been a new TESB. Now we were watching a fallen hero. Not Anakin.  Lucas.",2005
10,"The audience at this afternoon's preview screening of The Lion, The Witch & The Wardrobe, at New York's AMC 25 theater in Times Square, broke out in spontaneous applause at least three or four times. It seems that director Andrew Adamson has brought a thaw to normally-jaded New Yorkers as well as to the 100-year winter of Narnia. The movie pulls the viewer into the story right from the opening scenes of war-ravaged England, where siblings Lucy, Susan, Peter and Edmund (wonderful performances by all) are sent from their homes to the relative safety of 'the professor's' country estate where, during a game of hide-and-go-seek, young Lucy hides in the wardrobe only to discover the passage to the land of Narnia. From this point, the multi-layered story of betrayal, courage, sacrifice, redemption and hope unfolds into a briskly paced 2 hour and ten minute adventure that leaves the viewer emotionally charged and thoroughly entertained.

10,"I saw this movie with very high hopes and they were met. The acting was excellent and the special effects set a new standard for Hollywood. This, in my mind is the best movie of the year and a best picture nominee for sure. I do not think that it will win the best picture Oscar though because it is only the first movie in a series of seven. Each book though, unlike the LOTR series, is a completely different story with many different characters. Overall, this movie is a must see and the next six will likely be the same. C.S.

I was never been into fantasy movies until Lord of the Rings came out, which I thought was great. This movie was also very very good. From the beginning of the movie, I felt swept away into the story. I am rarely excited about new movies, but I was about this one, and it totally exceeded my expectations. ",2005

I experienced the same overwhelming sense of awe watching both of these phenomenal pictures. The CG images are very good, though not quite as startlingly realistic as those in LOTR. I cannot find fault with the casting in any way.",2005
6,"I saw this with 6 eight year old boys, which may have influenced my opinions somewhat, but they were not gripped by this. Firstly though, there is a lot right with this movie. The special effects are stunning. How they got Susan and Lucy to walk through the forest with Aslan I will never know - the problem was I found myself trying to work that out, rather than gripped by the narrative. The kids are great. Georgie as Lucy is particularly good I think - very Lucyish and Skander manages to make Edmund less of a prig and more angry and at odds with the world. THere are epic scenes (the boys all said they liked the battle scene yet, and acted some of it out in the pizza restaurant afterwards), and swooping vistas and vast tracking shots and rousing music. Its just that I had never really thought of Narnia like that. In becoming epic, they have lost two things - the magic and the playfulness. Lets take the magic first. A tiny point, but the snow didn't sparkle. You know how snow glistens and glints ? Well not in this Narnia it didn't. It wasn't a magical place to wander into - it was all too big for a start - massive walls of rock and huge mountains. Not strange enough a landscape (and it looked VERY like some of the landscapes in Lord of the Rings) - not intimate enough. ",2005
10,"The Chrinicles of Narnia, the lion the witch and the wardrobe, is now my favorite movie! this movie was FANTASTIC! the actors are amazing and the movie is just so exactly like the book.

I wouldn't normally give any movie 10 stars, but i gave this one 10 stars out of 10. When i was watching the movie, and seeing all the sets and the props, i felt like i had already seen them before. Like they had taken them right out of my imagination when i was reading the book. I know not everyone will have this feeling, but i did, and it was magical. Even if you don't want to see this movie, go because it really is a spectacular and magical movie.",2005

The green-screen use is laughable: for example, when standing on a hilltop, next to an animal whose fur is blowing in the wind, we see a too-close shot of the children, whose improperly-lit hair is standing PERFECTLY still... on a hilltop. The CG backgrounds are not detailed and very plain (hill, trees, no movement).",2005

9,"There are some that will, upon seeing this film, say that it was akin to Andrew Lloyd Weber attempting to make a political statement: overly dramatic. These people would be well served to remember that the symbol of drama is a mask, which certainly begs one important question- Why, if you are so put off by an overtly dramatic motion picture, would you choose to see a movie that stars as the (anti)hero a man in a mask? I just saw this film at an advanced screening and I must say it is nothing short of uniquely brilliant. Entertaining from the start, V manages to combine a strong socio-political message in a compact and highly intense experience. Infused with issues and concepts that pervade in the global political climate of our times, this movie is endowed with a tremendous timely relevance that belies its trappings as a mere action adventure.",2006

If I say ""This is one of the Best films I have ever seen..."" One would think the immediate response would be, ""Then you must not have seen many films in your time, dear boy."" Butoh I have, and it has been far too long since there has been something up on that screen in the darkened theater that I enter to leave this boring, monotonous existence that had the capacity to inspire. To see the possibilities of what might be, what could never be, and what could happen if the leaders of the world keep things going in the directions that they are headed. V For Vendetta is just a film, yes? But it is also a wake up call of which there are not enough in this time we live in. It speaks directly to the hardship that we endure but seldom take notice of because we are distracted by things that do not matter...upon leaving the theater I saw people, teenagers mostly, the very people who should be pro-actively questioning the methodical erosion of this thing called government in the modern age, react with complete apathy. Most try so hard to be so outwardly different from the rest that they do not realize that in doing this they become just like everyone else; oblivious. We as a society do not want to see films like this, we do not want to acknowledge the atrocities going on in the world, all we want to do is play our video games, watch reality television, spend our money on clothes, jewelry, entertainment. Things that for all intents and purposes we do not need. These are the distractions that keep society from pondering in the wee hours of the night what they can do to prevent true injustice. The evils committed by those that govern are far worse than any fiction the cinema can dazzle us with these days. Yes this is a truly great film and one that I will cherish for a long time. I can only hope that its message finds a wide audience that is open to seeing things from another perspective, in a uniquely human light. In the end that is what the film is about...being human. Having the capacity to choose weather or not to recognize the evils of society and take a stand to make things better than they are. The film of course takes this idea to extremes but for the viewing public dramatic examples are needed to awake them from this artificially induced state of being we call existence and say, ""I see there is wrong, and it is my duty as a human being to do what I can to make it right."" To the makers of this unique and wonderful film, I salute you.",2006
10,"'V for Vendetta' will no doubt be remembered as being one of the most well-produced films of this decade for its powerful script, strong character depictions and the sheer excellence in terms of quality. Loosely based on the DC Comic, the film is set in a totalitarian Britain where the BNP-like government who run the country with an iron fist that they make Thatcher's Tories look positively warm and trustworthy. Then emerges a vigilante in the form of V, a man deformed by fire and the governmental experiments that have given him enhanced strength, who is determined to free the UK from dictatorship by blowing up the Houses of Parliament. Evey is the young woman who is unwittingly embroiled in his plot and soon understands what just it is that motivates V so.",2006

But was i in for a BIG treat, this movie is so superbly acted by all  the actors, especially Natalie Portman performed according to me to an  Oscar nomination next year.  The movie is perfectly put together, so if you haven't read the comics  you will be on the edge of you seat the whole movie. Its really that  good folks.

I didn't see it at release, because I was far under the age demographic at that time, but I managed to catch up to the film at around 2011-2012. Not sure the exact year, but I was a teenager at the time, and I loved the Matrix (still do), and heard that V for Vendetta was written by the Wachowskis, so I thought I'd give it a shot.",2016

It's very inspiring, believe it or not and it didn't make me want to blow up buildings either. It just made me appreciate freedom even more.

8,"Remember remember the fifth of November When I first watched V for Vendetta I didn't know much about it. However I have always had a fascination with darker comic book movies such as The Crow and some of the Batman's. I am going start by saying that the character of V played brilliantly by Hugo Weaving is one of those characters that will be remembered and is an instance classic. This in truth is 1 of my favourite Natalie Portman performances, she is just so full of determination and curiosity and it's infectious. The scene where V and Evey first meat is truly tremendous. V saves Evey from some men trying to rough her up, she does hold her ground, V shows off some kick ass moves and a very versatile vocabulary (see what I did there). One of favourite things about V is he is an antihero yet he still views himself as a sort of freedom fighter who is standing up for the opposing government. The reason why I love this movie so much is the true determination to do what is right and the casualties that had to happen. V was a broken body but a free soul that wanted to make a difference and he did so. Was everything planned, I don't know but all I know is this movie is a must watch and truly is amazing",2016
10,"It's the late 2020s and London is ruled by a fascist government. A vigilante known only as V is trying to stop the government from ripping people's freedoms away by using a danger plan involving terrorist attacks and well timed murders. The movie follows Evey, a young woman who plays the key role to V's plan without even knowing. The movie starts with V, the vigilante, jumping down from the rooftops and saving Evey from a group of England's oppressive law enforcement. Afterwards, he inquires that Every come with him to see something he had set up. She reluctantly follows to see that he has blown up a government building and hacked into all of the speakers around the city which he had made to be shouting classical music as the building exploded into the night sky, fireworks streaking through the air. As the movie goes, gets into trouble as he sends a message to the whole town over a government frequency about how they have been censoring everything and stands for and stifling the whole city to ensure their rule. He also comments that in one year of the explosion he will act again, but even bigger and more destructive. The rest of the film follows Evey as she tries to survive on the run as the year passes. This movie focuses a lot around the idea of rights and how the government can control its people. Throughout the movie we see the government use censorship to control how the people act and feel. During V's first terrorist attack he plays classical music. The government bans this music from being played to do this to try and make people forget the event. Another instance in the movie where censorship came into play was near the end when they banned any clothes that looked like V's clothes to try and deter people from helping him or following in his footsteps. This movie is great representation of why civil rights are so important and is in general a really great movie.",2016

How can there be something so perfect in such an imperfect world?"". The shock remains until today, because the story went on to take the edges of me, of what I am, the ideas that this film conveys, freedom, truth, revenge, things of life itself. But the times, the effects, the views, it's poesy, it is theater, spooky, shocking. Until today, this is the best movie I have ever seen.

10,"I don't know why! Well, I've finally managed to see Brokeback Montain this week and I couldn't sleep all night. I've had to watch it twice more and I feel like watching it every day. I had never read any comments here about this movie, so I can say I wasn't influenced by anybody  I actually didn't know what to expect. What can I say? It's amazing how my feelings are similar to those of most people here  I just can't get this story out of my head! I was probably a bit skeptical about the effectiveness of this film and its importance in the history of gay-themed pictures, but I've changed my mind completely. Now I do think it's probably one of the most interesting, fascinating and realistic stories about homosexual love ever told on screen. Ang Lee doesn't judge anyone in the story (and every character can be blamed or understood for something) and homosexuality is portrayed in one of its basic aspects: to feel love and desire for someone who is of the same sex. But I also agree with those who think it's not only about homosexuality. Actually this story involves many universal themes: love  of course, but also loneliness, failures, the crosses we have to bear in life, poverty. I feel like crying every time I think about Brokeback Mountain and, adding the great cinematography and the stunning acting from all the main players, I can definitely say it's one of my favorite movies  forever! I've always been melted by love stories (I should mention George Cukor's 'Camille' and Edmund Goulding's 'The Old Maid' among my favorite pictures) but no movie has ever exercised such a lasting impact on me, and I really feel changed after watching it (you know, I'm gay, so it's not about having prejudices against homosexual love). Here are some of my favorite scenes: -the violence and tenderness between Ennis and Jack when they have a fight just before leaving Brokeback Mountain for the first time; -their first kiss after four years  the most moving screen kiss I've ever seen; -their last quarrel, Ennis crying and recognizing the failures of his life but, most of all, the flashback showing Ennis hugging Jack and singing a sort of lullaby and Jack's face while he looks Ennis leaving with his horse  it broke my heart! -from this moment on, everything  Ennis's phone call to Jack's wife, visiting Jack's parents, until his last close up and his tearful promise to his lover.

10,"Ang Lee's devastatingly beautiful ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a magnificent achievement. Early in production, the film was dubbed ""the gay cowboy movie.""

I'm female, middle-aged, hetero, and I defy you to tell me that the average straight guy is any more expressive than Ennis or any less needy than Jack. Or the average gal, either, straight or gay. Deeper than their sex, their sexuality, their religious, educational, economic or historic backgrounds, Jack and Ennis are two human beings living in the world as they find it--beautiful and indifferent at best, and as they find themselves--beautiful and flawed at best. Desire is desire. The desire for warmth, for connection, for any echo at all in the vastness of time and space, is shared by every human being ever to have lived. For me, the issue is not how repressed or thwarted Ennis and Jack are, but how persistently they turn toward the light, despite all impediment. Brokeback Mountain lyrically retells a story thousands of years old: loss and grief are unavoidable; love is where you find it.",2006

And when you don't, you very well could end up with nothing just as Ennis DelMar does. This is not a gay cowboy movie. It is an honest look at love and how two people who have the world against them try to follow their hearts but succumb to the pressures of a society that doesn't understand that love must transcend all.",2006

I'm the first to admit that I cry easily watching movies, but BBM left me beyond tears. This isn't a ""gay"" film, it's a story of the love that all of us dream about, yet few of us will ever find. So amongst the pain that Ennis was left with (that I too felt), I was hit with raw envy. Such is the power of love, regardless of gender. Heath Ledger's portrayal of Ennis completely took my breath away; I had seen him in several other movies, but not once did he leave such an impression. He went past acting, and actually became Ennis. Jake's part was no less amazing, and, in some ways, I believe he had the harder role. But, like Heath, he carried it off beautifully.

I sobbed for about an hour and could not get to sleep that night. There is no way I will look at pure, perfect love ever again.

Well, now, after seeing the film, I feel like writing a love letter myself. The film took over my senses and transported me. The tragedy that envelopes the lives of Ennis and Jack is caused by an ancestral ignorance that is part of our DNA and if you don't believe me read some of the hateful comments posted here alongside the love letters. That's the heart of the matter. After the summer in Brokeback Mountain, Ennis and Jack go their separate ways and Ennis hits a wall with his fists crying, trying to destroy his longing, self loathing, guilt, horror. Imagine in a world without ignorance and therefore without hatred, Ennis and Jack could have celebrated their love and attempt an honest life together. Imagine also if things were the other way and heterosexuals were the dark minority, imagine falling in love with a girl and having to keep it secret, never been able to tell or to show publicly your love for her. Men like Ennis, and there are many, have to curve their own emotions and conform, entering and developing unhappy marriages and why? Read some of the comments here and you'll understand why.

Why shouldn't I expect such a high calibre film in the first place? King Kong stumbles at many points before it falls completely head over arse. Given the sheer weight of Kong himself, you can see the comedy value of this, but I don't give films credit for being unintentionally humorous.",2006
1,"Back this past summer, I saw a trailer during War of the Worlds for the new King Kong movie. At the time I had only heard about who was in it, directing, etc. I had to say this trailer blew me away. Peter Jackson was able to make me a LOTR fan just from the movies alone, it wasn't till after the first LOTR that I read the books. So I figure, King Kong will be amazing. I loved LOTR, I felt that Jackson does an amazing job with CGI, and as unrelated as it may seem I am a huge Jack Black fan and was dying to see his first dramatic role in a blockbuster film. So Summer passes, as does Fall, and Winter rolls around. Soon enough its mid Decemeber and my friends and I are all amped, to say the least, to see what we honestly expect to be one of the best movies of all time, and a true experience. (Note the movie had been out for a week by this time, so any bad reviews we may have heard by that point.) So I enter my set with the most positive outlook on this movie and it goes all downhill from there. For the first portion of the film, NY to Skull Island. Every shot that involves a character speaking or listening to someone else speak is a tight and long close up. When this happens in a film, it is just plain insulting to intelligence. Only four year old need to be shown nice a big exactly who is talking. The characters seemed predictable, but then again there were few variations in which they could have been played. Although it may sound biased the best dialog acting was done by Jack Black, but maybe this was because he had almost the majority of the lines in the film, regardless of screen time (I mean come on, Watts can't talk to an ape for 90 minutes). Skull island looked pretty, and the most tense and ""into"" the movie I felt for the entire 3 hours was during the foggy night when they reached the island. About 90% of the movies I see in theaters entice my senses and grab my attention, keep me interested in the characters in other words, for the vast majority of the film. Even with the most positive state of mind on this film it failed to make me connect with it. Every shot of a native on skull island was horrid. Grosteque close ups with a blurry shaky camera left me shaking my head in shame in the seats. But then Kong shows up. Oh boy! I think, now this movie will get going. Again I am wrong. The best thing about Kong in the entire film was its realness in comparison to actual gorillas. Not at one point in this film did I feel sorry for Kong when he died, or saw any chemistry between Watts and Kong. By the time they leave the island, Jackson's shot have become tiresome clichés that he overuses again and again. I wasn't really expecting him to use the heroes crossing the bridge in single file shot like i saw so many times in LOTR, but he does it twice in the film. The Kong vs Rex scene was nice. But 4 minutes of action won't save the film. The bug fight was disgusting, revolting, unbelievable, and simply boring. I think my favorite part of the film was when they skipped the ride home on the boat. I actually half expected another 25 minutes or so and was actually relieved to see that part skipped. So what happens next? Well the part of Kong that everybody already knows from the first, ape gets lose, tears up NYC, finds girl, climbs tower, gets shot, famous last lines. I had heard that the original actress from the 33 film was to do the last lines, but she passed away before it could be filmed. I laughed for a bit when I saw Black deliver the famous last lines. In short, me and everyone I know found this movie completely overrated. Granted we had high hopes, but reading the online reviews and hearing the comments people made in the first week really was misleading. I sometimes wonder if they all just said they liked it so they seemed cool or something.",2006

Firstly, king kong could never fight off a t-rex let alone three. Another way to look at it is that a normal gorilla wouldn't be able to kill three raptors.

How can a top class production company oversee such vital elements of a movie, this i will never understand. Another thing i cant understand is how many people rate this movie a good movie? Please can someone enlighten me. If this is what the masses enjoy then I tend to wander where people intelligence and cultural integrity has disappeared too. If anyone wants to challenge me on this crit you are more than welcome to, this is my opinion and i really would love to hear yours! Yours sincerely peuge",2006
1,"What do you get when a one hit wonder director decides to make a remake of a classic? This pile of rubbish! I was as excited to see this movie as most people, but after that brontosaurus stampede with the people fighting raptor-like creatures while weaving in and out of dozens of tree trunk sized legs, the movie was all downhill. The CGI on King Kong was very good, except when he was physically interacting with Ann Darrow. In fact, most CGI that had a human interacting with another creature was not very good, especially the brontosaurus stampede. NYC also looked very good. But just because it's pretty doesn't mean it makes up for the other terrible CGI.",2005
2,"I went to see this film because I wanted to go and see an amazing film. It is and for all the wrong reasons in my opinion. You can argue about the acting if you want - I thought it rather ordinary, but given that the actors had a limp script and a blank CGI background, I thought they did as well as they could.",2006
1,"For the record, I loved the Lord of the Rings Series. I love long, heavy movies. The length of most movies doesn't bother me - as long as it is worth it. And King Kong is not worth it.",2006
1,"Peter Jackson is,supposedly,a massive fan of the original,but you'd never guess it from this mess.Now it's obvious he wasn't going to remake it verbatim,but i didn't think he'd jettison everything that made the original 1933 version a masterpiece.To think that a film made 72 years ago blows this embarrassment away in every department,well,it's amazing.Many will rave about the effects being superior,but i don't think so.CGI is a nasty cop-out,and although the original is far from realistic,there is something better about it than this.Everything is ridiculously overblown that it becomes an incoherent mess,and in my opinion the motions created with CGI are completely unconvincing.",2005
2,"To save your time: BORING BORING THE KING OF BORING! Now for the rant: BORING...except when those neat-o CGI-wrought effects sequences happened. But though they looked cool, they looked completely fake, which detracts.",2006
2,"When I saw the previews of the movie I thought the movie was going to be absolutely spectacular. I loved Lord of the Rings and I thought Jackson would do a good job with this one too. Boy, was I wrong. This movie is so overdone and stupid it is unbelievable. The beginning of the movie is VERY drawn out and includes characters that have no point in the film. Not only that, you get backstory on these characters. Usually when you build characters up, they have a purpose in the story. Sometimes Mr. Jackson, we want to know what happens to characters if you build them up. Then once they get on the island it is pure chaos. How anyone could plausibly survive that island is beyond me. The natives are gonna get ya. If the natives don't get ya, Kong's gonna get ya. If Kong doesn't get ya, the dinosaurs will get ya. If the dinosaurs don't get ya, the bugs are gonna get ya. If the bugs don't get ya, the bats are gonna get ya (if they don't decide to attack Kong first). My favorite scene in the movie is when Adrian Brody fights all of the above and then goes after Kong with no weapon. Hmmmmm...that's a good decision. I just nearly lost my life to natives, dinosaurs, and giant bugs, but I don't need a weapon for a giant angry gorilla. Right. At this point in the movie I was waiving a white flag in the theater. ""You got me Mr. Jackson. I give up! You can have my ten dollars! Just no more picture! No more picture! (sobbing). I haven't even mentioned the ridiculous love story between Naomi Watts and Kong. But if you enjoyed all that over-hyped overdone madness that you've seen up to that point, I'm sure you would enjoy that too. I recommend this movie to people that don't like plot or any sense of reality or reason in their films. The special effects are good, but what a waste! Peter Jackson, I beg you, PLEASE DO NOT REMAKE ANY MORE FILMS! In any case, I cant wait for the unrated version to come out on DVD.",2006

1,"the last movie I saw Adrian Brody and Thomas Kretschmann in was the Pianist and to think that King Kong and the Pianist come from the same planet let alone the same art form is incredible. King Kong is quite simply terrible on every level. After about 10 min in I hated it. The scenes in New York of all the people living in dire poverty on the streets (I was born in 1934 and never heard of women and children living this way altho there were hobo jungles) yet two years later a huge auditorium is filled with (supposedly) the same people dressed up in furs and tuxedos! Hated the fake, fake scenery of New York at that time. Why did Ann have a watery gruel for breakfast first day out on the ship but the whole huge crew evidently had enough food for this fantastic journey. Also in 1933 it could have been possible for people to believe there was an ""undiscovered"" island somewhere, but although this story is set then, the viewers are living in 2005/6 so why even try to remake it.",2006
1,"This movie was an awful letdown. It was terrible! I must say that the SFX were over-the-top. The animation itself was great, but the way they used it was just terrible. They made Kong roar about 50 million times for no apparent reason.",2006
5,"No problem agreeing with Universal's description that, ""Peter Jackson brings his sweeping cinematic vision to 'King Kong'. Naomi Watts, Jack Black, and Adrien Brody star in this spectacular film filled with heart-pounding action, terrifying creatures, and groundbreaking special effects unlike anything you've seen before! Get ready for breathtaking action in this thrilling epic adventure about a legendary gorilla captured on a treacherous island and brought to civilization, where he faces the ultimate fight for survival.""

1,"I watch 3 movies every week, 2 on DVD, 1 at the theatre. Over the years I've seen a lot of bad movies. Very bad movies. But Peter Jackson's King Kong was the first one I ever walked out of. I couldn't take any more after the first hour. As a matter of fact, I thought the first 20 minutes were pretty bad, but I kept saying ""it'll get better, it'll move along."" I waited and waited and waited, finally after an hour they got to the island, and it was still garbage. That was enough. Came home, threw in some laundry and wrote a letter to Peter Jackson's Production Company, enclosing my theatre ticket, demanding a refund. ",2006
1,"This has to be one of the most over-hyped movies of all time, a veritable 'King Kong' of a movie deflated to Bubbles the chimp stature with its wooden acting, naff sequences, contrived plot and extreme length.

1,"Where oh where did it all go wrong? You had a $200 million budget, special effects wizards up the wazoo and Peter ""LOTR"" Jackson directing a bona fide classic that could only benefit from a modern retelling. However, the end result -- a bloated, melodramatic, self-indulgent dog's breakfast of a movie -- proves the maxim that sometimes, ""less is more."" King Kong is a very simple story, in fact, its almost a parable or fable, and the drama and excitement is all in how you tell that story. The original Kong (1933), despite its dated effects, still remains a gripping, moving experience because of the way the story is told through the magic of the cinema. Peter Jackson obviously hasn't watched the original for some time because his version takes all the magic out and replaces it with boring special effects and long running sequences that badly need editing. Why Jackson decided to stretch this simple movie to over 3 hours is a question only he can answer.",2006

10,"With Hellboy, Guillermo Del Toro lovingly recreated panels from artist/creator Mike Mignola's comic book stories and brought them to vibrant life, setting a new benchmark for adaptations that respect their source material. With Sin City, however, co-directors Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller have done more than just recreate the brutal chiaroscuro of Miller's stark post-modern noir artwork, they've captured the essence and the aesthetic of Basin City (as much a character as Marv or Hartigan) and brought its universe and characters to a stunning three-dimensional life. And unlike Hellboy, which suffered from a weak, confusing script, Sin City weaves a Pulp Fiction-esque narrative which snakes through the dark streets and crooked alleyways of this hellish metropolis like a fever dream.",2005

10,"Channel surfing late one night I stumbled across this film and stopped to look because of the unusual cinematography. It's visually stunning, mostly in b&w and that evokes a film noir atmosphere punctuated with those brilliant flashes of color. Two minutes later I couldn't take my eyes away. This unique film is superbly executed, the casting, the screenplay, the special effects, everything about it. As we all know, there is an expansive library of film work out there for a wide range of tastes and sensibilities. If yours are delicate, if you are offended by gore and violence, then this film will NOT be your cup of tea. Stay away from it. But if both the horror and film noir genres appeal to you, you'll probably find this movie as captivating as I did.",2006
10,"I must admit that I know, or knew rather, very little about the story or history of Frank Miller and his series of comic book novels - and maybe that is why I enjoyed this movie so much. Although, this is still a different type of situation where one who was a big fan of the stories might be seriously critical of every little detail of the comic book turned movie. I don't believe anyone who considers themselves truly knowledgeable about Miller's work can say that this was not represented well on the big screen. I'm now intrigued to go back and check out some of his work.",2005
8,"Went to a sneak preview of this movie today, and I was blown away. Over the years people have tried to emulate the feel of comics on the screen, and met with mild success(Dick Tracy), minor failure(Hulk), and solid success(Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow). This is hard to do, but Sin City hits this dead on. The film is entirely in black and white(Except for about 20 seconds that I noticed in one scene.), except for highlights of color(Gorgeous eyes, splattered blood, and red Converse All-Stars to name a few.). This gives the film a feel that immerses you into the storyline. Add to this the overly corny duologue and scenes where scantily(And I DO mean scantily) clad women pull Uzi's out of literally nowhere, and you have all the right makings for a transfer of a comic book to the screen. The duologue had me laughing almost constantly, but it's easy to tell that they wanted you to laugh, even when they lines were incredibly corny and melodramatic...",2005
9,I'm only a marginal comics fan - I read a bunch of stuff over the course of a year or two in college and haven't read much at all since. Frank Miller was my favorite writer then and the I always loved the Sin City series. I didn't realize the movie was even being made until I saw the notice for the preview screening (if that's an indication of how much I follow comics these days).,2005
10,"Based on the graphic novels by Frank Miller (who also co-directed and wrote the screenplay) Sin City tells three stories of crime, corruption, and redemption set in the fictional town 'Basin City'. The first story details the quest of Marv (Mickey Rourke) who searches town for the man who murdered Goldie (Jamie King), the woman he believes to be his one true love. The second tells of Dwight (Clive Owen) who must cover up the death of a corrupt police officer (Benicio Del Toro) in order to avoid a war between the cops, and the girls of old town, led by Gail. (Rosiaro Dawson) The final story shows Hartigan, (Bruce Willis) a beat up retired cop framed for a crime he didn't commit, trying to save the life of a girl whose life he saved at a young age, who grew up to become a stripper, (Jessica Alba) while all the while being tracked by a mysterious stranger with a grotesque appearance. (Nick Stahl)",2005
8,"I just came back from an advance screening of Sin City, and I can tell you this is one salient reel of pitch of a film. Think of it as film noir amped up for a post modern century. It comes across like most of Frank Miller's writing, modestly fantastic for the comic environment, but steeped long and hard in the tradition of the underground crime writers of the '40's. Visually, the juxtaposition of the rich B&W with digitally-hued Technicolor makes it hard to take your eyes off the screen. This film was tailor made for most of the people who have been following Miller's writing for the past twenty odd years, brimming with many of his trademark elements and visual style that he, along with Messrs. Rodriguez and Tarantino, capture brilliantly. Not for more sensitive or under aged souls, Sin City will burn like a fire that you have to watch for everyone else.",2005
7,"I'll put my bottom line at the top so you can decide whether to read on. I can't recommend this film to the average cinema-goer.

Others should read on and decide if this is something they want to see. ",2005
1,"This is a perfect adaptation of several of Frank Miller's Sin City stories.

I'm sure the internet film geeks have already erected a shrine to this film. But unlike them, I have not come to praise Miller (or really Rodriguez), but to bury him.",2005
10,"The movie is really great. Especially the thing about colors. The movie is black and white but somethings like the red dress, blue eyes of Alexis Bledel are colored, which i find very original. Also i realized that on the dancing scene in which Jessica Alba and Bruce Wills meet at the bar, the whole movie becomes colored. Even the least important roles are taken by very famous actors and actresses and the acting is very solid throughout the movie. When you combine all these with frank miller's excellent scenario, one of the best movies ever is the result. I think that this movie deserves a higher rank in the top250 movies list.",2009

1,"To speak against violence in film is bound to earn me the status 'unenlightened' or 'moralistic'. Nonetheless, it is not violence that is the target of my criticism, but rather the glorification of violence for its own sake. For example, the violence in Fight Club, while sometimes intense, is explored as a means of finding release. The gore in Luc Besson's The Messenger is actually discussed in the film, critiqued as part of the brutality of war.",2005

1,"First of its important to say that I am a Roald Dahl fan, and indeed a fan of the original 1971 film Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory. What that film and the work of Roald Dahl have in common is charm, warmth, eccentricity etc. This Tim Burton film does not share in any of it. Having sat and forced myself to watch the entire film hoping something good would happen I was left feeling nothing but empty. I enjoyed most of Tim Burton's work and was rather excited about this film when it was announced, the trailers never gave away too much and I kept on hoping right up until the credits rolled. So whats so bad about it then? My first massive problem with the film is the reactions from the children through the film. Were they sedated during filming? Watch the scene where they tear down the chocolate river in the boiled sweet boat, does one of them even scream in delight? are they not amazed they are on a boat made from candy on a river of flowing chocolate? Most of the time they stand there looking like they would rather be somewhere else, how are we supposed to believe in the wonder of this amazing factory if the kids there aren't even impressed (too much blue screen work perhaps, means the poor actors had nothing to be amazed at) ",2006
1,"This movie was simply awful. I am waiting for someone, anyone, to point out that Johnny Depp was just terrible. The first twenty minutes, in a grandiose fashion, leads us to a giant man named Willy Wonka who can put the world on it's toes by putting gold tickets inside five candy bars. Then when you meet Wonka, he's nothing. Johnny Depp is as pale as a sheet; I'm not referring to his white makeup and fake white teeth, but his acting. He's doing an imitation of Jim Carrey doing an imitation of Michael Jackson. His Wonka not believable at all. The kids are just bad. Rich, and bad. You get the whole Hollywood push of ""rich kids are evil, while poor kids are perfect"", meanwhile, what about the children of Hollywood actors and producers and directors, are they exempt because their parents are artists instead of capitalists? I don't get it. I just don't get it. I really don't get this at all. This movie was so terrible. The songs were horrid. One Oompa Loompa playing them all of them was cheap and lame; and the songs made me hide my head in disgust. And there is a segment where Burton pays ""tribute"" to Stanley Kubrick's ""2001"", and it's all but blasphemous to people like me who literally worship classic films. In the original, Gene Wilder was believable. He really seemed like the character. He was the character. But Depp, as usual, was simply performing. Horrible. Horrible. One of the worst movies I have ever seen. A C.G.I. overkill.",2007
7,"Yesterday I had the pleasure of watching ""Charlie & the Chocolate Factory"" at the Wilkinson American Movie Day. And, oh boy, I was in delight! Don't expect a bleak remake of the amusing (and rather psychedelic) 1971-version. It is in every way a genuine Tim Burton-movie, stacked with beautiful imagery, wacky humor and bizarre characters, but at the same time faithful enough to the spirit of the novel. Roald Dahl would've been proud. It also features outstanding performances by the entire cast. Johnny Depp gives us a strange, almost creepy Willy Wonka, Freddie Highmore is a perfect Charlie, the Grandparents are lovable and wacky, and the five other children and their parents are amusingly irritating. And last but not least, an excellent soundtrack by Mr. Danny Elfman, reminiscent of both Edward Scissorhands and his early Oingo Boingo-days. Go see this with your parents, children, grandparents, movie buff-friends, nephews and nieces ... they will be equally delighted!",2005
1,"This is a horrible horrible version of this movie. Where in the hell in the book does Wonka talk to his father. And the part where Wonka denies Charlie the factory because he wants to bring his family, absolutely ridiculous. Wonka is supposed to be an inspiration. Not a jerk who has a magical moment with his father. The characters are just completely screwed up. Why on earth would this remake even be considered good. My next problem Oompa Loompas. Where did this freakin idea come from. This movie may have been considered good only if you have never seen one: the original movie two: you have never read the book and three: you have never seen a johnny depp movie. All around a horrible movie. Never waste you time renting this.",2008

1,"This movie was simply awful. Willy Wonka lacked the warmth, humor and wit that was shown by Gene Wilder in the original. The use of one person as the Oompa loompas comes off as cheap production, whether it was or not. The changes made, even subtle ones such as the order or events between Charlie finding the money and getting the last ticket and the introduction of the elevator just seem off. One of the most memorable moments is left out, which is the fizzy drink that makes Charlie and Uncle Joe float around.",2005
1,"Tim Burton kept saying he wanted to make a version much more faithful to the source material, which leaves me wondering why he didn't. ",2005
3,"If the only justification for this being a great movie is that it is true to the book, then it shouldn't have been made at all. Tim Burton has successfully digitized and sterilized the Chocolate Factory universe, and in so doing has destroyed a wonderful piece of pop culture. No longer will orange-faced, green-haired Oompa Loompas populate my imagination (and nightmares). No longer will I wonder just what in the world an American boy was doing living in a ramshackle house in a nondescript Bavarian town. And no longer will I wonder what drove Gene Wilder's Wonka to be such a lovable sadist, or just exactly what drugs he popped before taking that insane boat ride. In short, the imagination of the original film is gone, replaced with a shallow, bloated, big-budget disappointment. ",2005
1,"I was actually excited to see this movie, I wasn't expecting anything, I was just intrigued to see another Tim Burton film. The pictures in the film and the factory were spectacular and mesmerizing. Without even paying attention to the story line it was clear this was a Tim Burton film, truly fantastic. But Like watching a model trying to ponder physics, the beauty is only skin deep. Where was the heart in this movie? The acting, the dialog, the people all fell short of human behavior. ",2005
2,"Just like so many other remakes of great films, this is one that fails miserably on so many levels. First of all, Johnny Depp does not display near the wit nor the charisma that Gene Wlider did in the original. You actually see Willy Wonka before the big day arrives, which takes some of the mystery out of the character.",2005
2,"This movie version stunk! Yes, I know it was more to the book but having Johnny Depp??? Come on. Don't get me wrong, I do like Johnny Depp. He's had his share of good and bad movies but this another bad one (I don't think he can get any worse than Cry-Baby). Anyways, I do believe they could have done better for the role of Willy Wonka! Much better. You can really tell this was a Tim Burton movie. The coloring, the acting, and the sets. How about that house?? Seemed like one small touch to it and it would just fall like a deck of cards. How can Charlie really sleep with the roof open like that? (Yea, I know, it is a fantasy book) The Oompa Loompa scenes were terrible! It was interesting that the same guy played ALL of the Oompa Loompas but the dance scenes were just plain awful. Just another part which downgraded this movie. But back to the fact that he played ALL of the Oompa Loompas, would it have hurt to get more than ONE person to play the parts??!? At least in the Mel Stuart version, they got a bunch of them to play the parts and some of them couldn't speak English! OK, time for the good parts. Tough to do. I would give this movie an 8 for the special effects. The glass elevator for instance. Traveling throughout the factory and even through the town with rockets. Nice. So having the choice of the Mel Stuart version, which got away from the book a lot but good actors, or this new Tim Burton, which stuck to the book but bad choice of actors, I would still pick the Mel Stuart version in a second!! Sorry Roald Dahl!!",2005
1,"I'm not sure if this is a SPOILER or not, but my opinion. I was really looking forward to seeing this. I like Johnny Depp and I loved the original. I was very disappointed in this for several reasons. 1) I thought it was going to be a Part II and not a remake. Why remake something that was already great? Why not make a movie as Charlie himself grown up and running the factory. 2) Depp is quirky in a freaky, irritating kind of way, often resembling Michael Jackson in a strange way. 3) They ruined all the great songs that were in the original, with completely new, completely irritating, please turn the *@#$ off, it's killing me, kind of songs. 4) Kudos to the one guy who played ALL the oompa loompas.... again pretty strange looking and very digitized.... i like the originals much better instead of exact clone of one. 5) They changed the idea of a lot of the scenes completely... no bad/golden egg for example, no everlasting gobstoppers. 6) My kids didn't like it much either and looked kind of disturbed after the show.",2005

6,"Director Tim Burton has come a long way since his first job as an animator for Disney in the early 1980's. He made several animated shorts, none of which were deemed suitable for children - an early indication of Burton's dark outlook. However, his hard work and talent did not go unnoticed. His subsequent directorial work on Beetlejuice (1988), Batman (1989) and Batman Returns (1992) cemented his role as an experimental and visionary director/producer. Nobody else, therefore, was surely more suitable to adapt Dahl's much-loved novel, and nobody else was surely daring enough to attempt a re-make of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971, directed by Mel Stuart), that enduring classic starring Gene Wilder as Wonka.",2007
1,"Ahem, where do I start? When seeing this movie the first thing that struck me was the ""exciting"" music at the beginning which reminded me a bit of Harry Potter. The opening scene was absolutely riveting, showing the wrapping of bars of chocolate. I almost fell off my sit because I was so intrigued. The beginning of the film surpassed itself in making us realize by about 2 minutes of it that it was going to be absolutely dreadful. The real fun began when we met Willy Wonka. I won't say who he reminded me of.. anyone who's seen the film would know and I don't want to spoil the pleasant surprise for those of you who haven't yet had the honour. The oompaloompa dances were possibly the worst things I have ever seen. Who choreographed them?! I want to meet this insane idiot! It literally made me want to puke. They had an eerie kind of synchronization which was so unnatural that it was scary. I admit to finding the first dance slightly amusing but by the time I'd got to the 4th I was just staring at the screen in disgust.",2005

He even matched the facial expressions to the drawings, especially in the case of Charlie's family. Charlie himself looks like one of the drawings, and the Bucket house is so much like the illustrations it caused me to realize that Burton is as visual as any movie director can be. (Recent editions feature the work of a different illustrator. I'm talking about the illustrations from the 1960s. The difference between the older illustrations and the newer ones is the older ones feature a lot of cross-hatching. I imagine the older illustrations are still available, especially in a hardcover, but you'll need to search the net.) I don't know how he did it, but he got the facial expressions of Charlie's family and of Mike Teavea's father down perfectly. He also absorbed Dahl's sense of humor. The opening fifteen minutes or so, in which the winners of the golden tickets are announced one by one, really get Roald Dahl's sense of the ridiculous. I think Burton's addition of Wonka's childhood story fits well, although I'll agree that the way this is resolved is not completely in Dahl's spirit. Even in the resolution, however, Burton maintains sly humor. It is well-acted by everybody. I'd like to say that Julia Winter, who plays Veruca Salt, has turned in a truly well-observed comedic performance. Depp converts the novel's jaunty, precise Wonka into a quirky one, but it works well, because, as in the novel, Wonka's endearing traits contrast with the fact that he's a tyrant. Roald Dahl gets a rap for his cynicism, and this movie softens his message a bit. Dahl is a bit like Orwell. Both of them point out that man, given power, will exploit his fellow human beings. CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY the movie is not quite as dark as the book. But it comes very, very close.",2005
1,My wife & I went to see this today (3rd August2005); we were really looking forward to it because of all the media hype and the trailer looking great.,2005
3,"They took most of the fun and wit out of this movie compared to the 1971 version with Gene Wilder. In this one, Willy Wonka is a depressing weird loser instead of a wise prankster. He had none of the charm or appeal of Gene Wilder's Willy. All the characters were better in the 1971 movie except maybe Violet who had a little more going on this time. However her transformation into a blueberry is overdone and just looks like the computer FX it is. The oompa-loompa's are without personality and their songs are mostly unintelligible. The choreography was okay, but I couldn't help thinking, ""Those CGI guys sure did a lot of work on that."" Stick with the '71 version. The songs alone make it far superior to this corporate computerized makeover. The 2005 version definitely won't be remembered in 30 years.",2005
4,"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is not another version of the 1971 movie. It has nothing to do with the former movie and is supposed to be adapted from Road Dahl's novel. However, the new movie takes a cute and imaginative children's book and begins to twist it into a weird, disturbing and slightly aggressive movie. If the movie had dove into the idea and had created a dark movie, I would have respected the 2005 movie much more. Yet, the movie was spineless, the center of a tug-of-war match between the dark-side and children's fantasy.",2005
1,"What. What the deuce. What the diddly deuce did I watch? Tim Burton--you're married to Helena Bonham Carter. You've made several Gothic-cutesy movies which, while decidedly not my style, are not bad. Why did you have to put your cold, spidery hands on my darling Charlie and the Chocolate Factory? WHY?? Charlie's not a bad actor. His parents, although rather predictably cast, are cute in that dingy-British-zany-Tim-Burton way. The humor at first is pretty funny. I'm not in love, but I'm not screaming in agony either.",2013

9,"A ""modernised"" version of Jane Austen's classic novel that should not be compared unfavourably with 1940 Hollywood Olivier / Garson version nor several BBC serials culminating in the most acclaimed TV series version from 1995 with Colin Firth & Jennifer Ehle-a personal favourite. ",2005
10,"Jane Austen's tale of love and economics reaches us once more with the energy of a thorough novelty. ""Pride and Prejudice"" has been a favorite novel of mine since I first read it and I've seen Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson, Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle and now Matthew MacFadyen and Kiera Knightly. Amazingly enough I've never been disappointed. The material seems to be full proof. Colin Firth's Darcy, in many ways, is the Darcy I've always imagined. He's been an actor I've followed feverishly since his glorious Adrian LeDuc in ""Apartment Zero"", Matthew MacFadyen was totally new to me but he managed to create that sense of longing that makes that final pay off so satisfying. Kiera Knightly is a ravishing revelation. I must confess, I didn't remotely imagined that she was capable of the powerful range she brilliantly shows here. The other big surprise is Joe Wright, the director, in his feature film debut which is more than promising, it's extraordinary. The photography, the art direction and the spectacular supporting cast, in particular Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn, makes this new version of a perennial classic a memorable evening at the movies",2005
1,"Judged as a movie in its own right, Joe Wright's Pride and Prejudice is a disappointment. Judged as an adaptation of a classic Jane Austen novel, however, it is nothing short of a travesty. For those of you already acquainted with the book, be warned; the only thing that Wright's work has in common with the Austen masterpiece is it's title. Even with the most superficial of viewings, it is clear that the script holds little more than a passing resemblance to the novel. Wright goes to great pains to include most of the story's key features, but has seemingly neither the time nor the inclination to go into any real manner of depth with them. Important plot points - such as Lydia's disappearance and subsequent elopement - are introduced and resolved so quickly that the viewer is denied the luxury of suspense. Consequently, the film feels remarkably lacking in drama, and a sense of flat detachment permeates into every aspect of the script.",2006
10,"Outstanding ... MacFadyen is a worthy Darcy and a darned good actor to boot! The scenery, backgrounds, and country folk were much more realistic than previous versions. The costumes and hairdos also seemed in keeping with the times. Another great addition is the priceless Donald Sutherland who, in a perfect world, would have had more scenes with Judy Densch. If those two can't chew up the scenery, nobody can. And, finally, Keira Knightly is a jewel. Her beauty is so apparent that it almost detracts from the fact that this is a very good actress who can hold her own in any room. This was a delight and I only wish that it could have been 6 hours long.",2005
1,"If you have never heard of Jane Austen, seen the original movie or the 1995 BBC adaptation, or even seen a pop up version of the book, then this farcical attempt to show this classic love story may be considered vaguely endurable.",2005
2,Well Wright may have made a gritty depiction of life around 1800 - as he so repeatedly and anally goes on about because of when it was written as opposed to published - but it is HIS not Austen's and shouldn't claim to be an adaptation.,2005
10,"While I will say first off, that no movie production ever made will ever equal a novel, especially one of this magnitude, this movie is very well done. I read many reviews going either way, but I must say I enjoyed the film very much. Many are quick to criticize Mac's performance saying he didn't do a good job. I thought he was fine, but believe me he is no Colin. Keira Knightley was absolutely incredible in the film, I would go as far to say it is her breakout performance. Donald Sutherland was amazing, but as can be expected from him. Judi, like always is incredible at her role as Lady Catherine.",2005
1,"For the sake of starting with something positive, let's throw out the very biggest problems like historical placement and accuracy. If we can get stupid enough to ignore a boat load of adaptation problems, we might at least admit that this movie was beautifully designed and very well shot. Watch this monstrosity with the sound off, and you'll enjoy some remarkable cinematography.",2005
1,"I went to see suspecting I would hate it, I did. Everything about it was wrong; it was like they were filming a different book. Granted the locations and houses very lovely (if not a little miscast-yes even the house were wrong for their parts) Keira was too modern, dull and frankly I found it unpleasant to watch her. Were everyone else sees Darcy as a sex god the writer of this saw him as sexually frustrated and inadequate. Bingley was stupid and dippy (he isn't meant to be) and the Bennett's were shown to be destitute and for some unknown reason farmers, this is incorrect and ludicrous. The very idea that Mr Bennett would answer the door in his night gear with the rest of the family dressed in their underwear to in the middle of the night is stupid. They had servants. Mr Collins was not repulsive and greasy merely stupid and obnoxious, Georgina Darcy was ugly and old and Miss Bingley wore a sleeveless dress, what! As if! It is Historically inaccurate and even the ending is unsatisfying. I could go on for days. I hated it so much as not only was it nothing like the book but I fear that for many people it will be their fist experience of this great novel and it will give them the worst possible idea of it. The BBC version is so superior it's not even funny and everything about this version is an insult to its memory. In short if you must see it be sure you have read the book first or seen the BBC version other wise you will be lead done the deluded road that this is what it's like, which its not!",2005
1,"The sparkling wit, the colourful detail, the absorbingly real characters and the familiar concerns of the inhabitants of Pride and Prejudice made the book and several movies into timeless classics. This new movie adaption highlights the brilliance of Austen and the excellence of a faithful reproduction.",2006
10,"The fantastic romantic world of Jane Austen again makes its way to the silver screen in Joe Wright's new adaptation of the classic novel Pride and Prejudice. It is the first feature film to be adapted from it in 65 years, and believe me when I say it does not disappoint. This adaptation is, for lack of a better word, a BRILLIANT achievement that keeps you actively involved from the first scene to the very last scene, just about consuming you with aching romance  and it is sprinkled with humour and intelligence.",2006
5,"Actually, I was highly disappointed in the movie. I admit having a strong bias towards Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth, and I actually said earlier that a new adaptation wasn't necessary as there is a perfectly functional BBC miniseries, but still I was disappointed. Don't get me wrong. I thought Keira Knightley made a very good Elizabeth. She has just the headstrong and witty nature a real Lizzy needs. But that was about the only redeeming quality of the movie I could find. Though, now I think of it, it is good that this one doesn't last six hours.",2005
7,"Having watched a slew of special effects-laden trailers before this film I was reassured to discover that in the brave new world of CGI cinema there is still a place for a satisfyingly romantic story, well-acted and thoughtfully scripted and directed. ",2005
1,"There are many, including prominent professional critics, who commend this adaptation of ""Pride and Prejudice"" for its ""realistic"" portrayal of dirt, unkempt clothes and hair, farm animals wallowing in the living room, etc. In fact, it is not only historically unauthentic, it is false to Jane Austen. There were no such scenes of squalor included in the novel. To the contrary, Austen wrote a passage in which Elizabeth Bennet sets out on a long walk after a rain storm to visit her ailing sister, during which she soils the hem of her skirt with mud. This slight soiling results in a small amount of embarrassment for Elizabeth, who tries to let down her outer garment to hide it, and a great amount of derision behind her back by two nasty female residents of the house she is visiting. Had dirt and shabbiness been the norm in households like Elizabeth's at the time depicted, it is unlikely a little mud on the edge of a skirt would have attracted anyone's notice or rude commentary, and these events in the book would have made no sense. The fact that Austen wrote such a scene and had the characters behave as they do indicates that cleanliness and neatness of dress were normal and expected at that place and time, among that class of people.",2006
1,"This film is one of the worst adaptations of Pride and Prejudice ever filmed and if Jane Austen were alive, she would demand that her name be removed from the film. Austen's novel is only superficially a story of the development of true love between Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy. It is also a commentary on the class structure of Regency Britain. This film focuses only on the love story, thereby disappointing viewers who hoped it would do justice to the novel.",2005
1,This is a deeply dumbed-down version of Austen.,2005
1,Maybe if you've never read any English literature or only ever watched the Hollywood version of any book you might find merit in this awful film. It has the directorial and scripting skill of Shoreditch. The BBC 1995 adaptation is both very enjoyable and close to the book and captures the atmosphere between Elisabeth and Darcy very well.,2005
1,"This film is bad. There are no words that do justice to what this film has done to the most beloved work of one of the greatest English authors. To start with, the film cannot seem to decide when it is set. We see scenes and costumes from a plethora of different historical periods (especially in the ballroom scenes). This is nothing to the dialogue, however, which cannot decide if it wants to be modern or self-consciously antiquated. Apparently just using Austen's dialogue would be too easy. The characters' manners wouldn't fit into any period (see Georgianna Darcy in particular). The scene of Darcy's second proposal appears to have been stolen from a Mills and Boon novel. I can only imagine that the makers of this film have never read the book or were just having a laugh. Even the acting doesn't redeem it, as even great performers collapse under an absurd script. The two leads are particularly bad as they attempt to smoulder. Please do not go to see this film, as giving them money would only serve to encourage this sort of thing.",2005
1,"OK where do I begin? First the writing: the idiot who wrote this screenplay thought himself superior in writing to Jane Austen and decided to replace Austen's superb economy of words with his own ramblings. Second of all the whole story completely lacks the understanding of social interactions and mores that governed the early 19th century British society. At the time, a woman of 19 or 20 was expected to fully run a household and a gentlewoman was expected to handle many servants as well. Kira Knightly plays Elizabeth as a giggling airhead more at home at the main shopping drags of Paris, London and Los Angeles now than in 19th century British countryside. To add to the travesty we have Donald Sutherland playing Mr. Bennet not as a British eccentric but like an ex-hippie. It is as if Sutherland is channeling his character from Kelly's Heroes.",2005
1,"No one go see Pride & Prejudice. It is the most wretched, boring, miserable movie I have seen all year. Keira Knightley does not look or act the part (note how she chooses to act with her chin every time she gets emphatic) and I've sold lumber more charismatic and interesting than the man who plays Mr. Darcy. There are so many clichéd shots (if I ever have to see someone stare at a candle in the foreground for an entire shot while having a conversation, and then blow it out for the scene change, or a door slamming shut with a dull, resounding crash directly into the camera, I may scream.)",2005
1,One evening I met up with a few people to see the new Pride and Prejudice,2006
1,"I am a great lover of Austen's works, especially Pride & Prejudice. The 1995 miniseries is so faithful to the novel its astounding. The actors are well chosen, there isn't modernized language thrown in, and each emotion is handled well. You can't help having your heart skip a beat when Elizabeth and Darcy finally realize they both love each other. You hate Caroline Bingley and Mrs Hurst. But in this latest adaption, its hard to swallow. There is no Mrs. Hurst. The Bennett family look much poorer than they are. Elizabeth walks/dresses/acts in a manner so against what women of that time would. Yes, Elizabeth Bennet is unconventional, but more in the fact that she is not afraid to express her opinions. She is, however, socially capable and proper in the way she carries herself, dresses, etc. In this, Keira walks around in cruddy clothes, and acts as though she should be down on the farm in the Midwestern USA. The scene where Elizabeth and Darcy ""can't sleep"" drove me insane. SHe would never walk out in that! The scene where Bingley just enters Jane's room as well...he would never have done that! If you haven't read the novel or seen the 1995 adaption, you'd probably love this movie. But those who love the novel or love the adaption (or both) will be very disappointed. Why there was a need to adapt this novel again, I don't know. I have nothing left to say. I know Austen would be very unhappy should she be able to see this latest movie.",2005
1,"Sorry to say but was disappointed in the film. It was very very rushed, as I suppose you can understand a movie length version of Pride & Prejudice would be and I felt that a lot of the major scenes were glossed over just to get through the story. As the movie is so rushed, unfortunately you don't get to really know about and feel for each of the characters much at all. ",2005
9,"On first glance, American Dad looks like a carbon copy of Seth MacFarlane's ""other"" show Family Guy. The animation is near identical, the lead character Stan Smith's knuckle headed optimism and in-your-face presentation doesn't so much recall Peter Griffin as grab you by the throat and scream in your face and Roger the alien and Klaus the goldfish work in much the same way Stewie and Brian do in the previous show. So far so very familiar, as though MacFarlane dressed up his fourth FG series with different characters when it was initially cancelled so as to stay on the air but stick with it, and American Dad will eventually reveal itself as a superior cartoon to it's predecessor.",2006
9,"I always liked Family Guy. What it lacked in plot it made up for in outrageous non-sequitur humour and Peter Griffin's ubiquitous laugh. The juxtaposition of random jokes and standard plots made for some hilarious moments. But after season four it got old. It was a great one-dimensional concept while it lasted, but the appeal of a show with wafer-thin plots just to produce set-pieces can't last forever. Enter American Dad and his huge chin.",2006
9,Seth MacFarlane proves he's not a one trick pony with his innovative follow up to the smash hit Family Guy. American Dad! is unfortunately misunderstood as a rip off of it's own predecessor but it is by far not. American Dad! is completely different to Family Guy the only similarities are the art and the amount of characters.,2007
10,"This has to be one of the best adult cartoons ever created. It's hard for me to compare them with Southpark. I think that in many aspects, American Dad is way better than Southpark. Probably because it addresses to a much larger public, while Southpark contains jokes that sometime require some background knowledge, before you can fully understand them. Even for non-Americans, this series are equally funny and enjoying. Great job! I recommend this to anyone who enjoys some good humour. Now we can only hope that the American Dad Seasons will be longer and longer (from what I know a season of American Dad has more episodes than any of its ""rival"" shows). Once again, outstanding work and I hope to see this continue in the future and become a traditional show (and maybe see it promoted in other countries as well).",2007
10,"American dad is amazing. All the whimsical and creative lines they write all following the story line makes it great. Hate to compare it to family guy but it's jokes stay on track to what is happening and doesn't go off on random rants like family guy. Not sure how people are rating this lower but it just goes to show IMDb's scores tend to base on popularity. If you didn't notice big actor movies on here tend to score higher even if they are not very good. And a movie with unknown actors that may be a great movie but won't be scored as high based on popularity. Anywho off the subject American Dad is great. The Alien is outstanding and so is Stan. The only downfall, like all shows as the season progress it usually loses its greatness, the later seasons Stan isn't so CIA crazed pulling his gun out all the time and stuff. He's more office CIA then Crazy CIA Agent. Overall its great though. My favorite",2011
8,"Contains mild spoilersMy favorite Seth McFarlane movie is Family Guy, but American Dad is a great spin off. It's one of my favorite animated shows and I never miss an episode. Seth McFarlane is a comical genius and kind of a wacko. I've liked his other stuff too. I will probably watch anything he makes. This revolves around Stan Smith and his family. He works for the CIA. Other things about it are similar to Family Guy well as the type of humor. If you've seen Family Guy you know what I mean. If you like Family Guy, you will probably like this. Seth McFarlane has this type of humor that's kind of random and pop culture and he throws every joke in but the kitchen sink. You either love it or hate it. I love it, but Family Guy is still my favorite.",2014
10,"American Dad is an adult animated television series that tells the story of Stan Smith, his wife Francine and daughter Hayley, their son Steve and three roommates. These three roommates are very interesting unique characters including the family goldfish Klaus who is a man in a fish body and family Alien, Roger. Hayley's boyfriend Jeff is one of the roommates. There is an uncertainty if Hayley is really Stan's daughter but has been raised as his own in light of that fact. Stan's character is very masculine and can come across as being insensitive and inconsiderate. Francine often raves about wrongdoings in her family insisting on upholding family values. The show is mainly slapstick cartoon comedy and has no real life lessons, it's purely for entertainment but that's okay. - Asif Zamir",2013
10,"When The Simpsons got slow and started losing it's spark Matt Groening decided to focus ideas elsewhere and partnered up with David X Cohen to create Futurama which was expected by many just to be a lame rip off of The Simpsons however it was a smash hit and in my personal opinion is better than The Simpsons.American Dad! went through the exact same thing as everyone expected it to be Seth MacFarlane's Family Guy 2 but once again American Dad! is a huge hit and in my opinion better than Family Guy.We have the basic formulaic family set up the father,mother,brother, an sister but with the addition of an alien and a talking fish were talking a new spin on an old idea.The characters are absolutely amazing and original even better than Stewie or Peter Griffin.We have Stan the overprotective father who works for the CIA and is demeaning,racist,fascist,violent,overbearing,stubborn, and close minded basically a Republican exaggerated and blown way out of proportion.Francine is the semi ditsy mother who keeps to herself and is 100% comfortable being a housewife, she's soft and mothering but with an extremely psychotic side as well.Steve is the geeky teenage son who cares about nothing but boobs and Star Trek his father is ashamed of him as Steve is extremely nerdy.Hayley is liberal hippie daughter who is constantly doing weed,rebelling, protesting, and giving hypocritical speeches during the show basically your exaggerated Liberal blown out of proportion.Roger steals the show as the effeminate alien whom the family found at Area 51 and have been secretly keeping secretly in the attic, Roger is outrageously funny he' whiny, b*tchy, and addicted to TV basically a woman going through a middle aged crisis but in n alien body.Klaus has basically served more as a supporting character the family pet a German talking fish he serves his purpose with some good one liners but he for the most part just gets in the way and it's evident as he is more and more excluded in each episode.The show is nothing like Family Guy this is like Seth MacFarlanes South Park his show to voice his political and social commentary in an extreme over the top and offensive way.This show constantly makes fun of liberals and republicans and carries some of the wittiest and most laugh out loud hilarious lines in TV history not to mention Patrick Stewart as a lovable supporting character named Bullock.American Dad! is amazing political satire without the flashbacks, character similarities, and random humour of Family Guy.",2007
10,this show is actually as good as family guy it has unique comedy and everything it is one of the best shows ever made and it is good the first episode was quite funny then the second then the third i loved it i know its not a popular show but i like it is better than family guy and its one of the greatest show in the world and another thing i like the alien he is genius Seth mcflarine is genius i love his shows especially American dad of course better funnier and bigger than family guy it is one of the funniest show and it will always crack me up and all my friends like it too they think its funny when i show them it and klaws the fish he fancies Francine i mean a fish fancing a human that is unique!,2008
1,"Nowadays the show revolves around pandering to women and teaching the young boys watching it to be wimps and cucks. It's amazing, since in the first few seasons, this show was relatable, had good writing, jokes, and even a serious message in it's plot. Those days are long gone however, as nowadays it's a cringe fest, and even the millions of likes the producers bought for it on Facebook or all celebrity ass-kissing (Kim Kardashian!??? Really?!) can't redeem it or make it authentically relevant again.",2016
10,"First and foremost this is my first IMDb review, so i am pretty excited. American Dad is absolutely hilarious because it has witty charm and the characters are easily likable. Roger, Steve and Stan are the best though because their interactions and dialogues always seem to make me laugh . I believe this is a lot funnier than family guy, which i do still watch. It just offers more from the characters and the jokes and dialogues are just better, plus the plots are interesting with life-long lessons for children and adults at the end. I am 22 years old and some of the jokes won't be caught by others, but when you do understand them then the show will be that much funnier for you(which is saying a lot because its already pretty darn funny!). I can re-watch episodes over and over because the characters and their interactions are always funny and i can honestly say when I am having a rough day this show will always bring my mood up(and then some). Keep it going Seth.",2014
10,"Like Family Guy this show found it's own identity when it first started. My favorite characters are Roger because of his multiple personalities and over the top craziness, Francine with her history of being raised by a Chinese family and also harboring a secret life of stealing valuable items for 20 years, and Steve's awesome singing voice and energetic attitude of bringing new stuff to the table when his family are bored. Stan, Hayley, and Klaus are interesting characters as well. Who doesn't want a gungho CIA agent, a hardcore liberal activist and a German guy trapped in a fish body? I do because I love this show to death after family Guy. I love both shows for different reasons but I love them for their common interests to make me laugh out loud and enjoy these awesome shows.",2016
10,"I really love American Dad. I never know whether to add the ! at the end. Is is really American Dad! Funny. Anyway, I love this show. It is so funny. I remember the first time I watched it. I was about nine and although I didn't understand every joke, as they were a bit mature for me, I instantly knew I'd keep watching it until it got cancelled. Even now, when FOX has cancelled it, they can't keep it from coming back, as TBS has now picked it up instead. My favorite character has to be Roger. Who doesn't love an alien who always dresses as different characters and has different personas? I know I can't resist. My second favorite character is Klaus. I love that he's a fish. Who can talk. Who was a human, at one point. I get a bit bored when the episode centers around either Steve or Haley. But you have to do that sometimes. I do love a good Klaus or Roger centered episode. Obviously I do. Because they're my favorites. Overall this show hasn't had many boring episodes. I know that when I have a marathon there is only one episode I skip, out of the entire series. A very good show, anyone with a sense of humor with love it, overall I give it a 10 out of 10. And I'm not being generous. That's what it deserves.",2014
9,"While Family Guy has degraded into the cesspool of what people can somehow still find funny despite unfunny, recycled jokes; American Dad has stood apart from this and still remains a truly amazing show. Roger the alien is unarguably the greatest character ever created with his selfish attitude and creating hilarious scenarios by constantly changing identities. Very few episodes could be considered bad but even those are better than most other shows. Many people write this show off because they view it as a Seth MacFarlane show but in reality and thankfully Seth has absolutely nothing to do with the show other than the voices. While I do wish that Stan was kept as a Republican lunatic, he actually gotten character development that is important to keep a show from getting stale. More people should at least try the show on Netflix or Adult Swim and see for themselves that hilarity and satire of American Dad.",2013
10,"I can understand why American Dad is better than Family Guy (but I still enjoy it) due to the writers cutting back on the long gag and politics/religion baloney. However, this show started off very slow. Once season 3 came, I grew to love it. This peak of interest would continue until the seventh season. That season shows slight decline, but after that, it thankfully got better again. I liked all the characters in the show (unlike a character was otherwise annoying/mean), but Stan, Steve, Roger, and Klaus (all male main cast) are the funniest. The others had their moments but Francine is much funnier than Hayley. My favorite recurring characters are Avery Bullock (Patrick Stewart), Principal Lewis (yet I understand his attitude changed a lot), Steve's friends, etc. Everyone who think FG sucks now think that is a recommend show. At the same time, I'd agree on that (but not on FG). To be honest, 5 years ago, I stayed away from this show for the most part before eventually being a Regular Amination Domination watcher. But today everything is different.",2013
10,"I for one value American Dad as a show and consider it to be far superior to Family Guy both in overall content and in several specific areas such as characters, dialogs, jokes and so on. To me personally Family Guy lost it's way somewhere after season 5. On the other hand I am yet to find an episode of American Dad to be rushed, shallow or boring. I gladly recommend this show to most people who ask me about it or that I know would enjoy this type of entertainment.",2013
1,"I used to enjoy watching American Dad and thought a bunch of the jokes were funny.But after watching it for a while,I realize how very offensive it is and how very rude a bunch of the characters are.It's like the characters in the show love to ruin their friends and families lives.",2017
