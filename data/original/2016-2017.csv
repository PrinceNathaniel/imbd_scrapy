9,"I think we can all admit that it's hard to create a show that stands out, As we are at a time where television is at it's pinnacle point. So when I started this show I was expecting a mildly entertaining series. What I got, is, a show that is real. So much so, that it brought tears to my eyes. That should tell you all you need to know about this beautiful tale about life. The story revolves around a few characters that seem to be unrelated. Just like the facts that were stated in the beginning of the show. However they have more in common than you realize. What sets this show apart from most, isn't the ending, But the journey you take in-between. As someone who's seen many new shows this year, both comedy and drama, I can say with absolute certainty, this is the most memorable. Not only because of it's outstanding story telling but because of it's cast, who bring life to the story.",2016
9,SPOILER ALERT,2016
10,"I don't write many reviews I'm often tempted but don't get round to it. It might be because most of the time when i'm tempted it's because a series or a films is really really bad, so instead I decided to spend my time tying to find something that's good to watch. Now, I have only watched the first episode and normally I would want to watch a few more before making my mind up but I the case of ""This is us"" I feel compelled to comment on the pilot episode.",2016
9,"This is a very inventive story line so I won't refer to it, except to say that both the first and second episodes have real surprises. Avoid reading any reviews with spoilers. It will dampen your joy as you figure things out.",2016
10,"All too often one ends up writing a review about a show that is less than amazing, often out of frustration, annoyance or plain old bored at yet another half as*ed attempt to get viewers to tune in with little effort on plot, dialogue or acting.",2016
10,Well I did It!My first review.And i am glad that this is my first review.Because....,2016
10,"Wow, what a come back for TV Drama. This is a multi layered, moving and totally relate-able show and so so entertaining. I am already so invested and have only watched two episodes. The leading cast are amazing with some of my all time favorites (looking at you Milo) and supporting cast seem more than adequate to keep up. The writers have their finger to pulse of what is really important to people today and throughout all of time... LOVE. It ticks so many boxes for me. I have been waiting for a show that I can safely watch with kids in the room, without soft porn, violence, bad language, and in general inappropriate story lines. This incredible show proves to be not too soppy, funny enough to break tension, loads of character diversity, Mandy Moore, I mean so many more reasons to fall in love with ""This Is Us"". That is all. Peace out",2016
10,STOP EVERYTHING YOU ARE DOING AND GO WATCH THIS SHOW. ,2016
7,"The first episode was great and draw my attention to this show But then i realized it's just too much drama and emotional scenes And also too much set up, like Jack's death... Overall it's an OK show to get emotional and kill time. Thought it would be as deep as Six Feet Under, but i guess i was just expecting too much.",2017
9,"To give away any spoilers to anyone who has not yet seen the first episode would be criminal. The final few minutes of the episode are spectacular, so be sure to watch it in its entirety...and I don't mean, ""watch it in the background while you do chores or play with your smartphone,"" I mean, ""watch it without any distractions, and pay attention.""",2016
2,"I guess America needed a series where the producers and directors spoon feed them a heavy dose of predictable, childish, and completely overwrought melodrama every week. The only thing surprising about this series is how obvious everything everyone says and does is. The fat triplet - everything is about her weight which I guess gives her the right to be a total bitch to everyone. The actor triplet - immature, self-centered, narcissistic, everything is about him, which apparently gives him the right to be a complete bastard to everyone. The black triplet - angry, lacking self-confidence, defensive to a fault - which makes it OK for him to ruin everyone Else's life. Nothing interesting here except that every week, the show runners attempts at bringing on the tears becomes even more palpable. There is no way this whining time-jumping cistern of pablum can maintain these ratings for long.",2017
10,"This is us is not just the best TV show in a very long time, it is also the most heartfelt with such a beautiful spiritual message. The message is that of LOVE, and that we are all in this together, meaning life. ",2016
4,"Preposterous set-up, (so what's new? that has never stopped network TV before). The real downer is that the show doesn't use the set-up to generate tension or dramatize conflict. Everybody is so perfect and always has exactly the right, politically correct and ""supportive"" response. Every time a dramatic impulse threatens to intrude, the show squelches it.",2016
1,"Boring is not a strong enough word for this show. I have not intentionally watched this show but my wife has had it on because she too is indoctrinated by the driest program I have ever seen. It is drier and more dull than thanksgiving turkey. I don't see what the appeal to this show is, I'm not apposed to drama. It's not a thrilling neck breaker they adopted a black baby the night that their third triplet died upon birth. The show jumps around with no sort of creative cohesiveness at all. The two biological kids look absolutely nothing alike. I guess I'm not suppose to get this. Not everything is for everyone but good Christ these stories are so boring.",2016
2,"I knew the twist in the storyline before I began the first episode. I have no idea how they will continue with this gimmick ;but I barely made it through the first episode. All the emotions and story lines are are perfect "" Hollywood Fake"". This show is cloyingly sentimental and predictable. The opening shots of the the woman battling her weight were clich√©d and downright stupid. The post it notes in her refrigerator were ridiculous and not funny or touching. Not one thing in this show feels authentic. Really,I can't say enough negative about this show. The forced writing and syrupy acting make this show totally unwatchable.",2016
6,"The pilot was absolutely brilliant. Four characters at pivot points in their life, and it felt satisfyingly concluded by the end of the episode when they all decided to change. Sometimes you don't need to show the complete follow-through. To me, the most important thing happened in the first episode. Everything genuine happened there. It all feels so stretched now. I'll grant that on occasion, a good and genuine moment happens, but they have become few and far between, not even every episode. I'm on the sixth episode, and I think it'll be my final one. I'm straining to care about most of the characters, and the only one I do genuinely care about is William, and I don't think it a stretch to believe he won't live out the season, maybe not even the next few episodes, given how his character was established. I enjoy sappiness, I really do, but I enjoy it only when it can be genuine.",2016
5,"If you liked The Blind Spot you are going to like this. Predictable, manipulative, melodramatic and as dull as it can get. In various promotion interviews they've bragged that the success of the show comes from how real and relateable it is. That makes me want to laugh out loud. I've rarely seen a show that was more phony and inauthentic. It's an easy trick that writers use when they are lazy, but want to come off as being ""real"": put in some deaths, broken families, a fat girl struggling with her weight, and you won't have to make an effort to create good plot and character development. People will just eat it up. So really, the success of this show comes from the fact that people like to be fed corny crap with no substance. Nothing wrong with that, but personally I've found that even a marvel superhero movie have truer dialogue and more relateable characters than this. Also, I might not have been so aggressively against this show it if hadn't been hyped up and overrated to this extreme point. 8.9?? Are you kidding me?",2017
3,"This show isn't terrible and it has some interesting moments, but I'm finding the characters, yes the same ones everyone else is in love with, to be fairly hard to like.",2016
10,I just finished watching the entire season and I am stunned. This series is so effective and emotional yet extremely original. You will fall in love with each character as they are all completely different. I can't help but feel empathy for all of the major characters. You learn about their flaws but also the attributes that make them so unique and crucial to the show. ,2017
4,"Okay - what am I missing? I noticed a Tweet from the wonderful (and underrated) Janet Montgomery, saying that she's in episode four of this series, so I thought it must be British. But no, it's American. So I thought I'd better catch up with previous episodes via All4 streaming. I also read a review online - from the Evening Standard, I think - which said I should have tissues handy. I may be a grown man but I have been known to sob out loud at certain scenes in movies and TV, so fine.",2016
10,"I was hooked from the 1st minute of this show. The acting is stellar and Gerald McCraney was impeccable. When he was sitting in the chair next to Jack telling how he lost his first child, i could not hold back the tears... it was beautiful and touching. The best part for me was the ending. I just LOVED how they went back to the 70's (hence the smoking in the hospital and the outfits) to show where the 3 grown adults ( Kate, Kevin & Randall)are in life and to then disclose that they are all related (Kate and Kevin I knew) but Randall being adopted by the parents to make it the three they vowed to bring home, was amazing! I cannot wait for Episode 2 :)",2016
8,"The ""Pilot"" episode follows several story lines including pretty boy actor Kevin (Justin Hartley) looking for something more substantial in his career and life, Chrissy Metz as his sister Kate who is struggling with her weight and looking for love, young couple Rebecca and Jack (Mandy Moore and Milo Ventimiglia) who are expecting triplets and Randall (Sterling K Brown), a successful business man looking for his biological father who abandoned him as a newborn.",2016
1,How is this nominated for an Emmy? This is the most predictable unintelligent story I have ever seen. The acting is terrible. The show is cheesy and sappy. The worst television show I have seen in years. From the guy who made Crazy Stupid Love. Well this show is stupid so I guess he is good at making a stupid show popular.,2017
6,"Little things can have a big effect on your enjoyment of a show. This one instantly alienated me with the opening song, which had a kind of sensitivity-indie-schmaltzy vibe. In general I'm not a fan of using songs to convey emotion, because it's usually a cheap trick, and starting the series like that was offputting. ",2016
2,"A lot of people come from dysfunctional families and bad parents. Because of this, many do not adjust to the trials and tribulations of life. They don't learn to not be guided or swayed by emotion and impulse, which is subject to changed moods. They don't know how to learn from mistakes. If something works out in their lives, it is despite circumstances. They are fragile emotionally and can't stand the idea of compromise or delayed gratification. Many have addictive personalities and mood swings.",2017
8,"I really, really liked Deadpool. And you know what? I didn't expect to. Seriously, I was never a fan of the character (in the sense that I hardly knew anything about him) and the humor as well as the violence seemed forced and overdone in the trailers. Still, I remained interested in the film, I just never expected it to actually be good - until the reviews arrived. After most critics unexpectedly showered this newest superhero movie with praise, I went in cautiously optimistic (but still fully prepared to hate the film).",2016
8,"Deadpool is a triumph of artistic vision over studio interference. Little credit should be given to 20th Century Fox, as they had zero faith in the success of a Deadpool movie. To put things into perspective, Ryan Reynolds fought for this film back in 2004 when Blade: Trinity was released. Reynolds and co. went to shoot test footage that was then leaked online by Reynolds because Fox had no intentions to release it to the public. Finally, after years and years of BEGGING to the studio and the overwhelming positive responses of the test footage from the public, Fox didn't even tell Reynolds and co. that the film was greenlit. They had to find out online like the rest of us plebeians. If that sounds bad, Fox even cut their budget by $7 million AT THE LAST MINUTE, which caused the writers to scratch some action sequences that I'm sure would've been great to see.",2016
10,"Firstly I would like to state that it is completely hilarious reading reviews with One Star because the movie had ""Foul Language"" and ""Sex Scenes"" or that someone had no idea that the movie was inappropriate for their 9 year old kid. Dead Pool is rated R and with 3 minutes of research you could have determined if this movie was for you or not With that being said I will not delve into the plot but the acting and writing were fantastic. Ryan Reynolds nailed this role. If you are easily offended by violence, language, or nudity this is not the movie for you but if you have a sense of humor and want to be entertained for 2 straight hours you will love this movie.",2016
10,Deadpool is a 2016 film that the eighth film in the X-Men franchise where The Merc with the Mouth seeks revenge in a humorous way.,2016
9,"At first glance, Deadpool seems like a typical superhero movie due to it being made by Marvel. But once those hilarious intro credits show up, you know you are in for one of the most creative films in recent years. ",2016
1,One word describes this movie - pointless.,2016
1,If you enjoy sitting in on conversations that are typical of young and foolish teenage boys this is the movie for you. Every other line contains the F word and for some reason the director thought penis jokes are the funniest around.,2016
1,"Truly awful rendition of a Marvel superhero. Turgid, adolescent and inane, routine CGI effects and a plot you could write on the back of a postage stamp. The so-called comedy lines are expelled as if from a failing gattling gun, interspersed with fantasy fillers including masturbation, soft toys and sex in Christmas sweaters. If this is you're thing - I suppose, go for it. Everyone else stay well clear. ",2016
9,"If anyone else could be cast to play Deadpool, he certainly doesn't exist in this universe. After Ryan Reynolds's dramatic failure in the Green Lantern film, he has returned to the comic book world. Reynolds is absolutely phenomenal as the foul mouthed, and witty antihero. I mean he is just superb! He completely owns the role, and gives a fantastic performance. If Robert Downey Jr. IS Iron Man, then Ryan Reynolds IS Deadpool. He is also such a liveable character, and by the end of the film, I genuinely cared about Deadpool. I never thought I'd say that. All of the performances are great. No one holds a candle to Reynolds, but I will say not one person was miscast here.",2016
1,"Out of all Marvel movies made, Deadpool was the worst. The main character talks too much it became very annoying after 5 minutes. The jokes were not funny. The scene transition between flashbacks and present conditions were not well done.",2016
1,"This was one of the worst films I have viewed in years and appropriately, it should have been named Dread Pool.",2017
2,"First off, I do not read comics so I do not know the source material, I am not a fan-boy of Marvel or DC I just want to see entertaining movies, I may be in the minority at least during it's first week of being in theaters but I wanted to write a review to warn others what Deadpool is like.",2016
1,"I wish I could give rating in minus, like minus 5 . I don't know why people think it's a great movie. if this movie is rated 8.6 or 8.7 it must be out of 100. I would rather sit at home and watch Hancock twice than watching Deadpool. Movie is nothing more but parody of X-Men movie. There is NO story-line. I felt so dumb to go watch this movie in theater. They tried to put some adult comedy but its not worth spending time and money for it. It was not a love story from any angle nor it was funny. Ryan Reynolds sucks - just like he did in green lantern and any other movie. Apart from few adult jokes, all I saw/heard was his BLABBER in front of camera.",2016
1,"The film is made out of Ryan Reynolds, throwing lame jokes to the camera. In between there are bullets and knifes. No surprises. No ideas. The story is simple and silly and boring. Man sleeps with woman long in different scenes (Teens hello! Better watch porn, there are more details!) Man go's to basement to become special. (Teens like to be special) Man becomes special and kills all bad guys around him. THE END",2016
1,"Barney the Dinosaur is more entertaining than this movie. yeah sure, when he cracks one or two jokes, its funny, but my gosh he would go on and on ! ",2016
8,"I am aware that to many people (especially those unfamiliar with Deadpool comic or Marvel comics at all) this movie would seem too gory, unnecessary brutal and excessively violent. But this movie is a comedy, where its main protagonist, Deadpool, should be perceived as a comedian, and Ryan Reynolds did an excellent job representing this character.",2016
1,i expected an epic out of this but i rather got boring and juvenile story.,2016
1,"Too overrated, i think the jokes that are included in the movie are interesting, but to be honest the plot is kinda boring and made me bored while i'm watching this.",2016
1,"Where do I start. This movie seems to be scripted by 3 17year old boys. The Gay sex and masturbation inuendo as boring. It was bad from start to finish. Here is the review for those you fine tactless sex seems boring like myself. I'm not saying there should not be sex in movies, but this just makes the whole thing a farse. it was awful, no wonder it has a 16 rating. Don't bother wasting your money, just wait for it to appear in Nexflix in 6 months. It was a failed xmen movie or a paridy on the xmen? if they want to show playboy in the cinema they should just say so and I would avoid it. Apart from the failed script, there is the failed actors in the movie (in my opinion). There are no redeeming features to the movie. I'm sure some will love it, I didn't.",2016
2,"If I've to keep it short - the movie is really, really bad.",2016
1,"This movie is a huge disappointment, and a waste of money and time. The jokes are stupid and I realize that Deadpool is not what it was cracked up to be. Too bad as I usually love the Marvel movies. It seems forced, and the jokes actually become tedious and not really with any sophistication at any level, more adolescent bathroom style humor. The story and plot is also dull and tedious which goes along with the dull and tedious jokes. At times I thought to walk out, but kept hoping that there would be a redeeming aspect as many of the reviews were positive, I kept hoping. This movie is more about money-making hype, with its non existent story/plot and childish humor with no depth. A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.",2016
1,"We live in a time where super hero movies are all the rage. Who doesn't love a good super hero throw down, cool origin stories, and awesome villains? While decent hero flicks are easy enough to find, occasionally a masterpiece, like ""The Dark Knight"", will come along and in the process wow the critics and audiences alike.",2016
1,"The level of content is for the first graders, except peppered with obscenities and curse words all over, this is what makes it rated R. I guess that's the only difference these days between the mature audience and children. I can't understand how in the world people would rate it 10 with an average of 8+. I can't rely on average rating as a measure of movie quality anymore. Seriously, this is the worst experience in a long long time. Spider-man is a much better movie, although I am not fond of childish superhero movies either, but at least they would give you some positive charge, improve your mood. This one teaches you nothing. waste of time and money.",2016
1,"Its an overrated movie with curses written by some 12 year old. No story, no real plot, the film could have done without the villain. This film deserves a 5 or 6 stars at the highest. The reason I am giving it a 1 is due to its over rating. The film mainly attract audiences of 16-25 years. Just a cash grab film. Simply marvel's worst. And there's the feminism there. The heroine always has to save the hero now. Ryan's acting was good in this movie. It suited him. The cgi wasn't bad. But if this movie were to come out before the Iron man then it would've got 4-5 stars. There are some marvel films which deserve higher rating instead of this movie .",2016
1,"I'd never heard of this film, the only reason I sat through it all was because I was on a long distance flight and it was part of the inflight entertainment. Entertained, I was not. ",2016
9,"On the basis of seeing the first episodes of this Masterpiece drama, broadcast in the UK by ITV, I can freely say that I am hooked on to it. Daisy Goodwin's script is both taut and cleverly written, while the performances of the main protagonists are uniformly convincing. I particularly like Jenna Coleman's characterization of the young Queen - so apparently vulnerable yet possessed with an inner strength of will that enables her to resist the repeated blandishments of her self-interest mother the Duchess of Kent (Catherine H. Flemming), who so dearly desires to assume the title of Regent, aided and abetted by her unscrupulous ally Sir John Conroy (Paul Rhys).",2016
9,"I have eagerly anticipated this mini series ever since Jenna left Doctor Who and announced she was to play the famous Monarch. Period dramas have been hit and miss of late, we've had Jericho, War and Peace, Doctor Thorne etc, I'll leave you consider which were hits.",2016
5,"Such a disappointment. Beautifully shot and acted - but the scripts? Teenage angst? Mommy and daddy issues? Nobody understands me? Whiney, catty relatives? Was not the life of Victoria compelling enough? ",2016
8,"In years gone by, we Brits (and presumably others also) watched - rather addictively - such series as ""Edward the Seventh"" with Timothy West (1975), ""Edward and Mrs Simpson"" with Edward Fox (1978) and ""Lillie"" (also 1978) - about Mrs Langtry as Edward VII's lover while Prince of Wales, and hence covering some of the same ground. In each case they seemed to be well-done, featuring a host of stars and apparently looking for all the world like they were presenting the real thing.",2017
7,"It starts very well. They give a nice insight into an 18yo girl, totally protected and kept from everything except her family, suddenly dropped into the position of Queen of the most powerful country on the planet. Not unexpected, but completely unprepared. The early episodes are very good. Melbourne and Peel are both very well done and the drama does what it should do, it breathes life into history.",2016
9,"I was so looking forward to watching Victoria and I have not been disappointed. Having a keen interest in English history, especially of the Royal Family, I am obsessed with this series. I has been anxiously awaiting each new episode. Costuming is perfection, and the actors are are superb. I could not think of anyone better to play Queen Victoria. If you love period drama and English history, you will be enthralled by Victoria. I wish there was more shows like this on television. A definite must for fans of this genre. The betrayal of Lord M and Victoria's relationship may be elaborated a bit, but the basis of this show is worth the watch.",2016
10,"Victoria is an excellent show. Granted, the CGI in the film is rubbish, but the costumes and the set are marvelous. Even though Jenna Coleman does not resemble Queen Victoria at all, I feel that she portrays Queen Victoria beautifully. I love it when she tells others that she will not be pressurized into doing anything she does not want. Her comebacks are amazing when anyone belittles her. Every feminist should watch this. The romance between Queen Victoria and Lord Melbourne, though untrue as there was no evidence suggesting a relationship other than a platonic one, is extremely entertaining. Rufus Sewell, though too handsome to be Lord Melbourne, is so charming and smoldering. Their on screen chemistry is so good that I really do not want Albert to come into the story to ruin things between Queen Vic and Lord M. I say, to hell with historical accuracy!",2016
5,"As in other reviews I would praise the performance of Jenna Coleman. However, this is a chance missed by ITV. The script rattles along at a good pace but the dialogue is GCSE standard. Scene's opening with lines like ""We must discuss my position as Queen Mother"" or ""can I help, as Queen, could I intervene"" are just trite and the script is littered with them. The CGI is a little wonky, but on the whole it is an engaging piece of TV. Not up there with the best historical TV drama, but fair to middling. So It gets a 6 from me. Just PLEASE ITV don't let Daisy script her own ideas anymore. Get someone in to polish that dialogue!",2016
8,"I am enjoying the show as a period piece and not for its historical accuracy. I am not sure what the future episodes will reveal, but hopefully not Victoria as a loving devoted mother, which she was not. Reading her journals and letters, and especially letters to her adult children over the years reveals a woman who hated being pregnant, did not like babies at all, and considered one of her son's unfortunate because he was an ugly baby. She thought babies resembled frogs. She despised and was revolted by breastfeeding, which probably is not uncommon back then, and rarely spent any time with her young children and preferred to spend most of her time with Albert of whom she was devoted to and passionate about privately, but in her letters she blamed men for many of women's woes. They both desperately wanted to create a loving and warm family, which unfortunately, they failed to do for the most part. I feel the actors are doing the best they can with the script and you are never going to portray the accuracy of a period and relationships between people when you are not their to witness it. You can only go by accounts, and documents written in their hand, but that does not truly reveal who they really are either.",2017
6,"Distinguished writer and historian of Victorian England A.N. Wilson is associated with the production but it seems difficult to imagine him accepting the distortions to history the production applies. It is as much about tone as about fact. The film ""Mrs Brown"" seemed to hit all right notes in all the different places - upstairs, downstairs, conversations between courtiers - and their very different tone when directly addressing Victoria. All providing the context for their shock and horror at Brown's extreme familiarity with her.",2016
2,"The cinematography is wonderful. The clothes are beautiful. The set where it all takes place is breathtaking. The major casts are all good looking. There's a lot of hype about this movie, but it all stops there. What were the writers thinking? Where's the excitement in this movie? How dare the critics compare this to Poldark, which is filled with excitement. It was hard to keep my eyes open it was so boring.",2017
2,"I concur with most of the negative reviews here, while allowing for the fact that great screenwriters should and do take liberties with historical material. The art is in making compelling and revealing stories from those liberties. There are marvelous tales hidden in the history of Victoria and Albert, but it requires hard work to bring them to life.",2017
9,"Jenna Coleman's acting is worth an award. Camera work by John Lee is extraordinary (the right eye for detail), music is extremely well suited, the costumes are exquisite. It's a feast for the eye and while looking at it you just tend to forget the quibbles about it's historical mistakes.",2017
3,"I can't really emphasize enough how shallow, boring, silly, poorly written and annoying this show is. They can dress up these actors in colorful velvets and gold buttons, and stuff them into lushly carpeted castles all they want, but this will not make up for a lack of vision, message, theme, and perspicacity. Victoria complains a lot, yes she does. She's bored and put upon, annoyed by being pregnant, by her nagging mother, by puppy love, and other such trifles, and dramatic music comes along to make her boring boredom supposedly seem dramatic and important. But nothing important ever really happens. These characters hang about. The days go by. They complain. Politicians drop by to bother them about insubstantial minutia that never resonates or ties together into an interesting plot. Victoria doesn't think or talk about all that much...doesn't DO all that much. She and Albert love each other but it's hard to see why. The actor playing Albert always seems ready to drift into a nap mid-sentence. The actor playing Peel is particularly miscast. Victoria and Melbourne are played well enough but they are hobbled by the shallowness of what is asked of them. Finally, the ""B-stories"" are a particular slap in the face to the viewer. Taking their cue from Upstairs and Downton the writers made a feeble and slapdash effort to get us interested in a cook and a maid servant - to no avail. They might as well be singing, ""la la la, we're here to say something, until the main characters return to the screen... la la la."" The main characters are not much better. It's really hard to care about them and it is easy to forget that they supposedly represent such important symbols/figures of an age. They might just be some boring people living in a house if someone didn't take a shot at them once in a while. No spoiler here. We know from history books that Queen V lived to a ripe old age. However, someone should have put this costume clunker out of it's misery.",2016
10,"As a director of stage, not involved with any of this, I'm very impressed by Victoria the movie. Because somehow the wall between theater and movie is gone when you get involved with this story and cast. Of course because the girl who plays Victoria is very convincing, (although it could be any queen any time, any place..which I like very much) and of course also because of Lord M. played by the always very intense playing Rufus Sewell. Of course there is also a movement of telling these stories as realistic as one can imagine, like The Crown or like we in Holland have..same sort of such series. I think them less interesting because it is not as well played, to complicated to survive time, and it never can be reality, because we are NOW. So I do love the more timeless stories, where the tension and communication between the personages is most worked out! Of course Victoria is also very beautifully made,on amazing locations. I'm a great fan of British television costume drama..",2017
1,Wonderful cast and scenery! The production is lavish and the actual story-line so poor it's straight out of a harlequin romance! If you like trash you will love this inaccurate portrayal of a woman who earned the right for her true story to be told. If you love beautiful period costumes and great houses just turn down the sound. It unbearable to listen to the tripe and untruths ,2017
1,"Most of the history dumbed-down to incomprehensible. Characters like Cumberland are... simply evil with no understanding of ""why?"" .... a son of George iii and a king in his own right. Rufus Sewell spent two hours looking lost and seemed to wonder if he could just jump ahead to 1848 and die. Jenna Coleman managed to keep the same expression on her face through the entire episode...probably bored with the whole thing. OK...it was pretty...",2017
8,"What's more entertaining than being transported back into history and being RIGHT THERE with young Queen Victoria, Lord Melvin and all the other super compelling characters in play ?? OK..besides that... and that !! Jenna Coleman must be superb to make this mini-series work. And, yes, as stated..this show WORKS! Let's give it up for Ms. Coleman. And Lord Melvin must also be just as compelling. And indeed, Rufus Sewell is impeccably cast and as always, turns in an outstanding performance. Of course the costumes and cinematography and sets must also be right on, and of course-they are brilliant! The only obstacle in the way of a 10 of 10 rating, is the rather too familiar , basic theater plot and script. However, this seemingly necessary evil is overshadowed by the cast, costumes, sets, cinematography etc. One makes slight notice of the too familiar villains and good guys and intrigues but, still remain steadfast and mesmerized by the unfolding drama. You, me and everyone else..is firmly in little lady Vic's corner!! I can not wait for the next installments. No, I mean I REALLy can not wait! Thus, I'm forming my own ensemble-including Victoria's dog Dash. I must first find a suitable replacement for Ms. Coleman..how about YOU ?? {call me....}",2016
5,"At least, I feel that way. I usually like UK series very much; for example, War & Peace (2016) was a great adaptation, with a good script, excellent portrait of the time and quite good actors. I think there are two main traditions in that country: one seems to come from Shakespeare and has produced the best in theater and TV story telling, no matter if it was political (State of play), police gender (Morse, various DCI, Happy Valley, Line of duty recently), or social (Shameless, Hit and Miss) -won't deny I'm a Paul Abbot fan- and another one that is about social history, romance and book adaptations, with quite good representatives (Cranford, The Forsyte Saga or even Upstairs and Downton Abbey). Sometimes the first one is not so good, but still have something worthy, or maybe I have been very lucky choosing what to watch. But the second one has come from John Glasworthy, Jane Austen and so on to Barbara Cartland and Jean Plaidy/Victoria Holt. This has been happening lately with TV series from which I expected more, like Poldark and, now, Victoria. Such a good opportunity to make a historical and interesting biopic about XIXth century England and a landmark queen spoiled with clich√©s, bad -really bad- script, and a lot of cloying relationships that should have been interesting, like Victoria and Melbourne. And is difficult to blame the actors, since even Rufus Sewell looks ridiculous in it. Everything is so simple and predictable that becomes boring. It's customary to say here that it's OK: this kind of series has it's audience. But i truly believe that a better one historical romance could have been done, and the same audience would have been better served. Maybe I wouldn't have been so disappointed if the IMDb rating have not been so high. I wonder why this series have as many stars as War& Peace. Maybe next time I should wait for 10.000 people to rate, or perhaps I should stay away from historical and romance series until the eager to find a new Downton success is over. Downton was smart made in UK Disney for adults; Victoria is flat Barbara Cartland Queen history for teenagers just that year that they fall in love with love. I hope such a character will find some day a good script with a good cast and deeper insight of the era.",2017
8,"Cute is the adjective here. Because I hardly believe that the real Victoria was as cute as J. Coleman. This little birdie of nearly 5 ft. is a real delight (at least they got the height right). The only thing that kinda bugs me is that they just couldn't fix the eyes. The contacts made her eyes look like from another world or dimension. Other than that, superb and actually interesting series handling some history from the era. Some with accuracy, some less accurate. Sewell is one of my favorites. I'm used to him playing the bad guy or some kind of dark character who turns out the be the hero (Dark City), but in this he's superb as the helpful Lord Melbourne.",2016
2,"Because a woman wrote/directed this show, I am curious to see more of it up to a point. Otherwise, I would not watch it at all. The show seems like the usual patriarchal denial of female maturity, independence, & intelligence; it focuses too much on her personal life & not enough on the juicy stuff of her accomplishments & the brilliance that led to them. ",2016
6,ITV has decided to go back to the period dramas with yet another miniseries on the last Hannover queen and first Saxe-Coburg-Gotha even if they nowadays called themselves Windsor.,2016
8,"I was never a fan of costume drama, couldn't stand Downton Abbey but I have to admit, this one has me hooked. I know it's not historically accurate but it doesn't matter, it's not meant to be. It's a dramatization, nothing more. The acting is fantastic and the writing superb. It's nice to watch a show that has a story. It looks like ITV have taken over from the BBC as being the one to write the better period drama's. From what I am hearing though, ITV have become somewhat greedy and showing far too many adverts during the show...thankfully I don't have to watch it back home in the UK. Anyway, other than that, well done ITV, a fantastic show and hopefully many more to come.",2016
8,"While neither as densely packed as Downton Abbey nor as confrontational as Indian Summers, Victoria is a satisfying entry in the lush English teledrama genre. Jenna Coleman is excellent as the young, headstrong queen, and there's something interesting about the mix of royal grace and petulant teen. The rest of the cast is also quite good.",2016
4,... it has a lot of problems.,2016
3,"The show is pretty much your classic MTV show, piled on top of Terry Brooks' novels. Female empowerment angle? Check. Lazy exposition where a character says things for no reason other than to inform the audience? Check. Teenagers being super moody, irrational, all while doing cool things? Check. It's far from the worst thing I have ever watched, but also far from what could have been done with these novels. The show is largely targeted at the young teen crowd, and you can see elements of twilight all over it.",2016
9,"As someone who has read almost every book in the Shannara series multiple times, I can understand why there is such an uproar about this show being picked up by MTV. However, after last night's two hour premiere I found myself very excited about this series. Now for a quick breakdown of what I liked and disliked:",2016
2,"*general sort-of spoilers throughout* I wasn't hoping for much with this series, but I was expecting something like a teenager-filled legend of the seeker kind of thing with a bigger budget. This was just...no. I haven't read the books so I can't comment on their relation to the show. However, I can say that they weren't good at all. The first two episodes had terrible pacing; at first nothing was happening and then halfway into episode 2, 2 major characters are revealed without any breathing room or reaction time from the main characters. I'd heard the visuals were good, so i was at least looking forward to that. The location scout did a good job and the cgi artists did more or less OK with what they had (for a TV show) but the whole production design is pretty awful. I'm not sure what they're going for with the elves design-wise but there's a complete lack of any sort of motifs, color scheme, etc, that unifies them and makes them stand apart..other than a sort of vaguely modern 70's flower child look. (still not sure how elves are supposed to be different from humans, other than the really cheap-looking ears, because they never bothered to explain it) ",2016
1,"They changed the story regarding the locales of the main characters. This was obviously to save money because it would have required gnomes and dwarfs. They added trolls for no reason; which wasn't expensive, because, in the creator's view, they are just people wearing gas masks. They appeared to have gotten rid of the Reaper, one of the most important characters in the entire story. That's probably to reduce cost on CGI. They changed Paranor into a ruin instead of a naturally guarded keep, and changed the demonic attack on it to a hallucination of a duel. Again, penny pinching. They immediately introduced Rovers and have them steal the Elfstones, when they have nothing to do with the story until 2/3 through the book. This is probably to remove minor actors and death scenes-- saving money. The only story change they arguably did to make it easier for non-readers to understand the story was change Wil from a 3/4 man into a halfling. ",2016
2,"I've been a fan of Terry Brooks since the mid 1980's and am another of the host of folks that have read all of his books (from the Shannara / Word-Void and the Magic Kingdom universes). I like his writing style and the stories are compelling. And yes, Sword of Shannara, the big first book that was skipped for this TV series is indeed highly similar to Lord of the Rings. But still entertaining, so I say, so what.",2016
7,"I have not read the source books (never even knew they exist), so I do not have any reference to how much the TV version deviates from it. But I found the world presentation pretty good, all the overgrown technology etc. I would welcome a bit more of the other races (Gnomes/Dwarves), but it might be too soon for that.",2016
1,"The dialogue is downright awful. Elves which should embody some foreign qualities talk like teenagers. The whole TV series is just another show cheaply produced for teens. Instead of making a TV show that could be comparable to Game of Thrones, if done right, they produced absolute trash. The show has few redeeming qualities. I am disappointed Terry Brooks would sell the rights to such trash. The characters are weak because they are something you would find on a show like Twilight. The changes to the story from the book detract from the show instead of adding to it.",2016
1,"These MTV elves are the most narrow-minded, racist, blood thirsty elves I have ever encountered. So much for an enlightened, life loving people.",2016
1,"1st of all I haven't read the books, from the other reviews I get the feeling they are quite good and I will surely read them.",2016
1,"Let me begin this review by saying that I know that changes are made when books and book series are filmed. I know filmmakers do make changes and sometimes they succeed in an amazing way (Game of Thrones and LotR are excellent), but they also fail miserably (Legend of the Seeker is total waste of money).",2016
2,"Huge fan of the first three books (Sword, Elfstones, and Wishsong), which I read when they came out during the late 70s through the mid-80s. Personally, I thought the series was unreadable after the first three books, so I believe I never read past book five. The Elfstones of Shannara is to this day my favorite novel. The first book, Sword of Shannara is more or less a Lord of the Rings rip-off, but I thought it significantly written better, without the fluff of The Lord of the Rings, think a dark version of the Lord of the Rings. With that said, its no wonder they started with Elfstones as Sword would actually appear to be a Lord of the Rings rip-off on screen as well. ",2016
1,The pre-release trailer gave me great hope of a faithful adaption.,2016
2,"Horrible. Don't watch it if you are a fan of the books. Only watch it if you are a teenager who doesn't care about bad actors' performances, sloppy writing, the violation of the original books, clich√© action and over the top effects that looks like something from an 80:s adventure film.",2016
1,I have signed up to IMDb just to bring you this review - beware of what this turns in - the first two episodes were/are free (on Amazon) and promised a little. No Game of Thrones but enough going on that I was going to pay for the Series. ,2016
1,"I have read The Sword of Shannara like 10 times i bought book in book sale while i was kid, and sine that it was my favorite book, later on i have read all other books multiple times and i was fascinated. U Call this TV show? Really? Don't call it TV show, stop casting it because its totally not made like book was written. Terry Brooks doesn't deserve this!!! Allanon who have BIG HEAVY SWORD is shown in TV show with light saber sword? None in book said that there was ancient people on Earth { ex humans {us} with tanks ships and helicopters} they just said that humans was on extinction and that they are trying to survive... In TV show Elf's are presented so bad, they looks like actors from ""The Hunger Games""... They city is totally moderated like new ages. U REALLY SKIP FIRST BOOK AND MAKE TV SHOW WITH SECOND BOOK?? -_- Stop this please!",2016
1,"I really can't believe that Terry Brooks was this hard up for money to have let someone butcher his treasured series of books like this unless of course he has simply become another greedy troll (npi). I understand as with all directors that changes have to be made to condense novels of this magnitude i.e. LotR's, but what has been done with this series is simply disgraceful. The storyline is all over the place introducing characters and history that never existed. Once more the novels we're very clean reading with care being given to the romantic undertones whereas the show has to cheapen it not only with sexual overtones, but lesbian innuendo's as well (when will directors understand that most people find this completely disgusting and disgraceful?). I had hopes of letting my son watch this thinking that it would be good family entertainment likening unto the LotR's even though it was on MTV. What a huge disappointment. Nothing like selling your soul to the Devil; right Terry? If your a fan of the novels your wasting your time with this show. The only good thing that came from watching the first couple episodes was giving me the taste for going back to reread these epic novels which never disappoint and actually have lessons to be learned from (Something MTV will never acquire).",2016
4,"This seems like a series riding on the success of Game of Thrones. A little science fiction, a little fantasy, sword-fighting and demons. That doesn't have to be a bad thing, I like fantasy novels and there have been very few fantasy series worth mentioning, while science- fiction has had it's fair share of good series.",2016
3,"Having just finished the 10th and final episode of the Shannara Chronicles, I sat back and wondered why I ventured past episode two. The juvenile story line, boy meets girl, boy also meets princess, boy goes off on an adventurous quest with both girl and princess, all while the audience is left to wonder which will be the lucky winner of our young hero's affections. The princess or the peasant. The only redeeming feature of the series was the CGI graphics which were somewhat captivating.",2016
1,"Just watch anything else. Trust me. I LOVE fantasy. I LOVE sci-fi. This is neither. The costumes, the story-line, the 5000 year old TRUCKS that still has tires? The make-up, the stiff acting. Did I mention the story-line? Because there really isn't one. The thinnest gruel of a series EVER. Oliver Twist would have died of starvation on the first page had he been served something so vehemently thin and totally bland. Just don't. I wish I could have done something else with my life instead of watching those first 3 episodes. In the vain hope it would ""pick up"". It didn't. The best acting is done by....(spoiler alert!) the Tree!",2016
10,"I've read the Terry Brooks books for over 25 years. I've read all of them and I love them. Is this show a faithful adaptation to the letter of those books? No. Is the show terrible? Absolutely not. Any review that says it's low-budget with sub-par effects is trolling. Pure and simple. The show has effects equal to any on network or premium television and is in the same league as some big budget movies. It has the spirit of the Shannara books and I found it fun, entertaining and exciting. The first couple of episodes were a bit rushed making story transitions that were likely days seem like mere moments but that is a minor issue. My rating system is simple if I was entertained and want to see more then it at least gets a 7. I can watch it with my teenagers then it gets an 8. If I liked it enough to write a review - 10. I hope MTV keeps sex out of it (there's some near-nudity in the first 2 episodes that could have been skipped). It's not necessary and Brooks' books simply don't have it. I like the cast, the acting is actually decent (despite the ridiculous troll reviews) and in some instances good. If you like high fantasy, you will probably enjoy this. If you hate seeing young people portraying young people, or don't like fantasy then stay away.",2016
1,"The Shannara Chronicles is a curious mix of big-budget CGI with ""Hey Dude, Where's My Car?"" screenplay. A rather elaborate Dungeons & Dragons set for sexy teenagers wearing leather tights. The economics escapes me.",2016
2,"Full disclaimer, Elfstones is my favorite book of all time and I've read everything Terry Brooks has ever written. I completely understand that there will be challenges in translating written source material to a visual medium, and you will never ever make the fans of the source material happy no matter what you do because it's a fool's errand. Nothing visual will ever satisfy the imagination in a reader's head. And not every book has Peter Jackson and $200 million waiting in the wings.",2016
1,"As a huge TB fan I've been waiting for a movie of Elfstones (which is my favorite of all his books)since I was a kid. When the LOTR movies came out I continued to cross my fingers that a worthy version of Elfstones would be put out. Imagine my excitement when I heard this was being made. Then I heard by MTV. Not a good sign. But I heard TB was on board and happy with it so I was hopeful. Now we are given this mess of a show. The dialogue itself makes me cringe. This is my first ever review. In fact I just signed up for IMDb right now so I could write this. That's how disappointed I am. For those of us who love this book I'll refrain from nitpicking the little details that I'm sure we all agree on. The fact that it doesn't look anything like the medieval kind of world I imagined, the clothes, etc. Anyway my one question to TB is this. ""Mr. Brooks, I heard over the years that you refrained from letting this get made into a movie until you found the ""right"" situation. This is the ""right"" situation you were referring to?"" I just can't believe it. I waited all these years for this??",2016

6,"I'm still not sure how I feel about ""Legends of Tomorrow"". I liked Ray more in ""Arrow"" and the thought of these eight random rogues working together is baffling. But the more I watched the more I learned to accept the show for what it is: comic book eye candy. That's really all it is. There's occasional moments of good acting; they're rare but they happen, mainly from Garber and Miller who fit like a glove into their characters Dr. Martin Stein and Leonard Snart (Captain Cold) respectively. None of the acting is offensively bad actually. It's the writing that's the bane of the show. These characters are constantly saying and doing the stupidest possible things in any given situation. It's one thing to suspend disbelief but it helps to have a modicum of common sense to keep us grounded, which many of these characters do not.",2016
1,"Quite possibly the most pointless TV series I've ever had the misfortune of sticking with. A poor man's dr. Who gathers up some cheap rip offs of decent characters to go back in time to eliminate an immortal that killed his family so far in the future it has literally no affect on anyone recruited by him, giving them no reason to go in the first place. Armed with a ridiculous laser revolver that he somehow manages to miss every shot he takes with, this plonker bumbles through time damaging the time line more and more to the point that he ends up 3 days before his family dies taking on savage then(nullifying the entire premise of the ""show"") only to again hilariously fail! Want a tip? Don't recruit anyone, go back to a time before savage is immortal/ still a defenceless baby, carry said baby forward through time till you can find a 2x2 box for said baby to rot for all eternity, and call it a day.",2016

2,"I tried it out but I stopped maybe 4 or 5 episodes before the finale. I just couldn't take it anymore. I understand that heroes have to make bad decisions for the sake of drama, and character development, and so the show will go on, but it's just stupid, unexplained decision after stupid, unexplained decision with this one. They keep making the same mistakes over and over and giving in to emotional plot holes even after the importance of keeping the mission in mind has already been established. At this point it even seems like they are literally making combat decisions for budget reasons. 'We can't afford firestorm this week, so make sure those two get separated.' ",2016
1,"OK, I really tried with this show. I suspended disbelief for the first 2 episodes. But when you slit savages throat and he is collapsed on the floor, why not pick up the dagger he drops(the only thing that can kill him), drag his ass to the ship, lock him in chains(he has no super powers beyond living forever) and wait for Kendra(who is the only person that can kill him) to wake up and kill his ass. If all your every thought is about stopping him, wouldn't that enter your mind? I really hate the fact that the writers have watered down Arrow and The Flash to concentrate on this, and all they can do is use 70's porno music and cloths to show they are in the past. Let alone all the crappy acting everyone is doing. and I blame the directors and writers, the actors were super on every other show they were on. this is a Classic case of made a kick ass show(Arrow). Made a kick ass spin off/Original show (Flash). Now CW wants another one and there rushing to get more viewers(more money) without actually using proper writers for the specific characters. Just take the same writers we've been using ""that will work right?"" I just really hate that I can still today enjoy watching the trailer more than the actual show. With this and Supergirl, I hope this doesn't kill the comic to TV show era.",2016

1,"I first gave this show a try because it looked really interesting when I saw the first trailer.But after watching the first episode and so on,it started to feel like the writers are huge doctor who fans and justice league fans and wanted to combine the both to make the legends of tomorrow.The show has a lot of thing that resemble a lot from doctor who like the time masters are like time lords,Vandal Savage seems like the master who is the arch-enemy of the doctor,the ship the legends are on resembles the tardis if the tardis was an actual ship,Rip Hunter seems like a rip-off of the doctor and fun fact, the guy who plays as Rip Hunter actually played as an companion who's name also begins with an r.And most of the characters I used to like from other shows(White Canary,The Atom,Jax/Firestorm,Captain Cold,Heat Wave,and Green Arrow) really annoy me now.So thanks for ruining a bunch of great characters on one show The CW.This is why you(The CW) can only have a soap-opera feeling and it can influence your superhero shows also.",2017

You never know where or when it's going to come from, but this show is a hoot- as long as you don't take yourself too seriously. I suggest giving it a try- I think this show has earned it.",2017
2,"Lazy writing. The only reason I gave this a shot was because of a cross series link - 'Invasion' - part of which was The Flash, Arrow, and then this. Became aware of this in advance and thought I would need to see Legends of Tomorrow for it to make any sense. No - I didn't.",2017
3,"Simply put, the shows initial hype had me intrigued. I'm a huge fan of DC and Marvel, but if this is the best black actor they could find to portray the character the show designated as ""Firestorm"" aka Jax, DC should stop letting comics be converted by The CW, as it destroys any hope of remaining remotely true to the comics' integrity.

But that's not a bad thing really. It's just a fun series that has interesting characters with different pasts who want to become legends for different reasons and in the process grow as a character. If your looking for a 100% DC then your looking at the wrong series, but if you just wanna watch a series that is inspired by characters of DC on a fun spin off that doesn't take itself to seriously then it's worth the watch. I actually prefer this series to the flash by far, and the Arrow as well (first few seasons of the Arrow was good, then it just got weird). ",2016

The writing not only lacks any sense of direction, but it also makes every character utterly detestable.

The only bright spot in the show is that it obviously has a huge production budget and therefore the scenery and special effects are well done.",2016

Although Superman and Co. dominated the DC universe, lesser known titles like Challengers of the Unknown and Rip Hunter, Time Master generally provided a broader range of stories. The original Rip Hunter was not a time-lord style hero from the future with a band of super heroes/villains. He was a contemporary inventor whose creation, the time sphere, allowed him and several human (but not super) adventurers to travel through time. Unfortunately, the new TV show has ret-conned Rip into something else entirely. It is a fact, however, that writers at DC (and Marvel) seem to have been given carte blanche to retcon at any time to remake any character as they see fit so screw consistency.",2016

Jared Leto did his best as The Joker but had absolutely nothing to work with - he just appears at random times for a few seconds and disappears. There's no depth and no story. If you've seen the trailers, you basically saw all the one-liners and ""money shots"".",2016

I was waiting for this movie for so long, I loved Suicide Squad in Assault on Arkham and I was so happy when the news arrived about the live action movie. And as a massive Jared Leto fan I was extremely happy they chose him for the role of my all time favorite character, Joker. So I was hyped to see him, but the whole gang too. And what I got from the movie was equal with pure sadness. I mean, Jared was in it for a total 10 minutes and his role could have been easily left out, I only knew the characters because I read the comics and watched the wonderful animation (which by the way a 100 times better), the story telling was HORRIBLE, the actors could have been wonderful but they kinda lost in the terrible script. Will Smith, Margot Robbie and Viola Davis were fantastic but we didn't really get to know them... and the other characters were only there for... who know why? WHY DC, WHY? This story had so much promise and you ruined it... You should have adopted the Assault on Arkham into a live action movie... All these characters would needed a stand alone movie, and once we've got to know them then put them together... sure it would take years to build up a universe like that, but come on, that's what Marvel did and their movies are amazing! I am so, so sad right now... All of the actors deserve way better than this and they all have great potential",2016
5,This movie tries to be so much but ends up being a real mess.,2016
1,"Please, do not watch this movie at the movie theater. Not even at home. Just make a new movie in your head and pretend that this one does not exist. Trust me, whatever you imagine gets an Oscar compared to this thing.",2016
2,"The whole plot of the movie was a mess. It really confused me what all the characters in the film was fighting for, I mean there was no real goal of the movie for the first 70% of the time. Then they set up the story in a way where the friend turns into the foe, and those friends are now facing this foe as their primary enemy and not the one it was shown at the beginning of the movie. I think the whole script was written by a total non professional guy who needs to again go through the basic levels of a film school. This movie made DC lose its fame towards its fans and I hope they bounce back in their next show. Thank you",2016
3,"I was really looking forward to this movie and only ended up with a huge deception. The script is messy and there are way too many characters that are too quickly introduced. Many of these ""villains"" would require a whole movie to give intensity to their character... I really feel like DC just wanted to have as big an audience as possible without spending a penny on the script. Some good things are the special effects , the movie is overall very beautiful to watch. Some characters need a bravo for their wonderful roles: Harley Quinn mostly... The others are kind of empty to me. And some are very very bad like enchantress who mumbles in a foreign language all along and whose only 3 lines in English SUCK (when she asks Flag to destroy enchantress instead of saving her blabla). The Joker doesn't have a place in the movie, his role does not add anything to it and half of his lines are... awkward moans. El Diablo's behavior is predictable from the very beginning, Batman really wasn't necessary, Katana's few lines are desperately cheesy, etc... As a conclusion, the viewer is unable to feel a link whatsoever to any of the characters since their stories are disappointingly and quickly told. The acting of many characters does not help, whether they were just bad or the director asked them to play in that un-subtle fashion. The script is disjoint, flashbacks don't add much quality or intensity to the movie, and the ""big plot"" revealed at the end is... not much of a secret since the viewer KNOWS enchantress escaped from the hands of Waller. I feel like this is a big commercial move from DC to attract people... However, this will only disgust the people who were fans of the heroes/villains in the beginning. Money over quality",2016
6,"Suicide Squad was a disappointment to me. May be I got hooked on the hype or was expecting too much from WB. This movie had a great concept that we saw on the small screen, both TV series and animated. For some reason, those formats did it better than this theatrical release. ",2016
1,"If you want to enjoy this do not ask logical questions. Of course if I wanted a documentary movie , but logical inconsistencies here are too much...",2016
1,"Where to start, where to start? This is probably the main problem of the DCU at the moment. They're playing catchup to Marvel, they see Avengers they want in. The problem is, Marvel have spent 4,5 & 6 movies setting it up. We care if Cap gets hurt, we understand the Hulks turmoil and we saw Starks motivation for donning the suit. But here we're introduced to a whole new cast, backstory and all, in 30 mins tops. It just doesn't work, it's rushed, it's lazy and it has no effect in making the audience care about these characters; which in a movie where the stakes are so high, does not bode well. So here's what I thought of each character:",2016
1,"After sitting in the theater, about 30 minutes into the movie, i asked myself: ""Why the hell did this pile of vomit make it to the big screen? Why did I pay full price for this straight to DVD shoot-em-up fest?, why do I like that deranged blonde so much?"". ",2016
1,"Talk about corny jokes, this movie is full of them. The story is so predictable and the characters are not good at all. Will Smith as Deadshot, bad, Harley Quinn, annoying, Killer Croc unbelievable, boomerang dumb, Joker just ridiculous.",2016
1,Where to start...woe is me...where to start?!?! First I'll say I was looking forward to this movie for a long time..like many people. All I really cared about was of course...the resurrection of The Joker!,2016
1,Suicide Squad is a tedious movie. I saw this last night and I've tried to forget it ever since. ,2016
1,"Just awful -horrible dialogue, zero premise. Stereotype Squad as far as characters concerned...in particular the Asian 'character' which was obviously a laughably cynical afterthought and the Boomerang Joe or Pete (I didn't care) - I mean, come on! Will Smith seemed embarrassed or wincing delivering his lines -hard to tell -and as for Jared Leto's OTT indulgent 'acting' -sheesh. Margot Robbie was probably only one whose character had a few good lines. Sad to see the otherwise incredible actress from Secrets and Lies reduced to the ridiculous boss character. The CGI was awful, particularly the monster at the end. Didn't make me feel anything toward the characters -no emotional resonance whatsoever.",2016
2,For the budget and start power... This was a total waste of time.,2016
1,"OK.So I'm a senior.But I've seen lots of Marvel/DC Comics movies. I really liked Ant Man last year because there was a story to it.Suicide Squad was filmed in my home town, Toronto.There was so much hype.But even my grown son hated it when we saw it.There's no character development. We wasted our money.Don't go to this disaster. You'll regret it no matter your age.During each scene, I was wondering what is happening.Because the lighting was so dark,I couldn't make out the action. There were times I kept asking myself why I had agreed to come to this film. The character,Harley Quinn, had this Brooklyn accent which didn't really fit in. The joker was a joke,not even scary or comical.This was the worst movie I have seen this year.",2016
4,"To start it off, i'm a big fan of dc cinematic universe, and the year 2016, hadn't been a good year for me and the other fans. Even though, i'll state myself optimistic, since actually, all my hopes and expectation fall into this movie instead. ",2016
8,"I personally think that Suicide squad is a great movie to introduce justice league. The presence of flash and batman helps the viewer to understand justice league plot and explain what really happen when they lost superman in batman vs superman saga. Will smith's role is quite astonishing and I consider his role as alive. Amanda walker is so mean. Captain boomerang is a little bit wooden. The quality of the humors was fantastic. I enjoyed them so much. I think SC should have notable villain (bad guy) character. Personally I think Enchantress shouldn't be the villain. She didn't really portray the ""bad side"" of the movie. The main reason why Enchantress turns against Amanda is because she threatens her. She is not the bad side, Amanda is. It will be cool if Joker be the villain instead (lol). I love the new joker. Simplicity and elegant combined. He is totally will be the bad ass during the next DC movie. Can't wait to watch him. The flashbacks to introduce all the character were great. Simple and straight to the point. SC is able to show the good side of Harley despite she is totally the bad villain. Joker's helicopter accident was a great plot twist. In terms of general plot, I still didn't see the connection between SC and dark knight rises and the previous DC movies. I hope the next DC movie can provide the viewers with the connections",2016
10,"I really don't get it, and to be honest I don't think it's fair for the people who have worked on this movie at all. My friend and I watched the Suicide Squad in the cinema, and we had a great time!",2016
1,"Awful direction and screen writing. This movie is plagued with awkward and anticlimactic scenes. Seriously, can this David Ayer suck less?",2016
10,"The Crown boasts no action sequences or big movie stars, and yet it is one of the most expensive shows of all time. Why? Because of the sheer attention to detail. Aside from the fully historically accurate costumes and locations, the show is just gorgeous to look at. The lighting, the cinematography, and everything else visual about it is on point. It's quite apparent none of that money went to waste.",2016
10,"What an extraordinary treat. It was like reading a truly engrossing book. I couldn't wait for the next chapter because even if I knew the story, the personal details enlarged and, somehow, penetrates the mystery that this, one of the most public families in the world, hide behind the surface. I found myself rewinding to see the scenes of Eileen Atkins as Queen Mary. She brought a humanity to the character that I never even imagined but that it makes total sense. John Lithgow is terrific as Winston Churchill. I had a powerful memory of Albert Finney as Churchill in ""The Gathering Storm"" but I guess most great actors will play their own version of the man. Next is Gary Oldman in ""Darkest Hour"". Clarie Foy is sheer perfection as the young Queen Elizabeth but it is Matt Smith that blew me away with his Prince Philip because I realized I never thought of Prince Philip other than as the imposing figure behind the Queen. Matt Smith explains that figure and gives him a complexity and a humanity that will make me look at Prince Philip in an entirely new light from now on. So, thank you. I'm starting Season 2, today.",2017
10,"I just watched the first two episodes and I already am in love with the story and characters! The acting is excellent as well as the directing, story line, costumes, sets, filming locations and everything else that has gone into the making of this series. It is well written and filmed and I am looking forward to seeing the remaining episodes. I have always been fascinated with history and this series takes you back in time. It has such powerful emotion and a lot of surprises which held my interest tremendously. So far, the episodes I saw went by quickly with me wanting to see more. If you are a history buff or interested in the Royal Family, don't miss this! It is a down to earth version of their lives and responsibilities. And so far, there are many things I did not know or appreciate. Definitely a learning experience and thank you for such a beautiful story! This is an addition to my previous post- I am now on episode 9 and if there aren't any awards for acting, I will be extremely surprised. John Lithgow's portrayal of Winston Churchill is award winning as well as Claire Foy playing the Queen. All of the acting is superb in my opinion and I don't want this series to end...",2016
10,Where to start is very difficult when it comes to what I can only describe as an amazing feat of production and acting. The cast are absolutely outstanding and are nothing but professional.,2016
10,"Regardless of what you may think of the Royals Netflix has poured a ton of money into this exquisite production about the life of Queen Elizabeth. It is a show which requires fixed attention as things progress at a unhurried pace. The opening musical evolution is enchanting and never grows old. Actress Claire Foy is beautifully riveting in the role of Elizabeth; someone who wants to have a normal life and yet is made to feel her duty as Queen should be the highest priority. It has been suggested the Queen is warm, has a sense of humor, is compassionate and this portrayal conveys it. She is wise enough to realize she's going to have to forge her own way as those around her are stymied in their own limitations or ignorance. John Lithgow transforms into Winston Churchill and is equally stellar. Their scenes together are superb. If Peter Morgan's research is accurate I can fully appreciate how Princess Diana must have felt. The show is rounded out by a wonderful supporting cast. This show is my favorite Netflix production so far.",2016
10,"To be very honest, when a friend told me we should watch the crown, a series about Queen Elizabeth ll life, i was not excited, im normally not a very good person to start watching a new series. However, so glad i watched this. Me and my friend watched 3 episodes, and i watched the rest on my own, latter that day. ",2016
10,"Every so often a drama comes along that takes away your breath. Sometimes that's subjective, other times objective. Dramas such as The Jewel in the Crown, The West Wing, Game of Thrones, House of Cards, Downton Abbey, House M.D. have all stood at the pinnacle of television drama.",2016
9,"The Crown is one of the fascinating dramas I have watched in very recent of times. First off, the show itself is a bit slow paced but nevertheless, it generates enough amount of suspense over the episodes. The Crown may lack the twist and turning of events than many other historical dramas, but the flawless direction and impeccable acting of its actors do not allow its audiences get disappointed. Secondly, the grandeur of the show is something of a treat to the sore eyes. Netflix has not been so frugal in the making of the show and it has paid them off every penny. The costume and the furnishing of the show within are scintillating. Lastly, this show is a great history lesson for all the viewers, particularly the ones who are of younger generations. It is mostly based on true events, so that is indeed a stand-out fact of the show. Though there were some moments where it seemed a little bit exaggerated but considering its genre as a TV series, that is reasonable. The Crown has allowed its viewers to peek what lies behind the royal curtains and taught a significant truth that a royal born doesn't necessarily get to evade all the personal tribulations that all the other commoners go through. They share just as same values as the other citizens of the country.",2016
10,I dipped into the first episode of this and found myself losing an entire weekend binge-watching the whole series.,2016
10,"The Crown is almost one of the best period movies ( or better say, series of movies ) ever made. It defines the quality of historic period film making with every aspect. The casting is superior, the cinematography is outstanding, the thoughtfully written script just fixes you to the chair and you cannot stop yourself for several hours to watch it through. I personally watched it all twice to digest all the details prepared for the audience. I must admit The Crown easily made me a Netflix fan & a paid member after a quick glimpse at the trailer. A fortune is spent but worth every penny. Thanks to the producers, the amazing directors and the wonderful cast.",2016
9,"Taking place in the 20th century, 1947 to be precise. King George VI is coughing up blood and is drawing his last breath. Mean while Queen Elizabeth is to be wed to Philip Mountbatten. When she is blindsided by George's demise. She's left in awe, as she has no education to lead her people. As her ascension was not predicted to happen in the near future. Realizing the predicament she is in. She struggles to keep her people in line while trying to comprehend the overwhelming responsibilities she must bare. With the weight of her country on her shoulders she must knuckle down and take a step forward to embrace her influence. Produced by Peter Morgan, who is know for penning the overzealous ""The Queen(2006)"". You can tell that no expense was spared, as the series has an estimated budget of one hundred million pounds, the show enraptures you with it's glorious visuals and stupendous costumes. ",2016
9,"Plot summary: A shy young woman, descended from a long line of hardworking German immigrants, doesn't feel quite ready to take over the family business. ",2016
10,"This is without a doubt one of the best series ever on television. So brilliantly conceived, produced, cast, directed and written that it's hard to find words to express my utter amazement. The episodes are well thought out and written with amazing detail to time and place, and crafted in such away to artfully but truthfully tell the viewer what she needs to know without becoming overly bogged down by details or excessive drama. Claire Foy makes a powerful impression as Elizabeth: from shy newlywed to deer-in-the-headlight after her father's unexpected death,and finally to cool and confident monarch committed to doing what she must, even at a personal cost. Matt Smith's performance as the often tactless, very plain speaking but always well meaning Prince Philip, the most forward thinking family member at the time, is terrific. But far and away, Jared Harris' understated George the VI will no doubt be considered legendary. He captures the essence of that King: a fragile, gentle soul who was thrust into a role he never wanted and for which he had no preparation, but somehow managing to do a fine job despite the odds. If the scene at the Sandringham Christmas party doesn't move you, you have no heart. So sit back and be transported to another time and place. You'll probably end up binge watching this masterpiece. I can't wait for Season 2. Kudos to Netflix for lavishly funding this production.",2016
8,"The Crown is certainly a beautiful drama. There was no expense spared in replicating some iconic scenes. But from the first episode onward, there are some significant historic inaccuracies that detract from the production.",2016

9,"I am not a royalist by any means. In fact, I often wonder why kings and queens exist in the 21st century. I marvel that they don't come to their senses themselves and join the human race as it is. So, I did balk at watching this Netflix offering at first.",2016
10,"Bravo! Our obsession with all things regal and statecraft is celebrated by this finest shining achievement which is a most in-depth series dramatizing the burdens associated with having flesh and blood constitution beneath the almighty weight of the British crown; family ties, bureaucratic entanglements, the intricacies of regal obligations to the state and the many different peoples of many different countries within the Commonwealth, and the difficulties of remaining personally separate, differentiated, and completely silent about how difficult it all is to manage well, or if it can even be managed at all. And... more interestingly... what really happens when it all gets mucked up and goes sideways. Season One available and streaming in-full and entirely without interruptions right now at Netflix.com",2016
1,"Is there anything more loathsome and irresponsible than a movie or TV series that turns history into a soap opera? How dare people reinterpret history as entertainment. Why, oh why do people see the need to twist history into melodrama in which the only ""truth"" we truly see is the writer's ego. This series is not about ""The Crown"", or Queen Elizabeth, it is about Peter Morgan. There is only one way to do justice to history and that is as a documentary. Yes, I know that may not be the blockbuster ""spectacle"" the masses want to see, but it is the truth. If you want to make costume dramas and visual feasts, do it on something like Downton Abbey where history is not part of the collateral damage. Superficially ""The Crown"" ticks off the main ""historical"" events, such they were. There was a Coronation. There was a scandal involving Princess Margaret and Peter Townsend. There was a great smog in London in 1952 in which thousands of people died. In that sense ""The Crown"" may indeed be ""historically accurate"". But to use these incidents as backdrops to paint totally hypothetical pictures of individuals, to literally make up dialogue people never spoke, to give them personalities that are pure speculation, to generate events that never happened, to blow out of all proportion events that did happen, simply to create the crises of each episode, is just unforgivable. If I wander down to my local library I will find a wall of books labelled ""Biographies"". In this wall I will find books that contain all that is known on a particular person. If dialogue is included it will be in quotes, and often have a reference, so the reader knows what was actually said. The author does not generally make up dialogue or create fiction just to spice it up a bit, or if they do it is quite clear it is the author's own views. This is what we call truth, and actually, as been noted many times, truth is often more interesting than fiction. If one were to try and publish a ""book"" version of this screenplay any prospective publisher would fall on the floor laughing. If perchance one was stupid enough to actually publish it it would end up in the ""Fiction"" section, filed under ""P"" for ""Potboiler"", just along from the Mills and Boons. Peter Morgan is evidently an extremely gifted person but seemingly an enigma. On the one hand he can write some truly breathtaking ""dialog"" when that dialog is impersonal, that is, it is expressing universal truths that really have nothing to do with the character. Then in the next breath we stoop to abysmal depths of ridiculousness/crassness ‚Äì such as brave Prince Philip fighting off elephants, brainy Prince Philip telling his minions to put in a bigger fuse in his intercom system (who knew he was an electrical engineer?), and most heinously of all, inserting a ridiculous and entirely unnecessary character called Venitia Scott. Bath water coming under Winston Churchill's door? Give me a break. Mercifully this character gets hit by a bus fairly smartly ‚Äì what a shame more of the cast did not share the same fate. If I can loosely paraphrase a famous quote from Winston Churchill (you will have to provide your own accents and cigars for this)....""Never in the course of human conflict, has so much money, been spent by so few, for so little good"".",2016
2,Much like the 1990's film TITANIC...Hollywood has lavished high production values to THE CROWN but little else. Any connection to history is non-existent and quite alarming.,2017
9,"If you are looking for a fantastic historical drama about what it means to be a (British) royal, look no further than The Crown. But be warned: if you are looking for a series that gushes over the royal family, I implore you to look elsewhere, for this is not that show. Whilst being a royal looks glamorous on the outside, it is quite a different story behind the glitz. I will just say this: prior to watching The Crown, I was a supporter of the British monarchy; now, not so much.",2016
3,Are you people crazy? What on earth is appealing about this show? My god is it slow! So incredibly slow. I watched 2 eps and seriously how are people giving this 9/10?,2016
10,"First, I would like to correlate this drama with a movie The King's Speech, it won Oscars. Then comes this drama - simple and elegant, which proves to be almost elaborated sequel of that. I become fan of Peter Morgan who tells us how to present an ordinary real story in an extra-ordinary manner. It shows the real challenges of the young Queen Elizabeth amid the fast changing British society and male chauvinist husband; despite all, she stands firm and finally, the crown wins. People during her rule has advantage of experiencing new form of sovereignty which also redresses parliamentary democracy. All these things are portrayed in the magnificent way. A must watch show for the people who like British English and I have enjoyed it a lot!",2017
1,"The Crown presents Her Majesty the Queen as imperious, rather than regal. She frequently looks like a snotty, po-faced upper-crust miss, spoilt beyond belief. In life, I don't think that anyone has EVER regarded the Queen in that manner. I suppose that playing a woman who was genuinely beautiful, genuinely regal and had a wonderful quality of deep serenity and composure about her is not an easy ask. But the composure that was present on her 21st birthday, when she made her memorable speech, pledging herself to a life of service for her people, and the extraordinary grace and courage with which she descended from the aeroplane after the death of her father, to greet the waiting dignitaries are the keys to the reality of Elizabeth. ",2017
8,"I love this show. It's a feel good comedy that's lighthearted and will make you laugh while still trying to get some good life lessons across. You also don't need to search to find the deeper meaning in the show, its made blatantly obvious, but its not heavy. ",2016
9,"I thought this would be boring, but watched the pilot... then the second episode... then the third... fourth... fifth... sixth... seventh... and came full-stop only because those are the only episodes I could watch now On Demand.",2016
9,"Honestly, this show is fun. That's the bottom line for it. I have watched the first eight episodes so far, and it's not the funniest or most clever TV I have every watched, but it was fun to view. It's bright, has fun set pieces, and the characters are all great. Kristen Bell and Ted Danson both play their parts beautifully, and are a pleasure to watch perform. One of the most fun aspects of the show is slowly having the rules of ""The Good Place"" revealed to you as you watch. I hope this show isn't cancelled, because I would be sorely disappointed if I didn't get to keep learning how this world operates. If you haven't yet tried out ""The Good Place"" it is well worth a shot.",2016
10,"I'm only 4 episodes in, but it's already my favorite comedy on television right now.",2016
8,"First off, I have loved Kristen Bell's work ever since the late, lamented Veronica Mars series. Like Buffy, she is the perky blonde who saves the world. And perhaps in this series, she will have to do the same - literally! The whole ""look and feel"" reminds me very much of Pushing Daisies - the saturated colours, the segues into absurdity, even the life-after-death motifs. And that's not a bad thing - Daisies was one of my top favourite shows.",2016
10,"I only started watching it for Kristen Bell, but it quickly became my favorite TV show. I couldn't spoil this even if I wanted to. You really have to watch it for yourself. Every episode left me going, ""Wait, what?! How can you stop it there??"" and the final episode of the season literally made me scream ""WHAT THE FORK?!"" Ignore the reviews of anyone who hasn't seen every episode yet. Trust me when I say, you have no idea what you're watching until that last episode. Then, you'll likely have to re-watch it (like I am right now) to see it in a whole new light.",2017

9,"...an Existentialist play written in 1944, who'da thunk?",2018
10,"This is so well written and not just another pointless, off-the-shelf sitcom. The acting and writing go hand in hand with the actors being cast so well and pulling off their characters perfectly. The characters all play off each other every episode and not just one with one and another with another, the whole cast interacts which you don't always get in sitcoms these days.
This may be considered a spoiler but it isn't specific it just outlines a general thing that happens.
The twist that happens in one episode was, for me, completely unpredictable and even after it the caliber of the programme only improves. It doesn't lose momentum or run out of ideas. Very well done to all involved and you should definitely watch this show. I really can't find fault with it.",2018
10,"What if the afterlife was a sitcom ?
It is quite a great premise, and it lends it self well to creative visual gags and clever jokes, and the script in general is pretty well written. I love Kristen Bell's performance and her snappy, witty dialog. It's really fun and I laughed quite a few times. Also Ted Danson is pretty great.
It's just a fun, feel good, comedy.
Highly recommended, 10 points.",2018

(5) Kristen Bell is a forking revelation. (6) Ted Danson rocks.",2016
8,"This looks like it could be a very good show! The pilot episodes were promising and quite funny. Kristen Bell is a selfish and shallow person who accidentally gets to the good place in afterlife. Ted Danson is the guy who runs one section of this heavenly place which he also designed. Everything is tailored perfectly for the good people who live there and there is perfect harmony, i.e. that is until Kristen's character arrives and starts disrupting the balance. Overall, after a two episode pilot we can conclude that the premise of the show is promising, humor is sharp and politically incorrect, the actors are well cast and there is much room for further development and improvement.",2016

Although I liked Kristen Bell in Veronica Mars and have enjoyed her in other shows and movies, I wasn't sure if she would be able to pull off being the lead character. Wow was I surprised at how funny and likable her character is despite the fact that on earth she wasn't a very good person. I'm very intrigued to discover the mystery behind the mistake that led to her arrival in the Good Place. I thought all the characters were great and acting was top notch. I must also share that it is so refreshing having a unique television show on the air that isn't about cops, or lawyers, or crime scene investigators.",2016
10,"It's one of the greatest TV shows in television! We have stunning performances of all the actors, with a special consideration for Janet, which for me it's one of the best things of the show! The show takes a simple and boring headline and transforms it into magical thing. It's not a mouse trap comedy, in which we only see a happening, we get really involved with Eleanor's story! The show contains really great plot twists, they make you hope for a character that's supposedly bad! The show innovates and surprises! What most catches me about this show is: the delightful comedy, which doesn't force a joke or a situation; An amazing story, the writing of the show makes what looked for me a bad idea into a innovative story; Amazing acting from the entire cast. The show makes you have some laughs while you question deep philosopical and ethical problems in your society.",2016
9,"I am sick and tired of movies and shows with unnecessary nudity and cussing. The theme of the show is quite brilliant. I love the fact that they show actual dumb things of the world as dumb things and mock the bad things. They embrace the good things of the world as good things. This show is clean, fun, and not cheesy. There should be more shows like this. This is like clean, tasty, and healthy food among filthy dumpster. Please check this show out!",2017
9,"To me, in this first chapter, I found what might be a fun series, original in its approach, and in which the performance of his main character, Kristen Bell, is very remarkable, giving much credence to his character. We will have to wait for new chapters to see if you follow this original way and delights us with moments of humor and dialogues chisposos.",2016
10,"I already love everything Kristen Bell does so I am bias, but this show is awesome!!! I cannot get enough. I wish it was longer than 1/2 hour per episode. I bought it on #amazonprime right away so I wouldn't miss an episode. Other reviewers are comparing it to some other shows which I have not seen. I have never seen anything quite like this - it's sweet and funny and wholesome, so appropriate for all age levels - which also is part of why I'm surprised by how much I got into it and so quickly. It really only took 2 episodes and I was hooked. I cannot believe season 1 went by so fast. Plus I was super shocked by the twist in the last episode of S1 - When is season 2???? don't know if I can wait that long!!! I wish they sold full streaming seasons before they aired - even if I had to pay extra I'd buy them!",2017
10,This show starts off kind of corny but by the time the first season is close to over it's so addictive and truly wonderful. The plot twists are mind bending. ,2018
5,I'll leave this review fairly concise. ,2016
9,10 Cloverfield Lane gives all the development and the meaningful story that its blood relative installment lacked completely. This is not a spectacle full of screams and special effects. This is a spectacle of tension and suspense of epic proportions. This is a really feel-bad movie at certain points.,2016
5,"I give the 5/10 out of the credit I owe to the original writers of the fascinating psychological horror that takes place inside the bunker. The mystery is compelling: Is Howard telling the truth? Is there any real threat outside? Is Howard a crazy child-abusing maniac? Did he plan all this to own Michelle? etc. I could all go on pretty well had the film ended with the heroine's escape, but then, all of a sudden, what the? REAL ALIENS? Are you kidding me? Just how ""lost"" are you Mr. Abrams?! You turned the fantastic, gripping thriller about a deranged paranoid old man into a totally irrelevant tale of worm aliens taking over the earth? The ending ruins everything. The character of Michelle was well portrayed as a woman running away from problems instead of facing them, finally managing to ""grow up"" and learn to fight her problems. The ending, however, turns her into a completely different person. From a timid girlfriend, Michelle turns into an alien- smacking badass chick straight out of a classic sci-fi alien flick who blows up a giant alien invader with a bottle of liquor and a matchbox and, not frightened in the least, decides to take the fight to the aliens herself. The movie begins and proceeds as a psychological thriller/drama about paranoia, claustrophobia, and insanity and in a split second turns into the worst moments of the Resident Evil franchise. I literally thought I was watching a remake of the ending of The Thing, with the same actress and all. Great job uncle J.J., you did it again. Had I know he was involved in the plot, I would've thought twice before watching this film. You CAN enjoy this film, just turn if off as soon as the hero goes free. keep watching and it'll turn all the fun you had into utter disappointment, frustration, and resentment.",2017
5,"First of all, I must say that I was expecting 'something different' considering the 7.3 note here! Something really worth of that note, but this is not that great!",2016
8,"Full disclosure: The year is 2007. A trailer hits cinema screens advertising a mysterious film named ""Cloverfield."" Nobody knows what it's about, except that it's riding on the wave of the found footage genre, and that it seems to depict a giant monster attack on New York. Speculation immediately breaks out all over the internet, but nowhere more fiercely than on the IMDb forums, with many folks being caught up in the genius viral marketing. I myself was one of those people, along with my wife. Yes, we met on IMDb's Cloverfield forum. She moved from the US to Australia a few years after, we got married, and we've lived together happily ever since.",2016
9,"If this is going to be an anthology or if this is going to be followed by that rumored third installment that has been recently spoiled by J.J. Abrahms, I can say that nobody doubts about the secretly marketed ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is a great movie on its own. And a movie that if it were spoiled by someone here or at any review would be cruel.",2016
7,I've always loved movies with strong atmosphere. Three people locked together in an underground shelter is a recipe for making a movie which is going to draw you in a rather small but peculiar world.,2016
6,"(Fave movie-quote) - ""You don't know what's out there!"" ",2016
9,"First of all, if you want to watch '10 Cloverfield Lane', make sure to avoid any kind of spoilers on the internet. I will try to write this review without spoilers, even if it's a bit difficult considering the movie I just witnessed.",2016
7,To describe 10 Cloverfield Lane in one word: Genreless.,2016
1,I never write reviews. ever. This is probably my first EVER.,2016
10,It isn't very often that you can go see a movie at the theater and not have the slightest idea of where it'll take you. Even more rare is when a movie like that delivers a wholly original story that's even more satisfying than you ever thought it would be.,2016
1,I loved Cloverfield which for me was one of the best films of the 21st Century. I saw it in a cinema and loved it and watched it a dozen times since on DVD and still love it. ,2016
1,Awful does not even begin to describe this mess of a movie. I am absolutely gobsmacked by all the positive reviews here and on rotten tomatoes.....Or maybe I live in an alternate universe? This is right up there with overrated movies like Gravity and Inception.,2016
1,"Goodman plays Howard, a paranoid psychopath and the proprietor of a large underground hideout, built for the occasion. In said hideout, he plays house to two co-dwellers: a bearded moron (John Gallagher Jr) and an attractive young lady played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Is there really a threat outside, will Howard behave himself? The problem is, after 20 minutes of tedious scenario and bland characters, who really cares?",2016
1,"So, I watched the first one knowing nothing about it and walked out of the theater with even less knowledge of what it was supposed to be about. This one is exactly the same. I didn't put 2 + 2 together about this movie being a sequel (kinda) to the other one. Had I known that, I would not have wasted my money.",2016
1,May contain spoilers so read at your own risk.,2016
1,"Is this a thriller,science fiction or violence movie??Not able to understand the characters,the director's presentation of the movie or what he's able to say.The movie starts as a normal one with the first 10 minutes,then suddenly an accident happens and the actress suddenly is seen tied in a underground bunker.After about half an hour the heroine just changes her captive's house as her own and suddenly in the end it changes into a zombie and science fiction movie.Just cant understand the movie,,who the characters are and what the director wants to say to the audience.Pls make good movies which satisfies the viewers at least to a fair and believable extent.",2016
1,"How much did the producer pay the critics on rotten tomato to write positive reviews? This movie was EXTREMELY BORING up until the last maybe 5 minutes. It starts as a crazed doomsday prepper finally getting his wish and using his bunker, but with a twist he's a crazed murder. He kills off the guy, we find out he kidnapped a girl, and the main girl escapes only to find aliens polluting the world with a flammable gas. She kills it with a bottle of whiskey, lighting it on fire. It ends with her going to Huston to help save others. Very boring. I would have rather had a movie on the old man and him with the kidnapped girl. I just want to know where I could request to get my money back. Terrible.",2016
8,"First of all, the film was more than good, in my opinion and, for the people who like to see a good or more than good movie, I recommend buying a ticket or the DVD release or just rent it. As a medium spoiler, I'd say that, plot wise, it reminded me of ""Law abiding citizen"", with the first three quarters of the movie full of suspense and plot twists, and the last act, a little rushed and over the top. And that justifies the two penalty points I gave to this movie, one of them just for the exaggerated use of a bottle of good brandy.",2016
9,"The first thing I'll say is that I'm not going to spoil a single thing about this film (other than how good it is), because everyone deserves the chance to see this film as I did - without a clue to the answer of the mystery and simply looking for any shred of evidence to guide my opinion. I actually had very little idea what kind of a film I was in for with '10 Cloverfield Lane'. I had seen 'Cloverfield' years back and mildly enjoyed it (according to the rating I gave it on IMDb) but could remember very little of it. I knew what the plot was about and that it was a ""found footage"" film but could remember almost zero specifics. I can tell you though that I won't be forgetting specifics about this sequel for a very long time.",2016
9,"Boy did i have doubts about this. The trailers certainly made me more optimistic, but I still put off watching the first episode when it came out because i really didn't know what to expect.",2016
10,"No spoilers - but the TV show played like a big Hollywood production. When I discovered McG was directing and producing the show (at the opening credits), my expectations went up considerably. ",2016
9,This series really surprised me. It has been a long time since I looked forward to watching a show as much as this one every week. It reminds me of many good 80s cop or detective shows. No one has been able to equal the buddy cop or detective show formula of the 80s until now. Very well done indeed.,2017
9,"I watched the first episode fully prepared to be disappointed, but wow, these guys really pulled it off! I actually think if it continues to be this good, I will like this better than the original movies. It's that good. And, I am not your ""typical"" action-cop watcher...just an old lady who would never like this series just for the guts and glory. The chemistry between the characters was evident from the get-go...and I mean all the characters not just the 2 leading men. The writing is really good and solid. If the rest of the episodes just remain on par with the first one, it will be a good show. If they get better and better, it will be a GREAT series. Here's hoping!",2016
8,"It's really hard to talk about Lethal Weapon without thinking about Danny Glover saying ""i'm too old for this ****"", Mel Gibson pointing a gun to his head every time he can and Michael Kamen composing those amazing soundtracks that make you feel the pain of Martins Riggs.",2016
9,This is a great show that's lots of fun to watch! I look forward to it each week.,2016
9,"I'm always hesitant to view remakes of things I've liked in the past, but this one is an 'all thumbs up'. I became familiar with Clayne Crawford in 'Rectify' where he played a sane, but vile, version of Martin Riggs. I was a bit apprehensive about him playing Martin Riggs, the insane version. But it works GREAT!!!! He plays the character wonderfully!! The partnership of Damon and Clayne is an excellent combo. I love this show. It's like a mini movie every Wednesday night. I'm glad to see the number of episodes was increased. Finally!!! Something to watch on hump day Wednesdays that gets your blood pumping and your laughter flowing. I hope there is a season two.",2016
10,"I gave it a chance just because. I expected to hate the show on account of that chemistry can never be duplicated. Well, turns out they did an amazing job of it. The second half of Season 1 is WAY stronger than the first half, and by episode 15 they are truly hitting it out of the park. ",2017
9,"I thought ""how can they make this""",2016
8,Daman Wayans and Clayne Crawford have taken on two of the most beloved movie characters of the past 30 years and have managed to both reverentially nod to the past whilst claiming this ground as their own.,2016
8,Being a HUGE fan of the Lethal Weapon movies and having seen them uncountable times I was a bit apprehensive about this show and therefore didn't start watching it until I had accumulated 5 episodes.,2016
10,"Damon Wayans and Clayne Crawford are an excellent team! I was expecting to see their dynamic energy fizzle. It doesn't. Instead, it pulls me into their story to the point the reality at the Murtaugh dinner table makes me want to get up and make dinner. The sound and set lighting are interesting the way they interact, weave the light to grainy almost sometimes too dark. Enter not only interaction family funny side, there's an adorable baby! The chase, and shoot out scenes aren't over done like other cop shows. There are a lot of other programs in the same day and time slot impacting viewer totals. Given a chance, I see ""Lethal Weapon"" going the distance because its feels real with real people. Great casting. Good story. There is good balance between heavy and light in the air as well as in the heart.",2016
10,"After watching the trailer for this show, I was worried. Thought it would be cheesy and overdone but this ended up being one of my favorite shows at the moment. ",2016
9,"Hello all, I'm 38 and I have a deep love of the lethal weapon movies, when I saw this series was airing I thought their going to struggle to fill them boots but was intrigued enough to have a look. To be honest after the first episode I thought nope what have they done, but I still tuned in for the next and the next and now only six episodes in i'm thoroughly enjoying the series. I'm beginning to love the Murtaugh family (More so than the movies) and it makes a refreshing change from all the slapstick or over analytical cop shows on the telly. If they had dropped the names and let the public make the comparisons they would probably have a hit on their hands. As far as I'm concerned it's a big thumbs up and I hope they carry on and build on the series as I think it has lots of potential ""Mel who"", ""Danny what""?",2016
9,"I fell in love with this series against my will. I started watching it because I had nothing else to do. I thought it would be complete and utter ... well ... yeah. It wasn't. Because the two protagonist work together ever so well, there's no other cop-series I know that can compare to this.",2017
8,Lethal weapon This is my very humble opinion about this series,2017
8,It has been a while since I watched a remake or a new TV show that did not suck big time.,2016
10,"It's been nearly thirty years since the ""Lethal Weapon"" film paired Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in one of the best buddy cop films of all time. The pilot of this television adaptation follows the story of the original film very closely.",2016
9,It is one of the ONLY shows I truly look forward to watching each week. ,2017
9,I started watching this show as a bit of a 'throw away' title.. I loved the films but nowhere near as much as I love this show/reboot of the story and characters.,2016
9,"I liked the lethal weapon movies very much. I have them on DVD. I was very curious about this show. and I'm sold from the first episode. It's a fun show, based on the movies. The episodes and story lines are well put together. Great actors, they play their parts very well. I did liked the character of martin Riggs in the movies and it is also my favorite character in this TV show played by clayne Crawford. But also Damon wayans is doing a good job and offcourse the other actors(they all make this show so good). There is a good chemistry and that gives the show a very good vibe. It's a good mix of humor, action and drama. It's hard to get good humor in TV show like this, And to combine it, but they did it. I can't wait to see the next episode, and i hope more will follow.",2016
10,"First of all, I'm a real fan of Gibson and Lethal Weapon movie series. I say this because there are many people that won't give a chance to this show because of the opinion ""it will never be like movie"". No, it won't. But, in it's own way, this show is really good. Actually, I've surprised myself with incredible hype for this series. So, PLEASE, before you go on saying 'Gibson and Glover are legends, this is crap', give these guys a chance, you will not regret it. And I agree, Danny and Mel are real movie legends, but Clayne and Damon are doing one hell of a good job out there. Now, why 9 out of 10 then? Because I think show needs to get a little cut on some cheesy moments (yes, there are some) and to explore a little bit more that darkness in their minds (talking especially about Riggs). First movie from '87 had that line of madness mixed with severity and I'm hundred percent convinced that Crawford and Wayans can act the hell out of it. Continue with the good work!",2017
10,I honestly didn't expect much from this show.....but boy was I wrong !!!!! It is sooooooooooooooo well written and has such a great combination of humor seriousness and awesome crime mysteries!! I love it....it is definitely one of my favorite shows right now and I hope they keep renewing season after season. Damon wayans and clay be Crawford are an excellent team . Riggs and Murtaug are their character names and they're such a good combo of chill and level headed and crazy with brotherly love! Riggs wife had passed away as a premise of the show and it also has this sentimental component. But definitely the crimes for each episode are interesting and intriguing !! Definitely does not lack any comedy ....like I said before it is completely well written!! I highly recommend this show for people who loved the lethal weapon movie and people who love binge watching crime series!!,2017
8,"The TV landscape is littered with spin-offs that failed to capture the ratings, success and adulation that their motion picture parents enjoyed (Ferris Bueller and Delta House anyone?). But some succeed...M*A*S*H, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Friday Night Lights, and Parenthood (the second attempt).",2017
9,"As many sci-fi fans will know, the show 'Westworld' is based on the 1973 feature film of the same name (written and directed by Michael Crichton), and the premise is basically the same as it was then: In a future where technological possibilities are seemingly endless, a highly sophisticated theme park offers rich clients the chance to visit the long gone era of the Old West (Crichton later explored a variation of that theme in a certain well known novel - which was then adapted by a certain Mr. Spielberg - albeit with slightly different creatures than cowboys populating a slightly more ""jurassic"" environment).",2016
10,"Pay attention, this series explores some very subtle story lines. I was extremely impressed when they introduced the bicameral mind concept when considering consciousness. That is one of the more important concepts when considering the origins of consciousness. I hope they explore this idea in greater detail and especially its implications related to physics. It is rare indeed to have a fictional work undertake such a complex topic without trivializing it. I definitely have to compliment the writers for undertaking such a complex topic and I hope they continue to explore the implications.",2016
10,"This show is so far perfect. The story is intriguing, the visuals are beautiful and the acting is incredible.",2016
10,"First of all, it is very clear that the production mindset behind Westworld is far from creating a cheap product with generic high bursts of tension/love/horror/excitement. It is full of deep human conflicts, that is if you are open to watch it with a clear mind.",2016
10,"Wow, where to begin...",2016
9,Westworld has quickly and unexpectedly become one of my favorite shows of all time. It's a show that manages to make the viewer ask questions about human existence and human morality. ,2016
10,"If you've watched the original film, you will approach watching Westworld with an understanding of the basic premise and a moderate expectation of entertainment. That is how I approached it, and my expectations were taken to another level. Westworld is, put simply, a contemporary screenplay masterpiece. It has taken the original premise and intelligently added layers of complexity to its plot that resonate with where humanity finds itself in the 21st century. What is consciousness? What is humanity? Where is the line? And how does this related to creating artificial consciousness? The original film failed to explain how 'what happened' happened. But the TV show eludes to the faultline between corporate sponsorship (The Board) and scientific enquiry. I will avoid spoilers for anyone who has not seen this yet, but in setting the seen the writers/producers have created Westworld not only as a TV show, but as a series of questions for humanity to ponder. And the acting is sublime, in particular Evan Rachel Wood & Thandie Newton's characters evoke empathy in my very core.",2016

10,"No spoilers... I haven't watched the original movie. I won't watch it either, because I want to be guided by this series. ",2016
10,"It's a beautifully layered story about the dawn of Artificial Intelligence, where the androids are becoming more & more emotional as they gain consciousness, and humans are becoming more homicidal as they lose their humanity. In a theme park world, where human actions are devoid of any consequences, as machines evolve by self-learning, they are becoming more enlightened than their creators. Bringing together huge names like Michael Crichton, Jonathan Nolan and Anthony Hopkins, along with a multi-million dollar budget, this show, just after a 9 episode run, looks promising enough to be the best TV show ever. Could it break the record-breaking following achieved by Game of Thrones, could it keep blowing away our mind even after a 5 season run like Breaking Bad...I can't wait to find out.",2016
1,"Let me warn you first that I am no fan of this series. It's so dire that I struggle to understand the outstanding ratings it apparently gets from so many people. I imagine they are swept away by the outstanding photography and expensive sets and thrilled by the gratuitous violence and plentiful nudity, also gratuitous.",2016
4,I had really big hopes for this show. In some aspects it delivered e.g. it looks good.,2016
3,"I haven't reviewed before, but as this series is approaching a 'masterpiece' score of 10, the kind of show I'd give anything to wipe from my memory (ironically appropriate) to enjoy again, I thought I'd contribute for a bit of balance. I'm not sure why it's garnering such scores, whether it's meta thing or because Nolan+HBO+huge budget=10, but I found 'Westworld' sadly lacking and a disappointment. I am a fan of the original 'Westworld', the memory of the calmly unrelenting and menacing Yul Brynner reminds me now of an early T500.",2016

7,"To begin with I'll admit that one of the reasons I started watching Westworld was its positive IMDb rating (yes I'm one of those people) but having watched just the first few episodes I must unfortunately conclude that it has been rather over hyped. While the futuristic premise is interesting and it is something I usually love as with the likes of Humans, Black Mirror, The Matrix, Inception etc it's delivery here is quite poor. When dealing with technology and future worlds attention to detail is IMO THE most important thing to get right- I can take poor individual character development as long the big picture is made clear-that's why I'd actually rate Surrogates (the movie 2009- with Bruce Willis) on a par with this series because where it lacked character depth it didn't over complicate the story or bring in too many elements and it at least gave us some idea of how and why people and society became how they were through the evolution of the surrogate technology involved and showed how this in turn had real world effects that were both good and bad for society and the individual people in it. Unfortunately Westword doesn't really do this.",2016

4,"Great show with great visuals. Anyone would say that because it is, however there are so many things wrong with it and so many flow breaks and just irritating scenes. Anyone with a scientific background can see how literally no research has gone into this series. The whole arc with the bar woman forcing the two guys to remove her restrictions is awful. Both had no reason to do it but still did it to continue the story. Their acting is meh and how it still carried on after 2/3 episodes is puzzling. Knife wounds how are they stopped, physical damage? The ONLY thing in this series that is interesting is the Ford/Arnold/Man In Black stories because of the acting and the seriousness that surrounds them. Those stories have purpose and is actually good writing the rest is just straight garbage for sci-fi fan service. There's my vent ignore it or whatever but that's what I think.

10,"I see a lot of people gave it a bad review but its actually really good, If you still don't watch it please judge it after you watch it its above my expectation.The visuals,the setting etc. don't believe everything you read. The people who gave it a bad review actually want the show to be 100% same as the comics which will be boring, but they actually took many things from the comics and there are dark comics too, the trailer on YouTube sucks watch the show. also the cast are amazing, the actings are really good and the tone of the show is exceptional, the show is on The CW and it airs every Thursday at 9/8c. This is my invitation to y'all please watch it.",2017
10,"I am a die hard fan of the comic series and I know the characters in and out from the comic books. So initially I was disappointed to see the characters being slightly played from a different perspective but the show grows into you. If you love Archies, you cannot at any cost avoid this show. Its different but has certain essential elements from the Archies and I urge viewers to watch it with an open mind. I must admit that the casting has been phenomenal. The acting is great though I expected better from the character Jughead.The storyline is promising. Its obligatory to watch the show because as an advent fan of Archies you would definitely want to see the characters in real life.",2017
8,"I have never read or even read the Archie comic books , so this review is based only the TV series",2017
1,"Riverdale is basically a harder-hitting Teen Wolf, imo. The biggest problem comes with the way they handle the relationship Archie has with his teacher. The writers don't seem brave enough to use the term ""statutory rape"" even when they are more than willing to have characters call out slut-shaming. It feels inconsistent, one minute they're trying to address important issues, the next they're making awful jokes about gay people. the thing that was a deal-breaker for me was the handling of Archie and his teacher, miss grundy, who is a good 20 years older than Archie. Although archie's dad tells him it's ""not his fault"" in the last few minutes of ep 4, his friends constantly tell him how much trouble he's in for being ~in a relationship~ with his teacher, rather than being horrified that their teacher is raping their 15- year-old best friend. The fact that they have archie and his teacher make out several times and have a sex scene as well in a steamy car is creepy, because they shoot these scenes like regular love scenes, with sexy music and everything. For me it's even worse because the actor is still a teenager and the actress is in her mid thirties.",2017
1,"Please do not watch this if you have any love for the original comics! If the first episode is any indication, this series will horrify those looking for anything resembling the original characters and plot. The show appears to be the result of someone coming up with a trashy plot with just enough sex and LGBT moments to be eye-catching to the modern day TV connoisseur, but couldn't get any where with it until they took the characters from a classic comic. The very basic, bare minimum requirements for it to still be considered Archie are met, but I cannot imagine where the rest of it came from. I know its the CW, but it's Archie for Pete's sake!",2017
1,"Unfortunately this is not remotely close to the original spirit of the comics... and the characters where changed (in some cases dramatically) to pander to certain ethic groups and orientations. While the idea was mildly interesting,it's execution is extremely poor. If you removed the 5 obvious people of color in the first episode (only one of them male, BTW), you could have called it the Vampire diaries 2, with no loss.",2017
1,"I liked Archie from back in the day and gave this show a go. It was OK at the start, then about three episodes in it talks about this black girls grandma that got horrible hate mail because she was black, then a few scenes later this group of girls find this item and then start talking about how they are not objects and basically feminism. One of the main characters is gay which I guess was introduced in 2010 comics (202). Always gotta get that gay character. I guess all they need is a transgender to really butcher the memory of what Archie once was while bringing it into this twisted age of political correctness.",2017
1,ARCHIE comic books were enjoyable reading for children preteen and younger cheerfully fantasizing about what our teen years would be like. This current RIVERDALE prime time soap has turned our beloved comic books (and later Saturday morning cartoon series) into something hateful in no way resembling the comics we all loved as children. Perhaps Melissa Joan Hart should reprise her role as Teen Witch Sabrina (an Archie spin off character) and visit Riverdale turning it back into the idyllic town we all loved. We can only hope for that as a great series finale.,2017
1,"I wish I could be positive. I wish there was one redeeming thing about this. I wish I could tell you there was something worth seeing here. But nothing is going to save this lead balloon. Rerunning it on another day isn't going to do it either. Totally shallow and ugly take on Archie and the crew, bad acting, poor character development, nothing redeeming whatsoever. The hacks that came up with this idea, along with whoever approved it for production should all be in an unemployment line, with orders not to return to television. Worst I've seen in a long time. I predict it will have almost zero viewers after introduction, and will be pulled within weeks.",2017
1,"Honestly to sum it up pretty quickly: this could seriously be any horrible CW teen drama with the names switched out. Literally just a bad show wearing Archie's skin. There's no actual reason this has to be an Archie show. The pacing is awful, the characters are dull and flat, the mystery is boring, the show takes itself way too seriously, and above all it's just ripping off Twin Peaks minus all the interesting bits. I fail to see why this had to be made or why we have to keep getting these washed up shitty teen dramas. Not all teenagers are this attractive or look like they're in their late 20s. I feel like these teen dramas are just a weird color by the numbers sort of thing. Like you need a sex scandal, a murder, at least one crying teen per episode, something about drugs, a really moody character, everyone has to be extremely attractive, lots of underage sex for some reason, and of course nobody actually looks their age. IMDb made me stretch this out to ten lines, but all in all the show is complete trash.",2017
10,"The writing is frustratingly amateurish. Every single line is on-the-nose exposition, where the characters tell you everything that has happened in their lives and their motivations for living. Veronica is openly monologuing about what happened to her dad even after the characters have told her they heard about it. Archie's dad is monologuing to Veronica's mom about everything that her husband did like she didn't have any clue. And then my god in the cheerleading tryouts when that red-haired chick tells Betty to tell Veronica about what happened with her sister and her brother as if that had anything to do with the scene whatsoever. The idea of showing instead of telling is the first rule every screenwriter learns, and so far this looks like a writer that doesn't have enough passion in his work to take the time to show us the drama rather than have the characters openly monologue about it. You don't need Betty to monologue about her love for Archie when you easily could have just shown her eyeing him affectionately. You don't need to have that red-haired chick randomly make Betty monologue about their siblings relationship when you can just show a god-damn broken picture frame or something. Instead of making Archie's dad monologue about the embezzlement debacle, just simply have him say, ""Trust a Lodge with money? That's rich."" It doesn't outright let you know her dad's in trouble for embezzlement, but it lets you know the Lodge's are notoriously bad with money, and gives the chance to lay out more clues later in the series so the audience can feel smart when they put the pieces together. You don't need to know every bit of backstory in the first ten minutes of a TV show. You just need to lay the groundwork for people to piece together what happened. Not only does that lower the run time, but it doesn't make the audience feel like you're force feeding them plot. It sucks because I actually like the characters and am interested in the story, but there's only so much eye rolling I can do before I call it quits with this series. Stop treating your audience like idiots! We can comprehend things without being blatantly told! The characters should act like they are talking to real people not reciting what they wrote in their diary last night! It's like some sort of AA meeting with everyone standing up and giving their life story to anybody that will listen. That right there was a simile. (Do you see how maddening it is to have something so obvious pointed out to you?) ",2017

At least these are watchable and in line of what they represent.) Riverdale lacks everything that make's Archie a great read..1 episode is enough for me, in fact the first 10 minutes should have been all i wasted on this rubbish...The best way to watch this, would be.

10,With its amazing 80s atmosphere and creepy X-files meets E.T feel this show is set to impress. Within its first 8 minutes of run time I could tell I had found something special here in Stranger Things. ,2016
10,"I've been trying to put my reaction to this series into cohesive sentences - even cohesive thoughts - and I just can't seem to do it. ""Stranger Things"" blended the best parts of some of the great 80's sci-fi films from ""E.T."" to ""Poltergeist"" to ""The Goonies"" to my all time favorite, ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind."" It was simply brilliant, and brings you back to a time when you were still able to feel a sense of wonder.",2016
10,"Just watched the first chapter last night. Everything about it is great, the actors, the writing, the fact that it takes place in the FREAKING 80s (YES!) and all the music. The theme music is completely on point...very John Carpenter-ish with heavy synthesizer sounds that are very menacing. Watch this show, tell your friends to watch. It feels very Stephen King/Steven Spielberg..with some X-Files mixed in. I have never seen the kid actors before but they were all so good. Their on screen chemistry reminded me of the group of friends from The Explorers, Stand By Me or The Goonies but it's definitely not lighthearted or a comedy at all. It's always a good sign that a show is going to be good when you are completely sucked in within the first couple minutes. 10 out of 10 so far.Ôªø",2016
8,"First off, I'm going to say that I did enjoy the show. The acting was good, the music was top notch, and the cinematography was great! So why did I give it a 7/10? Quite simply it's plot is simplistic, it isn't that scary or suspenseful when it claims to be and I found the majority of the characters bland. I only really cared about the cop, Jim Hopper and the kid, Dustin. Everyone else wasn't really given a second thought until they reappeared on screen. ",2016
9,What can I say Netflix has done it again!,2016
10,"ATTENTION TO ALL OF YOU WHO LIVED YOU'RE YOUTH IN YEARS 80, liked movies like Goonies, Portergeist, The Evil Dead, The Thing, Alien(s), Star Wars, ET, Clouse Encounters of the Third Degree, Indiana Jones, It - Stephen King, Lord of the Rings (ok, this is newer, but the books are older and the references are all there) and so many other fantastic and unbeatable classics of that magic decade. I have to say: Watch THIS, STRANGER THINGS! Oh really. Watch it. But watch accordingly: at night, turn off your mobile, whats-app, Facebook, Instagram, blah blah blah, watch as you should watch every movie, with immersion, transport yourself into the adventure, and I assure you, you will remember how it used to be, when going to the movies itself was already an adventure. You will be transported to the 80's. Cool characters, family dramas, pure and sincere friendships among nerd, intelligent, and excluded children, teenage's dramas, music and soundtrack of the 80s, in every detail, from the suspense in songs of each scene, the opening song and title of the series, the soundtrack, the references/homage to the 80's is very strong, very clear. I loved it. For me, it is among the 2 best series I've seen in the last 10 years, with only Game of Thrones at the same level. I cannot think of any other that has given me so much pleasure to watch, which has given me the desire to watch again, and again, and again. No, not even Breaking Bad, Marvel's Daredevil, The Walking Dead, The Expanse (unknown by many, but i liked), NCIS, etc. I'm looking here at the list of series that I follow (around 50), and none is equal to the entertainment provided by this. Congratulations to the Duffer brothers. The series is amazing. Worth every minute.",2016
10,"This is one of the most magical things I have ever had the fortune of viewing. I won't go into details about the narrative, which is build on classic sci-fi and horror concepts and it works. But what really makes this show excel is the little things. The casting is amazing - every single character, regardless of how small the part is, feels like a complete character, and the main cast delivers some powerful stuff all throughout the series. The production is spot on in it's portrayal of a small town in the 80's, and I have to assume that it is in part based on the creators own experiences and childhood, because everything feels real.",2016
10,"Netflix does it again! I'll admit, I was excited for this show just based on the genre it was listed as being in and so far it has not disappointed. With the exception of a few of the adults most of the cast was unknown to me which only adds to the level of immersion the show can reach. The two performers I was familiar with, Winona Ryder and David Harbour are both magnificent. A few things about Stranger Things are extraordinary and could only be done by Netflix. One, this show is suspenseful and engaging so waiting for a week to see the next episode would change the entire dynamic and would really be a bummer, Stranger Things must be binged! Second, the creators of this series are, like the young actors, unknown to me. Matt and Ross Duffer. Brothers that through conventional methods may not have had the opportunity to bring this show to life, get that opportunity from Netflix. In the past few years television has changed wildly. If you were a writer or actor five years ago you would much rather be a movie star than a television star, those distinctions have all but vanished. This change was brought on by many factors but I'd like to take this opportunity to applaud Netflix for their role. It is no coincidence that they started doing their own programming right around the same time these changes began. Bravo and please start filming season two of Stranger Things ASAP!",2016

6,"Stranger Things is cool, but ultimately disappointing. Though I love 80's horror and sci-fi as much as the next weirdo, I feel like if you're going to invoke such a loud stylistic lexicon you need to bring something new to the table, something of your own to balance the appropriation and allusion.

6,"I'm not gonna write a long review because I don't want to repeat what many others have said. Stranger Things is a good show- it's very well directed and acted, it has a pretty interesting mystery, and some of the first episodes are pretty creepy- but it is nowhere near the level of quality many people say it is. I liked the amount of suspense and horror in the first few episodes, but as the show went on it became more about the uninspired characters and less about the mystery, sci fi and horror, and when we finally saw the Demagorgen it looked really cheap. I've watched all of the episodes, and the only episodes that impressed me were the second one, which had a great first half but dropped the ball a bit in the last 30 minutes, and Holly Jolly. I think (like some people have already said), the super-high rating this show has on IMDb might just be because so many people are nostalgic about the 80's and not because Stranger Things is actually one of the best shows ever. Stranger Things isn't a bad show, but it's nowhere near as good as people say it is.",2016
6,"After a phenomenal first season, I feel Stranger Things has completely lost its edge; recycling the same ideas we've seen on TV a million times before. First, I thought this season was a complete recycle of an episode of Fringe I saw a couple of years back, called: Alone in the World; Fringe was an American science fiction television series that ran from 2008-2013. In this episode, the Fringe team discover a large fungal network in a service tunnel which is actually part of a superorganism that functioned like the Shadow Monster. The infection also psychically connects to a young boy (named Aaron), who discovered the phenomenon, and if the Fringe team try to kill the organism, Aaron dies too. The Fringe team also finds that the organism is growing rapidly; creating its own ecosystem with tentacles and death spores for defence. Sound familiar? Google it. Furthermore, Joyce, Johnathan and Nancy make Will's body inhabitable to the Shadow Monster by increasing the temperature, because the monster likes the cold, which is identical to something I saw a season or two ago in Supernatural, in an episode called: The Things They Carried. Even, Elevens adventures this season could have been taken straight out of the pages of the Firestarter miniseries; based on Charlie McGee, a young girl with psychokinetic powers. I am sure Eleven is based on the character Charlie McGee, however, at least try to bring us an original story. ",2017
4,"I only manage to finish this series by ""purge watching."" It's my own term. It's the opposite of ""binge watching"" where you're apparently so enraptured by a show you can't stop watching. ""Purge watching"" is when you can't wait for a series to be over, so you use the fast forward button during the throw-away, series-padding scenes. And there's a lot of padding in the show. Like a cheap Stephen King Santa. Honestly, are we supposed to really accept this asa ""homage"" or is it just the ultimate recycling job? A number of critics thought 8 hours devoted to the somewhat thin story of ""Stranger Things"" was excessive. I was thinking about the story in my head, and if it hadn't been given the soap opera drag out treatment, condensed down to a 2-hour movie it would have been even worse -- exposing more clearly the basic silliness and retread plot. The watered-down tempo helped what otherwise would have been Cream of Condensed Tripe. You could claim running the same old numbers is in the name of ""homage"" or you could argue there's really not a lot of new ideas in the show. From the first scene where the scientists get pulled upward into the elevator, dangled by an unseen beast, I went ""ho hum."" Like I haven't see that visual in a million monster films. An old clever show like the X-Files would have had a pair of eyes creepily material in the wall of an elevator and then maybe the doors close and a scream. That show as extremely creative at coming up with original ideas and images -- which is why it was a great show. But immediately I wasn't that impressed with the ""Duffer Brothers"" mise en scene. I need more ""things I've never seen before"" from Sci-fi. And little touches like the elevator scene are where true originals and moderate talents separate themselves. I nearly bailed completely on the series. Episode 3&4 were sluggishly directed by Shawn Levy, who is pretty much an incompetent as a stylist. By episode 4, it has completely lost the ""vintage feel"" and leaning on the influences of contemporary cable: Let's play a moving piece of rock music over amontage of the different actors staring thoughtfully into space. The music swells... It's the HBO Method of audience intercourse. A directorial clich√©. Sorry, but this doesn't have the ""feel"" of a 70s or 80s production at all, maybe a bit in the opening episode or two, but it pretty much is quickly replaced by a run-of-the-mill cable show feel. Vintage Spielberg always had a very kinetic feel. 70s and early 80s films were riffing off the vibe of Altman, Pennebaker, Penn, but sanitizing them a bit and joking them up. The vibe of this series is probably closest in spirit to the lousy cheapie Steven King films, and not in a good way. It's a leaden feel. I'm still skeptical of the ""tribue"" aspect of this show The Winonna""Poltergiest"" ripoff/tribute is the worst bit so far. Where's the dwarf psychic? As I also noted they managed to pay ""homage"" to ""Under the Skin"" and ""Pan's Labyrinth"" Were those nostalgic ""homages?"" If your pose a show as a tribute (and make sure to let people know up front to cover your tracks) does that eradication the icky ""borrowing."" I think a couple of producers (the Duffers you would assume) sat down and said: ""Yeah, I like the kid with powers from FireStarter, let's use that. And the kids from ""It"". The whole kid thing from King. ""Alien"" was a great movie. How about goo? And we'll stay away from the afterlife and just make it a portal to another dimension...."" Add Shaw Levy's teleplay staging (someone should let him know the camera moves) and it's all a bit snoozy. By the way, I also notice that the Duffer Brothers didn't write the series. They farmed out the episodes to a bunch of writer. Right there, their auteur status goes down the drain, IMO. Interestingly, I noticed that the Duffer Brothers wrote the teleplay for Episode 8, but another writer suddenly turns up with a ""story by"" credit (for the first time in the series) for that episode. That tell's me the Duffers' couldn't even figure out how to put a cap on their own series and brought in someone else to make sense of it. And the ending is all pretty perfunctory and predictable. They even managed to reproduce Steven King's most reliable device ... not being able to produce a really satisfying ending. So anyway, that's that. I'd give it a""C."" And warn Steven King to keep his paper covered during the next test.",2016
5,"The strangest thing about this show is the fact that it is such a huge success. It is presented as an ""original"" series, but there's not a single character or situation in it that you haven's seen dozen times in other movies or TV shows before - just check the IMDb trivia and you will see what I mean. Conspiracy theory? Check. Government cover-up? Check. Alien/extra-dimensional monsters? Check. Shy and sensitive boy falling for the popular girl who dates a fool? Check. Worn-out cop who gets a new break? Check. You name it - if it is a clich√©, you will find it here. The cast is OK. Millie Bobby Brown is great and the other kids are good, but Matthew Modine looks uncomfortable as a villain whose voice we barely hear. This show has the undeniable virtue of being addictive and you can easily binge- watch it on a single free day, but then you ask yourself: ""So what?"" I had fun, but I as bored at some points and didn't feel like I had watched a great show like the Marvel and DC pieces I've been going through these days.",2017
7,"Entertaining to say the least and definitely a nice nostalgic trip back into the 80s. However, the show remains full of plot holes and a good part of it feels 'forced' and 'shaky'. While i binge-watched the show, it felt underwhelming and overacted. Season 1 was better, whereas this one let me down in hard to define ways (conclusion, useless scenes and jokes, poor character development, etc). Also, i really felt the need to give it a 7 star rating. IMDb was by go to reference but it seems that every new show nowadays always gets either a 10 or a 1. Too polarized. This show is DEFINITELY not a 9 or 10, and I would place it somewhere between 7 and 7.5, maybe.",2017

7,"I've just binge watched it up to the end of Episode 18. The initial premise is interesting, whether or not it's actually based in reality. You always need to grant some leeway with ""initial premises"", especially these days. I stopped watching 24 after the second season because I found it too infantile and silly. I did watch The West Wing through to the end. This is a sort of 24 meets The West Wing. The show lets itself down with too many loving gazes between the President and his wife (does she have any flaws at all?), some terribly clunky lines and worst of all, the relentless US Patriot, buzz word laden speeches. ""The American people deserve..."". ""Rebuilding our amazing nation..."". ""Rebuilding our fantastic Government"". There's no mention of lobbyists or Corporate involvement in Government. There's no mention of the profound disconnect between citizen and Government that is a feature of contemporary politics. The various ""third rails"" of US politics are briefly mentioned. It is a show about a fantasy America and a fantasy American Government. It's the TV Show version of America that is challenged by the initial events and it responds the way TV Show script writers think such a world would respond. Having said all that, it moves reasonably quickly and the split between the two story arcs is well handled and engaging. The only caveat is - if you find ""true blue, Mom and Apple Pie American sentimental patriotism"" too much to bear, you're going to struggle with this show. But it's probably worth bearing with, all in all. There are far, far worse shows on TV.",2017

5,"After having watched 7 episodes, my observation throughout has been that although the storyline is interesting and a good mystery, the white people in this series all seem to have serious character flaws, while the people of colour do not appear to have any flaws. The white men in particular are portrayed variously as being inept, weak, unsuccessful, angry, non-team players, terrorist, and in the case of the young son of the new president, a drug dealer. The woman who is the 2nd designated survivor cannot be trusted, is manipulative and out for herself. The people of colour, in contrast, are all portrayed as being intelligent, team players, reasonable, victims, capable of saving the day or solving the problem. One of them even gets promoted after leaking White House information to the press in an act of insubordination to the President.",2017

5,"Had to take the time to write this review. I had high hopes, and perhaps still do...the premise and Sutherland and Kal Penn give the show potential but after 2 episodes all I see is Americana sappy over the top sentimentality. I hope it gets better and will give it time yet but so far I had to keep from gagging. An exercise in political correctness so far. Oh the poor Muslims, ooh the racial profiling, ooh the poor heroes (has anyone paid attention to how ineffective and corrupt congress is recently). The stereotypical war monging general etc...I think Kal Penn has the best character so far. Sutherland has potential because he is Keifer but I wish the writers could have been more intelligent about how the addressed the issues they want to explore...which are all important issues of course but one would think they could have been ""smarter"" about how they did it rather than belch out another America shall overcome clich√©. So watch at your own peril. I may choose to change my rating after a few more episodes but for the moment I gave it a 5 rating because they could have done much better with the cast and subject matter instead of pandering to American narcissism.",2016
1,I'm a big Kiefer Sutherland fan. Loved 24 and this had real opportunity to be entertaining and interesting. The pilot was good and this could have been really great.

She's also not interesting and the ""action scenes"" with her are like the A-team or mcgyver. just amateurish. (just like the black screened beeping Hollywood computers they use, with awful animations.) Then there is the wife and kids and it's just too sweet. The ""designated survivor"" thing is a very interesting story. I wish there were flash back episodes, why the attackers did it. How was the situation before? Also make Keifer suck. Let him make wrong decisions, be a lousy husband that secretly enjoys all this new power.",2017
3,"Not long ago I read a comment from a major network executive about how they could do programming on a par with some of the critically acclaimed shows from HBO, Showtime, A&E etc. This show speaks volumes of why they just cannot seem to do it.",2016
1,"The first episode was excellent. It made me think, FINALLY FAR left, liberal Hollywood producers made a politically incorrect show...like the brilliant and very missed ""24"". Unfortunately, I quickly found out in the second episode this was going to be another liberal nonsense show where Muslims are the victims, while the evil, racist American white people are to blame.

10,"I see a lot of polarising reviews for this show. I really liked the pilot as I had no clue about the ""designated survivor"". You have to give the shoemakers points for picking a very interesting premise and executing it smoothly in the pilot itself. This show brings back Keifer Sutherland as the hero we rely upon though not as a action hero but a more reserved almost nerdy POTUS. Let me just simply tell you why you should watch the show in comparative manner: It is no 24 neither is it The House of Cards or the West Wing .. but it is certainly better and more engaging that plenty of hit shows today - e.g Quantico, Blacklist, Blindspot. I have given it an 8 out of 10 for pure entertainment that it provides. Performance wise every actor is perfect in their roles, especially the person who played Congressman McLeish. Although my only gripe is the story arc of the President's son. He is going to be The Homeland's Dana of this show. I have to say the actor playing the son himself is a good actor, his story arc isn't. Watch the show. A very exciting conspiracy filled political thriller.",2016
5,"This was such a promising start of a new soap. Great first episode, moderate second one and then it went downhill. Just finished seeing episode 17 and my feeling is like this: when did The Last Survivor became Brothers & Sisters? ",2017
1,"As a big Jack Bauer fan on ""24"" I had high hopes for this show but it gets more ridiculous as the series progresses.",2016
10,"It really is an older Jack Bauer as the President. He doesn't need a gun anymore, but his moral compass is just as strong. His character is learning what it means to have power and manipulate people to do what is needed. ",2016
10,"To be honest, I was worried that a show based around anything remotely ""Political"" in today's current climate would turn into a mess quickly. I'm happy to find that based on the pilot I was way wrong this time around. Keifer Sutherland has always been an understated actor with remarkable range and a strange charm and it really shines here. Quite the opposite of his former iconic role as the heroic martyr Jack Bauer, he conveys a calm fear and nervousness that any man thrust into this terrifying position would certainly inhabit. The supporting cast is strong, the plot is smart and well written, and the subject matter is more engaging than it even sounds on paper. If they can keep up this intensity while maintaining the quality displayed in the first episode, we could potentially have a real winner here.",2016
5,"well, that was quick.....nice first episode and then the second is liberal Hollywood BS. plus, kiefer's character is just too weak......i get the idea he will toughen up but this is stupid. there is no way a weak character like that will ever get tough....he's like 55....if they are that big a pus then it ain't happening. ",2016
1,"The pilot episode was outstanding, I was instantly hooked.",2016
7,"6.5 stars. I think the premise of the show had a lot of hope, but I'm a little surprised by the lazy writing and character development.",2016
2,"As a non-American I really don't understand why American writers think the world revolves around them, their (ineffective) Congress, President etc. This show could have been much more suspense and realistic, but mid-way through the second episode I had to stop because it is CRINGE WORTHY,d even if the events from the first episode really happened there would be no time for 'cutesy' moments or anything of sorts, and it feels like it's written just to stir up feelings between liberal vs not-so-liberal Americans (racial profiling, political correctness being issue), but of course the 'new president' is trying to do 'the right thing' and for the 'sake of the people' when the American government is the total opposite. This show makes no sense unless you want to feel like a sheep chewing on propaganda materials. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",2016
3,"Was really excited when I read the synopsis for this. Political intrigue, a scenario that I haven't seen on screen before and Kiefer Sutherland - what's not to like? Well, just about everything as it turns out so far...",2016
1,"It's simply unfathomable that America after such huge and unprecedented tragic attack would be so dull and relaxed. The series doesn't capture any of the drama in the aftermath of such occurrence. Apart from some shiny moments with Sutherland, the series is soapy, boring and stereotypical. The acting is mediocre and not very believable. The plot is thin and characters are shallow. Music (melodramatic phony songs) ridiculous and series original score absent. The sense of urgency is also missing, there's not swift reappointment of the cabinet or real talk about special elections to reinstate congress and resume legislative operations. The series is nothing like House of Cards, where even every subtle and tiny political act is thrill inducing and watch-worthy. I don't see how this series can progress from that. Absolutely detached from reality and soapy TV show while it could have been one of the best.",2016
1,"I was looking forward to Designated Survivor because I enjoyed 24 and this has a similar exciting story line. But, it quickly deteriorated into snarky political commentary, politically correct story line, implausible caricatures of important officials. All in all, a disappointment and waste of time. One of the generals is seen ""plotting"" a takeover of the government after a horrendous terrorist attack, which would never happen. Other, civilian branches of government, yes, but not the military. They actually have discipline.",2016
3,"I was looking forward to this show. But I think Kiefer should have kept his word when he said ""no more TV shows for me after 24"".",2016
4,"It's a letdown. The fun and charming bits of Harry Potter were left out of this film. I like J.K. Rowling's work immensely, so that's hard to say.",2016
7,"I really want to draw attention to the title of the review above. I'm sure many die-hard potterheads would want every review on this site to score this movie 10/10 and say it is a masterpiece. Well I can't do that, since that isn't my honest opinion. What I can say though is that Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a thoroughly entertaining affair that is well worth a watch, especially if you're a fan of J.K. Rowling's magical world. ",2016
1,"David Yates has done it again - what a terrible movie. Boring from beginning to end. J.K. Rowling just wasn't able to write a script that could live up to the Harry Potter books and universe. Fantastic? Not so much. Beasts? Sure, lots of them, but uninteresting. Where to find them? All inside a magical bag. There's absolutely no character development: we get to know very little about Newt Scamander, his personal quest, his thoughts or what drives him; Tina is just bland; and Kowalski is a comic relief that just wasn't necessary. Throughout the movie, you never understand why Newt has a ""Noah complex"" or why he was driven to build his own Ark of magical creatures; there's no tension, no drama involved - muggles don't know about those creatures, so they can't hate them or understand how dangerous they might be, and wizards just don't seem to care enough about them. Why exactly was Newt expelled from Hogwarts? What exactly was his relation to Leta Lestrange? We just don't know. Graves was an interesting character, but very poorly developed. Sure, he is revealed to be something more and we couldn't know too much, but we never get to understand the context in which he professes his ideology. For a movie that revolves around magic, there's actually not that much magic being used during the movie. Maybe next time they should try a movie with less special effects and a little bit more acting. The Harry Potter books were always about the narrative - well written, enticing, thrilling, focused on big existential issues, such as death, the quest for immortality, friendship. This movie was about the visual power of cinema, and that just isn't enough. Besides, a whole generation grew up with Harry Potter, a generation that actually ""grew up"", so a PG movie won't work.",2016
3,"Fantastic beasts and where you find them. Well¬Ö Not somewhere interesting. In fact, some place that is pretty scattered and incoherent, and very much boring.",2016
3,"I was excited to take another plunge into the wizarding world of J.K. Rowling. I greatly enjoyed the Harry Potter (HP) books and, despite some flaws, the HP movies.",2016
1,It is unbelievable that JK Rowling's name is even attached to this film.,2016
8,"Perhaps the biggest dilemma you will have before going into this, is whether or not it will live up to the legend of Harry Potter. As someone who loved the series and was skeptical about Yates undertaking this endeavor, I am pleased to say that I'm relieved, As Yates delivers a refreshing and whimsical film. Sure, it doesn't have the characters we've come to love, but with the creatures you encounter and with the added humor of J.K Rowling, you will come to grip with the fact that this movie will leave an impression.",2016
8,"I admit walking into the theater, I was very excited but also a little apprehensive. I should not have worried at all though, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was incredibly enjoyable! Rowling's magical world is as alluring and fun as ever! For me, the best thing about this movie is exactly that. Exploring this world.",2016
8,"The magical community in Britain has been fleshed out rather well through the seven Harry Potter books and the eight films that followed, but America's magic users have been pretty much overlooked.",2016
1,"Since when movies like this one took over? No plot, no characters development, no substance, cheap jokes here and there and CGI filling up space. Just another film that tries to squeeze bucks out of franchise without genuine effort.",2016
4,"Although I was a fan of the Harry Potter series, I had no preconceived notions or requirements for this stand-alone movie, other than an expectation that J.K. Rowling would not disappoint.",2016
1,This move is just awful.,2017
8,"How do you make a 'Harry Potter' movie without Harry Potter? Before the last of the eight films of J.K. Rowling's staggeringly popular universe five years ago, that must have been the conundrum facing Warner Brothers executives as they stared at the end of the line of their most lucrative franchise. And yet thanks to Rowling herself as well as series stalwart David Yates, there is once again new life to be found in the world of witchcraft and wizardry that she had dreamt up in the seven books of the boy wonder. The inspiration is one of Harry's textbooks at Hogwarts, an essential text which served as a guide to magical animals written by one Newt Scamander. Rowling had written it into a companion piece in 2001, but as those who had read the 128- page book will tell you, there is a lot more that Rowling must have had to add to her first movie script even as an adaptation of that earlier book.",2016
9,"Amazing movie, they've done it again! The cast was amazing (though Johnny Depp as Grindewald takes time to get used to),visual effects stunning and the movie is everything you can except it to be. The movie has so many great moments, it's happy and funny yet serious enough and has AMAZING humour, I laughed a lot while watching it and so did everyone else :) LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS MOVIE and can't wait to see more!!! I also love the fact that they didn't try to continue the Potter series but instead made a ''stand alone'' movie franchise which has so many connections to the Harry Potter books/movies, it really made me feel like they're not trying to ''milk us'' but just want to provide us more amazing movies from the world we all love so much :)",2016
1,Spoiler Free,2016
7,"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a spin-off of the highly successful Harry Potter-franchise. Naturally, there were great expectations for this first part of a whole new franchise in the J.K. Rowling's wizarding world and I can honestly say that it delivers everything you would dreamed of.",2016
5,"This movie is clearly written by someone who is not used to writing movies. Which, of course, is disastrous when making a fantasy flick. Nothing serves a creative, fantasy story better than a tight, well-executed plot. I mean, look at Star Wars!",2016
1,"I am a massive fan of Harry Potter, and this movie was a disappointment, and a disgrace. I have a lot of issues with this movie, so I am sorry if this seems disorganized. For the most part, I had been happy with the other movies, and I loved the Harry Potter movies that David was making. I had very high hopes for this movie. However, I didn't think I was going to love it, I wanted to, but I was let down. I own the original book, and there was not much to go on. There was a time line of Newt's life, information about the magical creatures, and that was it. That is all there was, and they both had a lot of freedom with this story. However, it also had to fit, and make sense with the existing Harry Potter series, and that world. They failed. The time line from the original book, was completely messed up. The magic, was wrong, and unbelievable. The American ministry, was a let down. I felt like the movie was stereotyping Americans, in a bad way. With that, and me being a Hufflepuff, I also felt like Hufflepuff's were being stereotyped. The plot and the name didn't fit. Okay, so the time line. The time line in the original book is so very different from the movie. An entire page, which was dedicated to Newt's life, was ignored. While I am on this, the plot. Having it be called Fantastic Beasts, you would imagine it would be about that, but it wasn't. They took a backseat in the movie. Also, what few beats that were in the movie, some of the information about them was wrong. Also, that whole internalized magic thing¬Ö SO MANY PLOT HOLES!!!!!!!!! ""Oh you won't live to be ten."" but then this guy is 19. Also, they were NEVER talked about in HP. There were people with suppressed magic, there were squibs. I would assume that they would have become these whatever you wanna call em. Also, who would ever name a bookstore/publishing after something evil? Oh! Right! No one! This also brings us into the magic¬Ö So much was wrong with it. It had NO color. Also, was anyone else bugged by the liquefied charm at the end?! I had most of my issues with that. In HP 7 we learned that that spell works on wizards, but in FB it doesn't? ALSO! It can go through WALLS, but it can't go underground, or through glass?! REALLY?!?!?!?!?!?!? AND!! The leader of the American wizard government! I am all for it being an African American woman, but in the 1920's (Did NOT feel like America in the 1920's either!)? No. She made me mad though. ""Oh, I don't have time to hear you."" Later ""Why didn't you come to us sooner."" And then there was this little treat! ""You cannot use magic in front of muggles!"" later ""Let ME use magic to save myself, and let the muggles die after they see me use magic."" REALLY?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?! There was more with all of this, again I had A LOT of issues with this movie, but let's get to the main one, at the end¬Ö Grindelwald. Now, I am all for him being there, and I think the fight between him and Dumbledore would be cool (The short did an amazing job, and I loved it, but I would love to see the main one.), however¬Ö The movie is making it seem like it is going to be Grindelwald vs. Newt, and not Grindelwald vs. Dumbledore which is how it actually was. Overall, I absolutely hated this movie. There were so many things wrong with it, this just covers a few of them. I honestly have no idea how this movie is doing as well as it it¬Ö This was a massive disappointment. I will not watch the other four. Oh yeah¬Ö Four¬Ö. Not two¬Ö four¬Ö.. Good luck. This movie is pretty much over and done with.",2016
1,"I love Harry Potter and I enjoyed to watch every movie about this beautiful universe. But after watching this film, I felt violated. The only connection with the original HP was the opening title with the famous HP melody. The rest of the movie was a complete incomprehensible mess. Not only the plot was bad, but the whole acting of this amazing cast looked fake and unprofessional. I couldn't stand seeing frozen face of Eddie Redmayne for two hours, who never looked in the eyes of his companions during the talk and was always smiling. His crash, Katherine Waterston was a gray mice, can't remember much of her. Her sister (Alison Sudol) was beyond fake. Thanks god there was a funny muggle Dan Fogler who saved me from falling asleep. The appearance of Jonny Depp was quite ridiculous. Dude, go retire, please.",2016
6,"Meh. Just meh. This film looks like a 50 dollar steak but tastes like a turkey sandwich you forgot about in the refrigerator for a day. It isn't bad but doesn't make you want anymore. And I think that is why they had to shoehorn Johnny Depp in at the end of this, because otherwise no one would care enough to watch a sequel. The dude playing the wizard looking for his pets is meh. The story felt like filler. I honestly have no idea why people consider this film anything other than mediocre. I guess die-hard Harry Potter fans are so desperate for more Harry Potter stuff on the big screen that they are willing to pretend this film is something special when it really isn't.",2017
3,I will keep this brief....,2016
1,"I had high hopes for this movie. I was excited to go! However, the plot was painfully boring. The CGI looked incredibly fake. And the whole subplot was just plain creepy. I was so disappointed. It was immediately obvious who was the bad guy and there were definitely some bizarre interactions between characters. Honestly, you don't really love or hate any character in the movie, even though, from the first minute, you really, REALLY want to like one of them. There was nothing that felt really magical about this. It was just bland and boring. If you are seeking another magical movie from the Harry Potter franchise, this is not that. You might love it, but if you are truly honest with yourself, I'd doubt it.",2016
10,"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them... It's not Harry Potter, however it is a classic in its own right. I loved the creature creations for this movie including of course those greedy goblins which I was so very happy to see in this film as well. Eddie Redmayne did such a wonderful job as Newt Scamander and his cast of creatures was breathtaking. They were all created differently and beautifully in their own right. His deep connection and understanding of the creatures was so well done by Redmayne who seemed to be a little Autistic with his lack of eye contact most of the time while talking, which if it was done on purpose, I love it. It gives the character even more depth and beauty. The other wizards were amazing, I think my favorite was Queenie Goldstein she was so endearing and such a wonderfully played character. She had a lot of heart and that endeared her to the audience even more. It was cool to see the differences between the American and British Ministries of Magic and the difference in terminologies between the two countries. All in all this movie gets 5 enthusiastic stars from me. The continuity was incredible and I highly recommend it.",2016
1,"I was actually holding on to keep watching this movie in theater. I should have left it in the middle. It was a waste of 2hr. The movie was SOOOOOO slow. The audio was terrible. The Video was also terrible, all dark and cant see anything. The story was predictable and not interesting at all except the last scene. And to be honest it wasn't a shocker since they have showed a man at the beginning and then we all were waiting him to appear somewhere. It is waste of your money, time and space in your brain. I am a huge fan of HP but I am kinda disappointed. They shouldn't make more of this movie. Its quite waste of resources.",2016

10,"Looks like FX has once again found another island in the rough with their new show ""Atlanta"". Creator, Writer and Actor Donald Glover (no relation to actor Danny Glover) is that guy who everything seems to happen to him and/or around him. Featuring a primarily cast of color, Brian Tyree Henry, Keith Stansfield and Zadie Beetz (each established actors) will surely become household names with this series. Like some of my other favorite FX shows (The Americans, AHS, FARGO, You're the Worst), ""Atlanta"" is gritty, in-your-face and realistically captures a slice of life rarely shown on TV. ""Atlanta"" is an adult show about climbing the ranks into the rap scene, and surviving the neighborhood, that shouldn't be missed.",2016
9,"Atlanta, created and written by the multi-talented Donald Glover presents an intriguing, dynamic chemistry between an enigmatic Earn Marks (Donald Glover) and the stern, hostile, hood-driven city of Atlanta. A college drop out, Earn Marks seems to be living life at the bottom of a pit; a broke father, estranged by his parents and engaged with an absurd relationship with a girlfriend who mothers his daughter (unclear) - everything seems bleak. However, when news breaks out that his cousin Alfred 'Paper Boi' Miles (Brian Tyree Henry) is now the new hot rapper on the block, Earn drops everything he is doing to pursue the job of being Paper Boi's manager.

10,"A huge TV buff, I made an account just to start reviewing after I watched this show. It is all around perfect. It's a dry humor, with very witty writing- but has me laughing all the way through. It's a bit awkward when things get serious, but the serious parts are strongly acted and are very deep and moving. ",2016

I want to keep seeing every week what happens with them. ",2016
10,"As a fan of the rap/Hip hop culture, I've already been introduced to Donald Glover, aka Childish Gambino. Just seeing him in the preview for this show got me excited. The show is centered around a young man named Alfred 'paper boy' miles and his cousin Earn Marks. Alfred is an up and coming rapper from Atlanta that just released his first mix-tape and his cousin,earn, see's he has potential. Being in the financial crisis he is, and having his knowledge, Earn sees an opportunity to make himself some money as 'paper boy's' manager, all the while trying to get his cousin to the big leagues.

So like any sensible person, I waited until things cooled off before I decided to dive into it. The distance really helped me watch the show for what it, at least from the first season, is - a very offbeat show that deals less with plot and more with the mundanities of life than I would have expected from it, nor would I have ever wanted.",2017

7,"''Atlanta'' is a weird show! And you read this from a guy who has seen lot of weird things in films and television. I started this show because I needed a smart comedy and somebody recommended me this show. I'm not into the American black hip hop scene so I wasn't expecting to really get into this show. And yeah the first five episodes were really mediocre for me. But then after episode six and after it became better and better and better... until I ended up loving it. It's not really the theme of this series that gets you. It's the adorable characters (especially the protagonist with an excellent Danny Glover in the role) and the social messages that this series gives without being boring or predictable. In a length of 10 episodes it talks about music as a way of expression, about the social problems that black people may come across even in 2017's America but also bout the problems that anyone can face in his life like acceptance and the need for love and acknowledgement. And all of this with a smart bitter-sweet humor that makes you want for more. If you get over the first five episodes which are not something really special then you will have a really good time with this show. I can't wait for the next season!",2017
10,"Wow, just wow. This was one of the most amazing TV shows i've ever seen. Just the way it's written and the acting is absolutely top class.

The characters were very well developed, and the idea was amazing. ",2016
10,"If you already know who Donald Glover is than you already know this show is going to be funny, nuanced, intelligent and captivating. You also know he isn't Danny Glover's g0dd@mn son.

You may know the singer Childish Gambino"", or heard him on the radio and didn't even know it, or just have seen Donald Glover on a number of shows, but to really understand him watch one of his stand-up specials on Netflix and I doubt he is not entertaining/hysterical/thought provoking to many people. He comes across with a realness and genuine quality that is hard to find in comedy and when you see his repertoire of talents it hard to see them, stand back and just wonder how many things will this man produce in my lifetime (I'm 34).

The plot of the show was also really good. I had been looking for a show like this for a while now and I was really pleased when I discovered it. I was hooked and watched it in less than a week. It has fresh ideas and funny moments and characters. It's way different than all the other shows that are running. If you're looking for something that has comedy, sarcasm, drama but also somewhat criticizes some of our society's aspects, you'll love this show.

 Well, it's like the upside-down of that haha, you can see a very irrevent parody of that reality with some little touches of drama behind. ",2018
3,"What is the message of this show? The main character is a total loser. He's not a loser in the way that he can't help it, he's just a loser because he refuses to accept reality. It's also ridiculous to see his parents not helping him out, something that tends to happen a lot in America that bothers me. There are some other things that I would like to say, but won't because it isn't politically correct, but the whole show makes certain people look really bad, and it's not the right image people across the world should be seeing.",2018

I'm still not sure what happened.",2017
7,"It started off brilliantly and I really enjoyed the first 3 episodes though they are a little short for my liking. The stories don't really get fleshed out enough in thirty minutes can sometimes be a little thin, but I suspect there are parameters the producers have to work with and it's not to bad. Subsequent episodes really are diminishing in appeal and the brilliant creativity is gradually being replaced with a quirky framework that simply doesn't work as well. I think the initial premise for the show was very good but now that all the preconceived material has been used up, the producers are scratching around for ideas. ",2017

Watched this off of my DVR recently, really not expecting much. Honorable mention to Kendrick, she was really good in her role and the chemistry between her character and Christians was palpable. There are honestly no bad actors in this film but Ben knocks it out of the park. So intense and over the top was his performance, exactly what it needed to be, I was mesmerized. Oscar worthy, in my opinion, an acting master class.",2017
9,"When it released in theatre i dismissed it thinking it might be another dull movie on an accountant. I thot another Bourne rip off or shaky cam stuff. Boy i was so wrong. This movie is a very good drama/thriller. Saw this recently on a rented DVD. Affleck stars as The Accountant who has some dark secrets and illegal dealings. He had a rough childhood as an autistic kid who was raised by his army dad who made sure that his kids learn military training n Indonesian martial arts so that they r not exploited. Affleck credibly adopted the traits, behaviors and symptoms of autism. His performance was very good. The movie starts slowly but its not boring. There is sufficient character development n the story has good amount of twists n turns. There are several intersecting story lines in this film and one branch of that is the federal department tracking The Accountant. There is ample amount of action, both gun firing n hand to hand combat. The headshots r brutal, the body count is high n the movie ended well leaving room for a much needed sequel. But it is not ur typical action like John wick or The Equalizer. Thankfully it is not shot in hand held camera a la Jason bourne n Taken style jus to make it appear fast paced. The movie is engaging n entertaining. The suspense n tension is maintained throughout. Director O'Connor succeeded in normalising autism and showing that behavioural conditions should not get in the way of anyone's life.",2017

8,"Gavin O'Connor, the director of my favorite movie Warrior. Ben Affleck, the once ridiculed but now stupendous entertainer. J.K. Simmons, the distinguished actor from Whiplash. Jon Bernthal, the rising star from The Walking Dead who's a known but yet still unknown actor, and he's great by the way. John Lithgow, an actor who delivers uncanny especially when he's the villain. Bill Dubuque, who the hell is this guy, but he wrote this movie, and this appears to be his first major project besides Robert Downey Jr's The Judge. I enjoy all of these people's work one way or another. This movie has a good director, good leading man, and an all-star cast. From the trailers, this movie seemed like an intellectual movie about a young boy growing up with mental problems, the boy grows up and becomes an accountant, through his work he does business with shady characters, for some reason his clients want him dead, but we know The Accountant is far more capable of much more than they know. I was anticipating this movie based on all the information I just provided. I thought this movie couldn't miss. Is The Accountant a good movie? The Accountant is a good movie.",2016
7,"Christian Wolff (Ben Affleck) is an efficient accountant that is usually hired to find financial deceptions and embezzlement for criminal organizations. His point of contact is a woman's voice by phone and the means of payment are sometimes valuable paintings or gold bars instead of money. Christian was an autistic child that received a rigid military training with his brother Braxton from their paranoid military father. The director of the Treasure Department Raymond ""Ray"" King (J.K. Simmons) has been unsuccessfully hunting The Accountant for a long period and he blackmails the efficient analyst Marybeth Medina (Cynthia Addai-Robinson) to identify who he is before his retirement. When the accountant Dana Cummings (Anna Kendrick) finds an embezzlement of 61 million-dollars in the Living Robotics, Christian is hired to audit the company by the owner Lamar Blackburn (John Lithgow) and his sister Rita Blackburn (Jean Smart). The financial director Ed Chilton (Andy Umberger) tells that Dana committed a mistake but soon Christian checks the books and confirms the embezzlement. During the night, Chilton is murdered as if he had committed suicide and Lamar finishes the audit affecting Christian that have not finished his work. Soon Dana and he are hunted down by hit men and Christian protects her. Meanwhile Median finds his true identity and Christian is hunted by Ray and the FBI. Who might be the person behind the embezzlement? ",2017
9,"This film connected with me on so many levels. It delivered in ways I was not expecting. I was laughing, cheering, crying, and ultimately walked out of that theater feeling more than satisfied. I want to go see it again. Something that is great about this film is that there are things you will pick up on more clearly through a second viewing, but it is not required to fully enjoy the film. Like I said in my title, I can say without a shadow of doubt that this film is better than any other film released this year. However, I will follow that by saying I have yet to see ""Hell or High Water"". So it's more like 99.9% sure. We will see how it holds up against the remaining anticipated releases. I do honestly believe it should be nominated come award season. This film is phenomenal and if you do not see this film before you die, you are doing yourself a disservice.",2016
10,This is a wonderful movie. A lot more of an action flick than title suggests. Was a pleasant surprise as plot unfolded. Ben Affleck is perfect for this part.

10,"I have watched the Jason Bourne sagas for years. James Bond movies have been a mainstay since I was in my teens. Ben Affleck, as an actor, was average at best. With that said, I was somewhat skeptical when the trailers were first released about ""The Accountant"". My curiosity got the best of me. So I went to see it at a matin√©e. IT WAS SO GOOD!!!

9,"I don't usually say this about Ben Affleck movies but the acting was pretty great all the way through. Even Affleck himself gave a great performance; in order to pull this off had to make an autistic man seem human, caring, relatable and even sympathetic...something he did with subtle expression and timing. I wasn't expecting a lot maybe.. but I was pleasantly surprised by this film. I gave it a 9 because I can't think of a way to have really made it a better story or gain a better performance out of the players. It was entertaining and that is all I really see movies for... good entertainment.",2017
7,"Ben Affleck's acting resurgence of the last few years (Argo, Gone Girl, his take on Batman) notches up another tick in the box, this time with an introspective and multi-layered turn as the titular black-market bookkeeper who battles autism, assassins and federal agents. An intricately woven thriller boasting multiple twists and turns‚Äîof varying predictability‚Äîthere's enough meat on the narrative bones to compensate for the over-utilisation of rote flashbacks and the occasional slip into genre clich√©. The autism angle certainly lends a fresh viewpoint on old tropes but the film never feels completely confident to commit, becoming selective about when it depicts the mental condition warts-and-all and when it tames it down to suit the scene. That's possibly an unfair criticism though as this movie is an action-thriller first and foremost, and a damn good one at that. The set pieces are a mix of scrappy hand-to-hand fights, √† la the Bourne series, and gunplay that emphasises practicality similar to that displayed in John Wick; combining to create sequences that are both brutal and stylish. Thankfully the editing isn't as impatient as it can be in a lot of action flicks, with shots held on the recognisable actors just long enough to convince you they're doing their own stunts, whilst the booming sound design gives the sniper scenes an extra bit of chest-pummelling oomph. It's a shame the otherwise exciting finale is at times lit so dimly it's like you're viewing it with sunglasses on, as it detracts slightly from what could have been an epic climax. But hey, that's a minor quibble. Sharing the screen with Affleck, Jon Bernthal's wild streak comes out to play in another menacing badass role and J.K. Simmons is dependably magnetic as a lead agent with a secret past, however Anna Kendrick's kooky numbers cruncher seems to have walked in from a completely different movie (Pitch Perfect 3 perhaps?). It's by no means flawless, yet the high calibre action, gripping central performance and a few plot-based surprises make The Accountant a largely satisfying cinematic outing.",2016
4,"This movie has a lot of flaws. The script is rambling, the sequencing not coherent, the portrayal of autism stereotypical and, worst of all, it has Anna Kendrick in it.",2016

10,Never in my wildest dreams...,2017
1,"I don't know if the 8/10 9/10 ratings are given by bots. Lame 'old brothers unite' drama wrapped in the name of autopsy, math genius, Lewis Caroll, some accountancy angle, money laundering etc. Oh I forgot more ingredients : martial arts, soap opera styled back stories, and for once I heard the names 'taliban' and 'al qaeda' too. And what do all these words add up to. You would assume they would add up to something really interesting and thrilling. But it turns out, the movie could have still been made without calling on these crutches. That is because the movie is all about a gentleman accountant who can and does live a dual life. He helps average organization siphon off money to Panama, and bring them back. His clientele includes some of the most dangerous organizations today. And when he's been summoned by a certain robotics company to look into its books ever since some accountant lady found a possible anomaly, turn of events lead him to realize that the anomaly was indeed present in the books and that the motive was to evade tax, bring it back by short circuiting through Panama and take the company public. Exactly the kind of work he had been helping his clients with thus far. The audience is never given a convincing reason why would the owner call on a genius accountant if all he wanted to do was cook his books. Meanwhile, the accountant is asked to abort his analysis. Very soon we see hit-man of the robotics owner chasing the accountant who happens to remember his martial arts lesson very well and we are given flashbacks to his childhood which are not exactly necessary I'd say. Autopsy has no role to play here. He could have been any other character well trained in martial arts and genius at math. That is where the script scores negative points. Old fashion with new age packaging doesn't sell. Even if it does, the customer feels shortchanged in the end. Picture this : In the closing scene - how I wished that 'that' was the closing scene - the autistic Ben Afleck who we are made to believe is on the 'good' side, faces off with the final security guard of the robotics owner. Ben mumbles some rhyme which he'd been doing since childhood. The security guy hears something ring in his brain. They, well, talk in the heat of the moment. They understand that they were brothers. Yes you read that - they were brothers! Hurray they unite. The robotics owner watches all this with paranoia through surveillance camera feed as do the viewers in the cinema hall. He rushes to the scene. And again, they talk. How loosely scripted you'd say. Just to remind the viewers that Ben has autopsy, he shoots the robotics owner who was delivering a lecture on philanthropy, very abruptly. I was eager to set afoot and out the hall in a flash. But I was in the middle of the row and had to go through some 10 minutes more where I seriously don't even remember what they were showing. They could have brought it all to an end after the lecture on philanthropy ended. I wouldn't have been so worked up had the movie been sans all the adjunct accessories like autopsy, Lewis Caroll etc.",2016
10,"I love a good thriller, action film, mystery or any combination of the three. When you can not only join those three together but add a new twist to it, something not done before, it makes it even better. So it is that I can't recommend the movie THE ACCOUNTANT enough.",2017
1,"This has to be one of the worst films I have ever seen, there is terrible wooden acting from Affleck, who cant seem to remember that is he supposed to be autistic and when he does remember, doesn't seem sure what that even means, Kendrick is so miscast that it is distracting, john Lithgow is completely wasted. It consists of a confusing pointless plot that rambles off into bedtime story type monologues which will have you nodding off. There was a half decent premise here and it was the first casualty in this awful attempt at an action hero thriller. The last 5 minutes are so bad as to be laughable! Do not watch this if you have even a minimum amount of self respect and value your time, do your laundry instead! I fail understand why it has been rated 7.5!?!?!?",2016
9,"I had high hopes for this movie because of Robert Zemeckis, Brad Pitt, and Marion Cotillard. I definitely went into it prepared for a WWII movie, full of action and special effects. And to be clear, this movie certainly DOES have action and special effects (what Zemeckis film doesn't?), but it goes beyond that. ",2016
6,"'Allied' has garnered a mixed reaction, on IMDb and with critics in general. This is completely understandable, and the mixed reaction and the reasoning for it mirrors my own feelings for the film. 'Allied' is not a bad film, but from seeing the trailers (which strongly suggested a film that would be more epic, more moving and more thrilling) to be honest was expecting a lot more.",2016
5,"I always thought of Robert Zemeckis as a hit or miss director. I hated Beowulf but I loved Death Becomes Her for instance. Allied falls right in the middle. An old fashion WWII drama and when I say old fashion I mean, musty, tired. Mr and Mrs Smith territory but with the major plus of Marion Cottillard. She is wonderful. Brad Pitt, who I love, looked like a special effect and being in a Robert Zemeckis movie I thought that he might be. Very strange. The simple premise of discovering that your spouse is not who you thought she was, opens a world of dramatic opportunities but there is something about Robert Zemeckis that makes me think he doesn't really care about the human interaction, no. he seems, always, much more focus in the special effects. Allies is no exception and in fact it has a couple of breathtaking visual coups. Unfortunately the actual drama left me completely cold.",2018
8,"A Franco/Canadian secret mission is an unusual twist for a WWII story. This and the setting of the first part of ""Allied"" reminded me of ""The English Patient"". Canadian Max (Pitt) is sent to Casablanca for a dangerous mission. Marianne (Cotillard) is the French agent already in place to help him.",2016
5,"There was no plot twist although there were several places for a plot twist. If you saw the trailer, you saw the movie. Also, the break from the period setting to give modern values with no point. The introduction of a sister to Brad Pitt's character, who is openly a lesbian. This would NEVER happen in the 1940s as homosexuality was against the law and they were greatly disdained by the public. It is a completely pointless distraction from the period setting. Another goof, German Army officers wearing Nazi armbands. I was beginning to think Quinton Tarantino made this movie. Another example of how Hollywood cannot make a period movie without sabotaging their own production.",2016
3,"The Academy Award-winning 1942 motion picture Casablanca has become a legend of filmmaking, almost a part of folklore, by being as perfect a movie as is possible.

2,"This movie has it's entertaining moments but is generally pretty bad. Totally lacking any tension the scenes are predictable and don't connect well to each other. The script is awful, almost laughable. The stereotypical British characters are embarrassing in a 4 weddings + funeral kinda way. The lesbian couple are pointless and seem to be thrown in there for PC reasons. Why does Brad Pitt turn into a mannequin every time he is introduced to people? The plot is full of holes...why did the German officer rush off to make a phone call instead of arresting Max Vatan?...why would 2 dynamic and ruthless killers be allowed to lounge around London for a couple of years? Surely they could have been useful in North Africa or Italy!...How was Beausejour allowed enter Britain, only for the British to later discover she was dead? So much for their Gibraltar station!...why, upon discovery, was she not used as a double agent, bearing in mind it was 2 months before D- Day? Now that could have been interesting!",2016

3,A movie directed by Robert Zemeckis. Starring Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard. The movie tells us a story of agents who met on a mission to kill German Ambassador in Casablanca during World War II and fall in love. After returning to London their relationship is tested. It was boring and predictable movie. I couldn't see the chemistry between main characters. And I was feeling a lack of something in the whole movie. I was expecting a lot from it but I was disappointed.,2017
6,"Pros:All actors are talented.Good story plot.smart conversations.good camera work. great war effects.Cons:somehow director failed to put you in the atmosphere of the 2nd war era, you still can feel like modern times.movie is a stereotype of showing a western agent kill many German soldiers like James Bond style is absurd & silly. in reality Nazi soldiers were very skilled and hard to beat whether by hand combat or by exchange shooting. so when are Hollywood going to stop underestimating human mind? Worst part of this movie is director attempting to shove the gay-lesbianism in the movie by showing two women openly living together in a lesbian setup, which was not possible in the 40s as society was not (yet) tamed to accept these affairs socially. A classic Hollywood notorious move to naturalize gay-lesbian affairs in history by re-writing history so that our new generations would accept this non-natural affair into their lives. So for straight people please be aware of this point.",2017
5,"This film has a powerful story, many stunning scenes, and Marion Cotillard. But it also has Brad Pitt. Big mistake. Not only does Pitt seem to have had his face worked on, so that it can show little emotion anymore, but he is also apparently not Brad Pitt anymore. Is this a zombie who has taken his place? He plays opposite Marion Cotillard in countless intimate scenes, she tries every device she can think of to wake him up, but still he slumbers. A cardboard cutout of the Brad Pitt we used to know would have been more effective. Considering that this is a film wholly dependent upon the relationship between Pitt and Cotillard, the result is a disaster. The chemistry between them is so far below absolute zero that we are in a deeply frozen universe. Meanwhile, an enormous crew and the director Robert Zemeckis (famous for FORREST GUMP and BACK TO THE FUTURE) struggle to hold back the Red Sea so that the entire cast do not drown in a sea of indifference. We have the excellent Jared Harris, beloved of all MAD MEN fans, adding his resonant voice which is as soothing as hot chocolate, but lacking closeups, so that we can barely see him. We have Gary Sinese, an old chum of Zemeckis. We even have Simon McBurney. But still there is no thaw. We have great scenes. There is sex inside an old car in the middle of a sandstorm in the desert (lacking however any continuity link to the succeeding scenes, which is both an editing and a directing lapse). There is a birth of a baby in the open in the middle of an air raid. There is a man landing on a sand dune by parachute, seen from the air as he descends (astonishing camera work) which is ostensibly in Morocco but was really filmed in the Canary Islands, where all the North African locations were simulated. (There are in any case no such sand dunes near Casablanca, just for the record.) And there is a plane coming straight at a house but which misses its roof by a whisker and crashes across the street. That street is Willow Road in London's Hampstead, where so much action takes place. I could not make out whether the house was meant to be that of my friend Rupert Sheldrake, but I must go have a look at his roof to see whether it is damaged. Later when we see baby Anna taking her first steps, with the wrecked German plane in the background, it is on a hill far from Willow Road, but then this is only a movie. This is a film which should have been fantastic. But it has no pace, it is in fact languid and lingering. It is meant to be a powerful thriller and intense personal drama, but where is the editing to keep it going, where are the intense angles, and above all, where is the hero? Sound asleep, of course. Yes, there are plenty of spectacular setups. Many people worked their butts off giving us great sets, great props, great clothes, wonderful period cars. There are searchlights and anti-aircraft guns slaving away for our benefit, there are Sten guns, Nazis, stern 'V Section' spooks, uniforms, pistols, the whole shebang. But where are the pace, the intensity, and the excitement? All the elements are there, but we wait in vain for it all to move us. This is a passionless film. I also think Steven Knight's screenplay was greatly lacking in any true cinematic sense, and that he is just not a natural writer for the screen, despite having numerous credits. What a waste of a wonderful opportunity this is. And all that money spent on it! Zemeckis rolls scene after scene onstage as if he were producing a variety show in a theatre, or reading from Steven Knight's shopping list, and expects them all to adhere. But they are episodic rather than unified. We go from one outstanding setup to another. But we do not do so quickly enough, there is not enough glue, and above all, the nearest thing to a meaningful Pitt which we see in this film, vaguely and in the distance, are the ones on Jared Harris's face, remembered from MAD MEN, where we all learned to find them endearing marks of his individuality. Marion Cotillard deserves an Oscar for trying. But she might as well be kissing a film poster, and even a rag doll would be more responsive to her embraces. All of her plentiful allure is just so much water thrown at the desert sands, disappearing instantly and leaving no trace. If one pretends all the flaws are not there, one can still just about enjoy this film because of its dramatic and tragic story. But its lack of vigour just makes it look so contrived.",2017
6,"Greetings again from the darkness. Every writer, director and actor dreams of being part of the next Casablanca ¬Ö a timeless movie beloved by so many. It's rare to see such a blatant homage to that classic, but director Robert Zemekis (Oscar winner for Forrest Gump) and writer Steven Knight (Dirty Pretty Things, Eastern Promises) deliver their version with an identical setting, nearly identical costumes, and the re-use of a song (""La Marseillaise"") which played such a crucial role.",2016
6,"This movie seems like a long montage, you never feel engaged with the characters or the story as it races through plot points then plods through others. The effects seem dated, in that it's noticeably fake, which often draws you out of the story. Cotillard is strong, Pitt less so. The story itself has been done and and done better. The writing is a little lazy and predictable. One strange inclusion is that it makes a point of introducing Pitt's character's sister. She seems to serve no point and it feels like something is missing. As a (Southern Hemisphere) summer ""blockbuster"" it will probably fare well but when compared to some of 2016's more tense and visually appealing movies, like Norturnal Animals, it falls flat.",2016
8,"Director Robert Zemeckis gives us some breathtaking moments in ""Allied"" from 2015. The film stars Brad Pitt and Marian Cotillard as Max and Marianne, two spies who meet on a joint assignment in France and fall in love. Mission accomplished, Max proposes. She is allowed to come to England and marry him, and they have a beautiful daughter.",2017
7,"Quite the duplicitous plot! Robert Zemeckis' Allied released by Paramount Pictures is a thrilling tale of espionage and love. We have certainly seen a few different ""spy"" movies over the last couple of years; some more about espionage and others more about the drama that ensues afterwards. Fortunately, Allied feels like a genuine spy movie that actually contains espionage. The production design and costumes are a beautiful throwback to the fabulous 40s. You'll find yourself reaching for a glass of champagne and swing dancing to Benny Goodman's timeless big band jazz hit Sing, Sing, Sing. There is one city synonymous with WWII, espionage, and romance and you will appropriately return to that iconic city of Casablanca in Allied. This is definitely not a reimagined Casablanca but there are indirect references to that movie sprinkled throughout this new story. Films like this one require top notch talent, and both Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard deliver outstanding performances to accompany this staple in film genres. Not limited to the love story between Pitt's and Cotillard's respective characters, the movie also includes some deadly shootout scenes and dangerously close encounters with the Nazis behind enemy lines.",2016
3,"This is the kind of film I go in to with a very forgiving attitude. Historical dramas are among my top choices and it was fantastic watching two of my all-time favorite stars trying to play multi-layered characters and doing pretty good. Then Zemeckis decided to add coke heads and other modern Hollywood projections in scenes of WW2 Britain. Not only was the language, behavior and attitude not historically accurate, it was so distracting and unnecessary in a period piece. Beautiful cinematography and set pieces and a good story all ruined by a need to desecrate old, traditional behavior and values. And by the way, people in the 40's rarely said F but here it was in every sentence. Sad and disappointing.",2016
5,"On paper, Allied should be a great movie. You have a bona fide movie star in Brad Pitt as the leading man and a bona fide movie star in Marion Cotillard as the leading lady. Robert Zemeckis is directing and the setting is one of the most interesting times in human history, WWII. Both play secret agents tasked with taking out a Nazi ambassador in one of the most beautiful cities in the world, Casablanca. Somehow this movie that has so many good things going for it finds ways to disappoint despite having a solid first half. This review is going to have a lot to do with the overall intention of a movie and how it relates to the scores I give out.",2016
1,"""Allied' is the anti 'Casablanca'. Robert Zemekis is no Michael Curtiz. ""Allied' begins in Casablanca in 1942. It is a Casablanca made out of full cloth. In 1942, Casablanca was a thriving port city, yet we see camels and nomads dressed as though they're in a Christmas pantomime. We are told after a man, a European man makes love to his wife, he repairs to the roof to cool his libido. Utter rot. This is a Casablanca of a fertile but poetic bent, but hardly factual. Didn't anyone bother to note that the US liberated French Morocco in 1942? Did anyone bother to not put Casablanca close to the Sahara desert? Camels, exotic costume had a more appropriate place in Goulimine,once the prosperous camel market of Morocco. And the tale goes from fancy to silliness as it is obvious from the opening scenes that Cotillard is a German agent.",2016
5,"The film started off well.....even though I knew there would be a plot development coming later regarding the possibility of the wife being a spy for the Nazis. I didn't mind the story of how the two leads got together and ended up in Hampstead in the middle of the war. I didn't mind waiting for the crisis to come up where Brad Pitt doesn't know if his wife is a spy or not. But once it does come up, Brad undertakes some pretty far fetched ventures that could undermine the Allies' security even in order to find out. I was even overlooking that. What finally tore it was the way Brad's wife played by Marion Cotillard handles her own dilemma and crisis. She could have sought help or guidance from Brad OR his superiors, totally versed in the very areas she was struggling with. It indicates that she did not trust her husband in spite of the lovey dovey marriage portrayed. Either that, or she was simply a wimp and a wuss. This made the whole movie rather unbelievable. As for the ending of the film with the letter to her daughter especially, that was superfluous and heavy on the treacle, a very obvious attempt to tug at heartstrings in case the audience doesn't already GET that she really loved her daughter. Last straw, by this time I really didn't care for the film.",2016
9,"My husband and I both enjoyed this movie. It had been a while since we had seen Brad Pitt in a movie and he is an accomplished actor. His costar was beautiful and talented. They made for good eye candy as a couple. There was plenty of action across two different settings and times. It was not predictable or spelt out for you which is often the case with American movies, The English seem to do a better job of allowing the audience to fill in some gaps and silences.

4,"This is a short review. The single most important thing missing from this film is any kind of chemistry between Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard. Without that chemistry, even as a romantic chick flick, this movie fails. Secondly, any student of WWII history knows that the German Blitz over England pretty much ended in May of 1941, and yet this movie has London being blitzed multiple times in 1943. That did not seem likely. On the positive side, there are some nice sets, and costumes, and some moments of tension. But my overall impression is that the movie is a joyless affair, for the actors, and particularly for the audience viewing it.",2016
6,"In a way, this film is a perfect example of form following function. What better way to show how empty and perverse the model scene in Los Angeles is, than to make an empty and perverse movie about it? If Nicolas Winding Refn wanted to make this point, he has made it loud and clear.",2016
2,"This film starts promisingly with an eye-catching and unsettling image: then the first dialogue (or should I say ""direlogue""?) scene starts, and two things happen. One, the dialogue is awful. Two, the instruction in Acting 101 ""Make the most of your pauses"" has been translated here into ""Leave 5 seconds silence before replying to anything which has been said."" The self-consciously clever-dick direction, at its worst, leads to an interminable sequence which is supposed to represent a catwalk show in which nothing happens (and it doesn't happen repetitively, too) for what seems to be half a day. Refn thinks he is being clever in his direction: he isn't.",2016
1,"The Neon Demon seems to be an unsuccessful attempt to animate the daring, scary and high-fashion photography of Helmut Newton from the 1980s. It seems to me that director Nicholas Winding Refn (who has the nerve to leave his monogram NWR throughout the opening and closing credits as though this film was his tribute to himself and his imaginary smoking jacket), fails miserably to enter the over-the-top, sexually tinged world of slick editorial and advertising fashion mags without a clue to its real inner workings or long-standing history and innovation. Just take a look at a Vogue from 40 years ago and you'll see more provocative images--women in bondage, strapped with saddles, sporting sleek prosthetic legs and arms--all the while in stiletto heels and designer clothes. That era, in a gorgeous, and highly controversial manner, broke all the rules in the fashion world. There's been no one like Newton before or since. Certainly not Winding-Refn. My guess is that NWR needed to do some research not just of the fashion world he tried so badly to recreate but of the movies that have dealt so longingly and beautifully with themes such as cannibalism, envy and eternal youth. Try the Hunger with David Bowie and Catherine Deneuve or even Fellini's ""La Dolce Vita"" that introduced us to paparazzi. Those films brought slick, disturbing yet hauntingly beautiful images on screen to create classics that still stand. The world of the Neon Demon has been one that photographers and cinematographers have depicted for decades yet this new film utterly fails to continue that startling tradition.",2016
4,"I was very anxious to see this film and I had high hopes for this one. I'm so disappointed and kind of angry too. Yes - The cinematography is stunning but it is not enough to save this mess. I know so many fans are all about ""some people don't get it, some people can't understand its real beauty and meaning..."" - sorry, but this is NOT a good film. It could have been great, the idea of it is actually good, but very bad executed. ",2016
8,"I wouldn't really recommend The Neon Demon unconditionally to my friends; not because it's a bad film (quite the opposite) but because it's the kind of movie that would inevitably lead some of them to think ""he told me to watch it and said it was great. What kind of freak could possibly like that kind of stuff?""",2016
1,"I pondered giving this movie a 2 but then I realized that there was no reason. A 2 in my my seemed to believe that this movie had a redeeming quality, it doesn't. While the title to my review sounds like it could be interesting, don't be fooled, even the art isn't worth seeing. The transitions are poor and create a choppy film, each scene lasts 5 minutes too long because it's all about the artistic flair and the art is abstract at best. The soundtrack is even as pretentious as the artistic flair of the movie. No redeeming qualities. The acting is absolutely terrible. The main characters boyfriend literally just stares and delivers a couple line, then stares more. He looks like an absolute creep at the best of times, but that's something that really plagues this whole movie. Someone speaks and then it's like they want to capture every angle of it'll leaving us with a 30 second shot of 2 words. You sit and stare and wonder if it will ever change because dear god this isn't how dialogue works and then it cuts to another scene that has nothing to do with it. While I'm sure that there is some deeper meaning behind the movie, I'm not willing to suffer through it again in hopes that I can rip it from the movie. Any meaning, is so far hidden underneath a gilded scene that it exhausts you hoping that what you're watching is actually about something. I was rather excited that the movie would be tastefully non-nude as it seemed like this could be the type of movie that quickly turns into a porno. While half the movie persisted with it's pleasant non-nude view, it quickly changed with the necrophilia scene and just goes down hill. I don't need to watch two girls showering in blood over and over for 5 minutes. Once again, another ""Artistic"" design, taking double, triple, quadruple the time trying to create a uselessly artistic shot. This film, in all honesty, is just garbage. It has no vision outside of someone screaming ""ART!"" at everyone involved. The dialogue is unnatural and delivered by uninspired actors. Nothing moves along at any sort of pace and whenever it changes scenes it uses terrible cuts and you may not even see the wrap up of the last scene. Save your time, it looks like it may be cool, but it's not. It's a movie that leaves you sitting there wondering what the hell you're watching. If you manage to make it to the end, all you feel is regret.",2016

2,"As a viewer who has enjoyed a handful of Nicolas Winding Refn's works like Drive, Bronson, Valhalla Rising, and even Only God Forgives ‚Äì which I defended wholeheartedly in a 2013 Amazon review ‚Äì it pains me a little to kick off my review with the following statement: It is difficult to decide what I dislike most about Nicolas Winding Refn's The Neon Demon. Critics giving Demon positive reviews and arguing that its monomaniacal focus on style is intentionally on par with the film's message are missing the reality that NWR's creative juices are simply dried up at the moment.",2016

1,"So I guess female vanity is some kind of dark magic and you see the innocent virgin attracted to its glowing allure. As she is drawn into it she meets a coven of witches: a passover, a wannabe and a sorceress supreme, who all covet what she has. The passover wants to kill her, the wannabe is jealous of her and the sorceress supreme who occasionally turns into a wildcat attempts to seduce her, but, awake to the power within her, the innocent virgin instead opens herself to her destiny as the vessel of 'The Neon Demon'. The coven then kills her and eats her flesh to gain for themselves the powers of 'The Neon Demon'. Which is female vanity or the male gaze or some nebulous cloud of similar tropes referenced in terms of fashion modelling. ",2016
9,"Nicolas Winding-Refn is a director who defies all analysis. Most considered him a surefire ""Commercial Success"" following on from his exceptional adaptation, Drive back in 2011.

1,"I have enjoyed most of the Nicolas Winding Refn films I've seen. I love both Bronson and Drive. I tried to like Only God Forgives, but couldn't. I came into The Neon Demon with neutral expectations. I walked out of the end credits disgusted with myself for not having left sooner.",2016
1,"I'm not sure how this has an average rating of 6 stars. There's basically no dialogue, no rhyme or reason to any of the characters or plot, terrible acting, no emotions, no action, no anything.",2017
3,"I do not mind a dark movie if it has a real plot and substance. This movie started off interesting, although there were some scenes with major flaws. However, it then turned into an extremely strange and disturbing film. It was as though the writer(s) hit writer's block and just decided to write sick scenes and put them altogether for merely shock value to keep the audience's attention until the end. The only thing good were some visuals.... Except for the disturbing scenes. The acting was okay. The reactions the actors had to certain occurrences were so unrealistic. It was laughable. I am so sad I spent money to see this movie. I wouldn't have even watched if it was for free.",2016
9,"I cannot understand all the hatred for this movie. Nicolas Winding Refn bounces back from Only God Forgives with this dark, twisted and nightmarish horror film about a young model in Los Angeles who attracts fascination and unwanted attention from the modelling industry and her fellow models. Admittedly, it's only a good movie on a story level. The plot is relatively thin and the characters are underdeveloped. As a piece of art it's an utter knockout. Every single frame is a painting and every image advances the story forward and creates new meaning. This isn't a narrative film. It's a film to experience and to be amazed by. This is a rare movie where being style-over-substance is brilliant because the style is the substance. The artistic mastery on display here takes you on a roller coaster ride of emotions. This movie will have you feeling joyous one moment and terrified the next. The soundtrack is absolutely flawless as well. Elle Fanning is great and all the actors do a good job with their limited dialogue. Even Keanu Reeves is decent in this movie. A flawed masterpiece, The Neon Demon is a mesmerizing, hypnotic and mind-blowing cinematic nightmare that stands high above most of 2016's other films, even though quite a lot of people disliked it.

It's one of my favourite movies of the recent years and I have watched it many, many times now. I am not going to watch The Neon Demon again. Ever. In fact, I'm trying to wash some of its images out of my mind. ",2017
5,"Sometimes you need a little bit more than beautiful visuals. The film does indeed look great, with a superb soundtrack as well. The lighting and use of colour is very NWR.",2016
2,"I watched this primarily because the cinematography did look visually stunning and creative, giving that the trailer didn't show much about the film. Unfortunately, right from the start there was no visible plot. Granted, I actually do enjoy plot less films, but the dialogue and acting have to really make up for it, and in this case neither did. The script is unbearable. I'm not sure what Refn was aiming at, message wise, or if he was making a statement about the fashion industry overall. It was somewhat unsettling to have a male directly with nearly an all female cast trying to say something about women in this industry and society overall. I understand excessive gore but the blood and antics in here really had no significance. As usual, it was disappointing to see a film like this use lesbian sex scenes purely for ""artistic"" purposes. There was unnecessary fetishization and misrepresentation as a whole. It was a shame that Elle Fanning was in this because I can see she has talent. 2/10 with an extra point for the cinematography.",2016
5,"An absolutely stunningly pretty movie, with no substance. Each shot is poised for elegance and beauty, each interaction with the main character is tense and feels ominous, with a very steady build up ultimately leading to nothing unfortunately. The ending is dissatisfying, given the build up, although it is expected through out the movie as it doesn't really feel like its trying to go anywhere in particular. Sometimes its aiming for psychological thriller, other times horror, other times pure drama. The main characters transformation is strong but doesn't really feel like horror. Missed the mark, but every second is perfect for a cool desktop background",2017

6,"Eighty American workers in Bogota get locked inside their office building and an announcement over the intercom gives them half an hour to kill any two of the employees. When they don't comply, the rules are amped up, and an American Battle Royale (down to the 'collars') ensues. ",2016
6,"The set up for the movie had a somewhat interesting concept at its core: what do people do when they are trapped in a situation where the only way out is to kill others? Not a completely original idea, but it has some potential to be thought provoking if there is some kind of message it is trying to send, or some aspect of society it is trying to satirize. The resulting bloodbath is well executed, if you are into seeing office workers murder each other. I can't tell if the movie has a messed up sense of humor, or if a few people in the theater with me just thought some of the deaths were so ridiculous it was funny. Personally I never found any of the deaths over the top ENOUGH to truly find them funny, so the other people's laughter just kind of made me uncomfortable... After the bloodbath ends though, ultimately there was nothing there, no deep thoughts, no important message, no point at all really. The closest thing I can up with for meaning in the movie is that in the end, they basically admit there was no real reason for the experiment to be conducted, and so conducting cruel experiments without a purpose is a bad thing? But that seems obvious, right? When chaos ensues, different people react in different ways. It's sort of like the Walking Dead in that sense, but the Walking Dead has time to develop its themes and characters long enough for you to extract some meaning. In a way, the pointlessness of the experiment and the killing is reflected in the pointlessness of the movie itself. I don't know if that's kind of meta, or just a waste of time, but yeah, if you skip this movie, you won't be missing much except seeing a lot of talented actors who always play supporting roles murder each other in the center stage. If you want to see John Ghallager Jr in something better, watch Hush, or The Newsroom. If you want to see Meryl from the Walking Dead, watch The Walking Dead. If you want to see the ideas this movie brings up actually addressed in a thought provoking way, maybe try the Hunger Games, or Battle Royale. This was a fun little film that ultimately means very little.",2017

The film is really filled to the brim with brilliant possibilities. But for the most part, they remain just possibilities. I do think this is a really good script. However, I don't think the execution of this screenplay was as good as if could've been. The characters making decisions and breaking off into groups could have been fascinating and riveting, but it didn't reach the level it should have. The actual streaks of killing could have been so cool to watch, but it comes off as kind of dull. Where the action could have been really inventive and insane, in a Kingsman: The Secret Service kind of way, it ends up being rather rudimentary and bland.

6,This review of The Belo Experiment is spoiler free,2017
8,"The concept of director Greg McLean and producer/writer James Gunn's THE BELKO EXPERIMENT won't seem overly original to those who've seen BATTLE ROYALE or really any movie in which people are forced to hunt or kill folks they know and like, but in Gunn's hands it's a whole lot more fun: office workers for a Bogota-based non-profit are trapped in their shiny office tower and told by a mysterious intercom voice that they've got to murder a certain number of their own before a pre-determined deadline or double that number will be killed via the company's ""alternate method"". To prove the seriousness of the situation, several employees' heads are suddenly ripped open by a mysterious force. After several attempts at teamwork to devise methods of contacting the outside world result in even more bodies as punishment, some of the (literally) more mercenary members of the management team decide that the voice sort of has a point, and set about liberating several handguns from a downstairs vault, not long after other sluggos have raided the cafeteria of its sharpest utensils.",2016
2,"Fist of all, I don't consider this a horror movie. It really doesn't contain those building blocks of a proper horror. It is not even a thrilling thriller. Just a big mass i could not put together. In my opinion, just a producers bad try to use psychology to rise a popularity. Some scenes I found ridiculous and I actually laughed at. Gore and blood is one of the reasons i didn't vote ""awful"". There are grouse moments but as nearly enough to call this at least a good thriller (this movie just cant be a horror). The only frightening scene was the bare ending and that is all! Simply saying, a big miss in imitating a Shutter Island.",2017
4,"The Belko Experiment is a nasty, gory, chaotic little horror film that pits an office building full of co-workers against each other in a bloody battle of last man/woman standing. This much you probably already know from the trailer. It's a plot that can be succinctly surmised on a cocktail napkin so it's not like you need much to prime you for what's to occur. What they don't tell you however is The Belko Experiment is a nasty, gory and chaotic little horror film without a center. Hunger Games (2012) meets Office Space (1999)?

Produced and written by James Gunn, the same guy that can write a fun horror thriller like Dawn of the Dead or Slither (a little grossed out film). The script is able to flash out the characters by giving them characteristics on who they are in the movie and how they will all turn out when everything hits the fan of chaos. The plot follows Mike (John Gallagher Jr.) a regular employee going to work at a Belko company in Colombia. It's a nonprofit government organization that requires employees to get tracking devices implanted in the back of their heads for insurance policies if they were ever to get kidnapped in Colombia. Every one checks in the office like Mike's girlfriend Leandra (Adria Arjona), a new employee Dany (Melonie Diaz), A techie Keith (Josh Brener), a Maintenance guy Bud (Michael Rooker), a perverted office employee Wendell (John C.

5,"After watching I do believe that ""The Belko Experiment"" would've been a much better film overall under the direction of James Gunn. I don't think Greg McLean does full justice to Gunn's script and the ""Experiment"" fell a bit short, at least for me. Its not a bad movie in any aspect but for me it lacked the extra detail and effort to make it something above average. The acting is just fine. Aside from the main character Mike - played by John Gallagher, Jr - who I found a bit cringy and sufferable to watch from time to time - everyone seems to know what they're doing - shoutout to Tony Goldwyn, Adria Ajorna and John C. McGinley who for me, where the best of the bunch. Another big positive for me was the soundtrack. I've grown quite fond of Tyler Bates since watching John Wick 2 and he excels once more at creating tension and urgency. With all of that said, ""The Belko Experiment"" was a bit of a let down - the major plot point was left incompletely unexplained and the sequel? teaser at the end didn't make it for me. They should've been more smart and inventive, otherwise we are only left with an hour and an half of gore just for gore's sake.",2017

It may be that some of the plays are real but if you watch the very first episode, there must be cameras on tracks behind the action and they when we see the same play from a different angle, there should be cameras visible from the opposite angle.

8,"This movie isn't a typical and predictable ""happy ending movie"", however it has many twist plots and is amazingly creative. I loved the idea at the end and how the ending was a bit open, making the audience think a bit for themselves. Frankly speaking, this story throws a bomb at the end as you struggle throughout the whole movie of sudden terrifying scenes, it's all worth it. Jacob Tremblay is an amazingly talented kid and his acting skills slay in this movie, especially in certain scenes. However, I think in some specific scenes, Kate Bosworth's character and her ""husband"", lacked showing emotions. I feel that if a bit more emotions were portrayed from the characters, it would've been much more powerful. Overall, great movie, worth the watch! :)",2016

And if you're like me, it's a very tiring trope. ",2016
7,"Before I Wake tells the story of Cody(Jacob Tremblay). Cody has been moving from place to place because, different foster parents have been adopting him from time to time. Now, he is in the care of, Jessie(Kate Bosworth) & Mark(Thomas Jane). Jessie & Mark soon realize, that Cody's dreams physically appear before them, as he sleeps. The deadly fact is, the same thing happens during his nightmares. ",2016
7,"This movie somewhat reminded me of ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"", a movie that started out like a drama and in the end felt like a fairy tale story. ""Before I Wake"" has the feel of a horror movie at times, but turns into, albeit a scary one, a fairy tale. The good: The actors did a fine job, especially the two leads. A well written story and the fantasy effects looks good. The bad: The monster did not look very scary, but I guess there is a reason for that in the story. The movie is promoted as a horror, I guess that will leave some viewers disappointed. This is not The Conjuring or Saw. This is a fantasy with some scary elements.",2016
7,"Decent movie, it has a couple flaws in the script (which I can't really point out without spoiling stuff so I won't bother doing that) but the resolution was brilliant and Kate Bosworth pulled one of her better performances as of late so it's well worth seeing.",2016
7,"This is a very ""nice"" suspense/horror movie - with a satisfyingly good ending that explains and ties things together neatly. As with most horror movies - i went in without too great an expectation and was pleasantly surprised that i really liked it.",2016
3,I've enjoyed Mr. Flannegan's movies before this one. But right from the start Before I Wake got on my nerves. You've got the perfect couple living in an amazing house without any visible means of support. What do they do for work? The kid is ridiculously adorable mini-Bieber with a cutie-pie pout and way of speaking. Perfect perfect perfect. It's pure Hollywood fantasy.,2016
10,I scored this a 10. Let me tell you why:,2016
8,"The biggest strength of Before I Wake is in my opinion the writing. I was impressed with the story and background of characters from the beginning. Horror films these days, with the exception of a few, don't seem to have plot development beyond a vague explanation. But I appreciate a horror movie that has a strong story element. Flashbacks were used throughout to show reasons behind certain character actions. The story itself is something you'd think is from Stephen King. So if you like that kind of thing this movie is for you. A foster child has the power to make dreams (and nightmares) real. His new foster parents are unsure what's happening when their home starts to become a wonderland of dream creatures..including monsters. The fantasy element colors the movie a much different shade than something like the Conjuring. As it develops, the mysterious circumstances keep you guessing which is fun if you're watching with someone. My girlfriend and I were both trying to figure it out before things were revealed. By the end I was left wanting more and while that may bother some moviegoers, at least it leaves room for a sequel. See this movie if you can and keep an open mind!",2016
7,"This is a film about death--its meaning and how we cope with it. I'm not sure for me that the mix of genres worked. I was mildly disturbed by the horror, occasionally caught up in the wonder, and yet ultimately put off by the cloying sentimentality. It is quite a good movie in many ways: it's superbly acted, and some of the scenes are very original. I just don't think the blend worked for me. For once there was an American child actor who wasn't intensely irritating. He was rather sweet and I wanted him and his little butterfly book to survive. I guess a movie can't be all bad when it makes an impression. I won't ever see Christmas tree baubles in quite the same light again.",2016
6,"Going to the cinema to watch this with a friend is a great idea. This movie was hilarious. The monster looks extremely funny and some scares were just plain funny. The story was interesting even though the dialogues were not so great. The acting was good from all of the actors. Jacob Tremblay was great and cute. Kate Bosworth, I thought she was great. She carried the movie well as this paranoid mother. Thomas Jane was also great as my favorite character from the movie. The theater we watched in was completely empty so we yelled out lots of crap and the movie turned out to be an enjoyable time for us. THe story was interesting. The movie concluded with a great ending which I would not spoil. Before I Wake (2016) will give you an enjoyable time.",2016
8,"It is infinitely better to center horror films around flawed, adult human beings, rather than seeing another vapid pretty face slashed by a faceless mook. Filmmakers like Guillermo del Toro (The Devil's Backbone) and William Friedkin (The Exorcist) understood that notion, where human flaws and regrets coil up subconscious fears into horrifying supernatural manifestations. Greenhorn filmmaker Mike Flanagan, who scared audiences with his surprisingly clever Oculus years ago, returns to follow these veterans' footsteps with his flawed but nonetheless human sophomore effort.",2016
5,I would agree with other reviewers that the movie shouldn't be classified as horror.,2016
6,"Based on my thoughts on Occulus and Hush, I've come to expect a great plot and questionable execution from Flanagan's productions and he did not disappoint in this. The heavy reliance on butterflies and a woman coming to appreciate and love a child that's not her own (among other things) reminded me of a better horror movie; Mama. All this did was make me wish I was watching that instead of Before I Wake. But then again, Before I Wake isn't a horror movie and it shouldn't have been marketed as one. The film is one part fantasy, one part drama and one part horror/thriller (whatever you want to call it) but it has a difficult time balancing this out. The script and screenplay is too half-baked to advance the film to the heights it wanted to reach.",2016
8,"I would hardly call it a horror movie. That's a bit misleading. But it sure was a fun supernatural thriller. It had good performances, the kid's included (usually with this type of movies I find myself distracted by the lack of believable performance by the child actors, but not here.)",2016
4,"I thought this movie was very interesting I was right into trying to unravel the3 mystery, gave me a similar vibe like when I first watched the sixth sense, in that I was waiting for a totally unexpected and cleverly planed ending, like when Bruce Willis was the dead man the whole time, those type of films whether horror, thriller, drama are very few and far between, majority of mainstream films are dull and easily predictable, that is why the sixth sense in my is one of the best written movies I've ever seen. The way it was written with such a satisfying and thought provoking ending had me thinking about it for weeks after which has not happened with any other movie. I should add that there may be others out there, and I'm by no means the type of person who watches every movie. The Sixth Sense,was written like a true puzzle that I could not solve, until the unexpected dramatic and satisfying conclusion, which rarely happens in main stream movies. As I said I watched Before I wake and it had my full attention;which rarely happens by the way, I was truly thinking this was going to deliver a twist or unexpected conclusion as to what really happened to the boy or his current foster family. Was he dead? were the foster parents and the boy all dead looking for some kind of answers in there unrest? living in some kind of afterlife dreamland unknowingly? The canker man is actually the boys manifestation of his loving,sick dying mother who had cancer,and he related it to a monster, hence the name 'canker' as he was just a child and wasn't able to fully grasp the concept or read. At this point I thought to myself ""wow this is actually a great and cleverly thought out way of showing how cancer literately eats those we love, and how it is a evil monster(metaphorically) speaking of course, that takes away ""eats"" people, like we see the monster slowly absorb its victims. I started unraveling the story in my head and said, wow that is a unique and interesting way to explain the reality of cancer and how it eats people until they are shriveled and frail, this was going to be a clever and hard hitting story about how cancer metaphorically ""eats"" and ultimately leaves its victims looking like ""monsters"" from a child's perspective,after its wrath. I thought it was going to say the boys mother, step father, bully, were in fact actually eaten, by the hideous real life monster everyone knows by the name of: cancer, from the perspective of a child as he sees cancer as a real monster. Now that would have made this a 5/5 for me, story telling and entertaining and mysterious puzzle all in one. However, Before I wake lacked to deliver any ending, felt as if the writers kind of had a great idea, just didn't quite know how to deliver a good conclusion, as if they said this is good enough, lets just put it out there, a dull ending with no real twist or revel. This could of been great, and it was for the majority of the movie, until the boring and unsatisfying, dull ending. What seemed like a sure firecracker of a movie, however, its inability to deliver any hard hitting explanation or thought provoking twists,made this film a dull and boring dud.",2016
4,"I liked the initial idea, a kid having dreams that represent in real life. Just imagine how far they could have gone with that, with good special effects and photography, and decent acting. Sadly, the only good thing in this movie is the idea",2017
8,"Now as far as I'm concerned when a movie makes me a little disgruntled about the actions of one or more of the characters then it's safe to say the movie has done what it was created to do. Jacob Tremblay is amazing and his perfect little boy with a secret side to him was pulled off incredibly without a hitch ""I'm Sorry"". Now Gorgeous Kate Bosworth was the character who made us cringe to no fault of her own the acting and dialogue from the writers was concise yet riveting. a lot of horror movies talk too much or not enough,a lot of them are non educational or don't offer enough clues to what's happening in their creepy minds as a director, Not the case with Mike Flanagan & Jeff Howard directing answer writing the story is original perfectly Paced with explanation that are surprisingly believable and not following the same lane for ending the movie as 90% of doom & gloom horror movies do. Thomas Jane also should be mentioned for becoming a horror actor with a cult following always amazing his latest role that blew everyone away in ""The Veil"" although this role was less demanding it was good but to him it was a cinch I'm sure of that. All in All the movie got 8/10 from me definitely recommend it. It wasn't the scariest but it was definitely very creepy and it was enough of it through out the whole movie with a good ending. Definitely worth a watch.",2016
6,"And no this is not a criticism of the movie. Nor your reaction to it. While it's hard to tell what qualify as boring for some, I do believe this is decent enough to keep your on your toes (or the edge of your seat/bed), without you being in danger (no pun intended). Which cannot be said about the characters in this one.",2017
5,"This is a horror movie that just about anyone can sit through without it giving them nightmares. So if you wants a very scary and suspenseful scary movie than this movie is probably not for you. When it comes to the story, it's pretty standard. About a haunted boy or girl's past and supernatural stuff going on. Again this isn't a scary horror movie, this one seemed more like a fantasy movie with creepy ghosts. It sort of reminded me of the movie ""The Lovely Bones"" mixed with ""MAMA"" except with a lower budget . Where it leads to it having more heart and touching moments with supernatural elements thrown in. If you have seen horror movies before, there really isn't anything new when it comes to this. I personally found it boring since I have seen everything in this movie done before, except scarier. But if you are looking for a horror movie that the whole family can probably watch without it going overboard with blood and gore, this one might be it.",2016
9,"I watched this movie last week , After watching this movie I really felt that I utilize my free time for a deservedly movie.",2016
2,"As a fan of Gilmore Girls who must have watched the first seven seasons of the show ten times over, I was sorely disappointed by the long anticipated revival of the show in the form of A Year in the Life. ",2016
2,"One of the reasons that the original Gilmore Girls gained such a large following was its fun, organic flow and its fast-paced, witty dialogue. Watching the original series, the viewer was never bored or left wandering. The plot was carefully thought out, processed, contained beautiful highs and lows and intricate twists, and it was uplifting.",2016
5,"Not to start all negative, I really did enjoy myself watching the show. I made a whole evening out of it, drank beer, ate a lot of junk (Gilmore girl style), and it was fun. Stars Hollow has always been my happy place and seeing those Christmas lights light up, and those crazy town festivals really warmed my heart. The Kirk bits were really funny and the Secret bar made me laugh. I think the whole town vibe was on the spot, it really felt like nothing had changed (and that was one of my main concerns before watching it). And now to the negative¬Öthe biggest let down of all was Rory and her character. I mean, it was a total train wreck! Being Rory's age I was always able to identify myself with her, I looked up to this smart girl who knows what she wants from life. She made some mistakes, but was always compassionate and caring. You could really feel the emotion in all 3 of her relationships, they had purpose¬Öit was so sad seeing how they turned her into this heartless indifferent woman with no moral. She has a meaningless relationship with some poor schmuck (forgetting from time to time that he even exists), an ongoing affair with Logan who is engaged to another woman, and a one night stand. Throughout all this her feelings are NOT ONCE addressed. This girl who was so passionate in everything she did suddenly has no emotion at all? The little emotion we get from her is regarding her grandfather and her career. I thought Rory's love life would be the center point of the show, as I am sure most of the fans did too, but it was beyond neglected. The main story is concentrated around Lorelai and Luke, and it made no sense at all since their story has already been told. They forced this cliffhanger between them in episode four which, to be honest, didn't even make me blink. All in all the ending left me with this empty, sad feeling. I've re-watched Gilmore girls multiple times, always dreaming that one day I'll get to watch the show with my own daughter, but I have no desire to watch season 8 again.",2016
1,"Now more than ever I am happy that the cast of Friends never did a reunion. Imagine you would find Joey becoming an addict, Chandler and Monica divorced and Ross cheating on Rachel with a student. This is how you feel after watching the new Gilmore Girls episodes.",2016
2,"As sad as I am to write this, watching this revival was a waste of 6 hours. To be honest it just did not feel the same. All the things we all love about the original Gilmore Girls, like the wit and the homey feeling just were not there. We deserved more and so did the show. First off, I hate how they portrayed Logan and Rorys relationship. While ill admit in the beginning they didn't always have the best relationship, I their relationship deserved more than an affair (which is totally not Rory!). People claim he is her ""Christopher"" while I think that is the farthest from the truth. Out of all her boyfriends it is obvious the love he has for her, how he would go to the end of the world for her, and the biggest attribute that does not make him like Chris is how he is always there for her and is dependable. I think its sad that their relationship turned into what it is when there was so much more love there in the original seasons. I don't think Logan is her ""Christopher"" and Jess is her ""Luke"", because honestly Jess has been irrelevant for such a long time in that show, and in the revival a 5 minute interaction doesn't exactly make them soul mates. I am extremely happy we finally got to see Lorelai's life finally settle down, but what about Rory? To me she has always been just as important. If there was another season at this point I'm not even sure if I would watch it but it would be nice to have some answers because the end felt like the end to season seven and honestly we just deserved more and the characters deserved more.",2016
1,"This contains spoilers, but only of the first episode. I won't watch the rest. I struggled with Lorelai's botoxed and filled face and Luke's fake hair (as if either of those characters would ever have done that!), Lorelai's unforgivable behaviour at her father's funeral, her utter rudeness to the chef at the Inn, Rory sneakily sleeping with Logan, all of their vile treatment of Rory's ""boyfriend"". Not quirky/funny any more, just quite unpleasant. But the whole surrogacy scene with Paris was when it all jumped the shark for me. Horrid, nasty, insulting, and so completely unlikely. 48-year-old Lorelai suggesting a surrogate? Impossible to imagine. I was so looking forward to it. I've been re-binge watching the original series from the start, but I can't even face that any more.",2016
6,"I have been waiting for November 25th to come for a few months now. I wasn't counting down the days like crazy or pronouncing the day a national holiday, I just wanted to see what happens. On the internet, I have come across several comments about season 7, how it is just not worth watching and how evident it is that the Palladinos were no longer part of the show. Personally, I didn't notice any major differences, to me it felt the same. Sadly, I cannot say the same about ""A Year in the Life"".",2016
1,"I'm soooo sad to say I hated it. :( I knew it wouldn't be as good as the original but I was sure I'd still enjoy it. I was wrong. Lorelei and Luke had no chemistry. Rory was the other woman AGAIN while cheating on her own boyfriend whom she kept forgetting existed. What??!! Forgetting her bf for a year? Who thought that would be a good/ funny story line? It was just stupid. Unfortunately, every story line written for every character was a miss. The jokes were flat and 6-hours dragged on painfully. I waited and waited for it to get better. I'm actually a little sad and also surprised at how bad this was. At least I'll always have the original. And on another note, I'm also very surprised at the IMDb rating. 8.5??? LOL! NO way! It's misleading. I don't know anyone who liked it even a little. I see on the site the reviews are mixed but that's a really good score.... Don't believe it!!!!",2016
1,"I have had an addiction to Gilmore Girls for a long time and this has cured it. Everything about the revival was perfect and beautiful except the character of Rory. It was very reminiscent of the episode where Lorelei walks away from being engaged to the love of her life and sleeps with Christopher, or when Rory dropped out of Yale because she believed Mitchum It was senseless and sad. The entire show lost me when Rory slept with a random stranger from the streets of New York. OMG!! I also found it incredible that she never in 8 years did anything toward a masters degree and was wasting her time with Logan while he was engaged to another woman. How depressing was that?! This is the antithesis of the other Rory that we enjoyed watching grow up. Even with Dean, she realized her mistake of being the other woman and was only 19 at the time. Now at 32 she is so off track that she is not even recognizable. Basically, she didn't grow up. OK I can buy that... but they changed her to the inner core, they took away the true self, the moral compass, she comes across as incompetent and immature, and very slutty. All I can say is thank you thank you thank you!!!!!! Now I can stop watching re runs of this show and become a more productive human being. What a gorgeous show full of talent totally trashed by the substandard story line. It reminds me of the presidential election...2016 continues to disappoint.",2016
3,"I am a bigger fan than most of Gilmore Girls. I watched the series while it was still airing and continued to re-watch it every year since. Although it was just a show, it felt like a constant source of comfort that was very relatable. After hoping for a revival for many years, I now wish it had never happened. The only good thing to come out of ""A Year in the Life"" was seeing so many of the original cast members come back.",2016
7,**CONTAINS SPOILERS**,2016
1,"The girl we grew up to love, cheered on, shed tears for, had high hopes for, wanted love, happiness and great success for turned out to be a washed out, sad person void of the self respect, drive, modesty, quiet dignity, moral compass and other desirable personal qualities she once possessed. She is scatterbrained at best, forgetting that she even has a boyfriend of 2 years; forgetting his name. Leaving reminders for herself to break up with him. This is not what viewers really expect from a girl who was more serious about her romantic relationships 15 years ago, as a teenager. And now that Rory is grown up, instead of building a lasting, meaningful relationship with someone who we would have considered worthy of her, she has become a superficial floozy who cares very little about the feelings of others, much less about the value of a committed relationship. This was a girl who was always ""all in"" or ""all out"". Who was hung up on Dean, then Jess, then Dean again. A girl who broke it off with Logan because she was a serial monogamist and could not stand for his need to have an open relationship. This was when she was 19. Fast forward to when she is 32 and now she is suddenly fine with having a casual, ""no strings attached"", ""open"" relationship with Logan, all the while cheating on Logan's soon to be wife. So just to summarize, because this is all fairly complicated for a 4 episode revival. Rory is having an affair with her engaged ex-boyfriend from whom she demanded monogamy 13 years ago preceding a 3 year committed relationship, but now for whatever reason is unable to have a committed relationship with him and decides to help him cheat on his fianc√© instead in a pointless affair that goes nowhere, while stringing some poor guy along for 2 years who thinks she's his girlfriend, while having one night stands. I suppose if Rory's career or life otherwise was in better shape we wouldn't feel so utterly disappointed watching her train-wreck existence. But basically, Rory's career is going nowhere, she is broke, willingly homeless, has no prospects, ends up getting rejected for a job she thought was guaranteed after getting poached for it. Considering by Rory's age, Lorelai had already raised a sixteen year old daughter, had her own home, had built a life for herself within a community and had worked towards running an inn after starting out as a maid, it would seem that Rory's life is a failure by comparison. This makes it all the more sad that Lorelai had such high hopes for Rory and wanted more for her life than what she was able to have, and ironically Lorelai, a high school dropout and teenage mother turned out to be more accomplished and successful than her daughter who she sacrificed so much for to give her a better life. We did not expect the whip smart, well read, ambitious, driven, high achieving Chilton and Yale graduate to fail at life. We wanted to watch her career unfold at the New York Times, we wanted to see her achieve all her goals and dazzle the world with her talents as a wordsmith. The girl who was once obsessed with ""to do"" and ""pro con"" lists, having everything in order and determinedly working towards her goals is a jobless, homeless, aimless drifter living out of boxes scattered around in different people's houses. This is not the Rory Gilmore we know, and not the ending we pictured for her.",2017
1,"What was that???? If you didn't already watch it, DON'T! Do yourself that favor. You will walk away very disappointed. There just didn't seem to be any effort or thought put into this. I loved Gilmore Girls back in the day. But this???!!! Horrible. I wasted enough of my life watching it. Two minutes is all I'm willing to spend on this review. I kept hearing about the cast being reunited but Dean, Jess, Sookie and Jackson were in it for a combined total of about 3 or so minutes IN 6 HOURS! Maybe that wouldn't matter if the overall story was good but it wasn't. I kept waiting for it to get better. I kept thinking ""Maybe when the original characters come into it..."" I hate to say it but it was really bad. Especially anything Rory- related. Forgetting her bf for a year and losing her underwear!? Really? That's the best they could come up with for her? And why is she still sleeping with unavailable men???? Ugh! Overall it's very disappointing and beyond boring. :(",2016
2,"The first 5 minutes of this show was like coming home. I saw real potential, but my biggest let down this year is this series. 4 episodes of people showing up to say hi. Nothing else. Nothing happens. Nothing of meaning at least. It felt rushed and just thrown together. The trailer bit where they comment on Amy Schumer was funnier then this show. Mostly i'm disappointed in what they did with Rory. Last i saw her she was going to cover the campaign for Barack Obama, and now she is a freelancer with no spark. Cheating on her boyfriend with Logan, not having learned anything from the thing with Dean all those years ago. She seems weak. The only story-line I liked with her was that she took over the Stars Hollow gazette. Sookies two-minute pop-up was the highlight of the show. ",2016
6,"Gilmore girls is my all-time favorite show. Quirky, smart, and expertly cast, the original series left us wanting for nothing. This is why I was so hoping that the revival would carry on the original spirit of this modern classic. I was wrong. I didn't want to get my hopes up, because revivals are hardly ever as good as the original, so I came in expecting very little, but at least hoping that it would keep up the original spark of the show. Instead, we got 6 hours of disjointed banter, none of which succeeded in matching the original level of cleverness. Many of the characters, such as Jason, Dean, and Doyle, seemed to have been shoehorned into the script just to check a box. Their interaction with the main characters seemed forced and very scripted, not at all in keeping with the Gilmore banter we have all come to know and love. It seemed as though the writers were so set on having the story come full circle that they forgot that this show is less about that and more about the comedy. We watch Gilmore girls, partly to watch a refreshing, albeit unnatural, mother daughter relationship, but more than that, we watch it to laugh. And the writers seemed to have forgotten that that was what we loved most. More than anything, I was hoping for a better ending to the show than I got in season 7 of the original. I'm not sure I got it. I'm not really sure what I got. All I can say is that I'm left scratching my head. It wasn't good, but it wasn't really bad either. The bottom line is it wasn't Gilmore girls.",2016
4,"First I wanna say that I love old Gilmore Girls. No one, absolutely no one can say a bad word to me about Gilmore Girls... but this new mini-series was such a disappointment! The only parts i liked was first half of episode one and second half of episode four. Everything between was just weird or totally pointless. The musical part? WTF? Or why is Rory such a b*tch. I mean she is totally arrogant, so often... Lukes and Lorelais wedding was not a surprise but it was nice, OK. But what about the end? If there is not going to be any more episodes in future then I don't understand why they even created these four episodes. All episodes are quiet long and in all that time we got to see only short moments with most popular characters. Also, Rory is in a bad place in her live and at the and she just says ,,I am pregnant""... the end. This is the end? We have no idea who the father really is (yeah probably Logan, great). We have no idea what Rory is going to do with her life. And what about Jess... he obviously still loves Rory. There is simply too many questions if these four episodes are supposed to be IT. This end is even worse then the original end in old series. Also Sookie should have been included much much more. Five minutes with Sookie and Larelai was not enough. They had just some obviously cheap reunion after two years. And another thing is... who the f*ck was Paul, why was he even there, why did they keep including him so often. No one is so stupid to keep forgetting to break up with someone... for months! Especially not Rory. It was funny the first time but not later. I just don't know what to think about all this. I was so happy about this and know i am so angry! They just created very unoriginal TV show that has nothing much to do with original Gilmore Girls. If I had a smallest clue about how disappointing this is going to be... i just wouldn't watch.",2016
3,"Ugh, okay, there were parts of this I didn't completely hate.",2016
5,"Luke and Lorelai - after all these years, it's like they didn't progress. The show picked up where we left them, which is completely unrealistic. They would have addressed the baby question waaaay before now. The audience would have been content to find them married with a little kid running around. We didn't need the ridiculous surrogate story line and the over-the-top Paris freaking out. And, come on, Luke isn't stupid. That whole thing was just insulting. I thought Lorelai would have calmed a bit, having found joy with Luke. Nope. Still a flake. Rory - she had progression, but not in maturity or morality. All that time studying at Yale, all those lofty goals and the girl can't find a job? As for her character development, she regressed. She has zero morals and is okay playing mistress to man who is engaged to someone else. Maybe Hollywood thinks that's cool, but here in the real world, we don't. Families are ruined by men and women like her. Trampy, trampy, trampy. Maybe more time in a church and less at Yale would have done her good. Emily - I think they did a great job with Emily. She's the only one I felt was totally back in character and her plot line followed what Emily Gilmore would have done after Richard's death. I completely enjoyed her story. As for the rest - it ended exactly the way I thought it would, which is rather disappointing because I like surprises and originality in my shows. I don't actually care about Rory and the baby. I already know how they'd play that out - the drama with Logan, Logan's dad trying to buy her off, maybe a custody battle. bla bla bla And I don't appreciate the major fan pandering in these episodes. I wanted character and plot development. Throwing in famous chefs and actors from other shows that the cast was in was ridiculous. Glad that didn't cost me money.",2016
5,"Back to Stars Hollow after almost 10 years. A beautiful thought. A risky venture. But one that had every chance of success - gathering most of the original cast, keeping the time frame 'real'.",2016
3,"This was such a huge disappointment. I am a true Gilmore Girls fan and was so excited to see this. I am not sure how I made it through the entire 4 episodes. There was SO much wasted time on inane garbage. I really could not believe they did all that Stars Hollow Play crap in the 3rd episode...I was dumbfounded...and bored beyond belief. Yes, every now and then you caught a little glimpse of the original Gilmore Girls but mostly it was just everyone looking highly uncomfortable and out of place. I even got a little uncomfortable watching everyone struggle to get back into their roles. Lorelai and Rory did okay. Emily, Paris and Logan were the best. This was so, so sad.",2016
5,Spoiler alert but I do not care I stayed up till 4am PT to watch it ,2016
2,"Awful, stupid, ridiculous to sum it up. Rory grew up to be a stupid little _____ that I figured she would turn out to be.. She's an annoying ____ who only thinks of herself. She's still unable to take care of herself and really turned into this annoying character. Throughout half of the show I was debating how much Botox Lauren Graham really got.",2017
2,"Very disappointing!! They focus on people none cares about. They wasted time showing musical, trips or short movies with no added value to the story. (and they are not even funny!!!!) They promised a new series to let people know to answer to unresolved questions of the previous series and they end with even bigger questions!!!! I've been watching those 4 episodes waiting for something to happen to Rory. And it does, but at the very last minute and we don't even know what she is going to do about it. The only part i liked was the one that focused on Emily and on her reaction to what happened, thus 2 points instead of 1. I loved the original series and i watched every episode. I was very excited to see the new series, but i feel like it ruined it. It was pointless, boring and disappointing. I sincerely hope they are not going to make new series again!!!",2016
10,"Gilmore Girls will always have a special place in my heart. It was the show that got me through high school with characters as refreshing and relatable as Lorelai and Rory. The story arcs were captivating and Stars Hollow becomes a distant place you hold dear. If you can't get enough of the Gilmore Girls, the revival is all you could hope for and more.",2016
3,Ugh what a waste of potential. I'm not even bothered by the lack of awesome quips this revival had coz I never expected it to be as good as the series was....,2016
8,"This is a better than average romantic comedy. I gave this one an extra star, because, although it largely followed the rom-com formula, meaning happy endings for most of the characters, it wasn't obvious who was going to end up with who, or otherwise. Rare is the film in this genre that does not telegraph its exact ending at least forty minutes away. Rebel Wilson played to type and was quite amusing. Alison Brie was lovely, and played her neurotic role very well. Dakota Johnson was absolutely adorable. I hope to see more of her in the future. Kudos to Leslie Mann, as well. The New York sets and photography were impressive, and there were no obtrusive directing techniques.",2016
8,"I'll be honest, I was dragged to this movie by a girl friend. I was tired of the rom com genre. I had seen it all before. Ill say this, this movie strips away all those clich√©s and goes in the opposite direction. What a lovely and funny R rated comedy with a lot of heart. There are so many charming moments that I cannot even explain them all. Rebel Wilson does her usual thing but here she perfects it and brings a certain edge to her performance. Its my favorite performance of hers. Dakota Johnson gives the best performance of her young career and Leslie Mann owns her roll. Its her funniest, saddest, and truest performance to date. Yes Im still talking about a raunchy comedy here. There is more to this movie than you might think. The men in the film are actually better written that most clich√©d men in romantic comedies. Finally, the ending is just perfect for those single people out there.I advise seeing this with a friend and not with a significant other. **** out of 5 stars.",2016
7,"A mixed cast out of established actors and ""Newcomers"" aka. ""Isn't that the guy from (insert show-name here)"" loosens up the mood and gives the general idea that the movie doesn't take itself too serious. Creative details like glowing numbers on bottles and texts in the air also contribute to this.",2016
4,"It's risky to title a movie like a self-help book, because the audience may actually expect to learn something by watching the story unfold. The bad news is, if you're seriously looking for a guide on how to be a single lady, you'd gain more by listening to Beyonce. ",2016
3,I am finding that the more movies I watch with Dakota Johnson just leads to disappointment. Is it just me or is there no emotion in her face when she acts. ,2016
1,"My God, what a terrible movie. I know that I shouldn't have high standards when it comes to rom-coms, and trust me mine are super low, but this one hits rock bottom. It is so condescending and sexist that I had a real hard time watching it to the end (I've watched it with a couple of friends so that made me stay). I can actually enjoy trashy films that are so terrible that they are awesome, but this one actually tries to make a point and it fails miserably. The writing is terrible, the acting is terrible, even New York can't help it (and that says a lot). If you are looking for a rom-com, do yourself a favor and skip this one. And then send me a ""Thank you"" note for those 90 minutes of your life that would gone to waste (plus millions of brain cells you would lose in the process).",2016
2,"Many unattached adults find being alone difficult ‚Äì especially on Valentine's Day, so I guess it makes sense that there would be a movie called ""How to Be Single"" (R, 1:50) in theaters starting the second weekend in February. What doesn't make as much sense is using such a title for a movie that is more likely to make many singles feel even worse about not being in a romantic relationship on said holiday.",2016
8,"As suggested above, this isn't the kind of movie that I would watch but, after watching Dakota Johnson In several films and enjoying her work, I thought I would give it a go and I am definitely glad I did. To begin with, the plot line is brilliant showing the stories of several women and how they change emotionally and physically in some cases through the movie. These characters all have their own story arcs, their own personalities and their own ways of dealing with things which creates an interesting interaction when they run into each other. The actresses and actors that play some of the main characters are perfect, playing their roles to their full potential making them lovable and just downright hilarious. The film itself also has some interesting life lessons and things to live by throughout. The film is indeed funny and light hearted and I much recommend it to anyone who wants a good laugh.",2017
1,"This movie had loads of talent to tap into and the writers flopped big time. The director had about zero vision during the whole run time. I'm surprised the producers still have jobs.

There were not much options, and she has already heard about this movie (how to be single), and so she suggested to watch it. if you think it was about love, it is not.

3,"From a social commentary perspective, I can't help but feel like this movie is trying to convince women who are single and hating it... that their feelings are wrong and they should instead be happy! And according to the directors and writers, that means becoming someone like Rebel Wilson's character, Robin.",2016
1,"OK, so the first 5 minutes did it for me; all the clich√©s about men, women and dating you can possibly imagine crammed into the movie right form the start. It is all just so tiresome, the characters are so incredibly stereotypical and uninteresting and everything is just so utterly.. meh. During the first 5 minutes I was utterly annoyed with every single character in the movie. Did not like a single one of them at all.",2016
3,"The movie had potential but fails to deliver. I rate the movie low for two reasons: 1). Movie tried to focus on too many relationships and did a terrible job of developing any of them. The relationships between the various characters is fragmented. The movie would have been better served focusing on fewer relationships and letting us see growth between the characters. 2). Movie is also being pushed to make one think it is a comedy, however in my opinion the majority of the funny parts are shown in the advertisements. I went to the movie looking for a comedy with the characters facing various comedic situations. Had the movie been pushed as one with a more serious view on relationships it us possible that I may gave enjoyed it more. I cannot recommend seeing this movie in the theater. Wait for the DVD or for it to come out on HBO.",2016
4,"How to Be Single (2016): Dir: Christian Ditter / Cast: Dakota Johnson, Leslie Mann, Rebel Wilson, Alison Brie, Nicholas Braun: Disjointed romantic comedy about facing everyday life as a oneself challenge. Dakota Johnson plays Alice, who lands a new job after a separation from her boyfriend. Rebel Wilson plays Robin, Alice's co- worker who is constantly clubbing and partying. Leslie Mann plays Meg, Alice's sister, a nurse who desires to have a baby but is also single. Alice currently stays with her. Alison Brie plays Lucy who is buried in her laptop at a bar where the bartender makes obvious moves on her while trying to maintain a womanizing sense of reputation. Chief problem with this film is that only Johnson's Alice is truly engaged in a story. She attempts to rekindle the relationship that she left only to be met with the news that he is engaged to another woman. The other three actresses are involved in subplots that could easily be stripped away without notice. Mann is appealing as Meg who is pregnant through sperm donor. She becomes the object of desire for a younger man but this could easily be an afterthought. Wilson as Robin is clearly an overly loud comic relief token written more as a convenience for Alice. Brie as Lucy doesn't seem to be involved with the other three girls at all, and her reading session with a group of children was hardly funny. These subplots are disjointed and required a writer more confident than what was issued. Otherwise the film is fetching in its locations with a theme that examines the struggles singles face such as the possibility of watching this film. Score: 4 ¬Ω / 10",2016
3,i was really hoping to see something good coming out of this movie there isn't the plot is really weak the acting is just bad .. Dakota Johnson is a flat actress i didn't laugh there is no comedy didn't see the whole point and rebel Wilson even though i loved her in pitch perfect she keeps repeating herself as fat Amy with the same jokes which are not funny anymore and just surprises me that i can't find Judd Apatow name in the cast because he's the one who used to cast Leslie Mann in his every movie .. for anyone who wanted to see this movie do yourself a favor and go see the trailer it will do .. cause there is nothing more to see,2016
4,"Watching ""How to Be Single,"" yet another comedy released this year hoping that its mediocrity will be forgotten by the time the halfway point of the year comes around, I began to feel a certain pessimistic sadness wash over me. This is presumably a film to showcase the daily events of many single people in heavily metropolitan areas with few cares and big plans every single weekend. Of course, one must reserve some incredulous circumstances that occur in the film as being part of the theatrical spice, but fundamentally, we can hopefully agree that this film looks to profile the kind of debauchery young, single people hope for on their Friday and Saturday nights while they're not confined to one person.",2016
7,"How To Be Single is not a typical romantic comedy,but refreshing, entertaining one for what it's worth. I expected this movie for worse and actually got a lot of fun for sure. Furthermore, multiple laugh out loud-moments. I love the way they used of music and colorful set decoration. Anyway, I repeat it's not a typical romantic comedy but it's romantic and you can have a lot of fun without expecting too much.",2016
5,"A gentle, over sentimental mess that yet cannot be faulted for not trying and not caring. The most irritating thing about a film is when you see the filmmakers having no passion about the project; that happens way to many times with this kind of mid budget film and so, if ""How to Be Single"" can be proof of one thing, is that investing passion in your film always gives some kind of results.",2016
1,"This movie is supposed to make you feel good and absolutely okay with being single while it turns out to be a movie about relationships and their importance. I expected a lot more from the story of each character and all I got was a super-mixed mess of complicated relationships with many people, awkward sex and one night stands. Dakota Johnson's character is so cringe-worthy I can't even. When I think about it, every each one of them is cringe-worthy. Dakota's sister in the movie refers to babies as 'love seeking terrorists'??? yet she desperately wants one, then meets a guy then hides the pregnancy (how can you hide being pregnant from someone you are dating by the way)...AWFUL. Don't waste your time.",2016
1,I want my time and my money back!,2016
6,"How to Be Single should be named How Not to Be Single. Not that it's material is bad, because it's very good indeed. However, it may give off the wrong impression to its younger audience. Dakota Johnson makes some very rash decisions, not knowing who she wants to be with, and where she wants to be. Her newest, closest chum Rebel Wilson hits life hard. Her opinion of a good night is ending up in a strangers house, having many sexual encounters and not remembering much of them. Leslie Mann is the older sister to Johnson, an independent woman with a younger love- interest rattling her cage. And then there's the weird Alison Brie, the egotistic Anders Holm, and the family man Marlon Wayans Jr. These are characters picked out fresh from the stereotype's pool. Gags are thrown in, coming mainly from the outrageous Wilson (no surprises there). Apart from its misleading title, manages to make us chuckle, if not smile. Most women (and men) out there will fall for the adorable baby that Mann has to briefly look after in a very early, very memorable scene. It will be hard to contain yourselves.",2016
5,"Overall rating 5/10. I went into this movie with too much expectations. I thought it would be one of those comedies where you get to see something different that you can really laugh about. This was not like that. It was not about how to be single. the majority of the movie dealt with the typical issues we all have seen before in other romantic comedies ie. relationship issues, going to the club and meeting someone, your party girl in the mix, someone finding happiness and then the main character ""deciding"" to be alone because the relationships she was in did not work out. Throughout the movie you get a few things to chuckle about and then it's done. It was too predictable and seemed a lazy attempt. Marketing and glitters!!",2016
2,"I really tried, I'm a year late I know. I got this movie for free because I connected my Vudu with my Disney account. Even for free, I couldn't get through this movie. I stopped after 30 minutes of the Extended cut. It's painfully unfunny, sexist, and terribly written. The biggest sin of this movie to me is that the actresses here are really talented. I love Kristen Wigg and Kate McKinnon. And I think I laughed at one joke in that first 30 minutes out of all the jokes they were dropping. Nice try Sony but it was dead on arrival. Don't patronize your audience when you want them to like your movie.",2017
1,"OK,we're 75 minutes in, and I didn't laugh once. In my humble opinion a movie that advertises itself as a comedy should as at least make you giggle once every 20 minutes.

It's a shame IMDb doesn't allow a zero as a grade, otherwise I believe it's overall grade would be so much worst.",2017

1,"I wanted this movie to be decent. But it is absolute garbage. I watch his movie from start to finish without laughing at all, and find myself cringing at the acting that was happening. There is nothing at this movie brings that is worth sitting through an hour and 59 minutes. I'm not quite sure what Kate McKinnon's character is supposed to be she walks around like she's got some lame legs and she cannot walk normally and if you watch closely you see her constantly smirking and laughing at her own stupid lines. Don't waste your time",2017
2,"Wow, is this crappy or what? Downright the worst movie I have seen in a while. To add insult to the injury, managed to stumble upon an extended Blu-ray version which is 18 minutes longer than theatrical ‚Äì whopping 134 minutes in all! Yes, this is the all-girls-remake of the 1980's darling ""horror comedy"" franchise, this time starring Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, and, er, the other ones. Most of the original cast return with ""surprise"" cameos too, excluding, of course, the late Harold Ramis. This is just a sad fuckup of a movie where everybody tries and tries for two hours and more, but nothing worthwhile emerges. The only good thing I can think about the movie is that at least they have tried. For a long time, they try to make us laugh with their witty bantering dialogue and good chemistry but none of it materialises and the result is dead on arrival. Alongside ""Anchorman 2"" and ""Zoolander 2"", this must be one of the biggest failures of recent times, where they tried to bring back some cult classic and just fell on their asses. ""Ghostbusters"" is so bereft of laughs or joy that it feels shitty even by movies starring Melissa McCarthy's standards, who's still desperately trying to define and recreate this little magic she managed to create in her breakthrough role in 2011's ""Bridesmaids"". The same goes to Paul Feig, of course, who has mostly directed McCarthy's movies, the first and only creatively successful one being ""Bridesmaids"", of course. He should go back to TV world or something. Rotten Tomatoes' and Metacritic's reviews are far too kind this time, the most telling would be the latter's user score of 2.9 out of 10. The only bits I at least semi-enjoyed in the movie were original ghostbusters' surprise cameo appearances, and maybe Chris Hemworth as the good-looking but stupid assistant to the girls. He's the closest thing this ""entertainment"" had to offer to make me smile. The visual effects look cheap too, although this may be some kind of homage to original movies.",2017
4,"Let me start by saying this,this new Ghostbusters movie is not the worst movie ever released.With that said, this is not a good movie.This movie is one that the studio involved should have never been given the red light to make.Unless this movie Ghostbusters was going to have the original cast brought back for a third film, this franchise was finished a long time ago.The cast of this movie do mix and gel a little, but the story itself is terrible.I did laugh maybe twice watching this movie,but it was silly humor so that doesn't count.There are many cameos in this movie so that can keep people watching a bit .But without a script and story,I'm never watching this again.",2017

No-one from the four actresses is funny, only Kristen Wiig has just a little bit of something.

After watching this, you'll have to find a real movie to watch...",2017
1,"The original obviously has its fans but even if you try to ignore the sexual politics of the marketing campaign, the movie itself seems to detest its core audience, with the script often striking out at people who love the franchise and hatefully labelling people as 'man-babies' and 'basement dwellers'. A franchise that was loved the world over seems to have spawned a 'reboot' that is fuelled by nothing but hatred, and it shows. It's not a comedy. It's an overly-improvised excercise in bitterness. It's like being punched in the boobs by Paul Feig's angry sister.",2017
1,"I am not against remakes because sometimes they can be good like ""The Thing"" or "" A Fist Full of Dollars"" or ""Little Shop of Horrors"" etc But this was a pile of overrated rubbish that was made purely made to further an agenda of feminism and that women are the best and do not require men. ",2017
4,"When I heard that they were remaking the movie Ghostbusters with female cast members, I admit that I was actually looking forward to it, specially considering the four particular actresses they had chosen for the part. I understood that movie remakes are typically the greatest, but considering the fact that 3 out of the four cast members are currently or were once members of SNL, I had some hope. Unfortunately, Wigg's comedic talent wasn't able to shine with her boring character with a lack of personality, McKinnon's character was just upright stupid and unrealistic, Jones's character was just a black stereotype, and McCarthy's role lacked character as well. Many of the jokes just fell flat (Steve Higgins small role and joke with the middle finger, the won tons, Kevin's (aka. Chris Hemsworth's) logo scene, the thing with the hair dye at the end, and so on). Also, the had many references to the original ghost busters throughout the film, and yet I suppose the setting takes place in a universe where the original squad had never existed, it's like a slap to the face to the original cast. Sure they had Bill Murry and few other actors for the older version show up in a few small parts, but they play such tiny roles, and as different characters..",2017

The humor in the original movies were heartfelt and funny, the effects were charming, and I think it even works today, in its way. The effects in this one is more expensive, has more details, but is much more comical, in a bad way. The comedy is about yelling, exaggerated hip hop slang, and fast-paced, waaaay too easy jokes.

1,"Against all reasoning I decided to watch the full movie remake. Where can I begin. First, Leslie Jones (while sometimes funny on SNL) should hang up her acting career and stick to stand-up. She was horrible! I thought I was watching a female Richard Pryor on steroids. Kate McKinnon must have gone to the same acting class as Leslie. The only female deserving of being on the movie at all was Melisa McCarthy because she at least can hold up the others in the cast.",2017

It is a horrible premise to begin with, attracting a lot of negative publicity before the movie was even out. And it delivered.. badly. Mediocre acting, bad script, lukewarm jokes. It does not deserve a further analysis for being so mediocre, a five out of ten movie that gets one star for promoting a pointless gender competition. ",2017
1,"I went into this movie with an open mind hoping that it would not be as bad as the trailers and TV spots suggest. It is. I really wanted this movie to surprise me, to make me laugh to make me care for the characters and have some investment in the story, but it failed to achieve any of that. What I saw was a two hour mess of a movie. An unfunny, poorly written, poorly edited, contrived cash-in on a beloved classic which has some of the poorest dialogue and worst performances I've seen in a while. The computer generated effects were like something out of a live action Disney picture. The music, in particular the theme tune was uninspiring and added no impact or energy to the movie. I honestly can't think of any redeeming qualities that this film has. After waiting so long for a new Ghostbusters film this comes as a major disappointment. Some things are just best left alone.",2016
4,"Watched it tonight after avoiding it for the longest time. I liked the original but I found this version to be just okay. My opinion is that the writing and the jokes were lazy. In the original the characters took the job seriously and they had to work to just capture one ghost. In this one they were slaying ghosts right and left, making a mockery of the storyline. The acting was decent, given the script. But there is no overcoming the poor writing.",2017

9,"Fede Alvarez just gave Green Room a run for its money with Don't Breathe, an incredibly intense film and glorious exercise in suspense. It's one of the best studio-produced thrillers I've seen in years. The premise is simple: A group of teens plans to break into a blind man's house to steal his money. Only thing, the old man is more adept than they realize. While the setup is a little too pedestrian, albeit economical, once the story gets rolling, the film doesn't let up, running at a lean 88 minutes. Other than that, Don't Breathe is best viewed going in knowing as little as possible.",2016
1,"How did this film (and I struggle to call it that) receive so many stars?! THAT is the real mystery here! The story centres around 3 kids who break into houses. Two are dating, and the third-wheel is a quasi-moral-objector who follows along because he thinks he's in love with the girl. The girl clearly strings him along, and her scumbag boyfriend even mentions this to the beta about how he needs to keep himself in the friendzone where his ""b*tch"" put him. Yes, that's how he refers to his girlfriend. There's a really pathetically hamfisted attempt at making us feel some sort of sympathy for this trailer trash princess.. because she has a crummy home life? Because her mom is rude and has a guy-friend staying with them and asks her to go buy a frozen pizza? Are our hearts supposed to bleed? This somehow makes it okay that this girl chooses to be in a relationship with a thug, while consciously stringing along a seemingly nice guy (in comparison) ... and it's okay that she chooses a life of breaking and entering instead of getting a fast food job (I'm from Detroit. Fast food restaurants still exist.) or something of the like? She looks down on her mom, but all we can see is her mom being a typical piece of foul-mouthed trailer trash sitting around on the couch. SHE is the one out there committing crimes.",2016
5,"Don't Breathe is a grisly, unpleasant exploitation film about characters that you don't like going up against a man who is at first somewhat sympathetic and then turns out to be a ridiculous mess of a (human) monster, and it's directed with some skill. I almost wish it had been made with greater sleaze or a total abandon for logic and taste and become a complete Grindhouse exercise, but the problem for me with the film is that director Fede Alvarez - again collaborating with Evil Dead producers Sam Raimi and Robert Tapert - wants to have it both ways, to have characters that, as the audience, you don't really like or have sympathy for so you don't have to worry *too* much once the psycho ex-military Zatoichi man is getting his payback... until he wants you to like them.",2016
2,"It's pretty rare that I get hyped for horror movies, especially modern ones, but I was a little hyped for this. I thought the premise was interesting, and it had potential to be scary. I wouldn't call this a disappointment, because it misses the bare basics of what makes a good horror movie. Next to comedy, horror is probably the hardest genre to get right, the most important aspect a horror movie needs is relatable characters. If the audience can connect with the people on screen, it evokes this fear of them dying, so when they eventually do die, the audience doesn't want it to happen. Think of great horror movies with relatable characters; ""Aliens"", ""The Thing"", ""Halloween"", ""Vacancy"", ""The Descent"", just to name a few. Apparently writing good characters for horror movies is harder than dividing by zero, because these characters might as well be cardboard. There are three victims, one's a jerk, one's selfish, one's apprehensive, that is all. They never change, and we aren't properly introduced to them, so I certainly didn't care when they started dying. Also, one of them gets killed like 4 times, but I'll get to that later. I don't sympathize with these characters, even though I can sort of understand their mindsets, because they're never given a chance to change.",2016

Well I'll give them credit, it was suspenseful. But not because of the acting, or the plot, or the setting. It was suspenseful because you never knew what stupid thing the main characters were going to do next. I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see the next mistake. This movie was a joke. I have never been so disappointed with a movie I was so excited to see. After the girl escaped the house and was pinned in the car by Cujo, you knew the Blind Man was going to get her again. I was amazed at how much trouble these three people had with an old blind man. It doesn't matter that it was in his environment. Who cares. It was an old blind man for gods sake. Once he killed the first guy all bets are off. You attack him. You find something heavy, wait around a corner, set him up by making a little noise and BAM!!! hit him in the head. Get what u came for, and leave. They made this guy seem like Daredevil and Rambo rolled into one, with a little bit of The People Under The Stairs thrown in there. I understand movies are not real life, they are stories. But this movie was about something that could happen. This could be a real life scenario. But there were just too many stupid moments to take it seriously. You knew this was all make believe. You knew it was fake, just a story, just another movie. It was just a movie, and not a very good one. If you want to get frustrated while watching something, then this is the movie for you. If that doesn't sound like your idea of a good time, to me it doesn't, I recommend skipping this flick. You're not missing anything, unlike if you watch it, because then you'll miss about 90 minutes of your life.",2016

I would rather watch a movie of someone peeling an orange with the fire alarm going off for 2 hours then ever watch this movie again. Seriously, don't waste your time. Read a book, watch literally anything else, start a fight club with your neighbors in your back yard.

1,"If you're looking for a thriller where the protagonist sacrifices her ""friends'"" lives in an effort to steal a few bucks from a deranged blind man, then this is the movie for you. She cries out to God for help after two of her friends die (one which is presumed dead) and does not let go of the money she's stole for the ENTIRE movie when the man that loves her does everything in his power to help her get free. Then the writers makes it appear as if she's defeated some sort of evil when she could've freed herself and sought real justice for the woman that was held prisoner. This movie has NO protagonist... No one to root for. I wish all of the characters died or ended up in prison.",2016
5,"I was looking forward to watching this film, but after the first 20 minutes or so, I found myself shouting at the screen because of the ridiculousness of it all. After the break in, and initially being HEARD by the blind guy, they spent half the time stood around like lemons and sneaking around. I must have counted 8 opportunity's for them to grab something and knock the guy",2016
5,"We thought the cinematography, casting and acting were exceptional, and worth seeing. The story, however, has too many flaws. The dog would have awakened the man and put him on guard. How on earth would a blind man track down, capture, and enslave in a block and tackle harness, the woman who killed his daughter in an accident? Without being seen? How could any man survive multiple brutal attacks, including several swinging sledge hammer blows to the head? The police would have identified the blood spatter DNA from both the captive woman and the escaped woman (Jane Levy), seen the block and tackle harness, and not simply closed the case as a blind hero successfully dealing with only two robbers; they would have pursued those leads, even in Mayberry! With a little more work on those issues, this could have been a real classic.",2016

1,"Maybe I'm growing out of horror movies, but this just doesn't do it for me anymore. If you're going to go for realistic, then go for realistic. If you're going for supernatural, go for supernatural. But don't try to mix the two, unless you do it more tastefully like the first two Paranormal Activity shows.",2016
1,"An excessively positive description of the plot would be routine, boring, and improbable. A more balanced description would add that it is stupid, idiotic, moronic, and imbecilic. Over and over the heroes, who really are scum, never get the idea to distract the blind guy by throwing something to the other side of the room. It never occurs to them to smash out a window and escape through it. It never occurs to them to trip the guy. It never occurs to them to pick up things to use as weapons, even though appropriate objects are lying all over the place and indeed are picked up by the blind guy. Near the end, how does the blind guy run way down the street straight for his victim? Is he really Batman, able to echo-locate? Especially after one of the scum/heroes has bashed his head repeatedly with a 2-pound maul. When the police come near the end, wouldn't they have been a mite curious about the basement prison cell the blind guy had constructed?",2016
1,A rating higher than 2 for a film like this one either means that ,2016
3,"Don't Breathe is certainly no Hitchcock or even a Guillermo del Toro film. The plot is implausible and far-fetched. It started out okay, but then anyone who pays attention to details will notice its many flaws and goofs. Several of them have already been listed in the IMDb, but the biggest flaw, I think, is about the dog. When the trio first comes to the house, the dog is chained. They drug the dog and he slumbers in his dog house. Later, all of the sudden the dog is in the house. How did he get rid of the chain and how did he get into the house? No doggy door, bars on the window, etc. Towards the end of the movie, when the girl traps the dog in her car and tries to escape, the blind guy catches her and drags her by the hair back to the house. He leaves his dog behind in the car? Obviously, the dog must have been barking. And when the girl finally does escape, there's no mentioning of the car or the dog. The other plot twist I had a problem with is that the blind guy kidnaps the woman that supposedly killed his daughter in a car accident, impregnates her and thus wanting to replace his dead child. It's ludicrous to think that a blind man could take of an infant. Even if the woman could have carried the child to term, how was she going to give birth with a blind man as a midwife, in a cellar? The only explanation for this part of the movie is that the blind guy was deranged. Oh, and yes, even though he was hit with a sledge hammer, he was hardly injured. I don't understand the big hype about this so-called thriller. To me it's a bunch of crap. If you want to waste your time and money, go see it and judge for yourself. You'd be better of watching a real thriller by Guillermo del Toro or one from the master himself, Alfred Hitchcock.",2016
8,"The central theme lying at the heart of 'Don't Breathe' is the sense of claustrophobia, a sense of being trapped/imprisoned. The director shows us a number of appropriate images like window bars, bars outside gates, prison like shadows being cast by Venetian blinds,etc. to drive home the theme. This theme resonates both in a literal sense with the kids being imprisoned in the house that they had planned to rob in the first place, as well as on a broader symbolic level because it is made clear that these youngsters aspire to break out of the 'prison' of life in a financially ailing Detroit and head for California.

1,I have never bothered to write a review for any movie (good or bad) until now.,2017
8,"Fede Alvarez does it again. The director of the renowned horror film ""Evil Dead,"" brings to you a piece of excellence that will have you hold your breath throughout this morality thriller ‚Äì ""Don't Breathe."" It is an exquisite play that plays with the audience's integrity and the will to do the right thing while conveying the story in such a way that we feel helpless and uneasy the same way that the protagonists on screen do. ",2016
4,Was looking forward to this ever since April/July this year & couldn't wait to see it. The story/concept sounded really interesting & looked as though it was going to be a pretty good film with a unique concept.,2016
4,"I would certainly classify this as more of a thriller than a horror film. Horror films can get away with stretching the imagination more than most films and since this was more of a thriller, in my opinion, there were too many such ""stretches"". Some plot elements were adequately covered early in the film. For instance, Rocky wants the money so she can escape to the west coast...check. The antagonist can drag a person down the middle of the street because it was established via GoPro camera that there is no traffic in that neighborhood...check. He keeps the girl in the cellar to give birth to a new daughter...check. But the bad points outweigh the good...1 - Why is it assumed that the guy has a huge amount of cash in his house just because he got a settlement for his daughter's death? Oh, he's weird so he doesn't have a bank account? The cash in his home should have been based on a better premise. 2 - The guy is in the same room with two of the kids that break into his home and even passes by them in the hall, but can't smell them. However, he walks into the kitchen and discovers they're there by smelling their shoes...ridiculous. 3 - In most of the film the guy is feeling the walls and stumbling around the house as a blind person would normally have to, but he appears out of nowhere fairly quickly to corner the thieves...whatever. 4 - The guy has a person trapped in his basement, yet he has an alarm to trigger the police in case of a break-in...good Lord. 5 - Despite the lack of sterilization and proper obgyn attention, he impregnates this girl with a basting syringe and sperm he keeps in a basement fridge...come on. I could name more, but I'll stop there. Yeah...yeah...yeah, it wouldn't be a thriller without those elements, you say? Nonsense. These are implausible twisting of facts, yet most accept this as good, if not great, filmmaking. Please.",2016
10,"Don't Breathe. Excellent title for movie directed by Fede Alvarez. After watching preview, this movie was on my must see list. Extremely well directed. The blind man, played superbly by Stephen Lang, lives alone with his ferocious looking, big , black dog in a shabby neighborhood house in Michigan. 3 young people, Jane Levy as Rocky, her boyfriend Daniel Zovatto as Money and Dylan Minnette as Alex want to get rich the quick way - by robbing. The blind man , a war veteran, came into lot of money after his daughter's death in a car accident. The 3 potential robbers go to the blind man's house for the money and then come to know about his blindness. Expecting no fight, the three enter his house and from then on, starts the horrible night events. The blind man knows how to live his lonely life despite daughter's accident and knows how to have a happy future. The blind man believes in life for life. Terrific movie. Extremely well directed. Terrific acting by Stephen Lang and Jane Levy. I am not a dog lover and the dog in the movie did a good , ferocious, vicious animal role part very well. excellent cinematography. Good Editing. Overall , a very good scary movie. Do not underestimate a war vet. I enjoyed every scene in the movie. Highly recommended.",2016
1,"OK, so this movie is at the top of my list for the worst movie ever made. A few movies have been on the list over the years, I do not imagine this one leaving the top spot for a long time.",2016
1,"Please do not watch this movie. The directing was decent and the premise was interesting, acting wasn't very bad either, but the plot was the biggest pile of convoluted garbage I have ever seen. They set up no character development for the main bad guy, or any of the characters. A blind guy with a gun? That isn't even remotely scary. At least give us a reason to give a damn about the main characters to get invested in them. The characters decisions also made no sense, even for a horror movie. And even the jump scares were terrible and nonsensically. I would rather eat a syringe full of splooge than watch this movie again.",2016
10,"Personally, this show seems to showcase a more bold Zach, one that isn't defined by his looks, beard or lady sunglasses. Baskets is about a bitter and sad guy, who in his constant pursuit of being a clown, is a huge failure, which strangely enough makes him seem like a huge clown. The first episode had refreshing subtle humor, that when settled makes for an even greater joke. It reminded me of the similar subtle and low-key humor of Greg Turkingtons and Tim Heideckers ""On Cinema"" and I found myself really enjoying every minute of this show, and hoping that the ratings will be high enough for it to spawn several seasons. Some jokes didn't hit as well as others, while others still make me chuckle days after having watched it. Louie Anderson as Mrs. Baskets was great, and was the cherry on a near perfect milkshake. Can't wait for the next episodes.",2016
8,"The pilot was not great. It hadn't really gotten to the deeper emotional stuff yet. But, as the series progresses and we get deeper into the characters, I just fell in love. Some people are complaining that it's not a comedy because it has these more real moments in it, but that's IDENTICAL to Louie. Louie is not a laugh riot. There are good laughs throughout the episode, but the meat of each episode is more about the tragedy of being human. Baskets kind of reminds me of Nebraska. The show is does an excellent portrayal of the mundaneness of people's every day lives and their ordinariness. It's really funny and very moving. I don't see anything wrong with having both things.",2016
10,"With a premise this unlikely (though the choice of Bakersfield was intriguing, and echoed ""Baskets"" nicely), I expected to watch a few minutes then move on, but I watched to the end and was sad it ended. ",2016
10,"I believe this is another one of those shows people either hate or love - and there is no problem with being on one side or the other - I love it! Just as people have different tastes in decorating, food, etc., there's no need to denigrate the quality of a work because it doesn't suit one's taste. I can't stand marshmallows, but I can understand why many people love them. I've always been a fan of black humor and deadpan, and the cast and writing combination seem to be a perfect fit. Being a huge cynic, and getting worse, I appreciate the overall feeling of bleakness presented. Finding the ironic, absurd or cruel humor in everyday situations helps keep me from going over the deep end! It's a comfort to me that every once in a while I find a show that reveals there are others who feel the way I do. Here's hoping it doesn't get canceled any time soon, due to what may be a limited audience.",2016
10,"The writing, casting, acting, timing and ""style"" of this comedy (first two episodes are only available as I write this) are excellent. I'd seen a couple of the promos, but it pushed no buttons. With that said, it was an impressive 'team' involved. Later, being polite, I agreed to 'watch a few minutes' as my wife had said 'I think you'll like this...'. I was near immediately drawn into it and didn't leave the chair until I'd watched both. I've now watched both episodes twice (adding FX NOW just to watch).",2016
4,I love Louis C.K. and Zack Galifianakis but this show is just not funny or sad or entertaining at all. It really is a big downer. It is full of pathetic people in pathetic situations with no clue and it all adds up to a big nothing. I found myself not caring about anyone in the show at all. I didn't even smile ounce during the whole first season. I don't think any of the positive reviews on here about this show are real. If you are looking for a show that will make you wanna kill yourself here it is! Where is the humour? Nothing redeemable about this show. A complete waste of time.,2017
10,"The writing, acting, production and direction of this black comedy are fantastic. I realise for anyone looking for an uplifting experience it won't be your cup of tea, but for those with a particular sense of humour it'll be thoroughly addictive. ",2016
10,"Excellent comedy. Sensitive, smart and surprising episodes. Adicting. My husband and I watch few ephisodes every night and we wish it will not end. The development of the charactures is wonderful. Martha Kelly is an amazing comedian and thanks to the show I found her funny and lovely ephisodes in Utube. Louie Anderson plays Christine Baskets, mother of Dale and Chip and he is doing extra ordinary job as a loving, caring, supporting and desapointed mother. I love the idea of the two set of twins. It's great. Zach Galifianakis has everything. Charm, talent, sensitivity, humur and great sense of timing. I wish this show will run for as many seasons as possible.",2016
9,"I can't help it. I've come to love this show. The characters have grown on me. At first I was a bit taken aback at the style of the show. After about the first four episodes I was hooked. I can't wait to see what happens next to my dear Baskets family. The show is original, there is no laugh track, and it's more true to life than most television these days. Chip is a nice guy, an aspiring natural clown, and Bakersfield is a real town. What's not to love. I'll be rooting for Chip and hoping that the show is successful so that it will continue. Kudos to FX for airing this wonderful, refreshingly unique take on the American family. I think that the Baskets are more true to life than most people would care to admit. I for one have been in dire need of characters that are life like in a show. I hate to over analyze. All I know is that I love it. I hope there will be more.",2016
5,"Few shows get more things right and wrong all at once. On the one hand, the side characters are wonderful. Louie Anderson as the mother is brilliant, but all the others are terrific too -- Martha Kelly as Martha, Sabina Scuba as the horrible French wife, Chris McLaughlin as the cowboy clown, etc. This is the heart of the show, these character- driven bits that shine.

1,"First off, I am a huge Zach G fan. Well, I was that is. Now I just want to punch him in the face.",2016
8,"I didn't like this show at first and Zach G can be insufferable at times, but the characterizations are quite strong, chiefly among them Louie Anderson as the mother. Every scene he does is so brilliantly portrayed, you can see layers and layers of depth to Christine. Is it funny? Well, no it isn't, but his performance walks such a fuzzy line between comedy and drama (much like Louis C.K.'s show) that I'm tempted to label it as an emblematic cipher of humanity; her anger, hopes, memories, limitations, strengths, and relationships to other people are all played out in her every mannerism and facial expression. Who ever thought Louie Anderson was this talented? That was a well deserved Emmy. I've watched every episode so far and I'm already looking forward to next season.",2017
6,"This actually is not much of a review. More like a rumble. I like the show, the writers are smart, the dialogues are well written, the performances are OK and all that jazz, especially Louie Anderson! Wow, that man touches my heart in every scene!!! ",2016
9,"When the series started, and I saw that Zach Galifianakis was starring, I set my DVR to record the series. Yes, I started watching for Zack Galifianakis- I now watch it, primarily, for Louis Anderson. During last season I told my husband, If Louis Anderson doesn't win an Emmy I will be physically ill. Louis won the Emmy, I didn't have to get ill. So glad that Zach & Louis CK saw his potential outside of stand-up. The rest of the cast, it goes without saying, is so special, Scripts are so well written. Truly a gem, I feel very lucky to have found it.",2017
1,"How can such things as this even be financed. It's not funny, nor sad, nor original, just awful. An incredibly heatable character, surrounded by sad pathetic characters. The characters in the show can barely believe how stupid this is. ",2016
1,"No idea how anyone finds this even remotely funny but each to their own. Given the talent combined to produce this, one would assume it would at least have one redeeming feature, but I can't find one.",2017
9,"It took me a few episodes to warm up to Baskets. It has the awkward, quirky genius of Zach Galifianakis, and also an underlying sweet sadness that viewers of Louie may relate to. There are occasional moments of ""umm what?"" that you may expect from a former writer on Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! The viewer is torn over the character of Baskets, because he is pathetic, but still, ornery and unlovable. Galifianakis does a great job walking a line between the two. The character of Martha (Martha Kelly), seemingly Basket's only friend, is the Valium to his manic wanderings. She endlessly absorbs the abuse he gives her like a mother being told ""I hate you"" by her 5-year old. The beautiful Penelope, (Sabina Sciubba) who openly married Baskets as a way to stay in America, is cruel, but in such a coolly, detached, unemotional way that you don't even dislike her for it. Louie Anderson as Christine Baskets is hysterical. I laugh more over ""her"" than anything else. He does the parental judgy thing so well. I get that the show isn't a runaway hit, but the absurdity of the characters does grow on me. Stick with it and you may find yourself enjoying it more and more.",2016
2,I love Louis CK and his unorthodox comedy writing for his show as well. And Galifianakis can pull a lot off from deadpan comedy to tweaks. But this show is one massive fail.,2016
1,Maybe it's just me but this just seemed to be a mess to me. I can't imagine anyone enjoying this. The gags are not funny and all been done before. I see what they are trying to do but it just misses the mark of being funny and ends up just being sad and painful to watch. One of those things where the guy just never catches a break and he's such a douche you don't want him to or really even care one way or the other. It just did not generate any interest in me to see what would happen next or where the story was going. I barely made it thru it. ,2016
10,"The French Clown - sadly tragic, hopeless romantic, ironic and funny, confident and unsure. This is what creators: Louis C.K., Zach Galifianakis, Jonathan Krisel have brought to us in the TV series 'Baskets'. And not just in one character! Each character is a French Clown but only Chip - the rodeo clown - is shown as the clown.",2016
4,"This takes me way back. Back to the days leading up to the Brand New Batman TV Show. My friends & I were actually counting the days to air. This was a similar experience, except I was counting down to Baskets all alone. With Batman it took us all of 5 minutes into the much anticipated premiere to decide that we would not be Batman watchers. None of us were comic book aficionado's & maybe if we were, we might have enjoyed it more or at all. The preceding month or so our televisions had been inundated with really kool ads for the New Batman TV Show, especially the Batmobile! What a drag. Well here nearly 50 years later, loving Zach Galifianakis, I had high hopes, obviously too high of hope, if I can trust my ""review or not to review"", NOT. It was More than hopes, expectations. I did watch Baskets, the first two episodes this time but without much hope of it having started & staying shark jumped after the first 10 minutes. I guess this just showed me once again my comedic heroes the latest Zach Galifianakis can't make just any ole thing funny or if he can he quit trying too early on this one. the previews once again looked great. A promising premise. dun duntidun Done",2016
10,"I can't wait for this show every week. It is so absurd and goofy! Louie deserves an Emmy for Mama Baskets. She says the most ridiculous things in the sweetest way, like- how we'd be living on Mars if Ron and Nancy Reagan were still in charge, and it would be so nice there. Galifianakis Is a riot in dual roles as twin brothers Chip and Dale (ha). Martha Kelly delivers the same deadpan humor as Galifianakis with perfect timing as the enduring insurance adjuster/friend/chauffeur/mistaken wife whose tolerance for Chip's dismissive treatment is answered with good sound advice like always have a mini talking koosh in your purse. Rich and original I belly laugh every week. Hope it gets picked up for another season, I think this is an Arrested Development in hiding, don't let this one slip by!",2016
6,"This started out looking like it was going to be perfect: a collaboration from Louis CK (Horace and Pete, Louie, Pootie Tang etc), Jonathon Krisel (Portlandia, Kroll Show) and Zach Galifanakis, but my feelings are a bit mixed at the end of Season 1. I was hoping that this ""clown"" theme was going to be about the ""comedian"" and there would be some interesting comment in that regard, but I'm not so sure that was the plan as the show doesn't really delve into the clown in Baskets as much as it does the jerk in Baskets.",2017
10,"Agnus Dei that is, Lambs of God. What an extraordinary film.Martin Scorsese confirms his seriousness of intent and his enormous respect for his audience.He rates us so highly that he confides in us, telling us something that clearly comes straight out of his heart. Dry, severe, an intellectual's sensibility that becomes clear and accessible to all as we realize that Scorsese is not trying to sell us something but just to tell us, to share with us something that obsesses him. I was enthralled and moved throughout. The performances in a Scorsese film are always superb but in Silence, Andrews Garfield goes a step beyond superb. He managed to make his priest someone I knew personally even if his reality is far, far away from us in time and space. A masterpiece.",2017

A film made for the love of film not for box office expectations. A work of love from beginning to end. Then, Andrew Garfield. What a year for this young spectacular actor. The kindness in his eyes made the journey so personal for me. I must say that I've been very lucky because I've been lead by my mentor (another Martin by the way)into the world of Scorsese. I found Scorsese's films brilliant yes, but too dark, too violent and hopeless and my mentor said, ""No, don't stay in the periphery, go in.

9,"Christianity came to Western Japan in 1542 by way of Jesuit missionaries from Portugal who brought gunpowder and religion. They were welcomed mostly for the weapons they brought and their religion was allowed to be practiced openly. Christianity was banned, however, after reports circulated of missionary intolerance towards the Shinto and Buddhist religions, and there were rumors of the sale of Japanese into overseas slavery. It wasn't until the late 1630s, however, that a complete ban on Christianity was declared and enforced by the Tokugawa Shogunate and persecutions, torture, and murders were relentlessly pursued.",2017
8,"There's a reasonable argument to say that SILENCE is one of Martin Scorsese's better movies. The talk is that it was a passion project of his for decades, finally being released in all it's artistic endeavors and mysteries. I suppose someone else could argue the opposite: that this is a story full of brutality and despair without the signature style of the aged director. I think I'm falling right on the middle on this one. This is surely one of the year's most powerful stories, and yet I have to admit it left me cold.",2017
5,"SILENCE is beautifully filmed and strangely involving for such a grim and slow-moving tale. For a 2 hr 40 min movie, I never felt bored or felt that the story was unnecessarily stretched out. As an ex Catholic who, as a child, was intrigued by the idea of martyrdom and by tales of the saints who were killed because they refused to renounce their faith (and so, got an express ticket to heaven - a very attractive end result for one who feared hell as much as I did), I could identify in a more distanced way with the protagonists and their Catholic followers in Japan.

10,"Wow, I would be lying if I said that I wasn't silenced after watching this film. Really interesting subject matter. I am curious about the book now. When I first heard about the film I thought it looked like a modern ""Andrei Rublev"" set in Japan. Well, I was wrong about that. This film is very much its own beast. These are my first impressions right after seeing it.",2017
3,"20 years in the making (apparently) and yet the most stark silence was that of the audience after the movie who clearly and with understandable deference to the Scorsese canon, were unwilling to immediately call this movie out for the self-indulgent disaster it actually is and could find few words to compensate for the searing boredom most had undoubtedly endured. Perhaps it's art masquerading as entertainment but, for me, it fails as either. The story was sparse, the characters undeveloped, the cinematography sometimes lush and promising and often the best thing about the movie. The message? There was little here that gave me anything to chew on. Faith is a tough gig at any time but particularly on a clandestine crusade in 17th century Japan? Sure. When life is almost unbearably awful the promise of paradise in the afterlife is alluring? Uh-huh. Belief is riddled with ambiguity, uncertainty, fear and doubt. Yep, I get it. If we were meant to sympathise or even empathise with a mission to convert the peasant classes in isolated and xenophobic Japan then I failed, badly. When God spoke in the silence I got confused, more worryingly so did the Jesuit priest. What was the question Scorsese was struggling so obviously to answer? I don't know but as Bukowski once said ""for those who believe in God most of the big questions are answered"" and for those who don't? Well they have an opportunity to be their own God.",2017
5,"I left half-way through. I didn't storm out, but after 1.25 hours I'd had enough. What I saw was well-done, but I kept asking myself ""What was the point of all this?"" The film was hugely supportive of missionising, but was the Jesuit missionising in 17C Japan a good thing? The Japanese government had a policy of keeping out all foreigners, including missionaries, but they had good reasons for doing this. As had been seen in the Americas, and was being seen in China, missionaries came hand-in-hand with commercial interests, backed up by the military. It usually didn't end well for the local people, who were usually colonised and often enslaved.",2017

1,I was attracted to this film because of the director's prestige and because it was an adaptation of a well-received book. It has also received many positive reviews. ,2017
1,"Every so often the Christian movie makers try and take this subject on and every effort is a failure. Quite simply put, the Japanese wanted their own culture more than they wanted the Western one, and most importantly, they were willing to fight for it tooth and claw. I know I'm suppose to feel great sympathy for the poor priests struggling against the heathens, but I don't and I don't want to. I'm quite happy that Japan has a great culture of its own design and evolution and so all the movie slander promoted by even a great director like Martin Scorsese seems just wasted talent. Oh, there is plenty of ""talent"" in the film; director, camera, actors, but the script and the of course the ""idea"" can never succeed. I know that ""christian hardship porn"" is satisfying for many believers, but unless you are one, you should let this movie go away.",2017
5,"I was expecting an Epic on the level of ""Shogun"" and got a lecture on the rejection of Christianity in feudal Japan which was shallow and unexplained . The subject matter of Japan in the 1600's as Japan is introduced to Western Culture and Christianity is ripe for an in depth and detailed portrait of the clash between Bushido and Western thought, and is well documented- elsewhere. I was expecting a more detailed study of the resistance to Christianity by Japanese culture of the time to preserve the order of Bushido. Nowhere in the film are the traditional concepts of Bushido and Budhism represented in the film, except for implicitly.",2017

1,"You endure a lot of torturous scenes hoping for a good, at least logical conclusion... but no, the one who is supposed to be the hero quits. Padre Rodrigues not only completely undermines the sacrifices made by his and God's followers, but he commits heresy and leads many, many souls astray by caving in and writing against his own Faith. Liam Neeson's performance is pitiful. I suppose that's a testament to how this usually good actor battled with his own conscience and could not act his way out of it. Andrew Garfield is a big let-down in the second part of the movie. Again, all that build up for not only being a quitter, but a traitor in the worst way you can be. THIS MOVIE IS A FRUSTRATING WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY, at the theater or at home.",2017

10,"Saw an advance screening: This is a powerful film, incredibly challenging and well-acted. Amazing location footage, historical details from 17th century Japan, and depiction of a clash of cultures between East and West. Scorsese is clearly doing a Kurosawa homage here, as the film has an old-fashioned epic feeling to it. As for the plot based on Shusako Endo's historical novel, it's remarkably even-handed. At the time of the isolationist Tokugawa shogunate, which only ended in 1867 after American gunboats forced Japan's ports to reopen to trade, the Japanese clearly saw the Catholic faith as symbolic of Western cultural and political takeover. But does that justify the torture, coercion, and killing of Christians to make them abandon their faith? We might consider a historical analogy: When the Spanish later felt the same way, driving the Moors out of Spain and forcing those who remained to convert to Catholicism because of the perception that Islam symbolized cultural and political takeover, do we excuse the Spanish Inquisition? The best answer might be that we can understand even if we do not excuse violent push-backs against invading cultures. There is perhaps an allegory here, as well, to the current plight of Syrian refugees and their reception or non-reception by European nations. In any event, the themes here are rich and complex, and the cast -- particularly Garfield, Neeson, Driver, and the masterful Japanese actor who plays the inquisitor -- are outstanding. This is Scorsese at his finest, eschewing black-and-white thinking in favor of complex moral dilemmas. I don't think I've ever seen a mainstream Hollywood film that is as intelligent about addressing cross-cultural and inter-religious dialogue as ""Silence."" The anguish of religious faith is part of what's going on here, but it's only the centerpiece of a very rich cinematic canvas.",2016

5,"Just to clarify one thing: I don't hate Tim Burton at all. In fact, I kinda love his work. He has a very unique and imaginative vision, seems to have a tasteful choice for actors (besides Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter), and can really pour his heart and soul in some of his films like ""Edward Scissorhands"", ""Corpse Bride"", and ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"". But, just like any director, he has his missteps also. Some of his recent work is very lackluster and, at times, flat-out bad (Planet of the... BLAHK!).",2016

My son, also immensely enjoyed the books and read them as quickly; and my daughter had heard us continuously talking about how good the books were. The movie had so much potential, but sadly left both myself and my children disappointed. Eva Green is mesmerizing as always, but why oh why re-write an excellent story into a hotch-potch of ideas that don't work as well as the original? Was such a drastic re-write necessary? It's not as if modern film making methods couldn't have coped with the magic of the book. The beauty of the original story was lost, rushed and slightly non-sensical in parts. Save your money - read the book instead.",2017
1,"It's official. For a number of years now it's been suspected that Tim Burton had lost his love for story telling and this film just confirms it. There exists no story whatsoever in this film, which is an achievement considering it is based on a best selling novel with a coherent story. For me this film was made just so Burton could live out his fantasy of recreating Ray Harryhousen's famous stop motion skeletons. Which he does badly, and to an odd ambient trance soundtrack so out of place it made the Mad Hatter disco dance in his awful Alice film look like art. The acting is awful considering the talent at his disposal, the exposition is so clunky and the dialogue so stilted I feel sorry for the actors. You can really tell Burton just didn't give a rats ass about giving any direction to them. Which would have made sense had the visuals been fantastic, but no, they were clich√©d, old and tired. Tim, please, retire with whatever dignity you have left. I felt like I needed a shower after this film.",2016
3,"My daughter and I had read the books. Fans will be disappointed because the film deviates from the original story so much, it is surprising this is called an adaptation.

Miss Peregrine is also not portrayed as she was in the book. I could go on and on. ",2016

However, this movie was so unoriginal from the book it felt uncomfortable watching it. I felt angry, disgusted and humiliated. Mrs peregrine- although Ava green acted so well that is NOT what Mrs peregrine behaved like in the book, think of her similar to professor McGonagall. And Emma, where to begin? Again the Ella purnell acted well but seriously? Emma and the rest of the peculiars did not come to collect Jake because Mrs peregrine asked her to??? Emma ran away from Jake, was very hostile and dragged him to the peculiar kingdom for questioning. She then broke down when she heard the news of her grandfather. None of that happened. And her power of air? Emma wasn't as half short tempered as she was in the book. There are so many things wrong with this movie it's hard to cover it all. I was very offended at how the hollow gasts were portrayed and how comic Samuel L Jackson played Barron. He was the wrong guy for the role. I was not scared of the hollows in the film. They looked like weird out of shape monsters..and the ending? No comment.",2016

Things didn't end okay in the first book and it's ridiculous that they altered the story. it's basically like they took the original story, and changed every thing to make it their own.",2016
5,"First off, I would like to say, the movie looked very interesting. It was pretty to watch and well done but that was about it. I also want to specially point out how horrible acting actor Asa Butterfield did playing Jake. I mean, when he needed to show emotion it was like a youtube video actor without any previous emotional actor training. The story started off good with some sciency stuff explaining it til the Jake came across the home for Peculiar children. I get the fact that it is still a fantasyish and I know how Tim Burtons movies are most of the time but the plot holes here was soo big and so frustrating they were not ignorable. I mean the movie starts off, like I said, trying to explain the powers of the kids which gets you interested but towards the middle they just completely give up on explaining them and everything is more fantasy then Harry Potter. I wouldn't mind fantasy if you didn't sell it as a interesting sci-fi superpower movie. However, the children has some amazing powers and their enemies are obviously inferior to their powers but still, infuriatingly for example, a kid that is strong as an elephant wont fight because she is a kid, Miss Peregrine wont go back in time (her power) to get everything better. Towards the end there a couple battles and for a lack of a better word are utterly childish with stupid solutions and IDIOTIC conclusions. This movie had amazing potential but screwed up with its plot holes and inconsistensy in its storyline.",2016
8,"The story is about Jake who stumbles upon an orphanage where there are beings with extraordinary gifts. He meets Miss Peregrine, who invites him to be a part of the family. Burton delivers a breathtaking movie, with gorgeous visuals. As he brings a fairy tale to the silver screen. At the end, I found myself unable to stand, As ""Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children"" tuggs on all the right strings and plays a nearly perfect symphony. What stands out in this particular orchestra is the soundtrack, As it breaths life into the story. ",2016
10,"Tim Burton does it again - he manages to create with passion and imagination a whole new world, for those of us who need new worlds. Thus if you love fantasy and dreams made serious and scary go see it in 3d because it's great. If you are more of an adult than the child within and you like films with linear plot and logic and exhaustive explanations you probably won't become a fan and that's OK too. Just don't rate it low just because it's not your type, a movie should be rated for what it was meant to be and for what the team behind it tried to accomplish. Watch the trailer, if you like it you'll probably love the film. It's worth mentioning that it is quite dark and scary so it's not for every child.",2016
1,"Lots of people will say i'm full of BS but i can honestly say, Tim Burton picked up the book said....i don't like any of this and completely rewrote it. Instead of making Emma the flamethrower she is, he makes Olive? a timid little girl who hides behind an apparently teenage Enoch (when in the book hes a preteen hardly). She is a strong female lead who kicks ass and intimidates Jacob when she catches him. That's right, she hunts HIM down and holds a knife to his throat; bringing him in under the pretenses that he is a Hollow and is trying to kill them. He has to present the letter he found in his grandfathers belongings to prove he is who he is. He completely rewrites the beginning, middle and end. Though some of the elements were the same, he decided to make this movie suitable for children..which it should not have been. Hate me if you must but I'm calling it as i see it. I walked out...literally seething in the Colorado snow falling winter unaffected. He changed the ages, took out good characters, did no character developments of the fact Emma and Abe were serious lover's and Emma was INCONSOLABLE when she finds out Abe is dead. I seriously cannot believe people liked this movie. And the fact Burton had to use a sell out like Jackson to play Barron is disgraceful. The fact he butchered this movie so horribly makes me in shock people actually liked it. Did anybody actually read the book? I've compared the antics of this book to the genius of J.K Rowling. Ransom Riggs really sold out for a little dough. This books twists and turns were so amazing i couldn't put it down. I finished it on a 16-hour flight to Japan and couldn't wait to pick up the second installment. It's sad that we can't even have a good adaptation to a genius book. He changes almost EVERYTHING, no character development, nothing about the fact Jacob absolutely hates his life and finds going to Wales as a way to get away from his terrible neglectful parents. What was with the fact he cared about his job? Or that instead of Ricky taking him to his grandfathers, his boss does? What they couldn't find another teenage boy to play the part? HIS BOSS HATES HIM AND THE ONLY REASON HE WORKS THERE IS BECAUSE HIS PARENTS OWN THE BUSINESS!!! They even used a different nickname for what his grandfather calls Jacob. There were literally PHOTOS in the book giving an illustration of what the characters looked like. Why did Emma wear a blue dress instead of a white one? I don't understand. He didn't stick to the book at all...expectation was not the same as reality. Instead we got a sell-out for actors and CGI effects, and in-turn received a Disney- like, happy-ending, package of crap.",2016

The first hour of the film is so dull, and when the film finally starts to move, the story has been totally rewritten.",2016

Sure the Tim Burton Easter egg's, cinematography, and some interesting scenes were great, but with the dull story, terrible CGI, boring Characters, and mostly mediocre performances made the film a bit underwhelming. It was a very disappointing movie and I hope Tim comes back to become a master director again. But for right now we still have to deal with the mediocre movies. Did not see Big Eye's yet so I can't judge that movie, but for what I saw, it was just a mediocre movie.",2017

The story was very familiar to me going in. It was one of the most beloved films of my childhood, and the original Disney film still looks amazing today. I don't know why, but nothing about this version interested me. Some of the differences are easy to pick out--there is no comparison between the original Baloo and the Bill Murray performance for me, as I much prefer the original. Most of the rest of the movie, I just didn't care about. King Louie, Shere Khan, even Mowgli--they just feel empty and uninspired.

10,"The Jungle Book is a live-action/CGI fantasy film that retells the story of Mowgli, an orphaned human boy who, guided by his animal guardians, sets out on a journey of self-discovery while evading the threatening Shere Khan. Neel Sethi plays the main character, Mowgli in the movie. He is the only human being on screen and as his first ever role, this kid actor is truly magnificent. He is as good as any kid actor has ever been, even favorably compared to Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense. The computer generated imagery is brilliant all throughout, definitely some of the best ever and the 3D is just mind blowing. In every single scene I kept getting surprised and thrilled at just how amazing the CGI and 3D were. I think the main reason as to why this movie worked it's because it also has a very good story line that's mixed in with the amazing visuals. Also, the voice actors are all perfectly cast. Especially Idris Elba as Shere Khan, who is truly haunting in every scene he's in. That was one well made and scary villain that Mowgli had to face. Jon Favreau did a fantastic work with this movie, cause really this story has been told many times before, and yet this movie feels fresh and interesting nonetheless. I'm glad that it's doing so well in Box Office because it completely deserves it. Movies like this must be appreciated so that they can inspire more great work, and maybe one day, even erase movies like Transformers.",2016
10,"Mowgli (Neel Sethi) is a man-cub raised by the Indian wolf Raksha (Lupita Nyong'o) and her pack led by Akela (Giancarlo Esposito) ever since he was brought to them as a baby by the black panther Bagheera (Ben Kingsley). Bagheera trains Mowgli to learn the ways of the wolves but Mowgli faces certain challenges and lags behind his wolf siblings, and Bagheera berates him for using human tricks like tool building, instead of learning the ways of the pack. One day, during the dry season, all the animals in the jungle gather at the Peace Rock to drink the water that remains as part of the Water Truce, a timeout called during a drought that enables all animals to gather at a water hole without fear of being eaten by larger, more predatory animals. The peaceful gathering is disrupted when the fearsome Bengal tiger Shere Khan (Idris Elba) makes his presence felt. He detects Mowgli's scent amongst the crowd and threatens his life since man is not welcome in the jungle. He holds the scars on his face as proof of man's cruel and destructive nature and issues a warning that when the Water Truce ends and the Peace Rock disappears, he will come for the boy. Thus, a debate and argument arises amongst the members of the wolf pack as to whether or not they should keep Mowgli. But before a general consensus is reached, Mowgli voluntarily decides to leave the jungle for the sake and safety of his pack. Bagheera volunteers to guide him to the human civilization. However, en-route, Shere Khan ambushes them, injuring Bagheera while Mowgli manages to escape with the help of a herd of water buffaloes. Mowgli, now alone, stumbles upon a thick canopy where he meets Kaa (Scarlett Johansson), an enormous Indian python who lures him in with promises of safety and an assurance that she knows who and what Mowgli truly is. Kaa's hypnosis shows Mowgli a vision of his father being killed by Shere Khan and of himself as an abandoned infant being found by Bagheera and also warns of the destructive power of man's ""red flower"". Having successfully wrapped Mowgli in her coils, Kaa attempts to devour Mowgli, but he is rescued by a sloth bear named Baloo (Bill Murray). In exchange for saving Mowgli's life, Baloo tells Mowgli to fetch him honey which is atop a cliff, to which Mowgli unwillingly agrees. Together, they form a close bond and Mowgli decides to stay with Baloo until the winter season arrives. Back in the jungle, Shere Khan visits the wolf pack looking for the ""man- cub."" When Akela states that Mowgli has left the pack, Shere Khan kills Akela by throwing him off the cliff. He demands that the boy be handed over to him. Confident that Mowgli will return again, Shere Khan takes over the pack. When Bagheera returns to fetch Mowgli, he discovers that Mowgli has decided to live with Baloo. Although tension is raised between the three, they all agree to sleep on it until the following morning. At night, Mowgli hears a cry for help and discovers that a baby Indian elephant is trapped in a deep pit. Using his tricks, he fashions a rope to rescue the baby elephant. This forms a bond between Mowgli and the Indian elephants. Following Bagheera's instructions, Baloo unwillingly confronts Mowgli and lies to him that he never considered him a friend, hoping that Mowgli can change his mind about staying with him. But Mowgli is suddenly abducted by a group of monkeys who take him to an ancient ruined temple and present him to King Louie (Christopher Walken), a Bornean orangutan-resembling Gigantopithecus who tries to coerce Mowgli into giving up the secret to the elusive and deadly ""red flower"". Baloo and Bagheera arrive just in time to distract the monkeys and manage to hold them off while Mowgli flees into hiding. King Louie chases Mowgli through the temple, causing it to crumble on top of him. Before Mowgli leaves, King Louie informs him of Akela's demise. Furious of the fact that Baloo and Bagheera kept him in the dark about Akela's death, Mowgli decides to return to the jungle and confront Shere Khan to avenge the death of his leader and end his tyranny. But first, Mowgli ventures into the village where the humans live and for the first time, he sees his own kind from afar and gazes at them in amazement. He steals one of the burning torches and heads back to the jungle but accidentally starts a fire. Baloo and Bagheera follow him in close pursuit. When the news breaks out that a man with the ""red flower"" is making his way into the jungle, all the animals gather at the Peace Rock. Mowgli confronts Shere Khan, but sees how all the animals of the jungle cower in fear at the sight of the fire he holds. He throws away his torch into the water, allowing Shere Khan to attack him. Bagheera, Baloo and the wolf pack manage to hold him off, thus buying Mowgli enough time to set a trap in the burning jungle. He lures Shere Khan into a dying tree with a fig branch and is able to coax him into stepping on it, causing it to break. Shere Khan falls to his death into the pit of fire below. The Indian elephants later help to extinguish the fire by diverting the river. Raksha then becomes the new Alpha and leads the wolf pack. Mowgli decides to do things his own way, having at last found a true home in the jungle with the animals, including his friends Baloo and Bagheera.",2016

Going into the film, the most impressive aspect that i was looking forward to the most was seeing, or hearing the fantastic cast in action. Having Bill Murray, Ben Kingsly, Idris Elba, Scarlet Johannson, and Christopher Walken cast as the characters we love is enough to get me looking forward to the film. Some fit more than others but overall, the talent paid off. Even though it is a 'live action' adaptation, only like 5% of the film at the most is real, the rest is all done through some of the most impressive CGI i have ever seen. That is a testament to young Neil Sethi's ability to act, as it was essentially him in a green room talking and interacting with nothing. ",2016
9,"To those who still hold any degree of skepticism for Jon Favreau's The Jungle Book‚ÄîDisney's live-action adaptation of the Rudyard Kiplingclassic‚ÄîI say just sing along to ""Forget about your worries and your strife¬Ö"" That's a guaranteed earworm from this really good film. Complete with splendid sound design and flabbergasting CGI wizardry, director Favreau, with cinematographer Bill Pope, deftly crafts this spectacle not only to dazzle viewers but also to enhance its dramatic agenda.",2016
10,"If there is one thing that Hollywood is good at is ruining our favorite childhood films, but not with this film. So The jungle book focuses on a boy named Mowgli that is raised by a pack of wolves in the jungle. But when a tiger named Shere khan learns of his presence, he must flee the jungle in search for the man village. Helping him get there is a panther named Bagheera and a bear named Baloo that must protect him until they reach they reach their final destination. First the pros. The special effects are amazing! I've never seen cgi animals look so realistic on screen before. Neel Sethi does a good job at playing Mowgli. Considering that this kid had to work with nothing, then he is does an excellent job. The characters are very likable. Whether they are good guys or villains. The story seems kinda simple, but when it is directed in a way that makes it entertaining, then your going to find yourself liking this film. To be completely honest i didn't see any cons to this movie. Overall i really enjoyed the jungle book. It was fun, visually dazzling, action packed, and funny at times. One things for sure when it is on DVD, I am going to buy it.",2016
2,"If you are an aficionado of Rudyard Kipling, don't go anywhere near this infuriating mish-mash of sentiment and CGI bignoting. It is little more than a vehicle for Bill Murray, who lazily reprises his Garfield characterization - oddly, since he is on record as saying that the greedy cat was the biggest mistake of his career. Sorry, Mr. Murray - turning a smartassed fat feline into a smartassed blimp of a bear doesn't redeem you in any way.",2016
9,"CGI. A source used to hide props or things in sets, not a good source for characters. My mind is off that statement know changed thanks to the work of Jon Favreau and cast/team. This movie FYI has fantastic CGI, never in this movie I thought that those creatures were CGI. The voice/real acting from all cast was fantastic, even from kid actor, Neel Sethi. And also from the fearsome character, Shere Khan. Voiced by Idris Elba. The story and directing runs smoothly with the visuals and comedic acts animals and human do. This movie is an amazing one from the visual acting and the acting, it deserves a lot of money from the box office, see this movie in theaters or rent it if you can, almost perfect.",2016

10,The Jungle Book is still achieving record highs in International movie box office. Disney is truly the best children movie company in the whole world.,2016
10,"Directed by Jon Favreau (Iron Man), based on Rudyard Kipling's timeless stories and inspired by Disney's classic animated film, The Jungle Book is an all-new live-action epic adventure about Mowgli (newcomer Neel Sethi), a man-cub who's been raised by a family of wolves. But Mowgli finds he is no longer welcome in the jungle when fearsome tiger Shere Khan (voice of Idris Elba), who bears the scars of Man, promises to eliminate what he sees as a threat. Urged to abandon the only home he's ever known, Mowgli embarks on a captivating journey of self-discovery, guided by panther-turned-stern mentor Bagheera (voice of Ben Kingsley), and the free-spirited bear Baloo (voice of Bill Murray). Along the way, Mowgli encounters jungle creatures who don't exactly have his best interests at heart, including Kaa (voice of Scarlett Johansson), a python whose seductive voice and gaze hypnotizes the man-cub, and the smooth-talking King Louie (voice of Christopher Walken), who tries to coerce Mowgli into giving up the secret to the elusive and deadly red flower: fire.",2016

And in case that picture isn't sharp enough for you, along comes Jungle Book to crystallize the issue.",2016

3,"This film was like walking down the street and someone walks up to you and starts having a conversation but, they start the conversation in the middle and you don't know what the hell they are talking about because they never stop to explain what they are saying.",2016
1,As many others I played the Assassins Creed games and was looking forward to this film however it is safe to say that I was extremely disappointed. No matter if you have played the games or not this film was awful. First things first the script is poor. If I hadn't played the games I would have struggled to understand many of the references. The script is vague and confusing in parts which led to a man who sat in front of me leaving half way through (I wish I did the same). Although I am a fan of Michael Fassbender the quality of the writing meant he was wasted in this film. When it comes to the special effects the use of CGI was average. The fighting sequences weren't as good as I expected as it wasn't clear what was happening. The overall story was disappointing and the fact that there will be a sequel made it even more disappointing. I hate to compare but the games were good and the film was rubbish. I would not advise wasting time watching this. Please. For your sake.,2017
5,"Assassins creed is a pretty straightforward franchise. Its about historical conflicts, and cool dudes that run around taking out major targets whilst doing awesome parkour. I'm not a huge fan of the games (I've only ever played IV) but as someone who is into history, I was pretty stoked for this movie. On top of that, Assassins Creed is also a reunion For Justin Kurzel, Michael Fassbender, and Marion Cotillard; who all worked on the most recent version of Macbeth, which I absolutely loved. My expectations for this movie were high. So high, in fact, that I disregarded the overwhelming onslaught of hate that came in the wake of the movie's early screenings. Boy, was I wrong. ",2016
4,"I don't even know where to start but if I would have to choose a single word to describe this movie, ""mess"" would do just fine. Shortly, for lovers of mindless kung-fu action, this movie is watchable but gives viewer very little satisfaction. Don't let the good cast and well known game franchise fool you. This is not a good movie. Sitting for the whole two hours was a painful experience and at around 1:30 mark, I prayed that the movie would just finish.",2016
9,"I watched this movie with apprehension because of the bad reviews by critics. But I did enjoy the movie and I don't even play video games. And the reasons why I liked this movie is because: 1. Action scenes and chase scenes are very good and fast paced. 2. Acting by the cast was superb - Fassbender, Cotillard and co. 3. Visual effects are good.",2016
1,"OK, I love AC games and the whole AC universe. The first game was a bit boring but thanks to Ezio's trilogy I learnt this wonderful world and have been experiencing till today, in AC comics.",2017
9,"There is a reason I don't pay attention to reviewers before seeing a movie; seems most of them have lost the ability to view a movie without preconceived notions. Too much over-analyzing. Very little of what is put out these days is in any way realistic. I'm not looking for realistic when I go see a movie; I'm looking for an escape from the daily grind. I'm not a gamer and decided to see the movie since I'm familiar with Michael Fassbender and I like his work. I chose to see the 3D version, which I rarely do, and am glad I did. It was a thoroughly enjoyable movie! Kudos to Damien Walters for the stunt work--great to watch.",2016
7,"Assassins Creed is by no means perfect, but I did enjoy it. The film has the classic setting from Assassins Creed games, a modern day protagonist enters the Animus to relive the memories of his ancestor. The film does a pretty good job explaining the series mythos to those unfamiliar with the games. Sadly, we don't spend as much time with the ancestor Aquilar as we do with the present day Cal, and Aquilar feels under developed as a character. The movie also felt a bit short. It really could have benefited from a longer run time, to give more character development to the ancestors, and explain some of the characters motivations better. The action in this movie is great, the story is solid, and the characters (that are properly developed) are interesting. Both Fassbender and Irons play their roles well. Overall a decent movie any Assassins Creed fan would enjoy. The critics like to bash it because it's a video game movie, and it's cool to hate video game movies, but it's not bad at all. 8/10",2016
2,"Assassins Creed is a movie based on the computer game of the same name, although it is a unique story set in that universe. It focuses on the search for the Apple of Eden, the key to mankind's free will and the source of a struggle between the assassins and the Templars. ",2017
10,"I'm going to come out and say it, the critics are right, but there is a big but here. If you have played this game, you are going to truly enjoy it. The big problem that I think is not going to brake the video game curse is the fact that it isn't possible to cover the whole story in such a short amount of time and appeal to critics and people who haven't played the game and never will while satisfying gamers in a way that won't scare them away from the video game itself. So if I'm talking right now to a gamer, I would say that this movie has it all, but if I'm not, you will probably dislike the movie or simply just enjoy it as a C grade movie that got you entertained for two hours and you'll forget about it in a few more.

1,So the new year has kicked off and many were hyped to see the video game turned movie.,2017
1,Assassin's Creed,2017
7,"Following a somewhat parallel story to the original game, I do wish they would've stuck with original characters. Despite that, the film remains a fun and intriguing watch. The change of the Animus from a bed-like system to the VR style arm was something I originally disliked, but that change ends up playing well into the film visually and aids in parts of the story. The action scenes are well choreographed and exciting, countered with what may be a few too many close up facial expressions and dialogue that might easily confuse someone less familiar with the base plot of the franchise. As far as movie adaptations of video games, this is a far better rendition than many other attempts. As a standalone film it needs some work. But I know they intended to produce a trilogy so I'd like to believe the opportunity to release sequels will give the audience more of what they're looking for, while this movie may have been a bit too much set up rather than development. Personally I generously offer it 7/10, and would recommend seeing it. I hope it is successful enough for them to finish the intended trilogy.",2016
4,"I haven't Play the video game, I only saw the movie, but honestly, I think It was a very poor movie. The story was inconsistent, it had very boring scenes, the acting wasn't good enough and the plot... It just doesn't work out. Nothing is explained. And what to say about the characters? They didn't developed any characters, so the viewer can't empathize with any of them... At the end of the movie, it leaves you a sour taste in your mouth... because it looks like there's going to be another movie. In conclusion, don't waste your money. This is my personal opinion, from a person that saw the film without having play the game.",2017
8,"Besides a few yearly sports titles, I don't find myself enamored with any single video game series. That is, besides the Assassin's Creed games. The film definitely captured the game's tone, even if it sometimes makes frustrating plot choices.",2016
4,"This movie isn't as good as it is supposed to be. First of all, if you didn't play The video game you won't understand the story. or you will get only a few head lines , but the story is much more deeper than this. in my opinion, if the creators didn't make a new part with full details. and there is another important thing, there is no actor in Hollywood can do this character, I just that you get a professional parkour player. - 2- where is the team work in the movie, where are the counter attack moves, where is the sword work? 3- this movie is a huge disgrace to the assassin's story. there must be new parts that must be stronger.",2017
10,"So we all know the trend of video game movies being terrible. Well, I'm happy to say Assassin's Creed BROKE that trend! Really quick one thing to point out is that people complained that the movie was giving a PG-13 rating. This is probably one of the most brutal PG-13 movies I've seen in terms of violence. It was like they were going for an R rating then at the last minute the studio was like, ""You know what. Just cut out the blood."" Which honestly if that's how it went I wouldn't be surprised. The choreography is fantastic and some blood is even shown. Michael Fassbender as Aguilar was a great casting choice. His character was well written and I felt a sadness for him (You'll know when you watch the movie) All in all a great performance! Now is the movie perfect... No. Of course not. Every movie has it's flaws. Some may say the CGI is over used (Which I thought it wasn't) some may hate the physics (But it worked for the movie) Again, little nit picks people are going to say just because they can't have fun watching a movie! Let me leave you with this. I had a blast watching this film and I highly recommend it to even people who haven't played the game. 10/10 fantastic movie to end 2016 on!",2016
10,"This is, by far, the best video game adaptation I have ever seen. I do not understand why the critics have been putting down this movie with such violence... Is it because they want to make the filmmakers pay for the fact that they chose high-caliber talent instead of goofy actors and an 'obvious' choice of director? Is it because the producers decided to go with a indie film director whose vision they believed in? I think the music is amazing (bravo to Justin Kurzel's brother) and the visuals are extraordinary. All the actors did a fantastic job in this movie. This is unlike any video game movie I have ever seen, and will go down in my book as the best adaptation out there today.",2017
9,"Despite critic reviews and reports expressing their concern on yet another video game spin-off attempt, I decided to still go view the movie on its first showing. I can honestly say that not seeing this movie in theater would be a mistake. The action sequences combined with excellent cinematography and special effects allowed for a thrilling ride from both the present-day Cal Lynch to the Inquisition-Animus Aguilar segments present in the film. Being that I have previously played many of the Assassin's Creed video games, the plot proved easy to follow, flowing from one concept to the next easily. ",2016
10,"This movie is more of an homage to the game. The writing is similar, the plot is similar, and all the action are great and well done. The movie did a great job at recalling all the great moments in the AC series, and retrofitting them into this new plot. If you have played all the games, then this movie is perfect, it doesn't go into detail about the creed or the templars, you will have to fill in the blanks on your own. Some scenes are very powerful if you understand the back story and things that happened in the game and connect the reference. Basically this movie is a huge ester egg from the games. A bunch of references,and all in all it was fun watching it with a friend and pointing out which scenes were inspired by which game in the series. For example the ending is like a big ass homage to the original game trailer, the thing that started it all. Also if you are a veteran of the games, you wouldn't want to sit through the whole Templar vs assassin's and their creed explained for the fifth time anyways, this movie cut to the meat of the games, and I was glad that they did like this, not a lot of video games adaptation are bold enough to skip very key plot points. This movie is catered heavily on the true AC fans, I am for once am extremely happy I bought a movie ticket full price to go and support this production. It did not let me down and I am extremely proud of the cast and crew for their work on this movie.",2016

10,"Just watched the movie and I have to say I'm shocked that it's rated so low on IMDb, as I have watched much, MUCH worse movies with better ratings. Scrolling to evidentially biased ratings and reviews I'm giving it a 10, just hoping it will balance out the harm done. Jessica Chastain delivered great performance, but she wasn't the only one, whole crew was really good, but she really did earn that globe nomination. Furthermore, movie is beautifully captured, cinematography is great and whole atmosphere is really nice. The last but not the least, it's a great thriller, with an unpredictable twist and not boring for a moment. I do understand it's might be different experience watching it for an European audience, as from the start second amendment and gun legislative is for most of us here absurd, however, although I can understand that for some Americans it might seem one sided story, my question is aren't many of story lines one sided, to be honest it's not advertised as documentary, so why should you even expect other side to be equally represented? Strongly recommend to give this movie attention it deserves.",2017
10,"It makes absolutely no sense that this film is bombing at the box office, this is a great film! Maybe it's because it's fresh off the heels of an exhausting election, or maybe it's because of the other big time films out right like Star Wars. I sincerely hope that it's not because of the NRA, I hope that people won't avoid this wonderful movie just because of the gun lobby. Jessica chastain gives a real powerhouse performance as Elizabeth Sloane, a tough as nails lobbyist for the Brady campaign. Also here is Sam Waterson, who works for the gun lobby, and I really liked him in this role, he fit in it well and gives a good performance. I loved the great writing in the movie and the clever moves that are made. This political drama is so interesting and well constructed. Mark Strong is so good here too, chastain and him have a great on screen chemistry/presence too. The film will keep your attention the entire way through, it has too because there is just so much happening. Now I know that plenty of conservatives and big time Pro-NRA people will want you to avoid it and maybe even write a bunch of scathing articles slamming it, but don't listen, oh what a great movie this is! 10/10!",2016

10,"i can tell that the gun lobby is also active on IMDb. this movie is straight told with unexpected moves. it is realistic as well as true. but in a world of alternative facts difficult to accept. it goes on too long far too long.. it has to stop here and today. the connection with the gun lobby and the senate is authentic. the characters are real. what i liked most of all was the fact that everyone is selling out anyone except the call-boy. in this world of business and in the world of politics , the decent one is the one who sells his body. while everybody would kill for their ego or for wealth.. he remains sincere and surreal . the whore is the only person with ethics and value is messed up world is quite a message, although it had little to do with the main story... again i feel disgusted by the reviews who have nothing to do with the movie but a lot with their political views... the reviews prove this movie is true!",2017

But In my opinion, this is Jessica Chastain's all time best role. She deserved at least an ""actress in a leading role"" nomination. She achieves a better performance level than Natalie Portman - ""jackie"", Isabelle Huppert - Elle"" or even the winner - Emma Stone in ""La La Land"". Again, my opinion, of course. The interest prediction on this movie describes an ideal curve, growing strongly from the start till the end. And at the end it explodes in a rainbow of emotions you could never predict.

I had hoped for something much better but i was sorely disappointed, this could have been really good but you are forced to think the same way as the main character and that does not make the viewing pleasant.

The film explores the ways men are treated differently from women.

I actually saw the movie and I will keep politics aside but as you can tell from other reviews a lot of people are just down voting or up voting this movie based on politics. My score and critique are primarily focused on the screenwriter and director. These two factors I feel sunk the movie. This is the Jonathan Perera's first screenplay and while a valiant attempt he wrote something in one of the hardest genres, about a culture that isn't his, dealing with an issue he doesn't understand. And the director who I loved in The Best Marigold Hotel has many of the same issues, not understanding the American landscape. It is like Mel Gibson doing Braveheart, it isn't accurate at all however the difference is that Braveheart wasn't being shown to William Wallace. ",2016

The United States-Australia production is directed by Alex Proyas and stars Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, Brenton Thwaites, Chadwick Boseman, Elodie Yung, Courtney Eaton, Rufus Sewell, with Gerard Butler and Geoffrey Rush.

10,"I just saw Gods of Egypt with my 5th and 7th grade boys on 3D Imax, and  we loved it! An original movie for a change, not a sequel, or prequel,  or reboot, or franchise, or comic book adaptation, or spin-off film.  This movie had very striking visuals, sweeping music, fun acting and  action sequences, and engaging characters. It moved along very briskly,  despite its slightly long run time. We had no difficulty following the  plot (which is certainly no less plausible or linear than Episode VII!)  or understanding who the somewhat unfamiliar Egyptian mythological  characters were as some reviews suggested we might. There was a nice  character arc for Horus, and even a thoughtful message from the gods to  humankind at the end. Ethnically inaccurate casting choices--yeah, it  would have been nice to see a more authentic cast, but these actors got  the job done, and that is no reason to skip the movie if you like this  sort of film, in my opinion. Give this film a chance, you may enjoy it  much more than you expect!",2016

7,"Alex Proyas' ""Gods of Egypt"" is a film that is boldly and unabashedly silly and preposterous. Few other words can describe it. It has the pratfalls that beset typical Hollywood fare. It is already the subject of controversy due to its preeminently Caucasian cast. It has both critics and audiences sharpening their knives, a film supposedly destined for failure.",2016
10,"Despite the snobbish critics reviews I thoroughly enjoyed my relaxing afternoon in the theater watching Gods of Egypt. I remember when the critics were all panning Raiders of the Lost Arc, and look how many viewers enjoyed the escapism of that movie. The story moved along at a good pace and the 2 hrs passed quickly. Yes, it is a typical movie of its genre, but what is so wrong with that. Not all movies made are Oscar worthy, but they are still filling the category of ""Made for enjoyment"". I watched the movie in IMAX 3D. If your looking for an afternoon to escape our current political climate go enjoy Gods of Egypt.",2016

Gerard Butler has always said how much he loves telling stories, and this is absolutely a story. It's a whole other world. It's the definition of imagination. Yes, it may be silly to some. Sure, it may not be as accurate as some people would like it to be. But it's fun and thought-provoking and intense and beautiful and dream-like and diverse. Really, though, it's the type of movie where you really do need to see it for yourself. Go ahead and see it. Let yourself be immersed in this fantasy world for a couple hours. Be entertained.

There is real chemistry between the actors. I identified with many of the story's characters. That made me feel good. You don't need to know anything about the Egyptian Gods to understand what is going on. The story is well balanced, it has a solid beginning, middle and end. The Gods of Egypt keeps your interest from beginning to end. There's a lot of variety. So much is going on and that's one of the reasons I love adventure movies. The cinematography and the CGI are fantastic. You really enter another world without hesitation. This Is Pagan Friendly Film About the Egyptian Gods! There's no camp here. The Egyptian Gods are respected and feel quite real. This is a story about love, hormones, real courage and dare I SAY SELF-SACRIFICE! Yes! There is a really positive spiritual message in the Gods of Egypt.Wow!",2016
8,"It's a mythological movie, always liked mythological movies, and this one was no exception. I went into the movie not having read any of the critics reviews, and when I came home afterwards, I was surprised to see so many critics have bashed the movie. The only problem that they can cite is that this movie had too many white actors in it! This was never a problem in the past, The Clash of the Titans and the Immortals were similar mythological movies from just a few years ago, also with a mainly white cast and it was never even mentioned for them. Since this movie came out so soon after the 2016 Oscar awards ceremony, which was criticized heavily for not having any black actors or black-based films nominated, maybe this movie got unfairly caught up in the fad of the times? ",2016
10,"I love this movie, it is very good, spectacular and artistic.I liked the actors... Horus was very SEXY :)))) and Seth was very strong! Like them. I know the Egyptian mythology, because of it I think this is film is an absolutely entertaining film. The story is ""built"" very much from the mythology. I ask the director, and the actors and the team, PLEASE do not believe the negative reviews!! This movie is very good! Your work is professional. I would like more films in this topic :))) I see that the filmmakers thing that there are only Greek(Roman) or Nordern mythology... This is not true! There are more and more very interesting stories in the Egyptian mythology and in the ancient Egyptian history. I am looking forward the next movie, the next ""episode"" Gods of Egypt!!!!!!!",2016
10,"So there were apparently a ton of critics looking for a home-run in terms of plot and character development. That's a lot to expect from a 2 hour action movie seeking to tell an entire story. Though I sound like I'm saying it's bad in these aspects, I thought they did a great job of explaining the characters and creating a clearly understandable story. It's not as there is a narrator walking you through the events. If you pay attention to the actual depiction of the story rather than something ridiculous such as an actor's accent in a story where gods roam the Earth, all the events will be clear to you. Somehow, critics have the magical power to ignore what an author portrays by trying to nit-pick all the clich√©s and tiny inconsistencies. If you become immersed within this movie and accept what might be normally odd in the modern world, the story will transcend being simply a cgi thriller. The cgi is in fact extraordinarily well-done, but the purpose is to make this impossible world come to life. The characters portrayed their roles excellently. There were only 2 parts which were rather silly, but after each of these events was a scene that was rather reconciling. The fight scenes also don't look like mindless exchanges of punches, stabs, and pointless movement, but was rather well choreographed and you could trace each action. Both the beginning and ending were great, and I left feeling thoroughly satisfied. Even my mother who normally despises action movies felt that it was terrific.",2016
9,"It is difficult to understand why people write negative reviews when it comes to entertainment (movies, music etc) and EVERYTHING is subjective; as if their opinion is the most objective- it is impossible to have objective opinion when you are a person reviewing things created by other persons - ALL IS SUBJECTIVE AS PEOPLE ARE DIFFERENT. Stop reading any reviews. See the trailer and go see the movie so you can judge it for yourself. For me this one was very entertaining because I treat it exactly for what it is supposed to be - a fiction fun movie destined to ENTERTAIN ; I should be CRAZY to start an analysis of every minute of it trying to influence others for some stupid reason just to show how many things I know about an imaginary history",2016
8,"So, this is a big budget action and special effects movie about Egyptian gods battling each other to rule the world, right? When you go to a movie like this, you have certain expectations--its not likely to be on the Best Picture short list next Oscar season, and everyone involved with making this movie knew this. But from the very first breathtaking camera shot, you can tell The Gods of Egypt was crafted with enthusiasm and a spirit of fun and unrelenting inhibition. For what this movie was striving for, it is absolutely on target. I saw it on IMax 3-D with my 5th and 7th grade sons, and we loved every minute! Visually dazzling, a soaring musical score, satisfying play-to-the-back-row acting, interesting and somewhat unfamiliar mythological characters, amazing costumes and set pieces--I think this film delivered on all fronts. In a way, Gods of Egypt is more original than many similar films of this genre in that it is not a prequel or sequel or reboot of a franchise, or a comic book adaptation. For instance, while it shares its episodic and implausible plot and style, it is a far more original film than the beloved Episode VII (but without decades of nostalgia and anticipation to paper over its weaknesses). It introduces and creates characters completely new to us in a fascinating and beautiful imaginary world. You will not forget the striking image of the stern but grandfatherly sun god Ra (Geoffrey Rush plays it large here!) circling the disk of the world with his space craft/chariot, sun in tow, as he daily battles a hideous chaos monster in defense of all humanity! The judgment of souls in the underworld is another well-presented scene. Horus has a nice character arc. It ends with a worthwhile message from the gods to humanity. More importantly, it literally offers a thrill or two every 5 minutes for its entire duration. And unexpectedly, this film has no mummies whatsoever! I feel the culturally inaccurate casting issue, while perhaps regrettable, brought an undeserved sense of negativity about this film. In any event, these actors appeared to be 100% invested in making this film work, and they got the job done, in my opinion. We recommend that you set this concern aside and enjoy the many pleasures The Gods of Egypt offers--a no-expenses-spared B movie that presents striking and immersive visuals, appealing characters, and a clear understanding of its limitations and aspirations. I seriously don't understand the horrible reviews, and suppose that people who hated this film probably brought a preconceived negative expectation in with their popcorn. Give it a chance, there is much to enjoy in The Gods of Egypt!",2016
6,"The Coen Brothers are heroes of mine. They travel from universe to universe remaining true to themselves. Hail, Caesar should have been , I thought, a familiar universe for them but they seem lost. A journey without a clear destination. There are, of course, a few pleasures along the road. The scene between Alden Ehrenreich and Ralph Finnes is a gem. Alden Ehrenreich is a breath of fresh air with vintage breezes that are exciting, compelling and totally disarming. The tap dance routine with Channing Tatum is also a lot of fun even if I can't quite get Channing Tatum. Great body and he can dance but he seems to be somewhere else. Impossible to connect on the screen with him. I hear he gets millions of dollars per movie so maybe it's just me. The opposite of George Clooney who launches himself body and soul to every moment he has on the screen. I will shut up now and wait for the next Coen Brothers movie.",2016

Trailer made it look like an fun Frank Capra kind of film. And when we walked out of it, given all the above, we missed something. A movie. There is none here. It is a great job made by talented people aplenty. It wants to be that fun film but never finds the movie. A few jokes. Not enough. Quirky fun characters, but not weird enough. Sublots aplenty, but they never run together and never are resolved. Good acting that goes nowhere.

""Hail, Caesar!"" is a disappointment of epic proportions; an empty, unfocused satire on Hollywood business that has too many characters fighting for too little screen time, almost no energy despite attempting to work with a high-stakes plot, no strong character relationships despite the fact that everyone is trying to get a word in at all times during the course of the film, and finally, no central conflict that results in the characters ostensibly mustering up any kind of energy.

3,"From the previews of this film, I had a high level of anticipation for the Coen Brothers' latest venture, expecting it to be an hilarious and satiric romp through the halls of 50's Hollywood. The Coens are excellent technicians so the riffs on MGM, 50's Hollywood Stars, and the general machinations of the studio system were very well done. But I'm afraid the film's achievements were pretty much relegated to this dimension and overall the film remained in the category which I term ""All Style and No Substance,"" clever but ultimately delivering a thin story. Along the way there are some wonderful bits, especially Channing Tatum singing and tap dancing in a suggestively gay sailor dance routine, Tilda Swinton playing twin columnists, Alden Ehrenreich doing some hilarious cowboy stunts on a horse and with a lasso, and Ralph Fiennes directing in a sort of prissy manner. However, none of the plot lines ever yielded anything substantive. I found it difficult to figure out just what the Coen Brothers were attempting with this film.",2016

It does have its moments, though: My favorite was Brolin trying to get reassurance from an array of religious leaders that his new biblical epic won't offend anyone. And Ehrenreich, who I'd never heard of, was great as the clueless but sincere rodeo expert who has somehow fallen into serious act-ting... much to Ralph Fiennes' chagrin.

SIX ! the worst film of 2016 so far. I felt that it is the Coen bros weakest film. There is one good thing. Channing Tatum's musical number, is very catchy and well performed but other than that its just a mixture of unfunny moments being held together with a piece of rotten string.",2016
9,"Maybe not one of the Coens' masterpieces, but easily in their second tier, which means it's great. It depicts a day in the life of a Hollywood studios in the 1950s, with Josh Brolin as the studio head whose job it is to keep things running smoothly. The main plot revolves around the kidnapping of the star of the studio's gigantic Biblical epic, Hail, Caesar!, Baird Whitlock (George Clooney). Several other movie stars play parts on the sidelines, including Scarlett Johansson as an Esther Williams-type swimming musical star, Channing Tatum as another musical star, and Alden Ehrenreich as a Western star who has been transferred to a more sophisticated drama. Ehrenreich, despite being the least familiar actor among the cast, steals the show. There are tons of familiar faces in the film (Ralph Fiennes, Jonah Hill, Wayne Knight, Fisher Stevens, David Krumholtz, Frances MacDormand, Tilda Swinton - playing twins!) and many of them don't get more than a minute of screen time (Hill, for example - you've seen his entire performance in the trailer, and he made it onto the poster), but everyone's highly amusing. The plot might not amount to much, but it's all a lot of fun, and, as you would expect, wonderfully shot and directed.",2016

It is the most artless film ever made and everyone who went to see it deserves a refund. The actors-- Clooney, Fiennes, Johanssan were terrible to watch but how did Josh Brolin get into this chaos of a somewhat expensive chaotic senseless film. The screenwriters and director should send this junk to any festival that offers an award to the WORST FILM FESTIVAL of 2016 and there wont be any competition!

1,"Occasionally the Coen Brothers turn out films with a little substance, but these days it's mostly powder-puff satirical comedies. 'Hail Caesar' belongs firmly in the latter category, with its farcical tale of a lead actor kidnapped by a clique of Communist intellectuals from the set of a campy melodrama about Ancient Roman legionnaires. The studio's Mr Fix-It searches for his lost star while he negotiates with a potential new employer and pacifies the inflated egos of actors, directors and gossip columnists.

In this single small moment, Yates and Skarsgard put on display Tarzan's utter commitment to the woman he loves while at the same time same evoking the internal contradiction of a man who in adulthood could pass among society as a aristocratic Englishman, but whose feral upbringing has left him with a volatile beast within that can overwhelm the civilized trappings in an instant. Unlike the filmmakers who have come before him, Yates effectively captures this duality ‚Äì and in so doing delivers a film that is fresh and appealing to modern sensibilities, yet is faithful to the character of the books in ways that Hollywood has never attempted before. The result is pure pulp poetry with a beating heart. Edgar Rice Burroughs would approve of it, and 21st century audiences will, if they can be lured into theaters to see it, be intrigued and satisfied by it.",2016

I was also surprised by the pseudo environmentalist doctrine they weave into the plot. The babe is being taken away by the bad guys to her death and the only thing she can say is, ""Promise me you wont hurt the animals."" Really? The best line in the movie is when the black guy says, ""Can we just stop this?"" My sentiments exactly. The overly sensitive, crying, cannibal warlord was a bit too much.",2016

So, we have every single non-white person heroic; every single white person psychopathic (except Tarzan, of course. Even Hollywood can't write the narrative which puts Samuel L Jackson into the actual Tarzan role. Yet). I resent having to pay for this ludicrous propaganda. I studied African history for my degree. Where do you think the slave trade originated? Who stopped it? Yeah, go do some research and answer those questions for yourself. I think at the end of this movie (I don't care if there are spoilers ahead; this film is THAT bad) Tarzan and Jane have opted to stay in a squalid African hut to have their baby because, ya know, who'd want a huge manor house in England with servants and hygiene?

However, I found a good chunk (about 85% IMO) relied on realistic scenery, makeup and special effects. I mean... they're not going to use real gorillas or lions with the actors, but the CGI ones looked really good and will have you mesmerized by the detail.

1,"Who are these people who think this was a good movie. This is just a fashion show, plus showing nothing but a ridiculous plot and terrible clothing choices. The sensitive lollipop kids got this movie so politically correct, it is a horrible and painful movie to watch. As for Tarzan, he even looks laughable in those pants swinging from vines. For over 100 years Tarzan wore a loin cloth. Not this time, the lollipop kids saw to that. A horrible movie on so many levels.What the heck are these positive reviews for.Terrible terrible plot as well.Tarzan is the king of the jungle. Who really cares if he is the hope and ruler of the people in the jungle. I don't. Those animals don't look real. They looked unreal.",2016
10,"FLASHBACK: 1998¬Ö Having tracked the project from pre-production to final release, and with all the excitement and anticipation I'd built up for the film, I entered a dark theater in Little Rock, AR completely jacked UP to see ""Tarzan And The Lost City"". It was the Saturday noon matin√©e, first weekend of the release. Having read the original novels as a youth, I was looking so forward to the movie that would do justice for a modern audience regarding the character I grew up loving, dispelling all the silly pop-cultural stereotypes and giving him a proper and fitting introduction. I got the best seat in the house that day, but for the wrong reason as I looked around and realized I was the only one in the room. Optimistically, I later joked with friends that I'd gotten a ""private screening"" of the film. A few years later, I ended up launching my Tarzan fansite, TARZAN.CC, utilizing many graphics pilfered from the ""Tarzan and the Lost City"" website to emulate the look. It was my tribute to the film. And I soon began that journey of excitement and anticipation yet again for the new rumored Warner Bros. Tarzan project. I'd love to chronicle that adventure here, but it would distract from this review so I'll sum it up by recognizing the names of the fallen on that journey: Director John August, Director Guillermo del Toro and Screenwriter John Collee, Director Stephen Sommers¬Ö I finally lost hope that the film would ever come to fruition.",2016
5,"This is one quite empty, uninteresting film. Honestly, I found old Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan film far more better than this. I even found Bo Derek naked breast and bottom version better and to mention that I enjoy low budget TV series ""Tarzan Epic Adventures"" with Joe Lara in title role¬Ö So, what happened here? Directing and writing is just average, nothing that spectacular, intriguing, or investing in the film. It has some, decent story and development in it, but characters are just dull, one dimensional and empty. Tarzan resides in London with Jane, trying to act like nobleman John Clayton in civilized society. And that goes pretty hard for both of them. A man named Rom (Waltz) staged a trap for Tarzan to return to Africa so that Rom could bring Tarzan to a tribe to trade him for diamonds. So, Tarzan must find the way to save himself, Jane and others. The decent story, but it still has that diamond clich√© crap. ",2016

9,"I haven't seen many Spanish movies so far, but I can honestly say that Contratiempo/Invisible Guest is about to be brilliant. I am not familiarized with the actors from the cast, but I can say that their acting is a very good performance and all the filming crew made a good job with this one ! Filming angles, soundtrack, story line, cast, plot, etc, all of them are a lot above the average thriller/mystery clich√©s that Hollywood got us used to, but still it has some minor issues that, in my opinion, of course, I would have changed. Those 'little problems' made me to decide this movie is a 9, not a 10, a 10 would be a perfect masterpiece, however, this one approaches perfection somehow. 1 hour and 46 minutes are surprisingly enough for this film, even if it may seem too little for a 9-rated movie, for the entire time I didn't get bored or badly surprised, it was just very thrilling and full of action and mystery. Contratiempo is, in my opinion, a must watch for thriller/mystery enthusiasts and legal movie fans.",2017
9,"Being an avid Thriller watcher, I came across this Gem by accident....and what an adventure this movie takes you on. Who Done It, comes to mind and just when you have solved it, it then twists you into another scenario. It is in Spanish and there are Subtitles, but it doesn't take away from this masterpiece. Well done, Oriol Paulo for his direction, and well done on the film editing. I will be watching out for more of Paulo's films. Well and truly worth the watch.",2017
10,"Saw this recently on a DVD. The movie is an excellent suspense thriller. It was full of twists and surprises. The movie has unexpected turns n hidden clues. It is masterfully directed n exquisitely written by Oriol Paulo. Superbly acted by everyone that appears in it. It also contains beautiful cinematography, great pacing n skilled editing. The plot- a powerful businessman stands accused of murdering his lover. He was found with her dead body in a locked hotel room. The twist ending will leave you with ur hand on ur head. The director's debut film, The Body has been on my radar for a long time. Fans of Jagged edge, Primal fear, Usual suspects will definitely enjoy this.",2017
10,"I'm widely known for enjoying French cinema, however I believe this is the first Spanish film I have ever seen. I'm glad to confirm that it will not be my last, because this movie was incredible. It was the type of film that I like more than any other type. A mystery thriller that is guaranteed to have a twist. It's also a type of movie that Americans don't do overly well. They always seem to think that a movie needs endless car chases and shoot-outs and that the story should just be there to facilitate those. The Europeans seem to understand that the true brilliance in cinema comes from the writing side of things. The intricate webs they weave never cease to astound me.",2017
10,"Still speechless, I've come here to write this review. This movie is one of the best movies I've ever seen. PERIOD. I loved it and am sure YOU will too. I caught myself being suspicious of the final outcome but it was nothing near as close as it turned out to be. Watch it. It's thrilling, emotional, suspenseful, mind-blowing, an edge-of-your-seat movie. These Spanish movies really are something. They manage to put you on an emotional roller coaster and show you something you never thought a movie could do. WOW!",2017
8,"I'm not very familiar with all the Spanish actors and actresses but I'm sure the ones in this movie must be the better ones from Spain. Because the acting is really good in Contratiempo or The Invisible Guest. The story is everything you want when you want to watch a mystery crime thriller. It's never boring, with plenty of twists and turns. All you want to do is know how this story will end. It keeps your attention from the first second till the last one. I saw plenty of Spanish movies and some are really good, way above average. This one is definitely one of the good ones. If you look for a good entertaining mystery movie search no further and watch The Invisible Guest. You won't regret it.",2017
10,"Wow, just wow. I'm and avid fan of thriller movies, but this one give me goosebumps. Jose Coronado always steal the show since I see him for the first time in another great Spanish thriller, ""El Cuerpo"". For one moment, you think you have all the pieces of the puzzles but the director of this masterpiece persistently change the answers and the questions. By the way, the director and writer of ""Contratiempo"" is the same one of ""El Cuerpo"". That's not a coincidence, Mr. Oriol Paulo can write. If you're a fan of thriller movies and you're having a hard time trying to find a good movie, this is the one. I say it's better that the 85% of the Hollywood thrillers these days. Another Spanish film that beat a lot of Hollywood movies without the promo and a gigantic budget. What a masterpiece!",2017

Adri√°n is a famous businessman and also happily married , but then his spouse to be aware his detention and treason . Shortly after , his ordinary lawyer (Francesco Orell√°) informs him there is a witness to the killing has appeared and then things go awry . ",2017
10,"This is a movie where when paying attention to every scene the viewer is rewarded with meaningful and purposeful action and dialog not suspecting that all the while something is afoot but what? That's why you stay tuned and glued to the screen not wanting to miss out on what is being acted out or presented. This is the first time I have come across this type of thriller. You see not only does this movie entertain but it also challenges you to take a side and share a point of view that when done is doubted because of the next scene and what takes place. Just when you think you have a reasonable explanation for what is and has taken place, a new fact enters in making you say ""what is going on"" in a good way. At that point, you are wholly committed and don't know that you have been captured and the movie now has you in its grasp. This is quality entertainment. Kudos to the story teller, the director and actors for pulling off a nice memorable movie that you will want to not only discuss but recommend as well. I always watch Netlfix with subtitles because I have learned so much goes on in movies that one may miss and the sub titles make little comments like wind blowing or so & so is speaking or car door slamming enabling the viewer to become intimate with the flick. My wife and I read every line and even rewound a couple of scenes to see if we were ""getting this"". All and all a good, decent ride. Highly recommend sunflower seeds or popcorn so you don't chew your nails to shreds and forget about any and all distractions (cell phone) too. Give this movie your time and it will give you a nice return on that time guaranteed",2017

Having Mario Casas in a movie by itself is a reason enough to see this movie, and did he deliver! The acting is astonishing, this world deserves more Spanish actors, but the directing was a pure masterpiece. Orioul Paulo is a man to be reckoned with. Throughout the movie, the plot will take you on numerous emotional and moral roller coasters, and every time you think you know it right, the plot will mercilessly prove you wrong. I enjoyed the movie from the first seconds till the last ones. If you are willing to dive into the depths of Spanish thrillers, this is the best movie to begin your journey with.",2017

Oriol Paulo has become an official guarantee for a top Spanish thriller - I just hope it doesn't take him another 4 years to make his next film! With Hitchcockian moments (the blood dripping from the car....), escalating tension, and a constant stream of twists & reversals, ""Contratiempo"" is thoroughly engrossing viewing. The final twist is of the best kind: it absolutely floors you, AND makes you want to kick yourself for missing it at the same time. A must-see if you like the genre. *** out of 4.",2017
5,"SPOILERS It well enough acted and interestingly written, but why oh why did they make the 'twist' so obvious? The Mother and the ""exert"" who arrive are both of extremely similar build and wear similar glasses: it's like the transformation from Clark Kent to Superman, anyone who's observant must have seen the climax coming a mile away. I was actually thinking there must be some other twist, like it was the son in woman's makeup.",2017
10,"My first review - it's worth. I have always loved Spanish cinema and this film has defended all the good that comes from this country. A seemingly naive movie has turned into a whole mystery where nothing is known, but the most memorable is the end that left a big smile on my face because it is the biggest surprise I have ever seen in a single drama. Rating: 10 and recommendations that everyone who likes the surprise factor will be sighted by him. Bravo!",2017
8,"I saw the advertisements for this show and decided to watch the first episode through prodding from my sister, who was watching from an earlier time zone, and said it was really funny. After 12 minutes in I also pressed the ""this is really funny"" button in my brain. This show is an inspired idea coming from Henry Winkler and hopefully it's as much fun for them as it is for the viewers. I am impressed with all of them for taking this trip together - and on camera - at their ages. Especially William Shatner who is 85 y.o. The youngest of the four icons is 67 y.o. Their reactions and personalities on the show seem very genuine, which is priceless. I look forward to seeing the next episodes of their adventure together. I hope they can survive the entire month! Their personalities are all very large and very different from one another, and they frequently pit the athletes against the actors in conversations and it looks like they may be taking sides throughout their journey together. It's a lot of fun for sure.",2016
10,"The only episode/show that I have ever watched back to back in one sitting in my whole entire life. Pure genius. I'm sad there is only 5 more episodes. I would love to see seasons in Australia/New Zealand, Middle East, Africa, Europe and South America. Can the boys do another 5 seasons? Can NBC listen to the public opinion? I knew Henry Winkler is an incredibly humble and funny guy, William Shatner is the articulate philosopher, George Foreman is the gentle giant and Terry Bradshaw is the life of the party. What a dynamic group. And Jeff, well this kid will be a star after this. It's a riot, it's hysterical it's what the world needs. The cultural and personal shenanigans, bickering, laughs...nothing but good ole fashioned, feel good FUN.",2016

8,"I was not expecting much from this show, especially because it is basically a travelogue and it's all been done before. The unique aspect of the show is that the travelers are William Shatner, George Forman, Henry Winkler, and Terry Bradshaw. Oh, and Jeff Dye--a comedian with one television credit to his name. That Henry Winkler is the guy who was the inspiration for the phrase ""jumping the shark"" did not bode well. ",2016
8,"I am mostly a Game of Thrones/Tudors/Rome type of television watcher, but I happened to catch an episode of this last week and I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. I found it to be funny, entertaining, and somewhat informative. I found myself, as well as my husband, laughing robustly several times during the episode. The chemistry of the 5 stars works very well. This is so much better than most of the less than stellar shows on the major networks. (Bachelor, Big Brother, etc.) I hope the network gives this show another season or 2. Since catching the episode last week, I have watched a few more of them and I have to say I have found them all equally entertaining.",2016
10,"Funniest show I have seen in years, my hats off to Henry! Love the Show! Had me laughing so hard I had tears rolling down my face. Can't wait to see the next one. Hope they continue to produce more shows. It is informative, yet funny at the same time. The cast plays off of each other very well. It's nice to see another side of these guys. A bunch of guys having fun; its great! Better Late than Never!!! Great name for the show; I have said that so many times. But, it's nice that they are able to travel together see different places and have some fun before it is to late. So, if you get a chance watch this show; sit back, and get ready to laugh.",2016
10,"This show is by far the funniest show in many, many years. I loved every minute of each episode. The men each brought their own personality and sense of humor to the show. Many times I felt like I was there sharing each location. I can't remember the last show I sat watching in my living room all by myself and laughing hysterically. The episodes where they were eating a variety of very exotic foods was priceless. One of the best episodes was when they trekked up the stairs to see Mt. Fuji and were so overtaken by the view of the mountain that they broke into Amazing Grace. ",2016
8,"I actually ""laffed"" out loud at the antics of these guys. The only downer I see in the whole thing, is Terry Bradshaw. If they keep this going (which I hope they do), please replace him. He's absolutely obnoxious, just like he was when he was a sportscaster. George Foreman is fantastic as the straight man to the rest. And of course William Shatner is the know-it-all prankster, & Henry Winkler is just endearing as the fall guy. Hope they keep this going, & that the guys visit all the continents, including some off-beat places in our own U.S. Yes, they did the Orient part of Asia, but there's also Russia. I also like it because it gives us a little ""in"" about the culture of the countries they visit.",2016
10,"Oh my goodness, this is the funniest show. I have laughed so hard I had tears coming down my face and also got emotional at the soft moments. Please bring them back. Loved every one of the cast members. The best show ever. Did I say, ""PLEASE BRING THEM BACK"" To see these places through their eyes is a whole new way and whoever thought this up is a comic genius. The laughter that they experienced was contagious. In this day and age this show is exactly what the world needs. George said it right, ""It puts everything in perspective"". It shows how spoiled we are when you see how little a moment makes people happy. Thank you again. I cannot wait to see their next trip. There will be another trip, right????",2016
10,"Stumbled across this (too short) series and loved it! What a great dynamic - the ""cast"" was hilarious. The locations, beautiful. The experiences - wish I could duplicate them. The vast majority of the world's population can never hope to visit these places - experience the wonderful locations and cultures (including me), but what a way to enjoy the possibilities - with William, George, Henry, Terry and Jeff. I enjoyed every episode, and I'm sorry the series is over. I want more, and I can only hope there's more to come. There are so many fantastic places in the world - places the average person (like me) have never even heard of. The possibilities are endless, and I hope the producers, directors (and whoever is charge of the big bucks!) can manage to bring this back. Again, I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED IT!! Well done! So, like, let's do it again!!!!!",2016
10,"I really enjoy this series so far. I've seen the first 3 episodes and the guys are very funny and the chemistry between all 5 is great. I could do without the gross food scenes but the rest of the show is wonderful. Seriously, most people are disgusting ""Oh look its gross, let me eat that."" Ew! The rest of the show is fantastic! Love the humour. I hope to see more shows like this, people experiencing life and having fun. When I saw this show advertised I was surprised, the guys should have all been in a show together sooner. Its like watching my family go somewhere, the group is amazing together. Whoever thought of this is a genius! I don't want to ruin the show for other people by telling about any particular thing on the show but it is different and worth watching, I hope they make more. Just watching the group together is funny, they would be funny doing anything together. Even a boring library visit would be funny if those guys went, they just seem to have that magic together.",2016
10,"Such a shame this is a short season debut. The comedy, the warmth the adventures these celebrities have and show throughout each episode is just pure gold. This show grabs you from nowhere and places you in a feast of senses, humour, compassion, joy and such delicious shenanigans that you dare not look away from the screen for a second. Surely these adventures have to be continued with the same cast, we demand more episodes more seasons. This addiction you gave us needs to be fed NBC. It's a show that you probably would never think of watching , but oh boy when you do you will be thanking yourself over and over that you took a chance on this. These 4 mature, golden celebrities, try many things that your average 18 year old wouldn't, and it quite simply is hilarious to watch and to experience. Best thing I have watched in years. The season finale is next week and what am I going to do when it ends! Return soon and don't change a thing!",2016

They are all great and together they are fantastic, Guys, think about making a movie together, I don't usually go to the movies, too expensive but I'd sure pay to see more of you guys.

You represented our country in a good way and it was great.",2016
10,Funniest show our family has seen on TV in a long time. Our ribs were hurting after the first 15 minutes. Looking forward to the next episode. Whoever had the great idea to put these guys together deserves an Emmy. You can tell some Shatner and Winkler must know each other well. Bradshaw and Foreman each contribute in their own ways which are also funny. I have never heard of the younger guy but he seems to fit in well and he can keep up with the guys and keep the show moving at the same time. The locations may be planned but the comedy seems real. I hope that after they finish in Asia they go to Europe. I have already recommended this show to the people I work with.,2016
10,"Best show I've seen in a long time. This show made me laugh out loud consistently. I'm gonna make sure not to miss an episode. These guys are outrageously funny. They set up situations and make the most of them with the cast. William Shatner is the ""serious"" one in the bunch. Henry Winkler is the goofy nice guy. Terry Bradshaw is a red blooded American through and through. And George Foreman is the quiet guy who adds his own take on things. No two are alike. They all play such different parts but it all works.",2016

10,With a nice touch of humor you cannot come away from this movie without feeling a sense of accomplishment regardless of the actual outcome. The movie inspires you to reflect on any challenge we may have faced on our own lives and inspires us to actually rethink how we may have handled it or behaved differently. Taron Edgerton played a very believable character giving the audience a real sense at who Eddie Edwards really was and how he lived his youth through perseverance and fortitude by simply not giving up. The film cleverly portrays this very quickly through a brief introduction into Eddies childhood. The story is written well and the story really gives us a sense of who Eddie is and the drive to fulfill a promise to himself. Hugh Jackman brings a humorous side to the film with just enough serious touch that you do not loose sight of the significant effort that was made by Eddie Edwards. I was glad to be invited to a early preview and hope that all who see this film enjoy it as much as I did.,2016

(And if ALL of this sounds familiar, you need to drop everything and go see this movie immediately ‚Äì before it's too late!) The movie poster says ""Inspired by a Dream Come True"". That's appropriate (even if it's also a bit of a spoiler). In other words, this film is indeed inspired by a true story, but it's a highly fictionalized account of what really happened. There really is an Eddie Edwards who was nicknamed ""The Eagle"" and became Britain's only ski jumper in order to realize his childhood dreams of Olympic glory at the 1988 winter games in Calgary. Except for a few more details, that's about where the similarities between the film and reality end. Personally, I think the omitted details of Edwards' story are even more interesting than what appears on screen, but maybe they were left out to simplify the movie or make it even more of a crowd-pleaser. If that was the goal, mission accomplished! The filmmakers did, however, cast an actor who could act and be made to look like the real Edwards, right down to his gestures. It is impressive.",2016
9,"My husband and I saw this in a free screening prior to it opening for regular audiences, and I even wondered if I loved it so much because it was free, but I think I would have liked it just as much had I paid to see it! I do think that the movie benefits from being shown on a big wide screen with all the outdoor scenes - not sure I would have liked it so much had I seen it on a TV size screen. I felt all the characters were perfectly cast. While it may seem like a nit, the only annoying factor to me was that Eddie's glasses were falling down his nose the whole time - and while I know that was part of the character, it drove me crazy watching him!! However, the movie kept my interest the entire time, and was extremely enjoyable. By the end, I had tears of happiness streaming down my face - definitely one of the best feel-good movies I have seen in a long time!! HIGHLY recommend!!",2016
10,"I went in to this movie not knowing what to expect. I hadn't heard anything about the movie from anyone I knew, but I am so glad I ended up watching it. Eddie the Eagle, like most biopics, does not strive for historical accuracy, but rather tries and succeeds in tugging at the heartstrings. In a trending wave of serious, depressing, anti-hero, ""realism-pics"" Eddie the Eagle shines. This feel good comedy/drama was inspiring. Taron Egerton's portrayal of Eddie Edwards was fascinating and believable, not in the sense of historical accuracy, but rather in his ability to make the audience believe in the impossible and dare to dream. Even when everyone but your mom is rooting against you, you can still achieve your dreams! You can't leave this move not feeling good. It was a great movie, and more should be made like it!",2016
7,"Everyone loves a good underdog story, and sports films have always been a good avenue for those stories to thrive. I know a lot of people like to complain sometimes about 'biopics' and how they should be as close to the source material as possible, but I look at it a different way. I go to the movies for an experience. Whether that be to laugh, cry, smile, or whatever, I go for the experience. If a film would be better off taking plenty of liberties, I'm all for it. Eddie the Eagle definitely took that philosophy, and for the most part, it really worked.",2016

10,"I had free early preview tickets for this movie and forgot to use them. My daughter came home from school and told me it was released today and she wanted to see it. I was like what the hay. It was a surprise hit in my book. The casting was great, story flowed well, and the ending was a tear jerker. Was not a big budget, well advertised film, but sometimes those can be the most satisfying. I would highly recommend to anyone. One of the most enjoyable movies I have seen in a long time. This movie really exceeded all of our expectations I can't wait for the DVD. Hugh Jackman was fabulous the main character Eddie was perfectly cast. I'm not sure what else to say but his is a must see movie.",2016
9,"I was kind of skeptical about the film at first, based on it's name I expected it to be a comedy but it turned out to be much more than that. In some way the movie is inspirational to take on life's challenges to achieve one's goals and dreams. Based on a true story, the movie documents a personal challenges from personal motivations to bureaucratic by officials to ridicule and derision by team-mates that Eddie encountered and ultimately overcame to compete in the Olympic Ski Jump competition as the lone competitor in a field that the British are not known for. My only caveat with the film was that the producers faced certain logistical challenges re-creating the look and feel of the actual 1988 Olympic Winter Games in Calgary Canada so they focused a lot on close-ups and low-angle views which is understandable. Nevertheless I found the film highly enthralling and inspiring.",2016
7,"I've seen some sport films through the years but I've actually never seen one about ski jumping. Eddie the Eagle is the truth based story of the British ski jumper Michael ""Eddie"" Edwards who participated in the 1988 Olympic winter games in Calgary, Canada. Eddie has since childhood, dreamed of becoming an Olympic participant. When he gets older and is denied to compete in downhill skiing by the British committee, he decides to try ski jumping instead. The problem is that the Olympic games is one year away and Eddie has never before in his life tried ski jumping.

10,"I remember all the hype surrounding Eddie the Eagles achievement in compeating in the Winter Olympics.I don't really care how accurate aspects of the film are,its a brilliant piece of entertainment about overcoming unbelievable odds to achieve an ambition which took real courage and determination.One thing that the film got right was the fact that 'The Eagle' got an individual mention in the closing ceremony,possibly the only individual athlete ever to be honoured in this way. But that is the whole point about his story. Its about having the courage to see something through without all the sponsership and financial support which clouds all sport today.The story speaks for itself, this film is not a documentary but its a wonderful piece of entertainment .",2016

7,"So many movies have injected liberal amounts of post-modernist snark as of late. If done right the snark translates to layers and layers of humor and meta-humor that rewards repeated viewings. Deadpool (2016) certainly comes to mind as the strongest recent example. If done wrong however, it becomes an unbearable echo chamber of self- congratulatory wink-winks and nudge-nudges (Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp (2015) anyone?). Eddie the Eagle is not a snarky movie. It's unabashedly sincere and tenacious in its embrace of the inspiring no matter how corny.",2016
8,"After watching this film, i had a sense of inspiration. To think that Eddie (Taron Edgerton) would succeed in being a professional ski- diver in the Olympics with his qualities- No Chance! But Taron proved us all wrong in this Drama/Comedy film as he gives us an impression of never giving up, no matter what the consequences. ",2016
10,"When I was fourteen years old, I watched the Calgary Games and fell in love with the Winter Olympics forever. One of the reasons was all the hope and good feelings that those games brought. Eddie ""The Eagle"" Edwards had everything to do with that. If you remember those Olympics fondly I can't imagine that you won't love this movie. His is such a cheerful inspiring story. The film captures all of that. Taron Egerton, who looks nothing like the real person, transformed himself into the goofy guy we all came to love. Hugh Jackman is also great playing to type in a supportive father figure-ish role. I also like the way the filmmakers used the music and what I would call bullet time. If done right, the film would have been emotional already but those things really heightened it to make it one of the all-time great movies about believing in yourself. Fans of movies like 'Miracle' or 'Billy Elliot' should love it. I've seen it twice already. I can't recommend it highly enough.",2016
5,"OK, well, this is going to be a tricky review, folks, because this is a weird movie, very weird. A Cure For Wellness has the great merit of being different, and to reward the movie goer with something that stands out from the crowd; but, once you have appreciated this aspect, you might also want to be rewarded with a kind of content that gives the form some substance. And here is where A Cure For Wellness lets you down. I thought the first part of the movie was very good (rating: 8): you are simply smashed by the oneiric, hypnotic power of the images, by the stunning photography, by a breathtaking use of the camera, pretty good acting; and the intrigue created by the plot is such that you just keep asking yourself where this can reasonably go. That should have been the job of the second part (rating: 2) , where instead most of the potential built in the first half is wasted: the story, from intriguing, turns silly; the mysterious plot turns into a surreal Dracula movie which just does not make justice to itself.",2017
6,"Gore Verbinski has created a visually splendid thriller/horror film, which creates a wonderfully foreboding atmosphere. However, what could have been a great film is marred by a convoluted screenplay that falls to pieces in its final act, and is riddled with plot holes. I waited patiently for all the pieces of the puzzle to fall into place (and with the running time approaching 2 and a half hours, it's quite a wait), yet ultimately I was left somewhat confused and underwhelmed by how it all played out. ",2017
9,"I'll never understand why some movies end up rated the way they are. This is one of those movies. It's not groundbreaking. It's not mind blowing. But it is a great example of what a quality movie is. The acting is good to excellent. The cinematography and visuals are exceptional. The story is a little odd, but so what? Since when does a movie plot have to be within the realm of ""Normal""? It is what it is, and this one actually all comes together relatively well. The pacing, although a long movie, is actually pretty good. You'd think 2-1/2 hours is too long. After watching this movie, I'd have to disagree considering the fact that everything that happened contributes to the story and slowly builds suspense. I can see why some people don't like that, but it's unfair to rate a movie poorly simply because you don't like the style. It's not a frantic seat-of-your-pants thriller horror movie. Why do people insist on rating movies how they think they ought to be, or how they thought it was going to be, and not simply how it is?",2017

5,"""Do you know what the cure for the human condition is?"" A phrase we often hear in one form or another in this Picture, which Perfectly describes what this Film seems to be about, narrowed down to its Bone at least; totally in contrast to what the Official Synopsis says ""An ambitious young executive is sent to retrieve his company's CEO from an idyllic but mysterious ""wellness center"" at a remote location in the Swiss Alps, but soon suspects that the spa's treatments are not what they seem."" To tell you, the reader, as little as possible, if you are Watching this Film you are on a Hunt of a Visually Stunning and Sound technically Well crafted Film that sadly seem to lack Focus and feels way too long. What hurt my Love for the Cinema really Bad is that i was able to see through its flaws that this Film could have become a really good, even Great Mystery Horror Thriller, which i would have proudly given an 8/10 but due to its unforgiving longevity with many unnecessary ""filler"" scenes and over explaining where you don't need any explanation at all, Plot elements that could have been cut out of the Movie and an Introduction that would have benefited of being cut down to 5-10 Mins. With the Way the Movie has been Shot it either would benefit from being cut down to a Maximum of 110 Min's instead of 146, or becoming an 8 Part mini series, as for the simple reason that the film gives so much possibilities of where the Story could go but instead keeps teasing until the Unfulfilling Finally that looses its Impact for way to much going on before dragging us the Viewer to its Twist Ending that becomes weird when we are reminded of what was the whole Purpose our main character got to this mysteries Place, right before Finally hitting the Credits.",2017

I don't even know where to begin, sweet Christ Almighty. Alright, first of all, this movie looks freaking amazing, like jaw- droppingly amazing. Imagine the most attractive person you've ever seen, multiply that by ten, and that's what every frame, every shot, and every scene of this movie looks like; when the movie started I literally said out loud ""this is why I love movies!"" and then as the film went on I proceeded to moan audibly, worrying my parents, as my eyes lapped up the visuals. If Nicolas Winding Refn watched this movie, I have no doubt he probably climaxed numerous times because ""A Cure for Wellness"" looks this good; it's an eyeball stimulating movie, I'll tell you that much. Seriously, it felt like me eyes were making gentle love to the screen while watching this film, and I haven't had a good eye ******* in a long time. ",2017

Verbinksi's A Cure For Wellness strikes all categories on what a suspenseful ""thriller"" should be. I myself watch countless thrillers, as they along with horrors, are my favorite genre. Upon seeing the reviews for A Cure for Wellness, I was both disappointed and worried... I had expected a much more positive response, with not only a solid cast headlined by he greatly under- appreciated Dane DeHaan, but also a suspenseful and artistic director, in Gore Verbinksi. With that being said, this movie was phenomenal.",2017
10,"Can't believe all these bad reviews or the horrible percentage it has on this website. This movie broke all expectations I had and was filled with twists and turns that will leave your head spinning even after the film is over and it's been half a day. Before going into my review, I just want to address 3 annoying things I have seen in reviews. 1) First review I saw by Angry Joe on YouTube said that it was predictable from the first scene what would happen by the end. This is so untrue. I expected it to have some Shutter Island, Fight Club, split personality twist but that never happens. Instead you get more and more reeled into the character and all the mystery of what is happening at this facility. 2) Some critic on RT said it was a lot of unpleasantness. WHAT THE F**K did you expect? A happy go lucky movie with pleasant fun things in it? NO! Obviously the whole thing is about a guy losing his mind, so that is just in general an unpleasant theme, you moron. 3) Saw a critic saying it was over-produced. Apart from maybe one scene I can think of towards the end, it was not over produced. It was WELL produced which is very different. When I think of an over-produced movie, I think of almost every superhero movie recently that is plagued by bad writing and an overload of CG. This was nothing of the sort. Nearly every CG moment (besides the stupid face of a deer that gets hit by the car) looked stunningly realistic and was used at a moment where it was necessary to the artistic integrity of the film. This film is ART! ",2017
2,"A Cure for Wellness promised so much. It had an intriguing trailer and an intriguing first half. It promised to go down a similar lane to Shutter Island, where a mystery would be unfurled and explain the mysterious moments sprinkled throughout the film. However, as it becomes more absurd and more mysterious as the movie moves on, there comes a moment when realisation sinks in. Realisaiton that the story was not thought out, and it had come to an absurd turn that explains little, and attempts a feeble attempt at incestuous and immortal depth. Instead, it is a farce, riddled with silliness and questionable motives. Dane DeHaan shows poor talent in A Cure For Wellness and the character could have been more fleshed by any other actor. Jason Isaacs plays a similar role to the villain he is becoming accustomed to in OA, and the Harry Potter Franchise. Whilst he maintains a strong presence, it is becoming an eye-rolling ordeal. Gore Verbinski once made decent films, but he seems to be rolling down-hill with this tragic effort. A Cure for Wellness will leave nothing but a feeling of being cheated and shocked that something could promise so much, and delivery so little.",2017
9,"Had I known what kind of film (gothic creep) A Cure was, I wouldn't have watched it. Had I known Gore Verbinski directed it, I'd have eagerly looked forward to it, expecting something along the lines of the Pirates of movies and Rango. Instead, I was treated to a tour de force in cinematography, superb acting, and a tense and exciting ride. A Cure is not an easy film to watch. While it is not exactly full-on horror, it certainly ratchets up the tension with music, atmosphere, and uncertainty about what is real or not. It is a long film, but I never felt it drag or that any scenes were wasted. And oh what scenes! Something as simple as a car driving up a hill - stunning reflections glimpsed on the bonnet (hood). Half-face lighting highlighting the descent in madness - or not. Gorgeous architecture contrasting with sterile settings of a sanatorium. Hardly a scene went by that was not an iconic shot. DeHaan was perfect in the role, as others have mentioned reminiscent of de Caprio in Shutter Island. He held the tension between confidence and possible insanity very well, leaving you wondering which way the film would turn. Jason Isaacs was excellent as the doctor you suspected all along, but were you right? And Mia Goth (talk about nominative determinism!) brilliant as Hannah. I can't say I 'enjoyed' A Cure, but it's been a long time since I have relished a film so much for its filmic qualities. If you just want entertainment, this probably won't be your thing. If you are into film and want something a little unusual, I highly recommend A Cure.",2017
6,"Greetings again from the darkness. It might seem peculiar for the director of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, The Lone Ranger, and the Oscar winning animated Rango to be the driving force behind an atmospheric Gothic mystery-thriller, but Gore Verbinski seems to ignore any attempt to generalize or label his films. In fact, this latest film (written with Justin Haythe) attempts to challenge genre conventions by cloaking us in familiar themes and expecting us to be surprised by the late twist.",2017
2,"So I wasted a date night, on a Tuesday, on this movie. The commercials made it look like it would be a scary, mind-tease. Instead I felt like someone who sat through the most mind-dulling two hours. I not only wasted $8.50 per ticket on this, but a short amount of time out of my life, and away from my kids. The story line was all over the place. You never really got the point. Did the guy go mad? Did the guy with no face figure out how to live forever? How did they stick that huge ass tube down the one guys throat and have the flesh eating eels go through his system and him still survive. Was the girl really like 100 years old. Did we need to see her father finger her? Were his bosses in on this? How did we see someone that was dead living and vice versa? Why were all the nurses and orderlies so odd, were they dead, or undead? There is just too much that needed explaining. This movie is a waste of time. Please, save your time and money for something better. I heard Split was good!",2017

The board of directors indicates the young and ambitious executive Lockhart (Dane DeHaan) to assume his position and assigns Lokhart to bring the CEO Roland Pembroke (Harry Groener) back to the company to sign a merger. Further, the company is under investigation of the government and the directors intend to blame Pembroke for dirty business. Pembroke moved to an expensive spa in a castle located in a remote location in the Swiss Alps. Lockhart heads to the place by plane, train and a limousine driven by the local driver Enrico (Ivo Nandi). On the arrival at the spa, the attendant and the director Dr. Heinrich Volmer (Jason Isaacs) do not let Lockhart speak to Pembroke and ask him to return later. Enrico drives Lockhart back to the village but there is a car accident and he returns to the spa to recover a broken leg. Soon Lockhart meets and befriends the weird teenager Hannah (Mia Goth) that drinks a liquid from a blue bottle; and an old patient that tells how the castle was built on ruins of the castle of an evil baron that wanted to marry his sister to have a pure blood child two hundred years ago.

However,not enough was explained at the movie's conclusion and you were left with way too many unanswered questions! I am left longing for a complete explanation of the story line! A much needed and decent synopsis would be great at this point. I really did enjoy Dane De Haan's powerful performance. I was not familiar with him or any of the other actors before this film. Jason Isaac was very good as well,and Mia Goth reminded somewhat of Mia Farrow in Rosemary's Baby.I find it very difficult to discuss this strange movie without revealing spoilers, so I really cannot say much more about it.",2017

Immediately. The plot holes and ""stupid"" moments of this film are so numerous that I lost count and found myself enjoying it. We know the head of the institute is a mad scientist so why doesn't the hero see it? Why is the most significant room in the whole place secured with a lock that a shovel can remove in seconds? Why does the mad scientist allow the hero to wander around and get into trouble, again and again and again? Why doesn't anyone EVER investigate a Frankenstein castle-on-a-hill even as wealthy people that are sure to be missed are going there and disappearing? How does such a place exist in modern day Switzerland in the middle of one of the most busy tourist regions in the world? Wouldn't Samantha Brown and her Travel Channel camera crew have stumbled onto this place by now? If you're a hero and just escaped a madhouse, wouldn't you at least go a few villages over before trusting local law enforcement? If you're visiting someone and given a 3 page document to sign, wouldn't at least a few people bother to check out what it says before signing?",2017

Of course, it helps that the acting is so brilliant with top performances from the likes of Tom Hiddleston, Hugh Laurie, Olivia Colman, Tom Hollander and Elizabeth Debicki but a great actor needs a great script. The bedrock for this classy thriller is, of course, John le Carre, supported in the adaptation by David Farr. Susanne Bier's direction is a masterclass. The cinematography is stunning.",2016
10,"Though updated for the present time and reworked slightly, The Night Manager stays forcefully true to the characterizations and atmosphere of Le Carre's classic spy novel.

9,"At last a good old fashioned yarn where bad guys are bad and the good guy has a moral position. A flick through the average night of TV and the schedules are filled with low-cost reality rubbish, The Night Manager breaks the mold it has a good storyline, high production values, and a great cast. More like watching a Bond movie, for example, using three million pound plus speedboats to go out to a restaurant just to get a beautifully choreographed overhead shot framed against the Med. Certainly looks and, with its intelligent script, sounds more like a big budget movie filmed on location in Europe than TV series. What more do you want for your licence fee? Forget it is reminiscent of a bygone era it is entertainment. As long as it doesn't degenerate into an overlong series with filler episodes that go nowhere I will keep watching...",2016
1,"I wonder if I saw the same program that some of the other reviewers did. I haven't read the novel, but I was expecting something as clever as Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy which is among my favorite movies (loved the mini-series with Alec Guiness and Smiley's People). The plot of The Night Manager is so contrived and Tom Hiddleston's acting is so wooden - he has one look and it's a combination of conflicted and constipated - his other acting technique seems to be walking with great intent, which he doe remarkably well. I don't understand how Hugh Laurie's character is supposed to be so intelligent, cunning, and ruthless, and yet he accepts Hiddleston's character into his inner circle so readily? All these women are so ready to share their secrets and beds with Hiddleston as well? And, at the end, Hiddleston walks into the hotel where he used to work (again, walking with such intention with his forward leaning head, I'm surprised he didn't hit it on the glass door) and nobody recognizes him except the chef? This was such a waste of talented actors. I will admit, I watched The Honourable Woman with Maggie Gyllenhaal at the same time, which I shouldn't have as that is a nuanced, insanely well acted, and engrossing thriller. To then switch to the Night Manager was a letdown of Biblical proportions. Laurie should have just played Roper as House and that would have made it so much better",2016

10,"This TV series is the best ever adaptation of a John le Carr√© novel. The direction by Danish director Susanne Bier is sheer genius. She knows exactly when to insert a closeup of a single malevolent eye of Hugh Laurie, just to unsettle us. The casting is perfect, the script by David Farr is perfect, the direction, the story, are all perfect. Hugh Laurie is so brilliant at being a master criminal with charm that it is difficult to imagine anyone else doing anywhere near as well in the part of arch-villain Dickie Roper. Tom Hiddleston is a revelation. Even though he played Scott Fitzgerald in Woody Allen's MIDNIGHT IN Paris (2011, see my review), I must confess that I had never otherwise heard of him before. He seems to have 'come out of nowhere', nowhere being a long series of TV things and rather obscure productions one does not easily incline to see. But here he is, all super-starish, sprung fully fledged from the brow of whoever had the inspiration to cast him in the lead for this series. And then there is the amazing Elizabeth Debicki, lithe and beautiful and spell-binding. And then there is the truly wonderful Olivia Colman, one of my favourite actresses. (Am I allowed to prefer her even to Elizabeth Debicki? Am I mad?) With a cast like this, nothing could go wrong. And another of my favourite actors, David Hodge, with his look of earnest conscience, is in there too. It is all simply too wonderful. Nor dare I forget to mention the amazing Tom Hollander. Who could have imagined that he could so readily play a psychopathic killer? Once again, one cannot imagine any other actor having been better in the role of 'Corky'. This was just perfection, that's what it was. Tom Hollander has become so versatile it is almost scary. As he is so good at everything, I expect to see him come down my chimney next Christmas as Santa. This six-part series is gripping edge-of-the-seat stuff for every second. A huge budget was lavished on the production, with a great deal of use made of locations, namely Morocco, Mallorca, Zermatt, Egypt, the UK, and Turkey, and many aerial drone or helicopter sequences were used to great effect. TV series do not usually have that kind of money to spend. And it all paid off, every penny of it. This was truly TV drama of the highest imaginable calibre. This inside portrait of an international arms dealer's world, and the attempts to penetrate it, is riveting. Le Carr√© reminds us of the duplicity of all governments and venality of so many civil servants by showing the insider treachery of the Foreign Office and 'River House' mandarins in London, who, far from wishing to catch Dickie Roper and put him out of business, are actually supplying him with the very arms which he is selling to unsavoury people in the Middle East. So Tom Hiddleston and Olivia Colman, who are risking their lives to bring a monster down, are being blocked at every turn by the 'Establishment'. Alas, too true, too true. If you are the nervous sort, you won't have many fingernails left if you watch this all the way through. But it is a series of such rare excitement and spectacular impact that we can only cry out pathetically: 'More! More!' It is streets ahead of HOMELAND and any other possible competitor. It has style and brilliance like no other suspense series.",2016
7,"Very flash and dazzle television highlighted by attractive cast, exotic locations, and cloak and dagger plot.",2016
8,"Suave, confident and sexy, ""The Night Manager"" offers a spy thriller from an interesting perspective, the hotelier's. Often neglected and barely visible, it's quite the dynamic take on a thriller protagonist. Both Tom Hiddleston and Hugh Laurie carry themselves well, it's a delight to see them trade banters at TV mini0series while the visual takes full advantage of the exotic locations.",2016
6,From the start this looked superior to most British TV series which are light on budget and lazy in direction. A John Le Carr√© novel adapted at great cost seemed like a perfect mix for a short series. Very quickly I found that it wasn't quite short enough and they really dragged out some episodes. They could have told the story in four episodes and told it better. I haven't read the novel but the story just wasn't clever enough at times. The book probably explained things much better as was the case in The Little Drummer Girl which was the best spy novel I have ever read and incredibly intelligent.,2016
10,"I thought this was absolutely wonderful, and was especially impressed by Tom Hiddleston (such a superb, beautiful actor) and Hugh Laurie (brilliant in the 'evil role'). One thing: I did think that a pregnant Olivia Coleman was a bit of an oddity in the series, since I don't find it plausible that a spy would put herself in a massively dangerous situation when heavily pregnant.",2016

4,A 3rd class series with 1st class cast which is full of clich√©s and illogicality. ,2017
2,"The first three episodes were painfully slow. I had hoped they were leading to a complex story with some depth to characters and some surprises and twists which never came in my opinion. The acting was cheesy and I could not bring myself to like or care about any of the characters. The storyline became totally unbelievable in last few episodes but I struggled through to the end. I was hoping for something like the fantastic ""The Honourable Women"" but was sorely disappointed! I have never written a review on IMDb before but felt I should offer an alternative opinion to the generally rave reviews of this show. Even the great cast couldn't save the flimsy plot and poor writing. The Balearic scenery was the best part.",2016
6,"The Night Manager gets his kit off at every opportunity but is still shown as sensitive and empathetic towards women which his not a bad trick if you can pull it off. Mr H.Laurie is not convincing as a megalomaniac evil arms dealer(are there any other kind?)and in fact is rather hammy,which is a disappointment. At the very start of the first episode when Pine(Mr Hiddlestone - now promoted as the ""new"" Poldark"" who in turn was promoted as the ""new"" Mr Darcy...yawn,yawn) walks through a serious riot in Egypt it is clear he is not merely a hotel employee.Here is a man who is accustomed to being in the midst of anarchy and chaos.As imperturbable as Noel Coward in ""Our Man In Havana"" he strides towards the British Consulate. Clearly a person to be reckoned with. After that,Im afraid,things went a bit south for me. Various shades of crookery displayed by British diplomats,Spy vs Spy, typical le Carre minutiae regarding the S.I.S.'s different tentacles and rivalry and corruption at the very top of M.I.6. And these are just the good guys. Mr Laurie and his bad guys ( lots of requisite East Europeans included,natch) all overact like mad and it is left to the great Miss Colman to provide the only portrait of a believable human being as the woman who handles the material sent over by Pine. It must have cost a few bob to put together and doubtless the cast had a fine old time in Mallorca at the home of some multi - millionaire financier with links to the disgraced ""Kids Company"". Nice to see my licence money going where it is needed.",2016

5,"Maybe I was expecting too much, but I waited and waited for some kind of surprise or unexpected moment, which never came out. The story does not look as coming from Le Carre, as it is so simple and straight. Hugh Laurie sometime delivers some good baddie look, but he is not helped by the screenplay which gives him the usual ""The world is already a bad place, I am just doing my job"" lines to give him some substance. Tom Hollander is the only one delivering a believable, interesting and menacing character. I am sorry for Tom Hiddleston, who delivers a completely uninteresting flat Jonathan Pine, who is so lovable, generous, courageous and good at everything he does, that when the series ends I am not curious at all to see him again.",2016
1,I'm utterly mystified by the glowing reviews handed out for this unmitigated waste of talent and money.,2016
5,"THE NIGHT MANAGER seems to have a lot going for it - a big budget (enabling the action to be filmed in lots of exotic places such as Madrid, Mallorca and Morocco (standing in for Cairo), a good cast spearheaded by Hugh Laurie and current flavor of the month Tom Hiddleston, and a source-text by John le Carr√©, reminding us of those seminal adaptations of the late Seventies and early Eighties when Alec Guinness played George Smiley.",2016
3,"From the first second on - with the blonde British hero walking fearless through marauding foreign crowds - the whole show is like a pearl necklace of one trope lined up to the next. That makes everything following completely predictable ...if they set up a person as weak and likable suddenly without context, you know they just prepare for some drama in the next. By movie-logic these scenes then make sense. By real world logic pretty much everything that happens is absurd. Often they are just pointless - I don't get why every remotely female person had to beg the hero for sex on first sight.... without even a pretense for any reason or romance. The director tried to make up for it with blurry shots of touching hands and waving drapes on the beds.",2016
8,"Let's start with the title sequence...the best I've ever seen for any film or TV show. Perfectly encapsulating the background plot of what follows, items of luxury effortlessly morph into sinister weapons culminating in a crystal chandelier mushrooming into an atomic bomb exploding.",2016
10,"As Planet Earth I was released about ten years ago, a visual improvement could have been expected due to the use of advanced technology, but man, did they up their game. The camera-work and the use of music were both truly superb, as well as the editing in which different sub- segments were all synced so well with the narrating of it by David Attenborough. ",2016
10,"I have just finished watching the first episode on BBC 1 and I am amazed to find that Planet Earth II appears to have bettered the original! The photography is perfect and Attenborough's narration, both content and delivery, is unparalleled. ",2016

10,"The opening image of Planet Earth II contained the promise of everything to come. It was spectacular, it was beautiful, it was magical. ",2016
10,"One of the best documentaries I 've ever seen. Every episode is a new wonderful experience,getting to know the world that surrounds us. David Attenborough is the best narrator out there and this is his latest masterpiece. The crew has worked hard and managed to capture a large aspect of wild life whether it lives on a remote island in the arctic ocean or deep in one of the large human cities in India or United States of America. It shows that they put a lot of effort and time filming this under harsh conditions,but the close up captures of wild animals in their natural environment was worth the effort. Watched it already twice and will watch it again! This is something to watch again and again with your children, until the next Planet Earth arrives. Well done!",2017
10,Plant Earth 2 was everything you would expect and more. ,2016
10,"This is not just one of the best wildlife documentaries ever made - superbly filmed using the latest techniques and equipment ‚Äì it is one of the great achievements in any area of culture from this or any other year. Little else shows such skill and dedication from its makers, or is as moving in its sense of beauty and feeling of something larger than ourselves. ",2017
10,"It's a shame I can only give this breathtaking masterpiece 10 out of 10, it really deserves more. It is the single most astounding cinematic experience I have ever witnessed. The cinematography, narration, and score are hands down the best I have ever seen. Never has my entire family been so excited to watch the next episode of a program or movie.",2016
10,"I just want to say THANK YOU to everybody who was involved in the creation of this wonderful, incredible, breathtaking documentary! I forgot what it means to experience such genuine emotion of watching a movie! I hope that watching this documentary will help people feel the importance of all forms of life on our planet. Show it to people who forgot that nature is our native home. Show it to your children and they will learn to love our world. I'm sure that this documentary will not leave anyone indifferent. I am sure that this documentary will lift your mood and help you feel all the depth and beauty of our world. People, please, let's cherish and love our planet!",2017

10,This is my first comment and I hope I am not bungling it.,2016
10,"Planet Earth II is outstanding in every sense of the word. From the score composed by Hans Zimmer (Planet Earth II suite for anyone looking for the soundtrack) to the narrative genius of Sir David Attenborough, this documentary will leave you speechless and in awe of our wonderful planet. ",2016
10,"Planet Earth II is one of the few TV Series/Documentary that can, somehow, be appreciated by almost all the viewers, no matter their age, sex, religion or perception and ideas about the world. At the first sight, it may seem to be another nature documentary like others and yes, it is one of those nature documentaries, but it is the best one so far, from almost every single point of view. The viewer ratings don't lie, as you will know after you watch a couple of minutes of any episode of this documentary. Due to the new technology available, such as the 4K/ULTRA HD video & sound format and also thanks to the newest filming equipment and procedures of capturing videos and photos such as the drone-filming, Planet Earth II is far more better than the first Planet Earth. After watching the first series from 2006, it may look impossible now with this new TV Series to present something new and different, in order to capture the audience's attention. It is unbelievable how this new series totally differs from the first one and it really has such a unique and entirely new way of presenting us the beautiful Blue Planet, in a way that can make you burst into tears. To be honest, I was't expecting much when I first found out about the Planet Earth II release. And now, after watching it, I am fully shocked and amazed about how a filming and producing crew can somehow reach perfection in creating such a masterpiece, one of the best documentary of all times. This is a truly and undoubtedly must watch for every single person in this world who has almost one hour of free time to kill for watching one of the episodes.",2016
10,This is probably the most intimate documentary I have seen of our fellow species on earth. Awesome. After having a bad day... watch this. Your problems will seem insignificant compared to life in general. We may be the top of the food chain. but this will illustrate the type of struggles we had to endure to get here. Humbling. Young people need to know their place in nature.,2017
10,"Any rating below 10 is an injustice to this awesome documentary. I have never given anything a rating of 10. but this thing deserves more than 10 :) It is better than any action movie ever made.I have watched 3 episodes and I think everybody must watch this show, it is like your life will be incomplete without it. happy watching !!! :)",2017

10,It's difficult to explain the magnitude of this series' brilliance.,2017
10,"Having seen the first Planet Earth, I had lot of expectation from this one because Technology has advanced so much since then. But more than the visuals, I was somehow impressed by the compelling storytelling in all of the episodes. The Penguin one from the Island episode was amazing. But for me the best one was the from the Jungle episode involving Wilson's bird-of-paradise. The build up to that story and climax was just brilliant. Keep your ears open along with your eyes of this one. Sir David Attenborough's narration is just the perfect icing on the cake.",2017
9,"Sorry, folks, but I watch TV to be entertained. Particularly when I am viewing Sci-Fi shows, I suspend reality and accept certain premises that may be technically flawed. By doing so, I'm not over-analyzing every nuance trying to figure out if it's consistent with current scientific knowledge.",2016
7,Canada makes lite beer. Now it makes Lite Sci-Fi.,2016
10,"The premise of this show alone, is highly interesting and should peak curiosity by itself. The screenplay, cast, and ideas are so intricately developed, it makes the viewer feel as if they are there themselves. The plot of time travel is not a new idea, however the way it is tied in to this show is perfected making it completely captivate the audience. Furthermore, the mere pilot develops the characters so in depth that it draws you in so much more, while still leaving questions and secrets to be uncovered. What would happen if things were done differently? This is the question everyone asks but has no answer to. The writers of this show take this question and expand it on a much larger scale, where one change in the past can influence the present greatly. What amazes me is how much detail is put into this show. How would history be different if you changed what happened in the past? I guess you will just have to watch and find out. ",2016
6,"I know nothing new exists in this world when it comes to Sci-Fi and many of us very much enjoy the usual tropes that come with the genre. I am no exception to that and lapped up the first 20 minutes. What spoiled the show was the Delta force guy. Why the writers decided that the teams ""protection"" guy should be an utter halfwit is beyond me. I know it's a fantasy show but the idea that a world changing event would be entrusted to a guy that thought it would be fine to bring a Glock back to 1937 when plenty of perfectly good firearms already existed at that time and to then try and save the first good looking girl he sees from a preordained death is stupid in the extreme. Does Delta Force are highly trained professionals and know how to follow orders. Sure some of them might not be ultra bright but it is insulting to portray one as being utterly stupid. I hope that this is a one off and the show settles down as apart from this issue the show was fine.",2016
5,"In the age of Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones and wonderfully crafted Netflix originals, network television continues to hold its title for generating the most mediocre, almost-there content that can be imagined. Debuting last night, the latest installment of network mediocrity, Timeless, sought to ride the coattails of what is perhaps the latest trend in film, shows, and even books (a la the latest Harry Potter work) - time travel. It was this element alone that inspired me to fire up the pilot (the next day, it wasn't worth missing Monday Night Football over) and see what it had to offer. ",2016
7,"Overall, its a fun show. You can't take it too seriously, but its nice to watch for the adventure and the history. The time travel is pretty well done, and its nice to see their actions have real consequences in the present. It also does a good job addressing some of the obvious issues of time traveling when you're not a white dude. The characters are decent and entertaining, though nothing new. The actors do a pretty good job, and the storys okay if you don't pay too much attention. The show doesn't take take itself too seriously, and has a nice light-hearted feel to it. Its a good show to just relax with and enjoy the ride. Don't go in expecting high artisanal materiel, just enjoy the fun, charming, little time-traveling adventure.",2016
3,"**** Mentions plot details from the first 10-15 minutes of the 1st episode *** As a Sci-Fi fan, I really wanted this to be good. But the pilot devolved into lunacy almost from the beginning. It's no spoiler that it is about time travel. However, when you select a team (of three), for a time-travel mission to potentially ""save the world"", you would think that someone would take five minutes to provide them with minimal time-travel ""rules of engagement"" (even though someone with an IQ of 5, would probably not need to be schooled on the basics). Of course, rule #1 is: Take no action that might potentially alter the timeline. Yet, within minutes of arriving in the past, one of the three travelers (the requisite ""military guy"", sent to provide team security) proceeds to allow his libido to overrule any basic common sense, and suffice it to say, without giving away any of the plot details, nothing good comes from that initial, unnecessary, boneheaded move. All of this happens in the opening few minutes of the 1st episode.",2016

9,Of the new shows this fall I like this one. Time travelling trio goes back in time to stop some villain? from changing history. It's interesting to go right into these famous events in history - so far the Hindenburg disaster and Lincoln's assassination. Interacting with the protagonists and influencing the outcome makes watchable TV. Production values are good too with well done recreations that don't look cheap at all. Abigail Spencer plays a history professor and she looks a little older but she is convincing. Matt Lanter of 90210 is a cop. There are so many possibilities for scenarios and anything that makes people think about history is good. Sometimes time travel shows can be irritating but this one isn't.,2016
3,"The basic premise: there are two ""time machines"" one gets stolen, and an older, more basic one is used by ""the intrepid crew"" (core characters), to chase the thieves across time and space.",2016
5,"Timeless is a fabulous concept reduced to absurdity. The stereotypical unnecessary humor; uninteresting and unnecessary personal lives of the lead characters; quick one-liners rattled off so fast in dialogue that the viewer can't even understand what they are saying; implementation of the Rittenhouse conspiracy which is nothing more than a convoluted Bilderberg method of trying to add subplots because it is easier for the writers as opposed to explaining theory of time travel and the intricacies of it. Quite frankly, this series had great potential but the writing is deplorable as are the actors. I am starting to laugh at the constant facial expression of the Rufus character. His absurd expressions as if he is always in pain is deplorable. Timeless is a soap opera using time travel as a front. If you want to watch a terrific time travel series, watch ABC's 1966 series Time Tunnel. Despite its lack of technical accuracy, it was played and written totally seriously with understandable dialogue, focus on how and why the Time Tunnel was created, interesting explanations of time travel, good story line, no unnecessary personal details about the lead characters lives; great music, and focus only on the story line of the time, place, and events. Time Tunnel was quite intriguing to say the least. It represented the fabulous writers of the 1960's TV vs today's writers and their pseudo- adage, ""if you can't convince em' confuse em'."" - Ed Shifres",2016

6,"Frankly, in the first couple of minutes, I knew the premise but I enjoy a good science fiction tale. I thought they really did some clever stuff in the show and while the time machine itself is a bit hooky I still sat and it kept my attention through the whole hour. I thought that some of the twists they put in the show were very clever and the whole theme with the black guy was really well done I could imagine what it may have been like in 1937. It did miss a few things like them beating up the cops. If one believes in the time travel paradox they would not even be able to do that however if one takes this show as just a show and an entertainment one will enjoy it. I hope it doesn't get a quick demise.",2016

Yes, the CGI could be better, but it's not like it was deplorable. The story also seemed a bit rushed, too. Hopefully in the upcoming episodes we will get more in-depth storytelling.",2016

Before this can occur - the soldier attempts to change history because a woman looks like his dead wife. Now - if one guy does it and is bad, shouldn't your soldier have been the type who would know better? Apparently not. They should have shot him dead and continued the mission, but they don't, instead they shoot the plot and we no longer care what happens.",2016
3,"I wanted to enjoy this show. It is about history (my college major) and it is science fiction, which I've always liked. The villain Garcia Flynn and I share a last name, so I thought that was cool. I wondered how a Croatian like Goran Visnjic managed to get a Spanish first name and an Irish last name, but wasn't going to let a little thing like that stop me from liking the show. However, the show is so poorly written and so poorly researched that I cannot keep watching it.",2016
1,"I am a real fan of the time travel genre, if it is done properly, so I was more than willing to give Timeless a fair crack of the whip. Sadly, it failed on all scores. I didn't care about any of the characters, and the way they were assembled was simply ludicrous. You have to accept that the time paradox doesn't count in a show like this, however, there surely has to be some level of credibility if your crew are going to change events and realise consequences. Which is why the latter part of the story gets even more convoluted and even more incredulous.",2016
5,"This is a good show overall. However, the technical flaws really put me off. When the Hindenburg comes in, the sparks are supposedly caused by the dangling ropes being WET preventing a good ground for the static electricity. This is nuts. Nothing makes a better ground than water except for a rod driven in to the ground.",2016
1,"Tonight I watched the series premier and it will be the series finale for me. It was poorly written, completely unbelievable - I'm sorry, I've dealt with the USA's Homeland Security on numerous occasions (I can't divulge why, otherwise, I'd have to shoot you...LOL) but Homeland Security are not the sole arbiters of Americas final line of defense and security, especially in matters of the scientific - think the rhetorical question/joke about 'army intelligence?' The characters were unbelievable, ill-prepared, undisciplined and completely ill-informed about their mission. Yes, the show was ridiculous, infuriating, absurd and definitely un-researched. The writers need to read up on the theories of time travel and perhaps do a marathon watching of all three episodes of Back To The Future. In my book, ABAJAM Chronicles, Two Families Lost in Time, I took a quote from Albert Einstein - The distinction between past, present and the future is only an illusion; however persistent.

I could listen to my own heart beats while watching this film. It has never happened to me before when I saw a film and I was touched immensely. The film took me back to my roots and streets where I grew up. I am from Pakistan and I have been living in San Francisco for the last 15 years. I come from that part of the world where this story takes place. I grew up in streets like the streets of the movie 'Lion'. I have met many children who collect garbage to make a living and are lost in the streets of this universe. They sleep alone on card board boxes at night and when you look at them , there is a question in their eyes. The world has forgotten about these children and there are thousands of these children on the streets of India and Pakistan. Do you really know what it feels like when you are only 5 years old and lost in some crowded street in a big city and do not know how to get home? To the boy who played Saroo (Sunny Pawar), I want to give you an Academy Award. The film grabs you from the beginning as it starts out with showing a beautiful relationship between two brothers who are running on a train track. The actress who played mother (Priyanka Bose)touched my heart. Her performance is breathtaking. The way she looks at her sons, shows you how a mother pours her heart with love when she looks at her children. There are no words to express that feeling and actress gave her full self and emotions to play this role from young to old. It is commendable and her acting moved me and reminded me of my own mother. There are so many things which I think my mother does not know about me but the way she looks at me, I know she knows. ",2016

9,"To put it in simple words, ""Lion"" is a journey that grabs you entirely ; whether you want it or not, you are a part of each and every scene. Exactly like the hero, you find yourself having visions of a past that you think you have forgotten, you long for something more and you dig for something deeper. This is a journey back home, filled with emotions, hard decisions, and an infinite willingness to reach somewhere safe.. Simple story, dream like sequences and real characters that are aware that ""there are no white pages"" but that in a way, there is always a black ink somewhere that you can use to finish the endless books that you have in your head. A gem and must see. Highly recommended for the cast's performances, the musical score and the emotional layer that refuses to let you go even after the movie had ended.",2016
10,"This film was for me one of the most gripping and compelling films I have ever watched. Nothing was dragged out the whole film was to the point and from the moment it started to the moment it finished I was engrossed with the story. I found it emotionally harrowing but went to see it with my sister during the BFI film festival which I think made the emotional side harder as you could relate to the pain you would feel if it were to happen to you, afterwards we both walked home in silence still playing it over in our heads. Also true praise for the composer the soundtrack was exceptional - so beautifully written and in perfect harmony with the film. A truly exceptional film, this story will stay with me forever. The casting, the story, the cinematography and the amazing music was done perfectly and I actually cannot fault this film. It was truly mind blowing and makes you appreciate how lucky you are to have whatever it is you have In a seriously humbling way. If you appreciate good film, this one, is a must.",2016

9,"This film is an emotional true story set in the mid 1980's, based on the novel ""A long way home"". Staring Sonny Pawar as a 5 year old boy ""Saroo"" from a destitute Indian village. He and his older brother scratch a living selling stolen coal, their mother is a labourer, their lives are extremely tough. ",2017
10,"I first saw Lion on a whim 3 weeks ago and didn't know what to expect as I hadn't even seen the trailer but I was so incredibly moved by Saroo's story that I decided to watch it again 10 days later. It's the kind of film that stays with you hours or even days after you leave the cinema. It's not just an amazing true story but the acting is superb, the musical score haunting and the cinematography stunning. My decision to see it for a second time was partly due to how much I'd enjoyed the film but also in case I'd missed something of importance through all the tears. Well that didn't work out well as I cried even more the second time round as I knew the significance of certain scenes. ",2017
9,"I loved this movie uncritically. It's only upon ""thinking"" about it as a work of art that my reaction to it (10) is revised to 9. Some bits are too long (what else is new), and the real-life personages that we see in a video at the end look more interesting than their actor counterparts. The child actors who dominate the first part of the movie are wonderfully effective.",2017
5,"Lion is an a amazing story of an exceptionally lucky child grown up to be a man. Lion is not a great film however. It becomes overbearingly melodramatic and overwrought in the second half. I felt like screaming at the main character, go to India and see your family already! This would have been a good documentary. Spare us the Aussie attempt at angst, it just doesn't work. Here we have a lucky young man with a loving family, all grown up in the ""lucky country"". What's the problem? He can figure out where to go in India to see his birth village, but we have to endure an hour of film with him being moody around his supportive girlfriend and family. Talk about manufactured drama. The scene with Nicole Kidman and Patel seemed pointless - just a contractual opportunity for her to show off her acting chops and make this sellable overseas. Don't be fooled. This is a great story, but poor filmmaking in my opinion.",2016

7,"I'll start by saying that I'm an incredibly emotional person myself, which means I'm capable of feeling great empathy for most of the characters on screen, but this time I could clearly hear the whole crowd in the projection room crying their hearts out, or at least feeling sad for that little, genuine and brilliant kid played by Sunny Pawar, whose first performance on screen was pure gold.",2017
6,"""Lion"" (2016 release from Australia; 118 min.) is ""based on a true story"", we are reminded at the beginning of the film, and brings the incredible story of Saroo. As the movie opens, we are in ""Khandwa, India, 1986"", and we see 5 yr. old Saroo and his older brother doing whatever they need to do to get by, hustling and bustling. During one of their outings, they get separated and Saroo mistakenly ends up on a train bound for Calcutta, 1000 mi. away. He desperately looks for his mom and his brother, to no avail (for one thing, the boy speaks Hindi and not Bengali), and eventually ends up being adopted by a couple in Tasmania, Australia... To tell you more of the story would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.",2017
8,"In 1986, in Khandwa, India, the 5 year-old boy Saroo (Sunny Pawar) lives a very poor but happy life with his mother Kamla (Priyanka Bose), his older brother Guddu (Abhishek Bharate) and his younger sister Shekila (Khushi Solanki). Kamla works carrying stones during the night shift and Guddu also works in the night in the Central Station. One night, Saroo insists on going with Guddu to his work and does not resist and sleeps. Guddu leaves Saroo sleeping on a bank I the station and asks him to stay there until he returns. However the boy wakes up in the middle of the night and decides to seek out his brother in a train. He sleeps again and he wakes up in Calcutta, West Bengal, and 1,600 km east of Khandwa. Saroo does not speak Bengali, only Hindi, and lives on the street of the big city. One day, a young man brings Saroo to the police station and he is sent of an institution for children. In 1987, Saroo is adopted by an Australian family and moves to Hobart, Tasmania. He is raised with love by his foster parents and one day, he goes to an Indian party promoted by his Indian mates from the university with his girlfriend Lucy (Rooney Mara). He tells the story of his childhood and triggers the feeling of missing his family. Now Saroo becomes obsessed to find his mother Kamla and his siblings. Will he succeed in his search?",2017

8,"Whenever I wander in the streets of the Moroccan Medina, I feel at home. There's that strange mixture of various fragrances floating in the air: spices, kebab, frying delicacies (not much different from these appetizing jelabis), sea spray from the fish market, tanned leather from the shoe shop and this whole conglomerate smell outsiders or tourists might feel stinky, but as far as ""my"" senses are concerned, ""there's no place like home"". I didn't pick it, it picked me.",2017
9,"It has been mentioned on this page that one of the writers is ""Saroo Brierly (novel)"". His book is not a novel. It is a biography. I am from Khandwa where the boy in the story (Saroo Brierly) hails. My residence is just about two kilometres from his mother's residence. A few years ago I met him 'accidentally' and spoke to him briefly. I was totally excited to meet him. He does not know his mother tongue Hindi. He talks with an Australian accent. His book 'A Long Way Home' is worth reading. In the movie his adult role is played by a 'white' man. It should have been a 'brown' man to reflect real appearance. The child actor who plays the role of child Saroo is in fact a child who was washing teacups for a living in a roadside snack shop on the Khandwa-Indore road. His acting and voice are true to what would have been that of a local boy. Saroo's life has touched the hearts of many. In fact his story was topic of a sermon in our little Church in Hyderabad",2016
5,"I found the movie to be good, but it does not spend enough time in some area's of showing what this child went through, put more detail into what had gone on, it is based on a real life story, so they show him playing cricket with his new Mom and Dad - a year later, then no reason is given in adopting a second child who clearly has issues. They fast forward 20 years ?, Hello this is like so many Hollywood movies that are one dimensional - what happened in the huge gaps of time, the ending explanation with text is too fast, just like the story. Cole Smithey is the only critic on Rotten Tomato's who makes sense, he earns his pay check the honest way, Richard Roeper says it best, fast forward two decades, Hollywood does this way too much in taking a book and turning it into a bland movie, he unfortunately is like most critic's, they get paid to make us waste our hard earned money at the box office, would Siskel and Ebert - agree, he new them ? I say most critics are probably a sell out to Hollywood in the greed factor, independent film's are much better as they are not controlled by this crap.",2017

He plays Saroo Brierley, a young Indian man who was separated from his family when he was a little boy, funneled into the Indian orphan system, and adopted by a loving Australian couple. He longs to return to India to see his birth family again, but is torn between wanting to reconnect with his roots and remaining loyal to the people who raised him.",2017

1,"Cabin Fever is just another one of those movies where studio executives thought, ""Hey, the original was good so why not milk the f*ck out of the name and release heaps of garbage, call them sequels, and the money will come."" Now this reboot comes along with the exact same script as the original so I figure the execs were just like, ""F*ck it, why even try?"" And it shows. The good news is that this isn't a theatrical release - it's limited on-demand or something so thankfully a majority of people won't be aware of this abomination's existence. But for those who are, let me affirm your suspicions: this movie blows.",2016
1,"While not a shot-for-shot remake (the angles and cinematography are different), this remake uses the same script as the 2002 original with slight alterations. Despite this seemingly pointless exercise, I was prepared to give it a chance and not hate it for failing to aspire to anything original. I'll go on the record saying I -wanted- to like this film, despite some unease after watching the trailer. I'm sad to say it fails to live up to the original in nearly every regard.",2016
3,"I'm not the one to hate on horror movie remakes I actually enjoy watching a classic remade for the modern audience. But that's only when the director can create a new modern twist or add more to what the original didn't have like what Zombie did for Carpenter's Halloween. But the remake of Eli Roth's Cabin Fever is just one of the most pointless horror remakes I've ever seen next to Psycho. The story of the movie is lame. It's everything you seen in the original just with different actors in these scenes. You actually know what's coming next. You even know what the characters are gonna say next. There's nothing new added in the directors own vision. It's the same Dog death opening scene. The scene where one of the characters gets his hand attacked by Dennis is the same. Even the camp fire story is the same. The only difference is the ending of the movie, which is not half bad. The characters are very unimportant to this movie or at least they felt like it. You don't pay even a minute of attention to them because, well they are supposed to be the same as well and they make the same dumb choices of survival as the original. The blood n gore effects seem to be up higher than the original. But it might it some gore lovers we do see a lot more blood all around in some scenes especially in the bath tub scene we see even some skin coming off.",2016
3,"So I take most movies as what they are, entertainment. But sometimes you can't help but get annoyed with stupidity/lack of common sense. This ""update"" really just ""modernizes"" the original Cabin Fever staying pretty true to the story line a some minor changes here and there... I was alright with this movie and tried to put up with it but Eli Roth has an ability to make his characters seem like the DUMBEST living sentient beings in the world. In the world of Horror movies, I understand, the people have to be lower than average intelligence and lack common sense so that the plot will progress cause instead of knocking on the door of a trailer so you can use the phone for help, the character decides to ""peek"" in through a window in stead EVEN tho all the lights are on... so the inhabitants obviously don't listen to his pleas for help cause they seem him as a sexual predator.",2016
5,"This movie should not have been made. It does nothing new, different or even remotely better than the admittedly average original. Had it been Evil Dead-remake caliber, we would have been in for something special. But everything from the acting to the gore has taken a considerable hit with this remake as to effectively make it Cabin Fever-lite. This movie doesn't even try to be original in its retelling of the film, as the same basic set-up (and even some of the dialogue) has been reused and recycled to ill-effect. Worst part of it all? Save for a few of the actors, the performances were atrocious. Honesty, I have seen found-footage films with better acting than what some of these no-talents pulled off. The movie was limited in its vision, and toning down the gore does a disservice to everything that was good about the original film. It's just basic in almost every way, and really is a waste of resources. If you didn't believe Eli Roth was a hack before, you certainly will after watching this mess. Not recommended, even if you have absolutely nothing else to watch.",2016
3,"I'll admit I've never been much of an Eli Roth fan. The original Cabin Fever was a pretty bad movie but I wouldn't even recommend this film to Eli Roth fans, as it is a pretty pointless remake. Fans of the original probably should stay away.",2016
1,"Cabin Fever (Remake) Horror) I kind of went in to this film thinking that this would be told in a different way, maybe in a better way than its original film. Now I'm not normal a El Roth fan but even I've got to notice this film has to be his worst ever film.",2016
1,This my review of Cabin Fever (spoiler free),2016
2,"I wasn't expecting this to be better than the original or even a good. I expected it would be a little worse but still entertaining. This movie was just horrible. It clearly, IMHO, was the fault of the director though. Deciding to take the original script, which was campy and silly, and have his actors reenact it seriously was a huge risk, which I appreciate, but it failed miserably. I liked them changing the one cop into a woman, because I thought that put a neat spin on the dialogue, so I will give the director that. But the acting for this movie felt like a high school play, where none of the students have a future in entertainment of any sort. It felt like each actor realized that the director was making terrible decisions so they gave up on the project, and establishing any kind of on screen report with the other actors, and instead just gave auditions for their next projects, like a professional athlete on a losing team just trying to keep their jobs for next years. skip this movie, and remember the director's name so you can avoid any future movies",2017
8,"Boy oh boy do people hate remakes. This 'Cabin Fever' remake has a rating of 3.7 on IMDb which is exceedingly low, usually saved for only the most vile, terrible and unwatchable films you could imagine. Is it a bad film? No. Is it a remake? Indeed. I would go out on a limb to say over half the people who have rated the film haven't even seen it, and have simply come to the page and clicked '1' in protest of the film even being made at all.

4,"If the purpose of that remake was to strip all the funny scenes off the original to make a decent horror movie, then it failed miserably.",2016
2,"I went into this expecting to see something different or even better than the original. But alas, this fails in every sense of the word...fail. Lack luster rewrite, production, acting and direction. And plenty of mistakes throughout the film that had me thinking ""Were they high when they made it?!"". Goofs such as the dog attack of the girl. The guy gets back to the cabin and sees the girl has been ripped to pieces...but...at the end of the film during the credits we see various body bags of which one of the bags contains this same girl who appears to have been miraculously put back together?! And without even looking close you'll see that her body bag appears to have a shape of a full formed body?! Another goof, one guy is getting chased through the woods and takes a piece of his arm flesh that happen to fall off and sticks it to a tree and an effort to throw his chasers off his trail. So as the guy sticks this piece of flesh onto the tree...it immediately falls off, but when his chasers get to this tree, of course the piece of flesh is seen hanging off the bark of this tree?! OK then in the end of this film we see what appears to be a young college girl looking at her friend's (The girl who was the first to contract the flesh eating disease)'Facebook' page. As she flips through the photos she see various photos of the trip our Cabin Fever protagonists were on. She then is horrified to see photos of the girl's bloodied legs, then a photo of bloodied shredded mouth and a photo of one of the guys bringing down a shovel to he face. The problem with this is, the photos were not in order (Bloodied shredded face from a shovel to the face, then a photo of the guy bringing down to shovel to her face). This was impossible because it was obvious these photos were screen shots from the film itself and were NOT taken by anyone, including the girl herself who happen to have a camera in the shed with her, at some point in the film, from outside the shed we as the viewers can see 3 flashes of a camera emanating from a small window, but this occurred long before the shovel scene.",2016
2,"'Cabin Fever' was released back in 2002. And again in 2016. However, about the only thing about the 2016 version is that it forces us to ask that most existential question: how can something be exactly the same yet completely different? The 2002 film has gone down as a cult classic. And for good reason ‚Äì it's awesome! Okay, if you're into cheesy horror films with teens dying in various gruesome ways then it's awesome. It takes the ‚Äì oh so familiar ‚Äì premise of a group of annoyingly beautiful teenagers going on vacation to a remote cabin in the woods and then meeting a sticky end. Nothing new there, but it's just the way it's done. It knows it's not original and often plays on the clich√©s you'd normally find with the genre, plus it throws in some truly random and surreal moments just to keep the audience on their toes.",2017
1,"The original was well thought out in every way and an excellent gore horror movie. This remake, however, is terrible in almost every way. They literally copied almost line for line the original, but the acting, choreography, and almost everything else is just terrible. I have no idea how they could screw this movie up so bad. Do yourself a favor and watch the original (2002), which is produced and directed by Eli Roth and then if you want a pathetic laugh, watch this one.",2017
1,"The original 'Cabin Fever' is one of my favourite movies of all time. Despite the mediocre acting, dumb characters and clich√©d plot, I love it for its dark sense of humour, bizarre and surreal moments, grisly special effects and some genuinely effective and creepy scenes. And even though the sequels were awful, I still held out hope that the franchise would make a comeback. But not like this.",2017
1,"Very rarely turn films off, but had too with this one. Annoying and I mean really annoying clich√©d characters. In this day and age of technology, I cannot believe the writers made the characters so stupid - duh I am in the middle of mountains and woods and cannot get a phone signal etc. Also had the usual clich√©d 'red necks' (yawn), you know have a kid who is a bit 'wrong', look a bit dishevelled and who are completely indifferent to helping! The deputy sheriff who turned up was a)thick and b)obviously not a cop who would have instantly picked up that was something was wrong and not been so completely unprofessional. I got well over halfway cringing at the bad acting, incredibly annoying character development and awful clich√©s before reaching for the stop button. Absolute rubbish, avoid...",2017
4,"The question posed by this version of ""Cabin Fever"" is ""why?"" Why remake a relatively recent horror film that, while it was nicely done and announced the arrival of a filmmaker (Eli Roth) lots of people had high hopes for, wasn't particularly groundbreaking? I thought I would find the answer in watching the remake, but as fine as this iteration is, it doesn't quite manage to make a case for its existence in a world where the original is still relatively fresh. The cast, the direction, the effects, and the cinematography are not appreciably better nor worse than the original. The story is almost identical, with a few minor variations. (The local hard-partying deputy sheriff in this version has been gender swapped, but otherwise performs the same function as in the original.) The rough spots of the narrative have not been smoothed over -- in fact, they tend to stick out more here than they did before. Even in the original, the rapidly devolving situation the main characters found themselves in and their reactions to the threats they faced came off, at times, as a bit abrupt. That's true here as well, only more-so because the somewhat higher production values make this feel more naturalistic and realistic. The character contrivances stick out more, and the eccentric nature of the townsfolk our city- kid anti-heroes are surrounded by seem even less convincing than they did in the more stylized (and decidedly lower-budget) original.",2016
4,"The very first thing that came to mind when I stumbled upon this 2016 remake of the 2002 ""Cabin Fever"" movie was ""why?"" I am not overly a fan of remakes in general, but remaking a movie as new as ""Cabin Fever"" was just even more puzzling to me than remaking older movies.

I also incredibly enjoyed the intro sequence.",2016
10,I actually thought this film would be bad. Like most other video game movies I thought this was going to be a massive flop and just suck. This movie broke the video game movie curse with style. WarCraft surprised me even though I am a WarCraft fan.,2016
4,You will see many reviews by movie critics that are too negative and many reviews by fanboys that are too positive. I'll try to look at this movie from the point of view of a long time Warcraft player as well as someone who might be unfamiliar with the source material.,2016

10,Hello. ,2016
8,"First off, i would like to point out Duncan Jones has made another fantastic flick. Better than source code, but me personally i loved moon so.... Warcraft isn't good enough to beat it lol. So Everything about this movie felt right. And i would like to point out this movie is about the warcraft storyline (First game) Not World Of Warcraft. The acting was good, the pacing was great. The CGI was amazing! Gul'dan was an awesome villain. Never heard of Daniel Wu But i feel like he will be voice acting more characters soon. I love how they wear that ridiculous armor that a normal person can't stand up in. Lothar was an amazing main character, and I only know Travis Fimmel because he's in the show vikings but i feel like if the rest of the critics like this movie this could be his breakthrough movie. If there is a sequel then i would definitely go and see it. And lads, The Video game curse is broken! Hopefully Assassins Creed will live up to the hype! Fans will love it, people who like lord of the rings or the hobbit will love it, just regular people who has never played WoW will love it! All in all, i think that the hype was well worth it and it is definitely going to be a recommend for me! After you have seen Captain America go see Warcraft, you wont regret it.",2016
3,"I should start by explaining that I am not a fan of comic books, movies made from comic books, nor movies that have a comic book type story, with the utter and complete lack of plausibility in every single scene. I do like magical realism, and fantasy though. This movie had a few good elements. Some of the giants were cool, and the costumes were probably the best part of the movie. ",2016
10,"I don't want to give away anything, but my god was this movie amazing! The motion capture was superb, the acting superb, and the plot itself was great. For the Warcraft fans you will see plenty of easter eggs that will make you grin or laugh. Over all it's what of my favorite movies I have seen this year.",2016
10,Watched this movie in a IMAX 3D theater. The sound makes it well worth seeing in a theater with a state of the art sound system. The Orcs are believable from the start. Well rounded characters with great motivation. The motion capture work by the actors was a work of passion.,2016
10,"Just seen it with a bunch of friends and it was amazing. My friends who came with me aren't even Warcraft fans and they even said they can't wait for a sequel, they said it was nothing like they expected, which is another shitty fantasy movie. They were on the edge of their seats the whole time and wanting more! Whenever they'd show Easter eggs in the background i'd go nuts and they had no clue why but they were too busy being into the movie to care to ask. I CANNOT WAIT to see another one of these movies!!! I even noticed a lot of people outside the theater who have never played the games or know anything about it, loved it. I even talked with an older couple for a good 10 minutes who loved it but didn't understand a few things and i cleared it up for them, they were very thankful. They were excited for another movie too!",2016

3,(I labelled this 'Contains Spoilers' but I am not mentioning anything in particular. Someone might disagree so I figured safety first.) I grew up playing Warcraft II and III extensively. When I heard a Warcraft film was in the making I thought this to be a good thing. There was so much material to draw from. So I went to see it at my local Cineworld on the opening day (30 May here in the UK).,2016
1,"Yeah so ill receive many glares at this review but i can only be honest with my opinion here. Having watched this movie and upon ending seeing hundreds of people around me applaud it left me in total bemusement! Perhaps i was over expecting for this movie but besides the really well made CGI, i was left in utter disappointment. I mean, how can we as movie lovers and somewhat ""part time critics"" actually completely ignore that this movie was not well made?? I get that we're lovers of Warcraft and its massive franchise as well as having been so attached to its characters for so many years just as i have been, but to say that the movie was brilliant is absolutely misguided to the fact that the acting was one of the worst i have ever seen in any movie ever made. Not only that but there was little to no thought at all put behind fight scenes. Did we all watch the same movie or am i missing something here? Surely fight choreography could have been taken seriously? Having spent loads of money on CGI why not add a little diversity to a battle? Whoever swung a sword first would defeat his opponent...zero blocking, zero shields used...why did any of them have shields anyway?? Scenes were rushed in and rushed out, the rookie Madge was so badly played by someone who can barely act. Please re-watch the movie and look at his facial expressions or even his acting skills for goodness sake! This disappoints me because it was like ""okay we're going into this movie and we're just going to love it because its Warcraft and we've been waiting for this all our lives"". Give me a break! The potential this movie had for so much more is crazy and yet we all turn a blind eye to what matters most about a movie spectacle all because we're thinking emotionally. Sorry but i enjoy watching a well made movie and this movie was far from well made. #notsorry",2016
9,This movie is incredible. After seeing the first movie I have to say we will definitely in the oncoming movies see a rising Arthas fall to evil. Incredibly well done. A look into the lives of our famous Warcraft characters had me immersed and I was in love with the cinematography. I cannot wait to see Medivh & Sargeras in the movies. I wonder when we will get to see the drama between Illidan & Malfurion. I can't wait for the next one so excited. Thank you for an incredible movie. This movie is incredible.

3,"Casting is bad and acting is horrible! Come to think of it, why is Travis Fimmel always acting as a thrift store version of Johnny Depp, even in Vikings? Characters are flat and uninteresting. Everything is happening way too fast! Things that would otherwise need ages to happen, happen in just one or two sentences. Didn't bond with any of the characters, as the matter of fact, got annoyed by most of them. Clich√©s and tropes all around the movie, and i mean that in a bad way.",2016
3,"Here in Denmark, Warcraft had its premier today so obviously I flocked to the cinema to watch the movie. And the movie turned out to be exactly what I expected. The film looked and sounded wonderful (I'm already thinking Oscar nominations for visual effects, sound editing, and sound mixing), but the story was weak and the characters vanilla. The CGI, which I had feared, turned out to be pretty gosh darned good (especially in relation to the orcs). The acting department of the film was not anything unexpected with a few decent performances and otherwise plain and wooden acting that seemed to gloss over the otherwise dramatic and interesting situations that some of these characters were thrown into. The largest issue with this film however is the weak story, the unbelievable screenplay, and the fact that the movie relies on the audience having previous knowledge of the Warcraft lore (which I don't).",2016
3,"Did I miss the post-showing brief?! Little exposition leaves non-WoW playing viewers in the lurch; characters, locations and the very crux on the film ‚Äì the Fell ‚Äì are given very little explanation of base-building. ""Our world has been destroyed"" feels cheap and lazy for the whole Horde-invading premise. This poor foundation made the remainder of the film totally uninteresting to me. ",2016
1,"No character development or world building of any kind. No explanation for why anything is happening, and zero originality. Just terribly directed CGI battles and laughably generic fantasy tropes with one of the the most anti-climatic endings I have ever seen. Nothing gets resolved, and the entire movie is just a pointless waste of time. I find it both hilarious and sad that so many fanboys and little kids are rating this awful production so high. If it didn't have the 'Warcraft' label attached to it, no one would be rating this garbage anything above 2 stars, let alone even bother seeing it. This movie completely bombed in the US. Unfortunately, enough fanboys flocked to it's theater showings in China to warrant a sequel.",2016
3,"The epic battle at the center of ""Warcraft"" isn't the clash between humans and orcs. That's just what takes up roughly two hours of screen time. The true conflict comes from filmmakers trying to tell a story with soul and struggling against the inherent ridiculousness of the movie. Despite the noble effort of director Duncan Jones, who helmed the lower- budget sci-fi wonders ""Moon"" and ""Source Code"" , Warcraft just couldn't save itself from its unconventional and poor story tale.With its meticulously detailed realms built out primarily on soundstages and enhanced via CGI during extensive post-production, ""Warcraft"" aims for fresh and eye-popping and yet ends up shopworn and rather tacky. I am totally disappointed by Duncan Jones 'Warcraft'. I would give 1.5/5 for this heartless movie without any soul.",2016

2,"Bad Moms (2016): Dir: Jon Lucas, Scott Moore / Cast: Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, Kathryn Hahn, Christina Applegate, Jada Pinkett Smith: Bad movie plainly with a gripe about the tiresome schedule of motherhood. Mila Kunis as Amy Mitchell is the one passable character in this garbage. She caught her husband engaging in Internet sex so she kicks him out and discovers her schedule getting tighter. She makes friends with Kiki, played by Kristen Bell who is meant to be quirky and funny but just comes off as plain annoying. Kathryn Hahn as Carla advocate the need for sex within nearly every word that emerges from her mouth and it grows old quick. Christina Applegate and Jada Pinkett Smith are a total waste as antagonist school board bullies intent on pushing their agenda to the point of even stashing marijuana in the locker of Amy's daughter. The premise is rushed and the structure is predictable and boring. This is bad in more ways than one with two directors committing to a choppy and uninspiring job with production values straight out of the worst of direct-to- video bargain bid deals. Sure, it has a worthwhile message of the stress of motherhood, especially those balancing a job as well but the results here are embarrassing. The film concludes with the actresses sitting with their mothers discussing their upbringings. That is better than anything that appears in the film. This is clearly a film aimed at mothers and for them I say, good luck. This film is lackluster with no sign of an existing screenwriter. Perhaps the mothers could have gathered and wrote something that wasn't this bad. Score: 2 ¬Ω / 10",2016

1,"I honestly don't know what to say about this horrendous, terribly unfunny movie except I wish I could get my money and time back for the waste that was this movie. Here is a suggestion - watch the movie before you release it. And, if it is supposed to be a comedy, make sure the movie makes you laugh. I know for a fact that none of you rich movie producers and stars watched this crappy film. And, if you did and told Mila Kunis that she was funny, I have to say, shame on you for lying to her. And Mila, if you watched this movie and still let them release it - you are a moron. The funniest part is when somebody says a funny word about their body parts and it just wasn't that amusing. I guess the other two people in the room didn't think it was very funny either because I never heard one person laugh for more than a moment. I think I laughed more while watching ""Hannibal.""

I doubt whether the writers have actually met mothers. Do they even know their own mothers? I laughed because I was EMBARRASSED. Like, wow, has the world come to this? Please make this movie again but with actual characters and an actual premise. Make it somewhat believable or at least make it funny.",2016

The whole film was nothing - well, at least the first hour, I just couldn't watch the rest of it.

If you removed the near constant crude comments about sex and sexual organs as well as the profanity there would be maybe 15 minutes left of the show. The men are characterized as morons, the 'moms' as clueless, disorganized wimps except for the female co-star. She is a sexually aggressive piranha with no filter. If the part had been played by a man who groped and made sexually suggestive comments towards women you'd see women up in arms crying about sexism. They would be digging in their purses for their therapist's emergency phone numbers five minutes in. But it's okay for a female lead to portray this and men should be okay with it? Double standard there? The 'children' in the show are portrayed as disrespectful and patronizing towards their parents with no consequences. I've been searching for an appropriate description of this show and it is 'mind filth'. I do believe this is the worst movie I have ever seen. Ever.",2016

This movie is hilarious regardless of what sex your are and being a single dad I can also relate to some of what was being said. At the risk of sounding chauvinistic (which is not my intention) this is a raunchy male sex comedy starring women. The thing this has going for it over most movies like this is that the message doesn't get lost in the comedy and really helps add to the overall enjoyment of this.

10,"You need to see this movie. That could be this entire review, but I think I should describe how amazing this film is. Unlike most summer movies, the writing is fantastic, keeping me and the rest of the people watching with me attached to the movie and its characters even when they are just talking in a diner or something. Also unlike most other summer movies, the movie does not attempt to create artificial tension in the form of fast cuts or stupid action scenes, it creates tension in the form of dialogue and sometimes in the form of brilliantly filmed action. It should be noted that the cinematography in this film is truly amazing. The cinematography captures the desolateness and sadness of the area of West Texas that the movie is set in. There are also many wide shots, which looked like they were filmed with drones which also added to the beauty of the filming. The music also adds to the western feel of this movie. The writing of this film is where it really shines. The writing is captivating and it is so natural, for the area. The banter between both pairs of characters (the brothers and the rangers) is very entertaining in that you can almost feel their relationship and the history of it. Also, I have to say, the writing for the side characters, who are only in the film for their respective scenes is even better. This is the first time I have ever cared about some random waitress who is only in the film for 90 seconds because their writing is masterful. Also, the acting is definitely some of the best I have seen, Ben Foster and Jeff Bridges both really shine in the film because of their stunning acting. The acting helps in that when Chris Pine and Ben Foster are mid- heist you can really feel the stress when they get into situations that one or both of them are not comfortable with. In closing, this film has amazing writing, cinematography, acting, pacing, everything. This film is just beautiful and you really need to see it, like yesterday, it is easily the best film this year and a major contender for Best Picture, Best Director, etc.",2016

I truly hope that this spurs more films like it though. More well crafted movies that actually have characters you can get invested in.

The film tells the story of Toby (Chris Pine) and Tanner (Ben Foster), two bandits who make assaults on bank boxes and their executioners, the film works on this quest for cat and mouse of the two nuclei . The film tries to pass a moral about not being villains or good guys, in the western, these concepts does not exist, there is only who draws the gun first, the film is great at doing this, even if it happens in the current times, we also have brushstrokes about seeing all Points of view and a criticism of the abandonment of the cities of the interior that are still sunk in the economic crisis of 2008. The photography is great, full of aerial plans, with a palette of colors that pulls red, the climate is hot, photography Is urban and at the same time gives a complete sense of solitude, with a spectacular soundtrack, full of country, you want to pack and move to Texas, the track gives the tone of the movie several times, can even play once or Another at wrong times, but it is always a treat anyway. Chris Pine does a good performance, nothing special, he fulfills his role, Ben Foster is well out of tune, his performance is bad and it is not the movie, the gold here is Jeff Bridges, who Acts more physically with his face, full of postures, while sitting, walking, looking, he is a legitimate cowboy, does not deserve the Oscar, but deserved the indication.

The locale and time frame of this modern crime film/western is similar to ""No Country for Old Men"", but, despite the fact that I admire the work of the Coen Brothers and Cormac McCarthy, I think it is a much better movie. It is less contrived and Jeff Bridges is allowed to remain true to his character. Although actually filmed in nearby Eastern New Mexico it presents a moving portrait of the realities of West Texas. The poor white working class, which never heard of ""white privilege"", the predatory lending practices of local banks, the resentment of the descendants of the Comanches ""lords of the plains"",and the ethos of the Texas Rangers. At the same time it manages to spin an excellent action adventure yarn without drowning the movie in car chases and gunfights. Jeff Bridges is excellent as the old Texas Ranger, as is his partner a half Mexican half Comanche played by Alberto Parker. Chris Power and Ben Foster are terrific as the two brothers one desperate, the other crazy who come up with a pretty smart but very risky plot to right an old wrong. Two cameos by a couple of tough waitresses are wonderful. The script is understated, witty, and deals with a panoply of social issues without being wordy or preachy. The direction is crisp and focused. The cinematography make great use of the spare dry Southwestern landscape. I believe you will enjoy this exciting and moving film.",2016

Hell, even a small time investor would have sunk the 40k into paying off the back taxes so long as you tripled his return (which could have been done in less than 3 months considering that the movie states that they're making 50k a month off of the oil) In the end, the plot of this film is just a very cheap excuse to promote very real and very serious issues that many people are facing in this country. I just wish they had been as hell bent on making the plot as believable as they were in trying to get their political points across.",2016

I kept hearing positive reviews of this film, and it stayed at 100% on rotten tomatoes for awhile, so I was hopeful. In addition to the positive reviews, I thought Ben Foster, Jeff Bridges, and Gil Birmingham together couldn't a bad film make.

If you can suspend disbelief over the ludicrous plot then what do we make of the rest of the film. Jeff Bridges does an amateurish impression of Marlon Brando in the Godfather with his mouth stuffed with tissue so that you struggle to fully understand a single sentence he says. How this film scores a review of 8.2 beggars belief and makes me lose all credibility in review scores on this site. It is currently scoring higher than 'No country for old men' when it's not a patch on that film.",2016

A very simple story line, and little insight into the brothers lives, its as if you are waiting for the movie to start getting tense, but next thing you know, its the end.

Jeff bridges, Ben Foster n Chris Pines got into the characters. Its a solidly crafted, well-acted western heist thriller. The film stuns with its cinematography. The sunburnt desolate Texas backdrop creates a very nice visual palette. The colours look great. The lime green Mustang really stands out as a result. The long landscapes shots were awesome.

When i heard a TV show is coming, i thought that they will not be able to pull off the madness, the pacing, the characters etc, so, they will change many things.

I can write a million things about the changes they made, which ones i think work and which don't, but it doesn't matter that much. I can write about how good Cassidy, Jesse and Tulip were on the TV show (they were great), but it doesn't matter to me that much either. The pilot was a pretty good episode on its own, fun, crazy, fast, intriguing, with good characters and a great cast, cool music, nice photography and direction, good writing etc. However, what truly matters to me, is that the love of the creators for the source material(the comic book, duh), was apparent everywhere and all the time. The pilot was made of love. They seem to know the comic book, to understand and love it, and to really want to make this adaptation work. Judging from the pilot, they did.",2016

Unfortunately, Preacher deviates so much from its origins that the only thing recognisable about it are the character names.",2016

Then watching some crazy woman having a fight in a speeding car through cornfields before she makes a bazooka with some soup cans and tin soldiers and blowing a helicopter out of the sky...okay, are you still with me...if you are we then head to Russia, for about 2 minutes...then we are back in the USA watching some guy with a mouth like a baboons backside talking to the preacher..wow, I'm exhausted!..oh and did I mention Tom Cruise explodes!! ..and that all happens in about 20 minutes...I'm sorry, I need a pill and go to sleep...stay tuned..not!...I'm sure by the other reviews, this is obviously something I've missed out on and I apologize for my ignorance hence my score of 5...because that's where I feel I am...stuck in the middle...somewhere.",2016

4,"Question: how did they manage to enlist Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon as producers and still deviate so much from the source material that it's become a completely different story altogether? The characters' names are the same and some of their traits as well, but their overall personalities are hopelessly divergent. Not that it would matter too much if the TV show had managed to be entertaining in its own right, but that's the rub here, isn't it? The writing is simply a hot mess, with characters and story lines thrown in randomly and huge pacing problems. For instance, how are people who haven't read the comics supposed to make any sense of the Wild West flashbacks sprinkled in every now and then? Their inclusion makes zero sense. But generally all the characters behave unnaturally, they contradict themselves and the fact that som eof them are angels, or vampires, or any other odd creature is poorly explained and poorly used.",2016
1,Preacher is one of the best graphic novels... ever.,2016
2,"First off let my start by saying that Garth Ennis's Preacher is my favorite comic ever and he has since become one of my favorite comic writers (the other being Warren Ellis). A Preacher TV adaptation had been in the works in one form or another for years now, but it was never a done thing until recently. When the first rumors first surfaced I was rather wary and feared the changes they would make to the source material, and even more so when I heard that it was being made by AMC, which has a poor track record when adapting comics (The Walking Dead barely follows the comic, and it changed a lot of things), but my wariness turned into dread when I found out that the person behind the adaptation was Seth Rogen. Absolutely nothing in the entire season actually happens in the comics (well, except for some of the Saint of Killers origin story -and even that was somewhat changed- and the fact that Genesis merged with Jesse, but the circumstances of the merger were completely different). I get it that apparently they meant this season as a kind of ""prequel"" to the comics, but Preacher didn't need a prequel, specially not one that made fundamental changes to all the characters and their relationships to each other. They changed Jesse's backstory, they depict him as a (mostly) dedicated preacher that wants to do right by his community, who uses the Word of God to help the people of Annville. They show him following on his father's footsteps as a preacher, when he was nothing of the sort (he was a Vietnam veteran). When the comics begin he was pretty much done with being a preacher (he was coerced into doing it actually) and his entire flock was burned alive when Genesis merged with him. They also show him as a big shot bank robber (along with Tulip), when in reality they were little more than car thieves. They changed Tulip to the point of her being unrecognizable as the character from the comics. First they make her out to be some kind of badass assassin, capable of bringing down a helicopter with a rocket launcher made from coffee cans, while when we meet her in the comics she is running away from her first botched assassination attempt (and while doing so she comes across Cassidy, who was sleeping under a tarp in the back of a truck she steals). She also tries to be cute, funny and sexy but she fails at all three, she instead comes across as annoying and totally unlikeable. Everything she does is completely uncharacteristic to the Tulip from the comics, who even goes so far as to have sex with Cassidy (presumably to spite Jesse), who she actually despises and distrusts in the comics. The first time we meet Cassidy he is fighting a group of vampire hunters (no such thing, vampires were apparently unknown even to an organization as powerful as the Grail) and then jumping off said plane in broad daylight. He should have burst into flames but he doesn't, he even survives the fall and proceeds to eat a cow... He pretty much walks around in broad daylight through the entire season, and he hardly ever wears his sunglasses. In the comics he never takes them off (until the last or second to last issue) and there's a reason for that. Also, on a more personal note, I can barely understand what he says 90% of the time. I know that he is supposed to be Irish, but he should tone the accent down a bit, he needs subtitles more badly than Arseface. Yet another thing they changed was how the Word manifests itself (no red eyes) and even how it works (the whole ""got to hell Eugene""). They also changed the characters relationships to each other. The guys (Jesse, Cassidy and Tulip) didn't know sheriff Root or Arseface (who looks like crap by the way, he is nowhere near as hideous or deformed as in the comics) and they most certainly didn't know Odin Quincannon, who doesn't come into the comics until MUCH later and who is nowhere near Annville. In short they changed pretty much everything that made Preacher what it was, the show is missing its actual characters, its profanity (there was hardly a page without a f*ck in the comics) and its plot. Maybe they'll stop pissing all over the source material in season 2, but I doubt it, and even if they do they've already made fundamental changes to the main characters's personalities and backstories. Comics fans should stay away from this turd and beg that Rogen doesn't also ""adapt"" Ennis's ""The Boys"".",2016
3,"I knew that I had to lower my expectations, that a TV show of the Preacher could not be as much fun as the comic series. But after 4 parts I'm really disappointed. The TV show didn't made just a terrific road-show to a static boring one, the hole coolness of Jesse Custer, his tragedy is lost. Instead of a cool XXX kicking guy we have brooding priest. No fuXX you communism lighter, no Duke, no redemption for Tulip for leaving her (unwillingly), no love for Tulip... The preacher in TV has nearly nothing to do with the comic and failed to do something new cool stuff. I can't understand the hole lot of good ratings here even from people who know the comics? Where is his mission to find God? Where are his redneck relatives who forced him to be a priest? Why they changed his Father? His Father would never have beaten him like his TV dad in part 4.",2016
3,"I understand that the comic had its fans. And, while I haven't read the comics, I have a strong suspicion that this serial suppository doesn't live up to it. Tasteless and poorly executed, this show is boring, at best. At worst, it's gratuitous violence, wooden acting and cheesy writing on display. It's difficult to care about the characters; they all seem to be very one dimensional. Tulip is irritating to the point you wonder why she's even in this show. Cassidy is the only character who has potential, yet the writers waste it. The preacher and other characters are just devoid of any development. Don't waste your time watching this stinker.",2016
4,"I'm confused about this show. First of all, I find it boring. And the writing is well, novice. You have a guy who is a preacher for a church he's trying to get going as a promise to his dead dad. He was also an ex criminal and his tough as nails girlfriend wants him to come back to a life of crime. Then there's a vampire being hunted by... Vampire hunters. Seems very basic fan-fiction uninspired ho-hum plots. Like ones any of us could think of and put together over a few missed work days, when we had the flu. This is surprising, considering that the source material was so incredibly unique and out of the ordinary. ",2016
2,"I'm a big fan of the comics (I own the entire series) and I'm extraordinarily let down. Essentially what has happened is that the creators of the show have taken every character from the series, used a very loose interpretation of them, and dumped them all in the same place and written their own story. I see VERY few semblances of the original storyline and character motivations in the show, personally I think that the show's writers found a good excuse to produce something with a lewdness/violence shock factor and hope that alone will get them viewers (which by the show's 8.6 rating, it must be working). Shame on Seth Rogen for taking part in this, if he is a comic fan then someone should kick him square in the nuts for betraying his own.",2016
1,I gave it a try and I guess it was just too clever for me. It just annoyed me to the point where I honestly hope it fails and the creators don't ever get a chance to put out such garbage again.,2016
4,"the series hugely disappointed me it is a great way to waste anyone's time i was expecting it to be a great series like Breaking bad etc. but wow!! I don't have any words. the story was not well explained and directed. Everybody were on their periods when they make a series and you watch it's first episode and it leaves an impression, it left an impression on me as well, i wanted it to be good but to tell you the truth it was not, how much i wanted to lie about it, it did not, i tried my best to like this series but no they kept making it worse and worse. the did not explain how tulip lost the baby. cassidy's story why the eff is eugene there! yeah they might explain it in the next season but why the hell they did not in this. no one did anything in this season except for that preacher's secretary she did poop a lot warning. don't watch it.",2016

I did not think I was going to like it while watching the first show, second show I warmed up a little and by the 3rd show, I was totally hooked.... Having a show centered around ""the bad guys"" is interesting... and this family is amazingly good at being really, really bad.... yet believable as they do all the normal things any family does (i.e. cooking, cleaning, rules in the house etc.) The characters are so believable.... I think that I have known someone like each of them, but putting them all together makes for a dangerous group... The flashbacks that explain how each of these people became what they are is so insightful. The casting is perfection......",2016
10,"When I watch TV, I just look to be entertained, hopefully with engrossing story lines that are well acted and well produced.

Just entertain me for an hour and help me relieve the stress factors of everyday life and make me forget for an hour that I have to get that laundry done or pack that lunch or write those checks. ""Calgon, take me away."" This show delivers. To all the people comparing it to the movie, I've seen the movie too. It was definitely awesome. So is this show. Apples and Oranges.",2016

Go check it out I guarantee you will enjoy it and want more each week. Even though it's on TNT it still should get a look because I don't think I've ever enjoyed a show from them and I'm really into TV shows especially the new ones. So like I said just watch first couple episodes of you like any of the shows I've mentioned in the beginning.",2016
7,Without losing a step the Australian hit film Animal Kingdom got a new location to southern California where Los Angeles takes the place of Melbourne. But even the family name Cody remains the same and the plot structure of the film the same. Whether it can last as a television series is open to question.,2016
9,"I saw the two hour premiere on TNT I personally believe this could be one of the great shows in the making. I loved all the characters they're very rich the fact that the story is based around this seventeen year old kid is pretty cool as well. The kid has a hard life to start out with then gets thrust into this whole other world that's beyond his capacity level. Through tough circumstances he is reintroduced to his grandmother and uncles that are on the other side of the law and to see if he'll stay on the right side of the law or be corrupted and follow in his family's footsteps is very intriguing. Ellen Barkin won me over in the first episode when she told ""Baz"" Scott Speedman's character to stop being a wussy by playing both sides and start leading. And she told Craig her other son to clean the dog stuff up from her driveway as she walked off. All I can say is Smurf rules. I love Shawn Hatosy and Scott Speedman they are excellent actors and it's cool that they found something that's really edgy. Daniella Alonso and Molly Gordon are a very nice touch they are very talented actresses and pleasing to the eye. All in all I suggest this show to all it had a strong showing and it'll be great to see if they can keep it up hopefully for a very long time to come.",2016
8,I gotta say I had heard good things about this show but never really tried it until a marathon came on tnt one day and I was spellbound by what I saw I loved the story .most. of the characters and the action if you can handle graphic violence and strong language this is a very good show worth watching.ps also sex in some episodes . but the show is fantastic and I highly recommend it just give it a chance you wont see another family like these guys probably but its a true real family with good values on doing for family and you can always come home no matter how much you screw up in life thanks tnt for the entertaining programing,2017
8,"""TNT's"" new series ""Animal Kingdom"" is one that pushes the limit of cable TV it's a brash, provocative, and outspoken family crime drama that takes no prisoners. Based somewhat on the 2010 film of the same name, the series follows the life and crime adventures of one southern California family. The head leader is the tough and sexy cougar mother and grandmother Smurf(the still sexy Ellen Barkin)who helps run the show of money, bribes, heist, and criminal jobs with the help of her sons and the one that is the standout to me is the adopted one Baz(Scott Speedman)and enter her young hormone driven grandson Cody(Shawn Hatosy)who joins the crew after his mother dies from a drug overdose. And boy I must say this series is well spiced up with plenty of vices like sex, drugs, and family drama really those themes top the blood and violence of the series. Really this is one cool wild kick butt California sun and ocean series.",2016

Fans of the film should welcome a series with all that TV has to offer in the way of story and character development.",2016
3,"Animal Kingdom (TV series), for the most part, seems to be a poor but edgy retelling of Oliver Twist. Ellen Barkin's character (aka ""Smurf"") is essentially ""Fagin"" and ""J"" Cody is essentially Oliver Twist (the young new orphan facing hazing). ",2016
1,"This series had potential, but the gay and lesbian BS is being hurled at us again. After the last episode or two its not worth watching anymore, its just too scummy. Ellen Barkin is disgusting in this role. You just feel dirty after watching her. It has a good idea with a crime family but the characters are so flawed with their behaviors you just get disgusted by everybody except the kid. The seen with the two 70 year old women making out did it for me, seeing that horrendous display on TV is a sure sign of the downfall of our society. The writers writing this crap in are screwing the show up and driving would be fans and ratings away from their show.",2016

10,"This show is so tight. Ellen Barkin totally nails it in the gangster grandmother/criminal role. All the actors play their roles to a ""t."" I don't know what makes this show so freakin awesome, but everything just flows perfectly. It kind of reminds me of a more gangster version of 90210, that whole Southern California vibe, kind of soap-opera-ish but in a good way, but with way more drugs, sex, violence, all that good stuff, etc...I know that all might sound stupid as hell, but this show just nails it. It is character driven, which is why I like it the most. It's kind of like Point Break 2.0 in some ways, which I also loved, the whole daredevil element added to it. I actually purchased all of these episodes so I could watch them whenever I want on the big screen. It's just the perfect show to sit back and chill to after a hard day's work and be entertained. I love it! Cannot wait until Season 2. Excellent job TNT! *Stands up and applauds for 10 minutes* You freakin nailed it!",2017

10,"This is by far my favorite show since Breaking Bad. The show is too new and hasn't been given the rating it deserves. It not only is a fast paced action series, but also a very smart primer on what I would have to call a ""criminal procedural"". Unlike Game of Thrones the main characters stay intact (GOT major flaw was killing off the Starke family and bringing one back from the dead),but not so much with those they deal with. This is a criminal family made up of surfers/adrenaline junkies and if you are looking for something refreshing, this is it. One thing that really impressed me was how each character has his or her unique flaws and strengths and the rest rest of the characters understand that, which makes them a formidable force, when they combine their talents. While many may dismiss the show as being for stoners,surfers or long hairs in general (ie: far from politically correct),to do so is a huge mistake. Although it will attract those type of watchers, this is a very smart show and provided the writers keep on pace it will soon bust 9 on the IMDb scale.",2017

The chemistry between the characters, development, music, pacing, animation, everything was absolutely in chorus in the most beautiful way. I cannot even compare this to Studio Ghibli films, not because it's better or not as good, but because it is just a movie of its own caliber.

7,"As an avid follower of the works of Studio Ghibli, this film had much to live up to, especially considering its deeper themes and the exploration of a different, more subtle sort of romance between two individuals separated by time and space. Unfortunately, this film turned out exactly as I expected and feared, with an interesting storyline and basis, yet the characters, dialogue, and overall crafting of the story itself detracted from the overall quality. I will focus mainly on the negatives in this review, as there are a plethora of other reviews that seem to only focus on the highlights.",2017
10,"Your Name is a lively combination of romance, identity, and culture. I went into the film with a very little understanding of the plot's complexities. From the trailer, I assumed Your Name would be an anime Freaky Friday love story. The framework of the narrative certainly fits into my initial assumption. Yet, there is a multitude of undercurrents in the film which make Your Name stand out. For starters, Your Name constantly changes themes and mood. Often, I found myself laughing and, a few minutes later, would suddenly be on the verge of tears. The movie's eclectic flow makes for a constantly engaging experience. The Freaky Friday element is roughly half of the film's two-hour runtime. In fact, a plot twist in the film literally took my breath away. Your Name is the rare film which combines overwhelming variety and makes everything fit organically. Through variety, the anime earns a conventional ending between protagonists, Mitsuha and Taki. While body switching is the plot's main intrigue, the film adds complexity through its exploration of Japanese culture. Japanese gender identity is explored with such a masterful hand. In subtle strokes, the viewer understands the sheer contrast in the lives of Japanese men and women. For example, a group of men have a crush on a female co-worker; Mitsuha, in Taki's body, simply initiates conversation with the desired woman and, with ease, sets up a date. When Taki is back to normal the next day, his male coworkers all line up disgusted by his act of group betrayal. The scene effectively demonstrates the strength of the herd like quality of gender in Japan. It's no surprise then when Taki, in Mitsuha's body, finds such humorous wonder in the breasts he suddenly gains. A contrast can also be noticed in the struggle between the past and present. The present is Taki's experience of Tokyo. Likewise, the past is illustrated by Mitsuha's familial duty to her small town's local shrine. In other words, the film merges Japanese spirituality with modern sensibilities. A desire to escape and return to the country define the film's ecliptic take on Japan. Mitsusha is your typical country girl with a thirst for a life in the city. Meanwhile, Taki finds beauty in Mitsuha's country town. The viewer amusingly experiences each setting (Tokyo and Itomori) through the unique lens of the protagonists. Ultimately, a comet and local god guide the distant figures into a surprising collision course. As a result, fate is sealed by the two somewhat metaphysically dissimilar sources. The forces of science and divinity augment Your Name into making the seemingly fated connection all the more plausible. The film is a testament of the ""opposites attract"" sentiment. In summary, the film has a real beating heart. I will end my review saying Your Name is the best looking animated film I have ever seen. The colors are always pleasingly vibrant. Additionally, all of the scenes are lovingly rendered and pulsating with life. I haven't walked out of a theatre with such a positive perspective on life in a long time. If you live in a city, you ought to take the time to experience this anime masterpiece.",2017
10,"This film will leave you speechless - it is quite simply one of the most beautifully crafted films I've ever seen. The animation is breathtaking and possibly the most beautiful animation ever put to screen. There really are no words to capture exactly how it makes you feel because this is simply a film that will move you in inexplicable ways. Sit down, enter the world that Makoto Shinkai has presented to us and soak in all of the magic. Un-be-lievable experience!",2017

5,"This movie will please those people that have that teen romantic side. That side that says that your love is somewehere on the world, and you will be together by some sort of mystical or non-conventional way. If you don't have that teen side don't watch that movie. Don't get me wrong, It's well made. But the plot falls short, it misses the opportunity to talk about more interesting topics rather than one hour and a half about a teen mind-made romantic history. It can talk about want to be another person and what you are now, or the need to have a femenine and a masculine perspective for having much more empathy... Overall, I was very disappointed.",2016

5,"I've very much enjoyed other Kenneth Lonergan films, and I've admired Casey Affleck's acting gifts for a long time. Because of the rave reviews, I was looking forward to seeing this. Unfortunately, the film went into production with a half-baked script. It probably needed another 5-6 rewrites to make the characterization more layered, develop the subplots more, and get to the pith of the central conflict, which was extremely weak.",2016

Set in the picturesque city of Manchester on Massachusetts' north shore, cinematographer Jody Lee Lipes (""Martha Marcy May Marlene"") captures the rugged beauty of the New England town with its bays filled with trawlers and its winter streets and municipal buildings covered in a shimmering white. It is a town that looks as if it has not changed in decades, or even centuries.",2016

5,"I'm not a snob out to distinguish himself from the 97% Rotten Tomato ravers. I was just really disappointed walking out of the theatre. I don't know if I've ever seen a more self indulgent domestic weepy. The film sets the viewer up with mountains of spoon-fed plot tragedy and setback and then mines every last drop of melodrama and tears out of such. Affleck's character is a flawless, blameless Everyman and behaves so heroic it becomes impossible to feel for his plight. Williams is terrific but barely on screen for ten minutes. What apparently is intended to pass as compelling real-life dialog quickly becomes mundane and boring. Likewise, our younger protagonist is a teenage lothario having far too good a time to be awarded compassion. The non- Hollywood ending comes across as pretentious, though it certainly comes as a relief.",2016
10,"Wow! I'd heard all about the Oscar hype surrounding this film but to be honest, while I thought I would be seeing a solid and well-made indie film, I went into it without great expectations of having an 'enjoyable' time: the trailer had ""angst"" written all over it.

1,I joined IMDb today so I could write this review.,2017
1,"Perhaps one of the worst films to start the year off with; the film began simply enough, with a few flash backs and a few references to general guiding story lines of the movie, but then it all went downhill from there. In this film, there is not really a climax, nor really any kind of action/plot at all. It is basically Affleck avoiding his past when he has to go and take care of his brother's kid, who is just another awkward twist to the movie. The kid is an egomaniac, who has two girlfriends, is a general jacka** to everyone, and is generally obnoxious during the whole movie. The part that really got me, and several other people who left the movie before it ended (I stayed hoping it was going to get better) was the extremely awkward scenes, or the awkward persona of Casey Affleck. There would be minutes of just sitting around, which became common enough that about 40% of the film is just awkward conversation or awkward encounters, which is probably why such a film with no actual substance lasted a horrifying 2 hours long. And then to top it all off, the Bostonian ethnicity shared by everyone in the movie made every conversation appear like an argument, with great amounts of language, which although trying to accurately portray the regional people, became more of an ear sore for those who can have conversations without abysmal amounts of language.",2017
1,"Besides the rants of so called Hollywood ""stars"" like Madonna,Ashley Judd, Cher,Whoopie Goldberg,Manchester By The Sea has confirmed my belief that Hollywood movies have reached the lowest denominator in years. I expected a great movie considering all the acclaim by reviewers.It is a boring,unimaginative,slow moving,depressing,film that a middle or high school student could do for a class project to show how not to make a movie. Casey Affleck is a terrible actor.Most of the time he stares into space with little dialogue.And suddenly he's smashing someone in the face.There's no depth to this script and no character development either. I kept yawning about to doze off and looking at my watch. The cinematography is good but if I wanted a travelogue about the Boston & surrounding towns in winter,this would be appropriate for that alone. The baroque music just added to the depressing qualities in this film. It never lets up.There are no redeeming features for this film. It should be tossed in the garbage heap never to be heard from again.Please ,don't waste your money & if curious watch it at home on Netflix.",2017

2,"My husband & I just watched this movie and I cannot believe how bad this is. Characters are so unlikeable, the score is distracting and awful, story is terrible. I was so disappointed since this is an Oscar nominated movie for the film and for the actors. The acting was not good. A total waste of time and not entertaining at all. The only promising thing I can say about the movie is the scenery. The town is right next to the ocean and is really pretty. The only likable character is the brother who dies at the beginning. I usually don't take the time to review a movie but this one is so bad, I just had to put my thoughts on this site.",2017
1,Caution: Contains Spoiler,2017
1,"As I always make an annual ritual of watching the Oscar contenders last night I gave 'Manchester' a viewing. What can one say? My wife and I sat through XXX minutes (whatever it was it seemed an eternity) of one of the most excruciatingly depressing movies I can remember. The narrative made no attempt to redeem itself with any 'feel good' content - it was a movie to slit you wrists to! Our lead character played by Casey Affleck spends the entire movie in an unsuccessful attempt at redeeming himself for having been negligently responsible for the deaths of his three children in a house fire and that is as good as it gets! The director annoyingly kept inter-mingling past and present to such a degree that you were trying to spot things to establish some kind of time line. There was an early scene where our main man tries to grab an officer's weapon to kill himself at the police station. Boy, don't you wish he had succeeded!",2017
1,"If you want to see Casey Affleck stare silently for two hours, this movie is for you--if not, then go see Rogue One. This is a slow moving, terrible movie. I don't see how it ever got produced. The dialog is thin and would never fly in a novel. The editors would reject it immediately. I can't believe it's been nominated for anything. It's a snooze. Lots of long scenes with no dialog...at first I thought the camera had frozen. It starts slow, has no real middle part, and a bad ending. This movie should never have been made. If you take out all the silence and staring, you'd have a 30 minute movie at most. ",2016
3,"""Manchester-By-The-Sea""...don't bother...wait for twenty years until it comes out on an old time movie channel at around 2 am and you need something to put you to sleep. The script is bad. The direction is bad. The make-up is bad. The sets are bad. The costumes are fine, because they are everyday clothes of working class people in the Northeast (Boston and other areas). I found Casey Affleck's performance to be the only redeeming quality in this overrated piece of digital media. He (Affleck) portrays a brooding, jack-ass, violent, bully of an alcoholic very accurately...almost as if he were one or was a another victim of the Hollywood hamburger machine(I applaud him..not standing ""O,"" but polite applause because everything else in the movie was BORING). About that corpse (yes, there's a corpse in one scene): Not a corpse. Not a dead human look-a-like...but a live person trying to pull it off. It doesn't work. How was this evident? The cheeks and face were still naturally pink and flesh tone. There was a popping vein near the temple area. Really? Did you studio execs really think no one who would see this ""movie"" would have seen a real corpse? Come on. If you have seen dysfunctional, violent alcoholics who attack people in bars who they think are staring at them, or are smaller than the drunk, and families who have a hard time handling ""life,"" in real life, you have seen this movie. Three stars because of Affleck's performance. Zero for the movie as a whole.",2017
9,"In spite of a most annoying & pretentious score, this was a very moving film--actually a mouth-gaping appreciation of Casey Affleck. He carries the film, along with the actor playing his brother, Michelle Williams, & his nephew. Some scenes early on seem to plod on, and the pivotal scene of Affleck's past (that will forever haunt him) is reconstructed by voice-over rather than __seeing__ the evidence, which becomes a little disconcerting, considering how important it is. I was really impressed by Affleck's character, who seemed incapable of enjoying anything in his life. His alcoholism is palpable, as well as his violence, but he plays a wholly realized character--infinitely better than he did in ""Gone Baby Gone."" I hope he wins an Oscar for this role: I've never seen him better. And Michelle Williams is wonderful, especially in a near-conclusion confrontation with Affleck: that alone is Oscar-worthy. It's beautifully shot in the actual Manchester-by-the-Sea, and it's definitely worth seeing.",2017

When Lee arrives, Joe has just died and Lee makes arrangements for the funeral with George. Then he seeks out his sixteen year-old nephew Patrick (Lucas Hedges) at the hockey training to tell the news. They go to the morgue and then they head to Joe's lawyer to learn his will. Lee is surprised that Joe has assigned him to be Patrick's guardian. He is reluctant and neither wants to stay in Manchester nor deliver his nephew to his alcoholic mother Elise (Gretchen Mol) and decides to bring Patrick with him to Quincy. However the teenager does not want to leave his life in the town.

6,"This movie started like any other drama, the main character has a problem, where the story of the film has a beginning, the main character and history suffer a turn and in the end of the second act, and them is the end of the story (third act of the movie itself). In other words, like any other drama, this film follows the already very used old paradigm of Syd Field for scripts. A story told a thousand times before, the same way a thousand times, only the characters change and nothing else. The same situations, the same problems.",2017

5,"Marc Forster has delivered some decent big budget films in the past, like World War Z and Quantum of Solace, but All I See is You is smaller and a less epic offering. The story is an interesting one, a woman who has been blind for a long time has a procedure to get her eyesight back. The recovery period is long but ultimately successful in helping her gain her eyesight back, but she slowly starts realizing her life is not at all what it seems. ",2017
6,"What could have been a moral fable supportive of every man and woman engaged in living together turned out to be yet another man-hating movie preaching that women better be girls that fend for themselves.
torment, selfishness and cruelty, is what the plot is drawn out of, a somewhat dark an pitiful perspective on life.
To achieve this, the scenarist needed to carve the male protagonist in the posture of a person that fails to enjoy life, a loser, possessive, reluctant and introvert.
For the first hour you will be introduced to the life of a couple, regularly through the blurry lenses of the female protagonist. The slow pacing of the movie is not a problem there:
before the story even begins, we are given a few clues about some discrete forces in society that tear couples apart: bragging and lust, obsessions and anxiety.
Gina is a blind woman who lives her intimacy in a very solitary yet colorful way. Closed off from sight, every senses place her alone in her environment.
Vulnerable, yet protected and lively, she channels this liveliness into her fantasies and re-immerses herself in her environment through imagination.
As Gina is getting her reparative surgery, we can begin to spot other values that will be driving the plot: disappointment, disillusions, growing expectations, but more than anything: a woman's ascension to power.,
Just as teenage girls grow into womanhood by discovering the power of seduction that they been granted by this society's values, Gina will be living a renewed teenage-hood, in one of those unbalanced ways.
The makeshift inability of her partner to follow in all this excitement can only be explained in one way:
the choice was made to promote extroversion and stigmatize introversion, to promote promiscuity and stigmatize sobriety.
the most unreliable male characters are glorified as consumption products which Gina will follow in avidly.
in contrast, what would be her most reliable partner becomes a distrustful, manipulative and admonished dummy she systematically leaves behind in order to satisfy her desires by herself.
This could have been a remarkable baseline for illustrating how the individual commonly fails to care about the couple,
how people fail at sincerity and intimacy, how they fail at promotion and renunciation, how they focus on profit and aesthetics and forget to build anything deep.
Unfortunately you're about an hour in to the movie, and it is all downhill from there.",2018
5,"Time to tell you how bad this film is. I didn't know much about it but I really like Blake Lively. Ever since the Gossip Girl days I've been interested in seeing more of her. The Shallows might be ridiculous at times but she's good in it and does show effort to her role. The same can be said for her commitment to this film, however its a shame everything else about this film lets her down. Its definitely a ""what the hell did I just watch"" film.",2017
3,"This Movie sounded like it would be something new and interesting, if they would use the theme they wanted to set!
This Movie is more like a riddle because nothing is really clear about anything...
It doesnt really want to go anywhere and just keeps on going for 1:40 hours! Im even sorry for my self that i sat through this!
The recovery process is better made than in most movies to see what she sees on the eye that is recovering!
but the story goes only towards recovering and than stops becoming any kind of story and you need to puzzle through what is happening!
It felt more like a Childbook with no interesst in character or story, it feels just thrown togeher and in the end it doesnt even matter!",2018
5,"I only came to the knowledge of this film's existence by browsing through Blake Lively's IMDB page, and was frankly shocked to see the unbelievably low number of votes (in the 600s at this time). Even more so, I was flabbergasted when I saw that this film carries a production budget of $30M and only managed less than $1M in its limited theatrical run. Usually these numbers indicate a huge bomb caused by universal dislike from the critics and the general audience, but judging by the ridiculously small amount of votes here, the complete lack of exposure of any kind it indicates, and the mediocre scores, this is also not the case. Curious, I watched this film, and now I think I can see why.",2018

His latest falls short of those, but thanks to Blake Lively and some creative visuals, we remain interested enough.",2017

But then, wonderful news! The eye car clinic tells her they can restore sight to her right eye. After the operation, Gina indeed gains eyesight.

All I See Is You will get a proper release date on March 15, 2018 here but i chose to see the film sooner than that and to be honest? It was a waste of time and talent. The whole blind thing goes nowhere and when the film shows some scenes of how she ""sees"" people i could see certain figures popping out here and there so she wasn't 100% blind, also there's some sub plot with her cheating on her husband and some sex scenes and orgies that are thrown away with no real explanation and as a whole the film is boring and painful to sit threw and not even Jason Clarke's and Blake Lively's talents could have saved this film from being another generic Festival film.

2,"I feel like this had the potential to be a great thriller, but there's so many things that went wrong so sadly I can't say it is. The main problem is the pacing, there's just no build up of suspense for the majority of the movie, and so the final sequence of events happen so quickly so as to almost feel rushed. Also whereas the husband is clearly meant to be the antagonist in the story, and the wife is the heroine, there's just something that doesn't quite sit right with me about her, and I feel like both characters come off as quite unlikeable by the end. I mean I know it was really bad for him to change the eye drops, so sure I can accept him as the bad guy, he got it coming to him in the end. But as for the wife let's just put it this way, when she gets her vision back she becomes quite rude towards her husband, self centred, sleeps with another guy, then lies about it and even has a baby which she clearly tries to pass off as the husband's, and then pretends that she's still blind when she can actually see, and by the end after he kills himself and she has the baby it's like it was supposedly a good turn of events, like a sort of redemption. There's a feminist quality to the protagonist, and by regaining her sight it distills this power within her, and that by challenging her newfound self empowerment the husband became the villain. The funny thing is that I felt more sympathy for the husband for the most of the movie... hell maybe that's just me, but I wouldn't be surprised if the majority of people who like this movie are women, but either way it's just bad.",2018

They do things to one another that shows distrust and insecurity. See it for Lively.",2018
9,"I binge watched all 8 episodes, and am now reviewing them more slowly. Another reviewer stated that this series is slow and boring ... well, not to me. This show gives a lot of interesting insight into questions like what is madness, what is sanity, what happens to the psychology of people when they are trapped in impossible circumstances of all kinds, when are emotions helpful when are they harmful? There is a lot more I am thinking about, but I do not want to accidentally want to include a spoiler. I could see a second season but it stands alone well too. The psychology of the ""parents"" and the ""adults"" is as interesting as any other part of the story. They show different kinds of traps, differing ways of being a prisoner and differing ways of breaking free.There is a lot of psychology and philosophy being explored in this series. Lots of referential material to quite a few cultures. The many subtexts are every bit as intriguing as the main text.",2017
5,"This show has some major positives including great casting, good cinematography, and moving scoring. All of these things contribute to the pulling at your emotions, which I suspect is why this show received such a high rating on this site. ",2016
5,"Clearly a lot was invested in the show. Not only is Brit Marling the producer, her acting is perfectly adequate and consistent throughout the 8 hour-long episodes. Yes it is binge-inducing, but only for the wrong reasons. At some point mid-season you're only continuing because you really just want to know what the hell she STILL won't reveal. She takes her sweet time stringing it out, alluding, dragging on about all the otherworldly shizazzle. ",2016
9,"The OA is a delightfully odd TV series -- a show that is built for binge-watching. No, it's not at all like Netflix' Stranger Things, and comparisons shouldn't be made. Actually, The OA is a series that's more akin to Sense 8 -- although that's not a fair comparison either.",2016
10,"This show may not be for everyone, however if you're intrigued by deep, energy filled, powerful works of art then I couldn't recommend this more. Sure, on the surface people can nit pick about minute, and overall insignificant details, perhaps in regards to the acting (which I find to be impeccable) or the pace (which is a very superficial observation). If ones analyzing those things then they're missing the point. Anyone seeking a show with true depth, this is for you. This show is one of those masterpieces that brings out something deep in you that makes you change your ways of thinking. This is not a show to simply pay half attention to, or to have on for background noise. This show demands all of you, it will pull you into its vortex. If you enjoy cinema that can truly move you to your core, like Into the Void, Inception, or even Requiem for a dream; really shake your perception of reality, then please give this a chance. It provides such a cold whimsical poetic darkness to your soul. This is a true work of art.",2016

The plot is something you don't want to know more than what's written above. The cinematography was well done with a few major actors playing some of the roles. I can tell you I am still chewing on the ending, because ,, yes it's one of those that must sink in and mull around a bit. Worth the watch, I couldn't go to sleep till I finished it, it was engrossing. Some nudity, and cursing, drug references but nothing major so maybe tv14 even though it got an MA rating. Well worth your time! Again the ending is very interesting to say the least. At first I wanted to be ticked off then it sinks in and haunts you. Enjoy.",2016
1,"I was really excited about this series to begin with. Both intrigued and fascinated. The plot had me gripped and i couldn't wait to see what happened next. Buy episode 5 I'd lost the will to live. I was both bored, irritated and quite frankly frustrated. You're really telling me that 5 young strong individuals couldn't over power 1 man over 3 years. Sod that. I went on Wikipedia half way through episode 5 to see how it all ended so that the last 5 hours of my life weren't spent in vain! Do yourselves a favour and swerve this one. The whole thing is seriously pointless. And in the end nothing happens. You don't find out what happened to the ""others"" so you end up even more frustrated than in the beginning. Trust me don't bother!!! Utter waste of time!",2017

I was moved by the story line and the acting was really good. Nothing really went as you would expect, which is refreshing to me. The final scene had me in tears. My partner was just glad it was over. I think this series should be rated on the psychological writing. The bonds and pacts made were tremendous! For me this was magical, and breath taking. Even tho I'm not quite a big fan of the supernatural stuff. The end was a bit confusing, but I think it was the right way to take it. Otherwise it would be another obvious plot!",2017

A troll of a series grabbing from many genres without a core. At the end I absolutely do not care if she was delusional, inter-spatial, or an angel; the last scene was just ridicules and exploitative. That last scene was like the click on a mousetrap where most viewers should be hit in the face with the utter realization that the story never had a purpose or a meaning other than ""Stay tuned for Season 2!"".

While watching the last 5-6min of this show I was simply amazed by the stupidity of the ending. I can't describe to you just how cheap and utterly dump the ending is. It's almost worth watching the entire show, just to be able to understand how bad the ending is. I'm amazed, truly. Do you know that feeling you get when you see something so dump and surreal that the only thing you can do is just laugh? To anyone that doesn't know what I'm talking about, watching this will show and explain it to you better then I could ever explain it in words. So, to the effect; Finishing this show leaves me with a epiphany. I need to stop wasting my time watching TV shows! There is nothing to gain from it, and this show is the perfect example. First it tries to show you the importance of friends, family and having insight into yourself, and then it ends in a way that leaves you questioning if the people who made it even know how to feed themselves. How are you supposed to take anything that is messaged throughout the show seriously if in the back of your head you are questioning the utter stupidity of those who made it? Herein lies the genius of the show; it will make you question pretty much every detail in your life that led you to watching this piece of garbage. Well produced, well acted garbage that will for sure take you on a exciting journey, but when the journey is over it will still only be garbage.",2016

2,This show starts at a 9/10 and goes down by one notch per episode. ,2017
1,"It's definitely worth a watch if you want a really good laugh at the end, but the show really drags. i don't understand how the five people she enlists believe her almost without question. I also don't understand why the front doors should be left open, there was no actual explanation for that. She says something about them letting her in but although she's the original angel there's no outerworldly activity that would require the doors to be open. What would have been a great twist is if on the final day she robbed them all, and her and homer used the money to go start a new life together. Instead she just teaches five vulnerable people how to dance, and somehow they use their new dance skills to surprise a school shooter, an event which seemed thought about at the last minute when they realised they weren't sure how to wrap up the season.",2017

1,"It's not that i don't like weird story lines, but i do like them to make a point, not just being weird for weirdness sake. This terrible mess of a story has got holes in it the size of Grand Canyon. Don't read further if you think of watching it, or rather read on and save yourself some time and frustration. A young girl who has been missing for 7 years suddenly turns up on a bridge and jumps down. She is recognized by an elderly couple as their missing daughter. After returning home she gathers 5 people, (a high school bully/drug dealer, a trans gender boy, a stoned teenager, a teacher and a top grade student), and tells them a story. She makes a point of telling them to leave their front doors open to let her in, which makes no sense since she doesn't come to them, they come to her. But back to her story. It seems she was born in Russia. Her father was a rich oligarch and as a little girl she had nightmares about drowning which made her nose bleed. One day she actually drowns but comes back to life and now she's blind. Her father sends her to America to live with an aunt who sells her to the old couple. One day several years later she goes to the statue of liberty where she expects to meet her father. He doesn't turn up which makes her go to a metro station and play the violin. A doctor hears her play and deducts on the spot that she must have had a near dead experience. He then kidnaps her and locks her up in a cellar with 4 other NDEs. He then proceeds to kill them again and bring them back to life, but in the limbo they go to they learn to do some tai chi/yoga stuff that allegedly can cure cancer and wake the dead. Oh, by the way she gets her sight back after being hit on the head while trying to escape. After 7 years the doctor for some reason lets her go and now she teaches her chosen 5 the yoga stuff and a good thing too, because when a school shooter comes out of nowhere they do their thing and prevents a massacre. And that's it. Somebody must have smoked some really good stuff to dream up this nonsense. I wish i had some of that.",2016
2,"I would consider myself someone who has an open mind about art and creative film but this series is not getting a second chance from me.

8,"I have to admit that I had low expectations when I was going to see this movie. The negative reviews are why. Appearance that the film has gone bad, not earned enough, etc. But it does not make sense to listen to others. The best part is to find out yourself. And I have to admit that I enjoyed this movie well, even though I understand some of the criticisms. At the same time, I know that Morten Tyldum is an incredibly good director. One of the best Norwegian directors, without a doubt. I think it's strange that he made something directly bad. The film is not a featured sci fi movie, even if the action takes place on a spaceship. I enjoyed the movie for three reasons: 1) The story is unique, and something I've never seen before. It's always a good sign. 2) It's beautiful to watch, great movie, spectacular setups and scenes. It was impressive and 3) This movie works to switch between a love story and some action sequences. It seems like a thoughtful movie, and I appreciated the thought behind scenes and action. The few people we meet in the film give insight and one becomes familiar with the characters. It is also a strength, but perhaps also a weakness. The gallery is limited. But anyway, I recommend this and hope to see similar movies in the future.",2017
9,"Professional film critics are stupid. That is the conclusion you must reach after watching this movie. I was not expecting much after reading the uniformly negative critical reviews.

And the acting is so eminent that you are there yourself trying to decide what you would do if you awoke on a fully autonomous spaceship trying to figure out what is going on.",2016
10,"I'm almost convinced film critics are paid off...I thoroughly enjoyed this movie more than most of the ""critically acclaimed"" films I've watched this year. This movie had everything- love, drama, philosophical/existential questions, and incredibly suspenseful moments (and not just action scenes!!). The acting was great, pacing was good (never was bored), and the visuals were amazing as well. Also the trailer didn't spoil the movie at all, which was nice. My only gripe would be about the ending, which was still fine.",2016
9,"The movie is definitely worth your time. Firstly, 10/10 for realism. I would absolutely have done all those things if I were in their shoes. Secondly, the acting is one of the best I've seen (I was pretty skeptical about J.Lawrence but not anymore after this movie; and Chris Pratt's acting keeps getting better and better since GotG). The plot is quite unique (I do not believe I've ever seen another plot that resemble this). Lastly, the visuals is BREATHTAKING (I absolutely adore the ship design).",2016

8,"Passengers is yet another example as to why you should go see the movies professional critics hate & save your money on the ones they absolutely love. Going to see a movie at the theater is like $30 now for just 2 people & that's without visiting concessions. I don't know about everybody else but if I'm going to spend a few days worth of grocery money for a 2 hour movie experience I'm really hoping not to be bored to tears or looking at the time wondering how much longer it'll be until a movie is over. Passengers just ends up on my very long list, lately, of movies critics tried to bring down that were waves better than the ones they are directing people to see. This movie is visually stunning & the story telling is not only thought provoking but innovative while doing so! It was great to see a story like this one told in a way that didn't spend most of its time trying to dialogue it's way into Oscar nominations. If you are going to venture out to see a movie for the Holidays go see this one!",2016

I think critics are giving it bad reviews because it didn't have the best dialogue, so don't go if you're just looking for something negative in a movie. If you're emotional, I think this would be a good movie to watch during that time. It's beautiful, well done, heartbreaking in some moments, and has amazing actors. It's comedic and romantic, with some intense parts so it has a lot of complements and genres in it. This isn't a negative thing at all, this movie just has it all.

5,"The first half is incredibly boring. Nothing happens for half of the movie. I understand that we need to ""feel"" the loneliness. But there are so many good movies that portrayed the Robinson experience without being also boring. And then: completely unrealistic on each level, on each detail (maybe apart from the love story, which is cute and romantic). This is not supposed to be fantasy or adventure. It is supposed to be a pure-blood SF story, whose main character is a mechanical engineer. So I expect that at least most of the technical details should hold a little water, as well as the main story line. But no: every little technical/scientific/engineering detail is completely illogical, and the methods deployed by the main character to solve the situations are absurd. Look: my motorbike has, I believe, around 5 completely different methods to stop the engine in case of emergency (cut the contact, cut the electricity, cut the gas, put it into neutral etc); but a huge stellar ship has: NONE ? A huge stellar ship the size of a village (5270 inhabitants) has only 1 (one) bed in the infirmary ? No sensor detects for 2 years that there is an open hole in the hull of the ship, and loss of pressure in some rooms ?! There is no backup system for anything ‚Äì instead they repeat ""this system is supposed to be impossible to break, so this cannot happen"" ‚Äì gosh I don't remember any engineering 101 lesson to ever say this line, they all speak of redundancy, backup, fail-safe and fail-over mechanisms. The individual space costume resists the heat of a reactor that would otherwise break the hull of the whole spaceship ?! There is absolutely no method to alert the large sleeping crew of a huge ship that something went wrong ?! There is no alarm system on a huge space ship ? My car has a better information collecting system from various sensors than that space ship, you actually DON'T need to plug-in floppy-disks around your car to collect data, they kind of get collected automatically and displayed on the screen. And if something stops, you still have the history of what happened before, stored in some central memory chip. Airplanes today have 2 independent black boxes to store everything that happens on board, all information from all sensors, any sound etc; for a space ship they just forget about this. For a space ship I would actually add maybe 3 or 5 different independent backup storage devices, plus maybe 2 or 3 backup computing devices, stored in completely different physical locations, completely independent, each one able to resume operation automatically and instantly if another one fails and maybe other 1 or 2 of them manually. Also: an intelligent passenger decides to solve a complex problem himself alone, instead of waking up like the whole 250 engineering crew of the ship. OK, we all expect a couple of goofs in any standard reasonable SF movie, it is difficult to keep track of all details and even good movies miss things. But when you hear a stupid idea every couple of minutes for the entire half of the movie when something actually happens, then the movie is crap. Good pictures though, loved the graphical effects. And the final completely weird finale to put the cherry on top: what is one young loving beautiful heterosexual couple expected to do alone, their entire lifetime, on a spaceship with 5000 vacant seats available ?... I would have said ""children"". Well, guess what: they decided to just plant a lot of trees.",2017
5,"I had really great expectations for this movie, and maybe that's the reason why I was so disappointed. Of course, all the actors are great, and even though the direction is not bad, it's really a typical love movie scenario, with the doubt at the beginning, the intense love, the betrayal, and finally the traditional happy ending. That could've been good without all the inconsistencies there are. For example, why didn't they thought to resurrect the captain, just as Aurora did for Jim? And there was enough place for both of them in the end. It would be Titanic all over again if Rose had decided to stay in the water with Jack. Not a bad movie, some ideas are great : leaving a man alone with his thoughts and robots to see his attitude evolve is interesting, the fact that he sacrificed a life instead of staying alone too, but those ideas could've been pushed so much further if they did not decided to focus on their love story. Honorable mention to Arthur, the best character in my opinion.",2017

Gradually as the film goes on they start falling for each other and by this point, it does start to feel like Titanic in space. ",2017
5,"My initial thoughts after first seeing the trailer for Passengers was that it was a gross excuse to put Hollywood's two hottest actors on screen together. I saw that the critics had given this abysmal reviews and I wasn't surprised. I was however surprised to see that user reviews contradicted what critics had to say. Reviews contained descriptors like unexpected, great acting, suspense and the like. Well let me tell you this film was none of those. Passengers was forgettable. It wasn't bad, it wasn't good, it just was. Like I said, nothing more than an excuse to have studly guy and sexy girl on screen and cash some cheques while they were at it. The visuals were meh, the acting was passable, the script was something a fourth grader could have written. I feel like I've seen this movie 100 times in some different form. I'm only writing this to detract from the other user reviews that say to ignore what the critics are saying. Though it's not terrible it DEFINITELY isn't worth going out to see.",2017
4,"In all science fiction, suspension of disbelief is required to become engaged in the story. However, what the writers of Passengers fail to realize is that suspension of disbelief applies to technology, not human stupidity. The audience can overlook warp drive, ray guns, transporters, etc., but what can't be overlooked is a total lack of common sense in using this technology. There were many opportunities for interesting story lines, but Passengers attempts to patch plot holes that don't work instead of exploring concepts that do.",2017
10,Spoilers!,2016
1,"With all those spaceship analogies along the movie, it's impossible not to relate those two romantic stereotypical movies! Except Titanic didn't got the ending so wrong. Passengers begins as a fine movie, and derails real quickly when Chris Pratt discovers how he can wake someone up. Right then and there I couldn't understand why, for the love of what's sacred, wouldn't he wake up someone who could actually help him solve his issue. He had access to everyone files, I'm sure he could figure something out. Oh no, of course the obvious choice is to chose a female, stalk her, and wake her up without she being able to give him consent. What a lame excuse to try and explain it by saying ""a man drowning will try to drag someone down with him. It's not pretty but the man was drowning"". Seriously, Morpheus? Give me a break!",2017

The subtle way they teach their kids to be decent human beings is so important right now! I am very picky about sitcoms and I usually pick the ones that will succeed from the beginning. This show has a great cast and great writers. I hope they just continue to grow together and not screw things up like ""Two Broke Girls"" and ""The Big Bang"" because they are no longer watchable !! Please continue to make this better and better--regular TV needs you!!!",2017
9,"I had some doubts after the pilot but with some revisions I can see 'Man With A Plan' evolving. To see the return of Matt LeBlanc in this role as family man taking over as ""Parent Captain"" is quite amusing and casting Liza Snyder as Andy absolutely compliments his performance in this show. The role of teacher, Mrs Rodriguez cast with Diana Maria Riva is priceless. I love to watch her spar with LeBlanc as he fills in for the missus as room parent in daughter Emmy's kindergarten class. The chemistry & banter between Matt LeBlanc & Liza Snyder (so happy to see her return as well) is quite natural & witty compared to 'Kevin Can Wait' which is beyond painful to watch. The kids in the cast Grace Kaufman, Mathew McCann and Hala Finley are quite cute & very precocious with their repartee. Having Kevin Nealon as Adam's brother Don Burns is an added bonus! Only drawback I agree in an earlier comment regarding 'Man With A Plan' is the canned laughter. Otherwise a great show that has flourished wonderfully episode by episode, just keep 'the plans' coming..‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ",2017
7,"Just started watching this new ""CBS"" sitcom called ""Man with a Plan"" and so far it's funny and it explores the ins and outs of married life with kids as the woman and man each take on different roles. Starring one of my favorite actors Matt LeBlanc(from ""Friends"" and ""Episodes"" fame)as Adam Burns a man's who's decided to stay at home and raise his kids even though he's got his own contractor supply business on the side, and it's the Mrs. Burns(Liza Snyder)who has went back to work in the medical field. And yes as expected this brings some growing pains in the form of dealing with the kids and then both Adam and Andi have their own marriage problems. It's a typical sitcom with good one liners and funny stories as it mixes today's culture with family life, so take my advice and give ""Man with a Plan"" a watch.",2016

I have watched Friends , Joey and Episodes and he was great in Episodes. he is really good here but he is not enough. the wife isn't very funny or likable and there isn't much chemistry between her and Matt. too bad it didn't work out with Jenna Fischer. It would have been great. So when Matt is on the screen It's good and you would laugh and get entertained. The kids are fine and I wish to get more of them and less than the wife. The writing could be much better and there is room for improvement. so the show has potential. something else is it was obvious in the pilot that it was re-shot and they are trying to hide it. it makes you lose interest.

Andi has a loving husband named Adam Burns (Matt LeBlanc) who owns his own construction contracting business and because he loves his wife and kids he agrees to help out a lot more with the raising of his children so that Andi can go back to work and not have to run their household all by herself. This is a simple enough plot and the three kids appear to be quite normal healthy children. ",2016

The premise is strong about a three kid family whose mom follows her husband's agreed on on long term plan to now return to work without thinking of the consequences. There is much current theme in it not that well worked in the failing to come completely together in the first episode yet together by the second. The first episode of Matt's wife not explaining what he has to do to take the kids to school and Matt not explaining to his brother how to cover for him in their business from which he now skips as stay at home dad had enough substance and quality for me to last it out, the second really goo,.

8,Thanks for FINALLY giving us a funny show. Really laughing my ass of at some of the jokes and things that happen. Show is funnier than some of the other reviewers will let you believe. Reviewers saying Matt LeBlanc should do another show are not reviewing this show. I think he is perfect in his role. The show is about someone who does not really want to take up the responsibility of being a father but needs to. Matt is doing the role fine! His timing in the show is outstanding and he makes the correct faces at the right times.,2017
9,"Finally a good comedy show! Enough with the trying-to-be-funny shows with the silly and annoying characters! I haven't seen anything really that Matt LeBlanc did after Friends so i was hesitant at first because i thought he was going to copy the ""Joey"" character. But no, not at all! In this show he is a smart family man and he is totally pulling it off! I believe the show is one of the funniest I've seen for a long time and believe me I've seen a lot ! The casting is great(i love Liza), the acting and the scripts are good and that is all i want. It is great to see LeBlanc maturing and acting as a loving husband rather than a womanizer. I loved the show from the first episode, i think is great. Exactly what you need after a long stressful day to relax. Hope it's coming back for more seasons!! Keep up the good work !!",2017
7,"I don't know how long this will last because, let's be honest, Man with a Plan does not rely on an very ""Original"" argument and some situations you have already seen on other shows. But, what it lacks there, I think it compensates with Joey, eh, Matt LeBlanc. He's still funny as hell, he can deliver the jokes and, I believe if you give it time, the show can grow on it. OF course, the pilot it's an indicator of where the writers intend to take the show to, and like I said, it's not something original, I just hope they can navigate through the story. Matt takes on the role of the dad left in charge of the kids, the kids are obviously spoiled and by the end of the first episode everything seems to work OK. But as always, things should get complicated from now on, and if the writers are smart, that's where the show can get it's edge to make it count.

Kevin Nealon is the perfect side-kick, he is certainly toned back quite a bit from Weeds (character), to fit more of a family type show. But his is always entertaining, and he helps make the show something far beyond ordinary. The children are very good actor's and Don's (Kevin Nealon) wife is also very good. Most of all the show isn't predictable like many sitcoms. They actual have show's about school & parenting and make it entertaining at an adult level. By episode 10 the show had hit it stride and kinda ran away from the pack of other show's to separate itself as something special in my mind. Writing is very good, and it excelled, getting better & better. Id give it a perfect score, based on some of the mediocre stuff i seen.",2018

Honestly, it's in the same boat as the comedy, ""Kevin Can Wait."" It has a well known lead but nothing else really going for it. It has a weak surrounding cast and bad, generic writing. Of course the god awful, canned laughter just needs to go away. This show most likely will be canceled within a year. It honestly offers nothing new to the table whatsoever. They even had to re-cast the female lead for this show which probably won't make much of a difference at this point. Will give it a few tries but keeping expectations low.",2016

Perhaps the network has faith in their sitcom stars like Kevin James and Matt LeBlanc gaining an audience. True, ""Man with a Plan,"" is no ""Friends."" Matt's character is the father and husband in Los Angeles suburbs. He spent the first season dealing as the class parent. Now, the sitcom has added Stacy Keach to play his father and Kevin Nealon to play his brother. The series has moved away from the school to the home and work environment. The show has grown on me with the second season. The first season was quite troubled with weaknesses. The second season seems better and more polished than before. It's not the greatest sitcom on television. Matt LeBlanc has come a long way from his character on Friends. The series still needs to work on character development and story lines but it's better than last year. I was surprised to see it actually return for the sophomore season.",2017

Despite a few flaws, the 1960 version was balanced and entertaining: cast, dialogues and music, notably, have now become legend. In comparison the latest version delivers almost nothing.

Despite Fuqua's most confident directing and Denzel Washington's excellent performance, the film ends up being as cluttered as the cast would suggest. When it all comes down to it, it is a matter of an overload of star power. While there have been films in the past that have had incredible casts and flourished, this film makes it feel as though the film is only big enough for one star. Chris Pratt is great as an alcoholic and incredibly ballsy gunslinger, Faraday, but he lacks any gusto to really command the screen as does most of the cast outside of Denzel Washington (someone who I can't say enough good things about here). It ends up feeling like these roles could have been played by anyone when it should have felt like these actor's owned these roles so much so that you can't imagine anyone else in it. Unfortunately that isn't the case here. Quite frankly, the only performances worth noting are Washington and Peter Sarsgaard, who gives a devilishly good performance as a sadistic law man. In this respect, the film is very much a disappointment for anyone expecting to see the next great ensemble film of the year. More importantly, those of you who were excited to see the re-teaming of the Training Day squad (Washington, Hawke and Fuqua) will have to wait a bit longer for that because there is barely any chemistry between Ethan Hawke's Goodnight Robicheaux and Washington's Chisolm. The screenplay, written by True Detective's Nic Pizzolatto and action aficionado, Richard Wenk is lackluster to say the least. As I said, the character development with the characters is either not there or so forced and unnatural that it takes you out of it. After the abysmal season 2 of True Detective and this, I think is safe to say that Pizzolatto is turning into the one hit wonder that everyone feared that he would be. However, I will still hold off on officially saying that about him because there are some ideas that were introduced in the film that were really interesting which is why it is all the more frustrating when they are cast aside and never touched upon again. The screenplay is the big problem here. It is well paced but emotionally hollow. It never really reaches anywhere near the heights of the Kurosawa masterpiece or even the 1957 remake that that film spawned. In this case, the script reads and sounds like a bad imitation. Despite this, The Magnificent Seven does boasts some pretty exceptional action set pieces much to Fuqua's credit. The film is explosive but it is highly predictable. Those who are killed don't really resonate with the viewer because quite honestly, we don't care about any of the characters outside of Washington. They are mere footnotes to the larger picture which is a monumental disappointment. Overall, I thought that Antoine Fuqua's The Magnificent Seven boasted a great idea and never truly capitalized on it. The film felt like it really could have been something but we are left holding on to the idea of what could have been.",2016

Where is the superlative cast that include Yul Brynner, Eli Wallach, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Coburn, and Vladimir Sokoloff? You might argue that Denzel Washington and Chris Pratt are on a level with Brynner and McQueen, but I wouldn't. Pratt certainly has potential, but he doesn't yet have McQueen's star power. The rest are pale imitations, except perhaps for an unbelievably fat Vincent D'Onofrio who is certainly entertaining.",2016

3,"Hollywood, you do not take a classic film and do a lackluster job and make it worst. You try to transcend. It's lazy Hollywood all over again. The script makes no attempt to develop any of the characters and what we get is a piece of hollow action flick with no substance to it. Hollywood thinks we are all sheep and simply throw away our hard earned money to them. They insult our intelligence over and over again with remakes of great classics promising to be better than the original. Once in a blue moon they succeed but not this time! Don't waste your money. Wait for it to go on DVD or watch it free if you can. Better yet, watch the classic Magnificent 7 with Yul Brynner and you will see how much better that one is to the remake.

Actors who sell there soul for this kind of B grade zombie violence movies, are in despaired need of money or the don't care what they do.

4,There is a huge gun battle so those who are watching for that will be satisfied. Sadly this movie could have been better written. The dialog isn't clever in fact it sounds dumb most of the time. The humor falls flat too. There are some silly plot elements and a draggy middle section.,2016

8,"The Western has long become a rarity on the big screen, replaced over the last few decades as the dominant action genre first by bulging muscles and explosions, then by spandex and superpowers. So this big-budget remake of the 1960 classic comes as a welcome breath of tobacco-filled air, even if it doesn't quite live up to its predecessor. But as a piece of popcorn entertainment, it fires on all cylinders. Not surprisingly with Antoine Fuqua (Training Day, The Equalizer, Shooter) calling the shots, subtlety is pushed aside for frenetic set pieces and belief-defying heroics, especially in the wild climactic showdown that demonstrates minimal CGI does not equal minimal fun. Amongst all the balletic gunplay and macho posturing there's a relatively simple story: town is overrun by a dastardly villain (Peter Sarsgaard oozing creepiness), town employs cowboys-for-hire (guess how many) for protection, town fights with said cowboys leading the way. That the plot requires little more explanation then that highlights the focus of the movie, for better and for worse, however the fact it never feels shallow or superficial can be attributed to the exhilarating action and the ultra-cool cast. And what a fantastic cast it is. Denzel Washington is reliably charismatic as the contemplative leader, Chris Pratt is magnetic as the group's joker, Ethan Hawke is intense as the tormented sniper, Byung-hun Lee is enigmatic as the blade-wielding assassin, Vincent D'Onofrio is intriguing as the philosophical killer and Haley Bennett is fierce as the townswoman who stands her ground. Best of all, the eclectic characters ‚Äì also including Manuel Garcia-Rulfo as the rowdy Mexican and Martin Sensmeier as the Indian warrior ‚Äì share a wonderful chemistry that makes them utterly watchable from start to finish. An energetic remake with style to spare, The Magnificent Seven is a rip-roaring adventure that'll please long-neglected Western fans to no end.",2016
3,"Character development - minimal, at best. I felt no connection with any of the characters. I did not care if they lived or died; in the 1960 version by director John Sturges, I felt some empathy and sadness when characters died; here - nothing. ",2016
3,Where do I begin? As a lifelong Star Trek fan I had an uneasy feeling while watching this movie. I could not shake the sense that I was just looking at another mediocre summer popcorn flick; an experience that would evaporate from my brain just hours after I leave the theater.,2016
5,"Disappointed with this entry in the series. Star Trek to me isn't about motorcycles and loud music, it's more about exploring science fiction concepts and themes through great storytelling (which this film has very little of). The ""twist"" at the end is figured out about a 1/3 of the way in. Lazy storytelling where props are laid for action scenes for no apparent reason (why is there a motorcycle aboard a starship?).",2016

6,"Not a Star trek fan, I'm a sci-fi fan. There's a difference. Loved the first, disappointed with the second, then this. I don't know why early reviews are so positive, but anyway, it's my view. Been so long since a movie of this genre has been the complete package, story, acting, directing, CGI, etc. This movie does nothing to address that. I got bored 2/3 way in, wanting it to end. So many plot holes, just so many. Go see it, but don't have great expectations. It was nice to look at, but that's all. The bad guy started out being very good (at being bad I mean). Opening was OK, nice special effects, just no credibility. And way too much shaky camera, way to much.",2016

8,"Those of us who know and love Star Trek are fully aware of the enormous wealth of its universe (indeed several parallel universes, and even recently this reimagined timeline that is anathema to some, but acceptable to others including myself). The whole comprises tens of films and hundreds of episodes in many series, and even life-imitates-art aspects like comments made by makers and stars at Conventions years later! This all has the paradoxical effect (also very visible with series like the BBC's Dad's Army) that the version we hold in our imaginations is now always likely to be richer and more meaningful and greater than any individual installment - past or present - that we actually get to see. And that is as true of ST ""The Original Series"" as it is of Abrams's new offering ""Beyond"", not least given that many of the Kirk-Spock-Scott-McCoy outings from the 3rd season of the ""Original"" were weak, and only erased as turkeys from our memory by reappearances of the original cast in great films like STIV and STVI.",2016
7,"As crazy as my title sounds, it's actually very apt..., looking back at the original Star Treks, they're starting to look old, for a futuristic show it sure is like stepping back into the past. However, with Star Trek Beyond, the Star Trek universe looks futuristic once again, spectacular action sequences and outlandish locations..., this is the Star Trek we all thought we loved, but it's only now we can actually say we love it.

8,I had very little expectations on this film but I really liked it.,2016

Star Trek Beyond is the third installment in what is being called the ""Kelvin timeline"" of Star Trek with the rebooted universe of Kirk's storyline. Compared to Star Trek 2009 and ""Into Darkness"", this film felt astronomically more like a Star Trek film. I was absolutely blown away; what I thought was going to be a mindless, action-oriented Star Trek movie, was actually a brilliantly written and directed Star Trek film that felt more than fitting in the Star Trek universe.",2016

10,"My review is short and simple. I am both a Star Trek and science fiction fan. I decided to go in on full free fall mode. Despite what the haters were saying; they themselves not even having watched the film yet. I stayed away from that poison. If you're a Trekkie or Trekker, you'll love it. If you're into fantasy, you'll love it. If you just appreciate a good movie, you'll love it. If you're one of those ""fans"" who are never satisfied with reboots in general and think that nothing could ever top your original love, then you'll definitely dig around for something trivial to make you bash it. A true fan who loves the concept, the science fiction of it all, the art, the futuristic sense, the imagination, the escape that Star Trek undoubtedly brings, then you'll appreciate the story. The actors deliver. The character development is on point. The music? Amazing. Go in and watch the movie and accept it for what it is. Don't look for something negative because if you go in with that mentality then you'll find find it. Haters gonna hate. Ainters gonna ain't. Go on. Be an ""ainter"". When you walk out of there realizing that for two hours you had escaped the harshness of the world, a world Gene Roddenberry was so against, you'll thank yourself for allowing it.",2016

8,"Pretty damned impressive! nuff said! it Maybe not! it is pretty damned sad when a fan film is better than the three prequels. The story is good and fits in the ""Star Wars"" universe. I hate when fans whine about how a studio screwed up a franchise and how they could do it better...Only to turn out terrible, amateurish drive;l! Not so here! This director has a future and all of the acting is solid, something devoid in your average fan film. The actor who plays Solo, just doesn't ape Harrison Ford, there is acting and a character going on As a stuntman and stunt coordinator, i have to commend you on the fight scene. Shot sp you can see what is going on, without shaky cam and weasel on acid hyper editing. Bravo, well done",2017
4,"""Han Solo: A Smuggler's Trade"" is a 13-minute live action short film from December 2016 that managed to get pretty popular through Youtube. The title already tells you that it jumps on the recent Star Wars bandwagon and here we have Han Solo out on his quest to save Chewbacca who is held captive by a bad guy. That's all there is to it. The scene early on with the green lady and the firing in the desert feels very random and thrown in with no further connection to the story. Visually, in terms of sets, costumes and effects, it is above-average for a fan film, but the story is really only good enough for half the runtime. This is a bit of a shame as with Doug Jones (playing the bad guy) this one has an actor with a talent and experience that is usually not to be found in short films, especially rookie works because this is the very first credit for writer and director Keith Allen. The Han Solo actor looks the part physically, especially in costume, but his recurring smile is not working. And there are more problems with this movie if you look at it in detail, for example how he shouts at Chewbacca while fighting and the bad guy won't even mind. So yeah, it's a relatively forgettable film and only worth seeing for the very biggest Star Wars fans. Everybody else can skip it and they won't be missing much. I give it a thumbs-down.",2017

9,"There are so many reviews detailing every minor things they thought wad wrong but why can't people just enjoy something without picking faults in things that don't affect the overall show? The acting was very good indeed. the story was good, it flowed nicely, it ended in a way where I cannot wait to watch the episode 2. Ryan Phillipe's depiction of Bob was superb! He was truly believable. It wasn't overbearing with political nonsense, it showed his home life and explained why he had walked away from the army. It has the potential for greatness if the rest of the series keep up the pace, it wasn't one dimensional, it looks like we are really going to get to know the characters, and at the end of the day it was entertaining, what else do you want from a TV show??",2016

9,"There are quite a few bad reviews for this pilot episode of Shooter, and I don't quite realize why. I am a big man of a well made series and also quite picky and critical. Very few series can maintain my interest for a long time, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Dexter, Boardwalk Empire, Hannibal are just a few I have stuck to right to the end. However, as movies are so badly made these days, Star Trek Beyond anyone? I have to admit I enjoyed the pilot. I think Ryan Philippe was fine, he didn't appear too young to be a seasoned vet. I thought the family angle was endearing and added to the torment of what is about to happen to him. I watched the 2007 movie Shooter with Mark Wahlberg and I also think it was a very good movie that deserved a higher rating. Many people have talked about the series of books that movie and this series are based upon. If the series follows the book (I presume), and the movie then we kind of know what to expect from the following episodes, but even then I don't care. It will be interesting to see if they can maintain the suspense and action for 10 or so episodes. Sure, perhaps nine out of ten is too high a rating, but clearly there were haters out there slating this pilot and giving it two or three stars which is just unfair. I am also pleased that clearly right from the start the producers are saying this is just one season and not going to be drawn out and become ridiculous like Prison Break, and personally I have felt the same with Gotham, The Flash and the 100 (although season two was excellent, season three made me leave). So sure we know what to expect from the coming episodes, a lot of running, a lot of conspiracy theories, a lot of Swagger digging for the truth, and I am fine with that, if they keep up the production values and dialogue, and the directing was fine.",2016
1,"This series was obviously written by people with precisely zero knowledge or experience with firearms, shooting, ballistics, etc., and who couldn't be bothered to hire a decent consultant. In the pilot episode we're introduced to Bob Lee Swagger, a wildlife conversationalist and Collectivist. He's supposed to be out hunting and killing dinner for his family. Instead, he's shooting illegal traps and tranquilizing wolves because he just cares...so...much.",2017
7,"A series pilot today is everything. it is like the weekend box office results for a movie. It has to hit. That is the new reality in TV. There are just too many options. That said, hang in there. The pilot was not Mr Robot. That was one of the best pilots ever. ",2016
9,"The show is a lot slower than the movie, but this has its bonuses, such as character development, and having a chance to get to know the players better.The cast all did a fine job, and the slight changes from the movie give it a new feel all of its own.I really think they have set a base where the show can go in many different directions, and a more open story line than the movie. The locations, pacing, and overall production was all on par with a good watchable TV show, and the actors and parts they played work pretty good. So give it a go if you enjoy a good show without all the unreal stuff that other shows throw in..On target for now, and hoping it will keep hitting the mark. season 1 episode 1 review 9/10",2016
5,"Main character is world class sniper. And says "".223 is not powerful enough to kill anything bigger than a squirrel."" Really? Explain that to soldiers who used that caliber in war for decades. (.223 is almost identical to 5.56mm. But the mil variety is different from civilian ammo. You probably don't want to mix them for your shooting pleasure.) ""A bullet kills in 3 ways"" Hmm.. Any bullet? 5mm pellet gun bullet? .50 cal BMG bullet? Bullet velocity at any range? Is there any evidence for a bullet killing by hydro-static shock? Has there ever been a bullet that simply made a tunnel through a body without tumbling or fragmenting and splintering? Hasn't anyone survived a body shot? Or limb shot longer that 15 minutes? Or fragmented wound? As an extreme case, I think Roy Benavidez survived all of that and more, in the same engagement. The .223 comment started this show off with a questionable beginning. So I nit-picked from then on. I so wanted this show to work. But sprinkling data (valid and invalid) does not go with the experience and skill of a world class sniper. I loved the books (not all though), and the character, and the movie. But this series needs (or needed) a better tech adviser. Probably a former sniper or instructor.

Although it is hard to say after the first plot, how it really will end up. Anyhow, I will wait for the next show and see if it is worthy my higher scores. One at last, there are a view top shows out there, meaning top writing, acting, scenery, music, etc. (some like Banshee, although it might be not everybody's genre), anyway, this first show is a little poor on these parts, but as I said it has the potential to become much better.

I really liked the first three episodes, even though they were nothing like the 2008 movie, but by the 4th episode, it started getting really ridiculous. In real life, his wife and everyone associated with him would be watched by all the government agencies for years. His wife and Memphis are no longer watched after the 3rd episode, he goes to the library, to gun shows, to convenience stores (he even meets his wife in the bathroom at one) he sneaks to see his wife and has sex one night, he meets his wife and daughter for a family picnic and spends the afternoon together, nobody is ever following him, his wife or Memphis. By episode 10, there is no hiding, he is out in public with nobody paying any attention to him. Really??? This guy was supposed to have tried to assassinate the President of the United States! Everyone would recognize him. It's really sad that this turns into such a joke. But, I suppose my expectations were a little high. After all, how can you take a 2 hour movie and make 10 episodes each an hour long and never solve the show? Good thing I didn't have anything better to do on a hot, rainy, miserable weekend.

What a disappointment though. It's the classic ""the book ain't good enough, we can certainly do better"", syndrome. So why not write an original story instead of just borrowing character names ? Living in a cabin Deep in the Woods with his dog ? We can't have that. Lets give him a nice house and a Hallmark Family. Oh, and let's turn Nick Memphis into a sexy female FBI agent.

1,"In context, I am a veteran, been a shooter since I was 5 (now 50+), read all of Stephen Hunter's books, and normally ignore even bad technical mistakes. I don't figure this to be read by show watchers, but hope Mr. Hunter and the show management does. I lasted about 3 sentences until the hero self-righteously proclaims the .223 is only good for squirrels. Seriously?! Who reviewed this? They should be fired. The .223 {Remington, sic} is the civilian version of the 5.56 x 45 NATO used by 99.9% of the free world's military to kill other human beings (certainly bigger than a squirrel, and about the same size as a wolf). Down here in Texas it is a popular round to use on wild hogs, and while there is a debate over the ethics of it (it is a bit under powered for a 300+ lb wild boar, IMO) many many many hogs have been killed humanely with one round, again hogs are a bit bigger and tougher than squirrels or even most people. There is not a single sniper anywhere in the world who would find such a statement anything but ridiculous. Mr. Hunter, I hope you b*****d about this, it is a direct reflection on you.",2016
3,"I have read all the Bob Lee Swagger books, and was even a fan of the Shooter movie with Mark Wahlberg. However, this thing to me is awful. I fought to stay awake. I don't see this making it, but hey, who am I?",2016
3,This review is for the producers of this TV show. ,2016
2,Where to begin? ,2017
4,I really like Ryan Phillippe and he can be pretty bad ass as in The Way of the Gun movie but there are just too many things wrong in the Shooter.,2016
6,The first half of season one rocked--the second half flopped.,2016
5,"The first few episodes feel good. Nice music, nice directing, Luke Cage is played by a good actor and a couple of supporting actors are good as well. But from episode to episode it falls into the ridiculous. Cottonmouth has powers in the comics, he's got nothing here... Just another stupid gangster, with an origin story than comes way too late. And then poof, he's dead. Right after the writers put some depth into him. What's the point...",2016
1,"*SPOILERS* Allow the stage to be set. Luke Cage is an incredibly interesting and loved character from Marvel comics lore. Back in the days when few people ran around mask-less, he did so with a bravado unmatched, and in more recent years grew to have a wife, became a father, and even lead his own team of Avengers. He's a business man who doesn't take any back talk. Mike Colter showed us he was clearly the man for the job back in Jessica Jones, encapsulating the style and attitude very very well. And then the writers for this monstrosity got on board.",2016
5,"I was looking forward to this more so than the other Marvel Netflix shows, but Luke Cage is easily the weakest of the bunch. ",2016
4,Started very slow for a marvel series but the setting and most of the cast were promising better episodes.,2016
7,"Luke Cage starts off great with a strong classic noire vibe in a modern coat of paint. A strong cast creates a powerful atmosphere and tone that draws you in. Mike Colter clearly looks the part of an indestructible giant and plays Luke Cage in a somber and traditional ""tormented, silent protagonist"" kind of way, but it is the surrounding cast that truly brings out this jewel: Simone Missick as the honest officer from the street, Mahershala Ali as the tormented gang leader, Frank Whaley as the smart mouth sidekick cop, Alfre Woodard as the congresswoman stuck in both the future and the past, Frankie Faison as the mentor and spot of light in the dark.",2016
4,"So first of, I realized I am just not very into the whole marvel superhero theme anymore after 30 years of reading and watching. They just seem to have too many plot holes and go against my knowledge in natural science. Perhaps its about time to stop watching them.",2016
3,"*SPOILERS* I started Luke Cage with high expectations, as I am sure many people did, because I thought I already knew what to expect. After all, this is not the first time we have seen this character (he also appeared in Jessica Jones). In terms of the main character, Mike Colter brings the same good performance to the character this time around, but where this show falls flat is everyone else. I want to say that the supporting cast kill this show, but that isn't fair to the actors and actresses who play them, because the acting is solid all around in Luke Cage. The problem is the writing. The writing makes this by far the worst of all the Marvel TV shows. This was not immediately clear, and so for the first few episodes I really enjoyed Luke Cage. The music was fantastic, the villain, Cornell ""Cottonmouth"" Stokes, was very charismatic and initially intimidating, and the banter between characters (usually involving ""Pop"") was enjoyable. Then it started to fall apart when it came time for Luke to step up to be a hero. The biggest misstep is one that Marvel consistently has problems with: the villain. ""Cottonmouth"" is quite possibly the dumbest, least powerful (or in any way successful) villain in the entire MCU. In order to raise the stakes, the villain has to pose a threat of some kind to the hero. The best villains match, or even exceed the power of the heroes they face off against. ""Cottonmouth"" is not very powerful and intimidating to begin with, and does nothing as the series goes on but lose more power and control. Wilson Fisk in Daredevil was a fantastic villain because he was not only physically intimidating (even to the point of being able to go toe to toe with Daredevil himself) but he was a master manipulator and strategist. It took everything Daredevil and company had to put him away, and Daredevil only barely pulled it off at that (and not till the last episode of the season). ""Cottonmouth"" on the other hand, is not physically intimidating, and is not only not an intelligent strategist, but he cannot even control his own crew to the point that they kill people that he does not want dead. He repeatedly tries to kill Luke, with absolutely no success, and yet refuses to try anything else. There is even a scene where his cousin (a corrupt city councilwoman who is also completely ineffectual) advises him to try to kill Luke in a different manner, such as drowning or burning. To this ""Cottonmouth"" simply responds nah, I'll just shoot him some more, because that seems to work really well. To make everything worse, midway through the season after building a rivalry between Luke and ""Cottonmouth"" the entire time, ""Cottonmouth"" is abruptly killed in a stupid spat between him and his cousin. This apparently was a way to frame Luke for the murder, I guess to bring Misty Knight (the female detective that is constantly on Luke's case for no good reason) back into the plot since she was no longer relevant. This makes no sense, because Luke has an alibi for the murder, having been with Claire (nurse from Daredevil) being shot in the park at the time of the killing. So instead of a showdown with ""Cottonmouth"", Luke now battles for his life against a villain who we haven't even seen on screen the ENTIRE season until he abruptly shows up and starts shooting Luke with super bullets for reasons? There is no tension at all for this fight because we don't know anything about this person (except he's the one called Diamondback, who has been name dropped a couple of times) or what his motivations are for wanting to kill Luke. Honestly, I enjoy Luke Cage as a character, but as a show it is completely forgettable.",2016
3,This review will include spoilers as it is impossible to talk about the flaws of the TV show without details.,2016
1,"I really wanted to like this program, it has a great cast but the script is so very poor, the pacing is so slow, and the the action is rubbish. I could not watch past episode four where we see the same old story of old mentor gets killed, super hero emerges - ta da! It looks like an Eddie Murphy film to be honest - 99.9% black cast is way out of wack with the Politically Correct movement we expect today - wonder if anything will be said! I have no idea how this is scoring so well when it is frankly pants. I can only assume that the first reviews are from friends and family - it has to be - surly nobody actually likes watching pointless interactions ?",2016
6,"There's a lot to say about this series but I think the most obvious is how underwhelming the main character is. Colter comes off as rejected, docile, and often simple. There's background of him being a former cop but his intellect as Luke Cage seems far too simple for any skills of the sort. That along with the monotonous tone he takes throughout each episode really diminishes the character. The supporting cast works well and they are engaging and entertaining; especially Cottonmouth. The musical cameos are great as well and remind me of the old New York Undercover TV series when every episode featured someone new in the background. My only complaint is Luke Cage himself.. in the comics he was an active and athletic guy that didn't walk around in hoodies all of the time speaking with his ""inside voice."" This is like Luke Cage on Ritalin.",2016
5,"Just like the title...What happened to Luke Cage?! This was not the character we met in Jessica Jones. This dynamic,brooding, multi layered hero we were all dying to know more about. By far Luke was more interesting in Jones than in his own series and we can blame that on the showrunner Cheo Hodari Coker.",2016
1,"The Creator and main writer of Luke Cage was an English Major and it shows. This series had all drama and excitement of a college thesis. It's great that he referenced the great black mystery writer Walter Mosley and other masters of the genre like Dennis Lehane but that's as close to greatness he ever got. This show had some the most inept and amateurish writing of any Marvel franchise EVER. The dialogue was so predictable you could say the words along with the actors as they were speaking.Scene after scene had the characters DISCUSSING, the same issue over and over again where NOTHING happened. These writers failed to understand the most basic tenet of screen writing which requires CONFLICT.I don't mean physical fighting but mental and intellectual sparring with the characters inner life and struggles coming through in their subtext ‚Äì what they're thinking and not saying. There was zero subtext in almost every scene. On top of that their efforts at humor and wit were a bunch of tired old sayings and jokes we've heard a thousand time. ",2016
5,"I am so very disappointed with Netflix here as Luke Cage has all of the ingredients for greatness but suffers from a lack of villain power. Daredevil has a big physically overpowering presence to realistically challenge him throughout. Jessica Jones had a mentally superior adversary in Kilgrave, who again provided a challenge throughout. In fact both of the street heroes got their a$$es kicked on several occasions. Which is where Luke Cage fundamentally suffers.",2016
6,"It could have been the best show in the world, but it's just a tribute (in the words of Jack Black) It is basically the black version of Superman (character-wise, not plot-wise) - and just like superman, Luke is unbelievably geekish - a good, all-American, humble, Christian saint -- and without the ""Daredevilish"" struggle between good and evil, the outcome is as anachronistic as the original. We live in a world where heroes and villains cannot afford to be so superficial anymore - they have to be psychologically credible. But it isn't just a tribute to comics-superheros, but also - and perhaps mainly- to what is means to be black in America - from the endless namedropping and references down to the impossibly corny and repetitive ""I-have-a-dream""-style speeches. It feels more like a ceremony than a show. I'm not denying the importance of such a thing - the idea of a black superman is a very good and empowering one - so perhaps a tribute was in order - but just don't expect it to be anything else. There are a lot of boring moments (at least 6-episodes-worth of them)- endless monologues in attempt to inflate the characters and the action scenes are scarce and uninspiring. Funny thing - now I come to think of it - is that Luke's most interesting character development takes place in Jessica Jones and not in the show that is named after him. Perhaps it's just that Mike Colter's acting isn't deep and convincing enough to carry a whole show as a main character. However, there are enough redeeming moments to make this show an enjoyable-enough watch, and if you loved Jessica Jones and Daredevil, you'll have to watch Luke Cage - no way around it.",2016
4,"I went into this with zero expectations. I was a big fan of Daredevil and Jessica Jones so there was already a high precedent for Luke Cage to meet. unfortunately, Luke Cage was infinitely worse than either of those shows.",2016
4,"This was very compelling for the first 5-6 episodes. Without spoilers I can't explain, but afterwards it absolutely falls apart. It's almost like a different team of writers took over. Dialog becomes pedantic... even cringe-worthy. Story lines are boring and I simply stopped caring. Something clearly happened during production of this series. It's as if they crammed 3 seasons in to one and only cared about the 1st season. Characters introduced midway through are silly. Lengthy, meaningless, overly-dramatic scenes abound. This is definitely the worst Amazon original I've seen. It's a shame.... I've enjoyed Daredevil and Jessica Jones so much... but this is garbage. Don't get invested.",2016
6,"I was utterly disappointed with the much over hyped Luke Cage. In all fairness, I also was not a fan of Jessica Jones. As it to bored me beyond belief. So, where did this show go wrong.",2016
5,"I have to say that I was excited to see Luke Cage, he is a great superhero. However, I feel the series was poorly written. Was the bad guy really that bad. Where we supposed to feel sorry for him, and then we switch villains halfway through the series. The story was slow like the Music with no mix to it (Good Music but the same all the way through with no change).",2016
9,"After being thrilled by Daredevil, and also enjoying the Jessica Jones series, I headed for a binge session of Luke Cage with some trepidation. I thought it very possible, that like Suicide Squad, and Batman vs Superman, the hype could have been too much. It wasn't. In fact, the series isn't hyped enough.",2016
1,"Everything about this show pales in comparison to Daredevil and Jessica Jones (netflix prior 2 marvel series). Bad actor, bad script, bad villain. I tried really hard up to episode 8 for it to get better but it never did. Could not watch anymore. Hopefully the Iron fist and Punisher shows coming up will be better.",2017
6,"Great cast, great music, great character....but poor writing, direction, and editing. ",2016
1,Unfortunately Luke Cage shows that not every Marvel Netflix series is great. Admittedly Daredevil and Jessica Jones set the bar very high so I went into this show with high hopes.,2016
6,"I was really on board until episode 8. Then it just went downhill faster than a rock on a hill. I am really disappointed in this series, I hope they take all the feedback and improve season 2. Also, try not to make every episode feel like a filler episode. Luke could've ended this way sooner.",2017
5,"I've watched the pilot. Its slow and not much happens. We are still unsure who the villain is. If its the person we expect it to be, he needs powers to be a credible threat to Luke. ",2016
7,"Hello, dear reader - if by some miraculous coincidence you stumbled upon this review, hidden among others.",2017
9,"Listen, I'm not a movie guru, I don't study arts, I'm just your average Joe that loves movies. I've seen lots of movies, I don't discriminate, terror, drama, action, animated you name it, I can perfectly differentiate between a bad from a good movie, I don't need the biased comments of the so called movie critics on IMDb. Thanks God I didn't pay attention to all the misguided comments about this movie, Nocturnal Animals is a beautiful & stylish movie, great photography, solid acting and a solid plot that will stay with you long after you finish it. I don't understand why there's so much envy and hate in the film industry, the wannabe movie critics can't take that a guy who came from the fashion world actually can created a pretty good movie. My fellow reader, please don't miss the chance to see this movie.",2017
10,"Easily the best film I have seen this year. Great performance by all the actors, fantastic plot with a lot of deep meaning and a very atmospheric soundtrack. It's a very unique film. It reminds me of Basic Instinct but without the sex and drugs. It looks like a 90s masterpiece brought from back in time, a solid prove that Tom Ford is a great director.",2017
8,"So I just Finished Nocturnal Animals and to put as bluntly as possible I absolutely loved it and it might end up being one of my top 10 favorite movie of the year. Well it's basically two movies in one. One half appeals to my lust for grim blood soaked, dark genre fare while the other half plays like an interpersonal glossy drama that's just as compelling. Both feel as if they could hold entire films in their own right and grabbed me till the very end. It's much better if you go in cold so I won't really say much more but if you love a good thriller, crime drama or just good film making in general and it's playing near you please do yourself a favor and let Mr Tom Ford take you on a trip through some movie magic.",2017
10,"Nocturnal Animals is a dark and devilishly stylish thriller from Tom Ford, who knows a thing or two about style having worked as creative director for both Gucci and Yves Saint Lauren in the past. It could have been in danger of being a case of style over substance however, Ford's perfectionism makes this one of the most powerful films I've seen all year.",2016
6,"At the outset, i should make it clear that i don't think this is a bad film, but i felt the need to add a dissenting voice to the collection of positive reviews that i've read so far.",2016
9,"The second film from designer turned directory Tom Ford was not just a visual masterpiece but had great narrative. The plot of the movie which is three narratives combined into one and tells the story of Susan Morrow (Amy Adams) an art gallery owner who receives a manuscript of her ex-husband's (Jake Gyllenhaal) thriller novel dedicated to her. The way that the story was told was bold, strange and very unique to me. Even though a movie with three narratives might sound clumsy but it wasn't, the stories of different time lines did not overlap each other rather it made the story complete with showing different aspects of the characters.",2017
9,"That's some terrifying stuff right there! Fashion designer Tom Ford has written and directed his second movie, a multifaceted revenge thriller which is even better than his first, 2009's ""A Single Man"".",2017
8,"This film was a wonderful exhibition of acting and cinematography. You can clearly see the work of Tom Ford in it and there are many things that draw comparisons to his debut film 'a single man.' Stylistically it is similar, most notably through the musical score. What impressed me most about it was the symbolism of the book that Amy Adams reads. You can clearly see that the wife of Tony represents Amy Adams' character in real life and what she used to be, from Edward's perspective. The character of Ray Marcus seems to represent what Susan then became from Edwards perspective after the terrible things she did to him. Ford also drops various visual cues in the story, such as the red couch that he finds his dead wife and daughter on, that represent things in the real-life narrative. Overall, the film was a technical wonder. The only reason I couldn't rate it higher was because the script didn't quite match the other aspects of the film and the themes the film was trying to explore were unclear. However, the film remains a harrowing piece of work and a great second feature film by Tom ford.",2017
10,"With a sudden thump on the window a wild bird is stunned. It is reduced to a heap of feathers and a barely beating heart. Through fantastic imagery, talented and stylish actors at the top of their game, an amazing and fastidious director, and an enthralling and thrilling story, the characters in the film go through transformations similar to that of the dazed bird. So did I. The film resonated deeply with me. ""I just can't do this anymore."" I was shocked with this line that was said to me in the same situation and manner.",2016
2,"What can I say about this movie? I think it's overrated, over-hyped, and overpraised. I believe media loves this movie because they're actually praising Tom Ford the stylist, not Tom Ford the filmmaker. ",2016
1,"Its an uninspired and non-surprising moving. It's like Tom Ford thought ""hey, let's make something with art"" and used all tools he could find in his lunchbox. The end is non-surprising, the story between is non-surprising and it has logical deficits. Why does the sheriff not look at Tony, when he is searching for the killer of his wife and daughter? Why did Tony talk and talk and talk, but didn't shoot the killer in the first moment - haven't he seen in movies, what happens if I talk and talk to the killer? The only interesting character in the complete movie is the sheriff. The start of the movie - old naked dancing woman - is awful. If you have the impulse to run out the cinema - it is the right moment. This movie is a waste of lifetime.",2016
1,"Not sure why this is getting such slavishly, raving, reviews (although I suspect it's because of the 'luvvie' aspect thanks to the director). It was painful, tiresome and somewhat hideous to sit through. It felt like a very poor nod to David Lynch, and the theme of despair and lack of redemption didn't add to it's lack of charm.",2016
1,Because both of the stories told are lame.,2016
4,"I agree with a lot of people here who say this movie is undoubtedly one of the best looking movies of the year. It's probably no surprise coming from a director like Tom Ford, who was a fashion designer for Gucci before chasing filmmaking. This movie looks like a Gucci ad for the majority of its runtime and it's hard to fault him for having an impeccable attention to detail. Whether it's a closeup of Amy Adams' face or a wide shot of a deserted landscape, Ford certainly has a hell of an eye for a shot.",2017
1,"Don't you love my title? Don't you love how I make a statement? Just like this piece of crap film thinks it does. I don't think the writer realized it was a movie not an abstract painting. Movies have purposes, movies have a beginning, a middle, and an end; movies that build to something usually lead somewhere but this pile of junk leads nowhere! Frustratingly nowhere! Hence the title of my review. It builds and builds and has no release it just ends abruptly if you want to call it an ending. so our leading lady is a clich√©. She's a career woman married to a career man whose having an affair which is not shocking at all. She was married once before and her ex-husband,a novelist, sends her his book. Most of the movie is about the guy in the story whose wife and daughter are kidnapped and raped. He works for over a year with a detective to catch the murderers. Now why the entire movie was not that story instead is beyond me. I could give a crap less about how she left her novelist husband after aborting his child just to end up with a cheating husband. Who cares about that storyline since it had no point! That storyline ends with her being stood up in a restaurant drinking scotch. The end. Really? I also found out Tom Ford designs clothes. He should probably stick with that. And the beginning of this movie with fat naked women dancing in slow motion was supposed to be some crap statement when really it was just uncomfortable to watch and stupid. About as pointless as the film itself. The film creator is the man and the audience the woman in my mind. Having said that the ""man"" is pleased. They made money, managed to get brilliant actors to do their crap film, and live happily ever after in their mansions. I the ""woman"" or audience if you will am left unsatisfied and $9 shorter but hey glad i could contribute to their yachts. And for those who like this junk and think I'm too dumb to grasp metaphors if thats what this movie thinks it is, one big metaphor for something, I urge you to see a film called Silent House. That is a film full of metaphors and statements that work with a storyline that builds to an actual finale. This is the worst film of the year and I'm saying that in a year when the remake of Ghostbusters came out with a frigging female cast (ohh guess that makes me sexist) as well as the release of the ever so pointless sequel to Independence day. But this film? Absolutely terrible. Rubbish as the Brits say. I wouldn't Netflix it. I wouldn't Redbox it. I'd wait for it to come on Lifetime if you really want to see it that way you can take shots during the commercial breaks just to make it tolerable.",2016
1,"Unfortunately, Nocturnal Animals was completely unbelievable right from the beginning, with dialog that seemed written by a machine. Given the 'novel' idea, that might have been excused, but all the dialog in the supposed 'real world' was just as bad. The only actor able to shine through this pretentious crap was Michael Shannon, but after a time his character just disappeared from the story. And what was Michael Sheen doing in this movie? And the nude fat dancers? It really added up to nothing. And oh my goodness, what a payback for leaving a man and aborting his child: He got her to go to a dinner meeting AND DIDN'T SHOW UP! Wow! Now that's payback in a BIG WAY! Sorry, but this exercise in audience manipulation was a real disappointment after A Single Man.",2016
1,"Nocturnal Animals is your typical revenge tale where innocent loser gets rekt by people whose favorite past time is being evil stereotypes. Then sudden personality change and sweet, sweet revenge. Or not.",2017
3,"Just got back from the theater. Don't understand the rating. Reading the reviews ... I feel lonely. I feel like these critics got their job too easy, or by scheming, or by sheer luck. Am I the only one who laughed out loud when Tony shot himself in the groin? Or when he, blinded by a well deserved blow to the head, stumbled out of the trailer? For those of you who think that I didn't understand the inner turmoil of the writer pictured there as a physical struggle.. let me put your mind at ease. I did and so should everyone, because this movie is a like a fake easy test you get just to feel good about yourself. No thanks. After twenty years this is his revenge? Showing her that he wrote a crap book? Making her feel alone, left behind, like he felt back then? Making her understand what he has been through, what she missed? Big whoop, she already knew and beside hurting a bit she didn't do anything about it. You know, like in real life. Tom Ford, master of the cinema verite.",2016
2,"The first few minutes were great - why didn't Ford just keep going? He could have made a totally absurdist/surrealist film that might have worked! There were hints of such a film here and there - the guy sitting on the toilet outdoors, the ridiculous dress that looked like the main component was electrical tape, etc. If you want to ""challenge"" the audience, that would be one way to do it. As it stands, I don't know what he was trying to accomplish here.",2016
1,"You know those movies that you are angry at when they end because you can't get those 2 hours of your life back? Well, this is one of them. I could even give this a one word review but IMDb need 10 lines and that one word may be deemed offensive to some readers.",2016
1,"As Tom Hanks' character in Big would say: ""I don't get it"". Why anyone is talking about this film in terms of awards flummoxes me.",2017
1,"Being unhappy and confused despite excess wealth is not within my personal experience, and this film did not enlighten me as to the root causes of unhappiness in any form. The slow pace of this story turned me off within minutes. The confusing and frequent flashbacks indicates to me that there really is no worthwhile story to tell. The gratuitous nudity is unnecessary and too brief to be exciting. The writing in contrast to the stark visuals is as flabby as the women in the opening scenes. Adultery by a spouse claiming to be traveling for business is clich√© as is the aggrieved spouse's denial. The lack of compelling story probably increased pop corn sales.",2016
3,"I personally thought Days of the Future Past to be the best of the series. And as it turns out, Apocalypse is the worst one to date.",2016
7,"In what concerns special effects it is the most stunning movie I have ever seen and only for that it is worth to be seen. Scene succeeds scene in hallucinating speed. In a society where humans live together with mutants not always in very friendly terms, the first mutant is awaken after thousands of years (he was worshiped as a god in Ancient Egypt where the movie starts) and seeing that the world is not good he decides to destroy it to create a new society and a new world order above which he would reign. Then a group of young X-Men (boys and girls) start a fight against his purpose in order to save mankind from destruction. This struggle unites humans and also a few mutants who have extraordinary superpowers they use in the amazing scenes above referred. A movie that keeps you rooted to your seat from the first to the last image.",2016
10,"Okay, this is already the fourth superhero film we have gotten so far this year. The fact that it's this good blows my mind, it's the sixth entry in the main X-Men series, and it might be the third best after X2 and Days of Future Past. Oscar Isaac gives an outstanding performance as the mutant menace: Apocalypse, he was the highlight of the film right next to Fassbender's Magneto (who never fails to deliver). In a year with pathetic and disappointing superhero film villains so far, Apocalypse gives us the layered and threatening performance we want from our villains. Evan Peters returns as Quicksilver once more to give us an amazing scene that tops the one from Days of Future Past. The newcomers are fantastic and exciting and we will certainly see them again in the future. They also finally got Cyclops right! Forget about Rotten Tomatoes and go see this film opening weekend, you won't regret!",2016
7,"X-Men: Apocalypse is the sequel to Days of Future Past and takes place  about a decade later in the '80s. This movie entertained me from start  to finish and I can't say I was ever bored. But there are a lot of  things I was not satisfied with while watching. Starting off with the  good, Magneto and Professor X continue to be the best parts of these  movies. Michael Fassbender as Magneto is amazing and he has a really  emotional scene towards the beginning which got me locked into the  film. James McAvoy is also great as Xavier. The internal battles inside  Xavier's head were riveting. I really liked the new cast of the younger  X-Men, like Jean Grey, Storm, Nightcrawler, and Cyclops. Quicksilver  has another awesome scene just like the previous movie. The action is  handled very well for the most part. The first half of the movie is  terrific, but the second half brings it down.  Apocalypse as the villain was OK for me. Some scenes worked well and  others didn't. I was always skeptical of Oscar Isaac as Apocalypse and  I still don't think he was the best choice. He is just like Jesse  Eisenberg as Lex Luthor for me. Apocalypse is also a small mutant  compared to the others for some reason and he's just another villain  who is obsessed with destroying the world, and his motivations are  thin. Jennifer Lawrence was a boring Mystique. She just seems  uninspired throughout the run-time and becomes tedious since she uses  the personality over and over again to play the character. Some mutants  were completely wasted here with Psylocke and Angel. There's an entire  sequence in a secret lab and it seemed there for only one reason: the  cameo of a specific person. While it was fun to watch, it didn't do  much of anything for the story in the long run. The entire thing could  have been removed and the movie would have been the same. The final  battle felt underwhelming with the whole global extinction. The problem  is they don't show any civilians dying; it's just buildings coming  apart, making it hard to care about the situation.   Overall, X-Men: Apocalypse is a disappointing sequel to First Class and  Days of Future Past. But it is not at all a bad movie. Magneto and  Professor X are once again great, Apocalypse is a mixed bag, the pacing  for the movie is all over the place, and the dull second half just  brings the film down from the really good first half.  X-Men: Apocalypse gets a B-.",2016
7,"X Men apocalypse adds nothing new to a landscape filled with superhero films and lots of X Men films of old, but just cause it doesn't add anything new doesn't make it a bad film. \",2016
1,"This movie is astoundingly terrible. The first 45 minutes of the film feel like bad long exposition and yet nothing really happens, a mutant appears in some random scene and they are recruited by either Apocalypse or the X-Men. The writing is all over the place and we don't get to know the characters, they're simply put there.",2016
7,"So after loving DOFP, circumstances (eg: Holiday)caused me to have to wait several weeks after the release date to watch this movie and before showtime I had heard mixed reviews, but with most of them leaning towards a poor one I went in without any expectations so that I may avoid any potential disappointments. ",2016
1,Wait a minute.. just wait a minute...,2016
8,As you can probably gather I thought this was another very good addition to the X-Men franchise. Whilst it doesn't hit the heady heights of Days of Future Past it still is a really good watch and I fail to see why it has had a mixed press.,2016
7,"The word ""apocalypse"" brings to mind an end-of-the world event of biblical proportions. X- MEN APOCALYPSE brings to mind some Japanese anime and a yearning for the better X- men movies of the past. The third in this ""new trilogy"" that began with X-MEN FIRST CLASS, the franchise reached its high point in the epic X-MEN DAYS OF FUTURE PAST but now tips back down to a rather typical tale of good vs evil intertwined with the usual hero's journey. Thankfully the masterful execution of dialogue and acting chops saves this film from sinking into mediocrity.",2016
7,"Normally I am not overly keen on superhero movies, but still do get around to watch them in order to have seen them and also to be entertained for whatever worth they should have. However, I will say that the 2016 ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" was somewhat of a surprise to me; a surprise in a good way.",2016
1,"I loved the Apocalypse storyline of the 90s animated series so I was pretty stoked about the idea of a movie centering around the Apocalypse character, it's a shame I have to live with it now.",2016
7,"Maybe it's because I had a bigger expectation for this film, but it was aiight. In the movie there is a scene where mutant students come out of the theater after watching ""Return of the Jedi"". And says something along the lines of the third installment being the worst. And that basically applies to this film, because in my opinion it's the weakest compared to the previous two X-Men movies. It's in no way a bad movie, but it just wasn't anything all that amazing either. Because the editing and progression of the story just wasn't all that compelling or interesting. Watching this movie was like watching ""Rocky 4"", it's alright but just not good as ""Rocky"" and ""Rocky 2"". The plot is basically about Apocalypse getting resurrected, finding his four horsemen while the new group of students get recruited into Xavier Institute. With it focusing in on Magneto the most next to Apocalypse with his side story and what makes him tick. It really did show how how much of a human character Magneto really is. I mean even the kindest people out there has a breaking point when you push them to their limit. I guess the human side of Magneto and the understanding of where he is coming from to a degree is what makes him one of the most popular comic book villains out there. The other horsemen that Apocalypse chooses just seemed to be shoehorned into the movie. There is few scenes that did stand out and it's basically the super action sequences. There is the introduction scene, Quicksilver to the rescue scene, Wolverine going berserker rage mode, Quicksilver fighting Apocalypse, Professor X going Freddy Krueger and Phoenix Force. So overall I don't regret seeing this movie in the theater, I do however regret seeing it in 4D. Because I personally thought it just wasn't worth it for this one. You can tell a lot about a man if you give him the crown and what he chooses to do with his power and how he treats people that are less fortunate. And I liked that type of message in this movie. Although the whole thing of the team getting together and bonding like a family isn't anything new but was nicely done. So I give this movie a 7.4/10.",2016
7,"I loved all the X-Men movies, including X-Men Origins: Wolverine. I was so hyped when I heard they were creating an X-Men movie with Apocalypse in it. I have always loved superhero movies about the end of days. I will say specific parts that I loved and thought about this film and how I would recommend it.",2016
7,"The first X-Men trilogy was weirdly obsessed with Wolverine, and by extension Rouge. I never understood why... This new trilogy is obsessed with Mystique just because America's sweetheart Jennifer Lawrence is portraying her. I don't mind it, but Mystique is no hero, she is a devious villain! And Beast should be well a Beast, but a handsome Nicholas Hoult is better to look at I presume. Storm is not a villain, she is a beloved X-Men character that has never been done justice. These are things that enrage fans over and over again.",2016
8,"*MILD SPOILER ALERT FOR X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST* X-Men: Apocalypse is directed by X-men veteran Bryan Singer, and co-written by Simon Kinberg (as well as Singer himself) and stars James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Oscar Isaac, and Hugh Jackman for 4 minutes (no, seriously). The film takes place in an alternate timeline created after the events of Days of Future Past, with the ripples of Wolverine burning the Gray's Sports Almanac and changing the course of history. This causes major retcons to other films in the continuity (looking at you Wolverine: Origins) as the 1980's setting is the picturesque backdrop for the conflict between the Mutants and humans. Confusion to the timeline aside, this film on paper is a slightly superior film to Days of Future Past, but in execution (while a good film) is lacking. The characters were engaging, but the trailers much like Avengers: Age of Ultron pitched a different film. While not as disappointing as Ultron was, it does have similar pitfalls and does falter. If you are a fan of the previous X-men films (except 3 and Wolverine: Origins. Those movies don't exist and they're also horrible) and as long as you monitor your expectations, you will enjoy this film. During the time of civil expansion in Egypt, En-Sabah-Nur (Apocalypse, also I have no idea how I know to spell that off by heart) is the first Mutant of his kind. He has built an empire and is seen as a god, but he is not immortal. He seeks out means to treat his lifespan, but during that time, there is a coup to overthrow and kill the false god, and in the process he is imprisoned in a collapsed pyramid forced into a several millennia long slumber (cue the title sequence) waiting to regain his strength and retake what is his. Since this is an alternate timeline, and the later X-men films take place in the not too distant future, let's assume that Apocalypse didn't recover. So, because of ""time travel"" the ripple created a timeline where Apocalypse will roam free (I'm really getting tired of typing the word ""Time""). After the events of Days of Future Past, Magneto has shed his old identity, started a new life, Charles Xavier has reopened the X-mansion, and Mystique is on a crusade to liberate mutants all at the same time Apocalypse indoctrinates mutants as he calls them ""The Four Horsemen"" in efforts of bringing about god-like proportions of destruction (MASS HYSTERIA). The film is shot extremely well, with good cinematography, good use of costume design, soundtrack, score, make-up, time-period and everything seems well realized. The film is written to an acceptable degree, with a fantastic arch for Magneto, an interesting arch for Charles and Mystique, and a good arch for Jean Grey. Tye Sheridan and Sophie Turner really shine as a young Cyclops and Jean Grey, giving a believable relationship. All of the newcomers do give stellar performances (although one is stoic in particular) Storm, Angel, Nightcrawler and a serviceable portrayal of Psylocke. Oscar Isaac does an acceptable job as Apocalypse, but he wasn't as developed or menacing as I would have hoped, and the same can be said for the four horsemen (Psylocke, Storm, Angel, and excluding one character since their arch is good) especially with the context and history of the characters, (I know that you can't cram that much lore into 2 hours *cough* Batman V. Superman) there could have been some exploration of the characters and their relationship with Apocalypse. For example, Storm in the comics was homeless, a gutterpunk and saw that her abilities made her a goddess. The relationship that she could have had with Apocalypse, a fountain of seemingly unlimited power could have been interesting. Or Jean Grey; her conflict of controlling her power, and how someone like Apocalypse would affect her. The best aspects of the film are the characters of Charles Xavier, Mystique, Magneto, Quicksilver and Jean Grey with all of their archs being interesting, but also takes a long time to resolve them. There is growth in these characters, and visual progression, but it takes a long time for them to get fully realized. Quite possibly the best scene in the film is the ""Quicksilver"" Sequence (similar to DOFP) but perfected and dominates the previous. I will not spoil what song is used during the sequence but it is a good choice. X-men: Apocalypse is a good movie with great moments, but a few flaws. But those do not allocate into a great film, as the flaws are too noticeable to hold it back. This is not a bad film, and should not be compared to the likes of any other superhero franchise, since it has a different formula. It is not Captain America: Civil War, or Batman V. Superman. It is a FOX owned Marvel property, and not Disney nor DC. The key to enjoying this film is to manage expectations. To look for how the film is interesting, such as parallels it makes to other films (it makes an interesting parallel to Return of the Jedi) and the biggest thing lacking in this film is risk. With an altered timeline, one would assume that the future is set in stone, so that for the most part the characters would be safe and that the world would not end, and while that does take away some of the weight of the climax, there is still risk as some characters do die in the process. Apparently there will be an extended cut on the home video release, which is something that I am looking forward to exploring. This is a good film. With good character, a few shoehorned Easter eggs (seriously, Wolverine?) an interesting setup for the future, and some depth. It may not blow your mind, but it won't disappoint too much. Just don't expect Days of Future Past. Or X-men 3. A good movie: 7.5/10",2016
2,"Another X-Men movie.. and again, not much of anything happens. There is a plot, yes, but it is poorly written and lacks substance/soul/meaning. The attitude of ""I don't care"" is what I came out with after seeing this movie. Instead of having a soul, it feels like a bunch of things put together in order to make money. You see characters, but aside from Quicksilver, which felt shoved in, no one really has an attempt at an arc.",2016
1,"They ruined all x-men movies you ever seen I saw all X-Men movies, i am fan of X-men, BUT this one was really awful. I can't even know how to describe this crap. Can't believe this movie was 2.5 hours film that was actually got into production. Its an insult of xmen movies. Its a Power Rangers movie not X-Men.",2016
10,"I am horrified by the people on the message boards here on this movie's threads. They're fighting each other like a bunch of hungry animals. Since when does everyone started listening to the critics? I mean, yes, to have an idea before watching a movie is good, but that's not the case these days. Critics are taking movies way too seriously these days. It's just a source of entertainment. Your life does not depend on it. Stop bad mouthing this movie for others. Okay, sorry for my rant but this has gotten out of control. Now getting back to the movie, let's just say it delivered what it promised. This movie was amazing. It really felt like you were watching something Apocalyptic. Although I don't have had a problem with Bryan Singer's X Men movies, unlike a bunch of whiny babies, this one actually felt like it was an X Men movie. A sheer resemblance of what we saw in X Men cartoons, both evolution and the 1990 ones. We actually saw the main characters of this movie in their mutant form. I have loved how Bryan always preferred acting over action in his other movies, but this one, it consists of both. I have also seen critics saying that this movie is complete CGI. Well it's not like you can do actual Apocalyptic level scenes without having any CGI effects. That's just crazy. And the CGI in this movie is beyond awesome. I already smell an Oscar for CGI for this movie. Oscar Isaac was so impressive in this movie. Even though he was buried under make up and what not, you could actually feel his performance. Michael and James once again give awesome performances. Expected nothing less from Jennifer Lawrence. At least these movies actually give spotlight to the female actresses *cough* *Marvel* *cough*. The new actors were great. So talented. Tye, Sophie, Alexandra, Kodi and of course Evan Peters were all good in their respective roles. This movie might feel a different because of it's whole world at stake thing. This is the first time X Men has done this, and they succeed really good at it. It had a perfect balance of action, humor, emotion and mutants. It was like watching a live action version of those X Men cartoons we grew up watching. Once again, please dear my friends, who would love to see these guys in MCU, it's not happening anytime soon. Let's just get over it, okay? The producer of these movies has already announced a bunch of new movies under Fox. There are X Men TV shows coming out soon, so let us enjoy these while you guys enjoy yours okay?",2016

1,"Movie was so boring I wanted to walk out of the movie cinema. Usual lets bring bad guy back, find some other bad guys, destroy the world with mind numbing blah. No twists. No nothing.

8,"The 8th installment of the X-men franchise (excluding ""Deadpool"") blasts off with this big-budgeted extravaganza featuring the long awaited super-villain Apocalypse. After the huge success of ""Days of Future Past,"" Bryan Singer gets another go at the franchise. The film successfully captures the spectacle, humor, heart, and awesomeness that filmgoers have come to expect from the X-men franchise further solidifying that Bryan Singer is THE MAN to direct the X-men movies.",2016

Besides, it gets so much better! I'm sick of all the reviews that were published right after the first episode was released and people are listening to it as they think that is for the entire show when it is not. So, do the people who actually have waited for this show since March and are actually enjoying it, and don't spread negative hate around social media and whatnot because I surely am not the only one to see the show expand and explore. Not saying everyone has to like it, but please don't brainwash other people into thinking it is bad when it's not.

4,"After the wife and I saw the movie we were disappointed to find out they weren't going to make the next in the series for the big screen. Our woe was turned to hope when we learned that it would instead be turned into a TV series. Sadly the good news stopped there. The sets look good and the story seems to be staying loyal to the book (for the most part), but the major downfall is both the acting and the special effects. The acting seems like that of your average high school drama class, lines that need pauses between them are blurted out quickly and with sloppy delivery, even the body language is lacking in any real commitment. While some of the fight scenes look good for the most part the entire feel of the acting, fighting and effects can be easily summed up as power rangers. To touch quickly on the effects, while TV shows have much smaller budgets than feature length movies I feel some effects should have been left out in favour of old school tricks rather than cheap looking garbage. By far the worst part was seeing the Shadowhunters tech, mixing high tech gadgets with this magical world feels like Bilbo Baggins texting Gandalf for advice.",2016
10,"Don't let the negative reviews on this show persuade you not to watch it. May of the people that have watched Shadowhunters and disliked it didn't do their research before the show came out. The directors and creators said many times you had to come to this show with an opened mind. The show is slightly different than the books because they creators wanted it to be fresh and for the book readers not to know everything that is going to happen. I'd recommend reading the first book before you watch the show to freshen your mind or while you watch the show because there are many things that you don't notice in the book that they bring up in the show. I's better for you to see what the show is about yourself then to see it through what others tell you. Stay opened minded, distance yourself from the books, and don't be quick to judge from the first episode, the show gets better after each episode.",2016
8,"When I saw the previews I was nervous it would be like the deplorable movie. I am a huge fan of the series.It makes sense to keep it a series instead of trying to make movies of all the movies. I will be interested to see how they will follow the books. Will each season be a single book? Will they combine books. Either way, I'm excited to keep watching. The casting in the movie was horrible. Magnus was a joke. The casting for the series is spot on. I'm pretty picky when it comes to casting. I am disappointed with the institute as others have stated. I enjoyed Simon and Jace's humor. I find the use of the different weapons interesting and didn't think the effects were cheesy. Please please remember that it is very difficult to make an adaptation of a book into a movie or series. We were spoiled with Harry Potter and the Hunger Games. I'm definitely going to keep watching.",2016
1,"I'm not exactly the best critic who spots a terrible actor or bad shot from miles away. Usually, I'm quite an unfussy viewer. Or at least I'd like to think so.",2016
8,"I enjoyed the pilot, despite the changes I really liked the pilot. So many other people are complaining about changes made to the TV show but guess what? They said ahead that there were going to be changes so many other people should have anticipated these changes. And apparently they did not, even though they claim otherwise. Yes, spoiler alert, they did change Clary's age, Luke's occupation and other minor stuff like that. Plus they have to make changes to appeal to everybody, not just book readers which I am. So really most of the changes are small, it's still following the same storyline so I think people need to chill out and realize that there were going to be changes anyway. And people are also complaining about the acting. Look, I'll be the first to admit that no one is going to win any Oscars or golden globes here but let's remember that about 60% of the cast is not very experienced. They are extremely new actors and it does show but I would not call it horrible, maybe shaky at some parts but overall I thought it was decent and I've seen much worse before believe me. And now for my final complaint: the ignorant people that are comparing this to twilight, calling it another twilight, and someone even saying that it was twilight fan fiction??? First of all TMI is WAY different from twilight, don't know where these certain people are getting that from. Second of all, I believe that TMI is WAY better than freaking Twilight. What, it's similar because it has romance in it and because there are vampires in it? Oh okay so every book, movie, or TV show that has romance and vampires is a twilight ripoff right? Get out of here with that. The vampires here DO NOT sparkle, in fact they burn if the sun touches them, and the romance? It's way more fleshed out and way more organic that the twilight romance, I can tell you that. So really I think people need to calm down and accept the changes. Plus, this is a pilot people, pilots are not always the best, sometimes they aren't very good and even though I thought the pilot was decent that still may have been the case here. Give the show a shot, don't just give up after the first episode because it could very well get better as the actors will have time to grow into their characters and maybe all of the people moaning and complaining will adapt to the changes. Believe me I HATE when I read a book that I really like and the adaption is no where near like the book but I don't feel like they changed so much here to warrant so much complaining.",2016
1,"Bad acting and even worse choreography, loads of clich√© moments. All the cringing i did made me my abs sore. Watch one episode and you'll see what i'm talking about. And those dumb looking ""lightsaber"" swords, i mean really? REALLY? All of these new shows being vomited out these days... Quality over quantity! Most of you will probably find this ""review"" very harsh, but i have had enough of these half ass'd shows popping up everywhere. I crave fantasy and adventure, if you're like me i'd recommend finding something else to escape from reality with. Send me a message if you'd like to discover other shows within the same genre, i'd be happy to help anyone out.",2016
4,"Another adolescent fantasy tripe. Seriously, who keeps thinking it's a good idea to make these. Throw a bunch of teens dressed in tight clothes into a pot, add some demons and superpowers, and then layer it with a bunch of cheesy dialogue to explain what's going on. Sooooo tiresome. At no time will you ever believe they are in any danger, or any emotions they are conveying is real, or that they themselves believe a single word that is coming out of their mouths.",2016
8,"Shadowhunters, although not amazing and award-worthy, is still relatively enjoyable to watch. There are many aspects of the TV show that need improvement, but that doesn't mean that there aren't things the show has nailed. I personally have not read TMI yet and I feel that people are comparing the book and TV series too scrutinously. I feel that having not read the books has helped me enjoy the show rather than be frustrated that the show isn't sticking to the books. Among the cons, the acting of certain characters is quite cringe-worthy although some are new to acting so we can't judge them on this. The script was also pretty cheesy, but then again it reflects the target audience. Let's just hope that'll improve later on. Apart from that, I think a lot of us can agree that the institute design was not that great, it was way too techy and didn't feel homely at all. The pros, on the other hand, include SIMON! Simon is amazing in all respects! Alec and Isabelle were great throughout. Jace's character improved towards the end of season 1 which is great. I didn't know how to feel about Magnus at first but currently, at the close of season 1, I'm liking his character which is very much like Jack Sparrow, as youtuber Christine Riccio pointed out. With regards to Clary, I love her relationship with Simon, apart from that I don't think she grew much until towards the end of season 1, like Jace. I'm hoping for more improvement regarding the characters in the upcoming season.",2016

Did Shadowhunters blow me away? No, but it did manage to pull me in, very slowly. The show begins with a lot of potential but also with a lot of issues. It's cheesy, the acting was a bit off for some of the actors, it doesn't have the best special effects and the script lacks here and there. And yet I didn't give up on it and I'm so glad I didn't.",2016
10,"I really like this show! I honestly have no idea why people are complaining about how they picked the characters and that the show isn't following the book. They SAID they were going to add more twists and turns to make it better and more fun for the people who already read the books. I am currently reading city of lost souls and I think that the cast and the director and everybody else who puts in work for this show is doing an amazing job! I love the way they chose the cast for the series! I think everybody fits their roles perfectly! In the movie I had problems towards Jace's character since he looked nothing like I imagined while reading the books (besides the fact that his hair was blonde). The characters in the show really lend themselves to the characters in the book. But, the only problem I have is with Jace. He is a really good actor and I think he delivers his lines perfectly! But, where did all the arrogance go? I haven't seen that much arrogance in Jace throughout the show so I hope the script writers will try to incorporate more arrogance in his lines throughout the next couple of episodes/seasons. Besides that, I love the show! I love how even though I read the books I still don't know exactly what's going to happen! Thanks for making this show! Definitely an improvement from the movie!",2016
10,"I personally love this show so much! It took about five episodes to get above just decent, I'd rate the first five episodes a C- or 5.5/10 but after episode 5 I give the show a B+ or 8/10! Clace finally get a bit of chemistry in episode 7, Alec is perfect, the script gets slightly better with every episode I promise! The plot deviates from the books but that just keeps it interesting! The key points and incidents are definitely still there though. Malec is my favourite part of the show. I'm honestly so obsessed with this now and seriously hope it gets renewed for a season 2! That's when the storyline and character development would really get brilliant in my opinion. The cast are getting better every week and the only thing I have against it now really is the CGI/special effects but I get that they're on a low budget so I forgive that. Script still needs work but already seeing improvements as I said. If you are a fan of the books, movie or supernatural fantasy dramas you'll love this!",2016
10,I love it! Some of you are very harsh. The cast is doing a good job. They play their roles good.,2016
1,"I want to preface my review by saying, I'm completely open to changes in the story if they're done well. This is not done well. The acting is stiff, and horrible, and lines (that are cheesy) are delivered without feeling. The fight scenes are bad, and also cheesy. The special effects are not done well, to put it nicely. Honestly, the only thing good about this show was that the actors and actresses were styled impeccably: perfect, hair, makeup, clothes. But what does that all matter when the rest is horrible? I'm a huge fan of the books, and while I was disappointed with how the movie hugely deviated from the original story line, I still liked the movie and appreciated it. This new show is just bad and extremely disappointing.",2016
10,"The show can't be judged based on the pilot and a comparison with the movie or books will lead to a bias. The show needs to be seen with an open mind and although it started off with cheesy lines and poor visual effects, the improvement is evident with each episode as actors find common ground with their characters and create chemistry on screen. The visual effects also seem to be improving and more realistic over time. We see the vulnerable side of many characters as the season is progressing, such as the Lightwood siblings, whereby Alec learns to open up and come into terms with the feelings he has been compressing and Isabelle is torn between her fun-loving persona and finding approval from her family. Not to mention humor is off the charts with sassy remarks from the warlock and mundane! The twists, turns and deviations from the book gives the show an edge of suspense. Looking forward to the next episode and hopefully another Season because some amazing characters are still yet to take center stage! As a reader of the series, all I can say is.... it's about to get intense and emotionally empowering!",2016
7,"I've read almost all the books, but the story of Clary, Jace, Simon, Isabelle, Alec and Magnus... That one I know from start to finish. Can't say I appreciate the movie, but I've found this TV show to be quite interesting. Sure, it has deviated from the books, but I hardly know a TV show based on a book that hasn't. Even movies do it all the time. So I gave it a shot and I'm willing to follow it through. If I wanted to see the story of the books then I'd read the books. When I watch Shadowhunters is really to see what they're willing to do differently. And so far although it hasn't been great, it isn't poor either. I've found it to be a good show to follow. And until it becomes impossible to watch then I'll continue seeing it.",2016
2,"I absolutely adore the books and the I loved the movie too, but this- this is just messing with the fans. The cast for the movie was PERFECT. The movie followed the storyline properly. The TV show misses out on a load of little bits that made the movie so good and the books even better. The characters threw the story off completely and the clothing also disappointed me. A lot of Isabelle's elegance and strength-for example- was lost, and the cast really didn't bring anything special to the show. Although I can't say I'd give the movie a 10/10, the actors played their characters perfectly. I honestly can't say the same for this. ",2016

10,I was very excited when I heard they were making this into a TV series as I loved the books. I enjoyed the film but felt that it lacked something. This series has more than made up for what was lacking in the film. I love the cast and I think the chemistry between jace and clary is gonna be amazing as the series goes on. I love the way they have changed the institute to make it more high tech. I like how they have made Luke to have more of a role in this as a police officer rather than a shop owner. Certain things are different to the books but so far they are making the story even better. If you love the supernatural then this series is a must.,2016
10,"As a fan of fantasy story, I am totally in love with it. It is true that the first season had some issues or a lack in acting, I would say that I am a little disappointed in Katherine McNamara and just a bit in Dominic Sherwood acting but he has another qualities. As for Matthew Daddario, he really brought to life his character in a special way and I think we couldn't ask more from him, he is just perfect. Overall even most of the actors are young, I enjoyed watching the show and I have no comment on the special effects but is always room for improvement or better and they definitely deserve a chance and the TV show has a really big potential.

A very good beginning for Freeform, we're gonna see drama, jokes, love and very interesting things Well so far so good! I think the casting is a lot better than they did in the movie and the story is following well with very few necessary details so far. The fight scenes have been great and the special affects has been very well done. I am looking forward to seeing how they carry out the rest of this first season",2016
5,"With all the controversy back in 2016 over the #Oscarssowhite shambles, it seems that in 2017 the Academy has made a conscious effort to include as much diversity into the show as they possibly can. Unfortunately, the downside of that is that films like 'Moonlight', which are in reality very average, get recognition they don't deserve and people are fooled into thinking they are better than they actually are. 'Moonlight' is a simple film, in fact it's far too simple. There is almost nothing thought-provoking or interesting that happens for the entire 110 minute run time. Yet somehow it's up for a plethora of awards. Go figure.",2017
10,"Moonlight is one of the most beautiful and heart-wrenching films that I have ever seen. Many users are expressing disdain or presumed it to be dull. Yet, to see it as such misses the whole point of the film. Moonlight wasn't intended to overtly wow us or give us knowledge about something we didn't already know. Rather the film allowed us to enter and follow a life that I'm sure many have never considered living. Yes, we know some about poverty, queerness, masculinity, and Blackness individually, but to see the conflict of it all so succinctly woven together allowed the complexity of some folks lives to be seen in an unadulterated way. Moonlight wasn't supposed to give us some grandiose finale or even answers, but simply present a narrative that we often don't see. And that's what makes it so simple, painful, yet outstandingly beautiful. ",2017
5,"Moonlight represents the end product of a collaboration between Barry Jenkins who wrote the screenplay based on a play by Tarell Alvin McCraney. It has an amazing score of ""99"" on Metacritic, with the lowest score being ""63."" When I saw this score my immediate reaction was that this film is no ""99."" It's a lot closer to that ""63,"" a score attributed to a review put out by Slant Magazine.",2016
2,I'm extremely lost as to why this movie has received so much praise. It was like watching a cake bake at 200 degrees and taking it out after 2 hours -- nothing to show for. Just a bunch of warm ingredients in a pan.,2017
1,"I watched this film for two hours. Two whole hours that are gone. Forever. The film takes place in Miami. It's about a young black boy who grows up gay in a tough neighborhood. That's it. Lots of sitting on the beach. Lots of talking that doesn't go ANYWHERE. Overall, the film followed a tired format that paints a pretty bland and shallow picture about life in the ""hood."" Stereotypical characterization of black women. I honestly couldn't tell you the point of this film or write a more a more comprehensive summary because it's a waste of time.",2017
3,"Reading other peoples' comments makes me a minority I believe, but there was just something that didn't win me over with Moonlight. Don't get me wrong, my favorite movie genre is drama and I really appreciate deep and artistically made coming-of-age dramas too, but I could barely contain my restlessness in these two hours. There was so little dialogue (and even if it was there, it didn't bear any importance) that it was difficult for me to get to know the characters, let alone like them or care for them. Although the plot may be relatable to some people, it just wasn't original. It felt like one clich√© was followed by another. ",2017
10,"To solely categorize this film as an examination of Chiron, a young  African American who has to deal with being gay is accurate but  inadequate. It wouldn't be inadequate to also categorize it as a movie  about drug abuse, school bullying, and isolation. However, if someone  were to ask me what MOONLIGHT is truly about I would say that, at it's  core, it's a film about teaching a child how to swim, feeling the sand  on your skin, and cooking a meal for an old friend.   Director Berry Jenkins is not afraid to be poetic, to guide his film  away from conventional storytelling and offer his audience something to  connect to in their own way. The way his camera roams around is  sensually magnificent; he knows when to cut to the next shot and when  to linger a few seconds longer. But above all else, his ability to add  an extra texture to each scene is awe-inspiring; it's more than just  style for the sake of style; it's essential to the movie's argument.  From the very first shot to the very last, MOONLIGHT is about as  beautiful a movie as you're likely to see this year. The colours are  rich and luminous; James Laxton's cinematography is visually immersive  leaving you stranded inside the story of the film. It moves at a  smooth, welcoming pace. The music, whether it be the classical or  hip-hop selections as well as Nicholas Britell's subtle score, is  perfect. And the performance are, well¬Ö they're the cherry on top.   It's uncanny how similar the 3 actors, who played the kid, teenage, and  adult versions of Chiron behaved and acted; you'd almost think it was  the same actor who played all three roles. Mahershala Ali and Naomie  Harris are more deserving of Oscar nominations than just about anyone  I've seen this year. They may be the standouts, but all the  performances, ranging from the children to the adults, are so raw and  powerful; a standing ovation for the casting director is in order.   But perhaps the thing about this movie that deserves the most acclaim  is its open-endedness; it's fight against straightforward  categorization and recap. MOONLIGHT so much more than a movie about  growing up gay; it's about overcoming your adversities and, despite  being a product of your environment, figuring out who you want to  become. Identity takes time to discover, and that's something anyone  can relate to.",2016
10,"When a film comes out and you know next to nothing about it with a director you don't know and a cast of mostly unknowns and it blows you away like it did me. Then I know I'm confronted by something unique. In fact it was director/writer Martin Donovan who wrote about Moonlight, urging all his actors to run and see it. Thank you sir. The faces of those three young men who are just one did something to my brain and to my heart. The best group of actors I've seen in one single film in a long, long time. The big surprise is that we knew it all along. It's all about love and what it means to be a man. Thank you Barry Jenkisns A revolutionary film made of truth and beauty.",2017
1,"Without a doubt this should be at the top of the most overrated movies of 2016. I cannot believe that I managed to stay awake during this trite story that goes absolutely nowhere. Not sure what message the director was trying to convey, but it utterly lost in the unbelievably slow pace and sleep inducing dialogue. Evidently this is supposed to be a story about a young, black man who is coming to terms with being gay in the gang/drug culture of Miami. Maybe that's a good story line, but it is impossible to relate to any of the characters due to the horribly boring writing. Definitely a movie to be missed. Borderline unwatchable and certainly not deserving of an Oscar nomination.",2017
1,"I bought a pass from our local theater to see all the Oscar nominated movies for best picture this week, right before the Oscars. Moonlight was my number 5, and I was really excited about seeing it. I had no idea what it was about, like the other movies I saw already (Hidden Figures, Hell or High Water, Arrival, Hacksaw Ridge so far). I really enjoyed the other four movies so far, so I was expecting a movie on the same par as these. This movie was so bad that I created an account on here just so I could leave a review and save others the agony of seeing this piece of garbage. It was the most pretentious thing I've seen, and worst movie I've ever seen (and I saw the first 3 seconds of Two Girls One Cup). I kept waiting for it to get good. 10 minutes, 20, 30, 60, 90?! And then boom, the movie was over with no plot (of which there was none) resolution to be seen. I really don't know what it was about. I cannot fathom why this thing was nominated for anything, except for a Razzie, and now I keep wondering if Asthon Kutcher is gonna show up at the Oscars and tell the director he was punk'd for being nominated. I hate to say it, but I think the only reason it was nominated and reviewed so highly by the powers that be, is because of white guilt, and that's the simple and plain truth. Hollywood is trying to avoid the mad black actors from last year (Hi Jada S.) that were mad at there being no people of color being nominated, so this pile of crap was given its affirmative action place with some other movies that were actually well made.",2017
4,"I was very excited to see this movie, but got very disappointed with what I saw. Despite the good performance of Naomi Harris, the move is very boring for me taste. The movie is very slow and way overrated. I really don't see the deal with the performance of Mr. Ali but maybe it's just me...",2017
1,"Everything you read about this one is a lie. It's not a masterpiece,  will not ""open your eyes"". What we have is a man-on-man love story  about a boy called Little who suspects he's ""different"" and is told so  (in no easy terms) by his classmates. When he slams one of these guys  in the head with a chair his life of crime begins, as he evolves into a  successful but lonely drug dealer (Sweet!). When he reconnects with the  guy who seduced him it becomes a happily-ever-after affair. As a Street  Drama the movie is lame. The makers of this film, and the reviewers,  are spineless deceivers. If they had the courage of their convictions  they'd be up-front concerning what the movie is about.",2016

9,"The reviewer's dilemma (and it is a dilemma reviewers LOVE to encounter) is, in a superb film with superb acting all around, a superb script, and superb directing, you still need to pay special attention to those actors that, in such a competitive environment, stand out as something ""extra"" special.",2017

And we do have to believe this is a nice ending? It tries to be a copycat from Boyhood and even more, from Truffaut series... This year Oscar's selection are really disappointing. Teresa and specially Blue are interesting characters and then suddenly we do not know anything else from them. Bullying in the school is so often, I suffered... buy we then wonder if he goes to a special school or what happened? Moved to Atlanta? why? when? Too many gaps. Last but not least, looks really weird that Chiron can be the same boy from 17 to the last chapter (Black). The three actors play very well but the idea of the director of not making them meet for me is wrong... too different. Solitude is a way specific feeling.",2017
4,"When Moonlight ended, a woman a few rows back said,""Is that it?"" That was exactly what I was thinking. This movie received so many excellent reviews from critics, and awards and nominations galore, that I assumed it must be quite good. Unfortunately, I do not agree with these critics or the various award giving entities in this case. I do not think it should have ever been nominated for best picture or best director. I give it a 4 out of ten. Moonlight is not entertaining, nor is it interesting. I can only guess that they thought it was politically correct to give a movie about a bullied,gay, black teen a good review because of all the controversy surrounding the Academy Awards supposed lack of ethnic diversity. I would nominate Denzel Washington's ""Fences"" instead.",2016
10,Moonlight is one of the most beautifully told stories of this decade. The camera work used in this film is like never before it has some of the best camera work since Children of Men. The film has a brilliant and beautiful way of using It's camera as a character. The cast is incredible every single one of them giving layered and beautiful performances there is not one bad or decent performance they're all fantastic. The three talented actors that play Chiron are all equally brilliant in their own ways playing the character of Chiron perfectly. Mahershala Ali as the drug dealer is possibly the best performance in the film he is perfect and Naomi Harris has a brilliant supporting role.,2016
1,"The 10 star reviews are shocking and Best Picture Oscar are shocking. I found the film tedious and dull. Nothing engaging or interesting to draw my attention away from the awful dialogue and predictable story arcs. Whilst I haven't seen any films about gay black men growing up in poverty, this film told me nothing about that struggle that I couldn't have written myself on the back of an envelope. If the academy felt compelled to give Best Picture to a film featuring actors of colour, both Hidden Figures and Lion were far more deserving.",2017
2,"Yes, it had good acting. Yes, it was technically well made. But there's no there there. For us it never achieved liftoff. It kept plodding on and on, nothing really wrong with it, but nothing to justify spending two hours on. In the end (and at the end) we were left wondering, why is the end now? Why not 30 minutes before or 30 minutes after? Possibly a good movie for film buffs/critics who are tired of the same old thing, but for the occasional movie goer, we can do better.",2017

I never saw separate restrooms and drinking fountains for ""colored"" but they were there. I never rode on segregated public buses, but they were there and I knew it. This movie, ""Hidden Figures,"" brings all of these worlds back to me. No, it's not a painstakingly accurate picture. NASA didn't have flat-panel screens back then. Communications between the ground and the Mercury capsules were not static-free. But a lot of this movie feels real. Very real.",2017

10,"Appreciation. It's a condition which requires information and understanding and results in increased compassion, acceptance and inclusiveness. There are few ways to enhance appreciation for others more effectively than a well-made movie and the 2016 historical drama ""Hidden Figures"" (PG, 2:07) takes full advantage of that opportunity. Without being too busy or too preachy, this film helps the audience better appreciate the struggles of being a minority ‚Äì and a working woman (and even a mother working outside the home) ‚Äì in the early 1960s, the pressure involved in competing with the Soviet Union in the early years of the space race, the difficult challenges surrounding getting man into space (and returning him safely to earth) for the first time and the courage it required of those who were willing to go. That's a lot for one movie ‚Äì and might be too much for many ‚Äì but ""Hidden Figures"" is up to the challenge.",2017
8,"I really enjoyed watching Hidden Figures. The story was compelling and laid out neatly for our viewing pleasure. It shone a spotlight on a part of history with which I wasn't familiar. And, most importantly, it made me want to learn more about Katherine Goble Johnson, Mary Jackson, and Dorothy Vaughan. What a shame the screenwriters felt they had to preach at me about racism rather than just tell the true story of these amazing and talented women. They weren't amazing and talented ""in spite"" of being black or ""in spite"" of being women, they were just amazing and talented in their own right. One day, perhaps, Hollywood will get a clue and give audiences credit for having a brain.",2017

Solid performances by all, some laugh-out-loud scenes, and some very emotional moments. It's also an important look back at the civil rights issues of the time period. The climax is a bit Apollo 13ish, and I'm fairly certain some scenes were embellished, but who cares. You should walk away from this film smiling, maybe even a bit choked up.",2017

4,"Easy on the eye but not worthy of the hype and the Oscar nomination. An interesting story has been directed in a very heavy handed way, which to me was constantly irritating. Almost every scene is overstated to the point that, as others have said, there is a propaganda feel to the film. Did the director really need to portray every white person, bar two, as vigorously racist or anti-women, even though virtually all the characters are clearly intelligent and from well educated backgrounds? This is a film where the message would have been stronger and more credible if a degree of balance and subtlety had been added to the mix. The things I enjoyed: some strong performances by a very capable cast, a very authentic period setting, a story which is totally engaging. The thing which turned me off: the exaggeration.",2017
7,"First I would like to say that I thought this was a tremendous movie. It is well written, acted, directed, and the story is amazingly compelling. Then I read a bit about the true story of these amazing women. There were such great liberties taken with their stories that I was a bit appalled. While it did a great job making us feel just how amazing these women were it failed to show the role NASA played correctly. I will simply paste the wiki of the reality of the mindset of NASA as well as the real story, in a super condensed way. Science is anti-stupidity and racism is stupid. I wish that NASA and science had been presented in a bit better light. Paste starts here:",2017
2,"Hidden Figures tells the story of three African American women in the late sixties as they become instrumental to NASA in putting John Glen on the moon. Directed by Theodore Melfi and stars Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, Kevin Costner and Kirstin Dunst, Hidden Figures would be a good film had it not been so concerned with the idea of the empowerment of women that it forgot to be a good, engaging film. It has the proper ingredients to become a heavy hitter but trades it in using its excellent cast as more of a political statement than anything else.",2016

1,"Let's be frank here. They could have made the three black, female leads read out the telephone listings for two hours and this hokum would have been nominated for an Oscar. It is extremely clich√©d, agenda-driven, pedestrian twoddle. The movie's devoid of any feeling with its filmsy, cookie-cutter characters and hackneyed, tedious plot. It's just a typical throwaway blockbuster splurged out by Hollywood without any creative thought applied. There's no humour, excitement, originality, nothing, nada. It reminded me of last year's similarly banal Oscar nomination Bridge of Spies, in that it should be nowhere near any awards, but it is far worse. ",2017
1,"First off, my aunt worked at 'The Cape' during this time and never heard of this. She was working in the same section as these ladies supposedly were working. Now, lots of personnel were in flux during this time and she may have missed them, but people talk and no one ever talked to her about an entire group of black ladies calculating launch/orbital dynamics. In the south, this would have been a major story even in the sixties. This is a great movie as movies go, but it was hard for me to enjoy it while sifting through all the overt political statements. I saw where the movie only made around half a million dollars on opening weekend. Also, I read reports of actresses buying out an entire theater's showing of this movie. So, that explains the obscene total gross of the movie. I'm sure special interest groups bought out theaters to pad the numbers as well. The idea that our brave astronauts were nothing more than space monkeys taking a ride on the backs of black, female mathematicians is insulting to both parties. They had scratch paper and slide rules in the 60's and every engineer had them. Showing someone climb a ladder to calculate trajectories on a blackboard is theatrical, but adds questions to the credibility of this story. Henderson's performance IS Oscar worthy--and I love Olivia Spencer. I am just worried that more and more of our nation's history will be revised to give MORE credit than where credit was actually due. One thing that truly bothers me: this movie was released AFTER most of the people involved with this stage of the space program were deceased. So, there is no way to ASK anyone if this is factually correct. Also, I'm sure this will be required viewing at schools during black history month.",2017

Why this has not been known for many, many years - that is a sad state. Thank heaven the daughter wrote the book and these women will have the credit they so deserved. A good showing of the discrimination shown the black people in the 60's - it was well represented but the story took front page. I love these women - they were mothers, wives and eventually recognized as experts in their field of math and coding. I grew up in the late 50 and 60's - so impressive that the three did not let anything hold them back. They did it quietly and with respected results - but this story should have been told in the 60's. The acting is excellent, the sets are so believable, the culture is there - thank you Theodore Malfi for a an entertaining and educational film. And Pharrell for the music.",2017

But what started to grate, and then to annoy, was the fact that not a single other character contributed a single thing. Although it was sometimes talked about, no character apart from the main two actually do any math, or any programming. The 'Big Bag Theory' guy complained some. I think Kevin Costner held a piece of chalk a couple of times, but he spent most of the time telling us how awesome the main character was. Whilst the height of realism is not required, the hard focus on the main character suggested almost that she was doing ALL the work herself, which made the whole thing look weak and unconvincing.",2017

3,"This movie scared the living daylights out of my 3 and 4 year old. The content was not really funny (It had a couple of spots but they were few and far between).

(Remember Jody Foster getting semen thrown at her) My children cried and we left the theater when the (spoiler alert, near the end) . The movie should be rated PG13 as the themes were more suited to teenagers who could handle aggressive animals, mob mentality of killing someone, New York style hardcore sarcasm where no one cares about anyone, and Meth lab where an insane looking sheep in an DU HAST video with air breather is making ""night howler"" I am a guy that has seen his fair share of freaky, and I love a good movie (going for Apocalypse Now tonight) BUT this show is not for kids, and I am aghast that Disney put it out. I remember enjoying the time of Toy Story, Nemo, Hero 6, Wall-e, Up and great Disney Movies (Shrek, Shark Tale, Madagascar from the ""other guys"") This movie was to deep in subject matter and the message was for teenagers and not little children.",2016

Rabbit jumps, fox is sly, lion mayor, wolf in sheep's clothing, otter is a predator (the predators are bulky and this is a cutie???), sloth is slow. This year children will learn so much about animals adding zyuohger and kung fu panda and what else?

I do not want to spoil this movie because, unless you have already seen it, I would say its worth seeing. This movie really changed my perspective on Disney. The film had my attention the entire time, I was never bored at any part. In fact, I was so caught into this movie, that when I went to set down my drink, I missed the cup-holder and dropped it! It did not spill but anyway, not to get off topic, it was an overall great film. This is one of the few movies that will receive a 10/10 rating. I was impressed, would recommend to anyone, not just kids. So, in conclusion, one of the best Disney movies I have ever seen, would watch again.",2016

As such, its effect is similar to that of the person talking politics at the cocktail party who relies on volume rather than substance in order to bolster their (or more accurately their party's) talking points.",2016

With multiple ecosystems and a plethora of cultural subsets ‚Äì mirroring our own society wouldn't you know ‚Äì the anthropomorphic animal-world is conceptually interesting and beautifully animated, but the story told within this universe is disappointingly dull. The simple predators-and-prey-living-together plot device should've been ripe for subtle metaphors amongst zippy action and constant laughs, yet the film's themes ‚Äì breaking down stereotypes, looking past race, being inclusive ‚Äì are hammered home so heavy-handedly it feels like you're getting in trouble. A major issue is the lack of humour (or more accurately: successful humour) which, save for a truly hilarious sloth-centred sequence that had me in tears, is woefully misjudged and/or drowned out by the persistence of shoving a point down our throat. The muddled tone makes for a confusing viewing too; the unapologetic innocent nature of proceedings suggests this is aimed squarely at the toddler demographic, yet the Godfather and 'Breaking Bad' references are directly at odds with this. The infectiously optimistic bunny at the movie's heart, Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin), is a sweet and likable protagonist, however the mischievous fox who partners with Hopps, Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), has more depth and charisma. A lower-rung Disney effort with a gratingly obvious agenda, Zootopia hints at brilliance but frustratingly falls way short.",2016

Denis knows how to capture the tension. It is almost the strongest point of all of his films. Minimal use of computer generated images, and main focus on story, characters, acting and thrilling scenes. Back on IMDb board, I have noticed a lot of people calling Arrival a boring movie. So many hypocrites these days. People trying to point out every possible flaw to look and sound smarter while at the same time hailing far worse movies. Calling it boring and slow while at the same time complaining no originality in Hollywood, only giant CGI laser explosions extravaganza. Go watch Independence Day. In Arrival there is no action, no explosions, just some amazing acting performances combined with good directing, editing and cinematography. There was not a single moment I felt bored.",2017

It shed a new light on the beauty of life and how if perceived non-linearly life and death can be the same. The movie itself is sheer brilliance. The pacing, the cinematography, the music (MY GOD THE MUSIC)...the direction...and Amy Adams. My god she deserves all the praise she's been getting. Her grief is palpable. While watching her ""dream"" in Heptapod dreams its as though she's in my mind, thinking of the little things and memories of my daughter that I'll cherish forever.

Louise's skills make her a requirement for the U.S forces, who recruit her - and mathematician Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) - to attempt to decode and translate the language that the creatures inside the spacecrafts are using in order to prevent a global war. Alien invasion films have, frankly, been done to death. Arrival's script - penned by Eric Heisserer and adapted from Ted Chiang's short story ""Story of Your Life"" - is ingenious in that it finds an entirely new angle to focus the whole thing on. Rather than start a war and depict the bloodshed and trauma of an alien invasion, Arrival focuses on the struggle to communicate with the creatures (dubbed ""Heptapods""), and what the aftermath of this could lead to should it not go to plan. The whole thing is pieced together like a piece of art - the performances, dialogue, cinematography, soundtrack, screenplay, editing and direction all form one elegantly structured whole. It's a simply astonishing feat of film making.",2016

Oh, and the space craft - truly pathetic. Honestly, 1960's science fiction films are just as well done with better story lines, more suspenseful and eminently more watchable. The story was laborious, uninteresting and overly complicated. This was a film that so desperately needed kick starting but it's engine just would not fire up. I was looking forward to seeing this movie, the hype pre-launch offered such promise but what a deception that was.

4,"(spoilers) ""Arrival"", directed by Denis Villenueve is a one-trick pony Sci-fi movie that wears thin about midway through its long feeling runtime. Perhaps the story from Ted Chiang was better done, but here in the movie we are put through some linguistics philosophy and a quasi time loop dream sequence. It feels like smoke and mirrors because it is. The explanations are dream-like imagery, and the meaning or motivation is lost. There's of course clich√©d string orchestra as usual blaring (at least better than singing). The revelation that Adams character saves humanity by phoning a Chinese general is anti- climatic, hand-waving and ludicrous. The supposed tension is set by big-bad China. Yes, it used to be the Soviet Union as the big bad villain country for filmmakers, and in ""Arrival"" its China. This is a shameless ""I need a sufficient villain"" to manufacture tension. Also poorly thrown is film-makers need to show news feeds as sort of validation of reality, as if media is the social hand that feeds. ""Arrival"" has an interesting setup and reveal of Alien Life forms, but the writing/script seems to be too smart for its own good. The last 1/3 of the movie is a complete mess. Sorry the child died, move on - blah. I've read it being compared to ""Contact"" and ""Midnight Special"", both of which are hands down better movies. Cannot recommend 4/10.",2016

Louise, the linguist, is plagued by (what we think) are memories of her beautiful daughter who died of cancer. She seems to be carrying this huge grief. Then, about 90 minutes in she says ""Who is this child?"" The aliens solve the mystery. They tell her she can see the future: the child is the one she is GOING to have with Jeremy Renner. And he is going to leave her when he finds out she knew that their child would die but chose to have the child anyway. The big ""Sixth Sense"" surprise is that they were not memories, they were premonitions. So, are we to believe that Louise could see that she was going to have a child that would die but couldn't predict an ALIEN INVASION? And how did she know the last words of the General's wife. Did she also become psychic? The movie isn't about aliens at all, it's about what you would do if you could see the future. By the way, if she could see the future, does that mean she could not choose NOT to have the baby. And if the aliens can see the future, how did they not know about the explosives planted in their ship. The whole movie is a pretentious and utterly confused piece of garbage.",2017

It reminds me a bit of Assassin's creed III which is also awesome. So yeah...I hope they won't leave it with just 1 season....but knowing the popularity of those kinds of shows, out of the mainstream- I won't be surprised if Frontier follows the fate of other great canceled historical dramas as The Borgias, Copper, Da Vinci's Demons, etc. Best of luck!",2017

The movie had a lot crazy-packed action (it was directed by Zack Snyder, what do ya expect?) but the plot didn't know where it was going. A lot of scenes were a treat for me to see and I got goosebumps watching them. There was more to Jesse Eisenberg than what I saw (and hated, like most people) in the trailer. I made a bet to my friend that he'll suck in the movie, guess I'll have to pay up. He really WAS good. But just like any other movie, it's not perfect and has flaws. You can see that Zack tried hard very hard to fit everything nicely into the movie, but over stuffing was bound to happen.

Ben Affleck does a GREAT job as Batman, that doesn't mean I LOVED this Batman (I did not) but he does a great job and any problems there are with the character fall on the writer, producers and director. The problem with this Batman is no that he is brutish and violent and angry.. it's that he's not smart. He's not strategic and intellectual , brilliant and a world class detective.

There are a lot of Zack Snyder fan boys worshiping this lackluster filmmaker of limited talent, and that's unfortunate. It's a monumental shame WB gave him the keys to any comic book hero film franchise at all, and I'm someone who actually thought ""Watchmen"" wasn't all that bad. People still love the characters of Batman, Superman, and Wonderwoman, but with that said, this is a movie that could have done close to Star Wars box office numbers. Instead, under the seriously flawed incompetent direction of a hack like Snyder, we got this mess. Even Michael Bay could have given the source material a desperately needed morsel of levity. All creative control should have been removed from Snyder, and this should have been a stand alone film under the direction of a much more talented and skilled filmmaker rebooting both Batman and Superman. That was yet another giant mistake by WB. This should never have been a followup to the much maligned and critically panned, ""Man of Steel"". In an effort to ""nolanize"" Superman, they allowed an inferior filmmaker compared to Christopher Nolan go completely off the rails with such a disconnected total misinterpretation of the Superman character to the extreme that it wasn't Superman. It would have made sense to have this be a followup if ""Man of Steel"" had been well-received like ""Batman Begins"". As the saying goes, fool me once WB shame on you. We were all fools to give them a second chance and pay money to see this poor excuse for what should have been an amazing film. The first two hours were a spectacular utter bore with subplots that were neither interesting enough to care about nor necessary. The character of Lex Luthor is an extremely intelligent criminal mastermind, not a socially awkward schizophrenic played by the miscast Jesse Eisenberg. The worst offense of this film is how Superman is killed off by an ill conceived CGI blob that was supposed to be Doomsday. Jimmy Olsen is shot and killed in the monotonous first half of the film in a scene that doesn't even identify who he is. He just appears out of nowhere. Holly Hunter's character is killed off. Laurence Fishburne's scenes could have been completely cut out. They added nothing to the story. If Snyder claims he actually does have reverence for these characters, I wouldn't want to see what he does with characters he doesn't. In fact, I don't want to see what he does with any other comic book character ever. Marvel will continue to dominate with their films over DC until massive changes are made. It's not rocket science. Like may other people who saw this film, I won't be paying to see ""Justice League"" as long as Hack Snyder and David Goyer have anything to do with it.",2016
1,"I don't get the movie at all. There is no clear story line. The whole movie is just a collage of unconnected scenes and fighting scenes. This movie exist only to show batman, superman and wonder woman in the same movie. Scenes often get confusing, one moment you are in Africa, the next scene you were elsewhere for no apparent reason and has no connection what so ever with the previous scene. First of all, what exactly warranted batman to go against superman, the whole reasons like visions, dreams etc doesn't seem to justify batman to want to kill superman. The story line is too forceful without realistic reasons to back it up. Whats the meaning for lex luthor to have those researches about people with seemingly super power. Another thing, if the kryptonite supposed to be that important why the hell did batman just left it without a second thought and why did batman stop his intention and all of a sudden decided to help superman just because superman said the word ""martha"". In the final battle against the made up common enemy, how did lois lane knew that they needed to find the kryptonite that batman left and suddenly just sprang to find it. Why was lex luthor arrested in the end? Since the only people who knew about his intentions are batman and superman. How did the government decided to arrest him and on what grounds? In conclusion, this movie is a 2.5 hrs long pile of mess.",2016
5,"I am drawn back to when this movie was first announced and how I despised the notion of a Batman V Superman film a la Freddy vs Jason, Alien vs Predator and so on. It all seemed like a huge gimmick to me and I expected the worst for this movie. Fast forward a couple years, I am sitting down at a private screening, the lights go down and the movies opens up. The opening sequence was not what I expected but shows Snyder's visual creativity in a similar manner as he did with the opening sequence of Watchmen. ",2016
2,A Batman who behaves likes a hissy teenage girl taking the fight to Superman because there's 'a 1% chance he will destroy earth' when he was shown up to be of not much use when a nuclear warhead was fired or when Doomsday was totaling the city; a Batman who was all set to write his legacy by killing Superman (who doesn't know for a fact if Aquaman and the lot are friend or foe) only to become his friend just like that even saying cringe worthy lines like 'Martha will not die tonight' and the even worse 'I will not fail him in death'...,2016
1,"This is, hands down, the worst piece of entertainment i have seen in my life! Forget about coherence, forget about story, forget about humor, you find non in this junkyard. Batman vs Superman is about two wannabe bodybuilders who try to build up a heated and involuntarily gay atmosphere in 2.5 hours only to fight for 4 min with CGI rubble flying around. It is Brokeback Mountain meets Crossfitt commercial. Poor Ben Afleck never looked dumber! I am trying hard to find anything positive with this movie but it is really really hard. download this masterpiece,see 5 min and turn it off. Go do something nice with your buck! P.s. Avengers was crappy in its own right but this one takes the word to a new height!",2016
10,"Affleck as Bruce Wayne/Batman was pure awesome and dark. You can see he's¬†traumatized by the events in the past, and he has some fantastic lines in general (Yes we see the whole parents thing again). Nobody should really be surprised that he was good with¬†the role considering he's a solid actor, but I thought he was great. Versus Bale? That's a interesting question, because Affleck¬†definitely regards Batman as a permanent part of his persona, while in Nolan series he eventually doesn't want Batman. In combat he's pretty much everything everyone would hope for from a film with Batman. One comment on the latest BvS trailer said he fought like the Arkham video games from a¬†scene they showed. That's a good¬†comparison. He's incredible in fights. Also the way Snyder records him in action, you can actually see him fighting unlike the Nolan films, which I'd imagine would make many people happy. He also¬†gets a chance to use his detective skills, do not worry. Also his relationship with Irons, who plays Alfred,¬†is just wonderful in general. Irons was exceptional¬†in the role¬†(Its Jeremy Irons for Christ's sake, of course he nailed the role) gets some witty lines and also gets pretty emotional later on. He didn't get a lot of screen time, just enough to be effective. Always passing advice to Batman.",2016
1,"I thought I had seen it all when it came to bad comic book movies -  from the clumsiness of the Sam Raimi ""Spiderman"" films to the raging  dumpster fire that is ""Batman & Robin"". Then I saw ""Batman v Superman:  Dawn of Justice"" and got a rude awakening: I had no idea just how bad a  movie in the caped avenger genre could be. I didn't know a movie of any  kind could be this bad.   Everything about ""Batman v. Superman"" is awful. The story is so busy  and overstuffed with characters that, in the end, it's hard to remember  what it's about. The fight scenes are bloody and loud without being  exciting, mistaking violence and noise for thrills. Worst of all, it's  no fun; there's not one single moment of excitement or adventure in two  and a half very long hours. I walked out of the theater dazed and  upset, as if I had just been mugged. This movie actually ruined my  night.  The plot is almost impossible to follow, let alone recap, but I'll try.  Batman (Ben Affleck) and Superman (Henry Cavill) become enemies for  reasons that are never clear. They reluctantly join forces after Lex  Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) unleashes a Kryptonite monster and threatens  to kill Lois Lane (Amy Adams) if the two heroes don't fight each other,  which will help him take over Gotham City... or something. And then  Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) shows up out of nowhere for a loud, bloody and  utterly pointless climactic battle.  Yes, this movie is confusing. Very confusing. But that's not even its  biggest problem. The worst thing about this movie is that it's no fun  at all. The pace is leaden, the ""realism"" is just boring - there's a  scene with a Senate hearing on C-Span, for God's sake - and the  characters look perfectly miserable to be there. Who could blame them?  I have never seen comic book characters enjoy themselves less. Affleck  and Cavill treat being a superhero as if it's a burden, not an  adventure; they frown, grimace and speak with long, tortured pauses, as  if they are playing the lead in a high school theater production of  ""Hamlet"". Adams and Gadot aren't given a whole lot to do, but while  they're doing it they manage to look as if they're waiting in line at  the DMV. Even Eisenberg's giggly, hyperactive Lex Luthor smacks of  desperation; he mugs for the camera like an ignored middle child acting  out to get attention.  A comic book movie without fun is the definition of failure. Comic  books are not Greek tragedy. They are stories designed for children,  and children at heart. It's in vogue these days to make ""dark and  gritty"" superhero movies, and it can be done well, as in Christopher  Nolan's ""Dark Knight"" trilogy. But those movies worked because they  balanced darkness with excitement, grit with joy. They had the kind of  magic that lets the 10-year-olds who live within even the most hardened  adults out to play.   There is no joy in ""Batman vs Superman"". It doesn't know what magic is.  It's the only superhero movie I've ever seen that made me sad.",2016
8,"I didn't see the film in the theaters and just bought the ""Extended Edition "" on Amazon. I never properly saw Man of Steel- i think I rented it and watched it when already exhausted and fell asleep. I saw the mediocre user reviews and horrible reviews from critics of this film.",2016
1,"After reading all the negatives reviews, I still went to watch (in 3D!) this superhero battle thinking it may not be the critics' film but at least it would be some spectacular mess offering some guilty superhero fun.

1,"Worst movie ever made, by far. There is nothing, or hardly anything that makes much of any sense, scenes follow each other without there being any way of linking them together and little to no consistency.

I never saw Man of Steel, I never saw Superman Returns, I never saw The Quest for Peace (thankfully), but I know enough about Superman's backstory to get a feel for the character. I absolutely love Batman, I've seen all of the 80/90s film and I love them all, with one obvious exception. After seeing a pretty impressive trailer for the film, I decided to head up to the local cinema to see the latest work of DC Comics, I really wish I hadn't bothered.",2016

1,"I wanted to love this movie, it had potential to be a great superhero film but it was pretty God awful. The plot was confusing, the cgi was bad, Doomsday appeared WAY TOO EARLY and Superman DIES in his second appearance. And the casting was bad. I mean Jesse Einsberg as Lex Luther? The good things about this was the acting, it was pretty well. Wonder Woman was also AWESOME but overall this is a very poor movie. Save your money for Captain America Civil War instead because it will unfortunately be a lot better than this.",2016

9,"I ran across this title over the internet and thought it was a movie. I then saw it was a TBS original and had second thoughts about watching it. (I live outside the US and don't have TBS.) I reluctantly watched the pilot episode and trust me when I tell you this, if you have any sense of humor, you will love this show. ",2016
10,"I gave it ten because I found it so refreshing. If one has tried to watch most of the other new comedies that have come out recently like ""Kevin can wait"" and ""Man with a Plan"" and find them mostly unwatchable you may agree. The Detour may be pretty stupid sometimes but at least it's funny. I mean really funny. I watched the entire first season in a short period of time and I am ready for more. It is a bit raunchy at times so if you are sensitive to raunchiness just change the channel. I found something ""laugh out loud"" funny in every episode. Usually many times per episode. Natalie Zea is great in this. Normally she just gets a couple of lines in a show but here she is a main character, so you get to see her a lot. Not appropriate for your Mom or your kids so enjoy!",2017
8,OK so I usually don't go for the rude crude and dirty humor like this show is however i was pleasantly surprised here its a good comedy ABOUT FAMILY NOT FOR FAMILY its filthy to the core and if u are easily offended stay far far away from this show but I think its hilarious so far I love the kids and the parents alike none of them are really role model citizens but they all have their own special thing about them that u love the daughters hilarious better than u attitude the sons weirdness the moms hornyness the dads sweet attempts it all works together perfectly and it all fits great tbs knows a little about comedy and this proved it ps love full fruntle with Sam bee as well but I say if u are mature enough to take some sexual jokes and swearing I say give it a shot u will at least laugh once guaranteed,2016

8,"Now on TBS a new series called ""The Detour"" has begun and I watched the first episode I can see it's gonna be one funny series with some slapstick and drama as this family gets in troubles that you wouldn't expect still you as the viewer kind of see it coming! The plot centers around a married couple and their two little kids a boy and a girl who take their ford van along on a journey from the interstate at their home in New York with the trip destination being Florida and you guessed it along the way their journey is derailed! And along the way the family meets some wild and crazy characters as it's a journey on the yellow brick road of hell! The series is blended with wit and funny one liners and it even has some dirty sex appeal moments so it may not be everyone's cup of tea maybe some family members may skip it! Overall still the series is downright fun as in life on your trips they are unexpected and often you meet people you don't expect as it can be wild and downright crazy fun!",2016
9,"I stumbled across this show, and I'm so glad! It's hilarious! There is an over-arcing plot in the police station at the beginning of each episode (which is the only part I'm not 100% happy with, I'm not sure where they're going with it or how it adds to the shows development), but each episode is really funny overall.",2017
8,I have to say that I am not usually amused by raunchy humor and swearing however the show is just so funny and sweet that I really can't resist it now don't get me wrong I was offended by it and even had to turn away from some jokes however it is hilarious and I have to recommend that you watch it sorry if the show offends you but I found it hilarious the whole family is great the kids are always getting into trouble in the most funniest ways and the father is screwing up the trip every time he tries to help but he is such a great little guy who is determined that he will give his family and wife a fun time on . vacation. If you can handle the situations and language then this might just be the show for you just please KEEP AWAY FROM CHILDREN,2016
9,"This is great cartoon fun with live people. Have been a fan of Jason Jones who I know has good comedy chops. And also a fan of Natalie Zea who I had no idea she was this good at comedic acting, having seen her only in serious roles. Sam Bee is wife to Jason Jones and we know how great she is but she's also creator and producer and along with hubby writer of this show. Jason and Natalie have great chemistry (and I wonder how Ms Bee is dealing with that.) In any case the two kids are pretty funny and cute--not in a cutesy way. The situations can be ridiculous, absurd, outrageous and sometimes serious. But I look forward to it each week and even suffer the commercials which is a rarity for me. Give it a shot. It's only a half hour.",2017
7,"The first season was grate and had lots of energy and know where it was going. but the second season I was lost, the first half is sad and depressing and the second half fills long and the story goes everywhere, it fills they are making the story up as it goes on. Why did they make the husband randomly go's from smart,funny and likable to a stupid joke and unknowing person and why douse the daughter go from clever in the first season to being weird and stupid in the second season. I hope that they make season 3 more like season 1 and not 2.",2017

7,"Exactly my kind of crazy. The jokes are not of the freshest kind and the story may not be as original, but it's quite enjoyable. I don't find my eyes drifting away from the screen. I like Zea and her ability to play hysterical characters and I think Jason Jones is genuinely funny. I'm not familiar with his work at all, but in this he nails it, in my opinion. ",2017
7,"For most, this series seems to be a hit or miss. Personally, I think the show is a decent comedy. Is it the funniest show you've ever seen, not by far! There are no ""jokes"" in this series, it's the situations they find themselves in and how they react that is funny. Of course they don't act realistically, the show isn't based on reality, it's a comedy. So if you are one of those super serious people that are going to pick at every detail, this is not for you, nor are you the target audience. ",2017
1,"This show has both parents and children that are mostly cartoon characters, which are hard not to find annoying to say the least. The script seems to have been written by someone who lives in their parents basement and only watches National Lampoon Vacation movies and has a very low I.Q.

1,"I expect the first episode to set the tone for the whole show. If that's reasonable, I think this show is gonna suck. Which is unfortunate because I liked Jason Jones on the Daily Show. ",2016
9,I have been watching this show off and on for the past three seasons and I must say while I haven't seen this as very family friendly it was sure as hell a lot of enjoyment I have sometimes laughed so hard I almost cried the kids are hilarious together and the adults are fun too as long as you can take mature sexual humor and swearing you should have a tremendous time with the parkers just remember this a show about family and its damn sure not for family just keep this in mind when watching,2017
2,"I fell in love during the first season. Great cast and concept. Couldn't wait for season two but after watching a few episodes the thrill was gone. What was funny the first season now seems forced and repetitive. We get it but they are trying way too hard to gross us out. It fails and the story suffers. I don't have an issue with the swearing nor am I grossed out by the weekly blood and guts bit. The stuff they are doing serves no purpose beyond ""look what we can do"" and get away with. What was originally fresh and pushed the boundaries is now stale and a bore. As much as I love the cast, regrettably I am out for future seasons. What a shame.",2017
6,How can a show so creative and hilarious in the first season fly so high and then in the 2nd season make a complete crash landing? I do not know! One thing I'm sure of (in my opinion) the actors seemed bored with the script and plot so the producers and director threw in crazy physical antics to distract the viewer from a sinking show.,2017
9,"I absolutely love this show, I just wish Jason Jones and Samantha Bee had visited Syracuse before setting part of the show in Syracuse. As always, Syracuse is not portrayed accurately, which is why it is only a 9. Other than that the show is amazing and one of the few shows I watch the same night it airs.",2017
3,"Two of the most idiotic parents (but still among the smartest characters in the show) take their far smarter progeny on a road trip where all the lies of there marriage come to light and where the trust the most important things to the absolutely least trust-able characters the mind of scriptwriter can conceive and what happens is the most predictable slapstick you could ever imagine. I'm sure I would love it - if I were twelve. No vomit or diarrhea yet but you can bet it's coming. Disappointing, but I love Natalie Zea in everything she does, well everything but this. Seriously, I think anyone could write this shtick. Just take any of your favorite characters, put them on a road trip and have them make the worst possible decision in every case. Viola! It's comedy gold!",2016
10,I watched the premier of the new season of the show last night and I am kind of on the fence about how this season is going to go it had its moments don't get me wrong but it seemed like something is missing from the show I will continue to watch it cause it was a good time and it felt great to have the family back again bigger and better than before I still love the kids and the mother the dads still a goof which is refreshing to see however the constant joke about cheating spouses in the second episode kinda bugged me it was like there were no consequences for either the mother or father who clearly went out on each other.though they did both bump into each other in the process of cheating which was kinda funny but it kinda made light of a serious problem with relationships now days and I didn't like that but aside from that it was a good time and super fun just please KEEP THE KIDS AWAY FROM THE SHOW it's just that simple not for kids but fun and enjoyable and hilarious for adults,2017
3,"Pilots can be deceiving. Sometimes the authors want to do too much, and as a result the show tends to be over the top, frantic and so on. That's why I'm generally willing to give it at least a second chance. Generally, but not this time. I don't see how this sitcom could improve to reach at least the passing grade. I'm not fastidious when it comes to sitcoms, if I can laugh a few times during the 20 minutes time I'm satisfied, unfortunately this was not the case. Let's see then...yes there is bad language, but that doesn't put me off, it's not funny in itself though if not well orchestrated with the other elements of the situations. The idea of a politically incorrect family was good (remember ""Stll Standing""?) and a couple of twists in this first episode were promising but the result simply doesn't work. It's difficult to point the finger... writers, director perhaps, certainly not the actors who do their job, I see Natalie Zea always with pleasure, still...Sexually charged dialogues involving children can be hilarious (""Two and a Half Men""), it's just not the case here.",2016

9,"The Path is an excellent rendering of a contemporary cult and the machinations, lies, delusions and outright corruption engaged upon to ensure its survival. If one studies cults and how they lure in followers, and how they manipulate them into buying into their ideas and eventually losing touch with their own sense of reality, self determinism and free-will, the Path brings all of that out into the open. Sometimes it is actually painful to watch if you have ever known someone, especially someone close to you, who has been caught in the maws of a cult. Moreover, the producers did a great job of showing just how such a cult as The Path, can hide behind the mantle of religiosity, and using peer pressure, and more importantly, peer-mentality, cover up all manner of abuses, violations of human rights and corruption. Although the characters, in some cases, appear to be extreme, it can only be said that until one has experienced the reality of life inside the inner sanctum of a cult, that it is hard to believe that people can become, literally, another person altogether once they have turned over their loyalty to the cult. Normal people become abnormal. Kids disconnect from their families and loved ones. And social personalities become toxic - all in the name of the pursuit of spirituality. The contradictions are well played in this series. Definitely worth watching.",2017
9,"This show is great. If you just don't think of it from a religious stand point, you'll get it. Seems to be about people with moral and unmoral things that cause conflictions, major burdens, community issues, unsolved emotions and those who are insecure wanting something more to believe in more than anything. Gave it a 9, maybe would be an 10, if new episodes wouldn't show previous situations that was not envovled in last episodes. Showing new unseen footage at the beginning of new episodes as if we saw them in details previously makes for confusion. Can't wait to see what happens with Eddie in the near future. Great characters, great acting, great script and a sort of slow burner with cliffhangers. Probably better as binge worthy if impatient.",2017
10,"This show is fantastic for anyone who like a tense slow burn character piece. There are definitely huge moments here, but they a few and far. This is a series best enjoyed as a whole. All of the main characters have huge, impactful arcs, that have them completely evolve by the time the credits roll on the finale. Beyond that it is a wonderful musing on religion, spirituality, and family. Definitely a must watch if you are a fan of slow but rewarding drama. I've seen a lot of reviews where the critic has given up after the first episode. All reiterate, this is a slow burn that needs to be experienced in full. Each episode carefully expands and twists on the last. The first episode serves to put all of the pieces into place, instead of lighting an explosion to draw you in. After 3 episodes I couldn't stop watching and now, I'm counting the days until it returns for season 2.",2016

9,"""The Path"" will appeal to anybody who has ever attempted to start their own religious or spiritual path, which indirectly involves every person in some way or another. The acting is fantastic. Aaron Paul & Michelle Monaghan are always very good, so no real surprise there. But they also co-produced this, & I think they did outstanding work. The show is one of those with very complex characters, real life people who you can identify with their pain & struggles. The star though is Hugh Dancy who plays Cal, the leader of ""Meyerism."" I've never seen him before, but he totally kills it and steals the show. I would give him an Oscar for best actor, hands down. Bravo Hugh!",2017
8,"I liked this show from the start because it's different from most TV fare and the acting is superb, especially Hugh Dancy as Cal. Now it's really growing on me as the hidden secrets of the cult leaders and followers start to slowly come out and the clash with the outside world becomes inevitable. Although some of the contextual scenes are over the top and do kind of spoil things sometimes, it's a small thing to complain about and the overall production values are great.",2016
7,"As a couple who got out of a cult like scenario ourselves, my husband and I like certain aspects of this show and dislike others. Having been in a similar situation with a ""religion"", we relate to the two main characters a lot. However, there's various details about the show that irritate us on a logical level. Certain decisions characters make simply don't make sense at times if we are to believe they really are/were super into ""the movement"". Certain scenes don't make sense with the flow of the show too (especially a few of the random sex scenes in random places - and that's coming from people who are not offended by sex scenes, these ones just happened to be very weird in terms of placement in the show). Overall, the various plot lines and characters are gripping enough to carry the show and hold your attention, flaws and all. I see this as a mid to high 6 when compared to other shows we enjoy and rounded it up. We did get sucked in enough to finish season one and will watch season two when it comes out.",2016
9,"I find that the plot and characters are well written. Based on an interview I read online by the writer, I know have a strong understanding as to why the story has a good plot. I like that the story starts light and at first glance you will be like, OK these nice people are all living together like a hippie community, nothing wrong with that. Then the next move is watching the main character Eddie, doubt the path and slowly but surely figuring out that he is not part of a movement but rather cult. The whole story is slow but intense. I like that the series is taking it's time to show different members and how the cult function. If you are into cults and religions you will like this TV series. I would like to find another TV series like this one. It kind of reminds me of Wayward pines but less spooky and you know what is going on from the start.",2016
5,"Life in the cult is organic, harmonic, healthy, self-contained, and rational. The women wear simple cotton clothes, sensible footwear, and no makeup; the men are supportive.

3,"I tried. I was somewhat interested after the first episode but this pretty quickly slipped into melodrama, heavy breathing, teenage angst and over scoring. None of the leads are engaging nor well cast. Monohan looks constantly confused or swooned, Aaron befuddled and apologetic and the other dude is too shrimpy to pass as the tough guy he is meant to be. BTW who nips a full joint and tosses it out the window. If I had to see one more white picket fence shot... I get it - it is the American Dream distorted. Whack me on the head with the image just once more. Need some filler - throw in another soft core sex scene. It all has that been there seen it feel. If I'm bored after two I'm not continuing down this path... Get it I used path in my review like in the title of the show.

1,"I was in the middle with my opinions on the show. I liked the actors and the direction of the show, but in ep7 it all fell apart for me. The writers and director of the show took a direction which was too early in character development. Cult leaders have a history of being charismatic and creepy at the same time. The character, Cal Roberts, is supposed to be a quasi-cult leader who is working up the ""rungs"" of the ladder. However they don't make him in to this charismatic, creepy guy. He doesn't hold me in the show as being a person who I would want to follow. He doesn't have it. In fact, ep7 is where I completely lost faith in the writers and director.",2016
6,"I guess I just ""want to believe"" in this new cult themed series but after just watching the pilot episode I can't say that I was overly impressed.

Eddie has just returned from a religious retreat from Peru where their church leader is in the process of climbing the last three rungs of the church leader's self-appointed storybook Meiyerism church ladder.",2016

The cast is great too and play their parts well. It really does show a different lifestyle and keeps you interested from start to finish.",2018
7,"The Path, is definitely worth sometime, and... if you're willing to grant forgiveness for it's flaws. There's a roughness to the characters, some mark missing climactic points, and an unusual amount of sex for the pace and content of the show. Is The Path to the base of The Ladder?- a few terminology mismatches.",2016
6,The Path just started up and the first two episodes were released to introduce us the Meiyerism cult.,2016
6,"The Path centers around a cult in upstate New York with various characters either falling deeper into it or adjusting to life outside of it. Weaving together an impressive number of existing religious practices and mythologies, creator Jessica Goldberg builds an impressively intricate religious world view for her characters from the ground up.",2017
9,This is a fantastic show! The actors are all very good! I liked how quickly the story line moves and that there was a lot of dialog in each episode. To me the last 1/2 of season 2 was the best. You know it is good acting when you despise or love the characters and feel each episode for what it is. Looking forward to more seasons!,2017
10,"I love SJP. I saw her in a Facebook Live interview talking about this show and her interest in long-term relationships, divorce, adultery, etc. and why couples stay together or fall apart. And how some thrive afterwards and some completely self-destruct. SJP, in real life, is so lovely, intelligent and fascinating, so I am willing to give this show a chance. I subscribed to HBO because of this show. ",2016
8,"I think perhaps this show is marmite. I am in the 'love it' camp, although I have to admit it's like slowing down to watch an accident and feeling relieved that's not you! SJP is predictable in her delivery of the stylish, smart yet ditsy cheating mother; she won't shake off her role in SATT that easily. Her on screen husband, (Thomas Haden Church) absolutely steals the screen with his honest, believable delivery as the deeply hurt and very bitter Robert. He is very entertaining and amusing. This show gets better as it goes on, and I couldn't wait for the next episode! I think anybody who has been through a separation or divorce will find something in this show to relate to. For me, it's the reminder that you can indeed fall in love with someone only to realise some years later that you can't stand to be near them! Maybe we can make ourselves feel a little better by gawping at their car crash lives; their pain, disappointment, failures, and their subsequent reckless stupid behaviour!",2016
4,"I can think of many interesting ways of narrating the crisis of values, substance and purpose in married life, while exposing vulnerabilities and self-questioning, and underscoring the elusive quest for happiness.",2016
2,"I stuck with it for the season finale, but I wish I had not. ",2016
2,"ALL of these characters are horrible. They're all superficial dumbos and I think that's supposed to be funny in a sad and dark humor kind of way, but it's not!!! I don't buy that these relationships are real because you might as well just kill yourself if they were. The kids don't even seem to like their Mom(SJP) and Dad and I don't blame them. I've watched multiple episodes hoping it'd get better, to my shame, but my only hope now is that HBO does not green light another season of this disgusting show. I don't blame the acting, maybe the casting a little, but mainly the writing. This show will make you feel like like trash deep down inside.",2016
5,"""I want to save my life while I still care about it."" Ugh, now there is just about the most unoriginal utterance I've ever heard on TV except perhaps the title of this series. So that's what this is about, some brain-dead yuppie who has spent her entire life buying crap to make her life worth caring about (in her estimation) but now realizes that she sold herself a few lifetimes short.",2016
5,"When Divorce came out I read a review comparing it with creator Sharon Horgan's other series, Catastrophe, and wound up checking out that one before Divorce. I haven't quite decided what I think of it, but there's a great chemistry between the leads and some good jokes.",2016
2,"I won't start by comparing this show to sex and city because they are completely different. But I will let you know that this show has the most unlikable characters I've ever seen in a series. We all know you can't make a show if everyone hates the characters. They are basically a bunch of grumpy men and grumpy women thrown all together to make a show. The characters are all so cold you could not possibly relate to them: Sarah Jessica Parker's character is distant, her husband is an idiot, her friend is crazy to the point where it's not even funny anymore, and the french guy is a weirdo. Her kids were kind of irrelevant, her daughter calls her a bitch, then Sarah Jessica Parker's character apologizes to her? Seriously? Good parenting 'The affair' is supposed to be the surprise of the plot when really, it's just sad once you find out who she's having an affair with: a complete douche bag! Did I mention that it's a humorless show? How is it a comedy if there are no jokes or witty remarks or something to think about, honestly I didn't even laugh once, and I kept waiting for it to come but the humour never did. This is just a bad story about a distant unlikable couple who nobody can begin to care about enough to watch what unfolds.",2016
1,"I'd read some reviews before viewing and almost didn't even bother to watch, expecting it to be just awful. Truly a waste of time.",2016
3,"So lets analyze, Sarah Jessica Parker's other major claim to fame was a show where she encouraged women to hold out, sleep around, and only settle for a ""Mr. Big"" with money and status. Now, her next series is a show where she encourages women to dump their loving prosperous husbands once they reach upper-middle age so they can be alone and happy...",2016
10,After watching 2 episodes I can say this one is a keeper. It gets really funny in episode 2. A middle aged couple with 2 teenage kids going through a divorce is the subject of this HBO comedy - and it is more a comedy than drama.,2016
2,I remember when I watched War of the Roses and found myself thinking how pathetic these people were.,2016
9,"Good storyline, believable and real, and great acting, especially by Robert, the husband. I also enjoy watching the unfolding disbelief of a woman who has been having an affair but all her considerations and expressions and thoughts for the future are only about *her*....a typically female reaction to any situation in life. One thing I don't understand though, which seemed so stupidly American, is why she let him lock her out the house in the closing scene. Anyone else would pick up a rock, smash that glass, unlock the door, and walk inside. Or call the police, who have nothing to do with civil details (ie: ""I want to divorce her""), and are concerned only with what's someone's right and what's not: and it's her right to go into her house until there is some legal decision that disbars her from doing that. Bad ending...weak. But brilliant otherwise. I love also how the show starts out and you assume it *is* all about her, but Robert turns that on it's head: NOW IT'S ABOUT ME, he's saying. Good on him!",2016
4,"The only reason to watch this series would be Sarah Jessica Parker, that is if you're a big fan (and like most Hollywood actors she could not resist some unfortunate face changing Botox). Otherwise the male lead (T.S. Church) is quite unbearable: really mediocre acting, miscast, boring and unlikeable character. The script is slow and tedious at least after the third episode. The husband's never ending angry comments are not only exaggerated and tasteless but delivered in a totally unconvincing manner. There is definitely no chemistry between the two and no hint of humour -which is too bad because SJP's kind of acting is generally better suited for romcoms. The story is in desperate need of something: a better rhythm, a different male protagonist, a better dialogue or at least a decent subplot but even that wouldn't be enough to save it. I don't think the series will last long.",2016
8,"Frances and her husband Robert attend a dinner party of her friend Diane and her husband Nick. I won't spoil it, but something happens at the dinner party which makes Frances question her own marriage. ",2016
7,Stick with it...SJP is not the prettiest actress but she is so true to life and this series does have some laugh out loud moments.....SJP is the villain and if you take morality out of it than you can see why she had an affair. The husband gets better and you do start to emphasise with him a bit... any one who's ever been a couple will resonate with what both parties do in either seeking a little bit of revenge or at least how to alienate your partner...... I've only watched three episodes to date and not seen much of the children but I would say watch it as it's 25 minutes of loose entertainment with some real funny moments,2016
5,Watched first two episodes:,2016
1,"This show is about miserable unlikeable people who are too stupid to see the good in their own lives. I have been divorced and have 2 children, this is NOT a true representation unless you are a miserable spoiled person with nothing better to do.
Dont waste your time on this terrible production. Expected more from HBO and the cast. I guess HBO is getting desperate to compete with NETFLIX",2018
10,THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS: ,2016
7,"HBO's Divorce is a story about one particular couple, not all couples. This is representative of your divorce. Every circumstance is different. Sarah Jessica brings her eloquent, expressive and warmly whimsical acting style to the role of flawed but relatable Frances who feels trapped and repressed in her marriage to Robert, played by Thomas Haden Church. The pair seem oddly mismatched from the beginning, with Roberts brutish ways, crude humour and arrogant demeanor in complete contrast with Frances' refined ways. ",2016
8,SJP great as always and love that she is an Executive Producer! Thomas Haden Church steals the show in my opinion - would not be as good of a show without him....can't wait for Season 2! All of the cast does a great job and are perfect for each of their roles. The subject matter is difficult and sad but the way it is written makes scenes so funny. I laughed out loud on the plane when I watched some of the episodes while traveling.,2017
9,"I needed to sit through the first couple of episodes to get into this show, but now I am a loyal watcher. The cast in this show is exceptional. Thomas Haden Church and Sarah Jessica have surprisingly good chemistry. Tracy Letts and Molly Shannon the same. Talia Balsam and Dean Winters are perfectly cast, and are funny as hell. Since this show is filmed in and around NYC, there is a deep and talented pool of theater talent to support the show, notably J. Smith-Cameron (who is a national treasure). All the actors in this show are allowed to actually ACT, and make bold choices, rather than do the typical mumble-speak ""behavior"" you see in a lot of television shows these days. Very much looking forward to season 2.",2017
6,"Over the course of the first season, there is a massive shift in tone. The first few episodes are sweet, charming, funny, and full of heart. By the end of the season, the show is dark and the characters become flat and unlikable, even loathsome. The first 3 episodes were written and directed by the same people, but as others step in to take over these roles, the dynamic of the show is irreversibly altered, and for the worse. The original writer steps back in for the last two episodes, but by then, it is too late, and the damage has been done. The relatability of the characters has been completely removed and the connection to the audience is lost. Rather than having hope for the characters, both the main characters and supporting cast, the viewer is left hoping they would all just perish in a fiery car crash. I, for one, will not be tuning in for the second season.",2017
4,"After seeing this movie, and then seeing the other reviews for it online, I felt the need to write my opinion in order to share why some did not like it and why I feel it could have been far better under different direction.",2016
5,"I had fun seeing this movie. It's an overall good popcorn flick. But if you are, as i'am, a little demanding about movies, you'll feel in the end that they gave a great amount of attention to the digital/special effects aspect of the movie and very little to the screenplay. In the end, if you're one of those weirdos who stay and watch the credits out of respect for the crew who made the movie possible, you'll notice that digital, cgi and special effects have huge teams of dozens of computer geeks who master an art that fills 90% of today's action movies. That's saying a whole lot of the movies industry these days.",2016
9,"I was lucky enough to be among the press-junket last Wednesday to witness this movie! I usually rate movies by different aspects, but i'll also answer some questions my friends had about this film which I also had myself!",2016
10,"Without giving away too much, Benedict Cumberbatch just kills it. He is one class actor. Cumberbatch rocks as Strange and pulls it off with ease. The impressions his portrayal gives us is that he was born to play the role of the ex-neurosurgeon turned Sorcerer Supreme. Such is the talent of the lead cast, that it represents just how good the movie was overall. Every normal movie watcher will love the action, humour, adventure and fantasy throughout the film.",2016
3,Doctor Strange was a painful movie to watch. ,2016
9,"Wow! DOCTOR STRANGE is an incredible mindtrip. Its VFX alone makes Christopher Nolan's 'Inception' look like some kind of beta test. And this film is so much fun, it's hilarious, it's got some of the most complex, most elaborate action sequences I've seen all year, and I can't stop geekin' out about the cloak of levitation. This is Benedict Cumberbatch making his grand entrance into the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",2016
7,Perfectly enjoyable fun. Sound familiar? Doctor Strange being a different kind of hero doesn't really excuse most of this film's conventional plotting.,2016
3,"Despite the visual similarities to Inception, Doctor Strange (in 3D) looks incredible. In places it's breathtaking. Without a doubt, this is the closest to tripping you can experience in a cinema. However, all this eye-candy fails to hide the fact that underneath it all is a terrible, terrible, by-the-numbers film. It makes the same fatal error as Finn fighting Kylo Ren in The Force Awakens. The villain is powerful and experienced, but our hero, who is a beginner, manages to defeat him. This is only one of dozens of 'groan out loud' moments. ",2016
4,"I went into the movie among high hopes. My friends told me it was fantastic and there were scenes that were ""out-of-this-world"". So entering this movie (with a certain elevation) I had high expectations. But it fell incredibly short.",2016
8,This is my review of Doctor Strange (spoiler free) ,2016
1,"Let me get this out of the way first. Yes, the visuals and special affects were amazing. It was nice and polished. But that is a given for a super hero movie. You can CGI a hurricane or atomic bomb if you wanted to. Pretty colors are standard.",2016
1,What a dung heap. ,2016
2,"Just terrible. If you're easily fooled by tricks and enjoy shallow, time wasting plot lines, this one might be for you. The tired mechanic of using a foreign location to add some weak validity to the mystic crap is turned on full throttle in this one. Like batman on the mountain, How else could Dr Strange come to learn these neat-o things? NEPAL, of course. Just another overblown monstrosity to cram in your face while doing the same with 17 cups of popcorn. Whether it's because of the wild and overused ""mindfuck"" CG, or the tired attempt to make the protagonist seam likable, in a Tony Stark, ass-hole sort of way, this one is best left for $2 Tuesday, and you decide which. Three thumbs down.",2016
2,"Seriously I am really impressed by the movie's atrocious script. It was basically 'Iron Man' just turned sorcerer. A rich, successful and arrogant man goes through hardship. Except there was actually some character development in 'Iron Man' and Doctor Strange had as much as character development as Roger Moore's James Bond. Which makes for a rather dull plot progression. The story was lazy too, it was mostly just there as an excuse for boring CGI effects. ""Here are the good guys and here are the bad guys and here is our obnoxious, arrogant hero who under appreciates women. Go!"" It was all eye candy. The characters consisted of stereotypes. Like in a Disn√©y movie. Apparently the producers spent so much money on the CGI they could not afford a decent script. The CGI scenes were not even that good because, they just rip off '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'Inception'. Creative? Absolutely not! Speaking of bad script, if the Ancient One was so powerful, what took her so damn long to help Strange and Mordo fight Kaecilius? Or how about Strange and Mordo were just standing there watching the Ancient One fighting Kaecilius which resulted in her getting killed? How about Strange was so irresponsible for leaving a dimensional hole in the cleaning closet? What a pathetic hero.",2016
3,"While Doctor Strange should be praised for its' amazing visuals and CGI effects, the movie is filled with a less than logical plot line and various plot holes, such as Doctor Strange throwing people into portals while they still have their Sling Rings, not using his cape in many various scenes with which it would have been extremely useful, being accepted quickly and without test into the temple simply because of his ""dedication"", and Strange being able to master the art of sorcery better than the dozen or so other sorcerers, who are almost completely ignored in all of the action scenes throughout the movie, while Strange is shown as extremely skilled and powerful at his newly learned skill.",2016
2,(spoilers ahead!),2016
8,"This isn't really a review, more or an informal statement.",2016
3,"I don't normally go these types of films, and I should have learned my lesson after going to see the latest Star Wars instalment last year. I had read the special effects in 3D were worth the admission price alone, so I thought it would at least be entertaining.",2016
4,"Poorly scripted film, with no intention (or in any event achievement) of character development. The result - I just did not care what happened to who.",2016
5,"Dr. Steven Strange is a brilliant neurosurgeon. He is at the peak of his career when a car accident leaves him with nerve damage in his hands, and unable to continue his career. He tries everything to remedy the situation, but nothing works. In desperation he travels to Kathmandu, Nepal, to seek the an organisation known as Kamar-Taj. What he finds goes beyond healing, or the physical world.",2017
8,"In terms of the quality of the film as a whole, I would give Doctor Strange a 7, but because of its visual effects and implications for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I am totally giving it an 8. Let me explain.",2017
9,"How can so many people get this this movie wrong, especially the critics? The high point of the film is the performance by Emelia Clarke. She is hair-brained, and scatty, completely adorable and wonderful.The camera-work is gorgeous and the soundtrack is second to none.",2016
8,"One of the best Romantic movies lately.. I am very taken with Emilia Clark's performance and smile. She was amazing and breathtaking. The music is well chosen and the acting is good and there were some very touching moments that will make the audience who didn't watch yet cry. Lou is a funny young woman who wants to live a simple life, who wants to wear clothes and be fashionable in her own way. The paralyzed man is a damaged cause looking for hope. Both these characters are very different, yes they pick things from each other and they put smiles on each others faces. A couple that wouldn't get bored giving and taking to their souls.. Maybe, when it comes to believing in love unconditionally, Faith is hope then. Live the life as it faces you then. In health and sickness. In the sweetest moments and bitterest ones. Just live your life No matter what happens to you. Always get back and fight to survive and be alive. That is what this movie is all about...",2016
10,"At times I feel that humanity has forgotten, or never really knew, what it is to really love someone. Jojo Moyes obviously isn't one of those people. Love isn't the lust we feel at the beginning of a relationship. It's not the thoughtful vision we compile of what the future could be like or how compatible we are. It's not about how financially successful a prospective partner is. It's certainly not all about sex, although it would be hard to come to this conclusion when the media generally plays strongly to that idea. It's the undeniable, overwhelming pull from our hearts that grows only when we really let ourselves care about someone unselfishly. ",2016
10,"The movie really was adorable! I knew exactly what to expect since I read the book, but I loved the adaptation. ",2016
10,"This film is getting mixed reviews, but I really enjoyed it. A very bittersweet film that will leave you feeling happy and sad at the same time. I never read the book that which this film is based on. But sometimes movies are never has detailed has the books they are based on.",2016
10,"I admit that I have read the book and so when the movie came out, I just HAD to go see it. So I drag my poor husband and we went to watch a late show that was relatively full. I didn't tell him anything about the movie and I watched him watching it. He actually really enjoyed it. The movie was lovely. The movie itself was beautiful. The scenery was set somewhere is rural England. There are green pastures, a castle and beautiful stone walkways. ",2016
8,"All movies can be scrutinized for faults, as some reviewers have done, but if the movie makes a mark, then those faults really don't matter, do they? I found the ""angry"" Will Traynor not completely believable, not like the anti-social Jack Nicholson in As Good As It Gets, but Sam Clafin did well with his transformation. Emilia Clarke was absolutely wonderful and I will be on the lookout for other roles she has taken and will undertake in the future. Kudos also to the characters who played Will's parents, Janet McTeer and Charles Dance. Two thumbs up for the movie. Am seriously considering whether the movie ought to bump another movie off my favorite 50 relationship movie list.",2016
10,"Thea Sharrock's film adaptation of Jojo Moyes's ""Me Before You"" is one of those hidden gems, which we should all watch rather early than later. ",2016
10,"I was expecting the usual American love story, but that's not what this is. I have neither seen nor heard of these actors prior to seeing this film. That said, I usually don't go to see films like this.",2016
7,Felt very derivative of Intouchables I did however really enjoy the romance that was in this film.,2016
8,"I loved this movie. It stayed very true to the book and I love the book. I think Emilia Clarke was born to play her. I feel like she was just playing herself cause she has a personality like that in real life. It was pure joy to watch her play Lou. The expressions she makes, the way she talks and most of all, her amazing clothes! I loved every single outfit she wore. This film made me laugh and it made me very emotional, just like the book. I think Sam Claflin was also born to play Will. They had an amazing chemistry throughout the entire film and the rest of the cast is also spot on. There are of course some parts from the book that were left out but nonetheless, this film was still amazing. I also want to point out that the soundtrack of the movie is amazing as well.",2016
10,"I have already read the book, so I decided to most definitely see the movie. I think that they did very well on a book to movie adaptation, because they didn't change too much from the book. The movie was beautifully made, and fit just what I and others who have read it in my city had pictured for the movie.",2016
7,"I wouldn't consider myself the target audience for these romantic dramas. In fact, I'm usually turned off by the overabundance of forced clich√©s and unnecessary plot devices. While Me Before You definitely falls victim to some of those unfortunate young adult tropes, there's far more charm than harm here. ",2016
9,"i have watched very little of the movies which were based on any ROMANTIC BOOKS like ""The Fault in Our Stars"", but this movie is and will be one of the Greatest and one of the Best Romantic Movie I would have ever watched.",2016
10,This film is one of those rare instances where a novel (by JoJo Moyes) is adapted for the screen by the novelist and finds a sensitive director such as Thea Sharrock and the result is a story that could have been sanguine but instead is an enriching emotional journey. To discover this film among all the crime and killing and morbid vampire or other undead creatures stories and overblown CGI comic book/fairy tale adventures is a breath of fresh air.,2016
9,"I never thought I'd watch a movie and laugh and cry at the same time. I don't know how the actors were selected but I must say the combination is a miracle. I wish I knew Emilia Clarke (Lou) personality to figure out the gap between the real her and the character she played in this movie. After watching this movie, I became so emotional. I felt love and loved. I watched it alone and wish I did with my girlfriend. Although the ending got me nervous, it was cool. I couldn't think of something better. Big thumbs up for the whole Me Before You crew. You guys did it. I wasn't a big fan of love stories but now, that's where I'm heading.",2016
9,"Emelia Clarke's work on Game of Thrones is the only reason I watched this movie in the first place. She is occasionally transcendent in that role, where she must keep her eyebrows restrained, and I wanted to see what would happen if her amazingly mobile brows were set free ... free as her dragons.",2016
9,"This is a sweet combination of all factors in the movie; the actors, the actresses, the choices of the places, the story plot, even the soundtrack. I love every single of it. Expect to feel warm and heartbroken at the same time in the movie. It's been says after watching it, I still cant stop thinking about this movie. You'd better watch it with someone who could provide a shoulder to cry on for you... :)) My favorite (which seems to be everyone's favorite as well) is during the wedding ceremony where Will seemed so alive again. My most heart-breaking scene is when Will said ""will you be here?"" on the last scene. That is when I burst into tears a lot. like A lot.",2016
9,"Once again, Emilia Clarke does not disappoint. The acting truly was brilliant. Both on her part and on Sam Claflins part. The film reminded me of The Untouchables a bit. It was a very pleasant sight to the eye to see the bond forming between Will and Lou. Decent amount of humor as well, found myself laughing quite often in fact. It is nice to sometimes be able to empathize with the characters as well. I can't really think of anything negative at this point either. Maybe that most of the movie was kind of predictable. The ending, however, might not have been as predictable. I didn't want to go to this movie myself, but was asked to see it. In hindsight I'm glad I tagged along, because I did really enjoy watching it.",2016
9,"Me Before You is a romantic drama film directed by Thea Sharrock based on the novel by Jojo Moyes with the same name. The film stars Emilia Clarke, Sam Claflin, Jenna Coleman, Charles Dance, Matthew Lewis, Ben Lloyd-Hughes and Janet McTeer. The movie is about a girl named Lou Clark who is desperate for a job and so the goes on to take care of a recently paralyzed man from a rich family, who she slowly creates a bond with. This is a well made movie with amazing performances all around, especially by the amazing Emilia Clarke who gives a wonderful performance on the leading role. By her side is Sam Claflin who plays Will Traynor, and he does a very good job too. It is a movie filled with heart breaking emotional scenes, very good cinematography and a brilliant score by Craig Armstrong that makes Me Before You as a whole one of the best romances there are. Sure it has some problems, and the ending will leave some people confused and angry but overall this movie works on so many levels that those flaws are hardly even noticeable as the good outweighs the bad by a lot.",2016
10,"A film is a work of art. An author's expression, the director's creativity, the performer's charisma and the captivating music can embrace a person and touch some of those primal feelings, hidden deep within vaults in our heart. ",2016
8,I liked this movie. I like the dialogue its quite charming and the comedy bits work really well .I was pleasantly surprised that there were not clich√© moments and the flow of the story came naturally . The 2 main characters have great chemistry and Emilia Clark is simply adorable .Its a simple story told well.,2016
10,You know when you actually feel GRATITUDE to Hollywood and incredible talent? This is it. ,2016
1,"So you can tell I'm not a fan of this film just by my title and score. The movie itself is okay at best. Emilia Clarke does a well enough job with the role because the character she is playing is pretty much who she is in real life; in other words, this role didn't require Emilia acting much and that is a good thing because people are slowly figuring out that she has a very limited range when it comes to acting. Towards the end of the movie is when her limited acting range becomes apparent thanks to the crying scenes, most of the scenes she does with tearless crying which help to take you out of the movie. Don't get me wrong, her acting isn't bad until the end when she is forced to show another emotion other than bubbly. I should note the director does an excellent job of hiding a good amount of Emilia's emotional scenes by having her hug someone and then showing mostly the other person's face. I can write a whole book on Emilia's overrated acting chops but I'm not here to do that so let me carry on with this review. If it wasn't for the ending, where we finally learn the real message of the film I would have ranked the film about a 6 out of 10. But halfway into the film we learn the quadriplegic character made a deal with his parents that he will end his life after 6 months. During the film we learn this guy is smart and etc, etc. Someone even points out that he could go back to work if he wanted to but this guy is hell bent on killing himself for the simple reason of which happens to be that he misses his old life so he is giving up on this life. And apparently that is a good enough reason to let the man kill himself. Great message to put out there into the world. We recently lost Muhammad Ali. We all know about Muhammad Ali's condition and we all saw the impact he had on the world both before and in spite of his condition. He fought until the bitter end and became more of a legend because of it. This movie encourages people to take the easy way out. Now, I can understand how depression can play a role in all of this but this character is a pretty boy with a sh!t load of money.. and on top of that he found the love of his life and she is more than ready to be with him forever. But his reasoning is that he would only be a burden on her living her life. So yeah, this movie pretty much matches the materialistic and self- absorbed nature of what these modern times have transformed into. Whatever, the movie is a chick flick at best so I don't care. Apparently suicide isn't frowned upon when a quadriplegic is concerned. Moral of the story, you have nothing to contribute to society once you become paralyzed. Maybe this movie was funded by the government as a way of reducing the cost of people with disabilities on healthcare. Euthanasia for the win! Frankly, a disgusting message and an even more disgusting movie.",2016
8,So at first I thought it was going to be another pretty predictable movie and I was only watching it because I love Emilia Clarke. But I was actually pleasantly surprised. The movie was not predictable at all and really was special for a lot of reasons. ,2016

10,Imagine what would happen if the famous three were told by Amazon to do what they want and spend as much as you like - because clearly that's what happened here and the end result is AWESOME!,2016
10,"So there was nothing to worry about after all! After the kerfuffle surrounding the end of the three presenting TG at the Beeb, I honestly thought that wherever they went nothing would be the same again in the motor show universe. ",2016

3,"To start off, I am a massive Top Gear fan and have been for a long time. I can watch endless re-runs and never get tired of it. I was really excited to see what these three would come up with, given free reign.",2016
5,"Where to start. Well, i had big hopes for the show with the 3 beloved idiots. Now, after 2 episodes, my hopes were shattered. Why? Lets have a look inside, i will briefly point out the differences to the original show, or what the grand tour delivers (or not). ",2016
1,"After the excellent start made in episode one in the USA the trio came crashing to earth in episode two in South Africa. It was simply pathetic: motoring content was minor and almost coincidental, confined to one Clarkson review of the Aston Martin, the item on smoking tires was more relevant to a program on township culture (sic) and the 50% of the show on the SAS spoof in Jordan was far too long and self-indulgent. The opening banter was good and the jokes about Jacob Zuma very topical and clearly enjoyed by the South African audience. Who is the curmudgeonly version of Stig? He's very unfunny. There is also something significantly wrong with the test track which seems far too narrow and twisty to give the TV audience any impression of true speed. The trio really wasted the opportunity in South Africa: reviewing the huge range of vehicles in the game parks, racing the Blue Train in a hummer to avoid elephants etc. They made no real use of the location. If the next two episodes are as bad I'll be canceling my Prime subscription.",2016
3,Watching the Grand Tour is like watching a Hollywood pastiche of Top Gear.,2016
4,"I used to be a fan, I used to love this show and surely elements of it I still love. But, this show has been beat up, rolled through the mud and punched in the groin by Hollywood.",2017
5,"Barely scraping through for a passing grade, the new series of The Grand Tour has not lived up to the hype. It seems to be running almost entirely on the popularity of the hosts and the blind following of the fans the accrued over at Top Gear.",2016
2,"I didn't want to write off the grand tour after the first episode, so I waited until the second one dropped at least. ",2016
10,"It's amazing how well the trio slips right back into top form in the first episode of the Grand Tour. I loved the first episode, and I wish I could watch the rest of the season right now. This show is funnier than most of the comedies on TV, and it has to be one of the most gorgeous shows on TV, as they really spared no expense on the production values. They even have some excellent CGI showing how each hybrid engine works.",2016
10,"I just watched an impressive, thoughtful, provocative, memorable, perfect first episode of the first season. ",2016
10,"As a great fan of Top Gear, I was looking forward to the Grand Tour. Episode one showed great promise. Superb intro and great selection of cars promised well of the future. Disappointing new test track and the new test driver is horrible. If they must have an American driver, get one with some charisma. Episode two got off to a good start with the AM Vulcan, but the Desert Stumble really was well named and some of the other slots seemed to lack the spark that these three used to show. I just hope the program can pick itself back up. The old TG did stumble a few times, but I cannot remember anything as bad episode 2 of GT. Maybe this is the strategy so that Episode 3 appears better.",2016
1,"I was a fan of the old show, I expected too much perhaps of Grand tour. Recycled jokes, forced bon Amie and the elephant in the room very little about cars. Episode three of Grand Tour a passing comment made about a British comedy 'last of the summer wine' three old bumbling gifts in their twilight years repeating lame punchlines in every one of the 10 million episodes to the delight of the senile audience, well I think it's hard to distinguish them apart as Clarkson, May and Hammond wryly smiled as I think they do too.",2016
1,"It is hard for me to believe that Amazon condones ""The American"" as representative of any motorsport driver in the United States or Grand Tour's fan base.",2016
2,"I rarely, ever write reviews for anything. But, having been a fan of Top Gear Since the 1990's I was just mortified at the sheer piece of bullshit that these people have created. I was fine till the first episode and gave the benefit of the doubt to the producers for not getting it right. But, the second one was just horrific. It was not about cars at all, it was about three old dudes trying desperately hard to act funny and failing at it miserably. The last half hour was just a pain. If any of the producers are reading this, then please, please, please do something about it. Otherwise this rating of 9+ won't stay there forever. To add to your woes, I believe the Top gear (new anchors) was far better in their first 2 episodes. The only thing carrying you guys was you fan following, thats it !!!",2016
10,"From the first trailer we knew this was going to be something worth watching. And it sure was. Clarkson, Hammond and May come back with this refreshing look and take on a car show. The backdrops to each episode look stunning and the guys are on a better form then they ever have been. I'm glad they left the BBC because it gave them time to create something new that was not going to dry out and become dull and also gave us time to get ready for something that will change the way TV is made. Thank you Grand Tour.Is this the same as Top Gear? No and yes. The shows format is altered but their is still a track and a racing driver, The American, who takes over from The Stig and The News is now Conversation Street. If you are hesitant about buying Amazon, you won't be disappointed.",2016
1,"I wont waste much time reviewing this crap... To start i loved Top Gear back in the days, i was looking forward to seeing the TGT, but it came out stupid, childish & irritating as hell!",2016
4,"How Grand Tour can be rated by users at 9.5 is beyond me.... I like cars, I don't mind the presenters and Amazon have clearly thrown a lot of money at this but come on it's nothing special. Some of the finest, most classic feature films ever made don't get a rating above 9. But interestingly I notice that IMDb have the same looking login page as Amazon.... hmmmmm, I'd like to think IMDb was not biased?? Anyway the latest episode, the training ground episode in Jordan was just unnecessarily long, I had to force myself to carry on watching. I hope the show starts to focus more on motoring than pointless tasks that centre on the presenters.",2016
2,Seems Andy Wilman has tried to turn the trio into actors....and they simply are not. The brain crash scene is just ridiculous and not at all entertaining for a home viewer. Is this really not a car show anymore? It feels more like car crash TV at time as the staged gags are just not funny. Repeated scenes rewinding with subtle differences over and over and over again just feels like padding....not action packed content that viewers have paid a premium for. What happened to the kind of epics we used to love touring Vietnam or Africa or the poles? ....please tell me this show is not just setting up a tent in different places and presenting from it. Really disappointed so far...honestly think Matt le-blanc and Chris E did a better job on TG for a quarter of the budget.,2016
1,"Top Gear was always scripted. The hosts have always been petulant children. The acting has always been bad and obviously so.. they've managed to take that to a all-new level, a American one. Every single scene feels fake and as if it's the 3rd or 4th take of said scene we're seeing. Nothing feels genuine or natural, including the chemistry between the hosts, and so it ends up feeling like heavily scripted and instructed reality-TV (barf!).",2016
1,"As a huge fan of the Clarkson, May and Hammond top gear, I was like many of us really looking forward to The Grand Tour, I'm afraid to say I am totally disappointed with this reincarnation. One of things I most enjoyed about TG was the specials the challenges and the guests, why didn't they spend the huge budget Amazon provided them with on producing these? instead we are untreated to overly long segments of what can only be described as filler television, in episode 2 they spend about 15 minutes basically just repeating the same not very funny joke in which James May gets killed trying to reach a get away car, it was like being in groundhog day, I actually felt embarrassed watching it. Terrible television.",2016
8,"For the movie I gave it an 8. That's based on 32 years of military service, 7 combat tours (3 in Iraq) and working with the likes of the characters in the movie. Sorry for those who's lives were so well protected that they've never been exposed to the likes of us but, that's how we talk and act. It's a type-A environment and we use it to protect ourselves and motivate our brothers in arms.",2016
8,Benghazi.,2016
9,"I found this movie to be very intense and riveting. The audience seemed to have a need to make an unusual number of trips to the snack bar and rest room and I found myself becoming frustrated by the number of interruptions. The movie is not for the faint of heart, as there are a number of scenes with graphic depiction of injuries. Regardless of your political affiliation, if you have any thoughts about what happened at Benghazi, you need to see this movie. Michael Bay does a great job of portraying what happened. Additionally, with the exception of one individual who s portrayed as not wanting to take action, he does not take the obvious opportunity to lay blame at any single individual in the US government. He clearly portrays a small group of men as heroes. Without their courage and willingness to fight against what appears to be an overwhelming force many more lives would have been lost. I do not often see movies twice, but this movie is likely to be an exception... In closing, if Michael Bay is 90% accurate in his depiction of what happened, our government (the US government), owes a huge debt of gratitude and an apology for their lack of action to 6 very brave men.",2016
10,As polarizing as this movie is just put your politics aside and watch it. The attack is a part of history that deserves to be put on screen in as grand and well produced manner as can be. And in that sense it succeeds. The filming in Morocco and Malta captures a really on location feel. ,2016
8,"""Things change fast here in Benghazi."" Jack Silva (Krasinski) has just been reassigned as a guard for the US diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya. What starts off as a routine assignment changes on September 11, 2012. When a group of insurgents breach the Embassy and attempt to kill the US Ambassador, Jack and his group of 6 have to make a decision. Follow orders and stay away, or disobey their commander and go help their fellow soldiers. I was looking forward to watching this, but I was also a little worried at the same time. The story is interesting and somewhat controversial and is a perfect idea for a movie, but it was directed by Michael Bay. For that reason I was expecting a lot of special effects and explosions and didn't think he was the director that should be in charge of this story. I'm not ashamed to admit that I was wrong. This is a realistic war movie that doesn't embellish the drama or actions, mainly because the story didn't need it. The movie is not political at all and mainly focus on the soldiers decisions. I liked it more than I expected to. Overall, not just a surprisingly good Michael Bay movie, a good movie period. I give this a high B+.",2016
9,"The overall experience of the World Premiere was incredible, but this Movie in any venue would be worth the price of admission.",2016
10,Michael Bay did a masterful job of capturing the attacks on the U.S. compounds and the gallant efforts to save the ambassador and the other U.S. staff. He did an equally great job of showing career bureaucrats at work.,2016
9,"Riveting Authenticity is the first feeling I had when the movie ended. After watching these events unfold. If you don't feel for these real life men, soldiers, heroes, Americans.... You may want to consider a frontal lobotomy. Or just stop reading and/or watching anything political. This work is best viewed after removing the talking points/ talking heads. Only recount the actual time line of events from the Bengasi hearings on c-span. This work gives a mega phone to those who's voices where dismissed and a heart to those who can never speak again. Michael Bay clearly did the right thing by taking direction from those who where actually there. That is evident throughout the movie and really gives a heightened authenticity. One of the best historical war movies ever. Several emotions smack you hard throughout this movie. The acting was very well done by pretty much everyone. John Krasinski probably impressed me the most. I have not enjoyed much of anything he has done since the office. This is a rare film in that I will want to see again. I hope this work can help heal a country that was stabbed in the gut by the attempt to muddle the facts from that day.",2016
10,"I had to give the movie 13 Hours a solid 10. I am a huge fan of true stories and movies that are based off books, especially when the story is filmed true to the real. This thrill riveting masterpiece not only captivated the lives of these six soldiers and the people trapped between this battle between the Libyan rebels, but Michael Bay did an excellent job with his use of guns and sound system that he always does so well. You can't help but stay on the edge of your seats as you hope these brave men all make it to the end of the movie. This movie has non stop violence while these heroic soldiers attempt to rescue the ambassador as well as help the American residents escape. This movie will have you racing against time as we relive this Sept 11, 2012 event also called the ""Battle of Benghazi.""",2016
8,"13 Hours was absolutely riveting, no question. And it raises serious questions about the Benghazi attack, questions which have yet to be answered. But it's clear why critics are dissing it--it shows Americans as veritable superheroes in a country gone berserk. Also, the movie makes no bones of the fact that the whole ""protest over an anti-Islamic video"" explanation was totally bogus, and our country, protected by true blue men and women willing to give their lives, is run by a bunch of jackasses. I hope Hillary goes down for this. But three years later, no one has even been fired. ",2016
1,"You'd think after decades of recycling the same, tiresome war pictures, the film industry would produce one that diverges from the standard formula just to avoid lapsing into a coma out of monotony. But that would require Hollywood to have more than one collective brain cell and a shred of creativity, or at least a concern for anything other than guaranteeing maximum profits. ",2016
10,13 Hours is not for the faint of heart. It is not for children or for those with a weak constitution. Blood and gore alone is not the issue. The violence is almost non-stop. Our heroes and the people they protect face certain horrific death if they fail. And in some cases they do.,2016
1,"story that you are about to be told , there are a LOT of false things in this movie , starting with the city that it looks absolutely nothing like Benghazi (I mean come on guys , even pictures from Google will tell you that Benghazi doesn't look like that, you aren't even trying) we don't live in tents you idiots , to the atmosphere where it shows that Benghazi districts are like Afghanistan and you'll get pulled over with a gun to your head every time , and of course like we used to see in every Hollywood movie , American soldiers are flawless heroes and Rambos , I mean REALLY! when it comes to the last point all of America's modern wars are like this : a multi-million fighter jet dropping a multi-thousands bomb on few dollars worth tent in Afghanistan or whatever and in the end they cause massive civilian casualties (probably on purpose) , I mean Come on guys for how long you're gonna be fooling people like that ?? well not me of course , cause I know that this is never happened at all , I'll give you what happened..",2016
2,"I endured about a third of this before giving up. I guess this was aimed at drawing in those viewers whose lives revolve around the realism of the world of video games.

1,"It's a little soon for historical fiction to be coming out about this subject. Perhaps if it wasn't an election year I'd be less critical, but this film is basically wish-fulfillment propaganda with the usual assortment of Michael Bay shallow dialogue and hearty explosions. Quite simply, Mr Bay has created fictional people to fill in holes of fictional plot points that never actually existed. Add in his usual assortment of crappy dialogue and forced situations, and roll film.",2016
10,"A true movie some people in power do not want you to see, it shows how incompetent and disconnected the ruling class are at times. If ignorance is bliss, bliss is over rated I will take the truth no matter how disturbing. So as for how the movie looked it was awesome. The visual effects are stunning. Do not bring young children as it is extremely graphic in the violence, shootings and explosions. The acting of a couple of people was just OK but most will draw you in and connect with you. If you are a hard and fast supporter of certain political leaders do not go see this as you may have need to question your support. I left with mixed emotions of sadness, anger, disgust and proud to know that we have some real American hero's willing to give every thing for other Americans. People will say what they think really happened in Benghazi but the only ones who know are those who lived it. If anyone has a different account other than this one. Go make your own movie of ""what really happened was"", good luck with that.",2016
10,"The fact that this is a true story and a part of our reality and American history, you are completely drawn in unlike any movie of fiction. It's like a modern day Alamo, as our men must defend against hundreds of jihadists in a dangerous and fallen nation, while somehow the leadership in America leaves these Americans to die In one of the greatest acts of betrayal our nation has ever seen. The locations, action and people are incredibly authentic and well shot. A true story of bravery and betrayal that continues in our countries politics to this very day. Without a doubt one of the best and most important films of the year, an absolute must see!",2016
9,"Following in the footsteps of other January Released Modern War Flicks based on books (Lone Survivor and American Sniper), 13 Hours is thoroughly entertaining if I dare say the funniest of these films. 13 Hours for the most part takes away the political cluster of the Benghazi incident and mainly focuses on the job at hand for the 6 ""bodyguards"" protecting a secret CIA outpost. Which makes this film the perfect vehicle for Michael Bay to direct as it focuses on the action of the incident primarily.",2016

9,"I'm not a fan of Michael Bay movies. So many of his movies seem to be more explosions than plot. I leave the theater reeling from an overdose of special effects. With 13 Hours, though, Bay has delivered a well-done movie. Sure, it's still packed with a lot of explosives, but they are central to the story.",2016

Very family friendly, cute and sparkly!",2017

Sometimes i think so many reviewers feel they must pan movies as they don't relay various critical standards.. However, this one isn't one. i like many types of movies and this is one of them. a purely fun and colorful take on things. enjoy it for what it is and don't over think it! not all movies need that. it is great for kids and adults if you look at it as being simply fun! i am well over 21 and liked it very much!",2017
7,"I took my 5 1/2 year old daughter to watch Trolls, and for her it was a sight for sore eyes. The main character, Poppy (voiced by Anna Kendrick) is a fluffy, instantly lovable princess troll, who has been raised in a careless, yet slightly obnoxious, world - where everyone hugs each other on an hourly basis, poops cupcakes and bursts into sappy pop tunes in the blink of the eye. Her male counterpart, on the other hand, is all doom and gloom. This troll party pooper, named Branch and colored gray to differentiate him from the endlessly colorful group of merry trolls, keeps warning his friends that their loud lifestyle will put their lives in jeopardy, once the evil Bergens, who are only happy when they eat the tiny little Trolls, will take notice of them. Sure enough, this does happen pretty soon into the movie, and when several Trolls are taken - Poppy and Branch (who refuses to sing throughout the film, even though he is ironically voiced by Justin Timberlake) need to join forces in order to save them.",2016
10,"At first I had pretty low expectations for this film because of its first teaser, but then the first full length trailer made me look forward to it, and now that I've seen it, I have to say, you will enjoy this once you see it. It's very vibrant and filled with colour, which makes for a bright and exciting time, the trolls themselves are all really cute and colorful, and they are usually really funny in a situation and they are always positive and full of hope. It has a very well thought storyline, even if it does sound a bit generic at first, but it feels new and so fresh and original when you see it. And there is a lot of signing and dancing, and a lot of musical cues, and the songs really do get to you, as they are very catchy. And at times this film is very heartwarming, and a bit emotional at places, but that's sort of what you'd expect from a film like this. So overall, definitely see this one, as it is a cute, colorful, funny and heartwarming adventure that the whole family will enjoy!",2016
10,"After the Bergens invade Troll Village, Poppy, the happiest Troll ever born, and the curmudgeonly Branch set off on a journey to rescue her friends. When i watched the first trailer for 'Trolls' i didn't know what to expect but i'm happy to announce that the 6.5 rating here in IMDb is a big joke because this film was insane and all the songs were pretty amazing especially 'Can't Stop the Feeling' was the best of them all. Plus the voice casting was pretty spot on Anna Kendrick as Poppy was excellent, Justin Timberlake plays a troll called Branch that doesn't like singing and Zooey Deschanel as Bridget was easily my favorite part of the entire thing plus the ending of the movie was pretty great and with some pretty good messages for both kids and adults about what true happiness feels like. So overall let's bring on Trolls 2 now!!!",2017
2,"I very firmly believe that Trolls is the summation of cinematic garbage. It is only for one specific reason that I give this ""movie"" more than 1 star, and that is because it will most likely entertain your children. Where to even begin? At the beginning we are introduced to the main antagonists, the Bergens. It is rather unfortunate that most of the Bergens are more fleshed out than the main characters. Who are the main characters, you may ask? The titular Trolls. The Trolls can hardly even be called characters. None of them have any personalities, and I could just barely tell them apart from each other by their physical traits. There was ONE character I did not despise at the beginning, the character of Branch, a Troll who refuses to be happy like the rest of the village. This character was the only thing keeping me from falling asleep and completely despising this movie. However, he eventually is given a sob-story background, and becomes yet another of the cookie-cutter personalities infesting this picture like lice. In addition, the script is awful and generic, and the film cannot even decide what tone it wishes to take. Finally, my biggest gripe is that the Trolls are basically invincible. They are a community of Mary Sues and Gary Stus, who cannot seem to ever be harmed, even if they are repeatedly attacked. How did Dreamworks expect audiences to be emotionally invested in the narrative, when the main ""characters"" are never in any danger? I cannot recommend this movie, unless you wish to entertain your children for a short while.",2016
10,"No really, it did. I couldn't believe how nice this movie made me feel as I was watching it. The story is a pretty standard hero's journey, but with the evil trolls or grendels or whatever eating happy trolls to get happy themselves. It seemed a little dark at first, but everything works out in the end of course, as this is a kids movie. It shows good and bad in equal measure, which I believe is how we should educate kids, not keep them in a bubble. The lessons it teaches are actually nice, don't give up, persevere, happiness is within. The boy troll (Timberlake) is so funny, especially in the beginning. Anna Kendrick is hilarious with snappy dialogue. The songs are a bit old fashioned, the fact that the writer is nostalgic really stands out. But they fit the story, rather than being just music breaks, so it's good.",2017
3,"As parents we expect most movies we take our kids to, to be more for them and feel lucky if we get a few laughs. Trolls disappoints even mediocre expectations. It's totally reliant on colors, noises, and the singing voices of the lead characters. Many movies have adult jokes which children don't need to hear. This one has them, except they are not funny. The adults in the theater with me laughed at maybe 1/20 adult jokes. My son in the 7- 10 yr old range did say he really liked it, but when I asked him why his response was, ""I liked how everyone was happy,"" and ""the trolls."" The moral takeaway that was slightly present was lost in the pop. There are plenty of kids' movies that the whole family can be entertained and even moved by. Skip this one.",2016
4,"This movie is great for 5 yo girls. They'll love the abundant color, sparkles and soundtrack. Boys - not so much. My 9yo and his friend were squirming in their seats after the first 10 minutes, but the 7yo sister was entertained. Adults - well if you can drink a beer/wine or pass out until the end, this would be advisable - otherwise just shoot me.",2016
8,"I've read some reviews and to be honest some take this movie WAY TOO FAR and it's not a fair review for what is a really good movie for your family and/or children to really enjoy. As far as some characters that people can ""relate to"" in a kids movie and making a review comparing them to themselves and their life and how a certain character sends a wrong message is absurd and a little too much. THIS IS A KIDS MOVIE!! It doesn't send any bad messages whatsoever. My 5 year old loves it and I do too really. It's very funny, has good music, characters are unique and colorful. Only thing negative is the darkness in some of the Bergens and that they remind me of the movie Boxtrolls which I couldn't stand. But, they don't ruin the movie at all and I can live with most of them. Anna Kendrick can really sing and I had no idea she had that in her and of course Timberlake was great. I highly recommend this movie! In no way does it deserve anything under a 7/10!",2017
2,"This is going to be my first review, I reopened my account just for this. I must say that I am disgusted by the terrible message this movie gives off for young insecure and impressionable people. I had a really nice time with the movie for a while, but only because I could relate heavily to the slightly pessimistic lone wolf troll called Branch. It was such a nice breath of fresh air to see a character not being ""perfect"" according to society's norms these days. Branch is a loner who seems to be at his best when enjoying his own company, he is organized and he has made an effort to stockpile resources for the future years, while all the other trolls just partied and socialized until it became their downfall. This movie is an introvert's nightmare. It quickly becomes clear they wanted to portray that it is not okay for branch to not want to party and socialize all the time, he is presented as weird and none of the other trolls really want to interact with Branch because he is not like them.

Cause if you don't feel that this movie is great, then there must be something really broken inside you! This movie gave us nothing but beautiful music, great adventures, hilarious comedy, with a little hint of fairy tale inserted (Hello, Cinderella!). It also gave us a strong moral lesson, which is to never give up hope in any kind of bad situation. It also tell us to be brave, kind, and always try to see the bright side in everything. How can it be called anything except amazing? I'm a guy, but I'm deeply touched when I saw Poppy's sadness killing her happiness, turning her whole body grey but then Branch started healing her and reviving her colors back. I have to admit I cried when I witnessed that heartwarming event. The songs which were picked for this movie is spot on! Each and every one of them brushed this movie with joy, thrill, and spirit. This animation movie is nearly perfect in every aspect. If you want to feel happy, then you definitely need to watch this movie.",2017

From the low-quality of the animation itself to the story and music selection, there's is nothing innovative, ambitious, or worth viewing on anything other than free TV, and only then to keep the kids quiet and out of trouble.",2016
5,"I took my daughter to see it and I remembered when I had the toys. There wasn't a movie to go along with the dolls then, but they were so cute. It was a decent movie, but way too much singing. I know trolls are meant to be happy, but they sang too much. I felt they sang on every little thing they did. It is good for children because children like vivid colors and think the hair is cute. I did back then. I did like Branch because he saw what the other trolls did not see. The others let their guard down because they had years of being undisturbed by the bergens, but Branch was smarter. They learned a lesson from Branch and Branch learned something from them.",2016
8,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. We both enjoyed this DreamWorks Animation feature which is a musical with both original and familiar songs from decades past. Trolls is quite enjoyable about a group of happy-well, you know-who have to escape from a bunch of bigger monsters in order to survive as a species. There's also a somewhat Cinderella-like vibe involving a couple of those bigger characters. One of my favorite song performances involved the tune ""True Colors"" which me and my friend remembered being first recorded by Cyndi Lauper 30 years ago. Like most computer-animated movies we've seen in the last decade or so, Trolls is funny and touching in places. So on that note, that's a high recommendation!",2016
8,"Despite loving or really liking a good deal of DreamWorks' previous work, especially 'The Prince of Egypt' (for me their best to date and one of my favourite films, animated and ever) and 'How to Train Your Dragon' (also a favourite), expectations were low for 'Trolls'.",2016
8,"You know, when I first heard of this movie I groaned because I've always loathed those troll things, but then the trailer completely caught me off guard and now this is one of the animated movies I'm most excited for this year. Why? Considering the hideous troll dolls this was made after, this movie could SO easily have taken the Sony route and turned into another Smurfs or Alvin and the Chipmunks and brought the trolls to the real world, or maybe even taken the TMNT route and tried to turn them into hyper realistic creatures to fit into real life. Instead of doing either, DreamWorks actually set them up in an adorable world of their own, filled with plushie creatures, toys and glitter... and man this is creative as hell! Look at all the lovely designs for the creatures, not to mention the soft textures that make my hands itch to touch them. The animation looks fantastic and definitely caught my interest. I can't wait to see how they will play with such an interesting world gadecosmetics.se",2016
1,"It's a teen drama dressed as sci-fi. Each episode, all the way up to 8, which is where I left it, gives around 5 minutes of actual sci-fi. The rest of course being teen angst.

6,"Like other reviewers, I was quite pleased to discover a new series to start the new year with. The description sounded enticing, ""a young man wakes up from a coma after 12 years and discovers new abilities"" so I decided to give it a go.",2017
8,"So after binge watching the first 10 episodes, I'm now in a position to put forward a review a little bit more comprehensive than what's been posted previously (by the way, it's cheap*, not cheep).",2017
6,"Before I start I will say the series kept me interested. I wanted to find out what was in the conclusion of it. What are those faceless creatures, how did Holden get powers?",2017
7,"Found this by accident on Hulu and decided to watch it as I usually binge-watch Futurama and Archer on Netflix and wanted to try something different. I really enjoy the premise of this series: guy wakes up from 12-year coma and finds he has powers and has had a relationship with one of the most gorgeous girls I've ever seen in a place called the Realm during that time. The Realm turns out to be Purgatory... kind of. It's a place where humans are not supposed to be (as evidenced by all sorts of scary creatures looking to wipe you out) but our main character Holden develops some kind of element-warping powers that allow him to survive for so long. These powers follow him to the real world for reasons that have yet to be explained except by a throwaway ""you are the one"" line. There's an organization called Hollow Sky that wishes to use Holden's powers so that the villain pulling the strings can see his dead wife again and, from what I gather, use Purgatory as a kind of vacation destination for people to see their lost loved ones. Of course, this is considered insane and dangerous by those who aren't grief-stricken and this sets up the main conflict. I also enjoy some of the actors. Yellow Jacket is delightfully creepy and out of place, and even in slight comedic situations his flat affect is unchanged. Willa is also refreshing as the sensei (both in the metaphorical and literal sense), and she has a way of saying a lot with just her eyes. Where this show falls flat for me is the pacing. It seems like it takes forever to get going, and only just slighter faster when it does. I enjoyed the ""training"" scenes with Holden, but these are few and far between. What we get is a lot of family drama with a troubled younger brother and divorced parents, old friends dying and new friends coming in, a throwaway romance with another person in a coma... while I get that they were trying to tell a human story with powers and the afterlife as a backdrop, but I would prefer to have more powers and afterlife stuff and less human story (to a point. One can go the wrong way with that too). Perhaps, with character arcs already established, we'll get just that with season two.",2017
2,"This story is clearly for the feeble-minded. The only truly enjoyable part was the jeep flip at the end; this being one of the few times the hero actually had a spine. The ""Beyond"" characters drip with examples of being gullible and mindless and how easily others drink the Kool-aid organizations like cults and Scientology sell. It is complete with the Godless leader of said cult who is only in it for selfish,sociopathic reasons and his greedy corporate investors who have no regard for the value of human life. The hero makes so many stupid moves while the bad guys are trying to kidnap him your eyes will fall out of their sockets from rolling. The head bad guy wants to build a bridge from purgatory to heaven so you can go see your loved ones, but in fact it just attracts more bad guys. In reality, death is death- you'll see them again when you die yourself. Consult a medium if you need to contact your dearly departed before then. You'll never get those 7¬Ω hours back. Skip this TV series.",2017
1,"I can't believe I wasted ten hours of my life on a show that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. Usually when producers and writers want to pass bullshit off as plausible, they try to dress it up and not let the gaping plot holes look so gaping. But this was just ridiculous. Also, this show does not fall under the sci-fi category. It falls under the teen angst category.",2017
9,"I started watching Beyond with low expectations because the premise sounds pretty typical. Cute boy mysteriously receives powers and is forced into action to protect the cute girl. I'm glad I was pleasantly surprised. Its still a typical small town unwilling teen hero plot, but the story line is absorbing, the acting is good and the characters are interesting enough to drive the story forward. A nice mix of mystery, drama, action and a sprinkle of horror in a teen hero plot complete with all the eye candy needed in today's ADD environment. I either rate things high if I like it or low if I don't, I don't believe in anything that exists in between. Beyond gets my vote for a good TV show.",2017
6,"I found myself watching Beyond back to back solely because it's a new year and i wanted to start the year with a bang. However, it started to give me that 'The Tomorrow People' vibe after 3 episodes.",2017
4,"I don't agree with the other reviewers that this show suffered from terrible acting, or bad CGI, or even lack of plot. I do feel those aspects were there on a par with other teen dramas, like KyleXY or Vampire Diaries. What was missing was any reason to give even the slightest crap about anything that was happening, and that is down to the writers and the directors, totally failing to imbue the show with any emotional resonance at all. There is simply not one single character I cared about in any way, positive or negative, and what you always end up with in that case is simply a 'sequence of events', which -because they have zero emotional impact- are just totally boring and pointless. I gave this a generous 4 because from a technical point of view, it's not a total disaster. But it will leave you feeling empty inside, and that you wasted 10 hours of your life watching it.",2017
2,"Beyond showed potential but the lack of structure around Holden's powers, the clich√© statement's with overly dramatic music, and the weak character and acting of Willa make Beyond a lame drama. ",2017
2,"A couple of promising young actors -- Whitesell and Duffield -- are lost in a throng of TV-grade actors in a mire of rehearsed deliveries and forced boredom. Why are TV directors still allowing young women actors to get away with forced boredom with a nasal delivery? It's bratty and amateurish, and went out with ""OH MA GAWD!"" I feel bad for Martin Donovan in this role. The sci-fi angle is cheesy and worn out. He has done immense dramatic work in the past, but the script is so poorly written he can't ""bring his stuff."" What a waste and a shame.",2017
2,"Just to explain I just binge watched the ENTIRETY of this horrid show. Hours that I will never back of my life. I entered this show with an open mind. Thinking (and hoping) that hopefully, Burkely Duffield's acting would have improved in later years, unfortunately, I was horribly mistaken. But besides his, and the other laughable jobs played, I have many questions. Firstly, what was the plot? And as a follow-up, was there one, to begin with. Secondly, where was the CGI budget? Thirdly, Story lines were started for characters and never tied up or explained. This show is so confusing and everything is somewhat (but not really) kind of explained in the last two episodes. It was almost like the writers forgot to write the show. However, the only thing that truly made this whole endeavor worth it was seeing a knock off Dylan O'Brien play the character, Luke. I will give it two stars, only because it made me laugh.",2017
7,"I found this show enjoyable and it pulled me in. It has some good actors and some very well done scenes (I was particularly impressed by Eden Brolin- -it seems the Brolins may be getting better with each generation.) However, you must suspend disbelief almost entirely, as the show's plot really doesn't stand up to any sort of analysis.",2017
4,"utter crap. It is so cheap. The characters have no development.I know its a sci-fi show, but it is so unrealistic in terms of the characters behaviors and it really doesn't make much sense. It has no suspense and a really poor pace. BLAND BLAND BLAND. It copies shows like stranger things and the x files. It's SO cheap. The pilot starts off good but after halfway it just gets really bad and the pace is just terrible for someone who's just woke up from a coma of 12 years. I felt generous in giving it a 4/10 for the acting which for most of the actor's was pretty good, especially considering how bad the show is. It really disappointed me, I had such good expectations for Beyond, but it fell through and has let me down. Anyone who actually enjoys this show has really poor taste. I feel bad for most of the actor's who have to go around and try to promote this crap. I doubt it will even get renewed for a 2nd season.",2017

The other question is how did him sustaining a head injury affect all the people around him. Nobody but his mom and dad have one normal reaction. The jerk who served him a beer in the bar looked like he was trying to pick up a cobra. Nobody makes any real attempt to explain anything. Half way through the second episode I packed it in. Can't watch any more. ",2017

The show's logic is completely illogical, the plot is very boring and predictable SPOILER ALERT!!!! A 13 year old kid falls in a coma for 12 years all of a sudden wakes up and develops superpowers from thin air because he was in a coma now everybody wants him on their side. Now he is a 25 year old man who is confused about women (likes one, loves another and sleeps with another) There were no memorable scenes, every aspect of the show is forgettable. In general very poor show.",2017

4,"I've been a fan of Star Wars for a majority of my life, and this was a major let down. The story is mediocre at best, with clich√©s and useless characters riddled about. The story is nothing more than a fickle teen running around with her pals trying to get the plans for the Death Star. It has a few bright moments with their reprogrammed droid, K- 2SO, being the only good character out of the whole movie. The action scenes fall short, and are more inclined to have something explode rather than show the tide of a battle drastically change within a second. As for the Death Star, well, it honestly only needed to be used once. But no, go ahead and destroy a key base which has all of your plans, most of which most likely don't have any back ups. I'm sure the Emperor won't mind losing key military schematics. Then the movie fails to even get the menacing Lord Vader's look right. Episode 3 did it well enough, you can do it too Disney. This movie was an eye opener, critics had nothing but praise for this movie, yet all I see is a big step in the wrong direction.",2016

I saw the original film 4 times the same day and twice the next day in 1977, I was hooked! Story-characters-caring- being immersed in the film, all this is lacking in Rouge One . I could care less about the characters. No real plot. No passion. My Grandmother could have directed better. No emotion. No development. Simple eye candy. At least JJ Abrams put some passion in EP 7. Disney needs to have screenwriters and directors with commitment to the fans do these films, or destroy the myth. If you HAVE to see it, go to the early show at the $2 cinemas.",2016

Remember when it got out a year ago and everyone was super excited and enthusiast? Same thing's going to happen to these 2hrs of bore printed on celluloid : wait for the hype to disappear, be honest with yourselves and acknowledge that this piece of crap film is just another fanboy scam, especially designed to rob kidults of their hard earned cash. Then watch the ratings drop to a more realistic 5, tops. And -surprisingly-, this farce is presently rated above 8. In 6 months, no one will care. So please, childish people that can't read and that don't watch movies that got out before 2k because they don't have computer graphics in them, try to stay objective when rating a film.

It has gotten so many rave reviews and I desperately wanted to feel the same way. After some time since its release and the adrenaline rush has worn out, I can honestly say that it was a big disappointment for me as a Star Wars fan.

1,"I just spent 2 hours trying to stay awake in the movie theater. Not only is this movie boring but it is a complete and total rehash of the original 1976 Star Wars. So much so that I recognized shots that were in the first movie (that were better in the first movie because Harrison Ford was in them!). I want to save people from wasting over 2 hours of their life like I just did. Just see the original and skip this completely. The original has interesting characters, humor, suspense and actors who can actually act. This was void of all of that. The characters were shallow and unbelievable as was the plot line (and lack there of). There was basically no story in the first hour and a half of this movie. And might I ask, who would adopt a child, raise it for 8 years only to abandon said child because they were afraid someone figured out who she was (they couldn't be that much of a threat if it took them 8 years to figure it out). I am now done with the Star Wars franchise. Chanting that you have the Force doesn't make it so. Spoiler, there is a Death Star but there is a way to destroy it (size may very depending on which Star Wars you are watching but otherwise that is the plot of all of the Star Wars movies). I'll just leave you with this, If you have the technology to build a planet sized spaceship that can distroy planets why do your schematics need to be on a floppy disk?",2016
3,"I agree with the review that says Rogue One is the end of an era, but  for another reason. Honestly, I have watched the original installments  and liked them so I was very disappointed with The Force Awakens  Episode Seven, but my disappointment here is for another reason. This  is the first Star Wars movie with no Jedi, light sabers or any real  force. I know the Asian dude keeps saying he has the force, but of  course it is a wish on his part. He is not Jedi or padavan and the  force does not surge within him. A Star Wars film without force, Jedi  or light saber is not really Star Wars is it. Some might say that with  what happened in Episode Seven maybe that is a good thing, but I prefer  to think there is certain elements that are a must for Star Wars. Also,  in case anyone didn't notice the film does not start with a rolling  storyboard.  I guess Disney needs the money, but honestly we are the ones giving it  to them.",2016

Some differences were somewhat striking, but overall it absolutely felt like a Star Wars movie should feel. Lots of familiar faces to see, super tense and exciting and beautiful.

Bennett and Ferguson also acting very well, which all adds (to my opinion) to a great film. And to all the men that say it's a ""men hating"" film, I say that you really have a low self-confidence to come up with such a statement...

Having not read the book, I can't say whether the book is suspenseful but the film has less drama than the current Southern rail conductors strikes.

In the jig-saw puzzle style, Taylor has Emily Blunt, Haley Bennett, and Rebecca Ferguson in a trio of decent performances. The story could be a bit overlong, and somewhat far-fetched in some character reactions and scenes, but I enjoyed the old-school mystery. You have to swallow disbelief in the idea that Blunt's character juxtaposes her recollections of how she acts. Alcohol is a ready-made explanation for this, but anyway, if you're looking to poke holes in the story, you could.

I also liked Halet Benett character, she's a good actress with a bright future, I've seen her this year on ""The Magnificent Seven"" too.

Some other reviewers complain about plot points that don't make sense but, in some cases, it's because the reviewer did not understand the plot and the inter-relationships of the characters. Special credit to Emily Blunt and Haley Bennet for portraying the angst in their personal situations.",2017
2,"After seeing Gone Girl, I left the theater angry and a bit shaken. The movie reminded me how unfair our society is, where people can get away with accusing others of wrong doing, and ruin the lives of said people by just stating, ""He did that to me!"". It was a well made film that evokes the feelings of the times we are living in, where a persons belief and emotion is more important than facts and data. This film, The Girl on the Train, made me angry as well, but for all of the opposite reasons. Again, we have a film where the man is automatically the villain, and all of the women victims. This man-hating spectacle is intensified by having one man ultimately responsible for ruining the lives of not just one person, but 5! The women had nothing to do with it, they were all innocent, and none of them did absolutely nothing to deserve their fates.",2016

So, last night , a friend and I , had the misfortune of viewing ,The Girl on the Train ... To tell the truth , I've seen better mysteries on ""Murder She Wrote "" reruns !! Pathetic characters , nasty sex , thrown in every couple of minutes , and I for one, am SO sick of F this F that , every other word ! Personally , my contemporaries, and I do not use trashy language ,and we are sick of vulgar conversation ,in this and other films ,of recent years !, I guess next time ,I'll just stay home and watch TCM !! Great movies , with great plots , great actors and NO trash !! I seriously, would have left after the 1rst 45 min. , if I would have been alone !, Oh , and by the way , I would give this film an X rating ! May appeal to some ....

1,"At first I thought this going to be something different. Shrouded in mystery and so on but boy was I wrong. In the immortal words of John Belushi: ""But noooooooooooooooooooooooooo!"" When I think of this movie I think about what Chris Rock said at the Oscars this year about our ""friends"" in Hollywood: ""These are nice people, you know liberals.""",2016
8,"Emily Blunt totally deserves an applaud for her acting. She has delivered an masterpiece. This thriller is atmospheric and suspenseful, like the best-selling Paula Hawkins novel it's based on. Emily carries the weight of Rachel's alcohol dependency, an awful cocktail mixed with grief and self-hatred. Its heroes and villains are painted with a one-dimensional brush, either evil and angry, icy, or simply a big hot mess.",2017
1,"I've never written a review on here before but this was so incredibly disappointing. Every nuance and detail that sucked you into the story while reading the book has been erased and instead been replaced with clich√© Hollywood hot actors continuously keeping at gratuitous eroticism when the original was a bleak and hollow tale about human relation. This entire film just tries so hard to be sexy and edgy as a marketing ploy I'm suspecting but this was a bona fide mess. The stiff acting, the weird casting ( the therapist- wtf?), the weird sexual undertones, and please let's not even begin to start thinking about the writing. Shallow, unrealistic, and lazy. Plain lazy. This was horrible. Read the book- trust me.",2016

Emly is a divorced, confused woman, She is living with no one in a home. She drunk all time. She went to city by train and everyday she looks toward her ex husband home. There the actual story start. My personal advice is don't waste your time. Just watch it at home if you love blunt eyes. ABCD................................ CDE................................ FGH................................

I even saw the cinema listings. But for some reason the movie never really registered with me. I saw no ads or trailers anywhere and subsequently I had no idea what the movie was all about either; it was just quietly sitting on the shelf so to speak.",2016
1,"Utter waste of time. The villain is an angry woman's ideal bad guy: he's a violent, disrespectful liar who ""can't keep it in his pants."" Quote. So once revealed, you know he needs killing. And in a gory, on-screen way. How about a corkscrew to the throat? Sounds perfect. And how 'bout a couple of his victims teaming up? Check. Sisterhood is beautiful. Guys are hideous. Sure sounds like the stuff that'll have them lined up at the box office. Maybe the book was good, but this film sure ain't. Is this a new generation chick flick or just a angry woman's revenge fantasy? According to IMDb figures, it's already covered production costs. Too bad. We don't need to inspire more ""entertainment"" like this.",2016
9,"We knew already that Mel Gibson is a filmmaker with a powerful vision and the craftsmanship to go with it. Extraordinary battle scenes. Violence, Gibson style, which means Peckinpah plus, because here there is such a personal intention that makes every frame, utterly compelling. The only drawback and I have to say it, Vince Vaughn. Why? In the moment he appears, this extraordinary film becomes a movie. It took me completely out of it. When you look at him you see an actor, acting. On the other hand, Andrew Garfield. Sublime. He makes totally believable a character that could be fictional. The humanity in Andrew Garfield's eyes makes everything real. It tells us, in no uncertain terms, that at the very center of it all, there is love. Love!",2017
8,"I was lucky enough to sneak into a cast & crew screening at the Newtown Dendy cinema. I thought 10.30AM on a Sunday was too early for a Mel Gibson movie, that I might be in for something along the lines of the heavy-handedness of THE PASSION OF THE Christ, and the adrenaline pumped brilliance of APOCALYPTO.",2016
10,"When thinking about war films, it's very hard not to go straight to the classics such as Apocalypse Now, Platoon or Saving Private Ryan. You have to make something very special to be mentioned in the same sentence as films like those and in Hacksaw Ridge, I think Mel Gibson has made one of the all time great war films.",2016
9,"Just watched this movie at the pre-screening and feel like I owe it to the creators to write a review. Having read other reviews, it is hard to stay original, so first are few thoughts that I shared with the others. Great to have Mel Gibson back in the directors seat. I will be surprised if we don't see this film in a few Oscars categories. Now, few thoughts of my own. The movie depicts brutality of war in gory details, so much so, that I had to turn my eyes away from screen couple of times. However, I do understand why this was important to the story line. It was done so that we could truly appreciate Doss's act of bravery, feel it like we were there and witnessed it firsthand - nothing was left out. The story grabs you from beginning and does not let you off until very end - after the movie I turned back and half of the girls in the theater were still wiping tears. Bottom line - instant classic that will find it's place on the shelf next to the likes of Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers.",2016
9,"As someone from Sydney, Australia I was proud at the way this was filmed. Using the Hollywood model, there would have been lots of sets but using actual buildings allowed a lot of warmth to come through in the natural light. Gibson is a fine director, I was impressed with his framing, he shoots very closely for the acting stuff (more head and shoulder) which is quite interesting on the eye. Using more natural light it is quite beautiful. I suspect Gibson will not yet have been forgiven for his personal life to get the recognition he deserves.",2016
9,"I was fortunate enough to see an advanced screening of HACKSAW RIDGE in Hollywood and was impressed. The screenplay is authentically-driven to the last detail and portrays the horrors (and prejudices) of wartime conduct. I knew we were watching an epic film when at the conclusion, the audience was stunned so much so that the applause was delayed.",2016
10,"Hacksaw Ridge is not a film for the feint-hearted. Right away the opening scenes portray the horror of war, and the emotional journey is only beginning as the audience is led through the story of war-hero Desmond Doss. One of the great feats of storytelling from Mel Gibson (director) and Andrew Garfield (leading role, Desmond Doss) is to lead the audience along Doss' journey with a feeling of having experienced the journey as Doss, and experiencing the wide range of emotions endured by this heroic character along his journey.",2016
9,"Hacksaw Ridge is the latest film from the infamous Mel Gibson and it is as electrifying as one would come to expect. Telling the story of Desmond Doss, an Army medic that refused to carry a weapon through the hell fire of battle in Okinawa at the height of World War II. The untold story of Doss is one that is of the finer war hero stories that anyone could tell. Starring Andrew Garfield, Vince Vaughn, Sam Worthington and Teresa Palmer, Hacksaw Ridge is a beautifully acted and viciously portrayed war film that will stick with you from the minute the film starts until the second the end credits start. It will leave you clawing your seat, wiping away the sweat from your palms as we see Garfield's Doss save as many lives as he possibly can while dodging bullets and hand grenades. The film starts in the most somber of times in American history, the second world war. Desmond Doss, the son of a PTSD-riddled alcoholic Army man (Hugo Weaving) who served in World War I, is also as much as a devout Christian as he is a patriot, leading him to join the fight against the oppressive Japanese military. Doss is in love with a small town girl Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer) who is scared that she'll never see Doss again, especially after the persecution he is sure to face. When in training camp, Doss refuses to touch a gun and is actually court marshaled for his refusal. This leads to a trial in which he is allowed by his superior officers to go into Okinawa with no fire arm to protect him. Much of the film is steeped in realism, something that Mel Gibson specializes in when it comes to violence. While the story and plot line may sound very traditional, the way it is portrayed is a fresh burst of life into a tired genre such as this. That, coupled with the amazing true-life story of Desmond Doss being portrayed on screen, makes Hacksaw Ridge a wild and brutal trip down the path to Christianity and the power that faith can give a man. Gibson, a devout Catholic himself, would be the director to bring this story to life. His religious views seep through his very being, especially through his films and this film is no exception. The film settles in the idea that God is literally protecting Doss, not only physically but spiritually as well. Doss is constantly tested throughout the film, almost needing to take a life (which is the ultimate sin to him) in many scenes. The fact that this man did not fire a single round and saved as many men as he did is astounding and the film really does an amazing job at showing the harsh realities of war but also showing the good that can be brought out in a man through his faith. The film itself, is one of Gibson's less preachy works which makes it more accessible. Even if faith-based films are not your thing, you can appreciate the craft that went into making this film. Hacksaw Ridge displays war as atrocious as it truly is. There is blood, there is gore and there are a couple wounds that will cut even the strongest of men down. This is an extremely violent film but it is extremely violent in the sense that there is enough going on around us to never make us truly settle in the violence which would take away a lot of the impact that Gibson is trying to portray. The film is paced very nicely and does feel more like a traditional war film without it really being the traditional World War II film. The filmmaking is traditional but the story is unique and is definitely the driving force to run out and see this film. The performance from Andrew Garfield is amazing. He sheds any sort of preconceived notion and really embodies the roll of Doss quite well. He is far from a revelation but he is on the right track in delivering a very fine performance. The screenplay is tight and taught. Like I said, there are scenes that are heart pounding in this film. Personally, I found myself holding my breath during some of the action sequences. It was THAT intense at parts. While I do have great things to say about this film, I will say, I was a bit disappointed in the performances all around. While I thought Garfield did an amazing job carrying a film that was not Spider-Man, I wish he was a little better. I felt the same way with the rest of the cast. The melodrama that is portrayed very early on in the film is something that does begin to corrode the realist efforts of everything else. However, once the action starts, so does the really great acting on everyone's parts. Gibson is an actor that revels in the moments of pure chaos and he expects the same thing from his actors. It makes for some intense scenes that are elevated by the pure realism that the actors portray. You actually feel as though you are watching these people go to war. It is a testament to Mel Gibson as a director. He really knows how to put you in the moment and Hacksaw Ridge just solidifies his talent. Overall, I felt Hacksaw Ridge was an extremely brutal and visceral war film that brings up questions of warfare, humanity and religion while displaying Gibson's excellent eye for technical accuracy and assaulting imagery. Say what you will about Gibson as a person but as a director he is sharp, gritty and a master at what he does.",2016
8,Good war-films can be very disturbing to watch. The dramatic realism of modern digital effects spares little and many audiences will find Hacksaw Ridge (2016) one of the most violent sensory assaults that can be experienced in a cinema. If it were not a true story that celebrates an unusual hero the film could have been accused of a gratuitous display of unrelenting carnage and military triumphalism.,2016
9,"For well over a year now I have been waiting with baited breath to see this movie. I have been a fan of Desmond Doss from a child. Having the privilege of the movie being filmed in my neck of the woods, and even getting to watch some of the scenes being filmed and meeting Mel in the process (ever so briefly), escalated my enthusiasm. When you are that pumped and euphoric, you are usually deflated when the moment finally comes¬Ö but not this time.",2016
10,"War films can be a bit hard to sit through, with its graphic depictions of key battles in history, strong themes of power, brotherhood and the effect it has among the world but with Mel Gibson's latest war drama 'Hacksaw Ridge' it manages to be something more that we can grasp it.",2016

Those who have been to war thought they were incredibly cartoon-ish.",2017
2,"If you're looking for a puff piece that will reinforce your lack of knowledge about war and strengthen your already crystallized belief in the Christian faith, then this is the movie for you. Poorly scripted and filled with exaggerated stereotypical clich√© lines and images, this will thrill the war-mongering, Christian right. ",2017
1,"This is a sweet movie. It's very very sweet. In fact, it's so sweet that you can almost see the syrup dripping from the screen. And don't get fooled by the colors. This movie has a more black/white feel to it, heaven or hell, good or bad, etc etc.",2017
1,"I wonder what veterans of the battle had to say after watching this movie. There are many moments in this movie that make it look like Marvel's story. Unbelievable. Was there really only ONE rope ladder to climb for ALL American troops? Was there some kind of treaty with Japanese not to touch the ladder and let Americans climb till they reach the top and prepare for an attack? Everyone was just waiting for our hero to finish, ALONE,saving his wounded comrades? I used to respect Mel Gibson's work. Not anymore.",2017

Truman for single-handedly saving the lives of over 75 of his comrades while under constant enemy fire during the Battle of Okinawa in World War II. If you've seen Braveheart you know that Gibson is one of the few directors who have mastered the art of film making. If you want further proof than look no further, As this is a another fine example of his work. What stands out even more then the story line is Garfield's extraordinary performance. I wouldn't be surprised if he won his first academy award from this. As he is the heart and soul of this movie, perfectly cast. Honestly, I'm not the biggest fan of biographies and I rarely make exceptions. However when I heard that Gibson was overlooking this, I was ready to make that exception and I'm glad that I did. As this might win him his third academy award.",2016
1,"After reading many positive reviews here and elsewhere, I was eager to see this. But to my surprise this turned out to be one of the most overrated movies I've ever seen.

I really have no clue how people can rate this highly. A total disaster of a movie!",2017
1,"I saw Hacksaw Ridge last night here's my opinion....

4,"Great graphics and high budget, of course. The standard boring music doesn't even matter, after you notice the big bad problem: there is no scenario, absolutely no intrigue or plot, nothing actually happens, there are no negative characters, there is no actual threat or problem to be solved, no twist, no surprise, nothing. So: boring. Predictable. Heroic. Anachronistic. Full of clich√©-s. No plot whatsoever. Poor simple guy has small childhood trauma, grows up to be a fine man, goes to war, is a hero. Now, this might be a summary of a great movie; but in our case, it is everything you will find out in this one. There is, literally, nothing else. I am afraid of saying unrealistic as well, because the character was probably pretty much as depicted. Still, the portrayal is anachronistic, quite false. In fact, we have this huge powerful invading American army, smashing through all defenses of the small bad sadistic Japs (as expected) (no surprise here) (difficult to sympathize, but anyway, need to have some baddies around). And here we have an unarmed winning hero saving the poor lives of the poor victors without consideration to his own life, while his mates massacre their enemies all around, and supporting through his actions the whole round massacre, for a not-really clear reason. I mean, we love Gibson and he managed to do some great clich√© heroic movies, so I was expecting more from this one. Just ain't.",2017

1,"It's truly maddening that IMDb's rules demand a minimum of one star to be awarded to any movie; there should be a special clause put in place, just for over-hyped monstrosities like Hacksaw Ridge. Safe to say, if I were given the chance, I wouldn't be gracing this ode to racism and gender inequality snuff movie with one iota of a merit. ",2017
7,"That the movie succeeds is a credit to Hunnam, who comes of age both literally and figuratively in this movie with a performance of great humility, charm, and grit.

2,"*****Spoiler Alert**** I was really looking forward to this film, as how can the exploration of the Amazon be anything other than amazing? Well I was wrong, this was utterly boring, excruciatingly dull and just plain awful. I can only give it a 1 out of 5 rating. After the first 30 minutes I was looking at my watch and wondering if I should bother, as I had more important things to do, like clean the oven. How can anyone make the exploration of the Amazon so tedious? This could have been like real life Indiana Jones! There was absolutely no sense of danger at any point, just flat as a very thin pancake. The film should really be re-named The Lost City of Zzzzzzz.",2017

5,"Percival Fawcett - intrepid explorer, whose exploits into charting the Amazon jungle in search of a mystical ancient civilization captivated the world and inspired a generation of adventure writers - would probably fall asleep during his own dour, flaccid biopic. Now, this isn't to say the only way to cinematically interpret Fawcett's life would be to whip-crack into full-blown Indiana Jones (though a film this allergic to fun could do far worse than shallow, Romancing the Stone mimesis). Instead, director James Gray strives to tap into Fawcett's mythos and mystique with the lyrical, abstract profundity of a Terrence Malick or Werner Herzog (indeed, his telling is irreconcilably indebted to Herzog's own parable of jungle madness, Fitzcarraldo). Sadly, he's too clumsy a director to commit to the kooky poetry of his thematic earmarks. Instead, his lolling sequences of Fawcett's crew wandering through the jungle or circumnavigating stuffy British Geographical Society politics - amazingly, equally drab and aimless - at times pleasantly hypnotic, but threaten to turn proceedings into The Lost City of ZZZzzzzzz. ",2017
1,"What was probably an incredibly interesting story has been turned into an incredibly dull film. Charlie Hunnam's Fawcett is as flat as roadkill and Robert Pattinson might as well have stayed at home in bed for all he brings to the tale. As for Angus Macfadyen; he obviously thought he was in a different movie entirely. Three times during this film Fawcett travels to the Bolivian jungle yet we barely learn anything about the place or his expeditions. The director skips hastily from one badly written scene to another with all the depth of a Stephenie Meyer novel. This film is an episodic series of set pieces, many of which should have been left in a heap on the cutting room floor; the entire WW1 sequence brings absolutely nothing to the story except filling quarter of an hour of screen time with clich√©d dialogue and hackneyed visuals. With Fawcett's final trip to the jungle you might think that the fabled Lost City of Z might finally make an appearance; you'd be wrong. The film fizzles like a damp squib and then the credits roll, and not too soon either. Snore on.",2017
3,"I'm sad to say that I was disappointed by this film in almost every aspect. It seems to me that the biggest problem it has is the pacing. For a two and a half hour long film, pacing is important to keep the viewers engaged and this movie just gets it completely wrong. It feels like three movies clumsily stuffed into one, and as if that wasn't enough, it adds a bunch of utterly irrelevant scenes which could have easily been cut out of the movie entirely. I, for one, was expecting to see at least some beautiful cinematography, but the movie fails to deliver even in the aesthetic aspect. I was also expecting to see a lot more of the actual journey to the Amazon, but instead we got scene after boring scene in England, where nothing of importance really happens. After about an hour and a half I was left wondering how so many critics found this movie watchable, desperately trying not to fall asleep. To make matters even worse, Charlie Hunnam delivers an awful performance and makes for an overall uninteresting lead. Surprisingly, the only performance worth watching in this film was, out of all people, Robert Pattinson. I'm certainly glad he's moving away from his Twilight years and I hope to see him in more roles like this one in the future. Overall, this was a forgettable, boring, mess of a movie.",2017
2,"The movie starts out very slow with a stag hunt and soon after it is revealed that Hunnam's has no medals or privileges besides rank for his many years of service in the British Army. The British ""accent"" he uses makes Costner's in Robin Hood seem Oscar worthy. He is offered a job as a cartographer to find the source of an Amazonian river. The act would bring him the honor and prestige that he is seeking.",2017
7,"It's one of those labor of loves it seems as the film felt like it was more interested in making an artistic narrative than it was about making money. I can respect that, but it was a boring movie for that reason. ",2017
6,"It's very rare in 2017 Hollywood that we get an epic like The Lost City of Z. Albeit noticeably flawed in many aspects, this film hearkens back to the days where exploration epics were a normalcy in the filmmaking world. ",2017
1,I was amazed to see how many movie goers sung the praise of this turkey. ,2017
8,"I enjoyed the movie - it was a bit paint by numbers but it covered a huge area of his life and his motivations, it was also a story of decline, the derring-do of the British empire and particular type of hero. I think that he has been overlooked because he 'failed' but the film shows how he respected the cultures he found, in contrast to the other members of RGS. The class-based snobbery of the period is also well represented. Highly watchable and recommended.",2017
10,"This is a wonderful film that restores faith in the traditional art of movie making. Richly shot on 35mm by DoP Darius Khondji, every frame feels like an exquisite painting, carefully constructed by a filmmaker at the top of his game in James Gray. The backdrops of England, the Western Front and Amazonia all have interest on every inch of the screen and yet for all this color and texture, it is the characters that leave you thinking long after exiting the theater.",2017
5,"Based on the true story of British explorer Percy Fawcett, who made several expeditions to the lost city of Z, believed to be the remains of El Dorado in the Brazilian jungle. The movie follows three of these expeditions and first picks up his life with a long introduction from his military career onwards. The movie becomes only interesting with the start of his first map making expedition on the border of Bolivia and Brazil in 1906. Based on documentary and field research (pottery finds), Fawcett became ever more convinced that a complex civilization had existed there. The movie then touches upon a second expedition initiated by the Royal Geographical Society that lead to controversy about his role in that expedition. The first World War comes in between before he makes his last expedition in 1925 with his son.",2017
5,"This is a film about exploration, about class structure, about being able to fit in, and about success and failure. The protagonist (Percy Fawcett) has a tainted reputation due to his father being a drunk and a gambler. Percy is a military officer who is offered an assignment to chart the Amazon and particularly the area around Bolivia where rubber production was the most lucrative industry, we learn there was a dispute over the position of the border, charting the area would avert a war between the rubber producers. He accepts the mission in an attempt to repair his family name and restore some reputation. ",2017
2,"It's hard to imagine how this film could be any worse. Let's start with the acting. Charlie Hunnam was great as a m/c thug, but he clearly isn't suited to play a British gentleman at the turn of the 20th Century. His accent comes and goes, but it's his non-verbal behavior that betrays the 21st Century. His co-star Sienna Miller (playing his wife) is wonderful, but the film is almost exclusively Hunnam",2017
2,"This is a intense disappointment. After reading few reviews I was expecting something epic at the minimum for the 2h40min that the film run.... however after the first 45min I was sure that there was no way this films could reach nothing then laughter. There so many clich√©s that after a while you cannot avoid the laughs when is supposed to be dramatic. The plot is interesting but all the aspect that make it special are not explored nor developed. There many characters that seems to vanish without sense and the encounter with the natives at the amazonian jungle are absurd and implausible under the conditions shown. Just for context, Bolivia and Brazil have a significant variety of native dialects ( more then 300 ) this means that many of this areas where not in contact with the Spanish or the Portuguese. The acting, UFFF painful and excessive like in a soap opera. Anachronism in language and behavior... Shame that they miss a great occasion to do something espectacular.",2017

It is so confusing so never see this movie since the other ratings are bogus it seems the film company has thrown a lot of ratings to confuse people , just as the movie.",2017
1,This movie made me want to scoop my eyes out with a dull spoon. The plot moved slower than my grandma after hip surgery. The script was written by someone it should not have been written by. The only redeeming aspect of this movie was when Percy's son grew a filthy child touching mustache.,2017
6,"After being made to watch the trailer for this film a few times before other films I actually had some interest in the lost city of z and this film is alright but I don't really care if I ever watch it again. The premise of the film sees an explorer go on an adventure to find a lost city in the amazon. Charlie Hunnam plays the explorer in this film and he does a great job in this film, at first I thought he was a little stoic but he really grows as the film progresses. He brings a lot of passion an humanity to his character and you do care about him and his family situation. Robert pattinson from the twilight franchise is in this film and he was really good as well, I really liked the friendship that builds between him and hunnam and bought it. Sienna miller plays hunnam's wife in this film and I thought she was a strong character and her chemistry with hunnam was really good. Tom Holland who is the new spider man is in this film and he does a really good job especially when you consider that he is still a young man. Also it is great to see ian McDiarmid who Is the emperor in the star wars franchise in a film again. The story is easily the weakest part of this film, it follows this guy and really his obsession with finding this city without really good motivation. You never fully care about him finding the city and this film goes through a lot of side plots that just aren't focused or interesting enough for you to care. The script of the film has some great dramatic monologues and dialogue that does help make you care about the performance's. However, this film is a complete humourless affair and it does hurt the film as there isn't really a moment to relax. The style of the film has some decent action scenes in it and some great cinematography. But it has severe pacing issues, as mentioned before the film attempts to much and it makes this film a rather boring affair. Overall this is an okay film but probably isn't worth watching if you are not interested in the subject matter.",2017
3,"After watching the trailer for the lost city of z i was excited to see the film. The cast was promising and i'm a huge fan of historical exploration films and unashamedly the Indiana jones franchise. Having recently watched Master and Commander i thought this could be of a similar calibre. Unfortunately the script was dire and the acting was so awkward and cringeworthy i thought of leaving the cinema (which i've never done) there were times where the film felt like a satire, the main character played by charlie hunnam was paper thin and had no believable or relateable character traits that made you care about his struggle. The plot was pieced together and i cant recall a single scene which felt gritty or believing, as you would hope an amazon rainforest set epic would be. Instead we saw a single dimensional poor acting display from almost the whole cast, with Tom Holland (protagonist son and upcoming actor of the new spider-man) breathing a slight breath of life into the film with a more believable and rounded character. The attempt at having a strong female character was a good idea but it was poorly done and not in sync with the usual characters submissive role, not seeming to care of her husband leaving her and their children in England. Overall possibly the worst film i've seen at the cinema, mainly because of my expectations being let down so drastically. I'd avoid this film and wait for it to be on TV or Online and watch on a rainy Sunday in August. I'd imagine if you went into this film with no expectations it could be enjoyable, but unfortunately a big disappointment from what could have been an enthralling period adventure.",2017
6,"I was so hyped for this movie after I read the book. What a let down , this should have been a throwback to the the classic Hollywood epics of the past. Instead it's kind of a bore, scenes set in jungle are amazing but there are too many slow drawn out parts that deal with drama back in civilization. ",2017
1,"I had great expectations for this movie and as an outdoors person was looking forward to adventure and action scenes that would excite and entertain. This movie however was long , drawn out and did not contain anything of interest even though it kept you hoping throughout that something exciting would occur. I think I have seen more action and adventure in a comic book. Acting was good, but nothing in this film will surprise you or get your adrenaline going.. 2 hours 20 minutes wasted,, I gave it one star for the acting,, otherwise it was a terribly disappointing film.",2017
10,"I watched the first four episodes today on Netflix, and I must say, i was pleasantly surprised. I was having doubts of this return / reboot of one the cutest family shows from the 80s/90s, but the show blew me away from the Pilot episode. DJ, Stefanie and Kimmi are back, now as grown ups where DJ needs to raise her 3 sons by herself, and of course require help. Danny, Jessie and Joey are also back, mainly as guest stars im guessing throughout the season. The show starts fresh with frequent recalls of events of the older show, the director even gives us split screen scenes with both the new and older show scenes playing. Subtle funny moments and not going over the top as i was expecting, with hilarious puns and jokes from the older show. The family battle newer challenges with their newer kids like the obsession with electronic tablets, etc Sadly, there is no Michelle, that the whole cast acknowledge in quite a funny way during the first episode! Who knows, she might be brought back in the future. In summary, such a great, heartwarming and funny reboot for the whole family to enjoy",2016
9,"Before I started watching Fuller House, I read a bunch of reviews and was so disappointed that it was getting ripped to shreds that I almost didn't give it a chance, but curiosity got the best of me and I started watching. To echo some of the other reviewers, yes, the first episode is incredibly cheesy and feels more like an homage to the old cast than an introduction to a new show, but after just the main cast of Fuller House is left, I found it actually quite fantastic. ",2016
8,"Like a pair of well-worn shoes or catching up with an old friend, Fuller House doesn't break the mold but is refreshingly dependable: this is truly for the fans. You know what you're getting when you jump in, so if you weren't a fan of the original series, it may not be your cup of tea. If you were a fan growing up or catch the reruns, you'll be pleasantly surprised. ",2016
10,"Let me just start by saying that I rarely ever give anything a 10 star rating. I just finished watching all 13 episodes in one sitting, and I couldn't get enough of it. I'm sick to death of all the negative reviews this show is getting. I don't know how you can be a fan of the original, and not love Fuller House. I went in with very low expectations, and still can't believe how much I enjoyed it. Look, I'm not above criticism. I can't even watch a rerun of Full House without cringing, and though I found myself cringing a couple of times during Fuller House it wasn't bad cringing. The show didn't try to reinvent itself to match today's times. It was Full House part 2. Anyone criticizing Fuller House either wasn't a fan of the original, or hasn't watched it in so long that they forgot what the show actually was. It was never must-see TV. It was fun. A lot of people tend to get all bent out of shape over fan service, but I am the complete opposite. The more fan service the better. I can never get enough of that stuff. If you're looking for callbacks to the original, and classic catch phrases you won't be disappointed. Fuller House delivers in every way that it could, and more. It's nice to see that in a world where everything else is different, the Tanner's remain the same. They say that this was for the fans, and whether true or not IMO they fully delivered. Don't listen to the negative reviews. If you liked the original you most likely will like this one as well. I know I did.",2016
10,"The critics didn't understand why people liked the first Full House so much and they don't understand Fuller House either. This show was great - it lived up to my personal hype! I was practically raised on this show and it didn't disappoint. The mix of nostalgia, the feel, and even the new ""meta"" comments totally fit. As a 30 year old I am right in Fuller House's wheelhouse and I identify with the characters, like I did as a kid. Stephanie was my first-ever crush, and it's interesting that she's where I am in life now too (trying to stay young, be free).",2016
9,"So, I grew up with the original and sure, it was cheesy and dated, but had great characters and a lot of heart.",2016
10,"Attention all Full House fans! You will not be disappointed! I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed myself and how well the writing is. It was definitely a nod to fans with its Full House references but there are plenty of modern day topics addressed to keep it fresh and entertaining for new audiences. It was funny, and cheesy (isn't it supposed to be cheesy?) and heartfelt. I'm so grateful to get to revisit one of my favorite shows from my childhood. I really hope they are renewed for more seasons to come. I also hope the Olsen twins have a change of heart and at least come back for a cameo. Watching all of the old cast members return was like visiting family that you haven't seen in years, their friendship and chemistry is apparent through the screen. Bravo to the cast and producers!",2016
9,"I watched Full House all throughout my childhood/teens and this did not disappoint. Had we watched the original Full House in modern day, of course some of the things would also appear as too cheesy and not totally believable but that's not the point of Full House. It's about watching a family grow into their own and seeing them in all their goofy and over the top glory. It's a feel good show, not a serious drama or even serious show at all. I watched Full House to be inspired by these delightful and naive characters and I still watch it for that reason today. Great job cast and crew for recreating a second generation and for reminding us of some great childhood times spent watching Full House with family.",2016
6,"I grew up watching full house and being the same age as Stephanie, I related to her quite a bit. I loved growing up with the show and seeing it when new shows came out and then when I had my two daughters, we watched all the reruns of it on Nick. They fell in love with the show as well. I knew it was a clean, family friendly show that I didn't have to worry about.",2016
4,"When I found out that they were making this I had mixed feelings of happy nostalgia and preemptive disappointment. While the child in me wants this to make it due to fond memories of watching the original, another part of me was sure it would be horrible. It turned out to be a mix.",2016
10,I am so glad for Fuller House. It brings back happy memories of my childhood. Nice to see my favorite house again full of fun and mischief in bright and sunny San Francisco.Actors have not lost touch over so many years. Everyone does full justice to their roles. Full marks to them for retaining the chemistry even after a gap of 21 years! New kids are very talented and super cute. Kimmy's daughter Ramona and DJ's son Max specially stand out. The new version of the title song is also really cool. Full house fans are in for a treat! Jesse and Becky are still as adorable as ever. Girls though much older look really sweet and glamorous. Danny and Joey still impress with their one- liners and so does Steph! Show has been well adapted for contemporary audience while emphasizing original theme of family values. Hope the show runs for many more seasons.,2016
6,I wish they just started out where they left off. no theatrics. we just walk in on the tanners regular day 30 years later. skip the theatrics.,2016
1,"Fuller House has all the hallmarks of an abysmal sitcom. The comedy ranges from the standard ""adult"" jokes to flat one-liners. The writing is dull and predictable. The child actors are pathetic and unconvincing. The laugh track is extremely irritating and forced. Candace Cameron, along with the other OG actors, are awkward in their new roles. It's painfully obvious that they haven't busted out their acting chops in years. Full House was no masterpiece (by any means necessary), but at least there was decent jokes and heart put into it. Fuller House is nothing but a money-making exploit on people's blind nostalgia.",2017
3,"Let's just get the nostalgia factor out of the way, Fuller House is bad - real bad. I don't know the backstory as to why the show went to Netflix as opposed to network, but my guess is that none of the networks were willing to pick it up - And they had good reason not to. ",2016
2,"I totally agree with the critics on this show, this sequel series to the 1987-95 series is even worse than the original, it's pathetic, the story lines make no sense, the acting is over the top, the writing looks lost and the acting is terrible throughout, Candace Cameron bure looks too beautiful, too sophisticated and a little too old to reprise her role as DJ Tanner, a woman who has lost her husband and she has her sister and her best friend to take care of her and her three annoying kids, the only good thing about this dreadful show is the steve and dj love story, otherwise that is it, this is really bad TV show that will never work.",2016
4,"I only give it a 2 because I get laughs from it for the wrong reasons. This show feels like it's been made in some other dimension. The desperate and forced laugh tracks, the painfully bad writing, the overuse of nostalgia and badly, the annoying characters, the sometimes creepy ""woo"" tracks (like when the brother and sister hugged in Season 2), the stereotypes, the plot lines that were already becoming unoriginal in the 90s, the big huge house with everything but hardly anyone working, the guest stars who look as if they can't wait for it to be over, the selfish disgusting lead character DJ. There is still so much more to say beyond that. When me and my fianc√© watch it, we feel as if we have entered another dimension where only these people exist and feel as if they are in real life but are not. The only real saving grace is Jodie Sweetin who I can almost feel her saying under her breath ""At least I'm working but ****"". Hate-watching it, however, is a little fun. Only a little though.",2017
8,"If you expected this show to be something completely new you're probably asking too much . Yes there is cheesy dialog, yes the parents or ""grown ups"" on the show are embarrassing and completely outdated or at least seem that way, and yes there are many references to the old show. That is what makes this show great. DJ is all grown up raising three boys and soon enough in comes her wild sister Stephanie and best friend Kimmy to help her. It's so simple it may just work twice and for me it did. Updating the humor a bit to more adult, not being afraid to push the sexuality envelope just a bit , and complete two of the nicest possible slams on your cast members who chose not to come back and that is Fuller House. I enjoyed everything about this show and even if the idiots win and it doesn't come back for another season this truly made me happy as a fan of the show. Thank you!",2016
1,"How can anyone enjoy a follow up that only has half of what made the first one memorable, shoehorned in adult situations, practically nothing new to offer and wasn't something that the fan base ever demanded in the first place? Basically, this is one of the most pointless, underwhelming and just down right WORST follow-ups in sitcom history!",2017
3,"A real disappointment. I grew up watching Full House and I was pretty surprised by how inappropriate Fuller House is. In the first episode it looks as though Stephanie became a street walker vs a DJ wearing a dress that was plain trashy. Then Kimmy's ex husband shows up at the party talking about How he cheated on her but can't let her go because of her sexual knowledge ""knowing all the hidden secrets of the Kama Sutra"" or something like that... Lots of sexual innuendo. Kimmy's daughter has a poor attitude and is disrespectful. It's NOT family friendly. I would never let my children watch this show. Aside from it being inappropriate it's just down right corny. Poor acting. I'm not quite understanding why people are giving it 10 stars. It's pretty bad and the humor is immature.",2016
10,I am blown away by this incredible show. Full house was my childhood and brought be through many very hard and wonderful times. To see the family back together and having fun is so heart warming. It really took me back to my days in middle school sneaking TV late into the night just to watch full house. ,2016
1,"There's nothing good i can say about this show. The acting is godawful. what happened? i mean the casts' acting in the original show wasn't Oscar worthy, but still. it's so bad, i saw better acting in Sharknado. And oh god, the jokes sound as if they were written 15 y/o Youtube vlogger. this show is painfully unfunny, i know it's targeted to families, but there are funnier jokes made on Spongebob. And i can't leave out how the f***ing laugh track after every unfunny line makes me want to toss my laptop across the room. Overall, i don't recommend this show at all. Like if you want to watch a family oriented show, watch whatever they're playing on Disney. it'll probably be funnier and more wholesome anyway. ",2016
1,I remember watching full house when I was a kid. I loved it. My children love the old full house. The reason it was a great show was because it was family friendly. The new one my children and I were watching the first episode. And I was not happy with a few things just in the first few minutes. You have uncle Jesse saying they look so damn good still. You have Stephanie's boobs hanging out & her making a joke about how their not a dairy factory while she's holding Dj's baby. When asked about how Dj is doing she shows no sadness over her husband being dead. Horrible acting or bad lines written? And you have hidden adult jokes throughout the show that aren't funny. Maybe it's just me but I expected it to be like the old full house. Whoever is writing the lines for the show needs to be fired. Seriously nothing like the old show. If people didn't love the old full house & this was just a show that came out it wouldn't stand a chance. People are watching it to see what it's all about. My guess is as soon as they see it they'll probably drop it soon if someone doesn't help them improve overall with it.,2016
10,"My daughter was so excited about watching this air Friday night. Me, being a child of the 80's, I loved Full House...but wasn't so sure I'd be interested in Fuller House. The first two episodes quite honestly made my skin crawl. I had to leave the room several times to ""do chores."" I couldn't handle Stephanie, her clothes, what seemed like endless sexual references and of course her boobs being almost entirely out. Then there was a club scene that DJ might as well have been wearing a nightie... I had NO clue what I was getting into and was about to tell my daughter it was way too inappropriate for her. Then episode 3 came along and changed my mind. It took me back to the reason I fell in love with the original. The characters began developing and Max stole my heart. The true display of support for the woman, the kids holding onto one another and the unconditional love of family is something that brings warmth and joy to anyone watching. Idk if it's corny or plain funny, but we found ourselves laughing too many times to count --all the way to the last episode. ",2016
1,"This has been a long time in coming. Many of us who grew up with the Tanner girls have been super excited to see how they've turned out. We've missed the comic wisdom of the men and Aunt Becky. The greatest thing about Full House and all the other T. G. I. F. shows, however, was that they were clean and family friendly. Even the heavier topics were explored and depicted with gentleness and decency. Fuller House doesn't seem to share the same approach. Within 15 minutes there's been swearing, sexual innuendos, references to drug abuse, and actors exposing way too much of themselves. To the new writers, whatever DID happen to predictability? None of these harsher tones are adding to the new show. I found myself cringing and even gasping in shock as beloved characters showed off their uglier sides. I expect this from modern TV, but I never imagined that such a sweet series like Full House would turn so sour.",2016
9,"Title says it all and this got me scratching my head and asking myself, what the heck people want anymore. When I take a look at shows like The Shannara Chronicles (which I finished and don't even ask me why I had do so). with higher ranking, while show had lower production quality or most recent The 100 season, I don't think audience really knows itself.",2016
7,"Colony has a fairly original premise. The characters are at times a bit hard to stomach, but overall it's a pleasant watching experience. I found it well worth sitting through an at times annoying first season just to get through to season 2, which is much more interesting. The character development in season 2 has been quite impressive and they are now much more acceptable heroes and anti-heroes. Worth watching.",2017
8,"Josh Holloway (Sawyer, from ""Lost"") heads a fine cast that includes Peter Jacobson (Taub, from ""House"") in a thrilling dramatic take on what the world might become once aliens have landed and divided humanity into those who collaborate, and those who suffer if they don't. A wall has been erected to keep the huddled masses out of the 'good' part of California, and the stage is set for conflict and character development. Jacobson's character heads the 'Red Hats', the security forces that enforce the division of mankind into the 'regular' people & 'the new elite'. Smuggling and resistance is a large part of daily life under the alien overlords' rule. The parallels between real life in the 21st century & the fictional world of 'Colony' are nicely handled, and the political statement that the writers are making is clear: there already is a division between the haves & the have-nots is real and disturbing. Robotic drones patrol the skies, your neighbors may turn on you at any minute, and the tension is palpable from the very first scene. I liked the first episode a lot, and I hope the quality of writing stays this high. 'Colony' stands a good chance of being a hit if people tune in, it's really well done.",2016
10,"This will be a short review and driven by passion. As I began watching this show I had absolutely no expectations but 6 episodes in I cannot wait for the next episode. This series has a glorious mix of sci fi, drama and thriller, leaving you thinking about the show after watching it (this I see as a sign of a great show) The characters are really well written, taking different paths but touching at key points making the story easy to follow but also leaves you with a mystery. I really really hope this does not get canceled, I need to know what happens next! Please make this a 10 season show! ",2016
9,Can take you a long ways!,2017
10,"I was quite excited for this show and haven't felt let down in the least. I love that it's been a slow start, but that it doesn't spend a lot of time explaining exactly what happened, rather dropping you into the midst of a world under occupation. The inspirations from Nazi-occupied Paris during WW2 are clear, and are wonderful source material to draw from. There aren't big set-pieces or action scenes in the first few episodes, and make no mistake--this is a character- driven drama, but I think that's what makes it special. I don't really get the hate from some on here and elsewhere, and I definitely disagree with those who claim that the show is utterly derivative. I can't say I feel I've seen something quite like this on TV before, or even in films. There are definite parallels to other works in the sci-fi/dystopian genre, but that's no issue as far as I'm concerned. That would be like criticizing a comic book movie for being ""derivative"". I really hope people will keep giving this the chance that it deserves so it can have the time it needs to live up to its potential.",2016
3,"First off, Josh Holloway makes this show watchable (and to some extent the little they are using Apollo Creed). Without either of them and their (slow to develop dynamic), it would be unwatchable at the current pace. Why? Because the Plot feels like another Lost-like ""hey we have all this stuff going on we will never resolve or show you in any way that makes sense"".",2017

I look forward to getting to know their characters. Can truly see this show becoming a fast favorite in our home!

2,"Gee whiz I had high hopes but I was really disappointed with the opening episode. Very slow moving and no lead in as to what the neck is going on. Another, only in California, story. Drama without much substance. The female lead. Reminds me why her character dying in the Walking Dead made that show so much better. I wish I could say her acting has improved but if anything it has gotten far worse. I know this is just the first episode but a good show sets up the story and characters making you wanting more. In this case I just wanted it to hurry up. All in all. Boring, tedious, poor story, poor acting and a waste of time. I lament the passing of good quality TV.

The show has really picked up its pace and I'm looking forward to the rest of the season, I just really hope they don't cancel the show, because I would like to see what happens.

He is a good actor, but my goodness his character is an ass hat. The story to me was blah. It was like I've see this story told before just differently. Emma Stone is amazing. I definitely enjoyed her more than Ryan's character, but that honestly isn't too hard. The movie seemed pretentious and over rated as a whole. It was just Hollywood getting off on Hollywood. Imagine if Hollywood was a person and cloned themselves. Then Hollywood starts sucking Hollywoods dick. There, that's most of the story. White man tries to save jazz. ",2017
1,"**Big SPOILER ALERT** Was looking forward to this film, but had to watch in agony from its beginning as a Pepsi commercial to its ending as a Coca Cola commercial. Shocking that this pallid film is being feted for something it is not. Emma Stone, someone who is hard to watch in long extreme closeups throughout the film and Ryan Gosling exhibit no charisma or charm. Their dancing tries to be cute and romantic but is clumsy. The music is dirge-like and not uplifting. The producers should have used more professional musical performers, ones who can inspire when they sing and/or dance. Gosling talks about jazz throughout the film, but we hardly hear any good jazz, especially not the jazz greats he talks about. So how are we to know what is the great jazz that inspired him? His friend says ""Jazz is the future."" But in reality it's the present, being created as it's played. All of a sudden, Stone, the aspiring actress who shows no acting talent whatsoever, decides to become a playwright without showing any ability or work, except for having an apartment covered with photos of classic movie stars. The banal dialogue, superficial characters and overly long scenes are embarrassments. Stone comes into her old coffee shop and asks for two iced coffees. Immediately a guy standing there puts down a tray with two iced coffees in front of her. Glaring continuity problem there. Throughout the film in almost every scene there is nary a person who is over thirty. The casting people never cared to hire people who reflected the real world, fantasy or not. If the music had been tuneful and clever, the film would be somewhat better. As it is it is dull. he characters exist in a vacuum with no backstory. Only interesting aspect to this film is some of the recognizable Hollywood locations, but locations do not a film make. If anyone still watches the self-aggrandizing Academy Awards, it will be cringe-worthy if this film wins any awards except for production manager or art director. It's a sad state of affairs that this film is considered in high esteem. That accolade belongs to ""Singin' in the Rain,"" ""The Band Wagon,"" ""Gigi,"" ""Oklahoma,""""South Pacific,"" ""Top Hat,""""Wizard of Oz,"" and films by Astaire, Kelly, Powell, Miller, Charisse, Garland, Crosby, Sinatra, Grable, Keel, and all the great stars who truly were musical comedy class acts. Their talents made even B films a joy to watch.",2017
1,This film will disappoint you. Here are the reasons why:,2017
1,"Well done the marketing department for creating a buzz around this film. The first comments I read in the newspapers said this was an uplifting life affirming experience. So how come my husband and I left the cinema feeling thoroughly depressed with the ending. The film was slow, boring and didn't have much to say. The opening sequence looked promising but turned out to be an unconnected piece of entertainment that wasn't repeated in the movie. It was left to Stone and Gosling to stumble along with short bits of dancing and very shaky vocals. Didn't detect any magical reaction from the audience who shuffled out in silence. Don't believe the hype this is a just OK film probably a 5.4 rating would be nearer the truth.",2017

1,"Wow, I just cannot believe all the accolades this movie is getting. The only reason why it must be getting all these awards is that is is a movie about Hollywood, and Hollywood loves itself very much. The acting is vapid, the dancing mediocre, the songs forgettable, the singing abysmal. Everyone sounds like a bad choir audition-- weak, breathy, without focus or ""ring"". No legit Broadway-style singing technique. I cannot imagine what real Broadway singers and dancers must be thinking about this travesty.",2017

1,"I was greatly looking forward to this movie.I had read many reviews and  they all seemed very positive.In fact when I read my newspaper's  critique is was given 4/4 which is unusual. How let down I am. This was  the worst movie I have seen this year.And we saw it in a VIP theatre.It  was so slow moving that I felt myself falling asleep. I kept looking at  my watch saying ""only another 1/2 hour."" Ryan Gosling cannot really  sing & dance.And Emma Stone may be very photogenic & a good actress but  she also is not much of a singer/dancer.There are wonderful musicals  such as The amazing ""West Side Story"",the wonderful ""Grease' Chicago  was terrific to watch also as well as ""Hairspray"" with Jennifer Hudson  & 'Mama Mia"" with Meryl Streep.But this mess was a dud. The plot was  simple but its execution was a dismal failure.I cannot figure out all  the accolades this movie is getting from the Golden Globes,critics,&  user reviews. A few hours after this film,I cant really remember  anything worthwhile.Do not waste your money on this film whatever the  critics say.It is boring,non believable,& you wont really care about  the characters.",2016

1,"Sorry but I grew up living and loving musicals but this is tripe. None of the ""stars"" are of the expected style or standard. The story is grotesquely poor and without logic. Gosling is pathetic, I kept wanting someone to slam the keyboard cover down on his hands, Stones voice left me praying for a good dose of pharyngitis. In short neither can sing or dance yet the Hollywood promo machine keep telling us how great it is and people believe it. In short i wasted 2 hours, 7 minutes and 3 seconds of my life. For our Australian summer releases it rates nearly as bad as Passengers.",2017
9,"Damien Chazelle is a young director who loves and knows movies, from Federico Fellini to Jacques Demy. Hallellujah! Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone go back to inspire us forward. What's more surprising than anything else is the feel of amateurishness in the dancing in the singing. So refreshing not to have a sleek but empty experience. Damian Chazelle' Whiplash was a brilliant preview of forthcoming attractions. I would love to see a thriller directed by Chazelle, something like Shadow Of A Doubt or even a glossy damsel in distress story like Midnight Lace. That's what happens when we discover a new and startling talent. You want to see him do everything. I have a feeling this young artist will.",2017
10,"I was interested in seeing this film because not only am I a sucker for a good musical, but I'll admit to being a big fan of Ryan Gosling and I was intrigued to see what the director of Whiplash would do with a musical picture to make it fresh and unique. So when I had the chance to see a late-planned viewing at the London Film Festival, I jumped at the chance (FYI, Ryan Gosling came to the screening as a surprise post- film Q&A attendee despite not appearing at the Headline Gala the night before so I was chuffed!)",2016
3,What is everyone in this film singing and dancing about? Our story starts off in a traffic jam on a freeway and suddenly everyone does a song and dance number that sets the tone that this film is a colorful original musical about ambitious young people who pursue their dreams in LA. The opening musical number is painful to watch but I assume the story will improve.,2017
1,"While looking forward to seeing this film but having no real expectations, the film was excruciatingly painful to sit through and I like musicals. Being a former film student,I found this film slow, boring, uneventful and at least an hour too long with unappealing characters. At a point in the film, Ryan Gosling's character looks out over L.A. and says ""not much to look at"". I said to my wife, ""my thoughts exactly"" (referring to the film-not L.A.). This made musicals like 'Lost Horizon' and 'At Long Last Love' look like cinematic greatness (and I enjoyed those). They certainly don't make them like they used to.",2016
1,"Tone of the movie wavers between serious and quirky, never making a definitive choice; as such it succeeds at neither. Far too many ""homages"" to other movies to stand on its own. Tries to play on LA stereotypes, but the commentary on them only comes across as ""making sure each clich√© is thrown in the movie somewhere,"" thereby ensuring that the movie itself exemplifies the most prevalent LA stereotype: style over substance. ",2016
1,"The new Hollywood musical with the intriguing title ""La-La-Land one of the most talked about motion pictures in recent years with two of Hollywood's most attractive and popular younger generation stars, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, can best be summed up in a single three syllable word ~~. PA-THE-TIC!",2017
10,La La Land is a triumph on so many levels. It hooks you from the beginning with its big opening number on the highway and has your heart fluttering in the club at the end. Damien Chazelle has proved himself to be one of the most talented directors/screenwriters in film right now.,2016
3,"I'm sorry but I just don't get the adulation for this very bland, very boring musical. I watched it with a lot of anticipation with my partner and both she and I were bored enough to consider giving up.",2017
1,"A film that fails the Turing test - in reverse. Or something. What I mean is that after the first 5 minutes the unpleasant sensation crawled over me that I was participating in a rather sinister experiment, watching a movie made by a computer which was testing me by attempting to provoke a human-like response. Stuffed with algorithms culled from proper movies and musicals, the computer has generated a script and a set of scenarios based on user-preference and targeted directly at my very own demographic! Its eerie; the songs sound like songs but aren't quite, the dialogue sounds like people but not quite, nothing that happens has a real reason or point other than to crank through the plot, the jazz looks like jazz and sounds like jazz but isn't, quite, and the set-ups calculated to provoke an emotional effect left me untouched and feeling slightly hollow. What has been thrown, hurled and heaved at this film is Oscar-seeking acting, Oscar-seeking direction and Oscar-seeking technical twiddling. And hey ho and guess what, it got Oscars. Its the apotheosis of junk food, finally. You don't even need to make the effort to chew; it can now just squirt directly into you via the eyes and ears, a simulacrum of nourishment, over-flavoured glop taking the name of real love, real music, real acting and real life in vain.",2017

2,"In Whiplash, Chazelle's first feature, excellent cinematography, editing, music and design combined with great acting and gripping scenes. However, it was marred by some serious disconnects with realism while purporting to be essentially realistic: some of the character psychologies and story logic were stretched too thin. Ultimately, one could enjoy the acting and the edit/shot rhythms, and forgive the flaws.",2016
3,"Bad decision to fire Erinn Hayes. She was one of the few good things about the show and her character was a way better fit than Leah Remini's. The show's story relied heavily on Kevin and Erinn's interaction. Now that they've removed her, it's just painful to watch. The other characters don't have what it takes to carry the show, and inserting Remini just doesn't make sense at all. What were the producers thinking? Still watching but might stop soon if there's no improvement.",2017
1,Season 1 was funny. ERINN HAYES was fantastic!!! I think it's so lame they let her go and brought in Leah Remini. I loved King of Queens but that ship has sailed. I can't even stomach the show now. Such a shame. They gave a poor performance about how the mom died. I am very disappointed that Kevin James decided to go this route.,2017
1,"Pretty bad. Fat slob, adoring sexy wife (not remotely believable), huge luxurious house = disaster. Three kids, oldest daughter living in the garage rent free having sex with her ultra nerd fianc√©' while the newly retired cop dad gets a job to support them...add a trio of childlike retired cop friends and a fireman brother and you have...a mess. I can see it now..show tanks, in desperation the hot wife is replaced by somebody funny, ....and it still tanks. King of Queens had it all...great chemistry with husband and wife, a couple of friends who were genuinely funny,and the live in father in law who stole the show. This show will never get off the ground despite the Big Bang lead in. I give it 13 weeks at best.",2016
1,"I thought that the first season was funny, though it mainly contained sophomoric humor (what else do you expect from Kevin James?!?). But, killing off Erinn Hayes' character, Donna, was a death sentence. She is what made the show funny because without a good ""straight man"" Kevin James is not funny. I am done with this show and if CBS is interested in making money in this time slot, they would cancel it and replace it with ANYTHING else.",2017
4,. . .for a better show.,2016
1,Season 1 was really great in my opinion. Then they killed off his wife in season 2 and ruined it! I couldn't even finish the first few episodes they were so bad. I deleted all the recordings of Kevin Can Wait Season 2 and I deleted the scheduled recording for the show on my DVR. They successfully killed the show. Thanks CBS.,2017
2,I loved The King of Queens - the writing was brilliant and there was amazing chemistry between all of the cast members. Kevin James is a very funny and talented man and he's a master of physical comedy. ,2016
1,"This show could have been good, but wasn't. The canned laughter is horrible, and was always overpowering the dialogue. There were times at the beginning when this laughter was nonstop. I mean you couldn't hear a thing....and the joke hadn't even been played out. There were perhaps 3 funny lines in the whole 20 minutes. And how old is he supposed to be? I mean the guy has retired from the police force in his mid 40's, what kind of income do officers make these days that this dude is set for life. Oh hang on, he needs to rent out his garage or get another job. What a load of rubbish. The characters have all been seen before, with better scripts. Give this a missed. One star from me.",2016
3,"As others have said, I too was hoping for more of a sequel to King of Queens. I will watch a rerun of that whenever I see one -- and we all know you can catch one on at any minute of the day or night.",2016
1,"I tried to watch the first episode of season 2 today and it is still terrible. This show needs to just be put out of its misery. As a fan of King of Queens this was difficult to watch. Kevin James and Leah Remini are great but the story line is terrible. I realize it was the first episode of the new season and maybe it might improve, but I really doubt it.",2017
2,"Seriously, Kevin is 50 years old and retired? Better yet, he has a wife only 40. And all his friends are around 50. Isn't anybody suppose to look their age? Another thing, they have young kids. The daughter is a college student, son in high school.",2016
1,"Watching episodes of this makes me sad, i've persisted with every episode of season 1 but there's nothing of merit in this. I can't even work out why it's so bad, is it the writing? Is it there's no chemistry between the cast? Is it the characters are one- dimensional? Is it the actors are miscast? Is it the Directors couldn't direct traffic? Or is it the constant annoying inane canned laughter at weak or non-existent jokes? Whatever the problem getting rid of Erinn Hayes, who certainly wasn't the worst thing about this show, and bringing in Leah Rimini to try and rescue this is very sad, you're still left with poor writing, poor direction and the rest of the cast with no chemistry, trying to recreate the chemistry between two actors of a previous show rarely works. Being a fan of countless quality American sitcoms over the years is it me or are the goods ones getting harder and harder to find, so the studio executives are clutching at straws hoping ""Names"" can carry poor quality shows?",2017
1,"One of the most often heard complaints about ""Kevin Can Wait"" was that Kevin James did not carry ""King of Queens"" by himself alone. He had co-stars like talented comedian Patton Oswalt or Leah Remini. Apparently Kevin's wife was identified as the main issue of the show by its producers.",2017
1,"Let's start with what is ""right"" about this sit-com: Kevin James can sometimes be very funny...in the past. This show offers no opportunities for him to be funny - sometimes silly, but never funny. Has he lost it or is it this show. Don't know. The show makes me not care.",2016
1,"Show is absolutely horrible from every angle. First of all there is no chemistry whatsoever. [ between Kevin and his friends, kids,etc;] Not even Leah. There isn't one laughable moment period. The kids are just taking up space. They have nothing to add to the show at all, and the fiancees character should've been killed off from day one! And let's face it, the only way adding Leah to the cast could've helped would be to: bring back all of the old KOQ cast members. Bring Doug and Carrie back. Give'em a couple of adult kids( Not the ones now) and call it The King of Queens. Guaranteed top 5 show after first five episodes!!!",2017
1,"Bad writing, sure. Nothing is funny. Poor acting and poor delivery by the entire cast. KoQ had good writing, good production, a very talented supporting cast (think Spencer, Decon, Richie, Hollie, and many more). And most important, it had Jerry Stiller in the most perfect role imaginable for his fantastic comedy. (Don't forget Stella, Adam West, and so many others as an added plus!)",2017
1,"So they killed off the only character I could relate to and brought back an actress from an old show???? Your desperation wreaks! Erinn Hayes Was too pretty and smart to be with him so I guess they needed a more believable character, but they need to quit pulling a dead horse to the finish line and simply do the humane thing by putting it out of its misery. Time of death, season 2, episode 1!",2017
2,"If you are a fan of King of Queens, this show may be very painful to watch. They TRIED to change it up...his name is different, his occupation is different, the writing is not great. ""Doug and Carrie"" from KoQu's had great chemistry and they played off of each other very well. We still watch the reruns every evening. The actress playing Kevin's wife on this show is dull (VERY DULL) in comparison to Leah Remini. I'm not sure if she's a bad actress or if it's just bad casting. There's zero chemistry between the two characters - which makes even Kevin James seem dull and off the mark.",2017
10,"Why the hate? For whatever reason, lots of individuals feel that there is no room on television for old school sitcoms. Always complaining about the laugh track, or the formulas often times used such as the goofy husband with a strong character wife. I too have felt that way at times, but that is because TV is currently at it's all time best, so many different genre of shows available out there, and the comedies are so much more in depth and it's refreshing to see the new styles we get to witness each week (such as Modern Family, It's always sunny in Philadelphia), but I also enjoy being able to lay back and watch a good old school sitcom with newer material or recent topics. There should always be room for the Friends, Big Bang Theory, Seinfeld type sitcoms. ",2016
2,"This show is a sham. The opening theme song states ""I'm not your ordinary guy!"" He is as ordinary as ordinary gets. The original premise of the show was to be about Kevin Jame's character's retirement from the police force. So what do they do after the first season? Kill off his wife, who was the only bright point on the show, bring back his former King of Queens co-star Leah Remini, and Kevin goes back to work. Completely veering from the original premise. They are trying to recreate King of Queens with another name. Period. Leah Remini looks tired and uninterested, Kevin James falls back on his tired physical comedy, and the supporting cast of friends and family just don't have what it takes to help propel the show forward. They have definitely lost the plot. Canned as canned gets.",2017
1,"I watched part of the last two episodes and was not interested. King of Queens was a good show in the beginning until they turned Carrie into a raving sarcastic bitchy wife. It was the same in those last episodes. If we want to watch King of Queens we can. Doesn't Leah have enough going on that she has to bump someone off a show. I feel for that woman who was abruptly kicked off for something that will fail quickly. As for him, he plays the same character, different job but acts the same. Some of these actors have no range, the same person over and over. Better shows were dropped and they keep this one, doesn't make sense.",2017
8,I think most review Nazis are being unfair to this show. I watched Kevin can Wait and Big Bang theory back to back and honestly this show got genuine laughs out of me. the jokes remind you of sitcoms from a decade or so ago but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. I felt that the daughter's boyfriend was an overkill and a lame way to include the whole millennial / tech savvy nonsense into one character and the writers may need to write him out of the show but apart from that it reminds you of King of Queens and has the typical endearing comedic style of Kevin James. This should has a future in my opinion and i highly recommend it.,2016
1,"After being a big King of Queens fan, I was afraid this show was going to be a big letdown and I was right, unfortunately-in fact it's almost painful to watch-not only is it not funny, it lacks the supporting cast make up Queens that made that show work-it's very annoying how Kevin places so much effort in depicting himself as a fat slob who has food obsession-and really how many retired cops (in their 40's at that) would sit around all day with his loser buddies and act like this guy???-when I saw Gary Valentine on the show, I knew it was trying re-create that Queens feeling but it simply doesn't work-Kevin can wait indefinitely as far as I'm concerned",2016
10,"This is a must see. The writing, the acting, the cast, are all perfect. It is so rare that you find a show with such a diverse cast coming together so seamlessly. Each character is perfectly cast. The writing allows you to live each chactors journey throughout each scene. You do not know who's side you are on; all you know is they are all ""right"" in their convictions in some way. The tension and life within this show makes you feel it as though you are there. Re- watch to find details you may have missed the first time. It is a thriller, drama, comedy, tragedy, and fairytale all in one. Watch the show to find out which character resonates with you ethics and morals. The lines may be harder to see than you think. The cast are living their roles and their conviction is riveting. Thank you for this show.",2016
10,"I love both leads in the show, Giamatti and Lewis are both amazing on their roles, both characters are I want to WIN ALL THE WAY but are broken inside with flaws they both depend on the same woman to try to repair. Imagine you get a TV show about The Wolf of Wall Street, with less profanity (I have nothing against, by the way) and mix it up with and equal opposite as the guy after him, both with money both with power but a big difference, the billionaire came from noting , rise up from a poor kid to the top. and the Public Officer (district attorney) is the one that grow up with money and power but have a hunger to be successful bringing down white collar guys.",2016
10,"Billions has it all! Class, Style, Beauty, and best of all Brains.",2016
10,"Great show (judging from first episode). You can always tell its going to be a good show when the things you remember the most are the characters. The law drama, insider trading, sex, etc make the show interesting but Chuck, Bobby and Wendy make it captivating. I think Wendy will basically be the deciding factor of who will ultimately come out on top (either Chuck or Bobby) and it will be interesting to see which way she will lean.",2016
9,"""Billions"" is fantastic as it plays with your emotions as you are unsure of who to root for as both the main characters, Bobby and Chuck are likable however they both do things that make you say ""Why did you do that!?"" but this is the reason the show is fantastic! Damien Lewis and Paul Giamatti bring the characters to life and I could not imagine any other actors in these roles and will be one of the leading reasons this show will continue to be successful! The writing is also exceptionally good and the writers really help to make the characters personalities and intentions known. In all, I believe ""Billions"" will be successful and if the writers can continue to keep up the good work, we will have plenty of seasons in the future.",2016
9,"Completed watching two episodes of this show and I am all of praise for it. It contains features that excite me to go for a show like insider trading, corporate politics, courtroom scenes and complex characters. It is kind of on the same lines as Suits but an incremented version of it. The pilot starts with building of the two lead characters Chuck and Bobby while keeping up the tempo too. Between the two you cannot decide whom to root for as both have gray shades.",2016
10,"Based on the writing and characterizations alone, this show, right out of the box, would be a 9.",2016
5,"Paul Giamatti is a wonderful actor, so let me just get that out of the way. He could basically stand there and read the phone book and it would be entertaining. Even his small role in Downton Abbey seemed like it was etched into the storyline; everything he does is believable. As for the rest of this series, well, I'm six episodes into the first season and the main problem I have with this show is that it doesn't seem realistic. Don't tell me that Axelrod is a brilliant man, show me. I had to turn it off when Axe was standing on a desk trying to pump up his troops with a canned speech; it came off as phony. I have to admit that I don't understand a lot of the industry terms, so leaving me scratching my head is probably a step in the right direction, but the show lost me when Axe returns to the office after his sabbatical and Wagner stands there and says ""you planned this, didn't you?"" Again, show me, don't tell me. A perfectly good moment ruined by bad directing.",2017
9,"BILLIONS (SHO): It's all a game of cat and mouse, or who has the biggest set of balls in this story of conflict between two very powerful men. The first is Bobby (Axe) Axelrod, the only surviving partner of Axe Capital hedge fund who just happened to be out of the office on 9/11. Damien Lewis gives us a multifaceted character who has enormous wealth which was probably earned illegally via insider trading. This guy's got it all: beautiful, loving wife, great kids, lives in a mansion with a full time chef and can buy anybody and does. He's so wealthy, he can go to the finest restaurants in a T-shirt. The second is the US Attorney, Chuck Rhoades played by an intense Paul Giamatti who is determined to take Axe down. Their common bond is Rhoades' wife, Wendy, (the very cool and very appealing Maggie Siff) a brilliant psychiatrist who works for Bobby as the in-house shrink, performance coach and cheerleader for the high pressure account execs who have self-doubt and are desperately trying to stay ahead of the game and earn Axe's approval because they fear replacement if they don't perform. She's been working with Bobby even before she met Chuck and makes tenfold what he makes. As a result, the Rhoades' have huge conflict of interest issues which prevents them from talking about work. Wendy loves her husband but is extremely loyal to Axe. Then there's the added bonus of the Rhoades' 50 Shades of Grey dominant/submissive sex play. Chuck is masochistic who likes to be tied up. The machinations of the financial world are as complicated as they are exciting and the writers have given us an intelligent show, smartly done. (See what I did there?) Score: 9. WATCH IT. Bonds and Bondage, can't miss.",2016
10,"The only thing disappointing about this show is the fact that our government isn't going after Wall Street criminals as depicted in this great new series. The cast is stellar, the dialogue is top-notch, the story is complicated, and it is completely free of clich√©s. There are no cartoon villains in this story, something that is almost impossible to pull off in a feature film because there just isn't enough time. It's hard to know who to root for in this dog fight.",2016

I've seen a lot of shows that have had plot problems, character development problems, credibility problems, casting problems, script problems, yada yada. But this show takes the cake for BORING because it has been showcased as a compelling drama but it fails. It has ALL those problems! WTH?",2017

4,"The show is about a group of billionaire wall street traders who use quasi legal tactics to make orders of magnitude more money than most of us. There is a DA who wants to nail them, especially the main character named Axelrod. I think they want us to believe both the good guys (DA) and bad guys (bankers) are equally flawed, because the bankers can care about children too (their own, not yours). I think it is insulting they want us to buy it.",2016
1,"With all the glowering reviews, with all the talented actors involved (Paul Gimatatti, Damian Lewis, and David Constabile (of the late ""Suits"")), you'd think HBO could've made a better show. Nope. All you've got is two (!), only two people in almost any one single shot, bickering at each other, and, onto another scene. I mean, who the hell even writes these checks for such a pathetic effort? Or, does everyone work on spec nowadays?",2016
2,"The show Billions is so bad. I couldn't be more disappointed. How in the world did they get Paul Giamatti, Damian Lewis, and David Costabile to agree to this lackluster, forced, awkward show with one dimensional characters?",2016
3,"This show seems to be about how effectively ruthless ultra rich people are. Another part of its appeal is probably the viewers' wish to be as rich themselves and to be able to stick it to other people. The story evolves around people power gaming each other. Don't expect any sophisticated plots or unanticipated turn of events. The characters are one dimensional as those in a cartoon: They have one character trait and motivation and that's it. Real people have competing motivations and drives. People who are unkind to others are not simply evil, they act the way they do because of their world view. The characters in ""Billions"" are not real, they are artificial and predictable as the story.",2017

Overall ,having watched just 3 episodes,I can say it is one of the most brilliantly scripted drama thriller and i hope it lives up to its expectations.Please watch it if you haven't yet.",2016
2,"great actors...should have followed the ""Big Short"" style on reality. seems like they tried to dumb it down way too much. It would be like equating Gordon Gekko with Martha Stewart. In reality, Damian Lewis' hedge fund would have been out of business after one year. His insight were at most banal. I hoped this would be the next great drama, but it was reduced to insider trading 101. Sort of like doing a drama on AIDS, and saying it is transmitted by toilet seats. I would have preferred to see them delve into the Hedge funds use of industry consultants, where the hedge funds get the information. Particularly important for tech and pharma, not some idiotic..aluminum wheels are in oversupply?...no hedge fund wastes there time on something so idiotic.",2016

9,I knew I was in for a good music movie when the first song gave me chills.,2016
10,We saw Sing at a free preview organized by the makers and AMC. I really enjoyed watching the movie with my kids. I appreciate the fact that the makers did not resort to toilet humor to generate laughs. The entertainment was clean. There were no unnecessary sexual references.,2016
10,I have just seen Sing with Hubby and two 7 year old's we all thought it was absolutely brilliant. It is rare for us all agree we all enjoyed a film. In fact this is the only one this year.,2016
10,"We just finished seeing ""SING"", and it is undeniably effervescent and will make you leave your cares in the cinema and burst with youthful glee as you witness the effect of the performances on the little children (and some adults), and the happiness emoted from their actions. IF that doesn't make you want to see this movie...you probably shouldn't, for it will possess you with a spirit of joy that you'll have to later explain why your body was moving the way it just did. This is a great Family Movie that everyone will enjoy, for young and old, 8 to 80, blind, crippled or crazy...this is a must see Holiday Treat!",2016
8,"I went into this movie not expecting very much. I had recently seen Zootopia and Pets, both animated movies set in worlds full of solely animals, and had similar expectations. Sing, however, had much more of a plot than I had expected. The animals go through some real issues and struggles faced by people who own small businesses or businesses related to fine arts. This is a good movie to take the kids to as it is animated, full of songs, and family friendly in its humor. The outstanding cast full of big names in the must industry makes the movie more inviting to parents as well. Overall, this movie was worth the watch.",2016
9,"This is the third computer-animated movie in a row that features actual singing by the characters after Trolls and Moana. The title basically means just about every character is singing something because it's about a singing contest being produced because the producer wants something that brings the people to his theatre, not like those previous shows that didn't do much for his career. Seems like all genres of music from various decades is represented here. My movie theatre-working friend was especially enamored with the gorilla singing a song associated with his favorite singer, Elton John. This movie does show the struggles of putting on a show and possible disasters that happen when risks are taken. I really don't want to reveal any more so I'll just say that me and my friend highly recommend Sing.",2016
9,"I got a chance to view ""Sing"" at a early Pre-Screening and it was an absolute blast. Starring the film was an all star cast, too many to name and they all did a spectacular job singing and acting, the main star that gave me goosebumps singing was Tori Kelly, she can sing the house down. The movie was a feel good movie and it had things for both Kids and the Adults to enjoy. Me and the audience laughed throughout and enjoyed the film, we even clapped when the end credits rolled. This by far to me beats ""Secret Life of Pets"", I thought ""Secret Life of Pets"" was an okay film but I was so disappointed. I Highly recommend everyone to see ""Sing"" when it releases in theaters December 21st.",2016

9,"This movie was equally exciting for both adults and children and honestly, I couldn't tell you which of whom had more in the audience. By the trailer alone, I could tell that this was going to be captivating due to the fact that it was not animals singing but familiar voices as well! They also sang current songs and some older songs during the audition portion but I believe that was truly them catering to their audience and they hit the nail on the head with that one. Each actor/actress delivered for their character immensely and I was shocked to see that a few of them knew how to sing! The beginning was...interesting. It caught my attention (the voice and not so much the sheep) but I was glued once the main character began to speak about his present life. The most exciting part of the movie was the lessons in it which was people will do what they want to do when they want to do it and never be afraid of doing what you are good at! I hope a sequel comes out soon!",2016
10,"So no joke, I bought the soundtrack while the credits were rolling for the car... for me the Mom! I was so utterly impressed, never got bored and thought it was a kiddie movie, never not wanting to hear the next song. Who ever chose the songs they perform is genius. I still cannot get over the vocals of all of the actors, they were incredible. Jennifer Hudson's rendition of Golden Slumbers is soul lifting. We just saw t after the Christmas rush in 3D, and that was the best way to really appreciate it. If your tween wants to see it, this is one you as a parent will love.‚ù§ I can't get over ""Eddie the Eagle"" as ""Mike"", his vocals are beyond incredible.",2017

3,"I don't write reviews often, but my friends and I decided to go see this due to all the great reviews, so I feel obligated to write a not so great review in hopes I can rescue at least one person from making the same mistake we did. It should be said I am an adult, but I'm a kid at heart and I love animated movies. This is the first animated movie I've ever seen that I just could not stand. The creators are getting lazy. You can't just create a bunch of animals and hire big name celebrities to do the voices and make them sing and expect it to be a good movie. Although I don't know, according to all the positive reviews, maybe you can? Here's my take on the movie: it was not funny (I didn't laugh once and I laugh at everything) and it was not cute (I also find most things cute). The story was very lazy and predictable. The characters were very annoying and unlikable. From start to end they are lying, stealing money, robbing, bullying one another, and then lying some more. But hey who cares, because in the midst of it all, they are singing! There's the clich√© stern parent who doesn't support his child's dreams, until all of a sudden he does for no apparent reason. I realize this movie is for kids, but even the kids in the theater were running up and down the aisles because they were bored. If you enjoy quality animated movies with depth and creativity such as Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Up, Monsters Inc., etc then I would really advise against seeing this movie.",2017
4,"Well, I can certainly understand why the Golden Globes loved Illumination's thespian-infested movie. ‚Äã Based around something as universally understood as music, Sing seems to be an appropriate first-time directing effort by the duo Christopher Lourdelet and Garth Jennings (who directed live action before). The result of their hard work brings a passable accomplishment by the studio's sixth ever full-length feature, even if no studio gamechanger nonetheless.",2017
4,"Trailing miles behind Pixar/Disney in the story department Illumination doesn't seem to be able to deliver anything worthwhile to audiences in terms of insight, laughs and meaning. They're still stuck in another decade as far as quality animation with depth is concerned, and this movie is not only no exception it pushes the bar even lower for them.",2017
1,"An admittedly glossy, but shallow, heartless, empty, and pandering mess of cinema, Sing is the 7th hit in a row for Illumination. Because with budgets as low as 631 million dollars, they'd really have to mess up to somehow make their money up and then some. While Minions is god awful, Sing seems to actually be somewhat liked by audiences. Who these people are, I have no idea. But IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes scores do indicate that plenty of people do very much enjoy the film, so let me try and explain to you why I think Sing is actually a terrible, awful, manipulative piece of crap. Have you ever seen The X Factor, and have you ever seen an animal? If you've answered ""yes"", you've basically seen Sing. Structurally, it has a bizarre setup, because there isn't really a single main character as there is...an ensemble of different characters who are all given just about the same amount of screen time, each with their own little side-plots that offer nothing more than vague stereotypes that all fit into the most trite movie clich√©s you could ever imagine. You have the Koala, voiced by Matthew McConaughey, whose business is struggling and desperately wants to succeed at his dreams of producing a popular show, because his dead father worked hard to get him to where he is now; There's the pig, voiced by Reese Witherspoon, who's a dedicated mother of 24, who never got to live her dreams of becoming a pop star because she had to look after her kids. Also, her husband works so hard, he basically ignores her. There's the arrogant mouse, voiced by Seth MacFarlane, who's undeniably talented, whose motivation is purely monetary. There's the edgy teenager/porcupine, voiced by Scarlett Johansson, punk rock rebel, who has dreams of becoming a singer and producing her own music. Then there's the shy elephant, voiced by Tori Kelly, who dreams of being a singer, but can't get over her stage fright, which keeps holding her back. Then there's my favorite, the gorilla, voiced by Taron Egerton, who dreams of being a singer, but is held back by his dad who's in a gang, who robs banks, and is a wanted criminal. Now, apart from them all having the same exact dream of wanting to be a famous singer, what do you notice about all of these characters? Apart from being plain horrible, you'll notice that every one of these characters represents a demographic with a stereotype. Young children have the stupid fat pig character, voiced by Nick Kroll, who's just funny and random. The mothers have the other pig character, who's a relatable mother and, wow, isn't it really hard being a mother? Edgy teenage girls can relate to the porcupine who's having boyfriend trouble, and hates wearing anything with color. Edgy teenage boys can relate to the gorilla, who has father issues, and also appeals to those who want to rebel against what your parents say. Shy and reserved people have the elephant character who also happens to have a really stereotypical black family? Then the remaining characters appeal to everyone else, purely because they're cute or because they have vague motivations as us. Point is, everyone is covered, I don't think there's a single type of person who's missing a blatant, simplistic, unsubtle representation. And this movie takes it to the next level, as well, by applying the concept to the very plot itself. Everyone dreams of being a pop star, it's why The X Factor was so popular. So adapting that idea into a movie makes a lot of sense if you want to capture the most simplistic, predictable, general audience possible. So, the majority of the movie is dedicated to animating a bunch of trendy pop songs, that everyone is guaranteed to know at least one of. The segment most people know from this movie is the ""funny"" and ""hilarious"" audition scene in all of the trailers. Come to think of it, this film is basically an hour-and-47-minute-trailer. It has about as much plot and character progression as your average trailer does. And you can tell that certain scenes were specifically designed to be workable into a trailer. You know what, I don't even need to explain. Here's some videos for u; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBe1hXRNi4g https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiDMJ-MstqQ Your welcome...",2017
4,"Okay, so I am very confused here as to how this film is so highly rated.",2017
7,"Besides Disney & Pixar, Illumination Entertainment has been on something of an animation roll as of late, ever since 2010's 'Despicable Me'. Despite, most of their films, not being hits with critics, their movies continue to make mad cash. Sadly, their newest movie 'Sing' is one of their weakest. Directed & written by Garth Jennings and co-directed by Christophe Lourdelet, the film tells the story of a group of anthropomorphic animals such under-appreciated pig mama Rosita (Voiced by Reese Witherspoon); the gentle son of a gorilla crime boss, Johnny (Voiced by Taron Egerton), punk-rocker porcupine Ash (Voiced by Scarlett Johansson), arrogant mouse street performer, Mike (Voiced by Seth MacFarlane) and shy elephant, teenager Meena (Voiced by Tori Kelly), who has the pipes but not the confidence, all entering a singing competition, hosted by an ambitious theater-owning koala Buster Moon (Voiced by Matthew McConaughey), who needs a hit show to save his beloved theater from foreclosure. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, the way, they introduce all these characters in the beginning of the film, was very awkward. The quick fast jump transitions was just too much. It seem, early second that it was moving, without giving enough time to establish, who they truly are. I really didn't like it. The film pacing was all over the place. Another problem with this movie is how many songs, were feature in this film. 80 songs ranging from the 1940s to 2010's is way too much for a jukebox musical. Because of this, the film's music felt more like an endless amount of swiping through Pandora than a great use of storytelling device. Plus, of the many, many pop songs used in this family film's soundtrack, there are a few that are rather explicitly not kid-friendly, including ""Butterfly"" by Crazy Town, which is subtly, about cunnilingus, and ""Anaconda"" by Nicki Minaj, which is explicitly about having intercourse. So that was weird. Honestly, the movie could had work better, if they allow a few songs to sink in, throughout the film. Instead, it felt more like white noise, for most of the 110 minute film, until the final act. Despite that, I do like the last bit of the movie, where the songs do come to characterization the revealing thoughts and feelings of a given character. For example, 'Shake it off' by singer, Taylor Swift, show Rosita's story arc, as she wants to prove to her family what a talented singer she is. Another is ""I'm Still Standing"" from music artist, Elton John is about someone who was under a negative influence, and who managed to break out of it and stand strong without it. A perfect fit to Johnny's relationship with his father. The same, can be, with 'Set it All Free' by songwriter, David Bassett, 'Don't You worry about a thing' by Stevie Wonder and 'My Way' by singer, Paul Anka. It reflects about their live, and having no regrets on how they lived it. All amazing performances from all the voice actors, even if the Seth MacFarlane one seem the most generic in how much, he sings it, outside from this film. Still, if I had to cut one, it would be, his, since it didn't seem like his Mike character had a personality arch to be nicer. He is a rat in the beginning, and still, a rodent in the end. All he manage to do, is waste screen time. However, I can praise the other actors in the roles, they were given. Each one of them, made it, their own, despite some of their cartoon animal counterpart having some characteristic stereotypes that can be view as racism like having black gorillas as violent thugs or sexism, like one character being ignored by her husband until dressing up in a promiscuous cat suit, trigger him to like her. In my opinion, it wasn't too jarring as it was in Disney version of talking animal kingdom, 2016's 'Zootopia' with its gender, socioeconomic status, and ethnicity thoughts of prejudices and discrimination. While, 'Zootopia' is by far, the better film, since it was thought-provoking and had better jokes. I thought 'Sing' did have some moments that really pull you in. The movie did had some humor that was a bit interesting. Great use of foreshadowing, and like I said before, the characters backstory is what makes this movie and their drive to win the money, unique. Yet, I do have to say, I hate how the film abandoned the competition part, toward the third act. It lesser the pressures of them, trying to achieve their goals. I would love to see, some of them, fail at it and one had success, like any other competition show. Yes, it would had be, risky, but it would be more like it is in life and would show that not everybody can have success. In my opinion, the ending was a little too child-friendly. After all, in true-life, not everything can be patch up with music. If anything, solo success destroy family units, not bring them, closer to together. Overall: Due to a few missteps, 'Sing' is not worth the price of admission. Still, it worth checking out as a rental. It's a fun movie, but it falls short of being great.",2017

2,"I was not impressed with this film at all. It is supposedly targeted at young kids and families, but I do not agree. I did not appreciate the casual, off-hand references to adult content. Twerking (when the bunnies are auditioning to a Nikki Manaj song, swinging their behinds at the audience and singing 'Oh my God, look at her butt'), smoking drugs (at a party/club one of the animals looks at an inhaler and asks ""What do you smoke in this?""), and the underlying fact that one of the animals is living with her boyfriend. Depending on the values that parents want to instill in their children, this movie is questionable. Because young kids are like sponges that soak up everything they see and hear, parents need to be careful and considerate before showing this film to their children.",2017

From the 1st five minutes I was attracted to the amazing characters and the plot. It was a totally different experience to me than any other movie; I literally burst in laughter in some scenes and cried in others; my feet were dancing whenever they sing a song and it all reach a breath-taking climax at the end. The plot brings amazing background story of each character and dramatically shows us how they all overcome their troubles to reach their goals.

I like the understanding the boy and his father came to.

If you're getting tired of TV shows trying too hard to be funny and failing miserably, I think the light humor in ""The Mick"" will give you a place to enjoy a little ""guilty pleasure"". The haters are going to push you away from this show because it doesn't fit their pseudo-intellectual comedy guidelines, but it's worth the watch. I really does have all the ""Uncle Buck"" attributes, so if you wanted more Uncle Buck, you will get somewhat of a reprisal of the show with ""The Mick"".

9,"The Mick I was trying to explain to a friend once why I loved the series My Name Is Earl and Raising Hope but didn't like Trailer Park Boys. All three series are dealing with similar characters and situations: white trash characters interacting with the world. The answer that I came up with is that I felt that My Name Is Earl and Raising Hope were not mean. In fact they seemed to love their characters. These are good people who just happen to be poor and poorly educated, while Trailer Park Boys, to me at least, is mean. Those characters are bad people and the show operates on a kind of premise that poor people are stupid, alcoholic and nasty. I actually grew up underneath the white trash labels. Being native meant I wasn't even good enough to be white trash. So I know a little bit about the people in those worlds. Yes, some of them are nasty alcoholic and/or drug addicted idiots. So are a lot of middle class and wealthy people. Many of the people that I grew up with were criminals because they knew nothing else and had no other real options. Many of them were poorly educated and had some misguided ideas, but underneath all of that, many of them also wanted to be good. They just didn't know how. I'm not saying all of them are like this. I'm saying that there is another side to that world that is not obvious if you have not lived in it. Its not easy to find a balance between not romanticising this kind of character and just being mean and judgemental. Its even harder to do that in a comedy setting. It is built into the nature of comedy that you are making fun of someone and something. What I loved about My Name Is Earl and Raising Hope was their exquisite ability to make fun of these people and love them at exactly the same time. You see something similar in the brilliant adjustment The Simpson's made from underground cartoon to TV short to long running series, particularly when Conan O'Brian was at the helm. It is also part of the basic differences between Jon Stewart and Bill Maher's approach to comedy. There is an attitudinal gap between pointing a finger and laughing at others and being willing to include yourself as part of the comedy, in treating your subject as a familiar rather than a removed object of comedy. One recognises that we are all just a funny bunch of monkeys and the other says that monkeys are funny but we are not. The great advantage to the former approach to comedy is that it leads to guilt free laughter. We can laugh at Homer and Earl because we recognise ourselves in their absurd behaviour, but it feels like we are laughing at Randy and Bubbles, just as Bill Maher wants us to laugh at Donald Trump but not Bill Maher while Jon Stewart welcomed us to laugh at both Donald Trump and himself. There doesn't seem to be any obvious connection between the people who brought us My Name is Earl or Raising Hope and those that bring us The Mick, but the feeling is very much the same. I have no idea why they'd insist on calling this show The Mick, which makes me think of some kind of Irish gangster, Guy Ritchie type of show. I mean I get that the lead character name is Mickie, and some of the other characters call her Mick, but the title seems to have been poorly thought out for the associations potential audiences might make. Still, The Mick is a truly funny show. There are moments when it is actually hilarious and truly laugh out loud funny. Kaitlin Olson, who you might recognise from It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia, shows off a capacity for Carol Burnett-like physical comedy and timing as a white trash woman who is forced to care for her sister's wealthy and spoiled children when the sister and the sister's husband flee the law. It doesn't sound like all that funny a premise but the writing and the performances, particularly by Olson, Carla Jimenez as the suddenly liberated maid, Scott MacArthur as the trashy untitled boyfriend and Jack Stanton as youngest boy, Ben, who somehow manages to be sweet and innocent while also matching the adults in comedic timing, make everything work in surprising and and often truly howling out loud funny ways. There is a sweetness underneath all the stereotyping that makes The Mick a show filled with guilt free laughter just as it did with My Name Is Earl or The Simpsons at their best. The humour is never just mean and the actors manage to lift their characters enough above caricature that the comedy it rarely feels stale or forced. The Mick isn't breaking new ground. It isn't like nothing else you've ever seen. But it is genuinely funny. And how many network sitcoms can you say that about today?",2017

There isn't that much content here yet and I plan on writing a thorough review for each episode, but in short Kaitlin Olsen Mickey gets invited to her sisters BBQ where there she finds out that her sister and her brother in law are involved in hxc fraud and are in some deep sh#@.

I have no idea what the 1-3 star ratings are about unless they just have issues with the actors, the show is good and may become great. maybe they just don't like this kind of comedy, I mean I don't like ballet or opera, doesn't mean they stink.",2016
8,"The Characters... I loved that the characters are not as shallow as they appear, for example, the chemistry between Colt and Heather and how a possibly good thing can develop from a hookup.",2017
7,Some corny aspects keep this from a perfect series if you ask me. If you expect too much out of this series then you might be disappointed. Danny Masterson as Rooster is by far reason enough to watch. The knockout performances from Elliot and Winger speak for themselves. As for the rest...,2016
7,"Netflix recently added the new original series The Ranch to their line-up. The show follows the lives of a family of ranchers in Garrison, Colorado. I really started watching it for the Kutcher-Masterson pairing. The brothers great when playing off each other, but the whole cast is what makes the show a success. Kutcher continues his lovable dumb guy routine from back in the day, but there's an added maturity behind his character which I didn't entirely expect, and Masterson keeps up the sarcastic banter that he's known for.",2016
8,"Its a good comedy , it makes me laugh, and in some ways mirrors real life and turns a lighter side to how things really are in the world , not some fairy tail Hollywood script. True it couldn't be on regular TV, but who really watches regular TV anymore anyway. no reason to when the better shows are elsewhere. It brings quality actors together in a show that normally I don't think you would find them , Your seeing Sam Elliot and Debra Winger in ways you haven't before, and the history between Danny Masterson and Ashton Kutcher shows in how easy they work together on here as brothers, almost like they were real brothers. and like I said before , putting a different twist on things that happen in real life , good and bad.",2016
10,"My husband and I love this show! The jokes are well timed and the cast is great!! We watched the entire first season in just a week and patiently waited for season two. There is always something going on with the characters that will make you laugh or appreciate what they are going through. It has been said that this role is ""below"" Ashton, he does a great job playing Colt. The constant bantering with ""Rooster"" and his Dad is very entertaining. Colt's relationship with ""Abby"" has progressed and we are hoping to see how it will mature. It would be nice to see what will happen with Beau and Joanne too :) This show is a definite must see when the kids are in bed. We are hoping that Season 3 is in the works! Hope to see more soon!!",2016
8,I know some people are saying it's not very good but 1st seasons usually aren't the best. The last episode gave me hope that season 2 will be a little better. The actors were getting more use to their roles and getting more comfortable with each other. ,2016
7,"The Ranch is based around a dysfunctional family of two 30+ year old sons, a 70+ year old extremely conservative (politically) father and a 60+ year old mother. The mother and father Maggie and Beau Bennett do not live together although they are still married and maintain somewhat of a relationship. Beau and his eldest son Jameson ""Rooster"" Bennett work on the family ranch while the younger son Colt Bennett (Ashton Kutcher) has spent the last 15 years trying to make it as an NFL player, after becoming a famous local hero when he won the high school state championship when he was QB. The series focuses on Colt Bennett returning to the family and working on the ranch as well as connecting with some of his friends who still live in his home town. ",2016
10,"(Maybe some ""spoilers"")",2016
6,"This show has a certain charm that develops, but compared to Kutcher's comedic style and timing in That 70s Show, his performance suffers. I've never thought Masterson was much of an actor... he's about as good here as he was on That 70s Show. Sam Elliot and Debra Winger seem out of their element in a sitcom. Her acting is phoned in for the most part. Elliot does what he can with a script that could be much stronger, especially considering it isn't limited by network TV.",2016
5,"I was able to watch all of the episodes - so it's ""Bingeable"" but I only got a few good laughs in the entire time. While a show like Modern Family manages to pull a good laugh or two each episode.",2016
1,"I had anticipated this to be a good show but after watching just part of the first episode I was terribly disappointed. I had so hoped it would be a good one. I have had just about enough of pubescent potty humor from network sitcoms to last me a lifetime. Not only was the acting terrible but the script is appalling. I guess the thing that disappoints me the most is seeing veteran actors Sam Elliot and Deborah Winger do this kind of garbage for a paycheck. Things must really be lean in Hollywood for them to stoop so low. As far as the rest of the cast I did not expect any different from them as this is what they do. I had hoped maybe that it was going to be just a little more mature and adult like. I felt I was revisiting middle school. So sad, it could have been so much more.",2016
4,"I'm in total agreement with a few other reviewers on the choice of actors playing Colt & Rooster. But the worse part of this series is the awful laugh track. I almost keep waiting for a commercial to come on. It's so annoying! I am thrilled to see Debra Winger return. She's wonderful! And I'll go to super market openings if Sam Eliot (the silver fox) is appearing there. But between the constant bickering of the brothers, and the ever presence of beer swigging (who's stocking their fridge?) it got stale as spilled beer on a bar floor, after the 7th episode. Being obvious that it is filmed on the Warner Bros. lot, instead of the outdoors, makes it unbelievable as well. To me, what I anticipated turned out to be just another remake of another sitcom with adult words thrown in to stir up juvenile reactions. Some lines were poignant and very serious, and Wham! suddenly a laugh track that did NOT belong there! Where's my Jon Favreau when you need a great writer and director!",2016
3,"Like many people, I was excited to see Ashton Kutcher and Danny Masterson back together in a TV series. In fact, after reading the plot, it was the single reason to gave this show a shot. Unfortunately, this reunion would have better remain just a wish. This is the first major strike out by Netflix. I don't even know how this show was even made. One clich√© after another, flat jokes and insipid story and characters. Not a single laugh for episodes. ",2016
1,"I couldn't even make it all the way through the first episode of this. From the start, it was campy and predictable. The jokes were crude and not at all funny, and Ashton Kutcher and Danny Masterson's ""country"" accents made me cringe every time they opened their mouths. The laugh track just made things doubly uncomfortable. I really wanted to like this, as I'm a huge fan of Sam Elliott and I loved the idea of Masterson and Kutcher reuniting on a show, but it was so bad that I can't see myself watching any more of it. Another thing that bothered me was how they tried to cram all the family history into the first ten minutes of the show, using a few typical lines. The whole thing just felt sort of forced and recycled - not to mention that the way it's filmed seems mismatched with the content and premise of the show.",2016
10,"After binge watching complete 1st season I looked to see if it was picked up for a second. Gladly, it was. And looked here for other reviews and started my account to leave one myself. I see a lot of the negative ones were from people that never even watched all of the first episode. ",2016
1,"There are tons of tired formulaic jokes with predictable punchlines. Ashton Kutcher's character, Colt spews one clich√© jock joke after another. Nothing interesting in his character: a son who cannot meet his father's high expectations. How original. That's certainly never been done before. On top of this, we are meant to endure anti liberal rants by the father played by Sam Elliot. This is annoying because it reinforces the stereotype that all rural folks are right wing dingbats. How about a rancher with a sophisticated world view? We don't need any more homespun pseudo wisdom, no matter how warm and resonant the delivery system, which is, in this case, Sam Elliot's voice. There is surprisingly bad acting by Debra Winger. Danny Masterson is just playing Hyde from That 70s Show, but on a ranch. Might as well just watch That 70s Show. It is supposed to be live but sounds laugh tracked. There are consistently disproportionately big laughs for consistently bad jokes. I only saw two episodes. I won't be watching any more.",2016
2,"I really wanted to like this, but found it to be crude and not at all funny. The laugh track was really bad too. If that wasn't a laugh track and instead was a live audience, they must have been watching a different show than I was!",2016
1,"Can't believe all the good reviews this piece of garbage is getting. Either those are bogus reviews or this finally explains why Trump is getting so much support down there. One of the worst shows I have seen in a long time. Live audience?? I call BS on that. This is a laugh track, or a prompted audience. No way these lame attempts at potty humour could get that big a laugh. Either way the laugh track is just plain annoying. Waste of talent and time. IMDb just said I have to have a minimum 10 lines of text for a review. What kind of weird rule is that? So I will just say bad, bad, bad, bad, awful, really bad, terrible, not funny, waste of time, bad, bad, bad, stinky bad, please don't watch bad, so bad even my dog would not watch it. Used to think these were good actors, but writing is so bad it makes them look bad too. Hope they got paid lots.",2016

3,"This is a sitcom, but it isn't very funny. The jokes are old and the laugh track is annoying. The main character Colt is a drunk and a failure. The father is trying to run a ranch that is losing money. The older son stuck around while Colt was out trying to build a football career, so the older son has no personality and just wisecracks all the time. The mother is separated from the father, but still has 'benefits' with the father. I watched the first 5 episodes to see if I was missing something because the ratings on IMDb are pretty high but, no, this show is a loser. Don't see how it's stayed around this long. Really this show isn't good enough to keep me watching it. My further opinion--if the father is having such financial trouble keeping the ranch afloat maybe he and his sons should cut back on the nightly drinking and then they would have more cash for the ranch.",2016
5,Tell me if you've seen this movie:,2016
9,"Wow, what a great great movie! The visuals in this movie are breathtaking!! They are so gorgeous! But, besides the visuals there is such a heart and imagination and creativity to this movie. Moana is such a likable, smart, and relatable person. the voice work for Moana is so sweet and so good. The chemistry between Moana and Maui is so great and so natural. The songs in this movie are so charming, catchy and fun! But, How Far I'll Go is such an emotional song and it has such heart...I dare say I like it a little more than Let It Go! The way Moana sings it and you can feel it!! Wow, I just looved this movie and it is great for kids and adults. I will always love it and I wanna see it again!",2017
10,Instant classic.,2016
8,"2016 has been a particularly strong year for animated films. With the likes of Zootopia, Finding Dory and Kubo & The Two Strings all vying for best animated picture of the year, it seems Moana deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as well. It's no fluke that out of the four movies I just mentioned, 3 of them belong under the house of the mouse.",2017
6,"I have been largely unimpressed with Disney's recent animated movies, and many of my criticisms with them hold true with Moana. Looking back at Wreck-It Ralph, Zootopia, and Frozen, it seems to me that Disney is more interested in building a visually beautiful world than building a great story. This is true with Moana. The animation is wonderful. The world is gorgeous. The story, however, is rather dull and shallow.",2017
8,Henny's Movie Review: Moana (aka Vaiana),2017
9,"From the opening lyrics to the final shot, Moana was a fun glimpse into Polynesian life. Reminds me of Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron with its depiction of tribal peoples, people who depend on the land and environment to live. As one of the several catchy songs say, the island gives them everything they need. No need to go beyond the reef.",2017
9,"Moana is a return to the classic Disney formula, the clich√©s and characters ripped from a number of other animated films. However, the pure beauty and skill of the production rises the old story into new heights.",2017
9,"I saw ""Moana"" tonight in the local movie theater. I have been wanting to see it since Thanksgiving and expected the audience to be few. To my amazement the cinema was almost full, and I can see why. ""Moana"" is a fabulous movie--it will certainly leave you crying and smiling. I would imagine most of the folks in the audience now have seen it 3 or 4 times. I served a number of years in the Army in Hawaii, so I was attracted to the movie for that reason, and it was certainly a great movie going experience. The animated graphics capture the magic and beauty of Polynesia, the land and the ocean. And the story is a lot of fun. Highly recommended for all ages.",2017
4,"So I watched Moana and boy, what a lazy movie it was. So full of good ideas, squandered on a passable family movie. And yes, I know it's Disney making a family movie, but it had all these ideas that would make a great story if they were taken more seriously. The premise of the movie is basically the whole world dying because of what someone did and they treat this catastrophic event as an annoyance instead of something actually serious.",2016
7,Oh... my... word...,2017
2,"Personally, I thought this movie was boring, so boring to where there were only a couple jokes I found somewhat funny the entire movie, yes this is one of those more song driven movies that are with very little humor, it also appeared as the people I went with(which one of them was a little kid who was laying on one of our arms for half the movie and it wasn't late either, it started at like 12:50 PM I think) wasn't that into it either. First, about the first hour before she got on her adventure was extremely boring, not much was happening and it was all just her not wanting to go, actually during this time, I was so bored, that I went to the bathroom and took my time(usually I run to get back to the movie) and when I got out, I actually got on my phone and looked at how ""bad"" the reviews would be for this movie, it turns out I was very wrong, it has very good reviews and I was surprised. When I got back in there, a little later it got slightly more interesting after she got on her boat, but it still was pretty boring, I even went to the bathroom a second time even though I probably could've held it. I don't think I've been to a more boring movie in my life, the songs seemed pretty generic and I know at least 1 repeated itself later on the movie. I personally didn't care for Frozen either though which I think is the market this is aimed for. This is honestly making me start to lose hope in Disney, I think they've done messed up TV, and now they're messing up movies it seems. I think it is overrated but that's just my opinion. All I can say is that if you like Frozen, you'd probably like this movie. But if you didn't care for Frozen, you'd probably find this one of the most boring movies of your life. I don't even think it's me outgrowing cartoons, I like cartoons but this is just boring, I think it may be they're all aimed for little kids(probably little girls for this one) now, whatever happened to family movies. This movie was so boring, that I was literally able to tell what kind of plot it has, it has a Hero's Journey plot in case you're wondering, I know a lot of movies have the plot, but it's not supposed to be this plain obvious to where I can tell either while or right after I watched the movie. I also think this being about some fictional religion was just weird, like how were the islanders in trouble when the darkness was like halfway around the world, then why would that goddess be that thing that was trying to kill them, it would make more since if we could've saved 10 minutes by her just saying to give her the thing then and that she was the goddess but no, gotta make it obvious about that Hero's Journey plot, seriously. So overall I wouldn't recommend this movie to hardly anyone unless they like Frozen and I personally find this movie very overrated.",2016
1,"Another typical Disney movie of princess, magic, spells, curses, and CONFUSION. I wont spoil it but if you like musical girlie types like FRozen then you'll probably love this. Otherwise, trust me you will be like whats going on? Why is this taking so long? get to the point already. It just drags and drags and drags. It is also somewhat predicable..you'll see what i mean if you go see this. But i HIGHLY recommend you Don't waste your time and money on this movie. If you really want to see it that bad..wait for the DVD...trust me it isn't worth it. At one point in the movie even The Rock says please stop singing. Two good things i can say. The short story before the movie started was outstanding. Its called Inner Workings. Absolutely amazing and well done. Moana also exhibits incredible computer animation. Other than that IT IS A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. I warned you!",2016
1,"Unlike ""Bolt"" and ""Zootopia"", Disney tried again another musical, i.e., people singing instead of talking. That apart, unlike other Disney musicals, e.g., ""Mulan"" and ""Tangled"", the songs in this film are very repetitive. I lost count of how many time the main character's song is reprised, with maybe slightly different lyrics every time, but I stopped caring after the second one. The explorer's song, one of the few with Polynesian language thrown-in and that doesn't sound like a cheap Western European cartoon musical, is somewhat ""fine"", although also repeated unnecessarily too many times. Maui's and Tamatoa's songs are happily jazzy and unfitting with the film, but helped me to survive till the obvious ending.",2017
4,"Animation is good (except surely not all Polynesians are so stocky and have such large cankles???). I liked the Moana character and her outfit was cute. Maui not so much, such an overblown caricature it was ridiculous!!! My 9 year old granddaughter thought his moving tattoos were silly. She and her 7 year old brother enjoyed it OK, but I doubt if they would want to see it again. I know I don't!! The plot was formulaic and none of the characters (except Moana) were memorable. I don't recall any memorable songs, either. The movie needed a MUCH better plot and more in-depth characters. Go back to the drawing board, Disney!! Some of my granddaughter's old Barbie movies (like ""Pegasus"") had better and more memorable stories!!",2016
2,Disney is such a clich√©. This must be the most over-hyped crap of a movie since Frozen. Was Jar Jar Abrams also involved in this? That's how bad and formulaic this thing is.,2016
3,"A friend and I went with the kids to watch Moana last night. I loved seeing Polynesian islands in animation again. The scenery is beautiful--much more of it, and more vivid compared to Lilo and Stitch. The storyline was typical Disney, of course. I feel like I've seen this movie a dozen times before. I would add that I am getting tired of seeing male characters portrayed as cowardly, ignorant, and/or irresponsible. This movie succeeds in that aspect, which is disappointing. Having sons, it would be nice to see a movie where a young man is the hero. Instead, we seem to find thattoo many of Disney's children's movies feature a heroine with weak male characters around her. Other than the above-mentioned observation and the glorifying of pagan belief systems, it was an entertaining and uplifting movie.",2016
3,"Moana is simplistic plot. Surround a young quasi-islander girl with a big over-weight quasi-demi-god, a few animal ""friends"", a father afraid of going out beyond the reef because his friend drowned? and a need to return a stone to its source because that demi-god stole it? while disrespecting the father/chief? and becoming a leader of the people before the father dies? of which, women weren't allowed to be chiefs?",2017
10,"This film is absolutely fantastic. Great CGI, great story, great voice cast, great music, and all around great everything. This truly is an instant cult classic that is going to go down in history as one of Disneys best. The CGI is beautifully detailed and polished. The sea and the hair of the characters look almost completely real. The story is absolutely amazing as well. It's not only thought provoking, but it also has everything, such as happiness, bravery, poignancy, and it just goes on a perfect flow that fits perfectly with what this film is about. The music is surprisingly pretty great in this film too. I think the writers did a splendid job with that as well. This film is beautifully animated and written, and I can't recommend this film enough for those who haven't seen it yet. I was pleasantly surprised and I think anyone who hasn't seen it yet will be as well.",2017
5,"The positives: -Great soundtrack. FROZENesque, epic, catchy monologues that repeat in your head. Added with Lion King like incomprehensible but fun tunes with a Hawaiian twist this time. -Beautiful and creative visuals. One in particular I enjoyed a lot was the UNDER underwater world where the ocean served as the sky. The striking beautiful blue/turquoise water with lush green islands were treat for the eyes -No silly, typical Disney, forced romances. -Passes the Bechdel test easily",2016
2,First I have to admit I do not like the name Moana. It sounds like someone is moaning. Moan-aaaa ahhhh no I really don't understand some people who have voted with ten stars this movie. It was not fun..predictable ..and not respected a lot the need to challenge. I think there is something suspicious is happening with the positive criticism here...simply don't listen to these trolls talking hallelujah about this movie claiming is it perfection - yes 10/10. I just feel sad for those who have give to that film that high rating. They are fooling themselves and I guess they have issues that need to take care of this issues with some professional help. I believe it is so unfair to see that a non entertaining comedy has 9 or 10 rating...and a fan movie has a low rating...all this makes me think that actually the rating system in here is for trash heads. Great job Disney...hope you stop buying votes in the future.,2016
2,"The most positive thing I can say about this movie is that it adheres to the formula very faithfully and it is not an unapologetic butchery like the new Star Wars. Apparently however, whether because of a lack of creativity or despite it, this film is extremely uncreative. At its best, which is a word one should not use about this film, it's how you imagined it. At its worst, if you've already watched Frozen, Snow White or Little Mermaid, it is frankly boring to watch and may disrupt the fancies of your imagination: I never imagined a girl sailing the ocean with a beefcake. The special effects don't go that far beyond stage play level and certainly don't live up to the reviews' descriptions. This movie has not been released to do anything new, and it's not worth the trouble obtaining watching in the theatre with 50 kids on smartphones around you. Read a book, cook or bake, actually talk to your children and think for yourself, or if you must enjoy some other movie on the same theme.",2016
2,"I hate this Movie. Ironnicly,as I was walking up the stairs and into my seat, I had HIGH expectations. As I sat down excitement and the movie began...I hated the first few minutes. A few minites later added to the fire of my already burning hatred for it. Add 1 hour and 47 mins to that and I'm already clawing my eyes out. I'm gonna make this sweet and short. I felt like I was watching Frozen all over again, just with even more horrendous singing and somehow an even worse script. None of the jokes made me laugh, the best character in the whole movie was the chicken with the only trait as a character is being stupid and vulnerable and the only reason I didn't leave theatre was because it was new year's eve and I had nothing else to do.

1,"This is getting extremely tedious from Disney. Neither in the trailer, nor the description is it indicated that this movie is a musical! I detest musicals with a passion. I am not saying musicals are bad not enjoyable, by others, however I HATE, absolutely HATE them. Yet only Disney does not indicate clearly that their movies are musicals. The other one was Frozen.",2017
5,"So Moana was boring. Not entirely a typical family and kids movie, but still very much in the same vein. It's not very funny, it relies on musical numbers more than it should and those musical numbers are mostly boring or annoying. There's a few good singing parts in it, but it's overshadowed by annoying musical numbers. It relies on pop-culture which is really out of place in a movie that's about Polynesian legends. One of the main characters makes a joke about Twitter in the movie which is completely out of taste and just isn't funny. It's a great visual spectacle, but a poor plot, but would hold up on its own it if wasn't throwing strange out of place jokes and very modern character behavior. I had very high hopes for this movie, and it really was a let down. It was boring, and rather shallow. At best from me a 5/10.",2016
10,"I don't understand the hate for this movie it actually surprised me, I really enjoyed this film. Captain America: Civil War is a descent awesome MCU super action the third film of the Captain America trilogy. To me the second movie Captain America: The Winter Soldier is still the best one I just love that movie to death, but I like this one I love the first one but I just love all three of Captain America films. I thought the cast did a good job Chris Evens kicks ass once again he is Captain America and I look this movie from his point of view. He is really become my favorite hero of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the Avengers films especially Age of Ultron, Captain America is still a guy who has a lot of screen time that it is the focus of a movie and he is still the guy I can take a side I agree with him, I can understand his choices.",2017
6,"A movie can do everything else right, but if the story requires the characters to do something that they would never do, ignores a huge elephant in the room that no one would ignore, etc., then it suddenly becomes garbage because it forces me out of the experience of going along for the ride.",2017
1,"People says: an Avengers movie with 'emotional depth' and 'moral  complexity', and now I have to question what planet they're living on.  Seriously, WTF people!! if this is 'emotional depth' and 'moral  complexity' then Marsellus Wallace is a bitch!   When their operation to stop the theft of a biological weapon in Lagos  goes explosively wrong leaving dozens of civilian casualties and  themselves under scrutiny. It may be that I'm misremembering, but were  there any civilian casualties in the past???   Didn't whole cities go up without anyone even wandering around dazed  with a nosebleed? But the plot needs what the plot needs so now the  Avengers have always blown up innocent people, which leads to 100  nations gathering together and saying: this must stop. And: you must  all be brought under the control of the UN.  While Iron Man is for it, Captain America, who is more Brexit, quickly  goes rogue and becomes a fugitive. This could have then set the scene  for, perhaps, saying something almost interesting about government  control, military might and divided loyalties, but instead it results  in all the superheroes choosing #TeamCap or #TeamIronMan¬ó there are no  takers for #TeamNeither, which would have been the sensible option   WHY WHY they fight!!

10,"Hi,  I saw civil war and I come with good news; it's AWESOME!  Im not gonna spoil one single thing, since this movie should be seen by  only the two trailers you probably saw. Don't watch any tvspots after  the second trailer or whatever!  Im gonna touch a few aspects and rate them.  Acting: Of course it's amazing. The characters we were waiting for were  black panther and of course SPIDERMAN! Both were done amazing!  Spiderman has a bigger role than I personally expected and it's done  with grace. Love it. Black Panther was such a good character with great  motivation why he's doing what he's doing. The acting per usual from  the other characters were great! 10/10  Story: Now where another (let's leave it) unnamed superhero movie  failed this year, and no I'm not talking about dead-pool.., was the  story. Now this story is what I expected from the other unnamed  superhero movie. I didn't know what side I wanted to be on; cap's or  iron man's. I was so conflicted and even while they're fighting you  don't know who to root for. The villain in this movie felt a bit, not  really out of place, but unnecessary in my opinion. But Marvel always  struggles to find a good fleshed out villain except for Loki & kingpin  in the series. 8/10   Action/Cinematography: O boy..If you're an action freak you will love  this, if you're a comic book fan.. you're gonna LIVE these amazing  action set pieces. The much anticipated airport scene is AMAZING.  You've seen nothing, literally nothing of the amazing action that will  bestow upon you guys. The airport scene is in complete imax and has a  runtime of around 17 minutes. Just let that sink in! The Russo brothers  know how to create great action and film it great as well. I can go on  record and say this is by far the best superhero action scenes ever.  20/10.   Verdict: Was it a perfect movie? No. But for me as a fan it came darn  close. The only thing that bothered me were the villains, well actually  one of the few that are in there.   Was it better than... Batman v superman.. yes by far. I mean we're in a  comic book movie year, so we might as well compare it. Batman v  superman lacked in a lot of places and civil war just did it better.  Just the conflict in ideologies made it so much more believable why the  characters fought and because this whole story arc is happening now  after 2 cross over movies, 3 iron movies and 2 cap movies.. the stakes  are so incredibly high. I tried to compare dead-pool with it as well,  but it's a different movie in terms of it being a solo movie and  setting something up, instead of showing a conflict between good and  good instead of good and evil.   9 out of 10! Near Perfect movie for the fans(9.5) and a good solid  action film for the general movie go-ers(9)",2016
5,"This review contains spoilers and my English is kinda bad.... so lets  start: After seeing 8.5/10 my expectations were really high but after  watching this movie i was so disappointed (probably the worst marvel  film since first CA what is really ironic since CA 2 was one of the top  three... )   Story: story is meh, nothing special, just CA and his buddy (with  support of 1/2 avengers) against the world   My PERSONAL problems with this film :  1. Terrible villain again, didn't remember his name 20min after the  movie ended, did pretty much nothing but showed some amazing prophet  skills   2.So many stupid things like how did villain know iron man will come at  the very end, how did he know nobody told iron man how his parents  died, also the big fight at the airport was just too dumb, pretty much  all mighty jean nm.2 and vision in the same fight where black widow and  hawk eye should just really be hoping, praying and dodging some random  explosions... this list could really go on and on   3.SO OVERCROWDED. Why the hell did ant-man join the fight? What  is his motivation? How does random Nigerian prince have powers to fight  CA and bucky ? HOW ??? Nobody but CA, Iron man and bucky had story  behind them (pretty pathetic though),others were just useless guys  fighting. At least they didn't ruin Hulk even more :-)  4.Really ? Tony tried to kill his friend CA and bucky and then after  being defeated he is f***ing cool with it? Best buddies again?   5.In iron man 3 tony was able to call 30 auto iron mans to fight for  him, here he got challenged by a freaking falcon with his wings? Also  at the airport he was unable to defeat CA and at the very end he almost  rekt two of them ? ... Guess I'm back to stupid stuff...  On the other side, good things:  1.Spider-man - yea this kid with no story in movie at all was one of  few good funny things about this movie   2.Cool fights right ?  All in all , 4/10 (coz i love superheroes movies), 1/10 is to balance  things...",2016
1,"Superheroes may misunderstand and they make mistakes but, ultimately, they are morally incorruptible. If they find themselves on the wrong side of a fight it's because they've misunderstood the nature of the problem. However, when reality finally hits home we can rely on them to admit their error and go off to fight together in the name of Truth, Justice and the American Way. People who die are unavoidable collateral damage, superheroes are beyond reproach and we need them too much to limit their powers. The world is just too scary and too dangerous to shackle the mighty with red tape and bureaucracy. Superheroes are better than us mere mortals, not just more powerful but also more moral. They don't need to follow the same rules we do.",2016
10,"Captain America Civil War is the thirteenth film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, with a screenplay by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely. In Captain America: Civil War, disagreement over international oversight of the Avengers fractures them into opposing factions - one led by Steve Rogers and the other by Tony Stark. Civil War is definitely one of the best Marvel movies to date, and absolutely on par with The Winter Soldier which was also great. They are both on top in the Marvel Cinematic Movies ranking of mine so far. The conflict between these well beloved characters is done in a brilliant and fantastic way by the amazing Russo brothers who took the cheese out of the first Captain America movie , made one serious and great second movie, and build upon them both with the third outing. Everyone does a great job here, Chris Evans has made Captain America his own same as Robert Downey Jr for Iron Man. It features a very big ensemble cast and not one of them is anything less than great on the role. The fight scenes are also some of the best ever made in a comic book movie, even better than in The Winter Soldier. Especially the airport scene is just mesmerizing and totally stands out from everything else that's going on. Spider-Man is also unbelievably well done and Tom Holland is just fantastic. I am one of the few people who actually loved The Amazing Spider Man movies, and really got mad to hear that they are going to reboot the character again but I can see now that it was worth it. The visuals are great from beginning to end, the music is also good as usual. The villain is something that most people though it was the weakest point but I strongly disagree with that. He had reasoning as to why he is doing those things, and he pushes the other characters in new directions which is also necessary. I generally adored this movie, and even though I am a DC fan, there's just no denying that Marvel knows what they're doing and that is why they are much more successful right now.",2016
2,Captain America is only a stupid cowboy in this movie. Why does he not sign the regulation papers? He isn't a god like Thor or Superman. Who is Captain America to be above the Law? Superman or a American cowboy? Why did he not tell Iron Man what his best friend have done with H.Stark and his mother? Does he know how to talk with his friends like Tony? I think not. He only knows how to fight... like a perfect soldier...,2016
8,"Checkmate, haters. And sorry, it's just not your year. I have seen this movie, but I won't mention a single spoiler here. (If you guys want proof, you can PM me and I'll tell you how the movie ends and the after credits). The reason I'm really writing this review is that I KNOW THERE WILL BE BIASED PEOPLE HERE WHO'LL WRITE THAT BVS IS BETTER and this is trash, etc, etc. Well, just see this movie and judge for yourself. Speaking briefly of the movie, it is an emotional roller coaster with an absolutely beautiful end. Spidey had a satisfying screen time. As for the acting, by the time the movie ended, I was a happy man. Russov's are handling Infinity War, and after watching this movie, how they did justice to characters, I'll not worry. A movie we wanted as well as deserve.",2016
3,"The story goes, Marvel runs out of ideas. They got excellent stuff shown in the first movie, then something lesser in the second one, and then the third one was like - somebody damn insisted on making it, even though there was no story written...",2016
10,"I loved every second of Captain America: Civil War. Everything was so well put and the story and plot worked very smoothly. This movie is everything Batman V. Superman should've been. Every character fit right and at no point did the movie feel crammed with superheroes. In my opinion, the two heroes that stole the show was Spider-Man and black panther. They got both of these characters right especially black panther. As much as I loved Batman V. Superman, I have to give this movie more credit. The Russo brothers did not disappoint and they delivered another marvel masterpiece just like the winter soldier. This movie was very good and I plan on seeing it again when it comes out to all theaters and maybe a couple more times! This movie made me very excited to see what comes next in the MCU.",2016
1,"1st, Civil War is basically a copy of BvS. A government building gets blown up by a bomb, killing a prominent government official. A villain manipulating heroes into fighting.",2016
1,"Just saw it. Not gonna go in depth but incoherent plot with lack of motivations for a lot of the characters to even fight to begin with. Didn't like the actor who played Spider-Man, his jokes were bad and misplaced in the middle of action scenes. Spider-Man seemed like he was added in at the last possible moment of production as he seemed out of place. I mean Tony Stark shows up and just blindly follows Tony. Black Panther was alright but oh boy does his mind change fast but like Spider-Man, he was shoehorned in. Ant-Man dragged along to be beside Captain America, he just blindly follows Cap.",2016
9,"I was one of the few fortunate people who got to watch this early. This movie was everything i hoped Civil War to be. It was funny, got you emotionally involved and Action Packed. Yes! the action is done brilliantly. The best I've ever seen in a comic book movie. Maybe one of the best in movies in general. This movie is not your average comic book good vs evil movie. It's much of a clash between ideologies which was really interesting to see. I also have to talk about how Spiderman was portrayed in this movie. I really liked him. As expected he was not the focus of the movie. However, he was not just a cameo either. The few scenes he was in the movie was enough to like him. If i have to point out flaws there is hardly any. Marvel is almost perfect. Almost. I do have one problem with the movie. It was the main villain. Like other marvel villain, this villain just didn't work for me. The movie would have done fine even without the villain. It feels like he was just there because ...he was just there!. But it's not a deal breaker people!! The story isn't about the villain. It's about Civil War. And you're gonna get it.. I can't recommend this movie enough. Believe me guys, the 1 star reviews are all from Marvel haters. They just can't accept the fact that Civil War was a great move. Most of those reviewers probably haven't even watched the movie. Ignore the haters and watch the movie. You won't be disapppointed.",2016
9,"This movie is so great directed by the Russo Brothers they done a great success. A better movie than BvS, this is possible the best movie of MCU with respect of Winter Soldier. Spiderman OMG great performance by Tom Holland and Black Panther another great debut for a great character of the Marvel franchise. Infinity Wars is in great hands of the Russo Brothers.In other things this movie only fails in the villain Baron Zemo but the fight in the airport was possibly the best action sequence in the history of super hero movies. It's not a revolution of super hero movies but this is fresh air for the MCU and overall the genre, DC/Warner needs to learn of how make a great universe.",2016
1,"You might wonder at first why I rate this movie with 1. Read the whole review and then later you'll find out why. So, without further due let me tell you my opinion about this movie.",2016
3,So Disneys: Marvels: Avengers: Captain America: Civil War was basically a pile of garbage. The fight scene with Spidey and Ant Man and the introduction of Black Panther were the only real redeeming factors.,2016
1,"It is overstuffed(in order to be very good) and repetitive like other avenger movies and has a serious identity crisis. Apart from cinematography and action everything else is pathetic, It is more suited to children, people with fully evolved minds would find it absolutely boring and this is the trend now with all the superhero movies which have everything stuffed in them except a story(forget about being a decent one),The main problem with captain America is stuffing every superhero on earth, i think a superhero movie should be about one super human being who realizes that he has powers and uses them to do good for the mankind,but here u have a no. of superheroes (who sometimes fight among themselves) and only a poor solitary villain which makes the movie that much less interesting due to lack of power balance between the villain and hero.Any normal guy would have a perception from the start that ""there's no way this villain can save his ass from these many SUPERheroes"".",2016
9,"Shyamalan had his debut with the critically acclaimed 'The Sixth Sense' followed by positively reviewed movies 'Unbreakable' and 'Signs'. After that, he went through a series of duds with 'Lady In The Water' , 'The Village' , 'The Happening' , 'After Earth' and was termed one of the worst directors of all time with 'The Last Airbender'. But, he made a decent comeback with 2015's 'The Visit' which received generally positive reviews and he's back at his game with 'Split'.",2016
8,"This movie will keep you watching waiting for the next character coming out of James McAvoy. He should have won some awards for his performance of a man with many different personalities. James was very convincing in every part he played. The end is great but I don't want to give anything away so I won't comment on that at all. Well written and the actors were perfect. Watch it today, just don't make the mistake of downloading a different movie called Split about bowling. I did that and that is one of the worst movies I ever saw!",2017
8,"I was surprised to see that this movie was released last year (as I'm writing this) and I didn't heard about it, taking in consideration how promising the plot is.",2017
8,"Let me start off by saying that I haven't really like Shyamalan's work since ""Unbreakable"", but I have to admit that this movie made me believe in his vision again. I gave him another chance after hearing so many people raving about this movie, and I'm glad I did. This is an excellently acted, directed and thought out movie. It's intense, funny at some parts, and it is incredibly well thought out. Don't listen to haters just because they don't like Shyamalan's movies. Check it out for yourself and make your own decision.",2017
9,A welcome return to form for the director and James McEvoy gives one of his finest performances. I am not sure how many actors could achieve what he has executed so well here and one wonders if the film could have worked at the highest level without him. In between some of his bigger studio choices he has chosen challenging or interesting roles no matter how the films turn out and his range and talent always keep surprising but he takes it to another level here. ,2016
10,"firstly, i have to compare this movie to La La Land, because this is what is considered Oscar material and Oscar performances in 2017. If La La Land was an Oscar movie, this is effin' citizen kane. Loved the bruce willis cameo and that there is a cinematic universe somewhere between all those uneven films. This film delivers. It has an amazing performance and realistic characters in a surreal nearly sci-fi but engaging plot. There is no twist end. Not really. There is a bitter end this time. One that stays with you for a while after the movie ends. There is a desperation where there was once a ray of light in the ending. The film is occasionally funny and aware of it and is not easily categorized. It is a subtle commentary on many many things, violence, abuse, human nature, relationships, sexism, modern society, the potential of a human being, racism, the idiocy of the average people, our traumas, madness, the virtue of patience, existential angst etc It is true that it is a horror movie about a sick person, which may not be politically correct but is a very old and common trope in horror flicks. It is also true that this film turns the trope on its back, presenting us a charming psychopath. He does unspeakable things, but he is not evil, he is beyond morality and he has an ambivalent point of view. The movie doesn't take sides. Murder is not a taboo in this narration, it may be an act of God or some creature close to him. The characters that surround the protagonist are also flawed in many ways and not very likable (with a couple of exceptions). There are obvious (and delightful) references to Psycho and the Rocky Horror Picture Show. One thing is certain. This movie is not for people who always had it easy...",2017
7,"When this film made it's first debut I was hesitant on seeing it because I thought M. Night Shyamalan had lost his touch a bit but right when I thought everything was over for M. Night being one of my favorite directors/producers I just up and decided to give him one more chance with ""Split"" and I'm so glad I did. This was classic M. Night all the way from the twists and the unpredictable story-line to the scares and the edge of your seat thrills. This is just a great horror/thriller played out as a far fetched psychological thriller. It's well written and the plot is laid out perfectly to the end and If you like older M. Night films you will definitely enjoy this one.",2017
1,"Firstly, I loved the concept of this movie and was extremely excited to see it, therefore disappointed was an understatement. However the acting was superb and chilling, so this cannot be faulted.",2017
1,"I never have high hopes from M. Night, ever. This is the reason why. Where is the police investigations.. wouldn't one of the personalities turn on the other?? Oh, sure they send e-mails to the doctor..but why not to the local police department ratting one or the other out? I wish I could go negative on the review. Anyone who likes this has taste for complete garbage. Probably enjoyed Windows Me, Vista, 8 and 10 as well. Nice reviews on such utter piles of trash is the reason why we can't get a good movie. They had a birthday party at a mall..where security cameras exist, not only inside the mall but outside as well. Someone 'stalking' another human being would surely turn up on multiple security cameras at some point in time. Oh, right, we aren't suppose to think too much in this. I'm glad I wasn't the one paying for the movie.",2017
1,"me and my partner both went in really looking forward to seeing this film from the trailer, and we both like james mcavoy as an actor, but this was just terrible, i thought the plot got worse and worse and the acting wasn't great either imo, we don't get out much as we have kids but we both regretted going to see this, i pretty much laughed all the way through at how bad it was and throwing the unbreakable reference in the end, couldn't save this from being a bad film, also one of his personalities was a 9 yr old who acted more like a 4 year old, by all means make your own mind up but don't blame me if you read this warning first.",2017
1,"If tour-de-force performances alone made great movies, then ""Sixth Sense"" writer & director M. Night Shyamalan's ""Split"" would be one of the best. Instead, Shyamalan's twelfth movie qualifies as an unintentionally hilarious, multiple identity disorder, abduction chiller about a colorful fruit loop bristling with more identities than you can count on fingers and toes together. As the traumatized casualty of an abusive mom, woebegone protagonist Kevin Wendel Crumb (James McAvoy) has forged a 'Horde' of personalities to serve as a bulwark against grim reality. Predictable, derivative, and ultimately preposterous, ""Split"" contains McAvoy's nuanced performance as well as Shyamalan's usual standard-issue surprises. Indeed, McAvoy has a field day chewing the scenery as a wacko with 23 personalities who is gestating number twenty-four. Basically, this charming but deranged psycho abducts three pretty young things from a Philadelphia shopping mall and confines them for his own culinary delight in an underground facility from which escape is virtually impossible. Compared with other movies about split-personality psychos, ""Split"" does feature a looney tune with a greater number of identities than any other movie. McAvoy's chameleon-like capacity to shift from one identity to another in the flick of an eyelash is as fluid as if he were genuinely conflicted himself. Suffice to say, McAvoy is brilliant, but perhaps not Oscar brilliant. ""Split"" boils down to a clever, self-conscious one-man show despite the quartet of additional characters involved. Unfortunately, we see only eight of the twenty-three weirdos that McAvoy portrays, but none is either demonic or memorable. Meanwhile, two of those four other characters lack sympathy because they brought this tragedy on themselves by ridiculing the psycho. Shyamalan's surprises occur just where you would expect them, and you won't feel the overwhelming urge to shout ""WOW!"" because you are so flabbergasted. Meantime, Shyamalan struggles desperately to spawn suspense, but what he achieves remains at best trifling. Sometimes, this half-baked suspense proves aggravating because you realize how futile it is for these doomed characters. On the other hand, unlike most psychos on killing spree saga, ""Split"" doesn't wallow in gratuitous blood and gore. ",2017
1,Shyamalan again disappoints. Idk if I can even say I have spoilers the movie was so boring me and my girlfriend nodded off several times....this guy shouldn't be allowed to make movies anymore. This was like watching golf without the ball ...his therapist ignores signs of of his erratic behavior for nearly 90 percent of the movie ...the lead girl has flash backs of her creepy rapist uncle in a truly unnecessary and lame sub plot. Why not focus on the main plot or making the audience feel the women are in some real danger. It's teased relentlessly that Macao's character is evolving into the beast but when he becomes the beast literally nothing happens..... the plot is trash and I am done paying to see this guy's. Horrible movies ..just like the happening and so many other movies don't waste your money,2017
1,Watching this movie is 2 hours of my life I will never get back - A total waste of time and such a disappointment.,2017
8,"What a terrific comeback for Shyamalan! Many have been vocal that horror writer-director M. Night Shyamalan has been on a downward spiral after having peaked with Unbreakable, his very own superhero origins film. Split sees the continuation of Shyamalan's tryst with the supernatural but also a long awaited rhetoric that this filmmaker was merely waiting for the right moment to resurface. While his last film - The Visit - was predictable but entertaining, Split underscores his storytelling prowess with the high level of creativity that made him a household name in contemporary horror.",2017
1,"The trailer made this film look quite interesting. However, from the very start, it was hardly captivating at all. The ""acting"" of the young actresses was atrocious! The girls not fighting back (even when Kevin's personality was a child!) was plain stupid. The flashbacks were forced, oh, and the ending... Why, just why??? The supernatural twist with a bunch of so-called philosophical citations?! Bad, bad, bad, so bad, really, really bad!",2017
1,"I didn't think it was all that good, its one of those films that gets over hyped and in the end turns out quite mediocre and boring, yes its funny in parts but you won't be rushing to see it again! Personally, I thought the acting was incredible and I loved the character development. What I didn't like was the portrayal of multiple personality disorder. It went from a very interesting story to a mediocre silly ending where he turns into a monster and starts killing people and starts doing supernatural things. That ruined it for me personally. M Night shyamlans direction was horrible towards the end. So far his best film will only be the sixth sense.",2017
1,"Usually horror movies don't get this high rating unless it is really  original so I was very skeptical when I saw this movie has 7.5 ..and I  was right !!! .... this movie could have ended in 5 minutes. 3 girls  facing an average size unarmed guy with mental illness but they decided  to do nothing ... not even a punch or a kick but only crying. The room  they were locked in had many things which could have been used as a  weapon ... i.e the shower curtain rod, the sink, or even their shoes  which one of them used to dig a hole in the ceiling, but of course  not... also none of them thought of hiding behind the door and attack  him from behind when he opens it. Indian movies usually are long and I  guess Mr.Shyamalan could not forget his origins, so he tried his best  to extend his 5 mins story to almost 2 hours movie. Save your time and  money and go stare at an empty wall which will be more exciting than  watching this garbage.",2017
1,"the first 20 minutes was like watching Criminal Minds episode. not it is a bad thing, but if TV series can get you the same excitement, why bother go to cinema ? there is not enough story, not enough mystery, not enough twist, to be told in this movie. if you like to revisit old time feeling when you watched Scream or I Know What You Did Last summer, well, maybe you would enjoy this movie. i definitely don't. if you like split personalities genre, don't get your hope high. Split not even at the same level with Fight Club or even Identity.the things that disturbs me the most is how 'the writer' seems to enjoy half naked teens. one girl needs to take off her shirt, one girl needs to take off her skirt. and you would think they would go a little bit respect with female lead, but nope. save the best for last. she finally took her shirt off so they can save her character (rolling eyes). it is just so stupid and only shows how Hollywood movie and their writers exploit teen sexuality in a very smooth way and nobody seems to realize how sicks these writers are. i mean, it doesn't even contribute to the story line, or any character development (who ? dennis ? what a clever way to explain sexually mental disorder patient, huh). i mean, they could make the girls keep their clothes, and the movie will still be understood like it is. i don't mind with a little bit nudity when it contributes to the story (like in 3096 Days, as disturbing as it is, the girl nudity really give viewers better understanding of the kidnapper and the girl relationship). it's kinda suck for mc avoy, since this must be a very interesting character to be played. and as far as his acting goes, i don't have much complain. but got to be honest, his performance shone away by how bad the story is.",2017
1,"I'm going to leave a couple of blank lines just in case you didn't see the SPOILER warning...but apparently it doesn't work. First, I'm going to say I don't particularly like horror movies, so if you're a big horror fan, you MAY love this movie. I hate any movie where women act stupid, helpless, slow...you get the idea. Poverty makes a woman intolerant and if you are a strong woman, this movie is going to seem like someone is slowly scratching their nails across a chalkboard. By the end of the movie I was hoping the beast would kill the victim!",2017
3,"Not too sure why this title was so highly rated. The synopsis really captivated me and I believe the potential of the movie was vast however, Split did not perform up to my expectations. The movie lacks substance and builds towards a supernatural ending of gore and violence.",2017

10,"This is a unique show, different from other time travel scenarios, in the way it is written, acted, and how well it's produced. I'd actually call it THE new break-out series to watch for 2016. It's nice to know there are still true Creatives working in the industry who can produce a gripping, interesting program without the benefit of a huge budget or glossing every other scene over in tons of fancy CGI. ",2016
9,"I tuned in to Travelers with low expectations. Time travel has rarely made for compelling television. Often, it's just an excuse for moving to a new historical setting each week. (Even Doctor Who stopped doing pure time travel after the first few years and started emphasizing the ""relative dimension in space."") Travelers sounded particularly dreary: people from the future taking over humans in the present. Oh, great, a time travel story that lets us glimpse the wonders of... the present.",2017

8,"One of the strong points of this show is that it isn't overly ambitious, pretentious, or scientific. It's very much grounded in the present (the present being 2016) and our reality, which I'm personally grateful for. There aren't any mustache twirling villains, mad scientists or shady billionaires (as of yet) - the characters are youthful and relatable, played by a very promising ensemble of Canadian actors. The premise is refreshingly original, utilizing the idea of souls hosting human vessels rather than the physical act of time-traveling (there's no cheesy time machines here). Grant MacLaren (played by Eric McCormack) rounds out the group as a much-needed older authoritative figure. Having seen McCormack's previous acting work I have no doubt he'll serve as a backbone for this show. ""Travelers"" has great potential and I look forward to seeing what it has to offer.",2016
10,"Excellent breakthrough series , so good to know there are still people who can make a gripping and interesting show without drowning everything in cheap CGI Exquisite , sometimes , insidious and scary plot worthy of the best Hollywood and Pine Studious have to offer. Excellent , logical character development with restrained , thoughtful performance. Everything makes sense , but nothing is an immediate in your face stupid - obvious . No silly, gratuitous violence - it s just good . The plot lines , oh mate ! The plot lines are amazing ! Subtle , just enough to get your brain going and scary and intense ,you ll be sitting upright all the way to closing titles I can t wait to see the next episodes .",2016
10,"Perhaps the viewing of ""timeless"" for me made ""Travelers"" look a bit better than it actually is, hence 10/10 rating, non the less, its easily the best sci-fi show released after ""The Expanse"" or if we're going to get into time travel genre maybe the first half of ""Continuum"".",2016

Travelers is unique in that the show's time period is fixed in the present though the characters come from the future. There is only a hint of what the future will bring, but the characters definitely think that some tinkering is required.",2016
10,Excellent Show. ,2016
10,"I'm looking forward to the rest of Season 1. The advertising of Travelers was totally inadequate and I came upon it only by accident. It seems that Showcase doesn't designate the ""NEW"" episodes as such, so it was only by searching that I was able to confirm that indeed this was a new show and not something I'd missed first time out. This makes me think there's a lack of support somewhere earlier in the chain, before it gets to the viewing public. That would be a shame as it is far superior to any of the other similarly-themed TV shows currently being aired. The characters are interesting and varied, and I look forward to seeing how they resolve the various complexities, housed in their 21st century bodies.",2016
7,"I really enjoyed watching the first season of Travellers this year. I think it's been one of the best shows on TV this season. I just really hope this series is renewed and its able to keep up its momentum; everything else I am watching at the moment seems to be falling apart. It's also great to see another series from Brad Wright. I was actually hoping for another Stargate spin off or reboot, but beggars can't be choosers. I will now and forever be a huge Stargate fan. I absolutely loved Stargate SG1 and Stargate Atlantis, but I absolutely hated Stargate Universe. That show couldn't be been any worst! It's also great to see Eric McCormack in another TV series. I absolutely loved him in the American sitcom Will & Grace. I think I will always view Will & Grace as this best comedy in my lifetime. I have read a lot of negative feedback online about the Travellers, saying it's nothing more than a rewrite of 'Quantum Leap' and 'Twelve Monkeys,' which I think is very unfair ‚Äì when, news flash ‚Äì nothing on TV (or even the movies) anymore is original ¬Ö For example, I really enjoyed the movie Twelve Monkeys. However, it was nothing more than a rip-off of Marvel's X- men 'Time Fugitives' comics (or early cartoons), released in the early 1980s; where Bishop travels back in time to stop Apocalypse from releasing a deadly plague that destroys the Earth. That's the whole plot of Twelve Monkeys by the way, and who knows where Marvel got the idea from, and the idea behind 'Quantum Leap,' whereby the main characters assumes the body of different people in history. This idea hasn't been explored again in quite some time. I praise the writers for bring this idea back into fashion. Fingers crossed this series is renewed for another season. I think it has huge potential for the future.",2017
10,"A lot has already been written about the plot, the acting and the tightness of the series. I was hooked from.ep.1 and have viewed the series several times. Oddly the small budget works in a weird way as in it lends it some authenticity though i do not the Lab def gets an update next series. The dialogues while not punchy linger...",2017
10,"This series is breathtaking, literally. As each episode ended, I became aware that I had not taken a good breath in the last 45 minutes. The acting is superb. Eric is wonderful in the lead role and Mackenzie is stunning. When you start this, give yourself enough time to power watch all 12 episodes because you will. If there isn't a second season, I will be very disappointed.",2016
9,"Clicked on this randomly because I was out of things to watch on Netflix and the description was interesting, pretty sure I would quit after the first episode.",2017
10,"I have written very few reviews on IMDb and only about films or TV shows, that grabbed my attention and/or surprised me in a good way. Well this show did both. I just binge-watched the show on Netflix (Thanks to the merciful Netflix gods, what finally brought to Bulgaria last year) and I cannot be more excited.When I started watching it, the only thing I knew was it was made by Brad Wright - the (creative) genius behind Stargate. As I revere everything Stargate and have loved all three television series and have been wallowing in a bottomless pit of despair, that we might not have any other Stargate show, I follow everything Mr Wright does. Well let me tell you, even for those of you who have never seen (may God have pithy on you) or dislike (for some unfathomable and probably diabolical reason) Stargate, this is a wonderful sci-fi show, which has nothing to do with space or aliens. What makes it superb - First, the premise and the story is great. It is hard to do good time-travel narrative, without falling into the pitfall of ever more complex paradoxes and time loops, which would made everything inexplicable. That does not happen here. Time travel is wonderfully complex, but not convoluted - the premise of jumping consciousness to people about to die is both simple enough for every viewer but also great vehicle for the plot, because it allows for the great clashes of future people with our normal day to day experiences, something that can last this show a long time if used properly and boy do they use it properly in this first season. The main story about the missions of the travelers is also great and its peaks and arks are never quite where you expect them to be. Overall great world building but Mr Wright was always good at it. The second thing that helps a lot here is the cast. The main characters are great, the group has fabulous chemistry and they play the mentioned culture shock and re-entry anxiety of people from another time like absolute champs. Each and every one of the main five (and even the sixth) deserves lengthy praises, but I won't spoil it for you. Please watch the show. The third thing follows directly from the former two - The atmosphere is awesome. We are talking here about a show, with very minimal special effects, set in current time, without any hops or flashes to the future world. Still the atmosphere is so sci-fi-ish it would make every fan of the genre very happy. Once you are into this show, there is no going back - music, stories, acting direction, everything builds up to an old-school grand sci-fi drama, which we all know and love. All this should be enough to compel anyone to watch this show. It is great, entertaining, totally binge-watchable and must-watch for every sci-fi fan, and I believe it's also a great entry show for viewers with little experience in the genre. You can simply stop reading here and start watching the show, because the last paragraph is for the geek squad (of which I am proud member, being the father of three kids and all) SO the final point for all the (hundreds of thousands) Stargate fans out there. This show can make you cry from Stargate-nostalgia. All the greats are here - Andy Mikita, Martin Wood and Amanda freaking Tapping are all directing an episode or two. Half of the cast from SG-1, Atlantis and Universe appears in minor, not-so-minor and recurring roles. If the second season opens up with an appearance from Richard Dean Anderson I will probably cry.",2017
9,"First off I have to shout out to Netflix for yet another solid outing. I am increasingly not even bothering w network scripted shows anymore and instead now find myself scouring streaming platforms (amazon has some good ones too) for new and hidden gems like this. The writing is crisp, the characters are compelling and well thought out and the plot, for the most part seems to makes sense so long as your willing to accept that this is sci-fi and thus you inherently have to suspend a reasonable amount of disbelief. Coudos also to the production values and acting talent achieved on what i am sure is a very modest budget. The show does seem like one you would see on the syfy network (and would easily be one of the best products on that channel), but manages a higher level of credibility imo. All of the characters are developed quite well w very interesting and pertinent sub plots that while they do thoroughly explore their individuality, don't go so far as to drown out the overarching plot if the series. The only reason i do not rate this a 10 is bc a perfect rating, for me, would require a perfect show. Which few, if any, can possibly hope to be. There's also a few minor details which irk me, but none to the degree that would ruin whats adds up to very strong series. I also didn't fully appreciate the ***spoiler alert*** very cliffhangery ending to the first season. I get why they did it wanting to keep the audience engaged and craving more, but it is a very tired and unnecessary trope by now. Furthermore it denies a show like this, which is nowhere near guaranteed another season, to bring any form of resolution to the engaging story they spent so much time building. Having to wait so long, or never if the show is not successful (great shows get cancelled all the time), is unnecessary and puts the viewer in an unenviable position either way. That said, overall definitely worth watching especially w the promise of more episodes on the way...",2016
9,"An original idea, with some great well developed characters. A good first impression to Netflix as well. Really enjoyed this series and had a great mystery behind it like who is he mysterious director, they where many twists and surprises from the very first scene. My only complaint would be if they were sent back in time to fix the world to make it a better place in the future, surely that would create a paradox and they would be cancelled out of existence, sure we'll find out in the second series.",2017
10,"Yes, there's a lot of ""time travel"" shows released those days ...but this one is different... The most interesting in that show is really the ""human side"" it's not another Scifi-high-tech-boring-to-death-thingy. Of course you'll have your dose (wink) of technology from the future but the characters problems are on another level. They have to live someone else's life and it's not that easy when all you know about those people you learned it from social media... I really loved the beginning of that show even though the rhythm was a bit slow because the writers took the time to set the scene without too many explanations. For once, it's made for a grown up audience. From the second episode there was more action and you're definitely hooked. The cast is very talented (no need to precise what pleasure it is to have Eric McCormack back on the screen.), the music adds a lot to the atmosphere too.",2016
10,"I normally don't take time to write reviews, but this is a flick deserves the shout out! The best advise I could give, is watch, after episode 2 you will be hooked! I say this cause, I was at a friends house when I seen the first episode of The Travelers, and even though I thought the characters were very interesting, but I didn't think it was going to be one of my new favorites, because I wasn't sure were this story was going, But that all changed, after the second episode aired, I realized, this show is going to be a hit! I stated feeling for 3 of the five main team members, and really loving this story line. My sister and I ended up on the couch for 10 1/2 hours binge watching episode 2-12 and then freaked out when we seen the season was over and it is unknown if Netflix is going to renew or not. I personally will be very upset if they don't get picked up for a season 2! what I like the most is the unique storyline.",2017
10,Seldom has a series hooked me as quickly or as deeply as Travelers has done. I want more of this. The quality of the production is astounding.,2017
9,"Better than average SyFy-style time-travel TV drama. Not an original concept, (Quantum Leap), but a more imaginative and complex update, front story and back. (Not much room for humor here.) More believable than Continuum or Timeless. Intelligently written and expertly rendered by talented, experienced, and in some cases, award winning cast and crew. (Eric McCormack fans will be pleased.) The real treat is the last two episodes. A fantastic cliffhanger finale that, hopefully, will guarantee a season 2. Travelers isn't breaking new ground. It isn't Orphan Black. It isn't Mr. Robot. But it is infinitely watchable high quality small screen entertainment. Gun violence is minimal. Sexual situations are neither exploitative nor gratuitous. Language is suitable for prime time.",2017

10,I created an IMDb account purely so I could review this show.,2016
10,"Based on the short story/creepypasta 'Candle Cove', Channel Zero S1 is a great horror series. Six 50 minute episodes that provide a creepy, unsettling and well-written horror story with well-developed characters is quite a new experience.",2017
10,"I have been a horror fan all my life, stretching back into my earliest childhood memories of being scared, and I think this show is made for other people who have the same ""bug."" ",2016
9,"I have found that there are many movies and TV shows out there that go for a lot of shock factor through disturbing imagery/ plot devices and over-the-top gore. Because of these standards becoming more consistent it has become more difficult for me to find actually ""scary"" or ""creepy"" movies and TV shows vs just plain disturbing or shocking ones. Channel Zero (Candle Cove) immediately brought a creepy element into the story from episode 1 and carried it through to the end in what I have found was an altogether creepy, thrilling and actually scary story. SYFY knocked this one out of the park I cannot wait for season 2. Take note, Ryan Murphy- this is what a REAL horror story looks like.",2017
10,"The series has quite a bit of potential and I'm a fan of the six episodes per season format, which already seems like quite a bit given the length of the source material. Really hoping for a Ted the Caver season coming up. Acting is decent and while Candle Cove was an alright short story, I don't think its best suited for an entire season of a horror show. But looking forward to seeing where it goes from here. Since the show is already renewed for a second season with the excellent No End Room story as its basis, hopefully it will continue to improve from here. Given that it is the third most popular Syfy channel show currently on the air given its premiere ratings, I'm surprised it has no other reviews on IMDb so far.",2016
7,"When I first heard that Syfy was making a show about creepypastas, I was skeptical at best, especially since I never found the story of Candle Cove to be scary; in fact, I viewed it as one of the weaker creepypastas out there. The few promos I saw intrigued me, though, so I gave the show a shot. I'm not sure whether that was the best or worse decision I have made about a TV series.",2016
9,*** This review may contain spoilers ***,2017
8,"If you are/were a Creepypasta reader then more likely than not you recognized this story before even watching one minute of the show. I know I did. And while I was excited to see a story I've read many many times,it's a weird one as most of you can see, the fact that it was on Syfy made me a bit nervous. But Syfy really came through with this one. The mystery and the creeps this show gives me is 10/10. In my opinion they did a great job so far adapting the short story to t.v. I haven't had the honor of watching the great Stranger Things but I have seen AHS. Don't go into this show with comparisons. Enjoy it as it's own creation. The actors do a wonderful job at portraying their characters personal losses and trauma creating the depth that makes me feel for all of them in one way or another. The show itself pulls you in,keeps you guessing, and even makes you a little uncomfortable at times in a way that a good twisted story should. Right now I give this an 8/10 only because it's the first season and I want to see how they adapt other creepy pastas before I upgraded to the 10 it deserves.",2016
10,"Wow, this is by far the most exciting thing since Stranger Things.",2016
9,It for some reason reminds me of Stranger Things following similar story line.,2016
8,"I really really enjoyed this series! Granted, I've only seen the first season, but I'm excited for the upcoming episodes! I can absolutely say, I personally liked it better than Stranger Things. I'm 40 so I've only heard about Creepypasta from my kids. I had known about Candle Cove, but I did not know there was a TV show about it until yesterday. I downloaded the SYFY app and binged them all. Some parts of the story started teetering on ridiculousness, but because of the story line, it made sense. Just when the ""oh here we go, it's about to get stupid"" scenes were on, they'd pull back just enough. I think the episode format worked well, as they were able to explain the story in more depth. I believe had it been a movie, it would have been just another stupid horror movie. I'm glad I found it and I do wish the show had been marketed or promoted more. I'm a die hard fan of American Horror Story, and while this no where near touched the shocking aspects of that show, it was definitely eerie enough to keep me intrigued. I liked the characters and the acting was believable. I've read in places that SYFY is known for canceling their shows. I really hope the second season draws a bigger crowd, maybe through word of mouth so this show will have a good run.",2017
9,"It played better than I'd expected from the previews, and it delivered as indicated - creepy horror.",2017
7,"Pros: original, genuinely creepy, strong supporting cast, good production values, a dramatic step up from normal SyFy fare. ",2017
7,I enjoyed this show and look forward to seeing how they build upon it. I like the format of 6 episodes although it seems a little stretched out for this story. ,2017
10,"I'm a horror genre fun and I've been obsessed with it since my childhood. What I like about Channel Zero is that it really goes the core of horror genre. These guys know what they are doing. It's so pure, there is no unnecessary jumpscares or wrongly used disturbing sound effects everywhere. The story line is well written. Everything is artistic, atmospheric, dark and surreal. Candle Cove was a good start and NoEnd House improves the series much more. I strongly advice you to watch Channel Zero. It has many potential. True horror lovers will adore it! This show needs much more attention!",2017
6,"One person below me compared Channel Zero to Stranger Things. I say, shame on you Sir. I as a SIFI hater and not a big fan of the 'supernatural' found Stranger Things excellent on all levels.",2016
2,"I do not know what the writers were trying to do with this, maybe MAYBE it was scarier on paper, cause it is definitely not on film. One potential scary point or creepy part, Tooth guy. This frigging tooth covered person thing that loves teeth and putting his dirty tooth hands in peoples mouths. Have some freaking manners (JEN!). Definitely potential for the pirate characters to come alive and be more animated and involved, rather than psychopath teacher and typical run of the mill thriller plot points. The whole season could have been avoided and made into maybe a 2 hour long twilight zone episode. In fact this show is kind of reminiscent of the 1983 Twilight zone movie Segment 3 with weirdo creepy Anthony kid using powers to get what he wants and create his own world, Except, Candle Cove is not scary or creepy like Twilight zone was. If you are very easily frightened or like weirdo extremely boring small town semi horror shows, This ones for you. Anyone otherwise looking for a good quick thrill with great suspense stay away, all this show leaves you thinking is what the F**k? I am so confused this all wrapped up into some nonsense lame story. Potential Burned.",2016
4,"The original ""Candle Cove"" story by Kris Straub was short, written in the style of a discussion taking place on an online forum, and had a great twist at the end.",2016
1,"Watching this show was a Complete Waste of time! I simply cannot believe how anyone can give it a rating of anything above 1. Cheap thrills, bad acting and a cheesy story line about sums everything up. Syfy has done Wonders With several TV shows in the past and I am normally a huge fan, thus having huge expectations when I initially sat Down to view the show. Unfortunately this show is simply below anything of their previous standards. I could in fact just barely force myself through an entire episode, People in what appears to be costumes purchased at some low cost Halloween store appearing in the bedroom at night is not scary but rather comical. Do yourself a favor and stay away!",2016
5,"Not 100% on board with the series so far, but at least Syfy can't disappoint yet again by canceling this! ",2016
5,"From the beginning it was like a movie based on the book by Stephen King, ""it"", which in turn was a pleasant surprise, because not every movie catches up with a terrible atmosphere. ¬†But over time, the film became very boring, and as a result, everything that there is, you could quite fit into eighty minutes of full-length movie, with everything I saw no need to extend this to the whole story of the season. and certainly expected more. ¬†Actors played tolerably well, I can not say that someone is unable to reveal themselves, most wine writer, as even the work of the director is quite happy ¬†The second season probably will not watch.",2016
1,"BAD Acting, FULL of clich√©s and NOT scary at all How people like this? Really, I just don't get it! Scary characters are not scary at all, and most of the story line is so boring and stupid. I love horror, but this? OMG, it reminds me how horror movies and TV shows can be so childish and bad. The bad acting is really embarrassing. American horror story (and especially the current season - S6) is amazing and it will not be fair to compare this to Channel Zero, but AHS is the complete opposite than this - amazing acting, terrifying and great stories (if we'll leave season 3 and 5 aside) The bottom line is that i really wanted to love this, especially because it's horror and i love this genre, But it's awful.",2016
1,"Where to start, Channel Zero is supposed to be about some internet myth known as a ""creepy pasta"" But as someone who doesn't know what that is and is just a genuine fan of thriller/horror films, I am going to describe this show as objectively as possible.",2017
1,"Okay, i'm gonna make this short, first because my English could be better and second cause I don't wanna waste any more of my time on this. I have watched the first season, and I was shocked. I am a big horror fan, but this was just awful. Just from bad actors to a poorly written manuscript. What is up with the tooth monster and a mother who sacrifices her own son? ",2017
9,"Give it a chance....Yes if you watch only a couple of episodes you might say, ""eh, can take it or leave it"". However I like to put in at least a few episodes to see if a new show develops. Many now popular shows started out slow. Even the huge hit, Seinfeld was iffy the whole first season. In fact they didn't have their breakout season until season 4. It's a shame that shows are chopped so quickly these days. Sometimes it takes a few episodes to even start developing characters. I recommend just watching at least to episode 8. By then, you will see the characters are finally developing and there are also a few surprises. Now at episode 10, it's practically a different show. Hopefully you will give it a chance too and then by episode 10 you will know for sure if you like it. For me, it's a show I look forward to and I am hoping this will develop into something even better!",2016
8,Even though I didn't really like the first episode(s) I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt. Of course it's not a top rated series but for SYFY standards it actually gets pretty interesting as soon as the character roles start evolving. I wrote this since the last couple of episodes really got my attention. ,2016
7,"The trick to watching certain genres in film is not to expect too much. You watch Van Damm or Schwarzenegger, you don't expect much. The Mechanic was entertaining, but it wasn't George III, right? It isn't reasonable to expect a TV show to be more than what it is. That's the case with Van Helsing. It is what it is: a SYFY channel original program with probably not the biggest budget in the world. Almost every TV show is rocky in the first season. It takes awhile for everything to shake down. Van Helsing is shaking okay. I watch it weekly, love the characters, and it's always a treat watching Christopher Heyerdahl. So hang in, be patient, give the show a chance. I think Season 2 will be much better. And besides, I'm interested to see the evolution of everything in this particular post-apocalyptic world, including when and how Vanessa becomes aware of who - and what - she is.",2016
8,"This show is quite enjoyable, especially because it doesn't take itself too seriously, like it quite often does happen to the big budget ones. I personally like the acting and the characters and wouldn't really change much about it. If more people would watch it, more people would like it. just like with any other show, while only the picky dicks are around you get bad reviews but when people start watching just for the fun of it. The characters are actually very interesting and well thought through. Its innovative especially in that respect and this makes it very enjoyable. Im looking forward to every episode, having a great time watching it",2016

The funny thing is that Vanessa Helsing (the star!!) is the one with healing powers not the so- called vampires (just LOL) - This Vanessa is a distant relative of Van Helsing, the story has nothing to do with the original story. I think they chose this title just to draw viewers (to their doom!!) - Very irritating, very boring, very clich√©, bad bad writing, poor set and costume, poor sound effects. - I would also say bad acting, but I hate to offend the actors, it's the director's fault, their only mistake is that they agreed to appear on this show.",2016

Unlike some of the people commenting here, I actually like how vampires are generally portrayed in the series, but the story is all over the place (as is the acting) making everything mediocre, incoherent, plain and all in all boring.",2016

The only reference or link to VH is the title, and the plot/description on IMDb. Did the actors know it was called Van Helsing, when making this, or was the title added on later by the marketing dept.Now up to ep6, mainly due to insomnia, and rapidly loosing the will to live. Never watched Buffy, as I'd already reached puberty when it came out, but after this rubbish, I'm willing to give it a go!!!!

As you can guess from the name, these are not even real, supernatural undead - just people who dress like hobos, have crazy hair, black marks around the eyes, and run around screaming a lot. Oh and they can easily be killed by gunfire, and do not have weapons. HOW did these things defeat humanity exactly? Other than the tired and overdone premise, which lacks the supernatural element people would expect from the title, we have bad acting, unmemorable boring soldier characters, and a setting that looks like it was filmed in an abandoned tunnel and a warehouse, with blood effects so bad that I have seen better in Asylum movies.

Sometimes no matter how much money one spends the result may still be crap. Poorly directed, poorly written, it is a total mess. Don't waste your time. It will, I predict, not last more than a season. Boring beyond belief. I suggest you turn your attention to British cop shows. At least they know how to develop a character.

1,"I have just started watching this series, as it's only hitting the airwaves in New Zealand tonight. I am already regretting it, as the feel of this show is almost farcical. The acting is mediocre, the special effects are certainly 'special'. If RDA were dead, his coffin would explode from the friction caused by rapidly 'turning' in it. If there were a 0 option, or even negative, I'd be all over those ratings. One person who was shot by a high-power rifle round from a sniper acted like he'd been potato-gunned. I can't rate this crap low enough. The only redeeming attribute is Tristin Mays. Beautiful. I simply want to shoot the lead actor, he comes across as every single thing the original Mac was not. AVOID.",2017
1,"One is better off watching MeTV and catching reruns of the original show. This show is an embarrassment. This show feels more like a CSI/ cop drama. There are time during this show I'm thinking to myself, ""where did MacGyver go. "" since when did Mac play second fiddle to his partner? This show is nothing more than a bunch of kids running around unable to act.",2017
1,Really? REALLY? Who writes this crap? Spoiler alert!!!!,2016
1,"First it started out like a Mission Impossible episode. Then it got worse. Totally miscast. Who wrote this crap??? Has literally nothing to do with the original. Including the show's theme music. Maybe next time, keep with the original concept. And since when does he have a team??? They should have had Henry Winkler do the show. Just then, it might be worth watching. As it stands now, no way am I going to watch another episode. If you are expecting a show like the original, this isn't it. Very disappointed. I was hoping for another good show and it didn't happen. Why does Hollywood insist on doing their own thing still? It isn't working. This show is not going to make it.",2016
1,"You've got to be kidding! It was a bold move to take a successful past series and bring it into the 21st century. I enjoy watching George Eads, but the series started with poor directing and acting, but got better. I believe a better technical adviser would have been helpful as well. When they introduced Sandrine's replacement in the last airing of the show, I couldn't believe it. They could've gone in so many directions, but this? It's just a ridiculous notion. MacGyver was enjoyable to watch up until that point, but now intolerable. I would be surprised if Henry Winkler signed off on that decision. It's unfortunate, but I believe this casting will spell the demise of he show.",2017
1,"One could of course debate that this is a modern version of the series meant for the younger viewers and that one should not put too much emphasis on the original show... Well i would then say this, why would you take all the core elements of a great show, toss them out, warp the rest beyond recognition and call it the same as the original? If the show had been made with i.e. the son of Angus MacGyver, Jack Dalton etc, etc i could have been a little more understanding and forgiving to it's ""new style"" but this show is supposed to be MACGYVER!",2017
1,Im sorry for bad English!!,2016
7,OK. I gave it a shot but this is truly terrible. Within the first 10 minutes he kills 4 people (2 more near the end of episode 1). I like the two main actors but the script they were reading sounded like it came from the George Lucas reject pile. ,2016

3,most of the characters are bloody terrible;,2017
1,"Let's face it. The original was a cheesy 80s TV show. It wasn't really that good, but it had an interesting angle about how it works. More or less a one man A-Team without the guns, but with the construction scenes.",2016

10,"To try and list all the things that make this show special, will take several weeks, so I'll try to cut it short. 
It is insanely well written, to the extent that something in s1 e1 that seems random is actually a thought-out part of the story that may become crucial in s2. Despite being a show about a possibly psychic detective, that starts with an insane amount of different stories about characters that doesn't seem to have any impact on each other, everything is actually connected and brought together in a brilliant unexpected way in the end. 
Apart from all this, Max Landis has managed to write every single character interesting, and capable of being the star of their own show. Above all they are relatable, despite or maybe because of them being a bit crazy and a loser in their own way. None of these characters are unflawed and it makes you care about them in a way that I've never been able to care about fictional characters before. 
Every single actor is hugely talented, and the creative team behind the show must have put such a huge amount of love and effort into bringing Landis's vision to life. 
The portrayals of women, lgbt+ people, people of color and mentally ill people are so respectful in a unique way that I think is mostly due to the fact that Landis knows how to write them as any other human being. As a woman I experienced a great relief in watching a show where no woman is sexualized in any way, but still considered worthy of love and acceptance. 
The dialogue is never random, it changes dynamically between hilarious and thoughtful. No clich√©s ever show up, which is incredibly refreshing. 
I could go on and on about this show, the beautiful music and cinematography, the powerful messages that are often underlying and sometimes outspoken, the relationships between the characters and the absence of toxic masculinity in the male heroes, but I'm already ranting, so I'm just going to end with this:",2017
10,"I can't recall the last time I was this fulfilled by a television show. I watched the first season this past February, and I was amazed that I hadn't heard of it until then. I quickly fell in love with it due to its refreshing originality, compelling storytelling, and fascinating bunch of characters. This is no ordinary show; it's intentionally wacky and confusing, it subverts tropes and cliches all over the place, and nothing is as it seems at first. Underneath it all, however, everything is connected in the most satisfying and entertaining ways imaginable. The second season just finished airing this past Saturday, and it was somehow even better than the first.",2017
9,"I will keep this short. You should watch this because is is sharp, funny, well written, well acted and engaging on many levels. Yes - I know it's nothing like the books. BBC UK tried that and it failed. Nobody has ever come close to doing Douglas Adams justice on screen because the insane intricacy and sheer scale of his stories make it impossible. BBC America has been very clever. They have taken the core concept and characters and done something utterly different with it. It is its own thing and stands on its own merits, which are many. If you are a person who gets terribly upset when a script is not faithful to the source material down to the last semi-colon, this show will make your brain implode. If, like me, you can let go of those expectations and enjoy what it is, rather than what you would like it to be, you might just enjoy it as much as I do. I love the books too and if I want the books, I read the books. This is a TV show and a pretty damn good one. If you can't separate the two, this is not for you. Try the UK version - but it ain't half as much fun.",2016
10,"I read the book many years ago, but went into this show with 0 expectations and open to where it would take me. And I kinda love it! It's a madcap, comedy/adventure that I think captures Douglass Adams' narrative style (at least as it applies to the Hitchhiker's Guide - my fav book of all time). It's a little bit out there, sure, but that's how the source material is. After watching the first two episodes back to back, I'm in. 100%. I can't wait to see where they go with this show. Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency is a lot of fun and I'm excited to continue with it. ",2016
10,This is one of those series that is going to be divisive in several respects. ,2016

10,"I found this show by way of watching a random interview about comics on YouTube, wherein the show-runner, Max Landis, hyperactive-ly explained the plot. I decided to give it a shot. Nine hours later I had finished the whole show in one run with breaks only to cook food that I ate in front of my laptop.",2017

9,I've read lots of negative comments but I'm thoroughly enjoying this after 3 episodes. Completely faithful adaptations of Douglas Adams seem kinda pointless as so much of his greatness was dependent on the ideas and the bizarre and impossible views he would conjure with words. The wit in his books was never heavily concentrated into the dialog and I think much would make visually dull jokes which required constant and tedious exposition (a permanently stuck sofa just looks too everyday and common to ever be funny).,2016
10,"This series is a really cool and unexpected from BBC, it doesn't have plot holes, the characters are all relatable in some point, in season two they had a bad guy who wasn't ""lead"" to it by others, only by herself (which is different from most of series). The secrers of their superpowers are still not over, and from the psychological way, this show helped me to accept the future as a thing and not keep living an unhealthy life consisted on guilt and past.",2018

7,"Dirk Gently's holistic detective agency is an intriguing comedic detective story set in a magical real world with larger and smaller than life characters tied by a chain of fate that looks like an incredible number of crazy coincidences. It is a very enjoyable series with good storytelling, good actors and a nice budget to go along. It is something different and defined that requires a bit of work on your part as it's not another dumbed down cop show, alas you will be repaid in full. Photography and music are great and effects are decent. Direction is good as well and actions are presented in an interesting editing with good framing.",2016
10,"So, this show is... a absurd thriller about a holistic detective name Dirk Gently followed by the CIA, a group of vampire punk and a holistic assassin.
He's gonna meet Todd, a loser who's gonna become is assitant without wanted to be and they have to find a missing girl who is also search by a weird cult who have a cat and a shark... this is as confusing that it sounds but in the end, everything is connected.
This show is good, absurd and weird yes, but good. This is a sand box and as no limit in weirdness, but also have very human characters and that just the right balance.
This show will maybe have a 3 season on Netflix and all be damned if this is not the case because this show means everything to me, and everything is connected !",2017
9,"It has been a long time since I read Douglas Adams' DGHDA so I cannot say if the character is faithful to the books, but my memory says not... That being said, it is a fine good romp, full of time travel mind twisters, silly puns, and off-beat plot lines that will keep you wondering -""What the heck is going on???"" Thankfully, the ""Previously on Dirk Gently..."" at the beginning of each episode will clarify last week's episode for you. ",2016

From the first view it seems to be a bunch of not connected staff, and you trying to understand what the hell is happening in the screen, but after comes UNDERSTANDING and joy. And you want to see it again. And again. 
To whom who did not like it after 1-2 episodes, please, give more trust. It's BEST SERIES EVER. For me it's a TOP show, the best of the best.",2018
10,"Not that the 6 part series made by the BBC of ""Hitch Hikers"" some years ago wasn't good, it was fun, the movie ... less so, movies/shows based on novels rarely satisfy those who have read the works, personally I've enjoyed some things and less others, What the people behind this adaptation have done is something else, something brilliant, the casting is good, the direction is good, the acting is good the screenplay is good, the whole thing is awesomnes, I enjoyed the first series, I found the second series so good I watched it twice, I feel, it's a new cult classic, those behind this found a way to bring adams' work to the screen in a good way, just maybe, this might inspire someone to do the same with ""Hitch Hikers"" something we fans of his can say ""Yes Finally""",2018
9,"Any reviews disparaging this brilliant production simply fail to truly comprehend the wit and social satire INTENDED (as in not stifled and stymied, and bound into perpetuity by the chronological time and literal social/cultural context of the time he wrote)! Adams always intellectually challenged his readers to conceptualize, not theorize simply from, or be fettered by the underpinnings of our own hum-drum everyday existence! He wanted to shake us up, get it?! And so though not literally pasted to or from the Adams books, this series certainly captures the rebellious, inquisitive, always questioning and exploring of infinity and themes that Adams intended for us! It is truly mind over matter, and literalists simply do not grasp that fact! Let this series take you on a ride, a ride which though not literally transcribed from the Adams Dirk Gently books, intellectually transports you into the world that Douglas Adams intended! The universe is vast, Gently (as in all great novels, the Everyman) is onto something, so there is indeed interconnectivity, and it all is a foil for human egotism!",2016

10,"This show is unlike anything else on TV. It is fantastically bizarre with interesting characters and story lines. The actors are perfectly cast. Their lines are witty and whimsical. You will find yourself continually backing up the DVR to hear a line you missed while laughing or to just hear a line again. Dirk is a contemporary Mad Hatter caught up in a world filled with Lost like conspiracies and mysteries intersecting with characters from Wonderland. As Dirk says, ""I always end up exactly where I need to be, despite the fact that it is rarely where I intended to go."", and so will you as you follow along on their wild ride.",2016
9,"As a huge fan of Douglas Adams, I know how difficult it is to do his books justice on the screen (HATED Hitchhikers Guide). I almost reread the books before watching the show but then decided against it. I was a huge, huge fan of the books.",2017
9,"I did not expect much from this show, considering fact that it is BBC America production, not BBC UK, and because of tons of negative reviews on web. When I start some show I usually watch one or sometimes two episodes a day. This one I watched in one breath. I didn't even pause it for bathroom or making coffee. Eight episodes of 40 minutes each felt like one bit longer movie. Ignore fans of Douglas Adams who bash this show for not being faithful to original novels. It is not faithful, that's a fact, but it does not make it bad show. On the contrary. Adams is tricky for screen adaptation. BBC UK tried and failed. This is just based on Adams, but it is great show in every aspect. Any attempt of concise retelling is pointless, cause this show is one big puzzle, labyrinth that perplexes more and more and twists happen every few minutes. If you liked Misfits or new Doctor Who, if you like Douglas Adams, but you're not obsessed fanatic, this is perfect show for you. But if you expect verbatim adaptation of the books or if you like linear stories, better skip it.",2017

9,"I have to admit the writing wasn't quite as good as the writer's last work on The Missing - maybe they felt they had to push things even further, but I still really enjoyed this. High tension and atmospheric, brilliant acting. Even when the high stakes gave the cast a lot to do. It also looked incredible, making the most of the stunning highlands in a way that added to the tension and mystery. The imagery was really powerful. The message about actions having consequences stuck with me too, a brilliant ending, and I think it's rare for something to not only put you on the edge of your seat but too also make you feel emotional. Top TV.",2016
8,"In recent years we've seen a few 'whydunit' dramas emerge, such as The Fall, when we know who the perpetrator is from the outset and spend the series trying to figure out what drives them to kill. One of Us, which began last week on BBC One, however reverts to the traditional 'whodunit' style - with not just one homicide, but three. ",2016
9,BBC have always been leaps and bounds ahead of ITV (Channel 4 can put up a fight when they give a s**t) but ONE OF US seems to exist to stick it's fingers up around it's mouth and blow a taunting raspberry to Chris Chibnall and BROADCHURCH.,2016
3,"It is tempting to suggest that there is a lot of overacting as one character after another steps of to bat and takes his or her best swing at devouring the entire set by chewing up mammoth mouthfuls of scenery. However, it's really an issue created by the writers who seem to have never grown out of that kind of dark teenage angst normally reserved for stories about the dating lives of vampires and werewolves. Almost every single person, whether it be a main character or a minor one, has some deep dark secret struggle. And this allows each one to give some sort of speech filled with clich√©s and platitudes about how hard life is and expound on whatever existential crisis he or she is faced with. Not one person is ""normal"" or even remotely likable, but, of course, the solution to the crime is supposed to be so shocking that the writing team probably thought that the audience would at least think the worst of the worst was the guilty party. Unfortunately, the plot device used was so ridiculous that if I had perhaps begun to believe this hot mess would resolve itself in a redeeming manner, I was sorely disappointed. Moreover, they sure dragged things out tying up all the frayed ends that they had created complete with more pontificating about the trials and tribulations of existence. So, if you want melodrama boarding on high camp - lines so predictable you find yourself mouthing them along with the actors - and a story that is as tangled and twisted as it is overworked and overwrought - by all means check this miniseries out.",2016
10,"The show expertly opens by making you fall in love with two newly weds who meet an untimely demise, putting you on the back foot as the audience. It can only go up from here right? Wrong. As the characters are confronted with the killer of their beloved children, one of them is capable of murder, but all of them are capable of protecting the ones they love.",2016

5,"I loved The Missing, so was excited to see there was a new show from the same writers. So far I've watched the first two out of four programmes, but this hasn't gripped me in the way The Missing did and I'm trying to figure out why. It has some good actors and good individual performances and the Scottish backdrop looks brooding and provides a good backdrop, but there seem to be way too many characters and too much packed in for a series totalling four episodes. For me it needs tightening up, and I want to care about somebody. In The Missing there was a big cast but I did care about the little boy and his family, and the police officer., and even the main suspect! I was intrigued initially by the concept, but haven't really been given sufficient information to care about the dead young couple or their families. I think if it had equalled The Missing's eight episodes then perhaps there would have been a gradual unfolding and more nuanced storytelling, allowing us to bond more with the characters. Contrast this with The Night Of which sucked me in right from the start..",2016

The boy-husband slumped over on the sofa soaked in blood. The devastated parents and siblings (next door neighbors) of the two victims. The crack-addicted schizophrenic murderer? crashing a stolen Lexus while on his way (for some mysterious reason) to the home of one of the victims. The pretty female agent investigating the murder happens to be selling illegal acid to make bank for her dying daughter's brain tumor operation in India. Her daughter's girlfriend took a hit of that very acid thus hurling herself from her balcony because she thought she could fly. Daddy #1 (abandoned the family years before) suddenly grows a conscience so profound that he walks in front of a truck. More crying. Daddy #2 is hiding the fact that he has Parkinson's Disease from Mom who is screwing their farm supervisor. The most sympathetic characters are the hacker son and a dying older woman hellbent on assisted suicide. The list goes on. If Nessie herself had risen up out of the Loch like Godzilla and devoured the whole lot of them I wouldn't have been surprised. The writer should have used 'Chekov's Gun' to cut out all that was not serving the story (and the characterization) around the murder mystery so that we could have watched a crackerjack narrative showcasing this talented ensemble cast.",2018

Although you don't know how many people have voted there, it surely is a good start.
Then, there I went, having read the mini description Netflix offers, and seeing all too soon that it was like that, in the first 5 minutes everything happens and although it doesn't seem logical, or well acted, it's there.
Then, from this premise the mini series continues, trying to surf the waters of being a drama crime series, not arriving until the very end of the fourth chapter, to explain and develop the various anomalies that you can see.
It is not well acted at all, and If you look carefully at the end, it seems like an 80's soap opera acted by amateurs.
Did not have anything else worst to see, if not surely I would. Luckily we can skip forward some passages.",2018

I am waiting for the revelation that someone was screwing one of the farm animals. That's about all that was left. Shakespeare could not even have pulled this one off. I'm not sure if I can make it through to the end. No one edited this script, and they damn well should have.",2018
9,"Despite the rush of people on IMDb who seem strangely desperate to trash this new show; I personally, as a fan of procedural crime dramas and team ""puzzle of the week"" shows like House M.D, really quite enjoy Bull so far. The first episode had an intriguing premise, the second episode built up the team members' characters enough to at least make them likable, and I think Michael Weatherly is enjoying the role massively and it shows in his winning performance. The psychological aspect of the show is something I don't think we see enough of on television in general and even if some of it is pumped up into quick, flashy computer bites, it still aids the story which is really all it's meant to do. As shows in their infancy go, I think this one is off to a promising start. Bull is a well-shot bit of interesting fun and I will definitely keep watching!",2016
5,"Although the premise of Bull may have some merit, which is the story of a very good looking Dr. Jason Bull (starring Michael Weatherly) who owns a company named Trial Analysis Corporation, and whose life ambition is to be able to read people, including lawyers, judges, perpetrators but especially prospective jurors so that his clients will win their trials regardless if they are innocent or guilty, there is just a bit too much hocus pocus involved to pique my interest.",2016
7,"Its more like Person of interest meets Boston Legal. They have started off a great idea. I hope that it will get better as they go. As for now, the story line is acceptable but everyone except Michael Weatherly seems to be a bit lost. If they could change at least a couple of the supporting actors to somebody who can pull the character off that would make a huge difference. For now, i will keep watching the series. This is also the first time i am writing a review on IMDb. I couldn't stand the show being rated really low and a huge effort has been made and it is interesting and not like what people make it out to be. I urge that people take a view before going through the reviews and not watching it. Maybe you will like it, maybe you wont but you wont know unless you actually watch it.",2016
10,"This is an awesome show and NOT a Lie to Me knockoff. Before there was Lie to Me, there was Dr. Phil McGraw. ",2016
1,"I was intrigued by this show with the ads that appeared during the summer. I've liked Michael Weatherly, but will admit to not being a fan of Dr. Phil, who is both the inspiration for the title character and was a co-writer of the pilot. Dr. Phil: don't quit your day job. The show is simply unbelievable. A multi-million dollar high-tech office, with dozens of staffers, yet no apparent source of income for any of that. The pilot dialogue, to acknowledge Dave Barry's phrase, seemed to come from the wooden dialogue generator. All of the characters are relentlessly hip: there's the now obligatory knit cap wearing techie; a fabulously dressed wardrobe consultant; Bull relieves tension by hitting a tethered baseball in the office, while replete with his oh-so-cool two or three days' of beard growth. None of the characters are people you feel empathy with or care about. Early on, this show has benefited immensely from the prime time slot following ""NCIS."" I will be very surprised if it holds the early ratings as the season goes on. Maybe not the best career move for Michael Weatherly.",2016
7,"I loved the trailer and decided to catch it as soon as it came out. I ended the first episode disappointed as there was little character development or excitement. From the second episode onward, there was a much harder emphasis on character development and it has worked wonders for the show. As the season progressed, I found myself rather absorbed by the characters and the chemistry between them. Particularly, Dr Bull and his team. It was brilliant to watch. Even though the plot is more in the unbelievable territory most of the time, the characters and their relationships and the great one liners make it a worthy watch. Afterall, those were the things that made the three CSIs and the many NCISs work. Michael Weatherly is practically the same as he was in NCIS and I think for this character, that's exactly what was needed. I loved the first season to a certain extent and am looking forward to the second season. If the quality of the writing does not considerably improve, I believe we won't be getting a season three. Which would be sad.",2017
10,"An original series that (at this point and time) is highly underrated. Weatherly proves his excellent acting ability (once again) and makes this show tick. The casting is very good. The show is different than any other, finally a breath of fresh air. Intelligent, well thought out and excellent writing. The show is a drama, not a comedy-drama, which might disappoint some viewers who tune into to see the playful Tony DiNozzo character Weatherly played for so many years on NCIS. A far cry from NCIS, as excellent as that show is, you will not see DiNozzo in this show. Weatherly plays a mega-intelligent psychiatrist who puts together juries to win. Gathering information on each juror from many sources, including social media, to make sure the jury ""fits"" his client to win their case. Weatherly has the ability to pull off the character with ease. An excellent show, I highly recommend.",2016

3,"Dr. Phil's megalomaniacal fantasy about a psychiatrist who can completely control the outcome of a trial by jury selection. The entire premise is false. Jury consultants have limited value because jury selection, in the vast majority of cases, involves a limited amount of time, is based on limited information and each side has the same number of challenges i.e. you don't ""select"" a jury, you ""deselect"" one. Neither side can ""stack the jury.""",2016

I don't need more gore, horror, terror and lots of crime to make for a solid program. I'm enjoying what is clearly a successful jump for Weatherly in character choice, a very tough thing to do after a long star turn in a very successful Bellesario franchise like NCIS. The invitation to do more of the same was, I am sure, the reason Weatherly waited as long as he did to make the jump. I'm taping to zip through the ads to keep the story line clicking along and I only do that for a handful of must-see shows. This one's going to get re-upped for a second season at the least.",2016
4,"Michael Weatherly left NCIS for this? It is sad to see him now associated with this really poor quality show - both in the plot itself, and in the writing. Yes, I might understand that Weatherly wanted out of the type-casting that NCIS gave him, but for this?",2016
4,"I like to watch TV shows regardless of their first pilot episodes but this one I will not even consider in doing so, it's another attempt to copy ""House M.D"", ""Mentalist"" or ""Lie to me"" where the main character is a brilliant man who can read people and profit in some way from it. The introduction was dull and started out as a boring show with information that was not entirely right, knowing a person by the choices made in the past does not give you a perspective of what that person will do in the future, more so when that choice is argumentative. The show has potential but from the first look, it just lacks ingenuity.",2016
2,"Sept 27, 2016 Update. Oh great as if the first episode of Bull wasn't bad enough the director of episode 2 decided to inject camera shake. Camera shake is otherwise known as ""Change the Channel"" in my house.",2016
8,"Entertaining. Engrossing. Well-written. The plot portrays seemingly credible situations. I give this show an 8.0 on a 10-scale. And I'll probably rate it higher in a few weeks if they can keep up the quality. And the lead actor --- Michael Weatherly who plays Dr. Bull --- is really excellent. Mr. Weatherly makes Dr. Bull out to be a little cocky but still a very likable person. And let me make it clear that I ain't no fan of the real Dr. Phil who is the actual model for the fictional Dr. Bull. (I find Dr. Phil's overbearing personality a little hard to take.) The sad truth, however, is that real jury consultants and ""hired-gun"" expert witnesses charge such high fees that they can only work for big corporations and wealthy clients. People who are not nice and have bad stuff to hide. Such as companies that pollute rivers. And nasty banks that cheat plain folks with toxic mortgage deals. Etc.",2016
2,"After 13 seasons of being DiNozzo, one can understand it's difficult to get off it, which means that Michael might not be other than Tony, with the winks, the posture, the smiles, in short, a 'replicant' of DiNozzo. ""Call me boss""? Oh Gibbs! Too stereotypical.",2016
7,"Don't listen to the Naysayers, and cynics on this review status. This TV show Bull is good, but like many others along this line, you have to remember it is just getting started. Just like any new product that has problems and kinks, they have to be fixed and then rolled out again. Also, trying to care and mend people is a very well difficult and tasking thing to do, but he does it with a bit of style, grace ¬Ö and oh, getting up in people's faces that deter him with a calm demeanor. Thus, with his experience, this is something he does to get a better scope or compass about them, trying to capture their character so he will know where to go next. I also like his crew, each one does a good job with all they need to do, and with a bit of spirited confidence and can-do attitude alongside of a small amount of humor and comedy. ",2016
1,"I like Michael Weatherly and I really wanted to like this show, but I found his character bombastic to the point that I just got annoyed. Here we're presented with someone who holds numerous degrees who is supposed to be the smartest person in the room, yet when the guy got shot on the steps of the courthouse he seems to be surprised by it.",2016
9,"I was sad to hear that Michael Weatherly was leaving NCIS. So much so, as to wonder if I'd watch again. (not really, it's too good). So when it was announced that he was granted his own series, I hoped that it wasn't like so many new series which are just a seeming contract fulfillment to said star. As an unabashed fan of Weatherly, this show was an excellent start to what we can only hope will be a showcase for his talents. The plot was solid,writing first rate, and cinematography first rate, it seemed to me to be movie quality. Stepping into a more serious role was absolutely no issue for Michael. As a matter of fact, I hope the writers will give him some latitude in his 'impressions and one liners'. This is not a 'you have to settle into the characters' to enjoy it kind of series, it's solid from the start. I'm looking forward to next Tuesday. Congrats Michael.",2016
10,The first episode just aired and it was a great one. Throw in Michael Weatherly with Dr Phill and you get a great series. The acting is great with some familiar faces here and there. It is also based on science and that is always nice to see in a series.,2016
2,"To start with, the concept is great! The problem is that not ONE of the supporting characters is remotely likable. NOT ONE! With House, everyone one of the supporting doctors, administrators and patients was likable to some level. The first episode, the ""client"" was half likable towards the end of the episode, but by then the show hit the ""WHO GIVES A CRAP"" territory. The dialog is weak and the acting even weaker.",2016
2,"I was so disappointed in the 1st episode. But I like Michael so much and really wanted to like it, so I watched the 2nd. But I was still so disappointed. I won't be watching a third episode.. I don't like his image at all in the series, His personality is so bland and emotionless. He's not positive, negative, funny, angry, caring, he just comes across as dull and boring. The cast is also boring, the plots are uninteresting. Wasn't there a better selection of series for him to choose from. I don't know what else to say except I hope you get a new show real soon. I'd rather not see this show drag out too long And hopefully he will start a new series real soon.",2016
8,"So being an avid fan of NCIS, I was very skeptical of this show, hard to imagine Tony becoming Dr. Bull. Love the actors chosen in the cast, and a few new faces as well. But was pleasantly surprised in first episode. Started off good and ended even better. Took a few turns, and kept you guessing what would happen, and who did it. Can't wait to tune into the future shows, hope it continues & gets some great reviews. Few jokes in between, which helped lighten the story a bit. Funny to watch jurors look at him & say what they are really thinking. Certainly makes you wonder what kind of cases will evolve in the future episodes. I anticipate watching him & the cast, and have it programmed in my DVR already for the entire season. Congratulations Michael & cast on a new future!!!",2016
1,Absolutely awful show and it also makes no sense whatsoever .,2016
4,When I first saw the previews I wasn't sure about the show it looked boring. However I figured I would give it a try and see. ,2016
