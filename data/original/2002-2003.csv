10,"I don't subscribe to HBO. A couple of weeks ago I heard an interview with a young actor from this series on NPR. It was described as a ""gritty crime drama"" with many Baltimore locals portraying variations on themselves. The interview made it sound interesting enough that I decided to check out the first season on DVD.",2006
10,"Along with TV-shows like 'Oz', 'Deadwood', 'The Sopranos' and 'Six Feet Under', David Simon's 'The Wire' was part of a revolution - qualitywise - in television. Although it is very entertaining, this isn't just entertainment; this is art, pure and simple - and the concept of this show was groundbreaking. On the surface, one might think this is a show about crime, but really, 'The Wire' is about the life and soul of a whole city. Every aspect of the city of Baltimore gets its share of screen time, and the way this is done - the writing, the direction, the amazing performances by the terrific cast; the music, the camera work, the realism... I could go on and on - is just outstanding. On par with 'Generation Kill' (no wonder, since the same creative team was behind both), this is as good as television gets.",2014
10,"This is the TV series that everyone should watch. On the surface it shows the never-ending cat-and-mouse chase between criminals and law enforcers, but below the surface it's a depiction of how corruption eats its way into each and every institution of power and a full and complete autopsy of a capitalist society.",2014
10,"I say that without a shred of hyperbole. The Wire's importance, beyond setting the standard for all modern television, is one of a historical document. 500 years from now, the show will surely be one of a handful that allows future generations to glean the state of American society during this time period -- it's problems, it's people, it's language, it's institutions, and the constant tension that exists when all of these are forced to coexist.",2016
10,Hate to be rude but don't pay attention to the moronic post below. That was some of the most lame criticism I have ever come across on this site. I doubt the guy even watched the entire first season. This show is the best thing going on TV. Writing. Direction. Acting. Its all perfection. The people behind the show are former journalists and police officers who were covering crime in Baltimore or working the beat as cops for over 20 years. They know what they speak of and don't rely on cookie cutter characterization. This is the closest thing to a novel that you will find on TV. It is so impeccably plotted and so honest and realistic that I will never be able to watch another cop show (or any TV drama) without comparing it to this example of television greatness. Did I mention its also the smartest TV show on the air too? The Sopranos gets the media attention but it can't match the sophistication and grittiness of The Wire. The Sopranos is a romanticized TV crime drama by comparison. And as for Six Feet Under? Please! It reached its peak in its final six episodes of the first season and haven't lived up to that magic since. It doesn't get any better than The Wire. Universal critical acclaim. The winner of the 2002 TV Critics awards. The winner of the 2004 Peabody award. Nuff said.,2004
10,"You want to get close to the streets? This is it, and what a true American tragedy it plays out to be. The drama is scintillating, without being sensational. These are real people, in real life, with real struggles, played beautifully by an incredibly talented Dominic West and crew.",2014
10,"HBO's ""The Wire"", another ground breaking TV crime series from David Simon who grandfathered ""Homicide: Life on the Street"", raises the bar for crime dramas by dedicating a whole season (13 episodes) to a single story with unparalleled realism. Telling of a motley bunch of detectives who set about to bring down a Baltimore drug ring which supplies a black innercity housing project, the gritty 12 hour first year series slowly develops a broad range of characters from street punks to senators in a world where the blacks and whites of good and evil are reduced to shades of gray and everyone is connected by their humanity for better or for worse. Not the usual cops vs bad guys fare with episodic ups and downs, ""The Wire"" is one long drama about people which happens in a law enforcement and crime setting. For realists only, this series will require some viewer patience while the complexities of the plot and the characters are developed. One of a kind...so far. (A)",2004
9,"""The Wire"" is widely considered as one the best series ever, and by many critics as the best. Despite its title, its topics are much more varied than wiring criminals and fighting drugs: criminality in general, law, ethnicity, crisis, politics, education, media, etc.",2017
10,"Rarely do you see a show like this that has so much ambition in what it's trying to accomplish, and more rarely do you see a show like this succeed in it's intention of doing so. Let me introduce you The Wire, the best TV show put on small screens. The show that will, after you've finished it, live you empty inside, because you'll never find another TV show that can rival it. With it's five seasons, The Wire raised the bar of quality for TV shows, the bar that no TV show to date has managed to reach. ",2016
10,"the wire is definitely the best show ever made. most realistic stuff ever. i takes a couple of episodes to get into it because it's pretty slow compared to the average show but once you get into it, you just become addicted. unlike other police shows this one deals with ONE investigation during its 4 entire seasons while in other shows cases are closed in one episode. another good thing about THE WIRE is that we follow both cops and thugs without any superficial caricature we find on CSI and such,THE WIRE keeps it real all the way. incredibly well written, amazing photography and oustanding actors, this is the kind of show that should be covered with emmies...",2005
9,"The Wire is an American crime drama television series set and produced in and around Baltimore, Maryland. Created and primarily written by author and former police reporter David Simon, the series was broadcast by the premium cable network HBO in the United States. The Wire premiered on June 2, 2002, and ended on March 9, 2008, comprising 60 episodes over five seasons.",2014
10,My wife gave me the complete series as a Christmas gift and although the television series is more than a decade old now I do not feel it has lost any of its relevancy regarding crime and human nature over this past decade or two.,2015
10,"The day 'The Wire' ended was a sad day to me. Having to see some of my favourite characters in any medium (novels, TV, movies, etc.) for the last time felt like saying goodbye to my friends. Knowing that I will never be so involved in a series ever again is saddening. At the same time, however, I'm proud that 'The Wire' was taken off the air before it could have been potentially bastardized like many series before it.",2008
10,"This is not just a TV series about cops and drug dealers in the city of Baltimore, this is a rich, nuanced fresco showing the reality of our society. It's complex, fascinating and exhausting, all in one. No clean cut characters, no good-guys / bad-guys, no straight forward stories. Each season deals with a different subject: illegal drug dealing, international criminal organisations, social problems related to drugs, political corruption, the media. All of it pictured with such attention to details, in such a realistic and unbiased way, supported by such high-quality acting and writing, that you can be sure you won't be disappointed at any time. The series is slow-cooking style, with little especial effects and a rather conventional editing. This might sound old-fashioned, but the approach to the themes and characters is so honest that the result is simply classical, timeless. I read somewhere that, if people want to know about society in the 19th century, they should read Dostojevsky, and if they want to know about society in our times, they should watch The Wire. There you go. Enjoy it.",2014
10,"Like most,when Breaking Bad ended I asked myself the question...""What now?"".",2014
10,"This is the only show i'm giving a 10. 10 is perfection, 10 should not be given lightly. But this show totally deserves it.",2014
10,When I watched the first two episodes I can't stand it. After 5-6 episodes I can't get enough of it. After 2 seasons it was so real I felt like I was living in it. I've never seen a TV series like this and I doubt I ever will. ,2014
10,"I am 39 years old and honestly can say THE WIRE is the best show I have EVER watched on television. Admittedly, I am not half the TV junkie as some of my friends but I can tell you this: NOTHING comes close and in my opinion, this show is a MUST SEE. I never even heard of the show until I chanced upon several very positive critical reviews of it in some mens magazines. On a hunch and a whim, I immediately joined NETFLIX and proceeded to watch all 4 seasons in 3 weeks time. Please, do yourself a favor, and do the same thing. I am NOT endorsing NETFLIX, I am just saying whatever method you choose to acquire the series, you MUST start at EPISODE 1, SEASON 1 and I DEFY you not to finish the entire anthology.",2008
9,"Another top notch show in HBO's arsenal. I'm not a big fan of the Hill Street Blues, hard core cop kind of show but it's impossible not to enjoy this series. You get plenty of material from the bad guys as well. You get a really good, realistic (in my amateur opinion) look at what it's like to be a homicide cop and it's rough. You also get a decent look at the other side, the hierarchy of people who commit the crimes. Does a really good job of spreading the story around, covering all the bases. Some seasons were better than others - I enjoy watching the drug trade more than city officials bickering with each other - but the acting is spot on across the board. If you're an HBO show fan, this series is a must-see. Right there with the best of them.",2014
10,"This show blew me away. The beauty of the production, the detail in the sets, the well written characters, the intelligent stories and concepts, the fun, the drama, and the excitement all amazed me. I don't usually spend time watching TV, but I honestly hated having to wait until the next show! :)",2004
10,"As with BtVS, the world is divided into people who get Firefly and people who don't. In this series Joss Whedon created one of the most realistic post-war visions of the future ever committed to tape, that at the same time spoke about yesterday and today. Maybe a little too much today for its own good.",2004
10,"Firefly was easily the best sci fi show Fox developed aside from the X-Files. It had science fiction staples spaceships, laser pistols, and tech, but also a nice retro quality of frontier western speech, horses, and guns. The humor alone made this one of the best shows on television. The Joss Whedon ability to spin a familiar plot convention/line in a surprising direction and the top notch cast of talented and charismatic actors help make this cancelled science fiction Fox casualty a cult favorite and upcoming movie. While the discussion about why it was cancelled and who was to blame is up for debate, no one can argue 200,000 in DVD secondary market sales to date. Clearly, Firefly was a show that deserved a chance to shine and with it's incarnation next year as a film, will allow this phoenix to rise again.",2004
10,"First off I should say that I only watched this as I read it had replaced Dark Angel (which I kind of liked, first series anyway) and wanted to see if it was any good.  Anyway, I've just finished watching the last episode of Firefly here in the UK, and I am thoroughly appalled that this series has been cancelled.  The ONLY bad things I can say about it is that *occasionally* the western parts seemed a bit contrived, and that I never really got to identify with some characters much (Wash and Preacher mainly).",2003
10,"I became a fan of BtVS January 1, 2002. I realise that at this time I was slightly behind, as well as on Angel, but I managed to recap all the episodes I missed (from FX and computer downloads and the such) and I was amazed at how wonderfully crafted these two shows were. Everytime a new DVD comes out for Buffy or Angel, I HAVE to pick it up within the first week of its release date.",2004
10,I've just watched the series for the third time in two years. This show is great. What an eclectic group of characters and an eclectic show. Space travel and cowboys. Wow. It is so fun.,2016
10,"Cidade de Deus seems to have a lot of praise on the IMDb boards, and with good reason too. It simply is, in my opinion, one of the best contemporary films ever made.",2004
10,"The film revolves around the, 'City of God,' a favela (or ghetto) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, a horrifying area where drug dealers run the community, and where children killing children is not an uncommon occurrence. ",2004
10,"Do not be fooled by the coy charm of the promotional poster. The image of the girl shyly leaning over to kiss the cheek of a bare-backed boy on golden sands drenched in sunlight represents an ideal that many residents of the City of God strive for, but few achieve. ",2004
10,"The film, directed by Fernando Meirelles, tells the story of life in the slums of Rio de Janeiro, in an area known as the Cidade De Deus, the City of God.  The story is told from the narration of the young photographer, Rocket.  The different scenarios of life that make up the wider-story are presented in Pulp Fiction style chapters, complete with on-screen titles for each different story component.  The story covers all the facets of the life, charting the growth of several key members of the gangs from childhood through to young adulthood, with their transformation from young hoodlums to local drugs barons.  The final parts of the story focus on the battle within the Cidade De Deus between two different groups, when business and personal matters lead to an unavoidable confrontation.  And what a confrontation it is, although details will not be given away here.  The result is a powerful telling of life based around real-life events.",2003
10,"I have seen this movie only recently (2005) and it's easily one of the better foreign films I have seen. Actually, it's probably just about one of the best films I had ever seen.",2005
10,"I knew nothing of this film before I saw it by chance in a rare Pub open screening, but boy was I glad I got the chance to take a look. I was riveted all night - I completely ignored my friends! I thought it was an awesome re-enactment of a true story - powerful, moving, raw, real - and even funny in parts. I walked away afterwards, beaming. It's rare a great film like this is made, especially these days. I gave it ten out of ten. Please see it if you can.",2003
10,"I am a big fan of foreign film, because its great to see directors with different points of view than the average American director. City of God is the epitome of a great foreign film. It shows the classic struggle between right and wrong, in a brand new way. The raw directing style, coupled with a great soundtrack makes for a movie which many different kinds of people can enjoy. Weather your a Harvard intellectual or the local idiot, you can enjoy this. The vicious cycle of the gangster lifestyle is portrayed with haunting accuracy. It even forces the audience to sympathize with some of the nastiest thugs in the world. All in all, City of God is one the greatest movies of my time and each time i watch it i enjoy it more than the last.",2004
8,"Wow, this is one of those different movies - meaning not run-of-mill by any means - and one of those which isn't pleasant to watch but one you might find yourself mesmerized by it.",2006
5,"I finally got around to watching this much praised movie, and I can certainly understand why so many people have found it fascinating. It is very well done in a technical aspect, and it's easy to be seduced by the way it looks and the constant flow of action scenes, not very different from the efficiency of some glossy & clever commercial. It also shows a way of life and a part of the world that is not very well known to many outsiders, thereby invoking some sense of illumination. Unfortunately, looking beyond the interesting setting & the glossy surface there's not a lot to be found. ",2007
7,"This film has been executed with considerable skill - 10/10 for visual and storytelling style. It is brilliant, expert and flawless in its execution.",2005
10,"The first moment of the film shows us a swaggering gangster preparing food somewhere in the Favella of Rio de Janeiro. A knife scrapes across a whetstone, a chicken is plucked, fabulously atmospheric music plays in the background and a second chicken makes a break for his life! A chase ensues, the poor chicken being pursued by a whole gang of hoods, armed to the teeth, and the frenzy stops with our hero (Rocket) being caught between heavily armed Policemen, the chicken and the hoods. Violence seems inevitable, and things look bad for Rocket...",2005
5,"Many consider a movie outstanding just because it shows tragic poverty and violence. Subconsciously, people feel ""politically correct"" for liking it. Praise becomes a form of self- elevation, whilst the mere, unnecessary styling offends the topic's intrinsic seriousness. The ideological showcase overcomes an honest presentation. Mixing tragic elements to create a shocking, poignant movie is easy. But somehow the whole thing becomes a farce too pretentious to be positively assessed. An unpunished, 10 year old killer runs around, kills everyone and then bursts into evil laughs. The horrifying situation exists in reality. But a film approach ought to be different. This film has been sold as a kind of triumph of the human spirit, yet it's no more than a typical mobster movie sited at Jacarepaguá. Scene after scene, someone is killed and the deaths have the same depth or significance of a video game. The protagonist does nothing to improve himself. He is a social victim, period. He features the moral character of a robot. And banditry, to the Brazilians' 'delight,' recruits untouchable children as hoods. A Guy Ritchie-like gang plot has its moments of shock: non stop bloodbaths & revolting human filth. For those fond of Grand Guignol, this is a perfect movie. Horrible and cheap in all aspects, including pain and suffering. Simply pathetic, filmed as an elegant commercial edited with rather annoying camera movements. City of God was just another product from the Third World that dazzled the radical chic community of the First World.",2013
10,"The story begins in the present days, in a barbecue party in the slum of 'Cidade de Deus', with some bandits chasing a chicken. Then, a teenager called Buscapé (Alexandre Rodrigues) tells the story of the Cidade de Deus and the main characters of the movie (Zé Pequeno, Bené, Cenoura etc.), since they were kids. ",2003
1,"Nowadays some consider a movie to be phenomenal as long as it shows tragical poverty and violence. It is so distinct from their lives that they unconsciously feel ""educated"" by seeing the film; praising the film therefore becomes a way of self-elevation.",2009
6,"I cannot say it is a bad movie. Actually it is one of the best i have seen lately... I went to the movies when the movie first came to my country, I didn't like it very much. Yesterday I wanted to see it again, because may be i couldn't understand it when i was 16 or 17 when i first saw it. I played the DVD tonight, and yes, i really hadn't catch quite the movie 5 years ago. Now I did, but that doesn't made me love it. Yes, the story was quite original and the director did a good job, but in my opinion this isn't enough for a movie to qualify in the top 20 of the greatest movies here... Leandro Firmino(Li'l Ze) performs great and deserves a high praise, but can it really compare to the performance of, for example, Al Pacino in Heat (160 positions under City of God in Top250). This is ridiculous. It is quite unfair that foreign language movies are rated so high, just because they are not American. I really don't mean to offend anyone. I still think the movie is good, but still cannot compare to much more valuable movies which even didn't make it to the top250. As I already said it is just an average gangster movie. And please don't judge my opinion, cause everyone has the right to like or not like a movie, no matter if it is in the top20...",2007
3,"There are certain people who have developed a very negative view towards Hollywood movies and U.S. cinema. In this mindset, any movie coming from the US is automatically lambasted, while non-US cinema is praised without merit. City of God, or Cidade de Deus, is one such case. Its serious overvaluing can only be attributed to a cloudy-eyed sentimentalism for the real situation behind the movie without even considering whether the movie itself has value in portraying that situation. And the unfortunate case is, no. Meirelles and Luns' generic directing is completely devoid of feeling and insight, and the actors are merely going through the motions, lacking any emotional impact in the actual proceeding of the screenplay. For these failings, the film collapses into a jiltingly generic mashup of violence and crime, with nothing to tell. There is no shock value, there is no empathy, there are no thoughts evoked. Perhaps this movie has some appeal and bearing to people who are more closely connected to Brazil and the kind of events portrayed, seeing as they can draw from another experience to put some weight into the matter, for this film by itself has none. It takes a special kind of pretentiousness and self-delusion to rate this film highly on its own merits, and the kind of a critic that dares not criticize a film with a sensitive subject. Yet this film desperately needs more of a voice of reason to call it for the empty shell it is.",2007
9,"There are many films that don't live up to the hype they are afforded, particularly modern day films. 'City of God', directed by Fernando Meirelles is not one of them. From the moment the film began until halfway through the closing credits, my eyes did not leave the television once. Based on a true story, 'City of God' spans two decades and is about rival street gangs in the town Cidade de Deus (City of God), just outside of Rio de Janeiro. The city is one where the government sends the 'unwanted' residents of Rio, so most of the inhabitants are homeless, criminal and/or dirt poor. The story is told through the eyes of Rocket, a young boy who manages to stay on the outer fringe of the gangs, befriending some of the hoods, but not participating. What he discovers he wants to do is become a photojournalist, and begins to take photographs of his neighborhood. When he is in his late teens/early twenties, he goes to work delivering newspapers, when one of his photographs of the slum gang boss is discovered and published without his permission, putting his life in danger, but beginning his professional career.",2004
1,Was what I just watched really the film all the hype was about? I really can't believe what makes people be so shallow and appreciate that movie- like crap. Was that a movie actually in the first place or just an emotionless documentary about Brazilian crime-stricken streets? I'm asking because I really don't know and am still wondering how come such an abject movie can even get so famous and be rated so high in IMDb.,2009
1,"I was really disappointed with this film. It is sold as a sort of triumph of the human spirit film, but it is more like a typical mafia gangster film transplanted to Brazil and the seventies. I was waiting for the Godfather to come out any minute and say ""He takes out a knife, yah take out a gun."" Scene after scene is of someone getting killed and the deaths have all the depth and meaning of a pixel creature getting shot in a video game. This film entertains on the most base level and has no depth whatsoever.",2006
8,"The most moving moment in a trip I made to Brasil occurred when I visited a community school in the slums (favelas). These children were desperately trying to better themselves  the school (paid for from community and rotararian funds with no government help) was their *only* chance to get out of the cycle of hopelessness and crime. The awful dilemma was that the community and its inhabitants were protected and supported (with no strings attached) by the local drugs and gun running infrastructure. I was safer there than on the streets of Copacabana  no-one would harm a tourist as that might attract police attention (bad for business). One infraction to law and order would mean a warning  the second, death.",2003
8,"""Gangs of New York"" takes us back to a time when America was a young country and New York was divided.  Those who felt they were ""native"" Americans did not want immigrants to enter their great country, spawning hatred between groups all over the city where many of them landed.  In the story we see how much of the town is run by one man, with William Cutting (""Bill the Butcher,"" played marvelously by Daniel Day-Lewis) being the most feared and well-respected man of the ""five Points.""",2004
1,"I waited for the DVD release before I saw this, and I was glad I did. The rental was a lot cheaper than a theater ticket would have been, and I was able to pause the DVD for a stretch break or a little walk when needed, which, sadly, was often. If a story line can catch your interest then the time can fly by, this story line was just so excessive and so overly violent and chock full of character quirks and craziness that time slogged on slow as a mouse in molasses. Other people have said similar, the characters were so despicable, disgusting, dehumanizing, that you really didn't give a rat's rear about any of them. There were one or two decent-to-good performances, but the rest of them you had to figure were cast for name value or because they had something on Scorcese that he didn't want made public. Potential spoiler --- when Leo DiCaprio gets his face slashed in the knife fight, so badly that he is truly horrible to look at, you never really see the supposed slash, and within a day or so he looks like he may have slept on a chenille bedspread and gotten a line or two on his face, but not the side-show ogre they would have had you believe. Was there too much concern that mar his pretty boy puss and the preteens will exit the theater? I think Leonardo has some definite talent (witness him in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"") but come on, he was slashed and stabbed in a knife fight, and in a day or two looks only as if someone had woken him early from his nap and he was a wee bit cranky. Scorcese -- you should be ashamed for this travesty.",2006
8,"For about three months now, I have (on an almost daily basis) passed a movie theatre not far from my home. On the side of this movie theatre is a huge poster advertising the movie ""Gangs of New York"". Meanwhile, all I heard about on television was the buzz about the upcoming ""Gangs of New York"". So, when this highly publicized movie finally opened, I went and saw it.",2002
8,"Daniel Day-Lewis elevates this film from just ""good"" to ""very good"" or even ""excellent."" He is absolutely riveting, one of the most interesting ""villains"" I have ever seen on film. I am sorry Day-Lewis didn't win the Academy Award for his performance. He was just outstanding to watch. His facial expressions alone cracked me up!",2005
6,"I am a Civil War ""buff,"" so I wanted to see this movie the moment I heard it was being made.  Yes, the New York Draft Riots did happen, just two weeks AFTER the Northern victory at Gettysburg, demonstrating that the outcome of the War was anything but certain, even after Lee had been forced to retreat to the south bank of the Potomac River.  Today, many would find this surprising.",2003
2,"Along with so many people, I had waited for this movie to come out, but for a different reason. I have studied the Five Points at great length and wanted to see how Scorcese would deal with the subject. I was never more disappointed than when I left the theater after this drivel.",2005
1,"First of all, the movie is way too long. Parts of it are really boring.",2005
1,"When I first heard of Gangs of New York, my first impression is that it wasn't going to be that good. But I decided to challenge my preconceptions, before they challenged me (Enterprise; Strange New Worlds; Season 1). So I rented it and watched it, but it was a hell of a lot worse than my preconception.",2005
10,"Well, I just got back from seeing ""Gangs of New York"" at the theater, and I have many positive things to say about this film.  It's easily the most powerful film I've seen this year, even topping the excellent ""White Oleander"".  I have never seen a film portray poverty in the 1800's as well as this film did.  It also made me feel like I was there, witnessing the poverty and brutality.  It's a film that makes us be thankful that times like those have passed, and for us not to forget those who lived and died during those times.  It's also a film that's not afraid to show war in its total uglyness.  Martin Scorsese definately got his point across with this film, but he didn't do it alone.  The cast were all excellent in their parts, no bad acting here at all.  Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz showed they are more than just pretty faces.  Daniel Day-Lewis was magnificent as ""The Butcher"", a character whom you want to both love and hate.  Quite simply the best film I've seen all year, and I hope it will get nominated (and win) many Oscars.  Even if it doesn't, it's a true winner in my eyes. Nice to see that Hollywood can actually do something useful with a $100million budget for once.  This was playing at the theater the same time as ""The Two Towers""... unfortunately, most of the people in the long line-up went to see ""TTT""... they sure missed out, since GONY has more to say in the first 10 minutes than LOTR has to say over 3 hours.  Although this film is rather long (2 hrs 47 mins), I was so provoked by it that the time flew by. ""Gangs of New York"".... A film that's not to be missed!!",2003
1,"Whatever you do, do not waste your dough on this trash. They say it's directed by Martin Scorsese, but it was obviously directed by Kevin Costner. Think *WaterWorld* without the pleasant diversion of being able to look at the ocean. Not only is it pointlessly violent (and I'm a guy who doesn't at all mind the occasional decapitation or disemboweling as someone is telling me a story), but my god is this moving BORING!",2003
1,"I went to 'Gangs' on Christmas day with a large group of family.  A few fell asleep, and some of us wish we had.  This was a terrible show!  Zero character development, no plot, and gratuitous violence.  Now, I'm okay with the violence if it is relevant to the story, but there was no story here. Out of the ten, or so, I saw this show with, one liked it.  The rest of us wanted the last three hours back.  What a terrible waste of our holiday.",2002
1,"It appears Mr. Scorsese has reached end of the road.  He has nothing to say and thinks bloodbath after bloodbath will hold our interest.  His story is poorly set up, and told.  The graphic violence is repulsive, and so continuous, boring.  The filmmaker manages to involve the civil war so he can intertwine even more deaths.  Mr. Scorsese has spent a lot of time thinking about death; he should spend some time thinking about life.  Too bad this once talented man can't return to the art of filmmaking.",2002
1,"What can be said of a film where the best scenes were the few seconds at the end, where the New York skyline morphed from the slums of Five Points to the skyline pre September 11, 2001. ",2002
2,"It begins, unfolds, and ends with violence. True, there was much tension and wasted lives during the mid-nineteenth century New York centered around Tammany Hall and Five Points.",2005
7,"""Gangs of New York"" mixes real American history with a weak fictional human drama and a thick coat of Hollywoodization resulting in an over wrought behemoth wannabe epic misfire. Scorcese pulls together bits and pieces of the Civil War  conscription act, Irish potato famine immigration, Tammany Hall  and Tweed corruption, race/slave issues, slum gangs, etc. and creates a milieu which has an off-target post-apocalyptic sort of feel and then tries to cram DiCaprio down our throats as a hero though he does nothing particularly heroic in the context of the film. The flick features blood and guts street riots reminiscent of ""Braveheart"", a romance which doesn't work, an evil guy over acted by Day-Lewis and little else save a whole bunch of filler to give us a taste of the times and milk the extravagance for all its worth. In spite of all that, ""Gangs..."" received several Oscar noms and a thumb and a half up from critical corners with so-so approval from the public. Okay for fans of the principals and others into Hollywood blockbusters. Not for the jaded or those looking for substance or sophistication. (B)",2003
1,"Whatever you do, don't waste your dough on this piece of crap. They say it's directed by Martin Scorsese, but it was obviously directed by Kevin Costner. Think *WaterWorld* without the pleasant diversion of being able to look at the ocean. Not only is it pointlessly violent (and I'm a guy who doesn't at all mind the occasional decapitation or disemboweling as someone is telling me a story), but it is boring.",2003
1,How did this movie get all these awards?   We found it excruciating slow and painful to watch.   It was all about shots of the period.  They must have spent a fortune on the sets.   No real script that kept your attention. Very long too.   We got more out of the half hour extra from the Discovery channel on the DVD that told you everything you needed to know.,2003
1,"Are you kidding me? This film was nominated for Oscars? Of all the junk over the years that has been nominated and has won Oscars this has got to be one of the worst yet! First of all is the actors; Leonardo DiCaprio has no business ever playing a tough guy kind of role. DiCaprio is so girlish that he is laughable as anyone who would be in a knife fight and should stick to roles where he plays either gay character or someone who is just very fem. DiCaprio seems right at home in a sappy love story such as Titanic or as a mentally handicapped person such as his role in What's Eating Gilbert Grape. As if Leon wasn't bad enough we have to deal with 166 minutes of Daniel Day-Lewis looking like a bum and acting like a confused mime. I can't think of a movie where an actor or actress has failed more miserably in a part as Daniel Day-Lewis did in this movie; he was in a word, Laughable. Now as if the two main characters failing so utterly was not enough there are several other things which make this movie near unbearable. Of this list the first thing that comes to mind is the silly costumes which although somewhat authentic for the period were over-done and seen far too much. An example of this was the ten-gallon hats. Yes, people wore them back then but in this movie almost everyone had one on which would be like someone 140 years from now making a movie which takes place in 2003 and the same percentage of people as were wearing ten-gallon hats in this movie were wearing baseball caps. The next most annoying thing about Gangs of New York was the music; the same perpetual square dancing music played over and over again as if they just couldn't come up with something better. Moving right along we come to another very annoying `feature' . the accents done by DiCaprio and Day-Lewis, neither of which sounded anything like they should; aren't actors by definition supposed to, well, ACT?! Let's face it here people, if Leonardo DiCaprio wasn't in this movie along with Scorsese directing it, but rather had an unknown set of lead actors and actresses with an unknown director orchestrating this whole farce, this movie not only would have never gotten a single Oscar nomination but probably would have went directly to cable or video. The only upside to this whole fiasco was perhaps the cinematography and the story. This movie had a lot going for it but was ultimately doomed by the bad acting, poor casting, hilarious costume design, annoying music and boat load of other things that sank this ship before it ever left the harbor . 3 out of 10 stars for this catastrophic calamity.",2003
1,"An overlong, highly episodic excuse for some burlesque and indulgent violence masquerading part-time as a film of historical interest and validity. With Leonardo scowling, Diaz giggling and Day Lewis doing his best De Niro, this film takes itself far too seriously for the leaden-handed and juvenile treatment of a story which seems suspect the moment you think about it. Its a shame to see a director with such a great track-record try so hard to convince us that he's still 'got it'. Couldn't he have left this drekk to Jerry Bruckheimer?",2003

The 1st hour is pure laugh out loud fun (the adults in my Cinema audience were shouting with laughter!). The last hour is scary, wand dropping tension.",2002

8,"Not being a fan of the Harry Potter Movies, I toddled along to the first showing of this movie at my local UGC Cinema and sat down and thirly enjoyed this movie, but not in the way that I would enjoy something like the Lord of The Rings or Spider-Man. Of course Harry Potter's target audience is of a younger age so I can see how I might not have enjoyed it as much as a slightly younger audience, but to say the least it is a lot better than some of the crap that is fizzled out these days.

7,"A lot has been made about the pubescence of the three leads in this new Harry Potter installment and it is a bit disconcerting when Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) speak their first lines in those awkward cracks of pre-adolescence.  However, their growing up, along with the physical blossoming of their friend Hermione (the perky and smart actress Emma Watson) seem mark a general growing up of the whole Harry Potter series.  This one is more for grown-ups:  the first one hooked the kid demographic and no doubt they will still be enraptured by ""Chamber of Secrets.""  This is the film, however, that hopes to attract a whole new audience in the parents of those kids.  It is darker and has more layers. The explanations about wizardry are less cursory and the acting seems stronger.",2002
8,"Having done a good job with the first Harry Potter flick, one shouldn't be surprised Chris Columbus was asked to direct the sequel as well. And the second film actually improves on its predecessor, getting a little edgier and less children-friendly (two factors that raise exponentially with each new installment), even though it does repeat an old mistake in certain places.",2005
8,"I thought this was better than the first Harry Potter movie because it didn't overdo the action scenes as the first film did, and the special-effects were better. It's not ""Lord Of The Rings,"" of course, but it's still decent entertainment, even for us older folks. It got even better with the third installment, which has been my personal favorite of the four I've seen now.",2007
9,"Having three daughters I have a choice when a great book comes out:  buy three of them (EXPENSIVE!!), force someone to wait until the other is done before they can read the book (sure, I enjoy breaking up fights!), or read it to them.  I chose to read it to them so we could ALL enjoy it...and we did!  Naturally, the kids were excited when the movie came out.  However, when I saw the first Harry Potter, I was terrified it was going to be ""butchered"" like most ""books to movies"" are; but was pleasantly surprised by the relatively ""stick to the book"" script it displayed.  Sure, some things were left out undoubtedly due to time constraints, but overall, it conveyed the story well.",2003
10,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is superb, and don't listen to those narrow-minded critics who claim otherwise. Those who said it is superior to the first film are right: Philosopher's Stone was wonderful but the sequel does for Harry Potter what the Empire Strikes Back did for Star Wars - elevate it to a higher level where it will be regarded as a masterpiece in it's own right.",2002
7,"The second installment seems to carry on where the first left off. All previous characters return and then some!! The grandiose majesty of Harry Potter continues with new tricks, new delights and little treats that can be taken for granted. At times I find the Harry Potter world has so many wonderful things happening at the same time that you tend to overlook the smaller things (ergos the Weasley's residence and the great Hall) The Chamber of Secrets is a darker tail but is well within the tolerances of most children's ability to handle. The creatures are excellent, the overall story is easy enough to follow, though some aspects have to be explained to younger children.",2006

5,"The second in the Harry Potter franchise, 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' was clearly intended for small children. While this approach did work with 'The Philosopher's Stone' as the happy, Disney -esque atmosphere reflected Harry's idealism of a wizarding world that was perfect, a slightly moody and mature tone would have been far more suitable for CoS since this is when our Boy Who Lived starts to realise the darker side of being a wizard and being a hero. In this film, twelve-year-old Harry is now in his Second Year at Hogwarts when the school is subjected to mysterious attacks that leave Muggleborn students incapacitated. Harry, Ron and Hermione quickly learn a creature is stalking the school, a monster that lives in a secret chamber and was once responsible for the death of a child.",2006

It has an appeal for the whole family, as does the first one, and it has some charm and excitement in its Quiddich battle scenes, but it isn't really always the sort of material that might stay with you long after it's over (unless, of course, you're a hardcore fan). It works at best in the form of the atypical sequel: same characters that like Potter just as much- his closest friends Ron and Hermonie- and those that don't like Snape and Malfoy. ",2007

10,"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was a wonderful movie, just as good as the first. The acting I have to say was much better. Some parts were left out but it followed the book way more than the first one did. The actors that were choosen for this movie worked very well and Kenneth Branagh did a wonderful job as Gilderoy Lockhart. The only problem I had with it is that it was a little slow. It took awhile for somethings to get moving but that is alright. Everything just worked very well and the music was wonderful, just as good as the first. Over all I would give this movie an A+++ and for those who didn't like it (I don't tell people how to controll their opinions but...) your crazy. No it's ok not everyone has to like it. But I very much enjoyed it for being such an avid movie buff it was WONDERFUL!!",2002
10,"If movies are suppose to effect the viewer then this movie is king of the hill. From the dis-orienting camera moves that open the film  through the violence in the gay bar, the seemingly never ending rape and the films unraveling of the days events in a backwards march I have yet to meet anyone who has not been deeply effected by this movie - if they were brave enough or stupid enough to watch it.

10,"A few months ago while I was going through the message boards on IMDb, someone was talking about disturbing films and one that seemed to come up the most was a film called Irreversible. This film has come up in discussion so many times when the subject of disturbing film is brought to attention. When I think I've seen the worst of the worst, I figured I should see what Irreversible had to offer. I have to admit after watching this movie, it stayed with me. Definitely not being the easiest movie to watch, Irreversible has a style to it and a very disturbing story that can haunt many for different reasons. Wither it's the extreme violence, the cursing, the drugs or the 9 minute rape scene, Gasper Noe takes you into this very dark world and doesn't let you go.",2010
8,"I have been watching movies for decades, and as far as I remember, only three movies have disturbed me. The first one was `Soldier Blue', when I was a teenager, explicitly showing the massacre of the American Indians. Later, in 1982, `Sophie's Choice', when a mother has to decide which son shall remain alive. `Irreversible', which I saw yesterday, was the third one. The storyline is very simple: In Paris, a young couple goes to a party with a friend by subway. They discuss, and the woman decides to return back home alone. She is violently raped in an underground passage. Her husband and her friend decide to make justice by themselves.  What makes the difference in this polemic movie? First of all, like in `Memento', the story is presented backwards, in a reverse chronology, from the credits to the beginning. Although not being original, unfolded this way, the story shocks much more. Then, the cruelty of at least two very explicit scenes (the rape of Alexandra and the aggression and crime of Pierre in the gay night-club) are amazingly well choreographed and real. The beginning of the film, with the camera spinning randomly, and a weird soundtrack, makes the viewer sick and so disoriented and disturbed as Marcus, the character of Vincent Cassel. Therefore, technically this film is outstanding. The performance of the cast and the direction, photography and soundtrack are stunning. Living in Rio de Janeiro, a violent city, the story is very real and scary, and that is why it shakes up more than a horror movie. We never believe that this situation may happen to ourselves or to our friends, but the daily newspaper shows many similar examples. The idea of the irreversibility of time and its destruction, the same way of the lives of the characters in this movie, is fantastic. Certainly a very sensitive person will be sick and will not like this movie. The box of the DVD should advise that this story is  recommended to a specific audience. My vote is eight.",2004
8,"A lot has been said about this movie. Yes, there are a couple of brutal and violent scenes. It's even hard to watch at times, but Irreversible is much more than that.",2004
8,"Holy Macaroni! Believe the hype, folks...this really IS one of the most shocking, confronting and raw movies ever made! It actually is one of those rare purchases that makes you wonder what the role of cinema is in modern society. Irréversible certainly can't be classified as 'entertainment', that's for sure. It merely looks like a brutal eye-opener, highly unpleasant to watch at times and it sometimes makes you even feel ashamed to be human! Some of the stuff here goes beyond your most feared nightmares and could easily provoke depression, anti-social behavior and anxiety among influential viewers. It's real-life drama and that makes it so powerful and shocking. Irréversible is told backwards, 'Memento'-style if you wish...only it's a lot more effective here as it was in Memento, which actually was a pretty boring and extremely overrated movie. This very simple backwards-structure aspect gives Irréversible the opportunity to implement a couple of unique and rarely seen style elements. The first half hour (which actually is the end of the story) smacks you in the face right away sets the tone for a non-stop, raw experience. Also, you don't really get to know the characters until the last chapter (which is actually the beginning of the film) The characters are a riddle to you constantly and you can't symphatise with any of them, since you just know too little. Through wild camera movements and simplistic techno-music, a claustrophobic and horrifying atmosphere gets created and the violence is really hard to digest. The infamous scene in which Monica Belluci brutally gets raped is one of the most perverted things I've ever seen. It seems to go on forever and you can really visiualise the painful hell the poor girl is going through. I'd call Irréversible a successful combination of ancient, rough exploitation and modern art-house film-making. The brutality portrayed here is typical for the euro-shock cinema but the stylish shooting lifts it up to Cannes Festival material. Cult as pure as it comes!",2004
10,"Argentinian born French film maker Gaspar Noé is already one of the most important and powerful film makers of all time. His 1998 debut feature film Seul Contre Tous is an unforgettably merciless but also so uniquely rewarding depiction of rotten society with even more rotten human beings that inhabit it with their selfishness and potential to violence and revenge - those things that everyone feels sometimes, more or less often, and things that only create more of them when not kept inactive and off. The last 15 minutes of Seul Contre Tous include some of the most unimaginably brilliant editing and camerawork (including a body-mounted camera and clever communication/estranging with the unsuspecting audience) not to speak of the soundtrack, which force us to see the truth about ourselves and things around us. Those mentioned elements are also the same that stamp the work of Japanese film maker Shinya Tsukamoto (Tetsuo in 1988, Gemini in 1999) who is also a friend of Noé. These two directors do most of the important parts of their film making themselves (camera operating, editing, directing, writing..) and both have the talent to smash the viewer straight to the face and force him and her to think and even change towards something better. Now Noé has even surpassed his power and moment of total breathlessness of Seul Contre Tous with his 2002 film Irréversible, a masterpiece that has the same ability to change people's lives and attitudes towards a better world, but with the kind of power of imagery and soundtrack that only few, unfortunately, as films like these deserved more attention and respect, are willing to accept and understand.",2003
10,"I am very surprised to see all of the negative complaints towards this film.Like ""I Spit on Your Grave"" or ""I Stand Alone"",""Irreversible"" is only rubbish to those who don't understand it,or don't want to understand it.Gaspar Noe tells us the story about love and revenge-a pregnant young woman(outstanding Monica Bellucci)is violently raped and tortured in the underground passage.Her boyfriend(Vincent Cassel)desperately tries to find her rapist to kill him.The infamous Monica Bellucci's anal rape scene is truly brutal and sickening,but at least the film can't be accused of eroticizing,trivializing or glamourizing rape,something many mainstream movies are guilty of.It actually shows that rape is a brutal and disgusting act.Congratulations should go to this stunningly beautiful actress for her brave performance.It's obvious that women should be treated with respect,unfortunately this is the kind of a sexual violence women are dealing with everyday and everywhere.In that case Cassel's savage behaviour is completely justified.The scenes in ""Rectum"" are genuinely nightmarish and infernal.The film will leave you shaken and desolated,so if you want to see something totally mind-shattering,then ""Irreversible"" is a must-see.An absolute 10 out of 10.",2003
7,"I'm a sucker for film-world hype--always have been, and probably always will be. When I stumble across a film that is so controversial it inspires both gasps of horror and cheers of praise, I flock to it. There is something intriguing about film's capacity to house unpleasantness, and just how far a director will go in conveying his message (it's always interesting to see whether or not they have a justified reason for the excess). ""Irreversible,"" the backward-structured film from French shock auteur Gaspar Noe (""I Stand Alone"") spins you out of control with as much regularity as his camera and characters will allow. It's a curious piece of work designed to provoke the audience--at the beginning, you're disoriented and confused (and, if you're like me, getting carsick from the deliberately erratic camera movements), and even repulsed by the actions of the unfamiliar characters hassling the patrons of a seedy homosexual club, a sequence that ends with a ghastly murder. Okay, then, so what? Clearly the rest of the movie is going to give us an explanation...but would the film have had a similar effect if it were told in a straightforward manner? Is the backward motion of ""Irreversible"" just a gimmick used by Noe (who is not immune from snobbery and pretension) to draw attention to his film? It's hard to say. Personally, I reject the notion of the reverse storyline being used as a gimmick, simply because of how deliberately the previous pieces fit (certain passages of dialog, particularly a discussion of orgasms that serves as a prelude to one of the most horrifying rape scenes in film history); Noe certainly wasn't asleep in his construction of the film. ""Irreversible"" displays the type of oppressive misanthropy (the dialog is loaded with racial and homophobic slurs) evidenced in Noe's ""I Stand Alone"" (the tale of an out-of-work butcher driven to madness by everyone around him), but then pulls back from the hard-edged violence to show a tender humanity that might be even more startling, since the film could have easily played itself for nothing but shock value the entire time. ""Irreversible"" is an unsettling conundrum that guides us through the highs and lows of the human condition--it pushes buttons of morality, shows in graphic detail what others would only suggest, and brings us out the end of the tunnel exhausted, invigorated, and breathless. A stunning film, somewhat hampered by its excessive dialog.",2005

4,"Movies like this are all the same: show you a horrifically traumatic event, and let the viewer wallow in the depths of this tragedy. Worst of all, the filmmaker uses every trick in the book to toy with your emotions. Does it advance the story to make the woman pregnant? No. It only gives the viewer a heightened sense that the forthcoming event is going to be excruciating horrible. Does it advance the story to make the victim extremely beautiful and free spirited? Of course not. Yet Noe knows how that this, too, will affect the viewer. What about the couple in bed before the party foreshadowing their own fate? This trick is used to bring the viewer out of the bliss that they have been experiencing for the last 30 minutes or so and draw your attention back to the rape.",2004

9,"Director Gasper Noe is no stranger to controversy as his film prior to Irreversible ended up being censored for its containment of real, albeit blurred, porn images. The genius behind Irreversible then is the way in which it cleverly defies censorship through unfolding the action backwards and in single, uninterrupted takes forcing the audience to witness a climactic and terrifying beginning set against an almost optimistic and happier end.

But seeing it a 2nd time, I didn't care for it as much, in fact, I feel I've been had. Its impact is really felt the first time you see it, because seeing it the 2nd time, you realise a lot of things about it that aren't particularly good. Most of the dialogue is poor (most of it was improvised, and not very well), the violence of the film is purposely over the top, and Noe the director seems to delight in showing nasty stuff without really bringing a sense of art to it. He enjoys rubbing your face in the sleazy, horrific violence, but has no purpose other than saying ""life is brutal"". I can't deny that the film did have a great impact upon first viewing, but too often when one's sense are assaulted (like they are here), you can mistake that for great, artistic film-making. ",2008

There is nothing artistic or beautiful in this film, it is just disgusting and nauseating. What a horrible,horrible film. Gaspar Noé is a terrible filmmaker, who only made sick and disgusting films, like this and ""I Stand Alone"". ""Irreversible"" is one of the worst movies I've ever saw. It was so bad as things as ""Cannibal Holocaust"" or ""Caligula"". I don't recommend it to anyone.",2010
1,"I could not make it past the rape scene. That was was way too much to tell a story. It was one shot for what seemed like an eternity of a woman being violently raped in the rectum. This scene comes after a few sequences of a guy looking for a club called the Rectum... obvious in the first bit to be a homosexual club, of which the main character is trying to find because his woman was violently murdered. (and subsequently he also is violently murdered, at the beginning) I am not against any homosexual persons whatsoever, and I gave this movie a chance, but the seen with the woman being anally raped was just way too much. I had to actually shut it off and delete it from my hard drive (it was a purchased download). I am not weak of heart, weak of stomach, prudish or even religious, but that scene just really turned me off for the chance of seeing an actual story. Perhaps something happened later to redeem the movie, but I just couldn't keep watching it. Way too disturbing and violently gratuitous. Besides the ""unsteady camera technique"".

10,"""8 Mile"" is the new film that features controversial rapper Eminem in his first starring role.  The film itself is loosely based on his life growing up in Detroit.  Eminem plays Jimmy Smith, Jr. a.k.a. ""Rabbit"", a young man who is struggling to make things better for himself through ""battles"", which are freestyling rap contests that are usually held at a local nightclub. Rabbit chokes when it is his turn to take the microphone for the first time. His best friend, Future (Mekhi Phifer) is the host of these battles and strongly believes Rabbit has potential, but the problem is that Future often makes his decisions before consulting with Rabbit first.  Rabbit's home life is not much better.  He's broke, has no place to live, he's stuck in a dead-end job at a steel mill, and his girlfriend Janeane (Taryn Manning) has fooled him into thinking that she is pregnant.  Rabbit's mother (Kim Basinger), is on the verge of being evicted from her home and is slutting around with a man who is about the same age as her son.  Things in Rabbit's life take a turn for the better when he later falls in love with Alex (Brittany Murphy), an aspiring young woman who dreams of becoming a model and moving to New York to start life a new.",2002

He put on a great show, and kept me interested throughout the entire movie. Mekhi Phifer did an excellent job and is definitely a rising star in Hollywood. Brittany Murphy could have done a better job, but I didn't like her character development at all. It seems that she flip flops around so much that in the end you really don't know which side she truly plays. Kim Basinger did a good job. I don't watch too many of her movies. The last movie I saw of hers' was ""Bless the Child"" and that was a major let down.",2002
7,"8 Mile tells the story of a white kid on the wrong side of the tracks living in Detroit with a dead end job and a trailer park mom.  Deep inside, he aspires to break free from the chains of the reality of his life through the poetry and passion and rawness of rap; the one place he can possibly gain a feeling of purpose and hear his own voice.  Obviously, it's no big secret that this storyline runs very parallel to that of of Eminem's own roots and his own aspirations.  Where fiction and reality collide is blurred and that works for the picture.  First off, I think Curtis Hanson did a great job rebuilding that world and protecting his novice lead.  He understood the material and I was drawn in to the world that he recreated.  Also, the cinematography widely lends itself towards upping the ante of the picture and making you feel the authenticity of a world and a place where many of us have never traveled nor never will.  As for Eminem himself, at first I found him a little stoic, but given the fact that this guy has never acted before, regardless of how 'autobiographical' the material may be, I thought he did a decent job in front of the camera.  Hanson was wise to protect his lead with awesome supporting work from Mekhi Phifer and pretty much everyone else that portrays his friends and peers in the film.  Eminem obviously was a little green and surrounding him with these actors gave the movie and Eminem's journey more credence.  Brittany Murphy was also very good, but I found her character to be a bit expedient.  She definitely was not used to her full potential and I felt that if they had used her relationship with Rabbit to a larger or deeper extent, it only would have lent more to the film. One of the scenes I was most impressed with was the sex scene between Murphy and Eminem.  Gone were the Hollywood antics of glossing it up or ghetto fabulous and I felt that Hanson captured something that was fascinating, uncomfortable and realistic that I haven't seen in a Hollywood film before.",2002
10,"This movie is something that really refreshed the Hollywood studio.It's preety different than the other movies because of it's really interesting plot and great cast(including Eminem).I have to say that Eminem did an amazing job on his debut and that he really was fascinating in a role that is maybe very autobiographical.Phenomenal soundtrack including 50 cent and Xzibit and of course ""lose yourself""-the academy award winner.I think that the rap contest scenes are the best part of the movie, because they were made so realistic.After all, a movie that is surely creating maybe even an another genre in something that i called movie industry and a great try !",2006
10,"Watched this for the first time in 10 years recently. What a great film. A real statement of its time. Everything that was bad in the USA in the 1990's is perfectly illustrated, giving food for thought as well as inspiring empathy for a lost generation of young poor Americans. Living in Trailer parks, caught up in gangs - black against white.",2017

8,"The end credits rolled, and I made my mind up that the movie had dissapointed me, but 8 Mile is for the intelligent. Upon introspection, I realised that the very essence of 8 Mile was its non-flashy, keeping it real kind of setting. Honestly I expected a rags to riches story, but I got the exact opposite. The movie is the story about one and a half months in a young white man's life, where his mindset undergoes major change. When you realise that the movie is trying to show this, it starts to shine, when you realise the 'realness' of the movie it shines even more, and finally when you watch Bunny Rabbit walk of the screen with a peace sign in the air, no better than he was in the start, with 'Lose Yourself' jiving in the background, you know the movie is worth it. Watch the movie, enjoy the battle scenes, decide its nothing great, but then give it some thought, you'll see what I see. 8/10.",2002

10,"Curtis Hanson is turning out to be one of our great directors.  LA CONFIDENTIAL was a look at LA during the 1950's that was near perfection as far as films are concerned.  WONDER BOYS was a highly entertaining look at characters who live in PITTSBURGH, again the city was as much a character as any of the actors.",2002
10,"Eminem. The greatest rapper of all time! That's my opinion anyways, and a lot of others too. This movie, based on his life, the start of his career, is brilliant! I've seen it time and time again, and I'm going to keep seeing it until the end of time. Yes, it is that good! So believe me when I say, watch it dog, watch it today.",2013
7,"It's time for a Battle! Directed by Curtis Hanson, the movie is a semi-autobiographical account of Eminem's early years in Detroit, struggling to make ends meet and get his rap career off the ground. The film stars Eminem as Jimmy ""B-Rabbit' Smith, whom life isn't going anywhere. He can't seem to get any respect among with his peers after choking in a previous rap battle tournament. The only way, he could show the world, he meets business, is to sign up for a new rap battle and challenge the best rapper in Detroit, Papa Doc (Anthony Mackie), the leader of the local famous rap group gang 'Free World' and win it all. Will he win it? You got to watch it to find out. Without spoiling too much of the movie, the movie borderlines Eminem real life. Instead of the crazy Eminem Slim Shady that spit out hateful, violent, and somewhat silly lyrics, ranging from killing his wife, homophobia to making jokes about celebs. You really get a motivational type of a film about going after your dreams. You really see, Eminem as Jimmy grow into a positive responsibility for the direction of his life. It was very mature. Honestly, I don't think this movie would had work, if it's was all about moaning and groaning Slim Shady. I glad, Eminem took this seriously. After all, after this movie, his music had gotten more serious, and less Slim Shady like. Eminem even took an Oscar for Best Song that year for ""Lose Yourself"". It was the first time a rap/hip-hop song win an Academy Award reward. That's a big deal! Is Eminem, the best rapper? It's up in the air, depending what you think is music. After all, 2005's Encore & 2009's Relapse were some of his worst albums ever. Thank God for 2010's Recovery. But, it's still hard not to find yourself, jamming to ""Lose Yourself"" when you need a boost in your life. You can't help seeing how great, the raps were written in the film. My favorite one had to be the courtyard battle with the Xhibit cameo. Yeah, most of the raps were pretty funny and clever, both from Eminem and the lyrics from his real life friends, playing opponents like Proof who play Lil' Tic in the film. The acting is pretty good, all around. Eminem has never acted before this, but regardless of how 'autobiographical' the material may be, he did a great job. The supporting cast was pretty good for the most part. Mad props go to Mekhi Phifer as Jimmy's mentor, Future. Brittany Murphy as Alex, Jimmy's love-interest is mostly a miss than a hit for me. I don't find her attractive. Eminem-Murphy love scene in the plant was bit out of place. Taryn Manning's role as the ex-girlfriend is almost unnecessary. The only female character that really matter in this film, is the alcoholic mother (Kim Basinger) as she play a great dealt in Eminem's life. I did find the whole sub-plot of her losing her home, a bit underdeveloped, as surprising near the climax, she miraculous won the bingo in a deus ex machina like fashion. I did love the symbolism of the burning house in the state of present day Detroit. Indeed the movie demonstrates processes of race, class, and segregation in the urban lower socio-economic environment. Indeed, it's hard to be proud of your neighborhood, when there are streets upon streets of abandoned building where people do drugs, murder, and loot. You really see how economic devastation and de-industrialization can hurt a city. Most of the movie is how much living in Detroit sucks type patting, until the predictable Rocky style final battle. It should had been shorter than its 110 minute run time. Honestly, another thing that bug me is that the movie is place in 1995's Detroit, but there is little to no mention of the time period. They should just save money and claim it was present day, because when I first saw it, I thought it was year 2002 in the settling. For an Eminem movie, it's pretty tame in the language and the violence. Don't get me wrong, it's R Rating for a reason, but I really think the producers were going for a PG-13 rating here. Yes, there's a lot of harsh language, but it didn't seem oddly place. Overall: If you're looking for a good urban underdog movie. You found one.",2014

10,"Peter Jackson truly outdid himself when creating the Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and he fails to disappoint us in the 2nd part of the Trilogy. The Two Towers shows us that he is not a one-hit wonder, like so many directors are. I actually think that The Two Towers reaches the same level as the Fellowship of the Ring, and sometimes even surpasses it.",2010

10,"From the beginning to the very end, the Lord of the Rings trilogy is interesting and enjoyable. The books and the movies alike grasp one's attention as if they were real. You, the reader or viewer, can sense the pain of the characters, their emotions. The trilogy is truly powerful on screen. The second movie, however, I believe has something the first and third are missing; it feels like a bridge connecting two great islands. There is something unique about it that cannot easily be described. Metaphorically, the first movie is, say, a soldier. The third movie is the path home from war. And the second movie is the act of coming home because it contains the obstacles that must be passed through before achieving the goal. Although not 100% loyal to the written trilogy, the movies are done in such a way that the mainstream audience and LOTR fans from before the movies came out can say they were enjoyable and well made.",2004
10,"The opening scene of The Two Towers provides an outstanding, yet very brief, taste of action, cinematography, and special effects, only to be matched (and far surpassed) in the final hour of the film. The stunning events of the third hour of The Two Towers are undoubtedly the centerpiece of the film, and while the first two hours serve finely as story development, they primarily build anticipation for the final hour, which mostly depicts the battle of Helm's Deep. More than anything else, the first two hours merely tease and torment the patient audience. It's a shame that such a gap has to exist between the first minute and the final hour, but I take no reservations in saying that despite how you feel about the first two hours of the film, the final hour will make the wait entirely worth its while.",2002
10,"Really, I should probably let this film soak in a bit; I am, after all, on something of a ""post-viewing"" high right now. However, at this moment, my feeling remains the same from the first installment - this is the movie experience I've been waiting my whole life for. In case you haven't gathered, this movie is visually stunning, literally breathtaking. I mean that, some of the scenes in this film simply stopped my lungs in their tracks, shocked at the pure, enveloping beauty of the shot. Peter Jackson has a profound grasp of visual manipulation like few directors have ever had.",2002

Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli traverse the Riddermark into the realm of Rohan.",2005
10,"Watching this movie is like watching a 179 or 223 minutes long action sequence. The pace is incredibly high. Alright I have to admit that the Extended Edition of the ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" takes an awful lot of this pace away and make some of the scene's unnecessary long and the scene's with Treebeard are also a bit dull and long but still...Especially compared to the first that was just too slow at times this is an huge improvement!",2005
10,"Seriously, I never thought a movie could get better than the Fellowship of the Ring, but it did. This movie should be #1 on the IMDb top 250. This movie, as long as it was, captivated me from start to finish, and those who are not entertained by this movie can not be entertained period.",2002
10,"The Two Towers can only be explained in one word, beautiful.  This film left me breathless.  I was hoping for a film that could stand in the same depths of the Fellowship of the Ring, and I must say that it has surpassed the film completely.  I will have a hard time watching the Fellowship and seeing the ending, knowing there is so much more waiting.",2002

10,"Yes, it's true. Return of the King may have won more of the Oscars as the culmination of Peter Jackson's magnificent cinematic achievement, but history will in fact adjudge ""The Two Towers"" as the greatest of the three Rings. If Fellowship was a road movie and ROTK was a friendship film, then Two Towers is an unadulterated war movie of heroic proportions. Peter Jackson said he based it on ""Zulu""- and we can see why. It has a dramatic intensity and flow which none of the other films quite share. Good against evil are so sharply contrasted that you could cut your fingers on them. TTT also has the best score Howard Shore has produced. And it has the best dialogue.",2004
9,"Don`t you just hate cinemas ? No matter where you sit you always end up surrounded by people who spend their time chatting amongst themselves as to the events on screen 30 seconds before they happen . If we`re after a running commentary we`ll buy the DVD thank you very much . Add to this unattended mad mental kids running around wild . In fact many years ago our local newspaper saw a no holds barred letter of complaint about a screening of 3 MEN AND A LITTLE LADY which referred to foul mouthed juvenile delinquents in the audience . And on top of all this I`m a chainsmoker and cinema chains don`t allow patrons to poison themselves or others with nicotine so as a rule I don`t visit cinemas . But it`s a rule I broke in order to see THE TWO TOWERS because I was literally dying to see it . So I booked my ticket well in advance for the premier screening in Rothesay on the 26th of January , popped into the cinema that night and demanded to be entertained",2003
9,"Long before it came out, I knew The Two Towers would be the toughest of the three Lord of the Rings books to put on film. Not only is it the middle child, but the very structure of the book makes it hard to craft a linear story with all the plot lines in tact and interesting.",2004
10,"You'd think you can't improve on a 10/10 movie, but this one does, with great action and characters. There isn't much else to say about the special effects that I didn't already in my first review, they're still fantastic. Peter Jackson doesn't treat this like a sequel, it's just the continuing story of heroes battling the forces of evil.",2007
10,I have to say this film starting with the fellowship was incredibly well made. I know Titanic received 11 awards but I think this whole trilogy should receive 15. This intro to the trilogy was extremely in depth and even had the best prologue ever. I enjoy being introduced to the characters and thier origins and learning about the history of the one ring and how it does evil upon middle earth even after Sauron's death. Be patient with the action as is picks up as the trilogy's story unfolds. It all depends on what you see movies for. But this whole trilogy has quite a bit of everything. That alone surpasses all movies.,2004
8,"Really, The Two Towers is the weakest of the three novels, and it is only natural that the middle volume would be a bit of a let down.  Jackson does a nice job of trying to lift the story - the battle sequence is fantastic - but to my mind the 10 I might have given for this movie went over the cliff with Aragorn.  I have nothing against Jackson deviating from the books - I was not troubled by the changes in the Faramir character, for instance, and adding the Warg riders themselves was a nice touch.  But what was the purpose of sending Aragorn over the cliff?  Creating false tension that probably fooled less than 1% of the audience?  Screen time for Liv Tyler? All it did for me was make the movie feel false for about ten minutes.  This crucial mistake is compunded now that we have the Extended Edition and see some of the scenes that were left out of the theatrical release.  the movie would have been stronger without Aragorn's fall, and with, for instance, the scene between Boromir and Faramir, or the march of the trees to the Battle of Helms Deep.",2004
10,"For this movie, Peter Jackson was faced with a challenge: how to make a great stand-alone film when the beginning and ending are in separate movies? He did a magnificent job. Like the first one, this movie starts with a slam-bang battle; however, where the first film had armies, this film has a clash between two titans.",2004
10,"The second part of The Lord of the Rings saga maintains the style, momentum and integrity that made the first film as brilliant as it is and thus what Peter Jackson gives us is one of the best sequels ever and certainly the best film of 2002. I prefer the first film for being closer to the book but I completely understand the changes made from book to film and I see why they are necessary to keep the film's narrative flowing instead of dropping dead. The film is not without a few weaknesses mainly because of it being a middle part linking The Fellowship of the Ring and The Return of the King and therefore not having an obvious beginning or an end. This doesn't stop the film from being an experience that people shouldn't be cheated out of.",2006
8,"So the journey continues with 'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.' This review will assume you have seen the first film, 'The Fellowship of the Ring.' Which is fine because Peter Jackson, at the helm of this massive production, assumes you have seen it as well. Intelligently, Jackson does not begin with a redundant and unnecessary prologue. He dives right into what the filmmakers considered the hardest of the trilogy to make.",2005
10,"I have been watching Monk ever since the beginning 8 seasons ago. I have been a major fan. I have been holding this review until the very last episode had aired. Well, it has, and this is what I have to say.",2009
9,"Monk is a very entertaining detective series, that is excellent if you want some chuckles for 45 minutes. Tony Shalhoub is fantastic in the lead, giving the character a sense of charm and humour. Monk suffers from OCD. However, because of this, Monk's actions are priceless, as he is obsessed with everything. There was even one episode, when he was at a school, and he wrote his name very neatly on the blackboard, and rubbed it off again, after he was unsatisfied with how it looked. Bitty Schram is lovely as Sharona, and Traylor Howard was a very worthy replacement in the later series as Natalie. Ted Levine is amusing as Stottlemeyer,(I loved the episode with the chimpanzee and Levine jumping up and down in the interview room) there was one episode, when he was exasperated when Monk was convinced that a man who is ""conveniently"" in a coma sent bombs to two people, Levine's reactions were priceless. Jason Gray-Stanford has his moments as Lieutenant Randall Disher. There have also been some great guest stars, one of my many favourites was Tim Curry as Dale ""the Whale"" Biederbeck in the episode Mr Monk Goes To Jail, as well as John Tuturro as Monk's estranged brother Ambrose. I am not hugely keen on Randy Newman, so I don't know what to think of the title song. Other than that, I really like Monk. 9/10 Bethany Cox.",2009
9,"Adrian Monk.....the real O.C.D. I was introduced to Monk several years ago. On New Year's Day, USA Network always hosts a Monk marathon. The first episode I saw was ""Mr.Monk and the Blackout."" After seeing that episode, I've been in love with the show. I know that this rating system is based on people's opinions, and I respect that, but I believe that it deserves a higher average rating than an 8.2.",2008
8,"As MONK winds down, I must admit I did not think the show would run as long as it did. I was obviously wrong. The series, about a mentally defective detective, has had its ups and downs, but Tony Shalhoub always managed to keep things moving along as the quirky investigator. The episodes in this final season have been wildly uneven, but it is interesting to note that Monk seems no longer in constant need of hand wipes. That's akin to Mel Gibson's character in the LETHAL WEPON series eventually giving up smoking. And Monk's adorable aide Natalie has been more playful and affectionate with Monk, making me hope they will stay together as this series rides off into the sunset. The only other show with this kind of pull is HOUSE. And LAW & ORDER, of course. MONK will have a long life in reruns.",2009
9,Intelligence...is everything.,2008
7,"A lot of TV Shows have become popular with the main character having disability. Look at the old-fashioned Ironside, wheelchair-bound. The new Psych, with Shaun Spencer a fraudulent Psychic . Just two examples of this genre. A third is the extremely popular Monk. A Police Officer, who had a nervous breakdown after his wives murder, is also a sufferer of OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder), which helps him solve his cases, as he obsess over every element and goes over every crime scene excessively. He notices unimportant details because of it and uses that to solve his case. The show does have an element of believability in that it would be more believable that someone obsessed about everything would solve difficult crimes, not an average joe. Humour is also a main point, as it's very tongue-in-cheek, and it's the character interactions between Monk and his ""co-workers"" that make you interested. A very good show, and worth watching.",2008
10,"Absolutely MARVELOUS! The concept of this show allows the viewers to have a fabulous show that actually ""thinks outside of the box""! There is NEVER a dull moment on this show, all the characters and actors are OUTSTANDINGLY amazing. Tony Shaloub brings life, compassion and understanding to the world of people with ""issues"". Monk is a rare find on TV and am pleased to share my Friday nights watching such an intelligent and funny show. This is not a typical neurotic or compulsive behavior, he takes it the next level but is able to show the person is actually a human also. Randy - is by far one of the FUNNIEST characters next to Monk on this show. I personally would like to see ""Rocker Randy"" again. The Captain is not as ""Gruff"" as he appears, he has heart also. This show is HIGHLY underrated and deserves to be recognized for its creativity, humor and good old fashion fun!!!!",2006

10,"Monk, Tony Shaloub (?) has always been a favorite with me, since 'Wings'- he also played an absurd character on that show-- although admittedly not this crazy. I have to say I like Natalie much better than Sharona who annoyed me immensely. He plays an extremely mentally unhinged man-- with with many phobias that are pretty absurd. ",2007

10,"Recently was given season one of Monk to watch on DVD while I was on holiday and loved every minute of it. Watched the complete season in one day, found I was unable to stop watching it! Then had to search the net for more. Thankfully I was able to find seasons one & two on an auction site. Have since managed to find seasons three and four. Loved seasons two - four just as much as season one. I have to admit I was a bit worried when I saw that Monk's first assistant Sharona was being replaced half way through season three, but found that by the end of the episode that Natalie was introduced I really like her character. She seems to be a bit more patient and understanding with Monk than Sharona was. Some times Sharona seemed to get rather short with him. Have just ordered season five from the States as it has not come out here in New Zealand yet and don't think it will be long before I do the same with season six. My thanks to everyone who helps to provide such entertaining viewing. Long may it continue!!!!",2008

Both are USA TV shows, yet where I live in NZ, Psych is on Prime time while Monk has the ignominy of being in the afternoon on a weekend. What i like about this show is that the forensics are kept to the minimum or that they are stumped. I really can't stand the unrealistic sci-fi of CSI or its other clones.",2008
10,Scooby-Doo is a worthy live action film to a brilliant original T.V. show,2007
9,"I watched Scooby Doo, the cartoon, only with medium level interest as a child, so I went (with my wife and kids) mostly as a kick.  Matthew Lillard is brilliant as Shaggy (how is that possible?  His impersonation skills were flawless!).  The cartoonimation of Scooby and Scrappy Doo were interesting but were so 3-D rendered that they did not match the original 2-D versions very well.  The plot was reasonably interesting and twisted.  No mere disgruntled janitor in a spooky disguise-- there's some evil genius at work. There were some minor plot issues with Velma, Fred, and Daphne having much greater insecurity issues than in the cartoons, but experimenting with such ideas is very cartoon-like.  The set and cast worked very well.  There's some biological humor with Shaggy and Scooby that I did not expect, but the last bit that they did helped.  If you're prudish about gas-passing and belching, there are about 4 minutes you can do without, but they seem very much in character.",2002
10,"I've always been a big fan of horror films and when I was too young to watch them, SCOOBY was my favourite cartoon because it had cool heroes and I could see all sorts of monsters in it. Even now that I'm an adult, I still find a lot of pleasure in watching an episode. Just to say that I wasn't very excited at the perspective of seeing my cult cartoon turned into an unnamable stuff as the first pictures in the magazines announced a visually ridiculous movie with probably (like most of the other TV series adaptations) a boring and incoherent script.",2002
6,"This movie works because it tries to mimic the cartoon in many ways. Even the first shot looks like the first shot of the cartoon with the fog and the creepy old house. I had originally thought that the CGI Scooby would bother me during the movie, but I was completely wrong. I only really thought about that the first time Scooby is shown. After that the dog was Scooby to me because the things he says and the way he says them are accurate to the cartoon. The movie is pure cheese, but so was the cartoon. ""Scooby-Doo"" has maybe the most effective farting scene since ""Blazing Saddles."" Most fart scenes just come off as gross and not very funny, but in the world of Scooby a fart scene works. One interesting aspect of the film was seeing Rowan Atkinson in a role where he actually talks...a lot! I hope he gets more chances at dialogue-heavy roles here in the States.  Fred, Daphne, Velma and Shaggy all feel like their cartoon counterparts adding to the effectiveness of the movie. Lillard is amazing as Shaggy because he gets his voice to sound like a carbon-copy of the cartoon Shaggy. This is a fun movie to watch because you can turn your brain off and just enjoy the show.",2002
8,"I really think that this movie was pretty good.  Some parts in the movie were really funny.  This casting was also good, the actors played the characters pretty well.  I also think it was funny because in cases they made fun of the cartoon.  Although, I didn't really like the villians.  I could think of some better villians for the movie, but it just made it more interesting in the end.  Over all - my rating: 8.",2002

I've anxiously been awaiting this film since Mike Myers began working on scripts for it years back. I wanna know what the hell happened to his scripts. Although I can't see him as Shaggy (Matt Lillard was perfect in the role), perhaps if they had stuck to Myers' script, the film would have been good instead of the PoS it turned out to be. I promised my sisters' kids I would take them to see it, but after some of the stuff I had heard, I wanted to preview it before taking them (I figured I'd wanna see it again anyway - boy was I wrong!). Turns out it was no worse than the kids' endless viewings of ""Dumb and Dumber"" on TBS, so I had to sit through this piece of crap twice....what a waste of 3 hours of my life.",2002

3,"Huh... This wasn't much a mystery, I must admit. You have no mystery at all, actually. In fact, WTF was the storyline, again? Like you have A huge computer animated monsrtocity in the middle of the screen, and you call it the main character. The jokes weren't even original. They were more like old Shakespeare jokes that the villain would chuckle. Or at least, something from the sixties. Wait... I've laughed at a few things from the sixties. Plus... there's a big thing about real monsters and spirits added in. I actually like the good old idea of taking off the mask to reveal some hick in a costume.

6,"Upon second stoned viewing my endearment is renewed. The marijuana references will fly above the wee ones' little noggins. For the rest of us, it's a quintessential high home entertainment experience. Whereas the vulnerable compromised mind might panic from genuine chills and thrills, the mild scares herein enhanced by intoxication fit just right. The golden twosome, Fred and Daphne are himbo and bimbo incarnate, while Velma predictably suffers from mortal cartoon myopia and a body of knowledge limited only by plot requirements. Stoner stars, Shaggy and Scooby are happily single-minded in their pursuit of munchies, while remaining lovably selfish and craven. Ultimately, the crew rises to the occasion even if it requires slight departure from caricature. With suitable scatologies, Scooby's infectious cackle, and single-minded snack fixation, it's a ""runderful"" romp, not to be enjoyed sober. P.S. Cartoonish CGI complements the mood, so don't have a cow about it, okay?",2005
1,"Forget the HYPE, this movie stinks!  It doesn't know which audience to play for 3 year olds or adults.  It also doesn't know whether it should be campy or cartoonish.  It's a jumbled mess that only did well because of the Very LARGE and VERY EXPENSIVE marketing. If you want something to keep the kids busy, spend the money on a new toy and watch the cartoon! My rating 1...HORRIBLE DESPITE HYPE!",2002

1,"Scooby Doo is the most loved cartoon of all time for most of us.  Warner Brothers absolutely destroyed the reputation of Scooby and the gang.  They have been tainted with the culture of the newest generation.  The movie was full of boring people and completely lacking of any mystery whatsoever. The ending was the worst ending ever, and to top it all off Scooby was designed by rejects with no imagination.  Biggest disappointment ever, this movie belongs on the worst 100 movies of all time.",2002
1,The original Scooby Doo cartoons were silly and predictable but had a certain charm and colour which has endeared them to a generation of kids. A later series added Scrappy who was the most irritating cartoon character before the intentionally irritating Poochie in the Simpsons. Scrappy's contribution to this shocker is him pointlessly urinating on Thelma (obviously no one house trained him) at which point this tiresome character is dropped out of the mystery machine.,2009

5,I agree i think they should kill Roselyn Sanchez off and i also think that martin and Sam should get back together but before that i think she should get back with jack and Martin and Viv should have an affair and i think they should let Enrique pick his own love interest on without a trace and they should bring jacks wife back in.They should a Christmas where they all go away for the holidays together and show people that Christmas is about giving not receiving and being with the people they love and their friend and what it's like when people can't be with the people they love.Sam should choose who she wants and who ever she decides to be with they should get married with a twist.,2006

2,"What is going on at WAT? After tonight's brilliantly directed and lit but awful episode (did any of the producers bother to read the script?) the previews for next week's show introduce Roselyn Sanchez as, presumably, a new regular character.",2008
2,"What a waste! It took the WAT producers a half season until they hit their stride (the pilot was oh-hum but the show showed potential for growth, in particular with its great cast.) The second season was excellent, with better photography and more interesting writing and decent ""persoanl arcs"" for each character.",2006
7,"The show is still very good though my friends and I, who watch it together, agree with another viewer that Ms Sanchez ruined an excellent #10 show. There were already two women and a Spanish-American on board, so the show was politically correct and the ensemble fantastic. I never wished anybody (besides Hitler and heads of the soviet Union) to die, but I heartily wish that Ms Sanches' character would be shot for good and the show would return to its previous magnificence. Well, then I could purchase the following seasons' disks as well as those I had without Ms Sanchez' not enjoyable and unwanted presence. Could there be a possible hope in that direction? What a great thing it would be.",2007
2,Roselyn Sanchez has completely destroyed the interest I used to have in this show.,2007
10,"I am sorry that ""Without A Trace"" went off the air after five years, though I agree with other reviewers that it had probably exhausted its possibilities. The show had many things going for it: a first-rate cast, a set of often surprising plot twists, and an ability to look at some of the darkest parts of New York city life. Anthony LaPaglia, as the head of the FBI missing- persons unit, gave a set of performances that were truly gripping: his character was always tough, devoted, and often very reserved, but there was always an enormous amount of passion locked within him which would come out at the most desperate moments. The rest of the cast were uniformly good, and I agree with many other observers that Marianne Jean-Baptiste was a superb actress and a perfect colleague for LaPaglia's plain-spoken FBI man.",2012
1,The woman is a menace to acting.,2007
1,"I've come to hate this show--the agents are so over the top and the events are so badly done that to say it stretches reality is greatly beyond an understatement. Malone is off-kilter so much he should be in jail for all the stuff he pulls. The personal drama between the characters detract too much from what's going on. The agents consistently abuse, threaten, and brow-beat suspects, witnesses, and victims that that whole unit should be looking for new jobs...or suspension at the least. I've stopped watching this show...no originals, no reruns, no more TiVo season pass.",2008
3,"This series started off with promise but has quickly faded to the back of the pack. The show is light on character development, which can be alright (see ""Law & Order"" with Benjamin Bratt and Jerry Orbach). However, the plots are hackneyed and played out in overly dramatic fashion, which doesn't work for a show that should be grittier and uglier. Also, I don't mind figuring out the mystery a few minutes early, it happens from time to time with all shows, but figuring it out 15 minutes early and then having to suffer through melodramatic moments and elaborate epiphanies accompanied by music that sounds as though it came from a ""Soundtracks 101a"" class is just gut-wrenching. My recommendation? Skip this copycat and stick with the winners: L&O (original), CSI (original), and The Shield. If you want a show closer to Without a Trace but with a bit more body, try ""Criminal Minds.""",2006
9,After reading a half-dozen of the reviews convinced that a lot of folks who didn't like it were expecting a typical cop show. It isn't. May have been an experiment on Bruckheimer's part - turning cop show conventions on their head.,2014
6,"As much as I admire Aussie actor Anthony LaPaglia, WAT is generally a very dull show, about people gone missing. LaPaglia is the head of an FBI unit specializing in finding missing persons. Unfortunately, he sleepwalks through most episodes. And his team, with the exception of Marianne Baptiste, is made up of typical B-level TV actors, all very generic and interchangeable. LaPaglia's character initially was introduced on one of the CSI shows. I can recommend watching WAT for one reason and one reason only: If there is no LAW & ORDER or LAW & ORDER SVU episode playing. Then it is better than nothing. It's like COLD CASE or CROSSING JORDAN: They are good enough to watch while waiting for LAW & ORDER. And I will say WAT is a cut above any of the CSI shows.",2008
7,For three seasons this show about missing persons was a favorite of mine. Then the show itself went missing (it changed nights) and I never saw it again.,2010
5,"Now I liked Without a Trace when it first started. It wasn't brilliant, but somehow it kept my attention. But later around the time Rosalyn Sanchez came on the scene, while not as badly as Special Victim's Unit did, it jumped the shark a bit. Without A Trace is slick, with nice photography and interesting locations, while the music is great. The best asset though for me is Anthony LaPaglia, who is excellent as Jack. That said, Without a Trace does have its problems. The story ideas are interesting and are decently written in general, but there is a lot of ponderous pacing in this show. I appreciate it is for character development and atmosphere but there is almost every episode with one scene with nothing happening other than haunting music and reflective facial expressions it does get a bit too much. The show's writing is not exceptional either, not awful granted but it can get uninteresting and repetitive on occasions. I also have to concur about Rosalyn Sanchez, I personally don't think she adds anything to the show, and her character does come across as rather cold and difficult to empathise with. Overall, it was decent, but it is a show of pluses and minuses. 5/10 Bethany Cox",2010
9,"Perhaps I'm a little biased. After all, this is set in the city I live and work in, and seeing Oxford Street and Piccadilly Circus, which I pass by every morning and which are usually teeming with crowds of people, completely empty was enough to send shivers down my spine. Usually when you watch a movie like this it's located in some nondescript Midwestern village, which makes it easy to detach yourself from the events unfolding on screen. But seeing them occur in the place you call home is something that gives it an entirely new sense of reality, and one I was previously unaccustomed to.",2003

10,"The key to keeping the sci-fi horror genre alive in the cinemas, as of late, is to make sure the material and techniques the filmmakers present is at least competent, at it's average creative, and at it's best something that we haven't seen before or haven't seen in such a style or form. George A. Romero did that back in prime 60s and 70s era of film-making, bringing forth one of the most memorable trilogies of all time for the genre. While many consider Romero to be on any given list one of the greatest horror directors (I included), it is important to know that he too had his sources for his little independent film in 1968, and after that was when he really got inventive, resulting in a masterpiece and a lackluster. Director Danny Boyle and author Alex Garland know that if they were to cook up a yarn all too similar to Romero it wouldn't be satisfying. So, they've done what is essential to the success of 28 Days Later- they take ideas that have been in practice for many years, turn them fresh, and as the audience we feel repelled, excited, terrified, nauseous (perhaps), and enthralled, but we won't leave feeling like we've seen complete hack work. ",2003
8,"The 2003 State-side release of Danny Boyle's ""28 Days Later"" was advertised as being a shockful scare-fest of a movie. I didn't get around to seeing it until a few days ago and I gotta feel like that was somewhat of an embellishment on the promoters' part.",2005
7,"Long before I watched 28 DAYS LATER I had an online conversation with a couple of my cyber friends Jeremy and Riquez . Jeremy praised the movie thinking it was one of the best film releases in several years . I did point out to him the ridiculous idea that a virus with an incubation period of 20 seconds wouldn't be able to cause the type of havoc as featured in the movie . Riquez contributed to the conversation by saying "" Theo you have no problem with rabid zombies but you find a virus with an incubation period of 20 seconds ridiculous ! "" After finally seeing 28 DAYS LATER ( Thanks for the video Robin ) my reservations were confirmed , the audience can quite happily accept the concept of raging psychos tearing up the country destroying all in their path but the thought put into small details spoils the film somewhat ",2004
8,"As it so happens, 28 Days Later is the best zombie movie in the last few decades. Probably since Romero's classics, if I recall accurately. It stands up on its own in a genre which is frequently plagued by a sort of innate stupidity, a consequence of one too many dead people. Otherwise how could one explain the fact that the most acclaimed zombie films are parodies of the genre? ",2003
9,"A film that at time plays like a frenzied docudrama, 28 DAYS LATER... is unrelenting, grim, horrific, and completely nightmarish. Images of violence against humans dominates the screen for a few minutes, and we soon learn these are televisions mounted against a wall, broadcasting non-stop footage of the inhuman things people do to one another. A monkey lies strapped down, facing these images, helpless. There are others in cages nearby. A band of environmentalists break in, predictably to free these imprisoned monkeys, but a conflict ensues as a scientist barges in and warns them it would be completely insane to do so -- they're infected with Rage. However, since scientists normally equal evil corporations and dehumanized technology known for cruelty not only against animals but humans, they proceed to free one of the apes... and total pandemonium breaks loose as the monkey viciously attacks its freer, and in seconds we see her eyes have become red. She is an infected.",2005
9,"28 Days Later successfully takes the zombie genre to a new level, this movie is far more than just a horror flick. There are some great characters, that you actually care about, some you'll like, some you'll be glad to see killed, but all solidly performed.",2006
8,"Danny Boyle is an exceptionally gifted filmmaker and I've been enamored with his work since the brilliant ""Shallow Grave."" ""Trainspotting"" only gets better every time you see it and ""A Life Less Ordinary"" has some bright moments. (The singing and dancing number is parfait.) Mr. Boyle hit a bump in the road when it came to ""The Beach,"" but then he forsake us all by casting DiCaprio. He's back to redeem himself, as is Alex Garland, with ""28 Days Later,"" a marvelous twist on the apocalyptic film.",2003
8,"This film was fantastic. I was expecting something along the lines of a combination of ""Resident Evil"" and ""The Day After Tomorrow"" but this is quite different from that description. Yes, it involves a terrible disease that leaves its infected victims as blood-sucking, mindless zombies who pray on the not-yet-infected and yes, it involves a group of survivors who are left together to fend for themselves. But it is quite different from Resident Evil (no comic-book or video-game type plot here and no explosives or automatic weapons) and is a much more thrilling ""survivalist-type"" film than ""The Day After Tomorrow"".",2005
3,"This movie is mildly entertaining but there are a ridiculous amount of loop holes. In fact, there are so many that it becomes distracting while viewing the film. This is quite disappointing because the idea of the film has so much more potential, although it is an idea that has remarkable similarities to about 20 other zombie type flicks. First i'll start off with what i liked, then i will continue with a list of loopholes and other points that ruin this movie.",2005

By this standard, 28 DAYS LATER. plummets to bottom of the bad movie barrel.  Rarely have  film characters made such consistently, stupefying decisions.  Skip this flick unless you're meeting with friends, have a couple of beers, and want an impromptu session of  Mystery Science Theater 3000.",2003
5,"Back in good old Great Britain, Danny Boyle proves that he's still a gifted filmmaker even though his short Hollywood career wasn't as fruitful as initially hoped for. The opening sequences of this ""28 Days Later"" are downright astonishing and  for a moment  you suspect that you're about to watch to most brilliant horror film in a long, long time. Especially the already classic sequence in which Jim (Cillian Murphy) wanders through the entirely deserted streets of the otherwise so lively and crowded London, guided by disturbing music, is efficiently creepy. The plot centers on an extremely aggressive virus that turns people into blood-crazed maniacs. It's only 28 days since the virus was unleashed and the entire population is wiped away already, while a few lonely survivors desperately prepare for the total apocalypse. Jim is one of them, as he just awoke from a coma, completely unaware of the vile events that took place the past 28 days Even though the story isn't very original (Romero's ""The Crazies"" come to mind as well as ""Last Man on Earth"" and ""The Omega Man""), Danny Boyle succeeds in portraying a gripping mix of drama, action, suspense and  oh yes  gore! Now, I really wished I could end my user comment here and conclude that ""28 Days Later"" was a simply great new horror film but unfortunately the script takes a complete U-turn halfway and becomes a repetitive lesson in which Boyle and writer Alex Garland try to convince us that mankind still remains the biggest threat of all. The last survivors end up at a military post where their lives are even in bigger danger. The tension and carefully built up atmosphere disappears and is replaced by tedious macho speeches and gratuitous brutality. The acting performances in this film aren't very spectacular but that's understandable considering most cast-members are debuting here. The fact that this project was entirely filmed with digital cameras might be a nice trivia element, but I'm not too keen on this type of cinematography. Overall, Boyle's film is worthy viewing for horror fans but experienced fanatics won't be too impressed.",2005
7,"This, I have to say, was one of the better viral-zombie films I have seen. The plot was highly un-original, but extremely well made. The acting was powerfully preformed, the filming having many ""diagonally tilted camera view"" scenes, giving off more suspense, without the reliance on the overly used ""scary music"". Also, the addition of the alternate ending gave a strong closing to the film. This is the kind of movie that you end up feeling physically drained after seeing your first time. It will suck you in until the end, every time. I seriously recommend seeing this if you enjoy zombie films, you will not be disappointed.",2005

Impressed with the start and it reminded me of a 70/80's series i think called survivor....The London scenes worked well and i for a time thought i might be in for a chiller about what you would do if a handful of people were left.... The music gave the clue that all was not well and what was promising fell apart when they contacted the Army north of Manchester...In the face of attacks by the infected would an army unit act in such a way...i don't think they would...add an unresolved ending and it was a mess. As a zombie movie fine..but after such a good start a waste of a subject that hasn't been taken to a conclusion of what you would do if you were left alone...that would be more spooky.",2004
4,"Well, OK it was not bad (Resident Evil was a far worse zombie-movie) but this movie just made little sense!",2013
1,"Now, I love Zombie movies - Romero, Raimi, even Shaun of the Dead are classics. But this ... this is just boring. (And in response to a previous reviewer who implied that those who didn't like this are too thick for 2001 and Memento - I both loved and understood those movies). There is no sense of impending terror, apart from one all-too-brief sequence in a tunnel (although you have to wonder why they were stupid enough to go in there). The characters are very one-dimensional, and the female lead goes from being a machete-wielding tough girl to a screaming, cringing little girl waiting for the big brave man to rescue her (Apparently falling in love makes men murderous and women weak). The much vaunted opening sequence of an empty London has been done before, and better, in Day of the Triffids. There were a couple of 'make-you-jump' moments - but not many. The final battle sequence is so disjointed and awkward it's difficult to know what's going on.",2008
9,"Firstly when you try to watch with a constantly controversial community with the film, if you evaluate this 28-day adventure with blank glances like the British excavation that has eaten the virus since the minute of the end, you will see that the movie is directly virus-infected. In other words, the movie is infected, it's processed from beginning to end. It is a film that can be described as a classic among the infected movies. The fact that it is not possible to leave the island in the film, what is attributed to the fictional, may be considered a reference to both empty London streets and perhaps Hollywood cinema, the UK is the center of the world. It is possible to search for mistakes in the film, to sort out the parties who are not suitable for the real life. However, in my opinion, a film that features more fictional items alongside these real icons, should not be considered too much. All kinds of material used as classical zombie movie stereotypes virus, red eyes, rapid change, aggression and protection, this is a metaphor. If Boyle is trying to get the viewer into the film, he has done it a lot, I do not think that Boyle try to overlap and confront the reality in a movie with such fantastic content. The film begins with a classical zombie movie and then shows the war that people turn into psychological tension and what they can do to survive and what they can do. The soundtracks in the movie are tremendous. Nowadays these soundtracks are still available in many places. The film has great views because it is captured with a digital camera. This visuality is even better, especially since the shoots are usually in the morning. Through Danny Boyle, this film has been interpreted differently by many people. Because you can get many questions in the movie. These questions are almost always an answer, but audience comments can be joined very clearly. Because there is not always a definite answer in the film. So it makes a good movie to think about the events to the audience. In the film you feel the difference of using a basic camera very clearly. Even though it is fantastic in terms of content, this basic camera makes the film very realistic. In summary, despite the fact that the film is fantasy-based, the basic camera shots can give you a fear. Only in the last scene was a movie camera. It allows you to feel as though you were in that adventure, as if you had taken an event that you experienced.",2017
9,"Although the plot is very unoriginal, I especially liked this version of the story because of the leisurely pace that sets the mood without letting you get bored. The Director didn't mind relatively long sequences without dialog when it was called for; I'm not sure a Hollywood-made film (this one was made in the U.K. by a U.K. company) would have been willing to do this. Ever since Star Wars the reigning action-movie concept in Hollywood seems to be action every 7 minutes max.",2005

When they are in the same room you feel that there is something there, they both feel it too.

Thank the spirits that flow someone still has the ability, honesty, and energy to make such a film in the land of fakery and deception.

The incredible chemistry between an amazing Maggie Gyllenhaal and a repressed yet fierce James Spader is what makes this movie work so well, and the tender depths to which their relationship is portrayed makes it so much more than just a film about sadomasochism. I felt that the main theme of the film was to show that people have pain, and it is only when you accept that pain that you are able to feel your emotions fully, therefore making your life much more livable. This movie was a bit quirky, and might not be for everyone. However, I would recommend it to anyone with an open mind. ""Secretary"" is by far my favorite film of the year.",2002

The details is that Edward is sadistic and a very dominating man, who humiliates Lee most of the time. Of course they will fall in love for each other, after many funny situations. This low budget movie is a wonderful unconventional romantic comedy, one of the weirdest I have ever seen, supported by excellent lead actor and actress and an original screenplay. The always-excellent James Spader is one of my favorite actors, and Maggie Gyllenhaal gives also an extraordinary performance in this film. The situations that Lee uses to tease Edward are hilarious.

7,"In this romantic black comedy, Maggie Gyllenhaal stars as Lee Holloway, the lady worker of the title. As you probably already know, this secretary doesn't just push pens and use paper clips, she has another, more exciting capacity as her boss's love object. The film actually isn't quite as naughty as many people think it thinks it is, but the truth is that the sadomasochistic area of the film isn't really all that important. The film isn't really about obscure sexual preferences, it's about finding someone whom you are comfortable with and the S&M is just a means to an end. The sex aspect of the film does serve a purpose, however, in that it's that which makes the film a social satire of this culture of flirting in the office; a very over the top one, that is, and one that gives the film it's shock value; but to be honest, you don't really get to see that much bondage. The film is very original in it's portrayal of S&M however, as it's a very taboo subject and for it to be portrayed in a sweet and upbeat manner like this is welcome and very different.",2004

Secratary enlightens us on the true meaning of love. As unconventional as their relationship was (in our society's view on love and relationships), it was true love and it was more beautiful then any other love story I have seen or read.

With a minimum of dialogue, both Gyllenhaal and James Spader (who plays her boss) are able to convey volumes. I walked out of the theater feeling both exhilarated and optimistic. Expect great things from Maggie Gyllenhaal in the future, and thanks to the director for coaxing such a multidimensional and compelling heartbreaking performance from James Spader. I hope you like it...",2002
8,"*Spoilers Alert!* Hot, Hot, HOT! So hot I watched it three times this past weekend. OK, that said this movie does deal with some complex adult subject matter that I myself have been trying to learn more about lately, specifically the BDSM/D&S world. The performances in the movie are excellent, Spader and Gyllenhaal had some pretty obvious chemistry going on in each scene. The sexual tension is drawn very tautly throughout the film and never yields even a millimeter.",2005
10,"Man, I can not get this film out of my head. It is so rare that a movie can affect me the way ""The Pianst"" did. The last movie that did that was ""Casino"". I was really tired when I was watching the movie. It was almost midnight, so I was thinking that I'll start watching and I'll finish it in the morning. Did I? No, indeed I did not stop watching. I couldn't stop it. I just wanted to see what would happen next. I cried during ""Schindler's List"", I sobbed in this film. Everything that happens in this film is so sad. Adrien Brody does a remarkable job of acting in this film. I would very highly recommend this film. Especially if you are a history buff. Please, I think this film should be in the top 10 best films of all time.",2004
8,"The Pianist is the true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, at the time Poland's most acclaimed pianist whose life is transformed during the Nazi occupation of Warsaw beginning in 1939.  The film spans several years and maps his many personal trials in addition to providing the perspectives of his family, rebel factions and sympathizers.",2003
10,"The Pianist is an account of the true life experience of a Polish pianist during WW2, in the context of the deportation of the Jewish community to the Ghetto of Warsaw, a setting virtually absent from all films inspired on WW2.",2003
10,"'The Pianist' is definitively an inspiring epic that celebrates the tenacity and fortitude of the human spirit... It is a remarkable tale of human survival sensitively brought to life by Polanski... The film carries us to the horrible reign of terror, where condemned people wearing the emblem of humiliation and oppression, are deprived of their rights, their human values and dignity, before being shipped to 'labor camps.' ",2005
10,"This wrenching yet ultimately uplifting fact-based drama won Adrien Brody his Academy Award and finally made him a star (along with his gracious yet heartfelt Oscar speech and That Kiss :-) -- rightly so, since title character Wladyslaw Szpilman is a challenging role in so many ways!  It's not easy to command the screen when your character often has to be passive, deliberately trying not to draw attention to himself to keep from falling into Nazi hands in war-torn Poland, but Brody pulls it off.  It helps that Brody is absolutely stellar at acting with his eyes, plus his body language speaks volumes; these fill in the emotional cracks, especially in scenes where Szpilman, alone and in hiding, can't speak or even move around much for fear of giving himself away.  (Brody is the youngest actor to date to win the Best Actor Oscar, BTW, having gotten his little gold man only a month before his 30th birthday.) While there's no lack of haunting scenes, thanks to the deservedly Oscar-winning work of director Roman Polanski and screenwriter Ronald Harwood, the one that always gets me is the one where Szpilman discovers the apartment serving as his latest `safe house' has a piano. We see Szpilman sit at the piano; we see him in a head-and-shoulders shot, shoulders moving; we hear piano music and gasp as we fear his love and longing for music is about to give him away -- and then we see his hands moving in the air just above the keyboard and realize, with both relief and a pang of regret, that the music is only in Szpilman's head.  Terrific as the other 2002 Best Actor nominees were, now that I've seen THE PIANIST (as well as the fascinating making-of documentary on the DVD's flip side, showing what a physically and emotionally grueling experience Brody's job often was), I'd be really p***ed off if anybody but Adrien Brody had won! (Besides, the rest of the 2002 Best Actor nominees already won Oscars -- this time it was dark horse Brody's turn! :-)",2004
10,"The Pianist is an incredible film in many aspects. Roman Polanski's account of the survival of the pianist, Wladyslaw Szpilman, is a document about how one man can overcome the worst possible situations in a world gone completely mad around him.",2003
9,"Polanski has depicted the gory details of the holocaust without much restraint. But, the most wonderful aspect of the film is that the director has not lost focus of his story and instead of focusing too much on the holocaust horror he has weaved the true-life narrative of survival around devillish happenings.",2003
9,"I remember seeing ""Schindler's list"" about ten years ago, and I remember how weird I felt for being almost completely unmoved by it. Although it showed the horrors of holocaust quite realistically, somehow it all seemed just a bit too fake and exaggerated. Characters were a bit off (I still can't decide who was more over the top, Schindler or Goeth), fake sentimentalism was all over the place, . While it was a work of art and an important reminder of true events that shouldn't be forgotten, on emotional level it just somehow failed to deliver.",2005
10,"The Pianist tells the story of such a man in war time Poland, played by Adrien Brody, who from start to finish sees his life literally getting worse and worse and worse- starts off with new rules from the Nazis, then the stars on the arms, followed by the Warsaw ghetto, and while there he could play in the restaurant, that too soon ended, as the trains arrived and took his family and anyone else he knew away.  During this he narrowly escapes, and from then on the film in a sense almost becomes not exactly a holocaust film, but more like a cross of that as the element and the basic structure of something a-la in Cast Away: this includes stretches of scenes showing Brody simply trying to keep out of view of the Germans, either in a small apartment provided by helpful Polish Christians/Jewish resistance, or as a scavenger in the abandoned sections of the ghetto, all while feeling the old rhythm of the piano in his head and fingertips.  ",2003
10,"last weekend, I saw Roman Polanski's The Pianist and what a movie. The grizzly reality feeling of the movie shell-shocked me in the first place but later on I recognized the pure feeling of the film: The horror what war does with innocent people truly is. the main story isn't about a war hero, but about people who don't want to die in this madness. Every aspect of the film is really done for an reason and in his place and you don't feel this as entertainment.",2002
8,"Film makers have to step carefully when dealing with issues like the Nazi extermination program. There have been equally brutal programs of ethnic cleansing in places like Southeast Asia and Rwanda, in which hundreds of millions died, but nothing like this in Europe since the Middle Ages. The victims here were not only Jews but Gypsies, the mentally ill, homosexuals, socialists, communists, and political undesirables. The Nazis eliminated not six million but some uncountable number between 12 and 15 million. An event like that can't be treated lightly and milked for easy tears, or the event itself is cheapened.",2008
10,"Fortunately, I'm able to keep my personal feelings about Roman Polanski compartmentalized enough to say that this was a remarkable film. I've read many comparisons between ""The Pianist"" and ""Schindler's List"" on this board, and even though the films are quite different, the overpowering portrayals of Man's inhumanity against Man will leave the viewer forever affected. Adrien Brody's Best Actor award was stunningly achieved here, as his character arcs through an incredible series of circumstances to barely survive life in the Warsaw Ghetto during World War II. What little I knew of director Polanski outside of his marriage to Sharon Tate, the grisly Manson murders, and his rape conviction in the late 1970's, was put into an entirely different perspective when I learned about his own life in the Polish Ghetto. Much of what we see in the film must emanate from his own unique experience as a child during the War and experiencing Nazi atrocity first hand. I don't envy anyone who survived that experience enduring the painful daily memories of those times.",2013
10,"I believe this movie to be one of the most excellent movies of our times. It has several aspects that make it especially great. Firstly, the music, the most important feature of this movie, in my opinion. Chopin nocturnes and polonaises are perfectly chosen and arrayed to create an unforgettable atmosphere. In one scene, they even take time to play the whole piece of music, without interfering. Secondly, the actors in the movie: none of them are/were really well known, but WOW! (for lack of a better word). Thirdly, it's one of the few movies, where you can actually watch the credits (forever) and wish the movie wouldn't end.",2012
10,"To think that I avoided ""The Pianist"" for about 10 years because I expected a new ""Schindler's List""! And I don't even mean that negatively.",2012
10,My husband and I decided to watch this on netflix one night as we had heard it was good. Neither of us had any expectations and figured if it won a couple of Oscars it must be decent. I had no idea it was an absolute masterpiece. ,2011
10,"The Pianist is not a movie made for entertainment. It's either more or less than that and only the viewer can decide. You have to ask yourself sometimes if the main reason films about the holocaust are so popular is because of shock appeal. If a movie depicts these terrifying events well, does that make it a good movie? The Pianist has many scenes showing the Nazi's brutality that feel almost voyeuristic. Some scenes show Adrien Brody's character looking out the window at these terrible things and you feel as if you're looking out a window, too.",2003
1,So this film has won the Palme D'Or? I didn't see any reason why...,2003
1,"If you think that movies that deal with Nazi atrocities are inherently worthwhile, then you might think that this movie is inherently worthwhile. If, on the other hand, you expect a movie, whether it deals with Nazi atrocities or not, to actually tell a story, then I'd say there's a good chance you *won't* find this movie worthwhile.  ",2003

2,"There is only one rule when making a successful sequel. That is, that the sequel has has to be head and shoulders above its predecessor to be considered good at all. It has to be fresh. The key to making a good comedy is to make the humor seem effortless enough so that the audience can enjoy it without having to be told what is funny (this is why laugh-tracks on sitcoms are the worst idea ever). The key to creating a good plot is to give it time to develop, and to let the audience enjoy its twists and turns, whether they be good or bad.",2002
6,"Let me just start by saying that I normally like movies with Tommy Lee Jones and / or Will Smith in them. They certainly don't belong to the enormous group of average and unnoticeable actors, but have some kind of style and presence that I really can appreciate. But I'm afraid that's about the best thing I can say about them right now, because what they did in this movie was nothing but a hasty 'grab-as-much-money-as-you-can' job and I really don't like to see that.",2005
3,"As funny as the original MIB was, the sequel proves that the same old thing can get very old and very tired very quickly. I mean, how often can you really find it funny to watch an alien grow its head back after having it shot off? This was a cute gag in the original (and I think we only saw it happen once if I remember correctly.) In this one, it happens over and over again. HEY! AFTER THE FIRST TIME IT'S NOT THAT FUNNY! That's the basic problem with this movie. It doesn't seem to have a lot to differentiate it from the first one, with the result that it's just not that interesting.",2003
7,"My Take: Not as wildly enjoyable as the first, but makes a terrific sequel. ",2008
5,"Sequels are almost inherently inferior to their original films. The reason that a sequel is ever made is because the original film was a huge success and therefore people want to see more, but at the same time have developed high expectations from the original film, expectations which are rarely if ever completely fulfilled. In my opinion, every sequel has a right not to live up to the original that it followed, but Men In Black II abuses the privilege almost as much as Austin Powers has already done twice so far. Roger Ebert makes an interesting comment in his review of Men In Black II, stating that the original was so enormously successful because it was unexpected and we had not seen anything like it, while the second one is a rehash of the original, and now we HAVE seen something like it. The expected result is that, like the two Austin Powers sequels, what we have here is little more than an extension of the same jokes that we saw in the original film.",2002
8,"''Men in Black II'' is not fantastic as the first movie, but it is a good and entertaining movie to be watched anyway.",2006
6,"This movie is the sequel of course to the hit movie ""Men In Black"".  I gave this movie a six, but I felt like being generous (I probably should give it a five).  This movie is short.  I mean really, really short.  There is a short that preceded the movie so that tells you how short this movie is (the short got more laughs than the movie I think).  I went to this movie knowing how short it was, but it just went by so fast and the movie was a bit unmemorable that it was a waste of time to drive to the theater.  There was no time for character development or much story development.  In fact, the opening credit scene itself took four or five minutes.  The story has Smith's character trying to get the memory back of Jones character to battle an alien threat.  For the most part there isn't much that is funny in this one, but there are a few scenes to make a person chuckle.  Then there is the pug dog.  I think it had the same screen time as Tommy Lee Jones.  It was funny in small doses, but its role was expanded way too much for the sequel. Johnny Knoxville's character was lame as was the main villain, which had looks but no funny dialogue at all.  Tony Shaloub is back, and once again his character's role is small and underused.  So all in all this is an inferior sequel by all means with just enough to look at to keep you from getting bored.  If they ever make a part three, please let them get a director who is capable of making a movie.",2003
1,For such a belated (and now unwanted) sequel to feel so much like a quick-rehash to cash in on the original's success is weird. This movie had 5 years (and some false-starts) to refine and for the filmmakers to really make it something special for the fans and to pay tribute to the brilliant Men in Black. It never happened.,2004
10,"On one of the coolest looking sequels ever, Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones find themselves back in action as secret agents J and K, protecting the Earth from the scum of the Universe. Just like part 1, the theme song (""Black Suits Coming"") makes you move your feet, the effects are top notch (the miniature galaxy inside the locker, the subway-eating worm, the post office workers etc.), and the general feel just make you smile. Sure, its nothing too deep or too inventive as the first one  but it's a solid, entertaining sequel with magnificent eye-candy nonetheless and a hell of a time at theaters (first) and on DVD (later). ""Let me see you nod your heads (black suits coming)""",2007

I thought the first one was average (5/10), but this one gets a (1/10).  I didn't laugh once the whole time, and the story was terrible. This is one of the worst ten movies i have ever seen.",2002
1,"While not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, the original ""Men in Black"" was a lighthearted, entertaining vehicle smoothly carried by the repartee between Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones.  This debacle, however, bears little resemblance to the 1997 crowdpleaser.",2002
6,"Men in Black II contains lots of humour and competently executed visuals, however the story falls short of the original Men in Black. But it's always enjoyable to visit an old friend, even if they aren't on top form.",2002
10,"I was really impressed by the first MIB movie with its good story and the terrific special effects to carry it. This movie is no exception. Everything that made the first movie great is back, plus they delve deeper into things they should have done in the first movie. The Pug for one and the inter-workings of the MIB to name two. Will shines in his role, Tommy knocks me out with his dead pan delivery and together they blow me away, but the best thing is from giving the Pug more screen time. His singing is the funniest thing since ever. Tony Shalhoub and Rip Torn also highlight the movie; without them, there is no movie. Rosario Dawson highlights the movie as an innocent ingenue very well too. Lara Flynn-Boyle does nasty very well; I had a dirty little smirk when she said she could rule the world with the right size of mammaries (being an alien as she was and using some computer graphics would have made for an even more interesting scene ala The Benny Hill Show). The plot is great with its expectations and then twist to the end. Definitely a worth-see !",2003

10,Men In Black ended with Agent Jay mind wiping Agent Kay so that he can live a happy life or so we think. Men In Black II opens up with Jay chasing down an alien that lives in the NYC subway system and is a threat to the city. Jay has in time become one of their best agents but he has a habit of mind wiping his partners because they don't want to be MIB agents anymore so he's kind of tainted in that respect. During all of this an alien named Serleena arrives on Earth Serleena is played to the hilt by Laura Flynn Boyle and she hams it up nicely her sidekick played by Johnny Knoxville could use a little bit of work but he does OK. Serleena arrives and takes over MIB HQ it seems she's looking for a object of great power that KAy hid long ago under the protection of a guardian. Jay Escapes and he realizes MIB's only chance is to bring Kay back to the fold restore his memories and defeat Serleena. When Tommy Lee Jones makes his appearance the movie picks up considerably and it's very nicely understood that while Smith is the maniacal energy and the comedic relief Tommy Lee Jone simply is the heart of Men In Black while Rip Torn as Zed is the Soul. Without these three actors Men In BLack would not be as good there is something about the dynamic here that the three bring to the table. My only complaint as with the first was that it was too short Sonnifeld is a gifted directer and Knows how to make great movies with the MIB series he really should think about lengthen the running time so the movie does not feel as rushed and we can enjoy it as it unfolds.,2009
10,"Nice, really nice. It has an origin mostly comic but has good special effects. It was inevitable to see negative comments here, is the norm. Cmq a good movie, the environments are good actors suited to the type of film. He certainly part ironic, comic, the environments are very well and the result can be considered as satisfactory. It is a shame that here there are elements that bring more than 7 film ridiculous as the army of darkness and films such as van helsing a miserable 5. Shame! I disagree with the standards is happening here, I am not convinced. In some cases there are good reviews, in other see that there are some 'too many prejudices against certain films!",2008

This is a terrific movie, and at the same time ultimately poignant and sad.",2005
7,"I f you thought Sam Mendes' first film, the much heralded American BEAUTY was a movie with style to spare, wait until you see his highly anticipated second effort, the unrelentingly grim 30's gangster melodrama ROAD TO PERDITION. Some critics have hailed this new movie as a worthy successor to THE GODFATHER, a rash judgment made by several reviewers taken with Mr. Mendes' extraordinary technical prowess. If the mechanics of movie making are what make a picture great, then yes, ROAD TO PERDITION is a distant cousin to THE GODFATHER in terms of what it achieves in cinematography, editing, music scoring and sound. What it doesn't have is a resonance that all great stories and some very rare movies have that stay with the viewer long after the experience of reading or seeing it is over. As with American BEAUTY, there is a cold, distancing feel to this movie, despite some very tense scenes involving paternal love, loyalty and betrayal.",2002
9,"Frankly, this movie has gone over the heads of most of its detractors.",2005
9,"This is one of the best made movies from 2002. Maybe it is not the best movie, but it looks the best, has great acting and is directed perfectly by Sam Mendes, who debuted with 'American Beauty'.",2004
10,"Acting  This film is a very well acted film. I will say that the performances  are slightly weak at times; but for the most part, the acting is very  good. The only actor that blew me away with his performance was Jude  Law as Harlen Maguire. He was incredible! Tom Hanks seemed alittle  unsure at at a few points throughout the film but he too was  incredible. Paul Newman, good as always.   Cinematography  This is what made the movie a masterpiece (and I rarely use that word).  Conrad Hall is a true genius. If at any point in the movie you were to  pause it, you will see the delicately crafted work of this man. He sets  up every shot so that nothing is left out. When the camera is still,  there is a postcard like quality to the screen. When the camera is  moving, every shot is planned to understated perfection. But it doesn't  stop there. Conrads choice of colors and contrast between light and  dark settings is a work of art. The way he lights the set is some of  the most amazing lighting work I've seen. His work on this movie made  it what it is. This movie is at the top of the list for best  Cinematography with LOTR, Black Hawk Down, Hero, CTHD, Moulin Rouge,  and Vertigo.  Story  People will say this movie is a 1930s gangster flick but, I believe  they missed the point of the movie. It is a love story about a hit-man  who fails in trying to protect his son from the life he chose. It is a  brilliantly crafted story that unfolds into a beautiful bond between  two people who have nothing but each other. The screen Writing is  worthy of an Oscar.  Music  Thomas Newman conducts a sad but hopeful score to intensify this sad  but hopeful story. The music is some of the most beautiful and moving  scores I've herd.   Direction  Sam Mendes is a new director with a feel of an experienced director.  The symbols he uses and the performances he gets from his actors is a  rarity in todays film-making world. I will be on the lookout for the  next Sam Mendes Film.  10/10 one of the most moving and beautiful movies I've ever seen.",2004
10,"Having been driven out of the house and into the theater by the sweltering heat, I could not have been more pleased. The Road to Perdition, directed by Sam Mendes (American Beauty), is destined to become one of the greatest movies of all time. Perhaps I'm just getting old; perhaps I've just seen the same themes recycled time and again. But this movie is indeed different.",2002
7,"An innocent lad gets involved in his father's underworld business by accident. This is my interpretation of the film. I don't doubt that director's intentions were the same but I think it was either poor execution of the idea or may be screenplay did not have anything new at all in the first place. I think it was all about cool shots in the rain, lighting and camera movement. Road to perdition would have been a much better film if it was not hijacked by the cinematographer. Through out the film shots are so well composed that you forget the character itself. It looks as if you are sitting in front of a TV to witness composition of each frame and not the story. I think the story is good for one hour. In the first half an hour you don't know what's going on and that the only interesting part. Once you know the characters there's nothing to watch except for rain, suits and car. Extremely overrated film. Acting wise I don't think there was a scope for any great stuff. Recommended only for film students. 7/10",2006
6,"Even though I believe this is based on a graphic novel, This movie looks like the result of someone who enamored with the 20s who wanted a vehicle for Hanks/Newman. There wasn't enough action to be an action film, there's not enough surprises to be a suspense film, and not characterization to care about the characters - particularly Michael Junior. All the tender moments with piano seemed like someone was trying to emulate Frank Darabond a bit too much. I guess I just sensed a profound lack of depth - nothing provoked any thoughts for me. Cinematography was excellent, though, as were Hank's and Newman's performances.",2006
8,"ROAD TO PERDITION can be summed up by Thomas Newman's score . It's haunting and beautiful but you're aware that this music is similar to Newman's other work and while listening to the soundtrack you're reminded of SCENT OF A WOMAN , MEETING JOE BLACK and THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION you're reminded of other films as the story unfolds on screen . As the Sullivans drive round America trying to escape from a psychotic hit man you think of THE GETAWAY , Irish gangsters is MILLER'S CROSSING whilst the subtext of guilt and redemption can be summed up by Coppola and Leone's gangster epics. Despite having a seen it all before feel this shouldn't be taken as a heavy criticism of Sam Mendes film which I repeat is haunting and beautiful and the only flaws that work against it is a very slow opening twenty minutes and I was slightly confused as the events that caused Michael Sullivan to be betrayed . But if you stop to consider how much of a sentimental mess Spielberg might have made with the story that revolves around a father and his twelve year old son running for their lives you can't help thinking what a superb director Mendes is ",2005
10,"This film really catches the viewer, and takes it on a trip back in time, into an atmosphere that is quite chilling and very interesting. Tom Hanks is really cast in a new light with his role as a father who does unorthodox work, and with a personality which at first seems quite cold and distant. He plays so great - I have to say that this film have given me a whole new view of him as an actor. His son is also played very well, and the whole cast is great. I love everything about this film. It is definitely worth watching - for the atmosphere, tension, father-son- relationship, great dramatic scenes, brilliant actors and most importantly: Every single character has a depth that is unique in a film this short (two hours) - you really get each and every character. So high on detail that it is a great experience to watch.",2012
9,"Road to Perdition is one of the few films that tries to recreate the film noir genre, while basking in the modern light. Its use of light, shadow, and water can all be classified as stylistic, and its cinematography could also get it elected into a genre so admirable. The film follows Michael Sullivan Sr. (Hanks), a hit man working for an Irish Mob boss (Newman) in 1930's Illinois. Sullivan has a loving wife (Leigh) and two plucky kids Peter (Aiken) and Michael Jr. (Hoechlin), yet tries to keep his sons oblivious to his involvement in the mobster lifestyle.",2012

There's both power and nuance in the performances of the principal players, totally miscast some would say, with Tom Hanks as a gangster/hit-man, and Paul Newman as an organized crime boss who's been like a father to him. That presumption is totally without merit, as both actors deliver incredible performances in this tale of betrayal and revenge set in the winter of 1931.",2012
10,"Road to Perdition is a simply amazing movie that was sadly overlooked at the Oscars. The acting was brilliant and I, who am not normally a fan of Tom Hanks, was simply blown away by his performance. Not only Hanks but Paul Newman and Jude Law were also great. Combined with a poignant story and stunning cinematography Road to Perdition is one of the best movies I've seen in ages.",2011
10,"I really would like to say that this was one of the most beautifully done movies I have every seen. (And I'm not talking about cinematography)The actors were superb, the setting was amazing and The theme behind it was really amazing and there was a message behind it. There was a bond between the father and his son. The movie has heart. It has a real meaning and a real message. And that's hard to find sometimes. The end it stands out in my mind. It has been almost two years since I've seen it, and it still sticks with me. It is a true gem. This is not a movie with the dazzling special effects, but it doesn't have to be... It's the message behind it that counts.",2004
10,"This is a beautiful film. The true tale of bond between father and son. This is by far, Tom Hanks at his finest. Tom Hanks is really out of the box in this movie. He usually has the nice guy roles. Yet in this film,he comes off in this film as a bit gritty, but still emerges smelling like a rose, even until the very last scene, the assassination of his character. The cast of this movie was well put together. I also love the part when there is total silence when Tom Hanks' character shoots and kills all of the men in Mr. Rooney's group. There is something chilling and yet profound about no sound in that scene, just simply emotion. I love the look on John Rooney, Paul Newman's character's face when he realizes even before seeing him, that it is Tom Hanks's character getting revenge, and he knows his fate has come. The first time I saw this movie I was blown away and knew I had to go out and get the video and I since have, adding it to my collection of my all time favorite movies.",2005
5,"There's a lot of solemnity and slowness in Sam Mendes' gangster flick 'Road to Peridition': unfortunately, this is not enough to make it a serious movie. Tom Hanks is almost unrecognisable as a hard-man (it's amazing what a little bit of stubble will do), but film buys into too many of the standard Hollywood clichés. This is a world where revenge is always justified; and where there are bad gangsters but also good ones, who only kill when provoked, who love their families, and who can mow down an entire mafia of wrong 'uns to boot. Morevoer, the film gets worse as it progresses, and the eventual ending is completely corny. I always thought 'American Beauty' was less subversive than its fans would acknowledge; 'Road to Peridition' contains not a single subversive idea. This is a watchable film, but ultimately a disappointing one as well.",2005
3,"This film is overblown, predictable, pretentious, and hollow to its core.  The settings are faithful to the era but self-conscious in their magnification by prolonged exposure.  The lingering over artifacts stops the action and cloys almost as much as the empty dialogue.  Tom Hanks seems to be sleepwalking much as Bruce Willis did in Hart's War. Tom, you can't give depth to a character simply by making your face blank! The content did not warrant the histrionic acting by Paul Newman.  This is a dud wrapped in an atomic bomb casing.",2002

In my top 10 best gangster films of all time. Classy on all counts, and the piano solo tears my heart out every time. Truly an adult film in all aspects. Along with The Usual Suspects, The Professional, Godfather(s), Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels, Goodfellas, Snatch, Millers Crossing, La Femme Nakita, Once Upon A Time In America, Oceans Eleven and another few I can't remember right now - Take it to the desert island with you when you get marooned.

8,"This is one of those shows where the main characters are driven to put aside the problems they have with each other because they know that there are more important things. Those are the kind of characters I can enjoy watching. In this case they all know that Johnny (Anthony Michael Hall) has real visions not crazy visions or psychic hotline visions, but real visions. And that they can help him thwart the events that would otherwise lead to deaths or disaster if they trust each other and work together. This leads to the compelling stories that aren't about his visions. Sarah (Nicole de Boer) and Johnny were engaged before his car accident turned 6 year coma. However, during that coma she married the local sheriff (Chris Bruno). So watching as Johnny and the sheriff become friends is very interesting. Rev. Gene Purdy (David Ogden Stiers) as the man in charge of Johnny's inheritance is also an interesting study in suspense because the viewer can't tell if he is an imperfect man trying to do good, or someone with malicious intent. Johnny's best friend Bruce (John L. Adams) is someone he can share all his secrets with and their conversation is also where some of the quality humor of the show comes through. This show is definitely one to watch.",2006

Cutting-edge graphics and subject matter, interesting twists on each show, plus compelling continuing story lines threaded throughout the individual episodes, make this a great watch. Kudos to the creators (Michael Piller and his son Shawn, who is carrying on his legacy) and actor/producer Anthony Michael Hall (he's come a long way since ""Sixteen Candles"") plus the rest of the excellent cast. The show has improved with every season, as the cast chemistry increases, rather than fades, and the story lines become even more creative instead of growing stale. Great TV in an era of yawn-same-old-same-old detective/mystery/police shows. Set it on your DVR like me and NEVER MISS ONE EPISODE!!!",2006

9,"Making a TV show out of a fantastic Stephen King (book and)movie is a bold move! But with a great Anthony Michael Hall they succeeded in creating a series full of drama and suspense! I saw things in the first three seasons that were exciting and thrilling! Almost every episode contained a surprise in some form! Anthony Michael Hall created his own character very different from the movie! He adds some humor but also is intense and even frightening when needed! The sound and visual effects that are used to show how John's visions work are one of the highlights of the show! I also liked that Johnny was constantly improving in using his ability! I don't know what happened after these three wonderful seasons! Season 4 had it's moments but already was a sign that the series was getting worse! Inconsistencies in the plot,no improvement in skill,repetitive story lines,no real surprises) I do not want to talk about fifth season,because that season doesn't even come close to what ""Dead Zone"" was! After seeing 2 episodes from the sixth season I only can conclude that this one is even worse than the fifth season! It is very disappointing to see a fantastic show being turned into a show that it is now! Nothing inventive,boring (repetitive) story lines,one major character killed off,for some reason the Armageddon is stopped (for now,just like that) and almost no John L. Adams as Bruce! I think the character of Bruce was necessary since he kept John Smith sane! And also provided some great interaction between them! It should have been better if they would have stopped this show after the third season! I will keep on watching the show for closure but I sincerely hope that the show will improve to the high level of the first three seasons!",2007
5,"I've now watched the first three episodes of this TV series based on the Christopher Walken 1993 movie adapted from Stephen King's novel. Let me start by saying I really enjoyed the original movie, a dark fantasy involving a search for a serial killer. Although one of the episodes here also involves a serial killer, the series would lose credibility if every week, the hero got to solve another baffling murder, so that I anticipate a mix of crime and human interest stories from here on.",2013
9,"Spoilers Alert: I taped the first show of the season, and overall I was not too disappointed. Yet, I wasn't hoping for too much since it is a series loosely based on characters written by Stephen King. For those that complain too much about this series, I tell you to watch the Langoliers, and wince at how awful THAT book made into a movie. I am disaapointed that Smith and Sarah (in the series) supposedly slept together and created a son before the coma. That goes totally against what the book says, but there are greater errors in the series than just that, imo. Two VITAL characters have been thrown out, Herb and Vera Smith. Herb was Johnny's father, and lived through all of Johnny's problems. Also, Vera supposedly died before Johnny came out the coma, which is just wrong in my opinion. I would have liked to see the struggle on the screen between the religious mother and pragmatic father. I will continue to tape the series, just so I can fast forward through the commercials and not waste my time on this series. I guess overall a disaapointment, but I will live. I think I will go out and buy the dvd Rose Red for real Stephen King movie, or just watch my copy of the Storm of the Century.    For die-hard King fans, even the pleasure of watching King stuff will not be worth the effort to pay attention to the Dead Zone. But, I'll spend half the effort. I just want to know how long people will think this series will last before its canceled.",2002

Adam Sandler wasn't as funny as he usually is. The story (actually a remake) is very boring and most of the jokes are old. The only actor who made me laugh was John Turturro. He plays a spanish butler with a twisted passion for feet. If you liked him in ""The Big Lebowski""(as Jesus Quintana) then maybe this is a movie for you. I give this movie a 3/10.",2002

I begged for the DVD for my birthday, and by the time I got the DVD, I was so sick of the movie that I never wanted to watch it again. I was just flipping through channels today and it was on Comedy Central, and I was trying to figure out what amazed me so much about this movie. It is corny, dull, and predictable.

In spite of its hard-to-swallow romantic side plot, the film offers nonstop in-your-face silliness and nonsense which should make it a fun watch for fans into Sandler's brand of deadpan kookie comedy.

The only difference is this time it isn't very funny. Basically, a variation on a Sandler plot- idiot savant gets filthy rich but maintains his goofy (and humorless) innocence.  The Sandler persona wears thin about 5 minutes into the movie and basically that's it.  You're stuck with a mediocre movie that a chimp could have produced.  The one I truly feel sorry for is Winona- first her shoplifting debacle and now this.  My Personal Opinion: Avoid this movie at all costs.",2002

While in New York, he meets this beautiful woman. Little does he know that she is a reporter, not a school nurse. The script/storyline/jokes are bearable, but are better with most Sandler movies. I laughed a few times during the movie. Adam Sandler did a great job acting. Winona Ryder is a bit shaky in this role. John Turturro is hilarious as the butler who just sneaks up on everyone. I also have to mention Steve Buscemi as Crazy Eyes. That is what you call good comedy(referring to Crazy Eyes). There are some great songs to listen in this film. Overall, this is a good film but Sandler has done better films. I rate this movie 8/10.",2008

His real ambition, however, is to write verse for Hallmark's greeting cards. Yet, so far, every rhyme he has sent them has been rejected. That does not matter to the townies, who love hearing Deeds recite his poems at the restaurant. One day, a billionaire (Howard Keel) dies on top of Mount Everest. He leaves no will, making it necessary for his huge company to seek out any heirs. You guessed it, Deeds is a long-lost nephew who inherits a boatload of dough. The company manager, Chuck (Peter Gallagher) wants to give Deeds 42 billion to sell his stock shares back to him. Deeds agrees at first. But, once he gets to his uncle's posh Manhattan mansion where servant Emilio (John Turturro) waits on him hand and foot, Deeds has second thoughts. Not only that, but he meets a beautiful local lady named Pam (Winona Ryder) and he is enchanted by her. But, beware, Deeds. Pam is really a reporter named Babe who is out to get dirt on him. And, are there indeed secrets to uncover? Who will end up with the money? This is really a sunny film for a rainy day. It is lighthearted fun with an absolutely terrific cast. Sandler is quite funny, of course, but John Turturro steals every one of his scenes with a performance that should have garnered him an Oscar. It's THAT good, yes. Ryder, Steve Buscemi, Gallagher, and many others are true delights as well. Then, too, the film looks amazing, from the costumes to the sets and beyond. It appears that no expense was spared and the result is a lovely-to-look-at film, too. Finally, the script is imaginative and humorous, making the viewer chuckle and grin nonstop.

1,Over the years there have been many chauvanistic male movie characters who produce stereotypical images to the viewers. However if we look at 40 days and 40 nights and flip the plot around so that it is a girl who has to go the aforementioned length of time without having sex and we no longer have a comedy but an extremely offensive movie.,2005
2,Hollywood and their incredible shallowness wants it's viewers to care a lot for the main character in this film and it's because he's good looking. Nothing more than that and I took an instant disliking to this ridiculous attempt at comedy and the rest of the characters are portrayed as either vapid or moronic. Story is about Matt Sullivan (Josh Hartnett) who is having a very difficult time getting over his breakup with Nicole (Vinessa Shaw) and he goes out with several girls but they don't amount to anything and he becomes disgusted by his own behavior. Matt decides to give up sex for Lent and at first he seems okay with it but as time goes on it gets very difficult and while at the laundromat he meets a new woman.,2004
6,"SPOILERS Each year, we all claim we're going to give up something for Lent. Whether for religious reasons, physical reasons or even for a bet, we all have attempted, and mostly failed, to sacrifice those things we need the most. It'd be interesting to know how many have attempted to sacrifice sexual activity for that time. In 2002's '40 Days and 40 Nights', Josh Hartnett's character tries just that. Crammed full of sexual reference and incredibly dumb moments, '40 Days and 40 Nights' is saved from the oblivion where it so obviously belongs by the pure fact that it is occasionally entertaining. Yes it never makes you fall off your seat in laughter, and the characters are incredibly shallow, but more often than not, you can't help but find yourself smiling.",2005
1,"It is self evident that the makers of this movie have never tried to do what they have the protagonist of the story attempt. They make it out as if it's some sort of unattainable fantasy vice a lifestyle choice. 40 Days and 40 Nights is based off a singular idea: men can't live without sex. Actually, it's based off a more basic idea than even that: men can't control themselves. This movie contains an attempted drugging, sexual harassment, sexual molestation, and outright rape and we're supposed to just laugh it off because it happens to a man. And as we all know, men can't go more than 7 seconds without thinking about sex. This is a horrible, propaganda filled, hateful little piece of indoctrination that deserves the death penalty at the very least.",2013
3,"This movie is awful on so many levels, it's difficult to choose what to focus on. First of all, the main characters are horribly underdeveloped. Josh Hartnet's character hardly speaks throughout the movie, and while Erica, his new love interest, does a decent job expressing her ""sensitivity"" through her body language, her character is equally undeveloped. And while Hartnet's character may be a heart throb, do girls really throw themselves at guys so hard and fast that it's that difficult to turn down sex? If this movie was meant for teens, then the producers did young people a horrible injustice by making twenty-something life look so shallow. In the beginning of the film, he's getting tail like its on sale at Costco. The caricatured version of a hot, male bachelor's life makes the movie unbearably cartoonish. SPOILERS: Then, when Erica and Matt (is that Josh's character's name?) they fall in love so fast, after one date. This is problematic because Erica is SOOOOO upset when she learns about his ""vow"". Why wouldn't they just have a calm conversation about it and her ask why he's doing what he's doing? It's not like they know each other that well. OK, and the orgasm scene with the flower--meant to be hot, was embarrassing and contrived. I could imagine that scene being very hot, but something about the way the actors acted it made me blush in embarrassment—not because it was sexually arousing, but because it wasn't. Matt's ex-girlfriend is equally caricatured, and dumps him for a rich young partner at Stanley Morgan. Finally, SPOILERS: the RAPE SCENE AT THE END. What the hell?? I can't believe the producers put that in there—not because it wouldn't ever happen, but that Matt blames himself for it. Is Matt really that much of a screwed up catholic? And the final scene when Matt talks about how he just kept screwing up and screwing up. How did he ""screw up?"" everyone else seemed to--his jackass friends for betting on his celibacy, but not him for ""taking a break."" Finally, one last stab at the movie—it just wasn't funny. I laughed hard once (can't remember when), but that good chuckle didn't make up the piece of crap this film is.",2010
1,"Hollywood writers are largely egotistical, juvenile, spoiled, shallow, hedonistic, amoral, arrogant, and totally disconnected from the day-to-day world most of us ""nobodys"" live in. Once in a great while, something seeps into the scripts they write that's so extreme in it's reprehensibility it reveals their delusional view of the world. That's what happened with this movie, but since it wasn't a wildly popular blockbuster that was in the theatres for several months, it was mostly ignored. At the end of this movie a man is raped by a woman in a context that makes it clear that the writers think it's a good thing. Knowing the stupid plot of the movie doesn't make it any better. Matt (Josh Harnett) just had a bad break-up with a girl and decides he would get a better perspective on women and relationships if he went without sex during the 40 days of Lent, including kissing and masturbation. He meets a woman, but continues his experiment in sexual abstinence without explaining his experiment to her, just saying he wants a platonic relationship. I'll admit I didn't follow every detail of the plot and sub-plots (he's some kind of executive and has a lot of obnoxious roommates and co-workers) but I figure nothing could justify the rape at the end. There is a sequence where he's so aroused and frustrated he dreams he's flying through a landscape of CGIed breasts, which I guess is relatively imaginative. Near the end of the movie he goes to bed, as always handcuffed to the bedposts so he can't masturbate. His ex-girlfriend gets on top of him and RAPES HIM! If the sexes were reversed there'd be a public outcry about this movie that would be pretty considerable even though the movie wasn't extremely well- known. I think what the so-called writers think is that men having sex whenever they can get it and perpetually pursuing sex like mindless animals the rest of the time is the natural order of Nature and any man who goes against that is denying nature and is not a real man and deserves to be FORCED back into sexual activity, in other words deserves to be RAPED. In their minds, the abstinence is the twisted thing and the rape is the healthy thing. Of course movies are primarily entertainment and some people, mostly women I guess, would get a kick out of seeing a healthy, good-looking young guy constantly horny and teased and frustrated, but the movie doesn't even work on that dark level because Hartnett doesn't react the way most men would. Most of the other characters in the film are shallow, obnoxious twenty- somethings who act like 12-year-olds and I can't help thinking that this must be pretty close to what the writers act like. There are a lot of jokes about embarrassment over having erections at work. This isn't the worst movie ever made - that honor I think belongs to ""Forrest Gump"" - only because ""40 Days and 40 Nights"" is useful in the way it reveals the society-induced mental disorders of the ""writers"".",2012

7,"Josh Hartnett is a good looking kid who does not use his looks to put up a wall between him and the audience in this movie.  He seems very human and sweet.

1,"This film reflects the decadence of Hollywood. Now a days, every incompetent being, each stupider than the last one, may get to direct a movie, or even worst, to write a script. That's the only possible explanation to the fact that this movie ever came out. Technically the movie is really lame. In fact I strongly doubt there was anyone involved in the production of this film that was aware that there exist techniques to shoot a movie. There's no photography management, no aesthetics careness, no nothing that would justify the one big and completely flaw by antonomasia that the script is. The only attempt of innovation you may find in the movie is the 100% computer animated sea of mammary glands waving all along the screen as the central character is supposed to be having an alucination. Concerning the script, there isn't a single part of it that doesn't deserve to go straightly to the trash bin. I strongly recommend, as well, that Mr. Rob Pérez dedicates the rest of his life in another work, as good as he makes sure it doesn't involve writing. The plot is just absurd (spoiler?). A guy swears to god that he won't have sex for the next 40 days, and what's worst: the entire community around him is so stupid and has nothing better to do in their own lives, that they run a hi-tech bet system in which they bet to the day they think the oath will be broken. Give it a 5 second thought. If your neighbour doesn't want to have sex: do you really give a damn about it??? Will your life start to work around that fact??? of course not!!! The movie it self doesn't have sense!!! Not even to mention the predictability of it. From the very beginning of the movie you know how it's going to end. And the gags and jokes, that were supposed to be the strong side of the movie, don't get to work at all. In all the time I wasted watching this movie, not ever once my lips showed a glimpse of a smile.",2004
3,"I didn't find any redeeming qualities in this movie.  I knew going in the movie was kind of based on the sophomoric premise that a sexually active young man was giving up sex for Lent.  The movie also purports to be a comedy.  So, almost all of the humor of the film revolves around Matt's (Josh Hartnett) attempt at celibacy, while apparently in his world every woman is young beautiful, and willing to have sex with him.  So, you get lots of scenes of him gasping in frustration running away from women while putting ice down his pants.  I found the humor witless, and below the standards of ""Porky's"" or typical teenage drive-in type movies.",2002

But then of course he meets the girl of his dreams, named Erica(Shannyn Sossamon) and he starts having second thoughts about not having sex and betraying his vow. Of course you can guess the rest. This movie is predictable, dumb and just a big piece of crap. Nothing about this movie was funny or entertaining. The movie sends out wrong messages to it's audience and it's just a pain in the butt to sit through. There weren't even enough hot girls to save this movie from the big piece of crap it is.

It's a lot harder than it sounds, because Mr. Harnett vows to give up ALL forms of sexual activity, including masturbation.

8,"Michael Lehman's ""40 Days and 40 Nights"" is a surprisingly funny, smart, edgy romantic comedy with an amazing sweetness to it. This is a feat given some of the graphic dialog, and outrageous sight gags. Credit the star power of Josh Hartnett, the skillful direction of Michael Lehman, and a brisk and ""in your face"" screenplay by Rob Perez. The movie intends to offend, and we give it permission to do so-- the effect is a fun time at the movies. ",2002
1,"Text taken from ""HEP632"" : I could go on in that vein for hours, but what REALLY made me almost walk out on this film is the fact that Matt, the hero, is RAPED by is ex-girlfriend in the final minutes of the movie. Did nobody at the studio recognize that act for what it is? If the gender roles were reversed in that scene, it would have totally changed the mood and content of the film. As it was, I kept waiting for Matt, or ANYBODY, to call the police. Instead, movie goes get a happy ending where Matt's new girlfriend finally FORGIVES HIM FOR BEING RAPED. Hooray for Hollywood.",2002

1,"It's sad that so many talented, hard-working musicians out there have been busting their ass for years and can't get a break, while any soulless, talentless suburban poser can go on what is basically a nationally-televised karaoke contest, become the flavor of the month, and then be forgotten about six months later(unless you're Kelly Clarkson). I know it's already been said by another poster, but it's true: some of these people have played in small bands or had local solo gigs, some of them have potential, but the majority of them are a bunch of wannabes with no real talent. They don't have the dedication and desire it takes to build a lasting career in a notoriously fickle industry: they're in it for their 15 minutes of fame, and nothing more.",2007

I've totally lost all faith in humanity for allowing a show like this to go on and on and on.Years ago, a show like this (think 'Star Search' for example) was the exception rather than the norm. Now it's all you can find. Reality programming has completely ruined TV. Granted, there's still some pretty decent scripted shows on the tube (Monk, 30 Rock, My Name is Earl, The Office) but as long as people line up mindlessly to watch muck like 'American Idol', I'm afraid it's only gonna get worse.

5,"I've watched every episode of this show from its inception, and, sadly but not surprisingly, I have seen it become more and more cheesy as the years go by. ",2007
1,I can't believe that people willfully watch this show. It's such a waste of time watching people embarrass themselves on national television. Shows like this one are the reason why America is full of morons and the reason why the Chinese and Japanese are going to own this country in the coming decades. The only reason shows like this are even on t.v. is the fact that corporate television executives are so greedy that instead of making t.v. shows that at the very least give a wholesome message or bring awareness to the public about a certain issues they look for any way to squeeze every penny they can and stick it in their own pockets instead of spending it on something worthwhile or educational. Don't watch shows like this. Read a book instead. Spend time with your kids. Get an education. Do something worthwhile with your life.,2009
2,"The basic premise behind American Idol, a talent show in which a large number of contestants battle it out to get a recording contract, is one that has inspired a number of films and television shows. The problem is that the idea is one rooted firmly in the 1960s, when the Recording Industry Assocation of America was relevant, people's tastes were so underdeveloped that one genre would capture most of the world's attention, and the so-called top ten actually reflected what people were buying. But the revelations of the past twenty or so years have turned that entire notion on its head. No longer do we believe that the top ten is actually a reflection of our tastes (in fact many articles have been published to the effect that the pop charts are rigged), and the RIAA no longer has sole control over how we hear artists. In fact, independent, underground recording labels have seen their business explode tenfold since the MP3 revolution, and for the first time in history, the advertising of recording artists has truly become a level playing field.",2007
1,"It is wholly inexplicable and mystifying that a nation could be so obsessed with a show like this, a worthless, fifteen-minutes-of-fame, trashy-so-it's-bad piece of garbage that captivates more collective attention than the average Presidential race. Constantly, I am forced to hide in my room when this show comes on because it overrides all other shows where I live. With paper-thin walls, I can hear every minute of it: the generic pop voices, the horrible auditions at the beginning of every season that throw pathos out the window, and the growing absurdity of the judge's sweetness, complacency, and ruthlessness. It is by far a more rewarding experience to watch unintelligent programs mock this show than it is to watch it itself-- ""Shrek 2,"" anyone? And ""American Idol Rewind,"" a vapid expansion of the show's early years, is even more heinous and pointless. Yet people continue to watch the competition, from talentless winners (Kelly Clarkson, Clay Aiken, Taylor Hicks, etc.) to unique, worthwhile losers (Daughtry!) But guess what. Even Chris Daughtry hates it when people mention his appearance on this show. Because it is, in its own, Idol way, a puerile, infantile, mindless and banal exercise in finding the next unlikely hero to throw through the ruthless pop culture gum-ball machine. A word of advice to the people who actually tune in every January: go and watch the classic 1981 movie musical ""Shock Treatment.""

1,"Too bad you can't give stuff zeros. That would've been my vote because American Idol is a cancer to society and the world. The only people worse than the arrogant judges and attention-whoring contestants are the followers. Nobody can justify the popularity of the show, and yet there are people who believe this thing matters more than the Oklahoma-Oregon football game. Another disgusting aspect of the show is that people think it's funny. Believe me, it's as funny as seeing Oklahoma slaughter Texas A&M 77-0 in a football game or USC pound the Sooners themselves, 55-19. There is no difference between humiliating somebody on a football field and crushing somebody who can't sing but is trying. Anyone with those beliefs should die or be my slaves. If American Idol is around in 2015, you'll know something is wrong. Those who disagree ought to suffer endlessly. There are actual forms of entertainment that people can watch over this crap. Stuff like Oz, Saved by the Bell, Jackass, Family Guy.",2007

I guess people like to watch it to watch others suck, but that just shows how cruel people can be. On top of that, Simon is a rude, stuck-up jackass who has it in his head that he can tell people they have no talent. Who the hell does this guy think he is? I'd like to see him get up and sing before he says ANYTHING to anybody about their singing, and I sincerely wish that somebody would get up and tell Simon ""bite me."" I don't why or how this show got to be so popular, and I really wish the show would just go away because I'm tired of it. It needs to go off the air soon.

They've assembled a tight trio of judges with good natured rapport and enough of a comprehensive critical eye to weed through the shallow, fame-craving riff-raff . . . however . . . I am here to bury Idol, not to praise it! At most the show is a guilty pleasure, as hollowly insubstantial as it is trite. It's best fit as passive, ultimately forgettable recreation for a preadolescent audience with no other life concern except perhaps their schoolwork. The final irony is that all of the ""American Idols"" picked by the judges and the viewers, with the possible exception of Carrie Underwood, have sooner or later vanished from the formerly adoring public eye that created them! Despite this repeated repudiation of its mere existence, the ungainly behemoth that is American Idol nonetheless slouches towards us each seasonal cycle, waiting to be born anew in all its false idolatric 'splendor' . . .",2008
1,"I hate this show with a passion. At first it was a good idea and picked a good singer. When saying there was going to be another one, i though ""Ok i guess America could have *2* idols..."" but when Rubin won, i knew this was a corrupt show that only cares about image. I was so happy when people began voting for the worst. This show deserves it. And the judges have no purpose if the show is ""determined"" by America. Randy's ""yo yo yo"" is just old and annoying, Paula as the ""nice one"" is quickly becoming annoying, Simons sarcastic British comments are becoming overly done and Ryan Seacrest is possibly *the* most annoying host on television. He is so full of himself and has no place in the show. People should know by now that the show is corrupt and that ""America"" can't vote for their life.",2007
1,"can we vote Simon off? He is beyond rude. His gross comments have nothing to do with their talent or need to improve. I really like the show but Simon ruins it. He should be replaced with at least a person who knows music and can comment without being abusive to the person. This year the talent is great but again Simon is too gross for the show. I may use DVR and then I can skip through him. As it is now I just mute when it when it's his turn to comment. Surly there's someone ho loved to be a judge and be much more entertaining than Simon. I'm really curious how many people would like to see him replaced. Again, can we vote him off?",2008
7,"Far too much of this show is pathetic. From the cheap looking stage to the under choreographed numbers to the sugary judges, this show frequently misses the mark. But there are some fine singers. Most of them have the pipes, it's just control that they lack, a good singer knows when to not use their powerful voice. Sometimes, in some numbers, you can see what the show was intended to be, a display of top talent fighting for break. The high note for me is the unflinching honesty of Simon Cowell. While Randy Jackson and Paula Abdul spent too much time glad handing decent performances, but Simon keeps his emotions in check, trying to dispense advice. Too often he is put down by window dresser Ryan Secrest for not having fun. It's refreshing to listen to someone try to honestly dissect a performance and for those who think he is too harsh, a lot of people will be telling these contestants that they aren't good enough, it's time for them move past their natural talent and grow thicker skin. The greatest performers have a work ethic to match their talent, that is what should be idolized.",2007
1,"How such a shallow and pathetic show can succeed so much? Making fun of people that look weird and build a career to talentless shallow people like Kelly Clarckson, has nothing to do with music. This show kills music. And it got 5.0 stars here! This thing should get a ZERO! The funny thing is that just people who look good, can win it. The massage this show tries to tell is: just ignorant shallow and, of course BEAUTIFUL people can be what they call ""singers"". This is painful to watch. Reality-junk TV show like this should get canceled, I can't believe this show still runs, when there are many other good shows out there that get canceled. Don't waste your time on this thing.

Not to mention the relentless beating of the dead horse with Idol Rewind and the hours spent on showcasing the worst of the worst in American Karaoke.

This show, as we know, is in simple terms a popularity contest. That is to say, the contestants compete against one another for the popular votes of the audience; the winner is named the Idol of America. Have we not all heard the worshiping cheers of fans? Seen results of the throngs of worshipers who pick up their phones to vote? Maybe it was clever the first season, but... The show has generated a more loyal following than many religious cults. What causes this phenomenon to perpetuate – is it the astonishing skill of the yet-unknown in America? - the search for an idol? Actually, it seems that the power of a vote has caught the fantasies of millions. It isn't the talent that keeps the phone ringing, but the belief that my own vote(s) can show America what real talent is.

However, it is slightly worrying to see that contestants are at times being mocked indirectly...this didn't use to be the case in previous seasons. Personally I think that many reality shows are beginning to adopt this sort of 'us and them' stance, where the audience feels superior to the brave contestant on-screen. Although, I am glad to say that this isn't the case with AI! I think the show has got better this season, partly due to a new fresh-faced presenter: Cat Deeley. She gives the show a new spin and has livened it up a little. The last few weeks of each season which run up to the final are always great, as the standard of singing and performance becomes sky - high. You end up seeing some really talented singers, and often a diverse collection of finalists. This makes for some great shows.",2007

For the first forty minutes it was a warm, if slightly generic, road movie about the positives of friendship and following your dreams... Then, after that point, I started to feel it turn into a Steel Magnolias clone. It was now apparently the type of film where the girls all sit around in a sewing circle, and discuss their problems. I suppose this is fine if you feel like these are real issues and you can relate to them, but when they feel as though they've been cribbed from the pages of 'Dear Abby...

There's the sexy one, there's the smart one, there's the one who wants to make it big, and of course my boyfriend. Of course it's not oscar worthy, or the movie of the year. But it's cute. Kind of cheesy, but fun. So what if you're not a Britney Spears fan, if you hate this movie just because someone you don't like is in it, you have to be a pretty shallow person.

Sure, Britney can't act too well, but she can sing, and this movie is actually a LOT better than Glitter, Mariah Carey's similarly-themed vehicle.

The movie isn't as god-awful as everyone says, but I wouldn't recommend it either. The story itself has been done before (see Boys on the Side), and you can predict the whole movie in the first 5-10 minutes. You also have to suspend some belief (they should still be broke). If you accept the movie for what it is, a coming of age story of 3 very different girls that would appeal to the tween and early teenagers, it's passable. If you're a guy, don't waste your time.

And it's so silly, like Britney's character writing that poem that turns out to be the lyrics to that stupid, ' not a girl, not yet a woman', whatever it is.  And then the guy writes music for it and she automatically starts singing along perfectly, she automatically knows the tune even though she hasn't heard it yet, and so forth.

Britney Spears being smart and getting picked on at school is unbelievable enough, but NO they had to throw in a almost sex scene with a nerd, which would NEVER happened, a girl with that good looks would get alot better.

On the other hand, her character was just as boring and cuddly-wuddly as you'd expect. The film is just terribly, horribly predictable. I watched it with a few friend (we said to ourselves `Let's just watch it so we have it over with and can discuss how terrible it was!'), and one of them said `Before we see it, let me try and predict what will happen'. And he was very accurate and he never saw the movie before (if you watch it twice you have too much sparetime) or heard anyone tell the story of it. The director should be shot, the scrip-writer should have his hands cut off and the producer should be put on a spaceshuttle and sent into outer space. Yes, it's really that bad.

Only die hard Britney haters will lie and say she was terrible. However (as noted above), the movie itself is a steaming terd. Everyone involved with this car wreck apparently had their own agendas and ideas for what it should be.  The simple plot and immature dialogue are geared (intentionally I HOPE) towards younger children, while the strong sexual content is clearly adult oriented.

9,"There is a lot to say about this show, there really is. I remember watching this show when it first came on, the premise had intrigued me, and I was a comic book fan, so I was really alienated by watching a show with barbara gordon, it really is like watching Batman Beyond or the TAS or even the movies when comparing to the comics, but this is by no means a bad thing. Just as every reviewer has, the plot is about Batman and Catwoman, Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle's child and her affiliation with her mentor/ best friend Barbara Gordon who is now Oracle and the new addition to the team Dinah Lance, which so far it feels like an Elseworlds BOP comic, and that is exactly how it plays out. It revels in the mythology, but adding or taking anything away from it. For instance, the Catwoman and Batman portrayed are obviously Batman Returns material, which by all means isn't bad. Unless you're a fan of the mythos as presented in post-1986 DC, then you may have to adjust, for in reality it is an assembly of many things, No Man's Land's Earthquake for instance, but none of this bad, by all means it is far from it.",2004
3,"This series really had a lot going for it. Too bad they couldn't hire better writers. If you saw the first episode then that's all you needed to see because every episode after it was exactly the same. They basically kept recycling the same script over and over again. Introduce lame villain-of-the-week (trust me, they were lame), one of the three girls develops a personal vendetta against the villain, against everyone's wishes she sets out to kill villain on her own, other girls swoop in and save the day, girl with personal vendetta learns her lesson (teamwork and justice not revenge and blah, blah, blah). Lesson learned until the next episode when the exact same thing happens all over again but with a new bad guy. It all got very tiring, very fast. Nothing new ever happened and character development was practically non-existent. Another flaw was that due to pressure from the teen-friendly WB network, the producers were forced to replace one of the characters from the comics with a new teenage character who was so full of angst that you wanted to smack her. She was also worthless. Think Dawn from ""Buffy"" only more annoying. Based on the premise alone, I really wanted to like this show but I was never given a good enough reason to like it. A wasted effort.",2007
9,"""Birds of Prey"" was a show that could have been little more than a guilty pleasure. But it turned out to be one of the best live-action comic-book adaptations ever done for TV. (Maybe *the* best - it's not exactly a competitive field.)",2013
7,"This is a short lived TV series that aired on the WB network(now the cw)in 2002. This is the first live action TV series based on the iconic batman comics since the classic 60's TV show. The producers of the great WB show Smallville produced this show. I used to watch this show and I eventually got it on DVD. I feel like this show had a lot of potential but was a miss opportunity. I'm a huge batman/comic book fan so I have a lot to say. First,the show is loosely based on a spin-off comic series of the same name, with the former bat-girl working with two female heroes, huntress and black canary. Which sounds like a great idea for a fresh take for a batman TV series. But the show made some good and bad changes. In the show ""the huntress"" is the daughter of batman & catwoman, this is the original origins for her in the comics but was quickly changed to the huntress having no connection to batman & catwoman. Barber Gordan was the original bat girl & daughter of commissioner Gordan but in a 1988 comic book she was shot by the joker and paralyze from the waist down and became ""Oracle"", a professor x like mentor to the huntress & black canary. They stayed pretty true to her in this show. Black Canary is one of the few batman characters that have a super power, a sonic scream. But she only appears in one episode, but her daughter of the same name took her place in the show. The show then added something unique, that batman left Gotham city, so it's just the girls. The show starts off strong with a great back story prolong in the pilot episode. Batman's butler Alfred tells the story of a war between Batman & the joker that brought down joker's empire, he got his revenge by killing catwoman, who batman was in love with and paralyzed bat girl, which caused batman to leave Gotham in guilt. The best part of the entire show is this prolong which featured a cameo by Mark Hamil as the voice of the joker, saying the world's creepiest knock-knock joke and his best joker laugh ever. And the main villain of the show is Harley Quinn, the joker's girlfriend & henchwoman, out to avenged the joker. This is all a great set-up & premise for a new batman show, so went wrong? Despite, a great premise you need good episodes to keep you involved. First the star, the huntress played by Ashley Scott, could'eve been a better character then she was. Scott didn't do a bad job but they should'eve made her more like the comics with her purple outfit and cross-bows. Her back story was good but it was weird that she wore no costume and wore no mask, she just had a black duster. The writers tried to make her tough & rebellious like in the comics but I felt the writers could never find the right balance for her, she came off as too unlikeable at times. The best part of the show was Diana Meyer as Oracle, she looks just like a older Barber Gordan and played the part perfectly. She was smart, logical everything Barbra should be. They also have the watchtower base Oracle operates from. Rahel Skarsten as Diana Lance but despite having the same name she was not Black Canary. ""Canary"" appeared in episode 6 as Diana's mom and as a possible set-up for Diana to take her mom's place. But she did not have the canary's power, her power was to see into a person future by touching them. It would'eve been a lot better to just make ""the canary"" like how she is in the comics. Here she's a little too much like the annoying little kid who wants to be in the action but told to stay ""here"". I like seeing Alfred as a regular and it's a good connection to batman. The biggest problem is that the show didn't draw more from the comics, the villains were mostly created for the show and not that great, like one guy can turn into water. It would'eve been better to see the riddler,bain, scarecrow, & others as villains then the new ones they created. Mr. Zsasz, a villain too violent for the cartoons but would'eve been great to see here. Lady Sheiva, from the comics, appears, but just OK here. Harley Quinn played by Mia Sara came off as too serious not wacky like in the comics & cartoons. But I still like the way Mia played her and it was nice to see a live action version of one of my favorite villains, Harley, as the main villain no less. But the worst thing are the plot holes. They made the season finale knowing they wouldn't be coming back but failed to fill these holes.The final episode showed that Clayface killed catwoman but no mention of the joker or how he found out about batman & catwoman or how Joker knew bat girl's identity. Harley Quinn reveals her self as the main villain but how could Oracle or Alfred not know who she is when they fought the joker. And they never explained how she escaped jail time after her crimes with the joker. The season finale really had nothing too do with previous episodes and tied no lose ends. But I enjoyed watching Mia Sara finally act wacky as Harley Quinn. But they should'eve had her wear her court jester costume, that would'eve been great! The show had a great premise but the weekly episodes should'eve been better.",2012

8,"For the rest of you, though, this mammoth 250 minutes horror miniseries, is well worth the time. Stephen King has probably created one of his best screenplay-to-screen only works (not based on a novel) in ""Rose Red"", a chore usually not too successful (""Sleepwalkers"", anyone?). This haunted house tale, about a creepy enormous mansion in Seatle, and the intrepid psychics that go there for a ""field trip"", boasts amazing production design and sets, fine acting, especially by Nancy Travis as the determined Joyce Reardon and Matt Ross as Emery (""Go and warn someone who isn't broke!), and decent special effects (especially considering this is made for TV). Although not everything is always clear, and although the middle part tends to sag a little, this is a high quality mini-series which amazingly manages to sustain interest through four hours of haunted house shenanigans, one of the most overused themes in horror. It's length also allows it to dedicate the first hour to character development and story buildup, so that when the characters walk for the first time into ""Rose Red"", we are almost as anxious as they are. this wouldn't have worked in a two hour film.",2003
10,"Someone said this was ""too long"" and made the comment that longer books don't translate well to screen.  However, if they knew anything about Rose Red, they would know that it was never a book.  It was written directly for the screen by Stephen King.  As I watched the film, I kept thinking how much it was like a novel come to life!  Then I was watching the featurette ""The Making of Rose Red"" on the DVD and Stephen King as well as the director said that it was really just a novel that was played out on screen.  It is so true! I am an avid fan of King's work, and this film was a real treat, because it was just like reading one of his books.  It it not SUPPOSED to be your typical 90 minute work (as King says, he feels like that is similar to stealing all the towels in the hotel room and then quickly packing them into your bag and sitting on it to try to force them to stay in).  It is much more character driven and rich, and takes much more attention than a regular film does.  That is WHY it was a 3 part series!  ",2003
9,"Rose Red is basically an uncredited remake of The Haunting, based on Shirley Jackson's 1959 novel, The Haunting of Hill House. The novel was first made into a film by Robert Wise in 1963. Jan de Bont did a much-loathed remake, which I prefer to the Wise film, in 1999. Novelist Stephen King, who wrote the script for Rose Red, has long said that Jackson's book is one of his favorites, and he's a fan of the Wise film. The Jackson book has greatly influenced his work. I don't recall ever hearing King's opinion of the de Bont remake, but I could imagine that he might not have cared for it very much.",2005
8,"There are so many of King's books that didn't go over well as movies. And this one, which was never even a book, did really well. If you have a Friday night and a lot of popcorn to kill, this is a decent one to settle down with. A lot of the actors are unknown, but pull this off well. I like how it's not just a group of people going to spend the night in a haunted house and win money and fame shtick. (i.e. the new House on Haunted Hill) I also liked how all the people who went had a unique specialty in the paranormal/supernatural. Also, it has the regular blend of characters you love to hate, ones who are suspicious, and the adorable ones that you hope don't make the mistake of investigating unknown noises in the middle of the night alone.",2005
8,"Though most people did not appreciate this movie due to lack of insight, I still found it interesting and mentally exercising. I do agree that some of the down time should have been used to go into depth on the characters but it also makes me use my mind to fill in the blanks which could make the movie even more fun and eccentric. Stephen King knows how to tap into peoples minds. This movie didn't scare me or make me jump at the time I was watching it. It was a few days later when I actually started to think about it and analyze it that it struck a cord. It makes you think about the possibilities and consequences. Well all in all I liked this mini series and though I do think they could have done better, it was still mentally captivating.",2005
5,"Once upon a time there was an author who could spin a good yarn about some horrific occurrence in some place, namely Maine, or Colorado. He had a way of slowly enveloping the reader with characters caught in a mystery that partially revealed itself, and while delving into the supernatural, plausibility was never sacrificed in lieu of ridiculousness.",2005
6,"Okay, when I first heard of this film I was quite skeptical.  Although I had enjoyed other SK miniseries' I did not believe that anything could make the haunted house horror films good again.  I, however, was totally wrong. This film is great, it had action and horror and the acting was surperb. Julian Sands was excellent as he always is and the others were good too.  The only thing that I did not like was the little girl who ""woke up"" the house.  I do not like child actors if only for the simple fact that very little of them can actually act, this girl was no exception.  Other than that it was a great film.",2002
2,"Stephen King screen adaptations have a well known history of being hit-or-miss (mostly miss). However I was prepared to give this a try, especially since I've regarded his made-for-tv stuff quite highly since ""The Stand"" (which I regard as one of the best mini-series ever).",2002
6,Is it just me or is Rose Red a rehash of The Shining? Everything about this screams unoriginality and if you watch it carefully you will notice lots of things in common with The Shining! Big creepy place haunted by evil ghosts who want a psychic kid who can see them so they can grow stronger. It was an interesting watch but there's only one problem....it wasn't scary! That's probably why the DVD got a 12 rating in the UK! Some of the acting was cheesy or over the top but Julian Sands acting was superb. This is just Stephen King trying to make a quick buck and just did a quick remix of one of his classic title's. If this was written by anyone else but Stephen King it would be acceptable but i don't expect this off a man of his calibre! And the obvious cameo by Mr King is just so grrrr unsubtle that it's just throwing the fact that it's Stephen King in our faces (when the guy who wrote it has his name much bigger than the title on the front of the DVD you got to start wondering) and to make you think it's got to be good if he appears in a 30 second cameo. Some of the effects annoy me like the bee's and the exploding sink which are obviously not realistic enough (the statue effect is quite cool though). If you haven't seen either of The Shining's then watch this first because you might get more entertainment from Rose Red.,2004
1,"Start with ""Burnt Offerings,"" throw in a healthy portion of ""The Haunting,"" lift scenes directly from ""Firestarter"" and ""The Shining"" (whole, no changes) give it the ending from ""Carrie"" and you have ""Rose Red"" -- without a storyline, of course, and characters who have no motivation (Why was Joyce Reardon so obsessed with the house?  Why was she having an affair with the latest owner?).  The special effects might have redeemed this waste of film and time were they not so reminiscent of the Crypt Keeper and his ghoulish puppet friends.  I want my six hours back.",2002

10,"This movie is well over 4 hours long and I hardly noticed. Remarkably, there is very little slow down and there is enough story to fill the space. The concept of a group of people staying in a haunted/evil house has been tried many times (Haunting, House on Haunted Hill and many more) but this one is unique. Rose Red is a Large mansion that has been in the same family for many years. Many people have been known to die there and the last remaining family member gives permission for a weekend ghost hunting retreat. A group of psychics is recruited to stay in the house under the ""leadership"" of a psychology/supernatural professor (Nancy Travis), who is very energetic and obsessed with Rose Red. The group, I thought, worked very well together and each had their own unique psychic abilities, which all play there part as a whole in understanding the house. Once the group is situated in the house, it is non-stop thrills, action, twists and pretty good special effects. The acting was above par, especially Julian Sands (Nick), whose character and portrayal was entertaining and convincing. All in All, all the actors did a good job of playing off each other's talents and characters. Very complimentary. Overall, there is a lot involved in this movie and it does have it's share of suspense, scary moments and originality. Even at 4+ hours in length, I would watch this again.",2002

1,"Since I read some reviews on the net concerning this series, saying this was a very scary miniseries, I had high hopes for this one. But what a disappointment. Not for a moment was the story or the dialog gripping or scary. Not even the ghosts where scary. And then the casting: Nancy Travis is terrible as a non-convincing 'professor', she even isn't convincing when she gets 'evil'-ish. Every minute she's ruining the series. The rest (except maybe Julian Sands & Matt Ross) couldn't set a decent character on screen. And then the plot: I'm a fan of Stephen King, but when he steals a storyline, I'm beginning to think that the accident also took away most of his creativity, because it borrows heavily on The House of Leaves from Mark Z. Danielewski, and since he doesn't want to put the book on the silverscreen, Stephen thought, if he doesn't want to, I can do it. But please, not this bad!",2002

The president of the organization David Talbot (Paul McGann) tells that they should only observe and lends to her Lestat's journal.

1,"This film was basically set up for failure by the studio. One, Anne Rice (author of the book) offered to write the screen play but was refused by the studio. Two, they tried to stuff 2 in depth novels in to a 2hour movie.",2005
1,"This movie was a good book turned into a brain dead vampire movie aimed at teenagers. First of all it's based on half the story (the book before it in the series ""The Vampire Lestat"" ended with the beginning of ""Queen of the Damned"") They left out main characters, omitted the histories, and even changed how Lestat became a vampire, what was left out of ""Interview With The Vampire"" felt like they just needed to fit into some time constraints, what they did with ""Queen of the Damned"" was a hack and slash job. Even taking it separately from the book, it was at best mediocre. The characters were two dimensional, and bland, and the plot was boring and unconnected. This movie's only redeeming qualities were the mood the lighting and the sets added, and the costumes, which both were wonderful, but besides that, read the book instead.",2003
4,"Interview With The Vampire dealt with the anguish that goes hand in hand with becoming a vamp. In contrast, Queen Of The Damned panders to that goth/emo fantasy where it is really cool to be an immortal bloodsucker, likening it to the life of a rock star with millions of adoring fans. This approach mightn't be all that bad, if only Queen Of The Damned didn't do it all in such a lame and predictable manner.",2012
2,"I should have known when I heard Anne Rice left the project that the movie would disappoint me. I couldn't have predicted that years after it's release just thinking about the movie still makes me angry. The novels are amazing, and while I understand much gets lost in the translation to screen, this movie was a great big middle finger to her original work. I hope one day someone tries again, the right way, starting with The Vampire Lestat. They change the roles and looks of major and minor characters alike for no good reason. They destroy Lestat's history. The acting of the Queen is exaggerated to the point of comedy, but I just can't bring myself to laugh. The charm and allure of the novels just isn't there. The movie is a bad excuse to cram as many musicians and ""dark"" imagery as possible into one movie, hoping the teeny Goths of America would lap it up. Part of the appeal of the first movie, of Louis' story, is that he is caught between his humanity and his curse. Lestat is supposed to take over and display the magic and excitement of the vampire world. Thank goodness I read the books first, or I'd have never touched them after this movie.",2005
1,"WWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELL, let us see here. This might contain spoilers for anyone stupid enough to watch this.... movie? Let us start with the beginning. Lestat did not go ""to sleep"" in the 18th or 19th century and when he did he was still horribly wounded from being repeatedly stabbed, having his throat cut, being set on fire, and being thrown from a large tower. As I am a fan of the books this flick annoyed me so much I started shouting at the TV. As far as I know Lestat wasn't a fan of the goth genre. He was supposed to have risen in the 80s and was a ROCK star... not goth, not metal, not rap, but ROCK star, proper 80s rock. He wore denim and huge 80s sunglasses, rode a Harley Davison or a Porsche, which sadly got totalled but thats another story (that SHOULD have been in this movie). Thats the least of the flaws. As many here have stated, many characters and about 90% of the story and background has been cut out and probably sh*t on by the B-movie hacks responsible for this tripe. Even those characters that were wedged into the background were just nameless, funny looking freaks - i had to look up these people on the internet to find out who they were. The character of Armand looked more like Marius was supposed to look than the actual Marius character himself. AND, since when did Akasha have a semi Russian accent and an African heritage? The concert scene in the books was much more interesting than the awful spectacle in the movie. It was a nice touch that in a giant arena Lestat didn't need a microphone because of his powerful vampiric voice. Jesse was supposed to be severely injured at the concert too, having her spine smashed and it was Mael (the freaky old scarecrow guy in the movie) who turned her. Don't even get me started on the P!SS poor ending of this overzealous mtv ad because that was just a load of crapola!",2009
10,"I've seen this movie countes times now and still can't get sick of it.  It's like a frickin' drug.  I know a lot of people don't like it but there's something about it that just draws me in.  Every single performance is spectacular, but Aaliyah is the one who steals the show.  She not only played the role of Akasha she became it.  Her body movement and beauty was captured exceptionally well.  It's also nice to see that a black girl was chosen for the role of an Egyptian Queen (No, I'm not predjudice against white people, I am one).  True it's not known what color the ancient Egyptians really were but this was a nice change.  Stuart Townsend completely made me forget about Tom Cruise's portrayel of Lestat and Marguerite was striking once again.  All in all it was a good time at the movies.  For those who haven't seen it, be sure to watch it with an open mind and not take it too seriously.  I mean, it's a movie about a vampire who becomes a rock star.  Take it as that.",2002

From a purely film point of view there are a bunch of under-developed characters, plot holes, and it just doesn't make a whole lot of sense. It's not really surprising, since the director (Michael Rymer) has done nothing but 'B' movies, as have the two writers (Scott Abbott and Michael Petroni). I'm truly surprised that Anne Rice supposedly liked this film. If the screenplay had followed the book in any real way, the film would have been EPIC. No matter what the producers say on the official website, it could have been done right, as with The Vampire Lestat, if they had found the right writers and had actually wanted to work at it. But they were more interested in making a money maker, and so ended up with a movie on the threshold of 'B' movie, with a story that makes no sense, and actors that are only so-so. And some may say that the effects are cool, but I say they could have been a hell of a lot better. Especially given the fact that the film was made in 2002.",2005

So, obviously, a lot of the story was changed or left out. Which makes it understandable why some were upset. I mean, come on, Interview With the Vampire was over two hours long, and it was the movie version of just one book.",2004

In my opinion the only reason it did as well as it did in the theaters is because of all Aaliyah's fans who wanted to come see her last movie.  Take my advice stay as far away from this movie as you can get!",2003
1,"I went to see this movie opening night because for years I have been a big fan of the vampire chronicles.  I was expecting something along the lines of what they had done with the first movie, however, that was not the case. In fact, it seems to me, with this movie they did everything they could to distance themselves from the first.  The script for this movie was nothing but trash.  Some of the lines were so cheesy I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  The acting wasn't the best it could have been and a lot of the scenes were so awkward that I laughed at loud.  It didn't flow very well, and I'm not sure that someone who hadn't read the books would be able to identify the characters or have any idea of what was happening.  Though, I went with a good friend of mine who is also a big fan of the books, and even he had trouble trying to figure out who was supposed to be who because the characters we so drastically different from what they were supposed to look like.  They kept introducing new characters (which most they didn't even bother to name) before they had even developed the existing characters. They moved so fast that you weren't even really sure who you were supposed to side with.  I would advise hard core Anne Rice fans to stay away from the movie because it will only upset you.  Anyone who was going to see it because it was a ""sequel"" to ""Interview With the Vampire"" should avoid it because it was nothing like the first one.  Anyone going to see it because it's a new vampire movie shouldn't waste their time because it was more cheesy then the sequel to ""From Dusk Till Dawn."" I really wouldn't advise anyone to see this movie at all.  There is no need to waste your money on nonsense like this.  I'm just afraid that people will think this is what the books were like.",2002

Marius' character looks like he walked out of a 50's vampire B movie.

True, this is one of those ""Dude, where's my brain?"" movies. Sometimes you just need those though. The people I work with told me that this was a pretty stupid movie, and it is. But I think people shouldn't be in a serious mood for this movie. For an intelligent comedy or a good movie kind of day, no. This is not the movie for you, but if you need a meltdown after a hard day, then by all means give this movie a chance. It's really not that bad, and you get more than a few laughs.

10,"Finally, a movie that rivals The Breakfast Club for watchability! Wonderful script and great acting!  Jack Black is fun to watch and this script allows him to take full advantage of the zany character.  Go into watching this movie for the pure entertainment (read laughter) value -- after all that's what movies are for.",2003
1,"This flick confirmed many lingering suspicions, and none too pleasant:  1) Jack Black is a great comedic character actor who can easily be strangled by a poor script (he's at his best when he can bounce off of comedy writers like David Cross and Bob Odenkirk);  2)anything produced by MTV pictures is destined to suck;  3) an all-star cast (John Lithgow, Kevin Kline, Catherine O'Hara, Harold Ramis, Chevy Chase, Lily Tomlin) should be a signal that the material can't stand on its own.",2002
10,"I have seen the movie Orange County,brace your self,4 times!I saw it the day it came out,the next day(saturday),and the next day on Sunday twice!It may sound obsessive but I loved that movie.It has a great cast,plot,screenplay,characters,and outline.It stars my all time favorite actor the son of the wonderful Tom Hanks,Colin Hanks,also jack black,catherine o` hara,john lithgow,and schuyler fisk.It also has many camio`s by Ben Stiller,Kevin Kline,Chevy Chase,and lily tomlin.It is a light hearted movie with so many great laughs that will leave you on the floor and cracking-up.It does not have those gross jokes only one or two.The acting is very good and by the end of the movie you will love all the characters.I hope that you will enjoy this movie and not put in down like all the critics have.ORANGE COUNTY ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!",2002
6,"In my opinion, a movie comedy needs more than just an endless cast of characters who are such confirmed idiots that everything they say and do is either laughably stupid or so totally haywire that they never learn from the appalling results of their stupidity, but go on making the same blunders from first to last. Not only do they never wake up to themselves, the very few normal people they come into contact with, do virtually nothing to put them right. ",2017
2,What happens if you really want to leave your small town you grew up in for something bigger? That's the question that this film from 2002 asks.,2017
10,"I must say out of all the comedies I have ever seen in my life Orange County was by far the best one! I could not stop laughing the whole time, the acting in this movie is phenomenal I feel all the actors did such a great job on their part in the movie. The movie starts out with a young but very intelligent guy who is about to be a high school graduate but he doesn't care about school at this point nothing but hanging out with his friends and partying until Shaun discovers a book on the beach written by an author named Marcus Skinner that moves something deep inside him that encourages him to want to become this professional writer Shaun then makes it his mission to get into Stanford and to meet Marcus Skinner in person. Shaun has so many personal issues among his terrible dysfunctional family that causes so much chaos throughout the movie. His brother is played by the famous Jack black who is the person who truly makes the movie so interesting and funny. Shaun has a girlfriend that tries to help him along the way to get into Stanford but somehow terrible things keep happening but if you will stay tuned you will fall in love with this movie, it has great humor and it will be a movie that you will be talking about for years to come don't miss out on this one! I don't want to put any spoilers in here so there is a lot of detail left out but there is enough in here to show you what the main plot is in the movie, hope anyone that watches will enjoy.",2014
9,"How this movie has an average rating of 6.1 at the time of me writing this review is beyond me. The semi-serious base story of Shaun, a high schooler trying to get into Stanford is a good enough drama on its own, but then you ad the social commentary (albeit exaggerated...maybe)on the southern California mindset with an all star cast including Jack Black Lily Tomlin and Chevy Chase the movie becomes outrageously funny. I think Colin Hanks is an excellent actor (I have no idea why he has all but disappeared in the last 10 years), and does a bang up job of being the one kid in school who actually cares about his education all the while being pulled away by his numb-skull surfer buddies. Another of the cast who seems to have disappeared is Schuylar Fisk who plays Shaun's girlfriend Ashley. Ashley is the overly positive sweetheart girlfriend who will support Shaun through thick and thin. This is honestly one of Jack Black's funniest performances. He plays Shaun's druggie dead beat brother and when he gets mixed up in Shaun's quest for Stanford, hilarity compounds! Even 10 years after the movie was released I still laugh out loud watching this!",2012
8,"Where as this isn't an original Coming of Age story, ""Orange County"" brings about a dynamic story line, that transforms the classic Coming of Age tale, into a new breed that similar movies follow in it's footsteps such as ""Sex Drive"" and ""I Love You Beth Cooper"".",2011
1,"Orange County is a fine example of why nepotism can be dangerous. Colin Hanks has little discernible talent and the female lead, who I guess is Sissy Spacek's daughter, in neither attractive or a good actress. I rented this movie because I think Jack Black is hilarious. For this atrocity, though, he should be ashamed. The commercials for this movie were funnier than the actual movie. I can't think of one time during the entire film that I actually laughed. The cast was lame and the script was poorly written, which is ironic because it's a movie about a supposedly brilliant writer tying to get into Stanford. I don't know what college the writer of this film went to, but if i had to guess, it would probably have ""community"" somewhere in its name. If you want to see a good coming of age comedy, see Dazed and Confused.",2006
10,"Wow, this movie is really crazy...It's very sarcastic about many social issues.  If you don't get the joke then you might totally miss the points...the points of the jokes of course.  I like the way the scenes are shot.  Depending on emotional connotation of some particular scene the speed of different angels switches around in interesting patterns...Anywho, there aren't that many movies that I'm willing to watch out there, but this movie is one of my picks.",2003
8,"Denzel Washington continues to prove why he is one of the best actors in the business with his performance in JOHN Q, a moving, emotional, and tension-charged drama about a family man whose son needs a heart transplant; however, due to financial problems, his insurance won't cover the cost of getting his son on the donor list so John Q decides to take hostages in the hospital until someone arranges for his son to be on the donor list. Despite a preachy and simplistic screenplay, the intense direction and first-rate performances make this film work. I particularly loved Denzel's work here because this was a character unlike he had ever played before...Denzel usually played well-educated, intelligent lawyers and/or businessmen (with the obvious exception of TRAINING DAY), but here Denzel is playing an average Joe...a working stiff, struggling to pay bills and keep food on the table and a roof over his family's head who is driven to extreme measures to protect the family he cherishes so dearly. Washington gets strong support from Robert Duvall, solid as always as the hostage negotiator, James Woods as a wimpy surgeon, Anne Heche as an unsympathetic hospital administrator, and especially Kimberly Elise as John's wife. An emotional drama, wrought with tension, that will rivet you to the screen.",2005
10,"A very well cooked thriller, with every necessary ingredient, and a plot meant to surprise the viewer.",2008
10,"Denzel Washington's portrayal of a desperate dad is excellent and compelling as he struggles to find a way to get his son to be treated and operated immediately, no matter what cost. He takes the whole hospital hostage until he gets it. One may say what he is doing is bad and illegal, but at the same time he stands up to the system, and fights the odds, but hey, he's doing it for his son. I praised him when he said ""I don't want to bury my son, I want my son to bury me!"" In a way, he's willing to sacrifice himself to save his son. The hostages he takes, seems to support him and the mass of audiences viewing are on his side. And he also seems to be calm and friendly to them too. The ending was also perfect, and overall a great film, and not to mention the great performances from Robert Duvall, James Woods and Ray Liotta of The Good Fellas, who uses his Tommy Vercetti voice again! Gotta love that guy, gotta love that Denzel Washington, recommended for those who love him.",2004
8,"Despite what people have said, this movie is NOTHING like Dog Day Afternoon. The only similarities between the two is that both films have to do with holding a public place hostage (In Dog Day Afternoon it was a Bank in John Q, its a hospital).  Sure, you see a sort of homage to Dog Day Afternoon in John Q, but thats it, the movie has its own plot.  I enjoyed this film, Denzel Washington is really believeable as the down-on-his-luck father, and the rest of the supporting cast executed their characters very well.  Most notably the great Robert Duvall as the hostage negotiator and Ray Liotta as the stuck-up police chief.  I won't say more about this movie other than it is heart-breaking and you can almost feel the pain frustration John Q has to go through.  4 stars out of 5.",2002
9,"Once again Denzel Washington has outdone himself in this delightful movie. I am getting spoiled when ever I go to see one of his pictures, as his depth is constantly great.  Mr. Casavettes does a fine directing job in this poinient story, but with bits of humor thrown in to break up the tension. This may not be academy award material, but it certainly is worth the price of a ticket.  Go see it, you won't regret it.",2002
8,"In this movie, with a great acting of Denzel Washington as John Q. I felt the deep problems of health in the USA. My cousin lives in the United States (i don't), and she told me a few complaints about this problem; in the movie i finally understood about that. I don't understand how, the most powerful country in the world does have such bad health services to it's people?. For the benefit of the Americans, i hope that they change this system soon. Denzel puts his hearth on this movie, playing a normal guy with financial problems and a hard work; the way that Denzel shows his love to his son is remarkable and demonstrates why he is one of the actual best actors in Hollywood. If you have seen Searching for David's Hearth (2004), this is as the other side of the story.",2007
7,"John Q (Denzel Washington) is just an average man, he works at a factory and his wife and his son Michael are his whole world. When his son is taken ill and needs an needs an urgent heart transplant, he soon learns that his insurance won't cover the bills and he has no real hope of raising the cash himself. In an act of desperation he holds the emergency room hostage, it's all he can do to get his son the care he needs.",2007
10,"Denzel Washington, in my opinion, is the best actor in Hollywood. This movie is another example of his range and versatility. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. There were four points n the movie where I cried. I cried when the parents were told about Mike's heart, I cried when he talked to his on on the phone, I cried when he was saying goodbye, and I cried as he drove away. ",2009
7,"It's no secret that America has a health care crisis where about 50 million people are uninsured in this country. The story about John Q. is about his battle to save his son's life when the hospital and health insurance companies have failed his young son by declining to put his name on the heart transplant list. Two time Oscar Winner Denzel Washington does his best to bring life into this character that any other actor would not be able to do. Kimberly Elise is also admirable in her role as his wife. Anne Heche's performance as Rebecca Payne, the hospital administrator, is quite sickening because she plays the bureaucracy part of the role but she does it well. She can act as well. James Woods plays the rich, blood-sucking doctor who John Q. takes hostage along with other innocent bystanders and hospital staff but John Q. has a heart too. Ray Liotta and Robert Duvall have supporting roles as the police chief and hostage negotiator trying to get John Q. to end the standoff. The actions are understandable since a parent would do anything to save their child's life from known death.",2008

7,"This is now the second film that I have watched which focuses on Americas health care, or lack of it, I live in the UK where all our citizens get free health care no matter what there circumstances are, What have we come to in this world if money is greater than the sum of a human life, America and it's people should be ashamed of themselves to ever let this situation happen. The film shows this situation up very well, The acting was first rate and the film in the end is a very worthy effort. Denzil Washington does a fine job of showing how we all would feel if we were thrust into a nightmare situation that meant you could loose your child simply because you don't have enough money to pay the rip of prices of the blood sucking health system.",2009
1,"I remember hearing about this at the time it was made, and there was some praise for it tackling the topic of poorer people not receiving medical treatment and the dominance of Medical Insurance in the US. There were also two seemingly good factors about it, the first being Denzel Washinton and Nick Cassavetes. Yet it's taken until now to actually see the movie, and quite frankly, I wish I'd never wasted my time...that's an hour and a half I just won't get back.",2005
8,Denzel does a great job in this film. His performance was moving and made me cry. Just as he did in Man on Fire. The film itself isn't too bad. The music could of been better but they didn't do a bad job on it. It's Denzel's acting that makes the film however. If you are a Denzel fan and feel like watching a well performed and touching film... then get a box of tissues and sit down and watch 'John Q'. It isn't his best film but certainly another one of his well performed ones. This story is about a poor family and the poor health system in America. He loves his son dearly and will do anything for him. This is the tale about a man who will stop at nothing to try and save his son's life who needs a new heart and it truly is touching.,2009
7,"""John Q"" was the first movie with which I'm familiar that looked at the health care situation in this country. Too bad that it had so many inaccuracies. The plot of course has economically strapped John Quincy Archibald (Denzel Washington) taking a hospital hostage to demand medical treatment for his son.",2006
10,"This movie is ""off the hook""!  It made me laugh...it made me cry...and it actually enlightened me on a few social issues.  The entire cast did an outstanding job - especially Denzel!  Very, very nice DW. I'll be counting the Oscars for this one!",2002
1,"This movie, from the first 10 minutes, attempts to make a deep and philosophical commentary on the United States' poor health care system.  The problem is that instead of making these points with plot, actions, and emotions, the viewers are beaten over the head with obvious dialogue that sounds completely contrived.  In addition, the messages that the movie tries to pass as revolutionary are infact incredibly old and are insultingly simplified to anyone with a high school education or better!  In short, the movie attempts to be deep and comes up extremely short (somewhere between insulting and retarded).  One final note, on top of my previous complaints the movie is also horribly acted (with the exception of Denzel) and has a ridiculous number of side plots that are also contrived and never go anywhere.  Overall, a corny pile of steaming poo!",2002

On the downside, the film is the usual romcom fare with nothing in particular to distinguish it from a panoply of peers. On the up side, the flick is chock full of Lawrence's humor which made ""Miss Congeniality"" and ""Forces of Nature"" so enjoyable. Entertaining stuff worth a look for Bullock or Grant fans and romcom junkies. (B-)",2003

10,"I read with amusement the comments of others. I bought this movie on DVD and have got it in my normal rotation (along with others I like). I thought that the pairing of Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock worked very well. I did not enjoy this movie for it's social significance, that's not what I watch movies for. If you enjoy adult humor and can appreciate the nuances then you will find this quite enjoyable. It is Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant at their best. Some of my favorite scenes include the one where Sandra Bullock has eaten too much and has to go to the bathroom while they are stuck on a bridge in New York City. Adding the music ""Taking Care Of Business"" was really a stroke of genius. The ""Bobcat Pretzel"" scene was equally funny. The interjection of the appropriate music adds much to the results.",2004
6,"Lucy Kelson {Sandra Bullock} lands a job as chief counsel for a big hitting New York real estate firm that is owned by mega-rich George Wade {Hugh Grant}. He's an engaging enough boss but he's very shallow, and Lucy finds that she's practically running his life for him. So finally tiring of being treated like a Personal Assistant, she gives her two weeks notice of resignation. But can the pair do with out each other? And is there more than a working relationship bubbling under the surface? For his first feature film directing assignment, Marc Lawrence played it safe and got lucky with his lead actors. Whilst hardly setting a new benchmark in the ROM-COM genre, Two Weeks Notice is however witty and not without charm. This is due in the main to the pairing of Grant & Bullock, who play it perky and spark a chemistry so sadly lacking in many other modern day films of its ilk. By their own admission the pair got on great off screen, and that is evident as the pair feed of each other to make the lightweight script work wonders. The dominance of the pair tho leaves little room for the supporting actors to breathe, with many of them coming across as mere fillers. It's this that stops the film from being the great film that Bullock, and particularly Grant's, efforts deserved.",2010
10,"Writer and first time Director, Marc Lawrence's ""Two Weeks Notice"" is a charming, smart, and genuinely funny romantic comedy with terrific performances by Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant.  This a great movie. Inherent in romantic comedies is a degree of predictibility.  ""Two Weeks Notice"" follows formula, but Lawrence orchestrates enough curves, character insight, and human resonance to make it more than just formula. He also has the great chemistry of Bullock and Grant-- this is their medium.",2003

The film juxtaposes between the sugary sweet that it lacks quality to keep me enthralled the whole way through. And after its through you just forget about it without really giving much to comment about after you've watched it. The other unbalanced factor is that it has a great opening scene that has a potential to be something special only to get cheated out turning this lightweight film to a featherweight slug. ",2014

3,"From the title, I assumed this film was something to do with getting married or something, i.e. the amount of time before the ceremony, but it isn't that at all, it was only from the the two leads I wanted to see it in the first place, from Miss Congeniality writer Marc Lawrence. Basically liberal lawyer Lucy Kelson (Sandra Bullock, also producing) works in New York City in environmental law, and her work contrasts with that of immature billionaire real estate tycoon George Wade (Hugh Grant) who owns a lot but does not know a lot. Trying to stop the destruction of Coney Island community centre, which she knew in her childhood, Lucy gets to meet George, and he is looking for a new Chief Counsel to replace his old one Amber, but she says she will still keep an eye on the centre if she accepts the job, which she does. Soon enough she realises that this job is more as an aide, and even the smallest thing he will call her about, even in the middle of the night, and it getting her increasingly annoyed, and she gives him her two week notice that she will be quitting, this is after he has an ""emergency"" choosing a suit for a friend's wedding. George tries to convince Lucy to stay as he feels like he really needs her, and he makes sure that any other jobs she tries to get she doesn't, until he finally gives up and brings in flirty June Carver (Alicia Witt) to be trained and replace her. Lucy left, even after becoming jealous of the new girl, and George actually keeps the promise he presumably made to not destroy the community centre, and obviously she misses him terribly. In the end there is a bit of a petty argument between them because of their obvious differences of opinion and stuff, but in the end they realise they have feelings for each other, and George and Lucy finally kiss. Also starring Dana Ivey as Ruth Kelson, Robert Klein as Larry Kelson, Heather Burns as Meryl Brooks, Four Weddings and a Funeral's David Haig as Howard Wade, Dorian Missick as Tony, Donald Trump and ""Sunrise"" singer Norah Jones. Grant does his usual English twit thing, and Bullock plays her usual feisty and attractive character, together they aren't really very convincing, the entire film doesn't really convince you that there is any love story at all, the material is boring, at times ridiculous, and mostly unfunny, a bit of a pointless romantic comedy. Adequate!",2012
7,"Hugh Grant stopped doing actual romantic comedies after he did the great film Notting Hill. He still does do Romantic comedies, but they're not so romantic. Like Music & Lyrics. A film that I love... I wrote a review for it and said Not quite romantic, but funny as hell. Because that's what that film is. Two Weeks notice is the same way, but this film isn't as good as Music & Lyrics. It's not too far, but it's not quite as good. There's not much wrong with Two Weeks notice. I don't believe that Sandra Bullock's Lucy Kelson character would go out with Hugh Grant's George Wade character. I'm not quite sure if there is much chemistry between the two of them. I do think the two of them worked well, but it didn't really seem like they were that in love. it seems like i'm bashing Two Weeks notice. But that's far from what i'm doing. I was just naming the mistakes. Two Weeks notice does work for a few reasons. Both Grant and Bullock are good together. Also, the film is pretty funny. Mostly thanks to Hugh Grant's character, the usual, of course. Grant is one of my favorite actors. Bullock is one of my favorite actresses. Together, the film is a success.",2009
6,"A by-the-numbers romcom is made better than average by Hugh Grant's impeccable timing and delivery. When Sandra Bullock is snoring her head off, he puts a pillow under her head to stop her. Instead, the snoring gets louder.""Opposite effect. Interesting,"" says Grant. The line is only funny because Hugh Grant says it. He has perfected the little-boy-lost routine to a tee. Bullock does fine, and the character actors support the main players well, particularly the overweight not-pregnant-but-then-is colleague of Bullock's, who gets the best squirming out of Grant. But the whole film lives or dies on the casting of Grant, it is impossible to think of these lines working said by any other actor.

I found it almost unwatchable, extremely unfunny, and after suffering through an hour, gave up on it and walked out. In general I think Hugh Grant is extremely talented and usually very funny, but he was not given anything to work with in this poor apology of a movie. Sandra Bullock should get over herself and stop playing these parts where we're supposed to believe she's unattractive to the opposite sex in her eyes. Come off it, Sandra, you know you're too good-looking to get away with it, you're no Nia Vardolos (Big Fat Greek Wedding) - in fact I believe the suits wanted to shoehorn Bullock into the Greek-girl role but thank the gods they were foiled.",2002

George proposes Lucy to be the attorney of his Company, and he would preserve such a beautiful and important building without demolishing. After a period working together, George becomes completely dependent of Lucy, so she decides to quit her job. The rest of the plot is so silly and predictable that does not worth any comment. This movie only works because of the central pair of stars: Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant are wonderful in their roles and in the end the viewer will not be completely disappointed and the movie will entertain.

4,"I'll admit I've only watched a handful of episodes, but each one seemed completely different from the next. It seems after the first season, the producers decided to completely retool the show, drop characters, introduce new ones, and rewrite the entire show dynamic.",2009
8,"What i like about you is one of those series you need to see but aren't sure you would see, the beginning is cool and its sucks you into the series just for fun, the second part i season 2-3 which are more stale, they come and go in what you want. what happens with many series is that they don't end with something special because the second part of the series always goes down into the drain, this one also somewhat did, the third part is the one to spoil and ruin the whole series, usually, but it doesn't, this ending is perfect for the series, it fits perfect, actually i was pretty angry about all these guys in Val's life, actually i wanted to end with Jeff in the end, but later on it changed, they chose to take Vic into the series after almost 3 seasons without him, and that was the biggest surprise and also what made the series go on top.",2009
10,"The show is about two sisters living together. Holly being the younger one has some teenage problems on the other hand her sister Val has job,boy friend,fiancé problems like most of the women on the planet. They try to support each other they make mistakes sometimes but they don't give up and continue. And the show is also about friendship. The priorities in life. I loved this show so much. It is funny and the actors are so good. I am really sad that the show is over. I still watch the reruns time to time:) Amanda Bynes is very talented. Jenny Garth may be new to comedy but she plays really well. She is one of the actresses i like watching. I like Vince and Holly's relationship they are very natural. Gary is a natural talent and makes you laugh each time he shows up. With Tina Holly found a real friend and i really like them hanging out. Lauren character is so funny and she is a natural talent. I would like to see her more. This show really takes you in and makes you laugh. I wish the show hasn't been over.",2008
9,"'What I Like About You' is definitely a show that I couldn't wait to see each day. Amanda Bynes is such an excellent actress and I grew up watching her show: 'The Amanda Show.' She's a very funny person and seems to be down to earth. ""Holly"" is such a like-able person and has an ""out-there"" personality. I enjoyed how she always seemed to turn things around and upside down, so she messed herself up at times. But that's what made the show so great.",2007
10,"My mom and I have just recently become addicted to this show, laughing our butts off! I've only seen about 10 episodes, and I am disappointed that I didn't pay attention to this hilarious series before they were canceled! The story line is very funny, the characters really have great personalities (or, not so great, but they're still funny!). I TiVO every episode of What I Like About You. Amanda Bynes and Jennie Garth, as well as all of the cast, never leave me bored while watching! There is some unsuitable language for children and some sexual content, but with a parental guide near, you shouldn't have too much problems. There is some sort of 'Friends' type of relationship that attracts me to this show. I really enjoy it.",2007
10,"I have just started watching the TV series ""What I like About You"" and I must say that is a joy to watch. I always like to see new shows do well considering a lot of shows go off before you really get a feel for them. I have watched Amanda Bynes since ""All That"" she is truly a funny girl, what is the best about her comedy is that its so natural and what i mean about that is, its something that a person could here there best friend saying, its not rehearsed.",2006
9,"Ali G earned his fame on the small screen - though the big screen has not lost him any kudos either. Ali G Indahouse is a hilarious laugh-a-second fun fest - just like on the small screen. He has lost none of his character or stupidity at all, and behind all that - none of the film is brainless fluff either. A human side to Ali is revealed during the film, the idea of Ali G running for PM is a brilliant, fresh and funny one - and the incessant stupidity of Staines' gangster man is mixed well with the stern, harsh world that is politics. The film is also full of brilliant new characters - and instead of just interview after interview, we get a proper comedy film that never gets repetitive or boring. So why didn't I give it ten stars? Well, the ending was funny, but also botched and failed - none of it made sense. And in parts, the film became offensive in trying to be funny - but that's Ali G for you - if it isn't offensive, it isn't itself, and it is totally and utterly ruined. Ali G's big screen debut was a success in my belief, and should have got into the 6-7 average rating range on IMDb. But it could have got worse as well, and people are bound to have mixed opinions, especially on a film such as this.",2006
8,"Ali G Indahouse has got to be one of the funniest films I've seen in a long time, and Cohen's portrayal of a British gangsta is hilarious. This film has cult classic written all over it, and it features some really great lines. Ali G Indahouse is a good-time party movie that will leave the viewer laughing literally from beginning to end. Definitely Vote Ali G and keep it real.",2003
8,"Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius. And this movie is good! Although the film doesn't nearly reach the quality of the tv-show, it's still very funny and has some seriously wicked moments! I've liked Ali G since the first time I saw the material from the show. I think he's one of the best comedy characters of all time.. up there with say, Peter Dragon (""Action"") and The Blues Brothers. Biggest surprise with this film was that they've actually got some serious actors to do it (Dance and Gambon). After this I will absolutely respect them even more, for having the good sense to take this chance. I have nothing really bad to say about this film, it's very funny. Very juvenile, but hey, so what?! ",2003
10,The thing with Ali G is that he takes the mick out of himself and his character. ,2004
8,"As someone who usually despises Ali G, Ali G Indahouse was absolutely brilliant. When I was watching it, I was in a hysterical fit. Yes it is sexist, rude and extremely crude, and I loved it. As some comedies are only have one or two comical scenes, this movie was laugh-a-thon. I have never seen a comedy as original as Ali G Indahouse.For a comedy starring Ali G, this would be worthy of an 8 out 10. Absolutely Brilliant.",2003
6,"When most British TV comedies get given the big screen treatment they are usually terrible. This is one of the more successful attempts but is still no where near as funny as when Ali G was the telly. Ali G was hilarious on TV when he was interviewing unsuspecting politicians/scientists/vicars etc, and less so here in this cinematic adventure. It actually has a plot as Ali rises to become Primeminister of Great Britain! It has some very funny parts but not nearly enough of them, maybe its because Ali G has been around for about 3 years now and the concept is becoming a bit stale now. Although I loved the bit where Ali met Sacha's other comic creation ""Borat"", very clever and a nice pay off for fans of his TV show. ***6/10)***",2002
6,I used to love Sacha Baron Cohen`s creation of Ali G on THE 11 0`CLOCK SHOW in the late 90s . I also liked the spin off show though it should be pointed out by then the joke was wearing thin and it was obvious his guests were in on the joke of having a white boy impersonating a black ghetto boy wannabe . When ALI G INDAHOUSE was released I didn`t bother to see it because Ali was probably past his sell by date then . But my brother bought me the video of this film and watched it on Boxing day and I must confess it was a lot better than I expected ,2003
6,"If you are a fan of smooth, hip talking or just a bit of hip hop, then you'll like this film, as for everyone else, you can enjoy Sacha Baron Cohen as the great Ali G. Borat (Cohen) also appears, but his own film is much better. Basically, Ali G lives in the West Side of Staines and is protesting about his Leisure Centre closing down. So he decides to join the Prime Minister (Sir Michael Gambon) and his nasty assistant David Carlton (Charles Dance) in parliament, hence the title, Indahouse. Also starring Kellie Bright as ""me"" Julie, Martin Freeman as Ricky C, the fit Rhona Mitra as Kate Hedges, Tony Way as Dave, EastEnders' Nabil Elouhabi as Jezzy F and Ray Panthaki as Hassan B, Naomi Campbell, newsreader Jon Snow, EastEnders' Rudolph Walker as President Mwepu, and Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan. Ali G was number 8 on The 100 Greatest TV Characters, he was number 6 on The 100 Greatest Funny Moments, along with Borat at number 24 (and Bruno at number 77), and he was number 6 on The World's Greatest Comedy Characters, with Borat at number 17, and Sacha Baron Cohen (or as the character) was number 12 on Britain's Favourite Comedian. Good!",2005
6,This is actually a quite lame comedy with some extremely childish humor but it all still somewhat works out due to the presence of the legendary Ali G character in it all.,2008
1,"As a fan of ""Da Ali G Show"" on HBO, I had high hopes for this film. I should have known better when it went straight to video.... and then none of my local video stores carried it! The problem with this film is it simply tries too hard. I did not not want to see the Ali G character in his home environment or running for parliament or saving England. In my opinion, the ""Ali G"" character only works when he is operating OUTSIDE his environment --- so we can laugh at how unbelievably stupid he is and laugh even harder at the frustrated, often angry reaction his sincere stupidity arouses in all those unfortunate to encounter him. This movie bombs horribly due to the throwaway script, and as a result, it is an interminable exercise in sheer boredom with maybe 3-4 genuine laughs to be had in TOTAL. I well and truly HATED it from frame one and it just NEVER got any better (despite crossing my fingers and gritting my teeth). I think Sascha Baron Cohen has talent (his TV show proves it), but this movie shows absolutely NONE of that talent.",2004
1,My god how bad this is. Who is this impostor pretending to be Ali G? Avoid this at all costs. It replaces the smart multi-layered satire and humour of his show with down and out toilet humour.,2003
4,"I have to admit that I love ""Da Ali G Show"" and purchased the first season as soon as it came out on DVD. So when I heard Sacha's movie was being released on DVD as well I wanted to rent it right away. One could say I had very high expectations as he is an extremely funny comedian so it was to my dismay that when it came time to actually watching the film it was complete and utter crap (for lack of a better term). I laughed probably 3-4 times tops throughout the whole duration which is pretty pathetic considering the main actor's potential. I mean I was well aware that it obviously didn't have a stellar budget but it still had so much more potential that it just couldn't live up to I guess. I was even more disappointed when I came to the realization that Mr. Cohen was actually one of the co-writers of this piece of garbage too because if he didn't help pen it then he could be considered less liable but once again to my chagrin...not in this case. I have seen a lot worse and I'm thinking I'm only being so hard on it since I went in with such high hopes but there are a handful of laughs, however don't act surprised when you find out it's nowhere near as funny as his TV show!",2004

10,"Being American, I have not been exposed to this character before, which is good because some of you have been disappointed. I have nothing to compare it to. I have found no enjoyment in the mindless idiot humor in the American teen movies, and although this is a slightly similar type  of humor, I couldn't stop laughing. I hardly ever laugh out loud at a movie. And usually a movie has a few funny parts for me, but this movie was funny from start to finish. My only disappointment was when it was over. I'm actually going to buy this on DVD when I find it.",2002
3,"For some reason Sasha Baron Cohen delivers an incredible performance in TV shows that make you laugh. Yet, the moment the same story goes to the big screen it becomes almost idiotic. Ali G Indahouse is the first of those attempts and the weakest of them all, preceding Borat and Brüno.",2015
4,"Well alongside his fame and fortune Sacha Baron Cohen has also managed to achieve such a high level of notoriety with his urban character, that the actual town of Staines changed its name to Staines-upon-Thames to get away from the negativity.

10,"i went to see this movie solely because i thought it would be horrible.  It looked so cornballish that i couldn't help but go if only to mock it from my seat the whole way through.  I was thus quite shocked to find myself actually enjoying the film!  From the direction, to the action, the camera work and especially the surfing shots, it was just amazing.  Seeing the waves crashing fifteen feet tall, it is definitely worth seeing in theaters to get the full effect.  Another shock came in the form of teh script, and the acting.  While they had their holes, it was amazing how real the movie felt.  They weren't actors, they were real people.  From the very beginning, it starts.  Other reviews have claimed that these characters were all standard hollywood barbies, but this is far from the truth.  While it Anne Marie is quite attractive she is far from movie star beautiful, there is this natural and real quality to her that, if anything, makes her all the more endearing.  i could drivel on, but the point is, this movie just makes you feel good.  it takes you along on this enjoyable ride, and leaves you with a positive attitude and an insatiable desire to move to hawaii, rent a shack and spend your days surfing.  It was cute, but there's also a lot of substance there.  definitely worth seeing.",2002
5,"From the thoroughly mediocre school of filmmaking, here comes director John Stockwell's 'Blue Crush'. Its graduates...uh, actors include Kate Bosworth, Michelle Rodriguez, and a bunch of other pretty people you've never heard of. Bosworth is Anne Marie, the super-talented surfer with a confidence problem. Before the movie is half over, she's in love with a pro quarterback and struggling to gumption up for the big all-girls surf championship. It's your standard 1980's Tom Cruise picture.",2004
10,"I should start off saying, This film is amazing on So many levels!!! the story is believable and well plotted, and the way this film was shot is Amazing!!!",2002
8,"I won't dispute the weakness in the story and some so-so acting. In this particular case I rate this movie highly for its video and especially audio quality. For any home theater fanatic looking for top notch sound this is one of the best. When they're out in the water laying pipe, etc... its about as good a sound track as I've heard. You can almost feel the water getting in your ears. The video isn't far behind but that was easier for the filmmakers since the Hawaiian coast is so beautiful. I found the story to be passable, but there are a couple of segments that are dumb and I skip over on repeat viewings. Some of the extra features on the DVD are also good. If you have a good HT audio setup this needs to be in your collection!",2004
6,"In Hawaii, Anne Marie Chadwick (Kate Bosworth) is a local surfer girl, who had an accident three years ago when she was on the top of her career. She almost died in a huge wave, but now she is preparing for an international competition, with the support of the best friends Eden (Michelle Rodriguez) and Lena (Sanoe Lake), and her younger sister Penny Chadwick (Mika Boorem). Anne is traumatized with her accident, and is quite afraid of the big waves, but she aims to achieve a sponsor to follow her career and have the necessary financial support. Some days before the competition, she has a crush on the football player Matt Tollman (Matthew Davis). 'Blue Crush' is a good popcorn film, having a shallow story but compensated by the wonderful places and the big waves in Hawaii, and the very beautiful young cast. An excellent entertainment for a Saturday or Sunday afternoon for the whole family. My vote is six.",2004
6,"Blue Crush does have the grace to get two things right- David Hennings (Very Bad Things) on photography greatly captures the surfing sequences, inparticular the beginning ones that give off a colorful, vibrant feel, and also the girls in the movie have a realistic attitude on life, if realism for you is girls who are on Hawaii surfing in their free time.  While too much of the injected skag of usual turns and characters are found in Blue Crush, not to mention the always important climactic contest (can a sports film not lead to a major contest in the end?) and (spoiler) picture of the winner on the cover of surfing magazine, while all that is there, there is an audience for Blue Crush, and they ride that wave out.

5,"A feel good chick surfer movie. The bad kind. Need I say more. Maybe. Sexy lead actresses, some incredibly nice underwater shots and shots of waves, not much of a story, a lame surf-stylewannabe soundtrack, but still, there's an idea as to what a surfer's life should look like, except here it (with little surprise) all about being number one and getting rich and famous. In between there's some unnecessary comic relief and a love story if you believe that's what it is.",2004
10,"This is a great movie! The surfing scene's are brilliant! Everything is perfect! Even the house and car made me feel all warm inside! We're actually thinking about moving to Hawaii thanks to this movie. There are some stupid mistakes in this movie. I'm a big fan of Michelle Rodriquez, but don't let her play in a surf movie if she can't surf... When she's surfing you can't see her face or you only see her back... so that's kind of pathetic... But this movie is funny, romantic, exciting, active and so much more! In one word: Great! I really don't understand why there are so many people who don't like this movie... It's really great! If it's a hot summer night and you're with you boyfriends/girlfriend you should definitely watch this movie!",2006
1,"What a horribly lame movie this is.  First, the bad acting almost makes it a comedy...almost!  Second, the plot...what plot?  It's as if someone just through all these self proclaimed actors together and just started filming! And third, I can't imagine what some of these reviewers are referring to when they describe cinematography and sound.  It's mediocre at best.  I was laughing through most of this movie watching the actors struggling at their attempt at creating drama.  It's one of those films that is so bad that you can't help watching it.  An unintentional comedy!  I get the feeling this movie was just a vehicle to parade a lot of T & A across the screen.  So, if you have the sexual maturity level of a junior high school student or have an IQ of 60 or lower (or both) you'll probably enjoy this.  Otherwise, forget this bomb.  I can only think of about ten thousand movies that would be more entertaining!",2003

My god, I can't even remember the characters' names and the storyline (what little storyline it has) I just can't find, maybe if I had it on DVD, I could read what it is about, but so far it has been a movie about chicks and surfboards and some nature scenery, that's it!

Yeh Blue crush is the best movie ever!! it is great how they cover the female perspective of surfing. I think they do a brilliant job. I also like how not everything is perfect, it's definitely a true surfer movie. Like the girls lacking in money and there not so perfect world. It's good that the movie is set in a beautiful location with beautiful sunny weather. But thats Hawaii for you not Some perfect Hollywood film. The movie is real and not some perfect ,polished movie. The chicks in the movie seem real as do the locations. It's great how they have done this. My favourite movie character in Blue Crush would have to be Anne Marie. She is passionate surfer and reminds me quite of my friend.I also like how her character goes through that stage of ""i don't care anymore"" It's really nice to watch like a feel good movie.

10,"I liked this movie a lot.  The animation was well done and the romance was cute.  I liked most of Bryan Adams' songs and the Hans Zimmer score was excellent.  What a lot of people don't realize is how well it relates to the Heart of Darkness/Apocalypse Now themes (what happens when so-called ""civilization"" invades someone elses home, what does it mean to be ""civilized"" etc.). The opening scenery and music were very stirring. The film is a lament to an America that was once beautiful.",2003

First of all I enjoyed the soundtrack (Bryan Adams), it really goes with the movie. Second the simple story, and the drama of Spirit gets your attention. One thing I like the most is that they didn't give the stallion a human voice to interact with the other horses, it makes the movie more realistic, not many animations seem realistic now do they ?, but... I don't know, making animals talk is just so... lame.",2004

Those who gave negative reviews would probably think that `Vanishing Point' was just another car chase movie and `Thelma & Louise' was just another chick flick.  Although the conclusions of those films are darker I feel the themes are somewhat related; that freedom and individualism are very important and that there is usually someone wanting to take it away from you.  The other common trait of these movies is the caring, thoughtful `guardian angel' types who help the main characters to overcome adversity.",2003
10,"I thought this movie would be dumb, but I really liked it. People I know hate it because Spirit was the only horse that talked. Well, so what? The songs were good, and the horses didn't need to talk to seem human. I wouldn't care to own the movie, and I would love to see it again. 8/10",2002

It was a refreshing break from the normal smash and explosion of the modern movie world, and I found it particularly interesting that the animals although intelligent didn't talk the narrator did that,  (the narrator supposedly being Spirit reflecting back on his life)  All in All a good, no Very Good Family Film. I hope we will see more like it.",2002

It only means white men had a kind of barbarian behavior to animals while native Indians had to learn how to live together with them. There's nothing depicted in this movie white men did not do with horses. Okay, is it stereotypical? Yes, in a level, yes, but come on, this is a movie, this is an animated movie, aimed mostly for kids; world is more black&white for them than this movie shows. By the way, the colors of the movie are incredibly beautiful; just as the pictures. Maybe not always really interesting pictures but lovingly beautiful. And the action scenes are better than any in the last two episodes of Star Wars (I had the same opinion about Tarzan after The Phantom Menace). That train sequence... And when ****spoilers*** before the very final scene, Spirit is aimed by guns but is not shot, you can see this movie isn't half as stereotypical about white men as you thought. If you still think it is, you have missed that scene. I personally am sad that this tale could reach only a smaller part of the movie-goers; this might mean that stupid (even if funny), poorly drawn animated features have future and ones like this do not. I certainly would love to see more of this type. 8/10. (p.s. Mustangs are really wild European horses...true)",2002
9,"There's no song and dance numbers, and the ponies don't break out into song whenever they're blue or lonely.  That's enough to rate this film very highly.  The storyline has a lot of symbolism in it, from the captivity of Spirit as well as that of the other horses, and the 'lessons' the movie tries to teach us in the bad guy vs the good guy, the bad guy being Army, and the good guy being Lakota.    You'll like the movie.  It'll make you think, and your kids will adore it.",2002
8,"It is not easy to create a animated movie in which the animals can display human feelings without losing his animal nature and will be understand by the younger audience at the same time. I have only seen three feature films, in which the idea, to tell a story only through the eyes of animals without ""cartoonize"" them too much, really works: ""Bambi"", ""Watership Down"", and ""Spirit - Stallion of the cimarron"". This movie is very underrated, it contains all the spirit (oops, good play with words ;-) that once was the realm of Walt Disney. Unfortunately modern Disney lost the ability to tell a good, straight, and heartwarming story in great pictures and symphonic music, like ""Spirit - Stallion of the cimarron"" do today. Unfortunately modern Disney films needing a lot of action, running gags and sidekicks to cover the weak and soulless plots. Without doubts, the primary model for ""Spirit - Stallion of the cimarron"" was Disney's old masterpiece ""Bambi"". As a great fan of ""Bambi"", i recognize more than a dozen references to Disney's greatest movie of all time: The opening sequence with the forest, Spirits birth, the fight with the cougar, the look to man's camp far away, the burning forest and the jump into the river, the final reunion... and a lot more. That's not wrong, because the makers of ""Spirit"" use this lovely references in its own context and add a lot more to bring us a great movie that will really touch you. I give him 8 out of 10 stars!",2005
10,"Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley Kubrick decided to make the 'proverbial good sci-fi movie' when they jointly created the film and novel 2001: A Space Odyssey. There have been few comparably good sci-fi films since. Solaris is, however, one of them.",2006
9,"My two favorite examples of Hollywood utterly destroying GREAT foreign films are Vanilla Sky and City of Angels, which were abominations of two of my favorite films - Open Your Eyes and Wings of Desire. If you've seen Tarkovsky's brilliant ""Solyaris"" this film will seem more like an Americanized tribute than a Hollywoodization of a great piece of Soviet cinema. Some will likely ask why Soderbergh bothered to make this film if he couldn't improve on the original. Personally, I could not care less. This is a great film, and shows that it is possible for Americans to remake classic non-American films sensitively, intelligently and well.",2005
9,"First off, if you are looking for shoot 'em up, space ship flying through the stars, hunting aliens type of science fiction, don't even bother with this film.

2,"Reading the reviews of this movie, I cannot help but recall a short comedy clip which I saw somewhere. It featured a modern art gallery, full of well-dressed high-class people, walking around and commenting on various wacky paintings, until the camera pans over to several elderly men surrounding another example of art on another wall. They point at it, comment how surrealistic it is, how the author managed to capture this and that, how perfect and how brilliant it is - until the ""painting"" begins moving, and drives off, it being just a piece of a soft drink advert pinned to the side of a truck that was parked outside a gallery window.",2003
1,"The first five minutes of this film are so torpid and dull, you just know you're in for something.  You're hoping it's a set-up to pull the rug out from under you when you least expect it.  Sadly, there is no rug; the rest of the movie remains at this underwater pace all the way to its unsatisfying and hokey ending.",2002
2,"I did not walk into the movie theater with very high hopes for this film as Andrei Tarkovsky's version of Stanislaw Lem's 1961 novel ""Solyaris"" is one of my all-time favorite films. However, I was not prepared for how incredibly banal Soderbergh's version turned out to be. This film is, quite frankly, a BOMB.",2002
4,NOTE: Spoilers for Solyaris too.,2009
1,"do they really read the book ? The movie shows us only 2 pages from original book of Stanislaw Lem. Only 2 pages describes the love story, but Soderbergh decided to make the whole movie based on it. Why ? Where is the real sense of Solaris from Stanislaw Lem ?  Where is Drama and Sci-Fi ? it is only cheap Romance. I'm quite sure he never read the book. I was forced to stop the movie after 34 minutes. I would like to give -1 point to it, but, unfortunately the minimum is 1. My suggestion - watch the movie ""Solyaris"" from Andrei Tarkovsky (10 points).",2003
9,"I rented this film, then did some last minute Christmas shopping. While I was gone, my husband watched the first half of ""Solaris"" and turned it off - twice. He then watched ""Terminator 3,"" which he enjoyed.",2003

5,"I'm sorry, I give Soderbergh all the credit in the world for his consistently original career moves, but I just can't like this movie.  I think a major problem with cerebral cinema is that it's easy to slip over the line and confuse plodding with profound.  It's like you're trained to fawn over a ten second shot of Clooney staring into space like a hurt puppy dog, because obviously there's something amazingly profound you're supposed to be pondering at that moment.  His wife's dead, he misses her, and his slipping memories of her are skewed and inaccurate, I get it, I don't need to watch slowly-edited shaky cam flashbacks ad nauseam to realize that. This guy is a psychologist, and a good one at that?  His occupation loses all meaning as soon as he sets foot in the space station.  He might as well have been a construction worker.  ",2002
1,"Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, of course - but I am simply astonished that this film has received so many positive comments here. I have not read the novel on which the film is based and I have watched Tarkovsky's version twice (because it demands it), but by judging this 'Solaris' on its own merits, I think this version is simply a load of old plop. Here's why: this version concentrates almost entirely on the love story at its centre and to carry its ideas through successfully, the relationship at its core has to be believable - which it clearly isn't. There is simply no chemistry at all between the two leads; I've seen more sexual sparks created between Shaggy and Scooby. And whilst George Clooney is competent enough - he's certainly no Donatas Banionis. And the casting of Natasha McElhone is a complete disaster. Why that irritating smug grin throughout the film? A futile exercise in wasting everyone's time and money. Avoid.",2008
1,"One tag-line for this movie is ""There are some places man is not ready to go,"" like into the theatre playing this movie. The other tag-line is ""How far will you go for a second chance?"" Apparently as far as death by boredom.",2005
3,"I give this movie 3 stars for the serenity it depicts. It was kinda relaxed to watch it.i had an OK time while it was on my screen. But it never came close to the bestrangening and tranquilizing weirdness of Tarkovskys movie Solyaris.Which is an all time masterpiece. I had the impression that this one, the Soderbergh version was only made because American's in general are unable to bear the Tarkovsky movie.To strange and unpredictable for them. Thus said we see immediately that all the originality is left out of this Cloony- Solaris version.A meager love story...and never coming close to the esoterically bestranening appearances of the Wife in the Tarkovsky film.Somehow Soderbergh needed his film 'to make sense'. and that's the greatest failure in this very meager version of Lem's book & Tarkovsky's masterpiece. And music composed on Propellorhead software , also does'nt do the trick !",2008
5,"Having read the book before I saw this I though it was a huge disappointment. They completely missed the point of the story, which was philosophical rather than emotional. Basically, the movie took an awe-inspiring ""what if"" thought experiment - of finding a very advanced non-human intelligence (which, surprise surprise, doesn't have two arms, two legs, a body and a head) and the problems of trying to communicate with such a radically different being, especially when it doesn't seem interested in communication, and how we can relate to it with our own limited human experience, and squeezed out all the juicy intellectual bits. Solaris was supposed to be the real star of the story and the screenplay instead turned it into background wallpaper. All that was left then, was a sappy love story set in space. It is frustrating to think about the potential that was wasted. Mr. Soderbergh could have made a classic sci-fi film here, if only he'd made an honest attempt.",2008
7,"As a science fiction film, Solaris follows the same rule as the best of the genre, namely that it isn't the creatures or technology that makes the viewers want to watch, it is the human drama. Which is just as well, because the film itself is slower than the proverbial wet week, in spite of being less than a hundred minutes in length. Nonetheless, I will be very interested to see future projects from Steven Soderbergh.",2004
6,"SOLARIS, directed by Steven Soderbergh, and starring George Clooney, is one of those pointless remakes Hollywood has been making these past decades that adds almost nothing to the original classic. The movie itself is good. Not great or even close to being bad or a misfire, just good.  Soderbergh basically boiled down the complex and epic story, as seen in the Russian film, into a simple MINIMALISTIC love story. Which made me wonder why did they even bother remaking the movie if all the science-fiction and metaphysical elements were thrown out? The story could have easily taken place entirely on earth. And instead of Solaris, the story could have been set in a mystical setting, like a haunted castle or an ancient archeological find. If you're going to set in space, might as well give the outer space aspect some sort of meaning to it. The minimalistic approach is interesting but the result is pointless. Having Rheya come back from the dead, sort of speaking, and her problems adjusting to her new reality reminded me a lot of the replicants' plight in BLADE RUNNER, which is what I think Soderbergh tried to do here. Who's reality is it?",2003
6,"There are a number of good things about this movie, but ultimately it felt to me like a lost opportunity. It raised provocative psychological issues but never carried me away or led me to anything like an epiphany. In the latter half, I was in fact a bit bored. It certainly isn't enthralling like Tarkovsky's version. Rheya's character is better developed, particularly her own psychological trauma in being a ""creation"" (Tarkovsky's Rheya was something of a naif in comparison). But what I missed from Tarkovsky's version is the sense of humor (this one is stiflingly earnest) and the evocative and poignant use of Bach chorales in the soundtrack. The soundtrack to this one is intriguing (a la Brian Eno, Ligeti, and Thomas Newman's scores for The Player and American Beauty), but I eventually found myself desperately longing for a cadence. Lacking the feeling of redemption communicated musically in Tarkovsky's version, this one had to rely on ham-handed statements of fact. And finally, I can't help remarking that neither Tarkovsky nor Soderbergh really convey the element of shame and sexual deviance that played such an important part in Lem's original. Both place the emphasis instead on guilt, which isn't quite the same thing, is it?",2002
1,Some Scifi movies are classics. Some are Legends. This one just doesn't fit in anywhere. It tries so hard to be 2001 A Space Oddysey and falls so short its not funny.,2008
8,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Truly exceptional adaptation of Dickens really shows how terrific writing can allow a film to work.  Yes, the cast was very capable and in fact, Christopher Plummer was  multi-layered, pure evil as Uncle Ralph.  The Squeers team of veterans Jim Broadbent and Juliet Stevenson made escape from their ""school"" seem the only rational approach. Charlie Hunnam is gorgeous and capable as Nicholas, and herein lies the problem.  While not for the youngest of kids, those 12 and up would probably enjoy the movie very much.  As a way to touch Dickens, this is easily the least painful and most accessible for 7th through 12th graders.  Why aren't audience was filled with 40 and 50 somethings who read the novel growing up and a few (like me) brought teenagers with them.  My daughter and her friends loved it!  Very frustrating that studios will sink millions into drawing crowds for trash like ""Planet of the Apes"", ""XXX"", ""Blue Crush"", etc but almost nothing into this.  Of course, this offers an education in story structure and the supporting casting was inspired.  In addition to Hunnam, Anne Hathaway (""Princess Diaries""), Jamie Bell (""Billy Elliot""), Nathan Lane and Alan Cumming were all excellent.  Tom Courtenay was funny and pitiful at the same time.  Yes, the story is like much of Dickens, it provides hope for those who seem to have little.  Good prevails over evil.  Personally, I like that approach.",2003
10,"Stunning photography, outrageous characters and a powerful, emotional story: that's Nicholas Nickleby, the 2002 adaptation from the famous book by Charles Dickens. I have not read that book, so this story was new to me and I couldn't help but be impressed.",2007
8,"With his complex plots and casts of (often literally) hundreds of characters, Charles Dickens might not seem the most cinema-friendly of novelists, but as of January 2007 no fewer than 235 works are credited on the IMDb as being based on his works, all the way back to ""The Death of Nancy Sykes"" in 1897. In recent years, however, most of these have been multi-part series made for television, a medium which often seems better equipped to deal with Dickens's complexities than does the cinema. The most popular of his works in the cinema has been ""A Christmas Carol"", which is a novella rather than a novel, followed by ""Oliver Twist"" and ""Great Expectations"", both of which are among his shorter novels, and which are often simplified for the screen. Roman Polanski's recent ""Oliver Twist"", for example, omitted many of Dickens's details and sub-plots in order to concentrate on the essence of the story.",2007
8,Nicholas Nickleby by Charles Dickens is a rather complicated novel. To even try to put a dent on the narrative is a task for someone very ambitious indeed. The film treatment directed and written by Douglas McGrath tries to condense it. In many ways he has succeded.,2003
10,"Juliet Stevenson seems to be devoted acting as Mrs. Squeers. After her first appearance in the movie, I knew Mrs. Squeers was very odd, rude, and has her own way of dealing almost every matter. Mrs. Squeers is worse than Mr. Squeers, who Jim Broadbent acted as. Juliet made the character so realistic, which is practically needed for every character in every movie/TV show. I think it's just amazing how she and Jim Broadbent made the characters seem so real.",2007
7,"Having read the novel NN a couple of times I know how rich and full of funny characters and episodes this novel is. This adaptation greatly reduces the number of events compared to the novel; though I understand a director has to make a choice what elements of a story he should put to the screen I think the director has been a bit too drastic in doing so. No reference at all to the Mantalini's, or to the downfall of the Squeerses and the closure of Dotheboys hall -I sorely missed those episodes! But what I missed story-wise was partly made up by the acting of Christopher Plummer as Ralph Nickleby and the heartrending performance of Jamie ""Billie Elliot' Bell as Smike. A pity that the director also puts the accent mostly on the melodramatic aspects of a story which is full of delicious humor. This adaptation has it charms but check out the royal Shakespeare's Company's version for a faithful adaptation that does Dickens real justice!",2005
8,"""Nicholas Nickleby"" is a superb ensemble drama with each cast member holding his or her own.  But...Christopher Plummer is first amongst equals as his portrayal of the evil Uncle Ralph uncovers, layer by layer, a heart immune to love and a mind and will steeped in extravagant deceit and viciousness. Plummer's egotistic and malign speculator lacks, until the end of the story, the slightest insight into the depravity of his life.  But when realization ineluctably dawns, Plummer's intense acting blasts from the screen figuratively lowering the theater temperature with a gripping chill.",2003
10,"This adaptation of the novel proves to be both original and entertaining. Without losing any of the uniquely Dickensian spirit of the novel, this film version manages to create a new take on a Dickens classic. By having Vincent Crummles,a relatively minor character in the original, take center stage and become the narrator/presenter of the opening and closing scenes of the film, the director offers his own slant on Dickens's love of theatre and theatricallity. To that end, the choice to cast Dame Edna as Crummles's wife is a brilliant one.",2009
10,"""Nicholas Nickleby"" is the pluperfect Dickens novel. Dickens gives us a cross section of Victorian society--rich and poor, good and evil, comfortable and wretched.",2003
2,"I really disliked this movie, so much so I watched sometime last year and was so annoyed I couldn't sit down and write a review.",2006
4,"How this version could have received a score of 7.2 is almost beyond imagination - except that nowadays the young people have such crap to watch generally that they are perhaps incapable of judging properly! So they vote with their eyes for Charlie Hunnam and are impressed by the list of well-known actors who generally do a good job... and who all should hang their heads in shame for being part of this enterprise. Christopher Plummer is wooden, Jamie Bell is wasted in this as his character is barely developed, Mr Hunnam is woefully miscast as he doesn't have an ounce of credibility in any of his scenes. The only ones who come out of this without damage to their reputations are Tom Courtney, who plays his role believably at least, and the duo of Nathan Lane and Barrie Humphries (basically recreating his Dame Edna Everage personage)... these two succeed where everyone else fails because they are never to be taken seriously anyway, but are simply characters in the theatre of the absurd, and so fit in perfectly with the rest of this terribly terribly feeble attempt at bringing Dickens' characters to life.",2012
8,"I would have bet a multitude of nickels that the period comedy `Nicholas Nickelby' would not be worth a nickel. However, I must say that I was pleasantly surprised with this entertaining enchanting film based on the Dickens novel. Charlie Hunman stars as Nicholas, a determined British lad who suddenly becomes the caretaker of his impecunious family after his father's death. The supporting thespian work here is strong: the word has leaked that Christopher Plummer's role as the malevolent uncle who manipulates Nicholas and his family did not go down the drain; Jim Broadbent again bents all the rules of aesthetic acting by playing the vanity-challenged boarding schoolmaster with the scrupulous temperament that only Broadbent can deliver.  `Nicholas Nickelby's' clever screenplay and fluctuating direction came just in the nick of time to what might have seemed to be standard period comedy scenes.  `Nicholas Nickelby' is filled with surprises, spirit, and cheers. Isn't that what a St. Nick always seems to deliver? **** Good",2004
9,"In this day of intellectually devoid script writing where more effort is put into the special effects of explosions and the photo angle of the nude scenes, this picture focuses on an odd & almost forgotten concept; the telling of a story with a level of character development that inspires both love and hate in the audience. It is a movie with an adult theme with acting & dialog that does not depend on loud noises and car crashes to keep you interested. As a family show goes it could easily and safely be seen by children of all ages. Be prepared to grit your teeth and shed a tear while you hang on near every word spoken by these performers.",2005
9,"I love stories with heroes that display courage, honor, and virtue. I think, to some degree, that is also why I'm an Anglophile (a lover of period films). Back in the Victorian era, honor and virtue were everything. Authors like Charles Dickens understood this, and often made his heroes out to be hardworking, compassionate young men caught up in a world of evil, lies, and cruelty. Dickens also had a profound effect through his novels on the English school system; he forced authorities to take a closer look at orphanages and boys' boarding schools. He would love this film.",2003
2,"I have to agree with the comments made by anne2knunn and Edina van Daalen. This is a pretty unimpressive and woefully skeletonized adaptation of a wonderful story. Gone is the rich tapestry of Dickensian characters. Miss Snevilicci, the Kenwigs, the Mantolinis, Miss Knag, The Wititterlys, Tim Linkinwater, Peg Sliderskew, Mr Lillyvick, Miss Petowker and others. Even the main players who are left are shallow interpretations. The plot is drastically altered to accommodate this skeletonization, and the whole story is turned into a nonsense. Gone also is the fatal duel between Sir Mulberry Hawk and Lord Verisopht, the outcome of which is one of the main reasons for Ralph Nickleby's fall. Also gone is Arthur Gride, Madeline Bray's prospective albeit unwanted bridegroom, and NOT Sir Mulberry Hawk as portrayed here. Another change is that the Brays were originally placed as living in the Rules of the King's Bench debtor's prison, and although perhaps not so important with regard to the storyline, exactly why the producers deemed it necessary to alter this point (or any other parts of the story) is beyond me. The Brothers Cheeryble are made to look like discards from the Wizard of Oz, and whoever thought up the idea of Barry Humphries playing Mrs Crummles must have been on magic mushrooms. No mention is given to the ultimate fate of the Squeers family or the school, and the closing scenes include the Crummles, who, according to the novel, have by this time emigrated to America. ",2006

The only thing wrong with it, is that Selma Blair should have had a bigger role than she had now.

9,"When I first saw the previews this movie I dismissed it as just another chick flick. But after watching it, I must admit I was dead wrong. Though it is part chick flick, it's more like chick flick meets ""There's Something About Mary"". It was funny to see how women can get as downright raunchy as us guys. I think it tried to be like ""Sex in the City"". But it actually turned out much funnier and dirtier, and far more entertaining. How all of these people can give it such a low rating is beyond me. There must be a lot of prudes out there. I give it a 9 (only because I can't give it a 9.5).",2003

For those who are strung a bit too tight, this movie may not make much of an impression but for those of us who remember partying with the girls, being silly and just letting our hair down, this movie scores a 10. I think Cameron Diaz and Christina Applegate are terrific together and Selma Blair adds just a hint of awkward innocence where it's needed.  Kudos to the cast and writer.  It's a movie I'll watch again.",2002
10,This Movie is the funniest movie ever I have watched it every day since I bought it. Although poorly directed I think they have the best cast for it Cameron Diaz is stunning and Christina Applegate is hillarious and Thomas Jane is hot and funny and just the best person for the part I think. Selma Blaire Is always great. The movie has a great script and hysterical moments (The Glory Hole) I highly recommend seeing this movie...............................,2002
7,"You will always find either women are portrayed as hopelessly romantic or completely sex driven, the difference with ""The Sweetest Thing"" is that they want to have fun and explore their feminity without going overboard. Cameron Diaz is a classic as Christina Walters, proving again that she's a good actress. It was good to see Christina Applegate again, this time playing a more diverse role as Courtney Rockcliffe. The chemistry the two actresses shared as best friends was great to see, Selma Blair's Jane Burns was funny but not as interesting as the other two.",2002
7,"While not meant to be taken at all seriously, The Sweetest Thing is a great movie to watch with the gals when you're looking for something light and funny. It's almost like the female There's Something About Mary; it has a lot of bathroom humor, which I usually am not really amused by, but this works, and it's basically just about three best friends just being happy, which is a nice message for a change. I couldn't believe the things in it, though, since I thought the movie was PG-13 the first time I watched it. O_o The best touch is that it's slightly absurd, like Wet Hot American Summer, which brings in more attention and unparalleled amusement. Highly recommended for girls--they'd enjoy it a lot more than guys...it's the Rated R Chick Flick.",2003

I don't understand the scathing vitriol heaped at this movie from US critics -- how is it more ""offensive"" or ""insulting"" than 'American Pie' or 'Animal House'?  Is it because in this movie the women are the ones being bawdy and crass and not in their usual roles as naive school girls, there to be played by the male leads?  It's not a coincidence that the majority of critics who panned this movie are crotchety old men.",2002

10,Of course it's a female version of any Adam Sandler or Farrelly Brothers flick but Cameron Diaz is great. She's one of the few actors whose presence alone makes a movie watchable.,2002

Jokes that I have never seen any movie dare to make about women (""High five on the clean..."") but they really work well.

7,"I've read many of the comments left by previous viewers.  If you glance over them, you will notice a pattern.  Most of the scathing, heated comments are left by men, while the praising and positive ones are left by women.  That should leave you with this logical conclusion.  This is not a movie that most men will enjoy.  This is a movie primarily aimed at single women (although I'm married and I found it amusing).  Also, I realized that for some reason, people just can't seem to resist comparing this to ""There's Something About Mary.""  I could be wrong, but I don't think this is supposed to be a sequel or anything of the sort, so why compare?  It's two different movies.  If you're a single female, who likes to have fun and not take things so seriously, I would highly recommend this movie.  If you're male or of the Ethan Frome-type movie goer--then this is not for you. Enjoy.",2002

Watching the trailer and TV ads, one would go into ""The Rules of Attraction"" expecting another one in a long line of a stupid teen sex comedies. I had the benefit of knowing a good deal about this film well before it came out, and knowing what writer/director Roger Avary was going for with his film. This film is not intended to be another ""American Pie,"" but rather, it is a satire of films like ""American Pie,"" and the totally unrealistic worlds of those films. And Avary pulls this off perfectly, and as far as I'm concerned, ""The Rules of Attraction"" is a work of sheer genius.",2002
9,"Roger Avery succedes brilliantly in this impressive and horrifying adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' first novel. I read the novel 4 years ago as a Freshman in college after being blown away by 'American Psycho' and wanted to make 'Rules' into a film myself thinking no one would ever try. So much for that. Anyway, Avery impressed me alot. The series of Patrick Bateman references are also quite amusing for readers/viewers familiar with 'American Psycho'",2002
8,"This movie will leave you feeling so empty. There are no likeable characters and no standard storyline construction (there is no beginning, middle or end as such). But, you see, that's the point. This certainly will not be everybody's ""cup of coffee"" so to speak. Too many people like their movies to wrap everything up at the end and have everything explained to them and for Lassie to save the day. If you are one of these people then don't bother. On the other hand if you like a movie to challenge you then I am sure you will find ROA superb.",2002
10,"I saw the TV spot for this movie last year and i said to myself that i was going to avoid it at all costs, just another dumb teenage geared movie with one demintional charecters, not to mention the fact that i was afraid i was going to hear that god awfull ""She F*cking Hates Me"" song if i was going to see it. So, I completly avoided the damn thing until today, when a friend of mind who i greatly respect the oppions of said he heard that it was really good and that we should rent, i decided ""what the hell, I'll give the thing a chance"" and I am so glad that i did. This film is a work of art, plain and simple. It is NOT making sex and drugs seem cool or fun or anything of the sort. This movie is a complete send off of the idea that young adults can have carefree sex with no side effects. People who say this movie is just a typical teen movie need to look a little closer at what is really going on: every sex scene in this film is shot to make sex as unapealing as possible, in fact, the only time i was less turned on by sex scenes was watching ""A Clockwork Orange"", it shows sex as being something that when you make it a big deal in your life, it will consume you and draw out any humanity you may have. People who were like me that haven't seen this film yet, people who think ""It's just going to be another waste of time"" should see this film, and i have a feeling that if you really pay attention, you will see this disturbing masterpiece for what it really is.",2003
10,"For those who like their humor served with a side of cynicism and twisted laughs to wash it down with, 'The Rules of Attraction' is for you. From the author of 'American Psycho', it's yet another film you simply need to experience rather than read about.

8,"This is a movie that will sicken many people. Roger Avary faced a massive challenge when deciding to direct a film of Bret Easton Ellis' complex and hallucinary book. The book has no narrative focus, no beginning or end and focuses on a group of selfish, morally ambiguous characters. The story deals with drugs, rape, homosexuality,and obsessions of every kind, and despite Lion's Gate's best efforts to market the movie as a american pie-lite slice o' college life- the movie bombed in America.",2003
1,"This film is the cinematic equivalent of dirty, foul-smelling food remains left in the bottom of the kitchen bin for more than a week, i.e. rubbish. It is peopled by amoral, unlikeable characters with no redeeming features. There is very little in the way of story, so it is not in fact possible to type a spoiler even if you want to. Nothing happens. The protagonists just become less and less pleasant (if that is possible) as the film progresses. There are one or two characters that you might feel sorry for, but since their actions do not make sense, there is little point to them. Make no mistake, this is horrible. Steer clear unless you want to feel dirty and degraded for having sat through it all.",2004
2,"Every so often a film comes out which reaffirms my distrust in humanity and makes me want to consider becoming a hermit.  Rules of Attraction is that movie.  Chronicling a year in a college populated by well-off children, the film focuses on four kids (Somerhalder, a poor man's Wes Bentley, Sossaman, the one decent thing in the movie, Van Der Beek and Biel, both in ""my mom thinks I'm edgy"" performances) who have little interest in anything outside of sex, drugs and rock and roll.",2003
8,"I rented this movie not really knowing what to expect, but having heard a lot about it figured it would be worth checking out. And I was blown away. First of all, who knew Dawson (er, James Van Der Beek) could act so well? I remember hearing part of the reason he took this role was specifically to get away from the good-boy image he'd developed from Dawson's Creek, and he did so beautifully. He was barely recognizable. I was very, very impressed by his performance.",2006
2,"I am possibly the biggest hypocrite among movie fiends everywhere and the evidence is in my voting history (I gave a two-score to The Graduate and I ranted at length about how the film sucked but I gave Risky Business a ten-score). There are very few films I actually despise that are probably good and many films I like that are utter bunk.  The Rules of Attraction is one movie I can't stand and I will not recant on that. Before any other users pass judgment on me, here are two redeeming factors that seperates this movie from excrutiating and unbearable.  As always, there maybe a spoiler or two here. 1) The cinematography, speed playback, and seperated screens that were used throughout Rules made it visually pretty. 2) I did laugh at the scene in the hotel where Dick and Paul were with their moms. It was so insanely inept I couldn't help but chuckle.",2003
9,"After viewing The Rules of Attraction, one can definitely see how Roger Avary and Quentin Tarantino were friends. Upon leaving their jobs as video store clerks, the two went out and did Reservoir Dogs together, before collaborating on Pulp Fiction. Tarantino took all the credit for those two movies, basically striking Avary out of Dogs completely and only giving him story credit for Pulp. With Rules of Attraction, one sees that there was probably more influence on both films. While this adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' novel contains many clichéd style maneuvers, they all work effectively in telling the tale. Multiple uses of rewind, spilt screen, and the re-showing of events could have been a drastic failure of cheap trickery with less able hands. Here, though, Avary shows some skill and uses everything to further advance a complicated tapestry of story lines and encounters from the stellar cast of young up-and-comers.",2006
10,"I haven't read all of the users' comments, but the ones I HAVE read seem to not quite get the point of the film.  IT'S AN A-D-A-P-T-A-T-I-O-N. Of a book. Not to mention the mystery behind it: Bret Easton Ellis is a brilliant writer, yet all the movie adaptations suck mighty. I personally was laughing all the way through it (except of course during the bathtub scene which I thought was gruesomely fantastic in its portrayal). So even if you didn't get it, at least it was funny. I was thrilled during the addition of Mini-Glamorama, and just to keep everyone on the right track, Sean Bateman is not the ""college version"" of the American Psycho narrator; if he was, his name would've been Patrick Bateman, Christian Bale's character in the movie. Sean is Patrick's little brother; there was supposed to be a scene where Van Der Beek calls Bale and Bale has a severed head in his hand on the other end, but Bale wasn't available. If you hated it, and it wasn't for you, just think: You could've seen the NC-17 version. Otherwise, don't knock the ""shallowness"" and ""emptiness"" of the characters or the actors please; that's not what it was about, and it's not what the book intended. Bret Easton Ellis is a genius.",2002
1,"This is the most horrible movie I've ever seen, and I've sat through both Ishtar and all three of the Dead Gentleman films. I had to watch this movie for a research project and got it for free through an interlibrary loan program, but this movie wasn't worth the five seconds it took me to track it down in WorldCat, let alone the four hours (I had to watch Ian Somerhalder's commentary track as well) I spent watching it. The visuals are impressive, I'll admit that, but the lack of any kind of redeeming story quality killed it for me. ",2005
7,"The main characters are not always as interesting or well presented as  they should be, so its very hard to care about them that much. You kind  of know their particular plight, without them having to spell it out,  but some insight into each person might not have hurt too much. Each  character narrates a large part of their own story. However, the  director does a lot with the material to keep it lively. You get split  screens, backwards running film, slow motion, etc. and it fits the  subject perfectly.  Cameos are interesting, to say the least - its not every movie where  you get to see Fred Savage strung out, or see an insane  emergency room doctor. Eric Stoltz, Faye Dunaway and Swoozie Kurtz are  also aboard but don't stay around for too long.   The character Kip Pardue plays, Victor, gets a bit of a raw deal, as  he's seen in the beginning for a minute, then again at the end, when  you get a video diary, of sorts, of his escapades around Europe. In the  book he's handled differently. I like Kip, who played Sunshine in  ""Remember the Titans"" and was also in that stupid race car movie with  Sly Stallone and Burt Reynolds. I had a shrink hypnotize me so I'd  forget the name of that one, but Kip was in it, that much I remember.   My favorite character by light years is Richard (sorry...he prefers  Dick, and loves saying it), who's a friend/lover of Paul (Ian  Somerhalder, who's great). Dick is in the movie for about ten minutes  but makes a lasting impression, dancing on a hotel bed with Paul to the  strains of George Michael's ""Faith"", then having a hysterically funny  scene in the hotel w/Paul and their Moms. NO ONE in the movie is as  much fun as Dick, and I was a bit letdown when he exited. He seemed to  have a wild sense of humor about how screwed up he was.  I've seen this about five times by now. I don't love it, and I have  some problems with some of the overkill, but I like it a lot. 7/10.",2003

2,"Saw The Rules of Attraction this weekend, and I must admit it was disappointing. Not that it's not without it's merits. Like most Lion's Gate productions it's beautifully shot, with all the split screens and reverse action shots giving the film a very distinctive look. The soundtrack, which runs the gamut from the Cure to Serge Gainsbourg, also adds a nice touch to the film. Roger Avary did a nice job adding the bells and whistles to the movie. Too bad he didn't use more of the time he devoted in this task to work on the script.",2002

Avary makes this film fit into a dozen types of film, a satire, drama, black comedy, romance just to name a few.",2003
10,"The rules of attraction is by far one of the most original films this decade. It is worth watching alone for the corridor scene, the beginning and the journey through victors travels. The actors in the film portray their roles perfectly. James van der beek really matures since his days from Dawson's creek to show how versatile he can be using a range of different emotions to show Sean as a sensitive yet sinister character. The script is quite Phenomenal especially the humor that is present throughout. Each character explains what they are feeling so the audience can understand their motives easier. The plot has twists and turns that are thrown to the viewer and can leave you questioning how the writer can be that intelligent. Finally the other characters performances are flawless especially Clifton Collins Jr. who really shows the effect of sniffing too much coke. Buy it Watch it tell your friends.",2005
2,"Every character in this film has the same personality. They are all vacant automatons living empty lives with empty brains knee jerking their way to their next abuse of sex, drugs, music etc. The characters are neither believable, likable, sympathetic nor developed. I suppose 12 year old teenage boys might think this film reveals what ""cool"" people are actually like, but any adult should be able to see that in real life one rarely encounters such demented assholes and a whole town full of them is just a childish fantasy. Both the author and director of this junk are way overpaid, over-hyped, and over convinced of their own brilliance which the discerning viewer will find no evidence of here.",2005
1,"This is an awful movie and I feel like I wasted 110 minutes of my life for watching it.  The characters are aweful, the Sean Bateman character is completely different in each seen and although one could say it is due to his mental illness, it doesn't work.  The movie tried to feed off of the popularity of American Psycho (which was their first mistake, because although it was good, it could not fuel a sequel with completely different characters).  I feel sick just thinking about this movie.  And previous reviews were correct in discussing how pretentious this movie was.",2003

4,The Rules of Attraction is definitely an interesting movie. One of the most interesting things about it was that my whole view of the movie changed after I had seen it and I saw on IMDb it was based on a novel by Bret Easton Ellis. Everything weird about this movie suddenly made way more sense when you know it's written by the same guy who wrote Less Than Zero and American Psycho. Also helped when I actually remembered ho Roger Avary is. ,2017

Watch 81 minutes of gut-wrenching nerve-wracking dialog reduce a pretentious ""kiss my ass"" punk into an enervated and regretful reprobate. Farrell is simply awesome in portraying the gravity of the situation. ""The Caller""'s voice is absolutely worth a mention. Calm, creepy and authoritative! Something different and the movie would have fallen flat on its 'flab less' anterior. Sutherland plays 'The Caller', manning a high profile sniper rifle, while he thrusts honesty upon Stu Shephard (Colin Farrell). Frankly, I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen for a second. ",2005
10,"I saw the premiere of ""Phone Booth"" at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival, and I LOVED IT!  It's unusual for a feature like this to even show at the TIFF, which should say something about it.  I know it sounds like a hard sell.  The whole thing takes place outside a phone booth in Manhattan, and it was shot in 10 days for less than 2 million dollars.  But this movie is electric.  It BLEW ME AWAY!  Stuart `Stu' Shepard (Colin Farrell), a sleazy publicist, uses this phone booth to call his girlfriend, because his wife checks his cell phone bills.  The phone rings, and when he picks it up, all hell breaks loose.  The voice on the other end (Kiefer Sutherland is just terrifying) warns him that if he leaves the booth he will be killed.  At first Stu doesn't believe him, but we find out pretty quick that his life is in real danger, and the stranger on the other end of the line knows EVERYTHING about Stu and his life.  Then the police show up, (Forest Whitaker is wonderful as always as the cop in charge) and order Stu out of the booth.  I spent the next hour on the edge of my seat.  I don't want to give anything more away, but it is one of the most suspenseful movies I've seen in a very long time!  You should go see this movie!  I don't think it's going to get a very big release, even though it's directed by Joel Schumacher (St. Elmo's Fire, Flatliners, Batman and Robin, 8mm, Tigerland).  Schumacher was at the screening, and he talked about how a number of different actors (including  Mel Gibson) and directors had been attached to the script, and it had taken years to get it to the screen.  He was able to do it with Colin Farrell after 20th Century Fox exec's saw him in `Tigerland' and decided to take a chance.  But he's still not considered a `big' star.  And Kiefer only came to the project at the end (though Schumacher said he was the only guy for the role, and I agree), and you don't see him much.  So the movie may not get much of a push when it comes out.  Don't let that dissuade you.  If you like a good ride, you should go see this movie.",2002

7,"Director Joel Schumacher preserves his reputation with a script by Larry Cohen about personal morals and hopefully the truth providing some kind of redemption. This is a white knuckle nerve wrecker about a self-serving publicist(Colin Farrell)making the mistake of his life by answering a public telephone. On the other end of the phone is a self empowered mad man(Kiefer Sutherland) inflicting demands on the fast talking, fast thinking publicity dealer who just happened to be walking by the phone booth he passes every day. The mystery voice on the phone demands the publicist to stay in the phone booth until he tells his wife(Radha Mitchell)and the TV watching public of his cheating, lying and making use of others. Of course behind the demanding voice is a sharpshooter that is not afraid to pull the trigger. The senior officer on the scene(Forest Whitaker)tries to make sense of the situation while fighting back thoughts of his own past personal problems. At least 90% of this thriller is made up of witty, threatening and revealing banter between Farrell and Sutherland. And talk about a clever twist to end this flick. Also of note in the cast are: Katie Holmes, Richard T. Jones and Paula Jai Parker. Think twice about answering that ringing phone.",2004
10,"At first I thought the film was going to be just a normal thriller but it turned out to be a thousand times better than I expected. The film is truly original and was so dark & sinister that gives the tensive mood also it is emotionally & psychologically thrilling, the whole movie is charged with pulse pounding suspense and seems like it's really happening. It's amazing that how they managed to make an 80 minute movie with just a guy in a phone booth but the full credit goes to Colin Farrell and Larry Cohen the writer not Joel Schumacher because he is a crappy director. Joel Schumacher's films are rubbish especially The Number 23, Phone Booth was shot in 10 days with a budget of $10 million so it wasn't a hard job to make it, that's why Joel doesn't get any credit but the cast & crew did a fantastic job. I also really liked the raspberry coloured shirt Colin was wearing and it was an excellent choice of clothing because the viewers are going to watch him throughout the whole film. When I first saw the movie I fell in love with it and I bought it on DVD the next day and I've seen it about 20 times and I'm still not fed up with it. Phone Booth is and always will be Colin Farrell's best film! Overall it is simply one of my favourite films and I even argued over my friend because he didn't like it.",2007
10,"It is hard for me to believe that for some reason I missed viewing this film, which took me by great surprise. The photography around NYC and Times Square was great and that special phone booth drove me crazy. The film started out with a con artist who never stop lying and had everybody completely fooled until one fatal day when he made a phone call as his daily routine at the end of his baloney days work. It drove me crazy when he had to confess his sins to an audience, including his mistress and wife. The con artist turned his complete life around and even helped a NYC detective wish he had told the complete truth to his own wife. There is plenty of deep suspense that keeps you glued to the screen and your seat. Refreshing film and worth viewing.",2005

9,"Contains Spoiler A tense, taut, darkly funny 81-minute package of Hitchcockian suspense set in New York City (although the scenes specifically involving the phone booth were filmed in Los Angeles, the art direction and veteran thriller genius Larry Cohen's biting script gave those scenes a very convincing Times Square ambience. It really reminded me of the seedy Times Square of my youth! :-), PHONE BOOTH is a film that everyone in front of and behind the camera should be proud of.  In particular, it's a tour de force for Colin Farrell and Kiefer Sutherland.  Farrell, doing a good Bronx accent that also sounds slightly Latino-tinged to my native New Yorker ears, shows why he was long touted as The Next Big Thing even before he finally got some hit movies under his belt. As slippery publicist Stu Shepard, the intense, kinetic Farrell runs the gamut of emotions; he's like Nicolas Cage in dramatic mode without the scenery-chewing! :-) Sutherland has never been more sinister in a mostly voiceover role as Farrell's nemesis/self-appointed conscience. Ron Eldard reportedly did the voice of The Caller first, but maybe after seeing the rushes, PB director Joel Schumacher decided the part needed more star power and/or menace, so he recruited his old bud' and colleague Sutherland. It was a good move, and I'm not just saying that because Sutherland is one of my longtime faves. When Sutherland plays bad guys, he gets this great silky menace to his voice (kinda like James Mason without the British accent :-), and it's very effective in PB.  Sutherland is seen very briefly in the film, too, so I must assume they filmed that footage later, but it certainly blends in seamlessly with the rest of the movie. SPOILER ALERT... I actually found it darkly funny, even Kafkaesque, that The Caller's reasons for terrorizing arrogant married PR flack Stu included his aspiring to lure actress/client Pam (the ever-appealing Katie Holmes) into an affair. Think about it:  The Caller was so twistedly self-righteous and judgmental that he was punishing his victims (or Stu, anyway) for thought-crimes!  How Big Brother can you get?! :-) ...END SPOILER ALERT.  While PB was well worth seeking out in actual theaters, especially since it has lots of cool split-screen shots and inset effects that are especially effective on a big screen, its claustrophobic nature also makes it well-suited to the small TV screen. Check out Schumacher's enjoyable DVD commentary, too.",2004

Mr. Schumacher has done plenty better and none worse, and the really sad thing is that this movie had plenty of potential to be great.  Somewhere around 20 minutes into the movie I stopped caring whether any of them made it out alive or not.  Thank god it was only 80 minutes long.  I might have shot myself if it had gone on any longer.  For another movie scripted along the same lines, but carried off with more panache and fewer big names, try watching Liberty Stands Still (Linda Fiorentino, Wesley Snipes)  This shooter actually has motive and there is a clever script, an intelligent plot line, and characters that appeal to the audience.",2003

I was hoping for twists (SPOILER i.e. the wife had done something bad and was the real target, and the whole film was a send up to that act; I mean come on - was his character really that flawed to warrant this action against him... he lied to people? I'm supposed to believe this was what he was being punished for?) As Colin Farrell should have exited the phonebooth after the first call - I should have exited the theater soon after.",2003

But trust when I say that this movie was just great! The film stars Colin Farrell, Forest Whitaker, Katie Holmes, and Radha Mitchell, and is about a man who is held hostage in a phone booth by a sniper. Without spoiling anything, I will say that this is definitely a comeback for Joel Schumacher, after making Batman & Robin. It is a well-directed, well-acted, fast paced, solid flick which I wasn't bored with for a second. I thought that Colin Farrell was great as the lead actor in the movie, and I'm sure that whoever is interested in solid thrillers will most likely like this flick. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of the genre! 10/10",2013
10,"a very very impressive and gripping kind of psychological thriller i have ever seen in my life. Colin Farrel was great in his role while on the other hand kiefer Sutherland did the most best tremendous job as the unknown hidden caller who never showed up until the end comes. The real movie starts at the time when Colin Farrel is held hostage at the phone booth by the unknown hidden kiefer Sutherland but before he also puts the curtain away from the secret life of Farrel on the other line by calling his girl friend and Farrel was listening but wasn't able to do any thing then he demonstrate to Farrel that he has got an eye on him , a telescopic view through a 50 caliber rifle and if he tries to walk away he ll be shot at point blank range. and now the chase begins when Stu Shepard is forced to tell the truths about his life which he hided form his wife , girlfriend, his secretary and colleagues. Forrest Whitaker plays here the police detective who arrives at the scene when a crime is committed and Farrel is considered as prime suspect but he is amazed by the ongoing situation , he really wants to know who s on the line with Farrel , what conversation they are having how can he make Farrel out of the booth and surrender. In this scenario of the movie the shooter in fact is a person who hates lier's , deceptive and hypocrites , his main purpose is to punish them by his own and expose their mysterious double standard lives with fraud attitude.

It is a thoroughly original idea - a publicist, who has been lying his way to success, is held inside the phone booth he has been using to cheat on his wife by an unseen sniper on the other end of the line, who wants him to confess to his wife. It is very well acted, with Colin Farrell portraying the desperation of his character really well, while Kiefer Sutherland, while only seen for a few seconds, plays ""The Caller"" very well. His character is a very good and original one, as while he does kill innocent people without remorse, his real victims are chosen well. He uses threat to try and force them to come clean, and stop cheating in life. It is one of the few films where you find yourself rooting for the bad guy. His voice on the phone is also chillingly brilliant. Without that voice, the film wouldn't be nearly as effective in achieving the suspense generated. Forrest Whitaker also puts in a nice performance as the detective trying to resolve the situation.",2007
10,"Robin Williams once again proves how good comedians can be at serious drama roles. Williams is especially good at playing creepy characters, as he has done several times in the last decade.",2006
10,"Yes, Robin Williams does steal the show.  He's an underrated actor, who, given a good script can deliver a mind boggling performance.  That's exactly what One hour photo is, a good script with brilliant performances.  The whole cast does an excellent job of showing how the events of one deranged man can impact the lives of many.  Let's get one thing straight, though, this not a mainstream movie.  It is very much an independant film.  If you don't like movies with little action or a low budget don't see this movie. This film is good because of its' strong performances and decent script. I must say, though, without Williams as the lead, this movie would not have been as good as it was.",2003
10,"I loved this movie.  Romanek pays attention to the minute details often overlooked by most directors through the use of natural lighting, exceptional cinemaphotography that gives you a moment to take in the scenery and a soundtrack that doesn't force the viewer to keep fiddling with the volume.  At 90 minutes in length, there is no pointless filler doesn't bore you and irrelevant side plots to push it to the 2-hour mark.  It's a movie you can sit back and enjoy without feeling distracted by ridiculous special effects, jittery camera work or a disjointed plot.  It has a peaceful, deep and thoughtful feel to the narration and dialog that is enhanced and complimented by the soundtrack.  You can identify with the characters because they're not some Hollywood fantasy - but real and identifiable everyday people who react as you would expect everyday people to react.",2003
7,"One Hour Photo is a film of supreme caliber. The film is powered by the haunting, chilling, silencing, and above all-genius performance by Robin Williams. But the rather extraordinary thing is that it is not Robin Williams on the screen, it's Sy Parish (the character's name). Robin Williams fades away from our senses and slips into the ever so sweet and innocent yet psychotic role of a supermarket's photo developer. The films script is only accented by Williams, at times, restrained performance. Williams ignites on the screen and burns till the last frame, and you are unable to take your eyes off him. As I mentioned the film is subliminily written as well as directed. Though being Romanek's first, I certainly don't think this is a bad start. Romanek's direction adds to the on-going tension throughout the film. More affecting is Williams' delightful calmness. Trying to hold himself in becomes more troublesome for both Williams and his character as the story develops. Yet through the calm eyes of an innocent blaze the fires of hatred and intensity, which could very well sum up Williams' performance. The film does have some disturbing images as well. Yet they are not really strong enough for you to get up from your seat and leave yet rather the opposite. Williams' contribution as well as guidance towards the actions and scenes of peril compell as well as amaze you towards both the performance and film itself. Williams' shocking contribution to the screen is enough to make you cry, scream, and yell in your seat. Because the origins of the character are bittersweet just like own known Williams, leads to a crazed and psychotic breakdown. It's as if watching our own funny and beloved Robin fail us. Though the truth could not be any further, Williams but succeeds in the art of acting, creating an achievement in the field. Creating a landmark. Writing his/its own chapter. I guarantee that this film will be required study material in acting classes for now on. In conclusion: definitely one of the best of 2002.",2003

10,"I'd heard about this movie, it came and went, then finally I rented it on DVD and I loved it. Robin Williams' acting is a very brilliant surprise. Every shot keeps you interested in what will follow. From the opening scene with Sy wanting to look at his photos during the police interrogation, I kept wanting to see these myself. His creepy, put-upon persona reminded me of several people I'd been acquainted with over the years, and, yes, even reminded me of some of my own neediness.",2005
10,"No, ""One Hour Photo"" is not for the faint of heart. Nor is it a movie to see if all you want is the escapism the movies so often offer us. For those who want that, there are no shortage of other movies out there, and good ones in their own right.",2002
7,"When the movie ended I was momentarily upset because I felt the climax was too vague.  But the more I thought about it, the more things fell into place.  If you like your movies, crystal clear and are expecting Hanibal Lecter, this picture is not for you.  On the other hand, if you occasionally like something a little more cerebral, that perhaps makes you uncomfortable, and forces you to ponder optional realities, you're about to take a ride on a moral roller coaster.  At the end, ask yourself, who is the bad guy and who is the hero?",2003
10,"I'll try to avoid divulging anything actually in the plot and touch on the overriding themes.  Yes, it is conspicuously disturbing and probably should be filed under the same classification that contains Full Metal Jacket and A Clockwork Orange and consequently is rightly rated R.  That said, for the right audience, it delves into the quandary oft pondered, Where does categorical love cease and morph into destructive psychological illness?  Furthermore, focus on the plight of the lonely white lower-middle class worker who feels that society (read special interests and the government) neglects him but chooses to forgo complaining. Probably the the most potent element to the film is that it is quite realistic.  The acting, script, and plot stand muster.  9/10.",2002
10,"Before I begin, I should mention that I have been an Alfred Hitchcock fan since the age of five, and for me to even compare any film made in the last twenty years to even the worst Hitchcock film is totally unheard of.  I view hitchcock as most film buffs view Orson Welles.  With that being said, I left the movie theater after viewing One Hour Photo utterly spellbound. The same uneasy (not necessarily nervous) feeling that one experiences during a film like Notorious or North By Northwest can be experienced here.  The audience isn't scared of Williams' character, they're uncomfortable around him, which is just how the other characters in the film view him.  The other great element of the film is that it is easy to follow.  While the trend in the mystery / thriller genre of today is to confuse and disorientate the audience as a means of creating tension, the director takes down a straight road that has several bumps along the way, which provides the same tension without all the confusion (See this film, then watch either Memento or Mulholland Drive).  I can go on and on, but I will leave you with the this as a close to this review.  This is the first film in some years that I left the movie theater feeling that I really got my money's worth ($8.00 per ticket).",2002
10,"This one gets an A+ from me.  Stark terror in broad daylight.  This is not an action movie, but very much a suspense movie in the Hitchcock tradition. Not for hyperkinetic teens -- no big gunfights, extended chase scenes, or fireballs -- but for adults who like suspense.  It is like a Shyamalan film without the gore, and nothing like ""Silence of the Lambs"".",2002

10,"One Hour Photo provided me with a mixture of extreme sadness and pure delight. The main character, who`s a real ""peeping tom"", is played with such sincerity by Robin Williams who seems to have gotten the hang of playing the ""bad guy"" (last seen in Insomnia).In style and theme it`s easy to compare this flick with films like Magnolia and American Beauty, by which all of them portrays the crucial and life-changing moments which happens to the protagonist. I wouldn`t complain if OHP won an Oscar for best film, but unfortunately the statuette will probably go to some extravagant story with no references to most peoples personal life (ala Gangs of New York)instead of this wonderful treasure. Bye",2003
10,"One Hour Photo is a must-see movie.  Robin Williams does an incredible job playing a lonely and creepy man.  Unlike most of the pictures I've seen recently (Signs and Minority Report for example), the ending was not flat or anti-climactic.  I never once felt like a line was out of place or unimportant.  Everything made sense and there were no true surprises.  A well-written screenplay and many great performances made this a movie worth seeing over and over.",2002

From every roll of film they bring in, he makes copies just for himself. He soon begins to imagine that he is a part of the family. He really does like these people, and wants nothing more than for them to like him. He gives the 9-year old boy free toys and such from the store he works. He does lots of things in hope of them liking him. I don't want to say that much more, in fear of giving too much away, but it gets extremely disturbing.",2002

9,"One of Charlie Kaufman's more overlooked and underrated screenplays, 'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind' may have been something of a departure from the high-concept experimentalism that made his previous brainchildren, 'Being John Malkovich' and 'Adaptation' (a masterpiece and a near-masterpiece, respectively) such striking breaths of fresh air, but on no account should its ability to engage and entertain on those strengths of its own be underestimated. Taking a well-earned break from the surreal situations and the complex plotting, Kaufman turned his attention here to a much more straightforward yarn that was better grounded in reality; the twist there being that it was based on a story that, while allegedly true, just as likely never happened. 'Confessions' though is willing to give Chuck Barris the benefit of the doubt in regards to his dubious claims to have been a secret assassin for the CIA in the midst of his days as a game show host, giving life to such controversial classic as 'the Gong Show' and 'the Dating Game' while taking it from a range of human targets around the globe. It sits back and lets the scenario unfold without question  and does so with such considerable spirit and vigour that it's hard not to get lured in and pulled along for the ride. Regardless of whether the real-life Barris truly did have some incredible adventures within his time, or simply an overly-active imagination, this movie translates it into one heck of an enjoyable romp  slick, stylish and entrancing on the surface, and with a bracingly poignant and sobering tale lurking underneath.",2005
7,"What if the creator and host of two of the 1970s biggest and lamest television game shows was also a part-time CIA hitman?  That he used The Dating Game and The Gong Show as a cover to stage assassinations in the netherworld of Cold War espionage. Ridiculous you'd say. But that's what exactly what Chuck Barris claims in his autobiography, and Charlie Kaufman accepts carte blanche as the premise for his screenplay. The film plays it straight up as if Barris were telling the truth. ",2004
8,"While quite very obviously a well crafted lie sold as truth this movie does not fail to entertain and was one of the more underrated films of the year of it's release. A commercial failure the film was re-released later based on word of mouth buzz. This film appeals to a fringe audience that remains just out of reach of mainstream films. What do you expect from a screenplay written by Charlie Kaufmann? This film is a telling of the story of Chuck Barris, creator of various TV shows and all around uncomfortable guy. Barris holds many stations in life, TV producer, songwriter and CIA assassin. The meat of this story is not so much in his occupations but the mental condition and back story of Barris throughout the film. With something lurking just below the surface of an ambiguous nature you aren't certain if you should root for Barris or despise him.",2005

Soon he becomes a manager type person, and creates an idea for a game show called `The Dating Game'. It becomes a hit, but he feels unfulfilled, even though he has Penny (Drew Barrymore).

4,"If you were a fan of the Gong show you might find some humor in this, however, this is a joke of a movie.  It's very mindnumbing and probably the biggest flaw of this movie is it should have never been made.  George Clooney does his best to make it somewhat intelligent, but I have to ask this, why did it take him 10 or 12 years to succeed in Hollywood with his looks and family?  Obviously he is not the most intelligent guy.  Oh and how daring!  He has Julia Roberts in it, and also has Brad Pitt and Matt Damon with cameos.  Oh wow...  I'm shocked.  A good independent movie is one where the cameos are surprising and different.  This was just crap.",2003
6,"I had high hopes for this movie, but I'm sorry to say they were not met. It seemed to have trouble deciding if it was a comedy, a drama or something else. Other movies have walked this tightrope much better. It was competently directed, and Clooney created some good shots, but it failed to draw me or my companion into the plot. We found it hard to really care for the characters. I doubt I will bother to watch it again when it makes it to cable/satellite....",2003

6,"It should be absolutely awful. Who really wants to see a filmed version of the masturbational journals of an idiot like Chuck Barris? Actually, I'd forgive him for The Gong Show and the $1.98 Beauty Show. I've seen them both, and they're somewhat entertaining. I couldn't forgive him for writing such a pointless book as Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. So it is an enormous credit to George Clooney, making his directorial debut, that he keeps this film as good as it is throughout its entire run. I can't believe Charlie Kaufman could have written this alongside Being John Malkovich and Adaptation. It's a junky script desperately groping for profundity and/or sympathy for its lame central character. There are only a few moments of worthwhile humor. I especially like the annoying Dating Game contestant who wants Chuck to make the girl like him more. The acting is pretty good, too. Drew Barrymore, whom I don't care too much for, gives one of her best performances. I also liked Clooney himself, in an emotionless role that works well for him. Julia Roberts makes a nice visual impression, but the script didn't provide her character with any interest whatsoever. The cinematography is very beautiful, as well. But, like I said, the film belongs to Clooney and his stylish direction. Clooney often gets a bad rap for his acting, and, a lot of the time, I have to agree. So maybe he'll continue along this line and, with a better script, make a great film. 6/10.",2003
1,"This film could have and should have been a barrel of fun, but has been turned into a ponderous, overlong, self-important, repetitive, and ultimately confused and pointless movie.  The trouble is at the basic level. You can't really make this brooding ""showbusiness"" tale when most of the film is taken up with the ludicrous idea that Barris was a CIA hitman.  The film should have been a small wild lark.  But this thing is written and directed with a heavy and pretentious hand.  And it is a uniquely unpleasant experience to watch.  The only fun comes from the period game show recreations.  The rest is a repetitive bore with a completely unlikable, uninteresting, and unsympathetic character.  I can't believe I'm saying it, but Chuck Barris deserved better.  Check out the ""Gong Show Movie"" from 1980, you'll have more fun....",2003

4,"Chuck Barris, who became a television icon in the mid-1970s while acting as producer-creator-host of TV's ""The Gong Show"", has his humble and strange beginnings reenacted by first-time director George Clooney, who curiously displays a loving affection for innocent American nostalgia and yet a puny breadth of imagination behind the camera. Clooney's set-ups for each scene are in joshing good humor, spiked by fantasy visuals that give the project a light, jovial mood, but--aside from an amusing camera-shot peering through a cut-out shape of the United States and a tricky bit involving Julia Roberts and two coffee cups--nothing from Clooney shows much originality or chutzpah (the handling of the picture is as canned as a TV laugh-track). The performances are intentionally over-scaled, which doesn't give us a good grip on the personal strife and drama that frames the film, and the alleged CIA sub-plot is a squashy mess. This was a life story no one really wanted to see adapted to the screen, and even Clooney (as both director and supporting actor, playing the CIA operative who recruits Barris) is more cheeky than serious. ** from ****",2007

10,"This movie is well-made, stylish and extremely entertaining. However, as stated by the review from a Hong Kong viewer, there is also depth and subtlety rarely found in action/thrillers. It is this depth that makes this movie brilliant. The depth of this movie is best served by the understated yet deeply moving performances of the main characters. Viewers are allowed into the inner changes of these characters and before long, the viewers begin to care about them, be it the ""good guy"" (Yan) or the ""bad guy"" (Ming). The rest of cast successfully relate the complicated and exciting plot to the viewers, and all the supporting performances are almost flawless, perhaps with the exception of the female psychologist who seems sadly one-dimensional. I grew up in Hong Kong but has since lived most of my life in Canada. With this duo-cultural background, I have mixed feelings about the Hollywood remaking of this movie. On the one hand, I am happy for the Hollywood recognition of this great movie by remaking it. On the other hand, I would hate to see how badly sabotaged the end result would be. Some things just do not translate. As a minimum, I hope the great director Scorcese will make good use of the major plot line and generate a haute thriller and with the excellent cast, develop some in-depth characterization.

Fast-paced and bold, with a generous score, it never insults the viewer's intelligence either, and features just the right level of moral ambiguity.

It does not have a grand acting Jack Nicholson who basically plays Daryl Van Horne with the attitude and ""Infernal Affairs"" characters don't talk and don't curse as much as they do in ""The Departed"" but the Hong Kong's movie only benefits from it.

Indeed, much of the film is told in dialogue, there are no ridiculous action sequences, and the final rooftop confrontation is both incredibly intense and masterful in keeping such a sprawling tale enclosed in such a small, yet fitting finale.

Without ""Internal Affairs,"" ""The Departed"" would not exist. The film is not without its flaws-it is, at times hokey and lapses between scenes derail the continuity at points. But the intriguing premise, vivid characters, slick visuals, and break-neck pacing come together to produce a film that isn't only fun to watch, but substantive. It would be unfair to place Scorcese's re-make on the pedestal it stands to occupy, without acknowledging this film.",2006
9,There is something very invigurating about Asian cinema. I think it has to do with the free reign the film makers are given. Unlike hollywood they really don't have to adhere to focus groups or near sighted Hollywood suits. They are able to take their stories to places that we as North American viewers are not fully accustomed to.,2003

10,"This has to be one of the greatest things I have ever laid my eyes upon. Not only is this anime educational, but it's also filled to the brim with class A actors, including the man himself, Stefan Karl Stefansson, aka, Robbie Rotten. Robbie is an extremely likable villain with character development and a heart wrenching backstory. If all of this isn't enough to convince you that this is a perfect anime, then I think this may do it... Robbie Rotten has a hit song called ""We Are Number One."" Give it a listen; it may change your life forever... if you allow it to. (Warning: This song may cause you to go through intense emotions that may trigger lachrymation. I have no consent over your emotions, and have no influence over the decision you choose to make). May God bless you all.",2016

10,"For a kid's show, Lazytown is surprisingly sophisticated, it is a positive role model for kids all around the world. It motivates kids to exercise and eat well. It can also thoroughly entertain teenagers and adults, too. The music is excellent. Having grown up watching the original series (Julianna Rose Mauriello), I cannot comment on the new series. But I am sure it is outstanding also. The puppets are well coordinated and very realistic. The music and songs are addictive and well-written and teach children many lessons. The acrobatic parkour of Sportacus is very appropriate to Sportacus' role as a superhero. Magnus Scheving, can perform very well. Stephanie can sing and dance well. Sportacus is performed by an Olympic-class Icelandic acrobat and gymnast, who also created, produce and wrote the show. Magnus, you have something magical here!",2016
10,"Yes! Yes, I know a ten?!? Read on people: If you have no kids under the age of 12, there is no point in reading this. If you have kids under 16 months of age, why are YOU sitting them in front of the TV in the first place? This is for parents whose kids are at kindergarten or the first elementary school years. If you are them, enjoy! You can chose to believe or not, but we at home do not allow more than 120 accumulated TV minutes for the kids. We keep'em busy, and we make them play for an hour before they can sit 30 mins. in front of the tube.",2006
10,"LazyTown has changed my life drastically ever since I started watching. Miraculously, my cancer was cured just from watching the first season. Soon after starting the show, my mother returned from the dead after she died in a car accident, and my father, whom I hadn't seen since I was an infant, came back. I ran into my high school crush at Stop and Shop and we hit it off, which has resulted in our marriage and she is now 7 months pregnant with our first child. Without LazyTown, none of this could have ever happened, and thus I attribute the creation of this show with the curing of my depression, along with the cancer I mentioned above. Because of this flawless show, I have started a new religion where we worship the divine powers of Sportacus and Robbie Rotten. Excellent work in general for this 10/10 show.",2016

Blue's Clues is educational and my kids loved it but Lazy Town is fun, energetic AND educational. :D I love the focus on health and fitness. :) I have two kids, a 6 year old boy and a 3 year old girl. Both ADORE this show! We dance around and talk about what happened on the show that day. lol My son comes home and asks his sister what happened and looks forward to pd days so he can watch it himself. rofl The kids even ask for ""sports candy"" (aka apples) as snacks! I have a basket of them on the table for them to snack on and they love it! ",2006
9,Still Game is an absolute little gem of a comedy taking Victor and Jack from their sketch's in 'Chewin the Fat'into the wider world of fictional Glasgow scheme estate Craigland.,2005
10,"There are some mixed opinions i see, and i guess thats what its all about. However firstly may i add that this series is massive North of the border and you do need a Scottish sense of humour to really enjoy this. I can't see the English enjoying this at all since either side of the border differ greatly on tastes. ",2004
10,"I found this on Netflix. I've always loved the humor of Ireland and Scotland and figured, eh, I'll watch an episode or two. 13 were available (seasons 4 and 5) and I watched every one and laughed like hell. OK, I admit there were times I wasn't sure just what was being said, but even when I missed a joke (accent or local reference) I still laughed. It's that good.",2015
10,"We just ""discovered"" this show on NetFlix two weeks ago and we are addicted to it! We have watched all the episodes on NetFlix and are watching them all again already. (Thank goodness for the subtitles because some of the slang we can't understand, haha.) Great actors, clever scripts, so funny! We just LOVE Victor, Jack and Winston!! This show is unique because it's funny and has genuine ""heart"". The cast is top notch and we truly care about them so when Jack is missing his wife or Jack and Victor go to visit Winston in his awful new apartment out of town, the viewers really care about these characters in their sad situations (this proves what great actors they are). There are too many great episodes to pick a favorite! So many lines from this hilarious TV series have crept into our every day language, like ""cheery-bye"" (haha). We love how they make reference to many famous American entertainers that we love (like Perry Como, Jack Lord, ""Quincy,"" Abbott & Costello, etc.) We are so excited to hear that they are filming a new season this summer although we don't know how long it will be until American viewers can see them. Unfortunately, we can't find the series on Region 1 or 0 even though we would love to own them on DVD. We love, love, love ""Still Game""! Thanks, NetFlix, for bringing this amazingly clever, creative, fun, unique show to American viewers! (This show is funnier than any new American TV shows/movies!)",2016
10,"Back in the days NBC's ""Golden Girls"" pioneered in discovering a fresh comedic potential according to the premise: Pensioners are also entitled to some post-prime fun before a career-move that involves pushing up the daisies. Especially when they're operating from Miami, Florida, of course. Now picture this as good old Sophia would say: How about we give the whole retiree idea more edge, relocate the girls to Scotland (complete with heavy accent), change their gender and language to something way stronger and offensive (yet in its own way endearing), and replace the picturesque Miami-scenario with fictional ""shitehole"" Craiglang ""somewhere near Glasgow"" with prospects being hee-haw as a Scot would say. You'll see: The fun refuses to concede defeat. Quite to the contrary. Welcome to ""Still Game""!",2017

10,"'Still Game' is to my mind the finest sitcom of the 21st Century. Like the earlier 'Rab C. Nesbitt', it originated from a sketch show which in this case was 'Chewin' The Fat'. Each week, the wily pensioners from Craiglang, played by Greg Hemphill and Ford Kiernan would show us how they fought to live another day.",2015
9,I have noticed that a few other reviews have been commenting on how people south of the border (the English) will not relate too or understand this Scottish comedy? However I am an Englishman living on the south coast of England (which is probably as far south as you can get from Scotland on mainland Britain) and I am an absolute Still Game fanatic! ,2012
10,"I think it is important to begin by stating that I was dubious about any show made since the influence of American television on the British Isles. But this is Scottish! Perhaps the independence of Scottish spirit buttresses their humour against the negative influence of U.S. productions. The writing is brilliant in the sense that, unlike American TV, little, if any, is predictable. The timing is spot on and the laugh tracks are in sync with the punchlines instead of used as a constant background. Witty is the best one word description I could use to entice others to give the show a chance. The visual expressions combine with subtlety to present the kind of humour I thought was lost on television. Sit back, put your feet up and enjoy television, once again.",2009
9,Having 'found' Still Game on BBC2 a couple of years ago it has consistently delivered great comedy. I was fortunate enough to be given the Series 1-5 on DVD at Christmas which has brought the opportunity to view the 'Scotland only' episodes. So many things explained..so many laughs I would not have had!,2008
10,Still Game is undoubtedly the comedy highlight of the week.,2007
10,"What is there to possibly say about this series other than ""utterly superb""!! This is the very best comedy series that I have ever seen. Everything about it from the settings, to the characters, to the script are just amazing. The show centres around Victor & Jack and the situations they get into along with the conversations that they have. Some of the shows can be quite moving but 95% is just 100% hilarious! From Victor & Jack's banter, to Winston's temper, to Isa's gossip. Everything just clicks together like nothing I have seen before. I never saw the characters in Chewing The Fat and my Dad bought my attention to this series. Everybody should give this show a chance and check it out. It really is that good! It puts more recent ""sitcoms"" such as My Family to shame. If all shows were this good I'd have no problem with paying my TV License every year. This is worth every penny!",2007
10,The funniest thing coming from the UK comedy world at the present time.,2006
10,"I'm a relative new comer to Still Game - have joined in watching the current Series (5) on BBC2, which ended it's run tonight. I find it to be an excellent show which doesn't take itself too seriously. The characters (Jack, Victor, Winston, Tam, etc) have lots of depth and are entirely believable in the way they approach life. As someone said in an earlier comment - these guys are 60/70 going on 20. It proves that when you become an older person, you don't have to become a miserable old so and so ! As an Englishman (and a Geordie) - I don't have any problem tying in with the Scottish SoH, and if people from 'down south' don't get the show, then that's their problem. Stick to your cockney rhyming slang on EastEnders.",2006
7,One of the main reasons why 'That '80s Show' was unsuccessful and short-lived is because it aired in the middle of That '70s Show's run. If it was released after That '70s Show ended then it probably would have done better.,2011
1,"Watching this show is like watching a very nasty train wreck - you want to look away yet you can't help but stare at the horror...  I think I've seen four episodes, and I hated every single one of them...  I TRIED to like it! I kept hoping the stupid piece of you-know-what would get better...  I didn't expect it to be that 70s show rehashed, but damn!  There's a REASON they have a laugh track on this show, you know - no live studio audience would stick around.  What gets me the most is the way they're trying REALLY REALLY FREAKING HARD to force a love plot with the main character and his overdone-punk co-worker.  You realize Corey and Tuesday are going to get together, and when they finally passionately kiss that laugh track is going to give a big ""WOOOOO!"" and I think I'm going to go to my basement and hang myself.  And while we're on the topic of Tuesday, I'm sorry, but I remember the 80s fairly well, and while mohawks were in, whatever the hell she's attempting to do with it was not (to be honest, I think that actress refused to shave the sides of her head in the name of her part so they had to think of something else).  I hate this show...  I hate myself for having wasted two hours of my life watching it.  The only people who could possibly like this show are the hopeless pre-teens who have nothing better to with with their time and don't really know the meaning of quality yet (we're all victims at that age; I remember Saved by the Bell all too well).  I'd rather sit and watch a loogie dry than to watch that 80s show ever again.",2002
5,"The team that brought us ""That '70s Show"" gives us ""That '80s Show"". It makes poetic sense if not in the real sense. They never understood that the audience wasn't watching it for the 70s style as much as for the group's chemistry. That show had fun which this one never achieved.",2013
7,"I just saw all 13 episodes of THAT 80S SHOW (2002) and it was MUCH better than advertised! I think the death knell for this show was obviously because the idea sprung from and it followed in the giant footsteps of the now-iconic That 70s Show, which was half-way through it's run when this new show premiered. T7S was probably right at it's peak of success with it's largest ratings and that's why the makers of T7S (some of which were behind T8S) thought this show would work. ",2012
6,"What made ""The 70's Show"" work so well was that the cast had almost instant chemistry. They also didn't try to make the characters anything special. They were just regular kids who hung out and got into regular kid trouble. No geniuses or super-jocks or anything else. Just regular kids (like the ones I used to hang out with in the 70's).",2010
8,"When i first heard That 80s show i thought it was just a rip off of That 70s show, but i was totally wrong. Don't get me wrong that 70s show is alright but that 80s show is sick as. The cast is brilliant. There is a good blend of different characters, which gives the show a good mix and if the show hadn't got canceled there was a lot of potential to work with. Roger is so funny, his dancing, his hair, Katie is silly and cute, Margret knows everything, Corey and Tuesday's(hot) relationship is a great angle. I just wish they will bring it back. Even Owen does funny stuff. Come on wake up people! This show is a class above. Bring it BACK! They always cancel the good shows. Every episode makes me laugh so hard that my stomach starts to hurt!",2003
7,"So many people have already written reviews of this movie, which has been out for five years now, that I am not going to go into detail about the plot, or the acting, or whether the storyline is predictable, or how cute Ty Posey was. I am merely going to say that I watched it tonight for the first time with my 13-year old daughter and we both enjoyed it immensely. I found Jennifer Lopez a bit stiff in places, but overall she handled the role well. I do not understand why so many people had problems with Ralph Finnes in this movie, I found him not only believable but incredibly sexy, and I hope he gets the opportunity to do more romantic comedies! Bob Hoskins stole every scene he was in. Stanley Tucci chewed scenery. Natasha Richardson was suitably selfish and blonde. New York was lovely. The dog overacted shamelessly. The movie was not perfect, but it was delightful. The only wrong note was the series of magazine covers at the end, showing what happened to the characters; it was much too ""cute"" and rather unbelievable (all three of her maid friends become hotel managers?) And I was rather disappointed that - for all the film's brave talk of crossing social barriers - the movie ends with nothing more than a magazine cover with the headline ""A year later, they are still together"". I felt cheated.",2007
10,"So you'll know where I'm coming from, some of my favorite movies are ""Parent Trap,"" ""Father of the Bride,"" ""Kate & Leopold.""  If you like these kinds of movies that leave you feeling good and happy about life, then you'll enjoy this tastefully done movie as well.  I could have done without a certain scene between the two, but this movie has a lot to offer, and has a moral to teach as well.  It has strong characters of positive principles, and there's even an ""older man mentor,"" like from ""Pretty Women,"" that adds that wholesome touch to the film.",2003
7,"This is a warm-heated story with a predictable plot. It may not be a great film, but but it is good entertainment. And the highlight of the movie may be hidden in a soliloquy, rather than revealed at the end. Every good story offers hope and this film delivers that. Its characters also experience transformation thanks to several easily-overlooked defining moments. So watch and enjoy the film for entertainment. Then watch it again, and again, for the pleasure of discovering the tapestry of truths it contains.",2010
5,Nice fantasy romance starring Jennifer Lopez that seems to rank high amongst her fans.,2011
8,"I just saw the movie and checked IMDb right away, where I found that this movie only had a score of 4.6 which I find to little. Why? There are some reasons. But first, when I watched this movie I knew always what was going to come, you can see in advance where the movie is going to. This is why I think the movie gets such low score. Unjust I feel, when you go to see this movie or rent it, I assume you know that it's a romantic movie? By the title of the movie you could very much assume that it's a feel good movie. So when you bring these 2 together you pretty much know what's gonna happen if you read the back of the movie box. Why rent it then? For it's purpose, it makes you feel good. Two people falling in love is always a nice thing and seeing how they cross boundary's for that love is even nicer. Thus I think that the movie succeeded in what he was made for. To give people the romance and the good feeling. Go see this movie with your girl/boyfriend if he or she doesn't dislike this kind of movies and sure you will feel happier about your own relationship as well. Because there is nothing heavy about this movie. That's what makes it so good in his genre. Do not watch this movie for super acting skills (although I do not dislike the acting). Do not go and see him for the directors special thricks to tell you things. Go see this movie for the romance and positive note and for sure you will not be disappointed.",2004
7,"So it's Cinderella. It's hard to imagine why that would bother anyone who'd seen the trailer, by the time you sit down to watch the movie you know the plot.",2010
10,"It might not be Oscar material, but it is a cute movie - so if you like Jennifer Lopez or wants to spend an evening on the sofa with your girlfriend, this movie is a good choice. Nice acting from all parts and a cool soundtrack with Norah Jones.",2003
2,"The story? Cliché, cliché, cliché, the umpteenth remake of Cinderella with not a single interesting addition. The script? Formula (and lame at that). The cast? Jennifer Lopez's turn as Cinderella/Sabrina proves she does not remotely belong to ""rags-to-Princess"" roles; she is galaxies away from Audrey Hepburn or Grace Kelly (or even ""Pretty Woman"" Julia Roberts), no matter how expensive the jewelry or costumes she wears. Ralph Fiennes seems to be on an O.D. of Prozac, with a perennial foolish smile on his face, wishing he were Cary (or even Hugh!) Grant -- shame to see a talented actor in such a puffy role. Natasha Richardson is wasted in the obligatory dumb blonde part, Stanley Tucci hams it up irritatingly, Bob Hoskins knows and shows his role is an embarrassment. On a less negative note, kid Tyler Posey is a real charmer, and manages to survive his ""cutie"" part. The direction? Well, no doubt Wayne Wang is a professional and I hope he was paid a LOT of money to lend his prestigious name to this fluffy cake - I only wish the word ""professionalism"" were taken more seriously, as in ""professional integrity""...Where is the Wayne Wang that directed the surrealistic ""Life is Cheap...But Toilet Paper is Expensive"" and the cool ""Smoke""? ",2004
1,"Somebody brought the DVD. After the movie was over, nobody would own up as to who had the brilliant idea. Well Wayne Wang, remember ""Smoke""? Ralph Finnes for heaven's sake, a very particular actor, very choosy or so I hear and Jennifer Lopez in the hands of a good director can deliver, remember ""Out of Sight""? No. The movie seems written by people who've never seen a Preston Sturges or a Billy Wilder movie. It is a sub TV movie of the week. Even Bob Hoskins playing the Hector Elizondo part of ""Pretty Woman"" can't save the day. Only Natasha Richardson in an all out performance managed to make me smile. There was a time in Hollywood, not so long ago, when you could get a film made if you had Steve Guttenberg in it. Jennifer Lopez is the Steve Guttenberg of the new millennium. I don't understand how something so thoughtless, tasteless and utterly un-redeeming could get made in Manhattan, Hollywood or anywhere else. Somebody should tell Jennifer Lopez that she's not Audrey Hepburn or Jean Arthur. There is a sort of hardness about her that makes her anti-romantic. Her wardrobe as the Maid of the title is utterly insane. As is every attempt at sincerity. I'm sure Jennifer Lopez has talent but not certainly for romantic comedies. She keeps making them though. I bet she would be great in steamy melodramas. I would cast Miss. Lopez in the Bette Davis part in a remake of ""Beyond the Forest""",2005
2,"So, let's see. A hotel maid meets a candidate for the Senate, except that she's all fancied up when she meets him so he doesn't know she's a maid - he thinks she's some rich socialite - and they fall in love until reality comes crashing in. Sounds like Cinderella. There's even some folk cast in the wicked stepmother role, except in this case it's the wicked hotel guest (Natasha Richardson) whose identity Marisa the maid (Jennifer Lopez) steals.",2003
8,I remember seeing this in the cinemas back in 2002 and my mom dragged me to see it. I of course thought that it was going to be so stupid but I decided to check it out. I also recorded in on VHS a few years back and I saw it on TV loads of times. Its about a single parent(maybe divorced) who has an adorable son named Ty(this reminds me of that 2007 film Enchanted with its cute frothy plot and the single parent in love with a dude who has a high up job).,2010
8,"The thing that attract people to watch this movie is the movie trailer. They make a very good and detail trailer. And the thing that make people very curious about this movie is the last word that the narrator said in the trailer,""No matter who you are the destiny will find you."" That words makes the story heard so extraordinary.And also it could make the other people believe on their wish. ",2007
6,"I actually thought this film wasn't bad. It wasn't a masterpiece, but then again I don't think it ever had aspirations to be.",2007
1,"It is really not necessary to see this Lopez flick if you have seen any one of her other movies! She doesn't play characters similar to one another, she plays the SAME character in all of her films. Poor struggling girl meets handsome rich guy while she pretends to be someone she is not. Rich guy finds out the truth but doesn't care that he was deceived because of course HE LOVES HER(YAWN)! Ralph Fiennes is believable as the rich handsome politician because unlike Lopez, he can actually ACT! The only people I would recommend this movie to are Jennifer Lopez fans only because of the fact that they obviously don't mind that she can't sing, so they will not care that she can't act either!",2005
1,"I saw this film on a sneak preview and although I was understanding that this them had been done over and over and over again, I still went to see it? Why? I like Ralph Finnes, and I was hoping that Jennifer Lopez had a film that was good enough for her. Well, I still like Ralph Finnes, and I am still waiting for a film that is worthy of Jennifer Lopez's talents. If film makers are going to take a ""Cinderella"" story and remake it, redo it, reshow it for the upmteenth time, at least be somewhat creative.",2002
1,Whatever possessed Ralph Fiennes to star in this movie is beyond me!,2002
6,"This wasn't one of my favorite movies, but I wouldn't mind watching it again. I am glad I didn't pay for it!! I thought JLo wasn't as bad in this as she has been in others. She actually did a great job of portraying ""real"" emotion as a single mother. (which wouldn't be too easy for her considering she doesn't have any kids) But she didn't seem to even like Ralph in the movie let alone ""love"" him.",2004
1,The answer is pile o' crap! It's the tallest pile of crap to come along since Runaway Bride. J-Lo is the new Julia! Yes that's right. We have a new most annoying female in Hollywood. I am pretty sure this movie was written by Harry and Lloyd. I give it a negative nine out of positive ten.,2003
5,"I rented Maid in Manhattan the other day and watched it last night, but before I had watched it, I looked at the rating on IMDb and I saw the low rating and I was like ""Oh, no, I've picked another bad movie"". I don't know why I wanted to see this movie, just I figured I needed a romantic comedy in my selection, so I just grabbed it and even after that rating I thought this was going to be a bad movie. But as it turns out this really wasn't a bad movie at all. Yeah, it has minor flaws here and there, this isn't movie of the year, but over all I would say that it was pretty cute.",2007
7,"I think this movie is underrated. This one is no masterpiece in film making, but if like romantic movies in general you'll like it. It is a new Cinderella story, if you like: The Maid meets the Politician who fells in love with her - because he's mistaking her for a hotel guest. The Maid thinks he only likes her because she's rich - not for herself. Will they come together? Happy End Guaranteed... Jennifer Lopez and Ralph Fiennes are good headliners for this movie. All other Actors - including Bob Hoskins in a supporting role - do a good job. In its Genre I'll give this movie 7 out of 10.",2004
1,"The Republican aristocracy romances the immigrant working-class in this glossy Cinderella tale; the result seems to be a draw (they'd rather vote for Arnold). The script is so crass and calculated that it includes a cute precocious kid AND a dog. It is mainlined straight to naive young women, its target audience. Top English actors are used in all the roles requiring ""class"", which is amusing; no doubt they were chuckling all the way to the bank. Note also that pretty much all of the other lead actors are about 10 years older than J-Lo, the purpose of which is probably to make her seem younger than she actually is (about 32 at time of filming). As other reviewers have pointed out, this is a ""romantic comedy"" which contains no romance or comedy - unless you count the lame ""oops I almost sat on your face"" line - yuk yuk yuk. There is about as much chemistry between J-Lo and Fiennes as between Minnie Mouse and Donald Duck. Its not the worst film that Fiennes has done (think ""Avengers"") but its close!",2003
6,"Was Jennifer Lopez going through an ""I want to be Julia Roberts"" phase in 2002? That was the year in which she made ""Enough"", a shameless rip-off of ""Sleeping with the Enemy"" and followed it up with ""Maid in Manhattan"", which bears a certain resemblance to another Roberts film, ""Pretty Woman"".",2009
7,"There's something refreshingly sincere about this movie. The lead actors seem to have a genuine connection. The lack of awkwardness Lopez's character displays as she tries to fit into high-society perhaps is not quite realistic; she seems to be able to transition back and forth a bit too easily. But realism, which seems to be the stylistic fad these days, especially among snobby ""high-art"" movie ... ahem ... FILM goers, is not really the point here. To criticize the movie on those aspects would be silly (just as silly as it would be criticize Cinderella on those grounds ... and it isn't pumpkin carriages that I'm talking about).",2005
10,"Anyone who finds pornography disturbing will find ""Ken Park"" disturbing for both the wrong and the right reasons. ",2004

1,"It takes a special kind of genius to make group sex, incest, suicide, and murder quite this dull. That genius is Larry Clark. Overwhelmed by exactly the fragmentary voyeurism that is the essence of his photography, Clark is seemingly unwilling or unable to extend any of the sensational moments he films far enough into either the past or the future to give them meaning; they remain instead iconic snapshots of Clark's private sexual obsessions. This means that while Clark is clearly very excited to pose his actors, he doesn't trouble at all with their characters, and this fixation on a physical presence (specifically of willing young men) that the viewer can't access becomes a black hole at the movie's centre.",2006
7,"**********SPOILERS************ This is an acted documentary, as it puts unrelated characters next to each other (Ken Park, Tate). If you watch the movie from that angle, it becomes less over-the-top, as I really felt it was trying to put EVERY possible teenage drama (suicide, incest, sexual abuse, killing grandparents (!!)) into one movie. Apart from that it was all a bit much I really liked the style of the movie, the characters and the plots on their own. In any case a movie worth watching.",2004
1,"Considering I grew up in Visalia, and spent much of my youth at the skate park featured at the beginning of the film, I can attest there is plenty of realism in this film. Our society is deeply troubled, and maybe YOU don't see things like this every day, but I certainly have. In fact, just this week one of the locals that starred in this film came to my friend's house in the middle of the night spun out of his gourd on meth. It would have fit perfectly as a scene in this film.",2010

Shocking, gripping, honest, mature, in-your-face. ""Ken Park"" is the first film made that takes us into the world of American families to show us what really goes on. Life is not all sweet and charming even though we might wish it to be. Movies don't have to be sappy and happy. There don't have to be car chases and killings, cops and good-guys and bad-guys. To those viewers raised on soap operas and ""Friends"", turn away because you won't find this film funny.",2005

1,"Ugh, I should have known better...Ken Park - the third installment in Clark's portraits of teenage alienation - is even worse than Kids and Bully. This guy deserves his status and reputation of artistic film-maker as much as I deserve the Nobel peace-price. I hope, when all the hype cools down, more and more people will realize that he's nothing more than an untalented and dull cineast who's only out to shock audiences. When watching his films, I get the idea that his only goal is to get banned and censored in as much countries as humanly possible...because that provides him with an easily deserved cult reputation. The story and especially the characters in Ken Park are pathetic, uninspired, empty and not at all that offensive... And this film is completely arrogant and egocentric. You can actually hear Larry Clark thinking: ""Oh, look at me...I'm controversial"". Bah, how pitiful. There's nothing artistic about explicit and outrageous sex scenes (read: semi-pornographically scenes)! When I first saw this film - at a festival - the public spontaneously started to applaud at the close up of a masturbation sequence...Why, why...WHY, I ask?!? If things like masturbation, sodomy and incest can be considered 'artistic', then why is everybody embarrassed to admit they watch porno? Ken Park is a soporific and utterly annoying anthology that unites a couple of messed up teenagers (and their even more messed up parents) you don't care about to begin with, anyway. I surely hope your VCR-player has a fast-forward button! Yet, the most hilarious statement I keep hearing is that Larry Clark movies are eye-openers and realistic portraits of society nowadays...What a load of nonsense is that? Life isn't like this and surely people aren't as stupid and depressing as Clark pictures them. And if you think they are, you should go out more...or at least start to watch better movies.",2004
2,"I'm beginning to think that Larry Clark cares more about ""pushing the envelope"" by depicting exponentially more and more gratuitous teenage sex with each of his films than he does about ensuring any realistic plot. This was yet another in a string of pointless 'those crazy kids!' flicks where we get to (oh joy!) follow around a bunch of vacant teen miscreants on their outrageous, totally unbelievable sex and drug-fueled adventures. Even if you're very, very creative and desperate to find a message or lesson to be learned from this contrived bit of garbage, I'm afraid you're still going to be somewhat disappointed.",2009

It's like the whole idea of making this film is a novelty, it's just random scenes with virtually no story. Hey look sex! We've never seen that before! Wow! Shocking? Naw. Shockingly boring. There's zero character development so you don't really care about any of the characters, at least I didn't. Every scene seemed pointless. There was no drive, things were just happening. People said it pushes the envelope, but take all those ""shocking"" scenes out and you have nothing. There's no substance. Just play GTA if you want shocking scenes. Kids was much better, at least they had personality. But ""shocking"" without substance doesn't cut it. 1/10 and that's being generous.",2003

Well this movie has changed my attitude about wanting to see banned movies. Wouldn't put this movie on the shelf with the worst porn has to offer. It pretends it's actually saying something deep and meaningful and I even get the feeling that those involved believe this to be true. Which is frankly sadder then this movie. I'm sure this film will have it's few Robotic Elitists defending it zealously.

But really, haven't we all seen it before, in a softer (and much better) way precisely on Larry Clark's ""Kids""? I can acknowledge that there was an effort of putting morality together in this one, but really, what comes out even for an attentive spectator is that this movie ends up pushing the limits too much, and becomes boring at it. The result is another shock movie, another art house hardcore piece, that, to me, didn't stick too much. Clearly, more gratuitous than mind-bending. Give us a story instead.",2004

The day he breaks his own rules, he realizes he is transporting a Chinese girl, Lai (Qi Shu), and he gets in many troubles due to his fault. This movie is pure action having all the usual clichés: car chasing, explosions, fights when nobody uses guns, the lead actor gets some kind of involvement with the victim etc. But the choreography is excellent and the action scenes are great.

A film that basically came out of nowhere and helped secure Jason Statham's reputation as being the hardest Englishman in the business (Vinnie Jones? Please!) and one of the most popular actors in America. Its pure adrenaline from the first car case, right through to the homo-erotic but brilliantly choreographed oil fight. Statham's no Tom Hanks in the acting stakes - but then he is not required to be. He's required to look hard as nails and run, jump and punch a lot. Which he does - a lot. The biggest let down of the film was the weak ending. You know that the girl will save his life and kill her father, you know it - but you really don't want it to happen and when it does, well - lets just say that every time i watch the ending I want to throw the TV out the window. Anyway - pure blokes film, great fights, great stunts, cars, guns, sexy woman and it may never win any awards for best screenplay, but that doesn't mean its not worth checking out.

If you like completely mindless movies that don't even try to come up with an intriguing or original plot, realistic characters, believable dialog, suspense, emotion, etc., etc., but are only looking for a fast paced succession of action and martial arts sequences, then this is your movie! And guys, don't even think about bringing your girlfriends along unless they're madly in love with Jason Statham (who could in fact play better roles than this one here). This movie is dumb with a capital ""D"" and only slightly entertaining for us explosion loving fanboys with the minds of 10 year olds. Hell, even with the mind of a 10 year old you'll still be hard pressed to overlook the stupidity of this script.

1,"It's been a little while since I've seen this movie, but I can not bring myself to watch this ""movie"" ever again. When I went to see this movie, I was expecting a nice Ronin-esque like action flick. Especially considering I'm a huge fan of Jason Statham, and all the previous movies he has done. Instead I've got a poorly thrown together clichés and scenes with absolutely no point. The lead female character barely speaks English (they TRY to explain this fact in the movie), and needs to spend much more time in acting school. That probably goes for at least half of the actors in the film. The soundtrack is horrific. The music in and of itself is great, however it seems as in the sounds somehow were mixed up and the wrong music was played at the wrong scene. There are times where techno is playing during a slow scene, and a nice slow song plays during an action sequence. The dialogue is forced, the story is cliché, and nothing whatsoever stands out from this movie to write about. The only decent scene was the car chase at the beginning of the movie and the fight scene between Jason and the many villains in the warehouse. It did manage to show off Jason's potential as an action hero, as well as had some creative fighting moves. However, this movie has nothing to offer. The same action can be seen in different, and much better films. Avoid this as you would the Black Plague.",2004
1,The Transporter takes everything that's bad about action movies and combines them into possibly the worst 90 minutes of film I have ever seen.  This film is a complete joke and insults the intelligence of anyone who watches it.,2003
2,"THE TRANSPORTER is a schintzy action movie with nothing notable about it except for two things: first, its non-acting star, Jason Statham, who, even though he seems to have the right moves to become the next Jean Claude, looks more like a concentration camp survivor than anything else. And second, the ending, which, remarkably, is an almost scene by scene copy of the ending in the James Bond flick, LICENCE TO KILL. I mean, there are homages and then there are ripoffs, and the ending in THE TRANSPORTER is a total ripoff of the ending in the 007 movie. It's unreal. I'm surprised Brocoli corp & MGM/UA didn't sue.

Once you find out what the movies all about it kind of ruins the cool tone it had to it originally. The plot itself is not only bad, but is thrown together, making for a really patchy film. The action is great - but that's all. Even at some points its absolutely ridiculous what is pulled off. I found myself laughing at a few parts.

Definitely an original take on Man vs Dragon. Now to get this straight, this is a film about Humans, not about Dragons. The dragons merely supply the unique reason for the apocalypse. This is a film about the post-apocalypse, not the apocalypse. It's not about skies full of Dragons turning worldwide armed forces into ash on an epic scale. It's not about Dragons setting the world, quite literally, on fire. It's about after all that's happened.",2009

There was no nonsense, no tongue-in-cheek humor or special-effects just for the sake of it: this was simply a humans vs. dragons story taking place in the future.

It's a 'post-apocalypse' story where mankind is reduced to living an almost stone-age existence by a global disaster, but this time the apocalypse is brought about not by nuclear weapons but a race of dragons unleashed from the depths of the earth by over-ambitious mining! OK, it's a pretty silly concept, but the whole thing is handled with panache. Director Rob (X-Files) Bowman is obviously at home with this kind of subject matter and the visuals are excellent thanks to cinematographer Adrian Biddel, a dab hand at photographing the impossible thanks to his work on the two Mummy films and The World Is Not Enough. Critics here in the UK panned it when it came out, saying that it needed more special effects, but they completely missed out on the charm of the film, which was in the ingenious ways that it showed the human race had been changed by the onset of the dragons. I loved the scene where Quinn and his sidekick, having to entertain a castle full of children without the benefit of TV or video games, enact a scene from Star Wars, providing both dialogue and narration as they go.",2003

This film tells a great story about the human race becoming refugees and fighting the force that dominated them.  The characters were played very well, they were hard people living in hard times.  The children added perspective and even hope that humans could outlast the beasts.  The visual effects are stunning, from the dragons to the wasteland the film has a dark beauty.  The plot is survival of the fittest, and only one species will survive.",2003

Giving a scientific edge to a creature based in fantasy, this film proved to be a rather refreshing step in science fiction, which means it won't be a well received one. Even if this film barely makes its money back, at least it leaves the door open for other fantastic ideas in the science fiction genre. ",2002

Unfortunately, that summer of 2002 all anyone could think about was the over hyped debut of ""spider man."" Such a shame, because this film beats it by a mile in terms of imagination on display.

A million times better than I thought it would be.  It was scary, it was intense, it was touching, and it gave one of the funniest nods to our culture i've ever seen.  A long time ago wars seperated men and ruined cities.  They grabbed the bible as a link to each other, and to their past, with it's legend, and lore and dogma.  Of course in our day and age, the survivors would probably worship harry potter instead of jesus.  Sorry for rambling, but i thought they're cultural religion and storytelling was great.",2002

The acting was good, suspense was kept high by not having too many dragons all the time and it just becoming a shoot-em-up, and the special effects were awesome - the scene at the end of the movie where Christian Bale is lifted off the ground by impact (I won't spoil it for anyone by saying why) was just fantastic and worth the admission money alone! Apart from the movie it was fun star-spotting, seeing David Duchovny and the other guy off the X-Files/Terminator 2 (can never remember his name), David Arquette and Christian and other members of the cast.

His knack for accents is amazing, and even though he speaks in what I'm assuming is his original English accent, its a trip to see him sound different in every movie with none of the embarrassing attributes that Leonardo DiCaprio brings. Matthew McConaughey was honestly a big surprise, pulling off the role of a bad ass very well. I actually didn't even realize it was him until I saw the cast listing here on IMDb and went back to check because I couldn't believe it.",2007

The film centers on a group of refugees led by Quinn (Christian Bale). The refugees live quiet lives in their mountain homes always on the watch for dragons. Things are stirred up, however, when an American group of marauders led by Van Zan (Matthew McConaughey). Van Zan quarrel quite a bit before they realize that only one species is going to survive this apocalypse so they'll have to band together if they want to survive.

It is a clever, refreshing, new point of view of the human fear of dragons. A constant futuristic, dark feeling, struggle of the heroes for survival, while at the same time the viewer gets this suspicion that each hero hides a dragon inside, fighting his/her own demons. All thumbs up for all the actors in the film and a pat in the back for the director (he also directed the X-Files).

I am a big Sandra Bullock fan, and she is effective here as forensic detective Cassie Mayweather, who is not very likable and a broken person too. However, there is a sense of detachment inherent in the story structure. It's about the perfect murder executed by two spoiled sociopath teenagers, Richard (Ryan Gusling) who is the cool one, and Justin ( Michael Pitt) who is the sympathetic geek. Basically, Richard and Justin kill a young woman, because they have nothing better to do on a school night. They are very smart and very arrogant which is normally not a bad thing, but it just doesn't work here. Tony Gayton's script does a great job of detailing the investigation of a puzzling murder, and it is truly by the numbers. We have these two punk kids flaunting their superiority, and we just want them to take a fall. ",2002

3,"There's something frustrating about watching a movie like 'Murder By Numers' because somewhere inside that Hollywood formula is a good movie trying to pop out. However, by the time the credits roll, there's no saving it. The whole thing is pretty much blown by the ""cop side"" of the story, where Sandra Bullock and Ben Chaplin's homicide detective characters muddle through an awkward sexual affair that becomes more and more trivialized the longer the movie goes on. Although Bullock is strong in her role, it's not enough to save the lackluster script and lazy pacing. Ben Chaplin's talents are wasted in a forgettable role (he did much better earlier in the year in the underrated 'Birthday Girl') as well as Chris Penn, who has a role so thanklessly small you feel sorry for a talent like him. Anyway, the plot really isn't even a factor in this movie at all. The two teen killers played by Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt are the only real reasons to see this movie. Their talent and chemistry work pretty good and they play off of each other quite well. It's too bad they weren't in a much better all-around film. Barbet Schroeder is treading way too safe ground here for such a seasoned filmmaker. Bottom Line: it's worth a rent if you're a genre fan, but everyone else will live a fulfilled life without ever seeing it, except maybe on network TV with convenient commercial breaks.",2002
6,"It's a swell thriller: a reasonably sophisticated plot, with some neat twists and turns, good camera work, and a kind of satisfactory ending. But just as with the murder story in question, the flaws become apparent at closer examination.",2003

9,"I can get very tired of murder mysteries with the exception of a few really excellent TV series. Otherwise, there are just too many of these murder plot themes. I don't like the theme of the two over-clever, selfish youths killing as an intellectual exercise, I've no interest whatsoever in Hitchcock who appears to have been associated with this in some way I don't intend to find out about. But don't misunderstand me, the theme is in itself excellent, the whole movie is so well done, and of course Sandra Bullock is superlative as always. ",2009

8,"A random murder, a secret friendship and a detective with an attitude problem are just three of the interesting ingredients of this absorbing psychological thriller. ""Murder By Numbers"" entertains and intrigues its audience, not by posing the question ""who did it?"" but instead by following the progress of a detective's search for the evidence she needs to support her theory about who was responsible for committing a brutal murder. The fact that her task is made more difficult by her personal demons, her clever adversaries and obstacles created by her superiors, only makes things more difficult and adds to the story's already tense atmosphere.",2014
8,"I almost didn't watch Murder By Numbers, for two reasons. First, I'm not the biggest Sandra Bullock fan, but second and more importantly, the trailer does not do the movie justice at all. In fact, I would advise against watching the trailer, because it will almost destroy all interest in watching the movie, like it did to me. The problem is that the trailer gives the impression that Murder By Numbers is a murder mystery with no mystery, because it is obvious from the start that there is no question as to who the murderers are. It leaves you with the feeling that if you watch the preview, you've seen the movie. Kind of like what happened with Pleasantville.",2005
1,Can some one tell me the point of this film!!??!?,2003
2,"So, I'm wondering while watching this film, did the producers of this movie get to save money on Sandra Bullock's wardrobe by dragging out her ""before"" clothes from Miss Congeniality? Did Ms. Bullock also get to sleepwalk through the role by channeling the ""before"" Gracie Hart? As many reviewers have noted before, the film is very formulaic. Add to that the deja vu viewer experiences with the character of Cassie Maywether as a somewhat darker Gracie Hart with more back story and it rapidly become a snooze fest.",2009
10,"Greatly enjoyed this film starring Sandra Bullock,(Casie Mayweather),""Two Weeks Notice"",'02, who was a mixed up police detective who had some very deep dark secrets in her past and managed to show these weakness to her co-workers. Ben Chaplin,(Sam Kennedy),""Lost Souls"",'2000, was Casie's partner and had a very hard time trying to keep her in line with their investigation and her personality flare ups with Ryan Gosling,(Richie Haywood),""The Believer"",'01. Richie Haywood and Michael Pitt,(Justin Pendleton),""Bully"",'01, were very good friends who had families that paid very little attention to them. Richie & Justin decided to do just about anything they wanted and were both very sick mentally. This was a very entertaining film and it is easy to be critical about this film which never was intended to win an Academy Award. Sandra Bullock held this picture together, however, Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt both showed great acting abilities and I am quite sure these two actors will become greater stars in the future.",2005
5,"slowest moving film I've seen in a long time. Include this with the fact it's basically boring (especially Sandra Bullock) throughout, and you've got a film that starts out with lot's of potential, but drags along with plot holes that are so evident...it's a ""crime"" in itself. The two boys in the film do a great job though..and make up for Sandra Bullock's obviously ""over the top"" acting as the ""tough guy"" female detective. If it wasn't for the two adolesent plotters...this movie wouldn't of even attained the 5 rating I gave it.",2002
6,"The film is enough interesting , though we know who's the killer , the surprises don't fade . The starring Sandra Bullock and Ben Chaplin try to investigate the woman's murder . It isn't a spoiler to say who's the assassin because since the first frame we understand the reasons and persons execute it .",2004
3,"Having been pleasantly surprised by Sandra Bullock's performance in Miss Congeniality, I decided to give Murder By Numbers a shot.  While decent in plucky, self-effacing roles, Ms. Bullock's performance in ""serious"" roles (see Hope Floats, Speed 2, 28 Days) leave much to be desired.  Her character is at the same time omniscient, confused, and sexually maladjusted (the sub-plot of Sandra's past comes across as needless filler that does little to develop her already shallow character).  The two teenage boys gave decent performances, although their forensics expertise and catch-me-if-can attitude is belied by stupid errors that scream ""We did it!""  Chris Penn as the all-too-obvious suspect is wasted here, as is Ben Chaplin's token partner/love interest character.",2002
1,I saw Murder by Numbers last night at a free advance screening to college students on the campus of Kent State.  I think the studio is hoping to generate buzz among 18-25 yr olds by showing it free.  Unfortunately it was a complete waste of time.  Every cliche used in better movies is utilized from the angry police chief to the detective(Bullock) who know's the true killer's identity but no one believes her.  It's almost as if the writers of this started with an interesting script and then slowly wrote them selves into a corner as the movie progressed.  If you're like me you'll find yourself hoping against hope for a surprise twist at the end but don't hold you're breath.  There is none.  Add this movie to Bullock's impressive resume of Speed 2 and Love Potion #9.  Don't waste your time or money.,2002
8,"""Murder by Numbers"" stars Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt as two rebellious high schoolers who are content on the perfect murder for the sake of overcoming their shattered self-esteem. Sandra Bullock plays the heroic thorn in the way of their plans as Det. Cassie Mayweather. This is nowhere near the traditional finger-pointing murder mystery as the film graciously reveals the killers to us (Gosling and Pitt). What the film does instead is concentrate on the purposes of their killings and if they have what it takes to commit the perfect murder. ",2009
9,"Some reviewers have suggested that the storyline of this movie is a bit plodding and portentous, and I'd be willing to allow that. But even if this film had absolutely no plot to speak of, I would have considered the money I plunked down yesterday to see ""Hero"" to be money well-spent, because I have been witness to some of the most achingly beautiful film-making I've ever seen. As in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" the characters here fly through the air and dance across water, but ""Crouching Tiger"" surely could have benefited from the sublime camera eye of ""Hero."" One scene of swordplay in particular that takes place in a grove of trees amongst swirling yellow leaves almost stopped my heart in my chest: It was that gorgeous. And yes, there is a plot also, one that involves various assassins with names like Sky, and Broken Sword, and Flying Snow. I have to admit that the tales and counter-tales told were a bit confusing at first, but by the time the film is over, all the pieces have fallen into place, and this chapter of ancient Chinese history has assumed a truly mythical quality. At a time when movie theaters show a lot of utter dreck, we ought to be supporting movies like this.",2004
10,Hero is noteworthy on at least two counts.,2005
10,"Rarely have I been so astounded by such a magnificent, awe-inspiring film. If you have not yet placed your eyes on this masterpiece of Chinese cinema then I cannot recommend this film highly enough. 'Hero' is by far the best Chinese film I have ever seen, and already a firm favourite of all time.",2004
9,"While i enjoyed this movie very much, i believe Hero will get the kinds of reviews and responses that Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon (CTHD) did, and still does, ie. either you liked it very much, or you couldn't see what the fuss was all about.  This dichotomy of opinions makes for interesting study because it seems to cut across cultural and intellectual differences. Everywhere the film is shown, there will a segment of the audience that will love and rave about it, and another segment that will be wondering if they had been watching the same movie.  I can't explain why this is so, but i suspect it has a lot to do with a viewer's initial expectation of the movie, and then his perception and appreciation of the nuances in the telling of the storyline.",2003
7,"After two years of hearing about the myth of the most expensive Chinese film ever made, Hero has finally floated on to British cinema screens. As it flies, it trails a coloured cloth that carries the film's numerous morals and messages which descend upon you like a soft layer of fabric. This is a film that can lift your spirits and have you laughing out in sheer joy as you gaze in wonder at the perfection of the mise-en-scene and cinematography. That is, if you let the film take you on a journey, without pondering the films questionable plot points.",2004
9,"Before I give my review, let me offer one suggestion that will help you appreciate this film. DO NOT SEE IT JUST ONCE. Watch it twice and then pass judgment. The film is so visually and artistically captivating that the plot can be harder to grasp the first time around. The second time around you'll get a better appreciation for the film.",2004
9,"It sounded like a HK Cinema fan's ultimate wet dream... Zhang Yimou to direct a martial arts epic with Jet Li, Maggie Cheung, Leung Chiu Wai, Zhang Ziyi and Donnie Yen in the cast, Ching Siu-Tung doing the action, Christopher Doyle the cinematography and Emil Wada the costumes. What more could you ask for? (Well, Brigitte Lin coming out of retirement and Yuen Wo Ping and Sammo Hung sharing the action director credits, perhaps).",2003
8,"After two viewings, I am still not sure what to make of this film, story-wise. I have no problems exalting praise for the cinematography which, for many people, was the drawing point. It's what got me to watch the movie. I had heard it was the most beautiful film ever made. Well, I wouldn't go that far, but it IS visually spectacular. It's even more appreciated now that I watched one of the documentaries in which I learned to what great lengths director Yimou Zhang the crew went to, to make this look so good. It took a lot of patience, waiting for just the right conditions, such as the smooth, silvery lake which only was calm two hours a day.",2006

7,"In all honesty, Hero required a bit more patience than I thought. Tarantino wanted to present this movie to North American audiences so I thought there would have been more action, but surprise! There is much drama in Hero and the movie begins with one intention and unfolds, in a deceptively beautiful fashion, into a legend that is much larger than the characters themselves are involved! Why did it have to take so long to prove such a point?",2004
9,"Now I'm not as into foreign films as I should be, and this one really makes me ashamed of not paying more attention to them. The story-telling in this movie is so vivid and poetic that you cannot help but love every single second of every single story that is told. The Character Sky represents strategy and cunning, Broken Sword represents rationale and understanding whereas Flying Snow is hatred and revenge. Nameless (Jet Li) encounters all of these characters and embodies all of their aspects.",2013
10,"Great fighting...but you should first understand the historical background. Takes place in of the most interesting time periods. Throughout the years people of told numerous stories of assassination attempts on the great Emperor Qing. This one is by far the most dramatic, action packed of all. This movie has a wonderful plot that will leave you in shock! All the characters come to life with the wonderful acting of the actors. Zhang, the master at creating martial arts classics delivers us his best work of Hero. The movie is flawless combined with amazing soundtracks. Hero is definitely Jet Li's best performance. Don't miss out on the story of an ancient empire that once rocked the world!",2005

I'm really surprised with the use of the colors, the camera, the clean, precious effects and, of course, with the the smart, great story... I want to emphasize this: is too hard to understand the hole plot? Because I have been surprised with anger comments (few, God thanks) talking about physic laws, communism and stuff like that!! Did those guys realize the phrase ""They fight first with their minds"", before some of the most astonishing battles? I feel sad about the poor intelligence and interest of our people, specially when is the turn of a tremendous big country: China.",2005
9,"According to Robert Mackey's interview with Christopher Doyle (the cinematographer of Hero) which was pubished in the New York Times, the choice of colors for the film ""Hero"" was aesthetic, not symbolic. However, as viewers, we are bound to create our own meanings for the color choices based on the emotion and mood of the scene. Here are the few reasons I thought of to explain each color choice. Red was used in the first version of the story wherein Broken Sword and Flying Snow are portrayed as foolish lovers ruled by jealousy and anger. Red may have been used to emphasize the furious passion between the couple. Blue was used in the Emperor's version of the story. It complemented the subdued, more rational re-telling. Blue brings to mind ""calmness"" which can be used to describe the King's version as well. Blue also highlighted the gloominess evoked in the scene wherein Nameless and Broken Sword grieve for Flying Snow through a sword fight. White was used in the final version of the story which was the true version. White usually connotes purity so it is a good choice of color for the true version which is untainted, uncolored. White, a color associated with death and mourning in Asian culture, also foreshadowed the death of the key characters.",2005

When I saw Insurrection, I thought it was a decent movie but certainly a huge drop from First Contact. I simply assumed that the next film would be better, as has been the pattern with Star Trek films. Now after seeing Nemesis, Insurrection is magnificent by comparison. The problem with this film is there's no passion, and it shows in the whole production. The writer-director team seem to have aimed very, very low. The filmmakers were just trying to make a little self-enclosed film without any substance. The most potential is at the end of a saga, where you can put anything and everything at stake. Instead, the writer just rewrote Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan for the TNG cast, and by his own admission to boot! The people who currently control the franchise have no interest in creating a bold, emotional or epic story. At this point, they are mindlessly cranking out material simply to continue the franchise.",2004
1,"Let me state, for the record, that I have loved Star Trek for most of my life. ""The Next Generation"" is still one of my favorite TV shows, thanks to enduring cable exposure. Traditionally, the ST films alternate good/bad. Star Trek II, IV, VI, and First Contact were very good, but parts I, III, V, Generations and Insurrection were not that good, with part V being the outright worst outing ever. Logically, this meant Nemesis should have been an upswing. Sadly, it is mediocre at best, which in my opinion sounds the death knell for Star Trek.",2002
1,"I find it tragic that people could actually find something good to say about this movie. I have the entire collection of Star Trek and not only was this a bad movie it would even rank as the worst of all the episodes including the Star Trek Enterprise Pilot... and that is just sad. The one certainty that has always been part of the legend of the Star Trek Universe is character continuity. When Warf's character reached fulfillment on Star Trek DS9, for example, he was a Federation Ambassador...suddenly in Nemesis he is back on the Enterprise as a Lt Commander (having already made Commander on DS9) without explanation. Wesley Crusher was ""A Traveller"" able to reach through the confines of time and space which also includes weddings apparently. He could have gone on board Enterprise and had them on Remus in about a second yet no mention was made of his powers, abilities or relationships. We are to believe that Picard's Nemesis was Picard...too bad Locutus was not around to hear that or he would have been upset. The cheap Chinese copy of Picard was sickly and yet infinitely more powerful than the original who rose to Captain in the Federation. The Federation's ultimate enemy from Kirk to Picard was the Romulans...Vulcan's with attitude who were to sly what Vulcan's are to logic. Apparently the only thing the Federation had to do to destroy them all this time was send Picard with a smart bomb. The thousands of worlds they conquered must have been shocked that one guy, Picard with Hair, could destroy and entire Empire in a few minutes and then set his sights on the Federation. We apparently were supposed to forget that Spock, the legendary ambassador to Romulus after years of infiltrating the Romulan society with his teachings of logic had ultimately failed....and what Romulans really wanted was a human to lead them. I don't think so. Star Trek was never about space travel it was about people and how they lived on the edge of a new reality...a new frontier. These people are heroic figures to the show's fans and cant be belittled or downplayed because as it affects the show's characters it effects us as the loyal audience. Just as Star Trek Entrprise tried to create Vulcan's as an enemy; Romulous being taken over in a day just does not fly with an audience loyal to the traditions of a future we want and love. We want men of logic and learning to help us traverse the frontier and we want enemies that we could never really best before to be more formidable than surrendering to Picard with hair. Visually it was an interesting movie with special effects that wow the eye. Data spacewalking from one ship to the other was very well done. One of the opening sequences with the spaced out dune buggy was almost fun and nearly Star Trek in its rare humanity. If I was to re-write this story to make it plausible and fit in with the Star Trek universe, I would have had Romulus over-run by either Borg or Dominion forces and have the Enterprise the only ship that could save them and thus cement a peace that began with the Dominion war. At the end the total logic society would have taken over Romulous and it would be welcomed as part of the Federation. Shinzon, if you had to have Picard versus Picard, could have headed the Romulans loyal to the enemy rather than give up their struggle against the federation. We need one more Star Trek Movie like the Undiscovered Country for TNG fans. It is to pathetic to leave Star Trek at this travesty of a movie. One would think that after making millions of dollars with the entire Star Trek franchise Universal would at least like to finish it on a good note...and who knows maybe grow new fans for TV shows and movies in the future. Rick F",2005
8,"Star Trek: Nemesis has gone through the mill. At first it had the pressure of being an even numbered Trek film, usually a tell tale sign that it would be good. Then it has the pressure from fans who were not happy with Insurrection. So let's first put all things into perspective. Insurrection was not as good as First Contact but it certainly wasn't a bad film. It had a tight plot, developed the characters and was well paced. In fact all the Next Generation films are very watchable films, even Generations which seemed to think it needed William Shatner to prop it up.",2007
10,"I watched this movie again for the first time since seeing it in the theater more than a decade ago. It holds up quite well. If you're a Star Trek fan, and especially if you're a TNG fan, this movie will sit well with you. It has some interesting plot devices... one of which is what would you be like if your environment growing up was different from the one you experienced? You can judge a criminal for their acts, but what if you were in their shoes? An interesting idea fleshed out nicely in this film. Highly recommended! I grew up with TOS, but TNG is probably my favorite iteration of Star Trek. The cast and writing is top notch. The movie is well acted, well written, and satisfies. I was surprised the TNG movies generally received average reviews. They're great Star Trek movies!",2016
10,"Although the movie has its corny moments, Nemesis is a very powerful film, due in no small part to Shinzon, perhaps the best villain in the franchise after Khan. Shinzon is a complex, human character, and Tom Hardy brings him to life better than most Star Trek villains. Another reason for any success this film achieves is that it borrows elements and themes from the original Star Trek film series and applies them well. The action scenes are well conceived and not excessive, compared to the fight sequence in the recent, second Star Wars movie, which suffered from overkill. Several scenes, in particular, were very powerful and when the movie ended, I continued to sit for several minutes, speechless.",2002
10,"This film started off on a good note. The wedding scene was warm and lovely. But where o where were the O'Briens?? Surely Miles and Keiko would have been there. Wesley Crusher was... But these characters have always been good together and hugely watchable because of this. The discovery of the B4 android was an interesting idea, if a little boringly executed. If he had been given a glimmer of personality it would have been so much more interesting. Shinzon's story was a bit vague, but I thought Tom Hardy was quite good, in honesty could have been a lot worse. Just look at the S'ona in Insurrection for example. Boring. Shinzon's intent and general hatred for humanity was well written and could have been explored and expanded so much more. The battle in space was real good and so badly needed in a Trek film. Data's sacrifice was touching but a real cop out when B4 started humming Riker's wedding 'present' tune at the end. But, this set up things for Data to return, echoing the circumstances of 'The Wrath Of Khan' where Spock sacrificed himself, only to return in the next movie. Trek fans shouldn't slate this film too much as it had a lot of elements that usually please fans. Seen the cuts which had been made to the film recently, one of which explains Wesley's Starfleet uniform. Hope to see a Director's cut of this soon as these scenes explain a lot",2007

People just can't be satisfied anymore, and want things given to them with the golden spoon. Why can't people jsut go to a movie, sit there and enjoy something? Instead of being so bloody critical of the film? For crying out loud, Nemesis isn't Saving Private Ryan or Moulin Rouge, so get over it. Nemesis is Star Trek, and Star Trek is supposed to be fun. Nemesis was FUN!! Get over it and stop bitching!!! I love Trek Movies, and this one is probably my second most favourite from all of them.

It is impossible to explain just how idiotic the plot is without revealing crucial story elements, but needless to say even a moment's thought will make virtually every aspect of this story seem ridiculous.  SPOILERS FOLLOW - READ NO FURTHER UNLESS YOU'VE SEEN THE FILM OR DO NOT CARE: For example, how is it that the Remans knew a) that the Enterprise would be near the planet where B-4 was found, or b) that Picard would be sent in response to their invitation to the Federation?

A film that seemingly welcomes and passionately embraces all that is good and worthwhile in the world, `My Big Fat Greek Wedding,' directed by Joel Zwick, will make you laugh and make you cry, but most importantly, it will make you `feel.'  It's one of those rare cinematic experiences that afterwards makes the sky seem bluer, your step a bit lighter and a smile easier to come by; and when a film can do all of that, you know you've come across a bona fide treasure that you're going to hang onto for a long, long time in your memory.",2002

That's where the fun begins as Michael Constantine her father is not happy her daughter is marrying a ""stranger""(a non-Greek).  Constantine shines as he portrays a very protective, caring, loving father.  The movie was superbly cast. The movie is of light fare, great for the entire family.  Can't help to think that this would have made a great TV series.  Sort of a Greek ""All in the family"". I understand a sequel is already planned titled ""My Big Fat Greek Baby"".

Not only that, somehow the main characters then drifted off into the background and were lost behind the fairly boring, clichéd and uninspired depiction of the ""Greek wedding"" itself. ",2013
8,"This was a very pleasant surprise. Frankly, I was avoiding it because I thought it was going to be too tacky for my taste. It turned out that I needed some of the Windex, the father of the bride uses for everything, to clear my eyes and enjoy the film.",2002
6,"*Nice romantic-comedy about a Greek-American girl which has to fight against her family's strict traditions in order to marry a non-Greek boy. I think that, for the Greek people, this movie must be full of topics and stereotypes, but for the ones who don't know about Greek ways of life is pretty funny. There are all kind of weird characters (the grandma!!!), and the starring actress makes an outstanding job showing us the metamorphosis of that timid girl to a liberated one. Nice dialogs, nice rhythm... Just a nice entertainment for a Saturday afternoon.",2005
8,"'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' is a lovely film. There is absolutely nothing wrong with it. It is not an extremely good film but it just doesn't go wrong anywhere. The story is simple. Toula, played by Nia Vardalos, is 30 years old and still single. Her family is Greek so she must marry a Greek. Unfortunately for her family she falls in love with Ian Miller (John Corbett), definitely not a Greek. He falls in love with her too and so the only thing in the way is family.",2003
9,"This is a such a nice and entertaining movie. As in David & Layla directed by Jalal Jonroy, My big fat Greek Wedding too celebrates the love and cultural differences. Love, humanism, comedy, romance all are in that great film. My Big Fat Greek Weddeing brings people from different background closer and shows how important to accept the 'other' as other in order to be just happy! Being a migrant poses different problems and the individuals some times have to defy their original traditions and cultures to be able to love or be happy. In particular Greeks are very keen on and proud of their traditions and cultures (rightfully). I like the films which provide some insight and understanding of different cultures, or of individuals inner world. In this term My Big Fat Greeek Wedding does the job. That is why it is a very captivating film along with being funny enough to make you laugh even after you left the movie theater. I also recommend Mansoon Wedding, Bend It Like Beckham and David & Layla for the movie lovers. ",2006
8,"I resisted seeing it because it didn't seem to be something I would watch, but I was pleasantly surprised!! I liked all the actors in this movie especially Nia Vardalos and John Corbett. Suberb acting!!",2004
9,"One of the best comedies I already watched,'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' shows us a little bit of the Greek tradition in the north American environment. Toula Portokalos,daughter of two Greek immigrants,always had problems with popularity and friends,since she is so different from the regular blonde American girls. Besides, her traditional Greek family don't let her have many opportunities besides the ones that are about the Greek tradition. One day,Toula sees in her family's restaurant the beautiful and charming teacher Ian Miller, who she become very attracted to. Decided to change the rules of the traditional things in her house, she starts going to the university and working,until she finally meets Ian. They fall in love with each other, but the problem now, is Toula's family,specially her parents, to accept a non-Greek as son-in-law.",2005
1,"I've labored over how to express my intense hatred for this film.  `How can I hate this film?' many, many, MANY of you may ask.  My question is, `How could you even tolerate it??'  Whoever told Nia Vardalos that she could act should be spayed or neutered.  She apparently went to the Richard Gere School of acting which teaches one facial expression.  While his is `bland bemusement', hers is `bug-eyed shock'.  You know that a punch line is a'comin because her eyes will bug out as the wind up and then. the zaniness ensues.",2003
1,"I'm living in Prague, Czech Republic, where the movie was released not so long ago. I had heard and read so much about how great this movie was supposed to be, that I forced lots of my friends to come and see it with me. Horrible mistake. None of us even slightly liked the film. Ok, there are a few funny moments, but the characters are very cliché and we all had the feeling that we had seen the movie hundreds of times before. There was only one way how we could review it (sorry): too American and not Greek enough... To me it looked more like some silly money-making blockbuster, rather the work of an artist with a view and something to say (the moral was so plain and childish I felt offended !). Not sure Greek people will appreciate (no, I'm not Greek). And not sure I even learnt anything about the Greek culture in this ... God, what a waste of time and money ...",2002
1,"I find it unfathomable that this film was the breakout hit of last year.  My only guess is that it drove people to the theatre who were excited that it was low on curse words and sex.  Which is fine, but I wish that they could have added a bit of humor or drama.",2003
5,"A lot of people have been saying that you will not find this movie funny unless you have lived with, or are part of a Greek family. I am neither of these cases, and I really enjoyed the film.",2005
7,"Only watched My Big Fat Greek Wedding as it was nominated for an Oscar for Best Screenplay most likely for being a box office smash. It takes the rom-com model and applies it to Greek culture in a charming and informative way. While it has clichés of quirky side characters and such, it's done with such charisma that it's endearing enough to work in a unique way. The humour works, you come to care for the characters and it's edited with a Scorsese-like pace. I wish there wasn't such a distinct lack of conflict in the last act as it's almost as if the filmmakers couldn't bear to take their characters to the true crisis point and it ends not as satisfying as it could've been. Cute watch though.",2013
7,"i usually hate dissing the other reviewers on these things because everyone is entitled to their opinions, but, even though they usually frustrate me, i always read the reviews to gauge how a movie affects the mainstream public, as i think that's usually the most important thing to be considered.",2003
1,"I'm so glad to see that others disliked this movie as I did and for the same reasons. 'It's only funny (or sad) if it makes sense' as said by another reviewer. So true ! This is such unintelligent humor that so forced and overdone and unoriginal. And the characters are so cold-hearted and miserable but not in a funny way-in a creepy way. And since we're talking about a movie filled with stereotypes, I can say that I'd always thought the Mediterranean people for the most part were a warm and inviting people. Not here. The way they treated Ian was so uncomfortable and senseless and just weird. It was yet another film that made white men look weak and like big defenseless dorks. I'm married to a white dude who if my family would have treated him that way, he'd say a few choice words and never return and I wouldn't blame him; in fact I'd follow him out the door. And I realize that the whole point of the movie is that her family is so involved in her life because they care and blah blah but enough already! It got old and sickening after a while. OK we get it, you're close-knit and you fight and bicker because you love each other and that's your Greek culture etc. etc I wanted to puke already. Even Toula wasn't the friendly, sweet character I had in mind. Instead, she really lacked personality and warmth. You expect to fall in love with and root for the main character especially in a comedy like this, but I was halfway through the movie and didn't care whether she was happy in the end or what happened to her. And no one was sitting on the groom's side of the church: why? I guess it's comical that white people tend to have smaller and/or unsupportive families and less friends than Greeks ?? Not to me. And the way she looked before her makeover? C'mon! Who looks like that? It's not like she was supposed to have a mental disorder or something. Like I said, it's forced and unoriginal. It tries way too hard. I kept wondering when is it going to get good? When is it going to get funny? I can't believe that it's a hit.... Actually I can believe it. Movies that appeal to the masses usually suck. Good humor needs to be smart, clever and witty. This film and its storyline are none of the above.",2007
1,"I admire everyone who had the mental power to stand the whole film (actually the 6 euros that left my pocket forced me to). It is so idiotic you have to have brain disease at an advanced stage to enjoy the ""jokes"" and the ""humor"" of it. And at least, if you are trying to portray Greeks, use Greek actors! For us in Greece it was ridiculous to see Americans trying (and obviously failing) to imitate Greeks in their speech, their dance and their movements. By the way you won't find a single family in Greece remotely resembling these comic figures (well perhaps in some really remote rural areas). And while I certainly know this has nothing to do with Greeks of Greece, I was told by quite a few people that it really strikes a Greek-American chord! We usually say here that people who left Greece during the 50s somehow froze their minds at this decade and carry with them this (non-existent nowadays) picture of Greece. This movie proves it.",2002
1,"I went to see this film after listening to 3 film critics on NPR provide a favorable review.  What a disappointment.  The film features poor acting, shallow characters, trite situations and predicable results.  No originality, no tension. The main character is dowdy, getting old in a hurry with no prospects for marriage when she meets a customer in her father's restaurant and falls in love with him.  He is WASPish, tall, dark and handsome.  What he sees in her is the lynchpin of the film and its weakest point.  None of the characters are believable:  to describe them as two dimensional would be a compliment.",2002
4,"This movie was bought for me, and I was actually excited to watch it because of it's high rating here on IMDb.  It is thus one of the biggest disappointments of my entire life.  The acting is actually good for what the actors had to work with, but that's not saying much.  The script is *bad*. If you want some examples of what I'm talking about (SPOILERS!!):",2003
6,"My Big Fat Greek Wedding is cluttered with so much eccentricism and ikeability that those who identify with it more will enjoy it more.  I wouldn't see it again, at least for some long period of months, mainly because after a while it became somewhat heavy-handed and had absolutely no where else to turn after its main points were made. Now I know this is a romantic comedy and all, but how amny times do you see the guy use Windex and NOT think that it's hilariously original and magnificent. ",2002
8,"i didn't expect much coming into this movie, i didn't hear much about it and Van wilder was one of the national lampoon movies without Chevy Chase. however this movie surpassed all my expectations. Van Wilder defines the slapstick teen comedy of the new millennium. loaded with sexual humor and innuendo, Van Wilder keep the laughs coming. i believe Tara Reid was at her hottest in this movie, and believe it or not, there are a ton of quotable lines to live by in this film. as for the plot, its just about some guy who doesn't wanna leave the college he calls his home until he meets a girl that makes him realize his own potential. this film was much better then the last 2 American pies put together. this is a true popcorn movie to watch with your friends.",2004

7,"Van Wilder (Ryan Reynolds) is a very popular student, who organizes big parties and raises funds for the most different causes in his college. After spending seven years in the college without graduation, his father Vance Wilder Sr. (Tim Matheson) decides to stop paying his tuition. He applies for a loan to continue in the college, and becomes a professional promoter of parties to pay the installments. Meanwhile, Gwen Pearson (Tara Reid), a student of journalism who writes for the college newspaper and is the girlfriend of an ambitious and brilliant student of medicine Richard, is assigned to write about Van Wilder. Her boyfriend becomes jealous and begins a personal fight against Van Wilder. In the end, of course Van Wilder and Gwen Pearson stay together. This movie is brainless, making 'American Pie' looks like an art movie but it is also very hilarious. Yesterday I laughed a lot and repeated many scenes, such as when Van Wilder applies for a loan; or with the strip dancer farting in the nightclub; or preparing the sandwiches for the fraternity of Richard; or when Gwen prepares a milk shake with colon-blow for Richard; or the examination of Richard for the medicine university. I agree that the jokes are scatological and of very low level, but I do not recall the last movie I laughed the way I did with 'Van Wilder'. Stop thinking and prepare to have 90 minutes of very funny situations. My vote is seven.",2004
10,"This movie is hilariously funny! I've seen it more than 4 times and it gets funnier every time! Ryan Reynolds is hilarious as Van Wilder, the lead role. Being that this is a National Lampoon movie, one would expect it to be funny. It definitely lives up to expectations of the previous National Lampoon movies. The script is ingenious and is extremely well-written. Many parts of the movie are unexpected, which makes it all the more enjoyable. This movie is so much fun to watch over and over again. The part with the dog and the ""eclairs"" is hilarious in itself. Although this is one of Reynolds' first movies, it is a big hit. Surely, we can look for more hilarious movies like this one in the future.",2004

10,"This movie is exactly what you expect from the genre: mindless fluff with adolescent jokes, nudity, and lots of gross-out stuff. It is, however, unapologetic about it, and invests a lot to carry things to the extreme, which is what gives it its charm. If you cannot take any of the above and find enjoyment in them, don't waste your time with Van Wilder.",2005
9,"This is a great movie, don't believe the critics on this one. If you get this on DVD you can safely fast-forward through the two over-the-top gross out scenes that virtually assured this movie would get terrible reviews.

7,"What this movie has and other movies lack are characters you admire and care about. The movie never succumbs to sentimentality, thankfully, and it keeps a high level of cheerfulness and humor through the entire running time. This is a movie that wants to party and have fun, where characters are in high spirits and at times a little inebriated. This is the movie that will put the National Lampoon franchise back into respectability. Not only is this movie gut-bustingly funny  if you can get past the crude visual puns like a pit-bull with what looks like a ten-pound scrotum attachment, and a crotch-enhancer pump that is mistaken for a bong  this transcendent comedy of gross manners is most affecting because it's incredibly well-made. Most college campus comedies are cheap in production value and clumsily structured. Van Wilder is exceedingly well-paced and smartly written, by writers Brent Goldberg and David T. Wagner (their love for Ferris Bueller is apparent) who know how to set up not only a joke but sequences of offhand slapstick that are irrepressibly absurd. Director Walter Becker (creator of the ingenious short-film Saving Ryan's Privates) handles the irreverent and random acts of background physical comedy with ease and panache.",2002
1,"I had the displeasure of watching Van Wilder for the first and last time last night. Oh  how it still burns in my head. This poor film suffers from some odd sort of cinematic  schizophrenia: sometimes it thinks it wants to be animal house as it's stereotypical  ""frat-boy-cum-slave-driver"" uses unidentified and nameless students as croquet posts  and tunnels, and sometimes it wants to be a sentimental love story. This movie feels like  a string of barely related pranks and humor that was patch-worked together with  something akin to a plot. Our hero, the amiable and misguided but otherwise kind  hearted Van Wilder is every college boys wet dream of a self-image: Intelligent but not  too intelligent, clever with comebacks, interested in finer things like love and friends  and disinterested in having a life revolving around work, living off his fathers bank  account, campus celebrity, blah blah blah.... I'm sure you've probably seen this before  and it was much better as a high school movie called ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"", or  was it ""Animal House"", or maybe this film just tries to lamely take concepts from these  better films and update them for a newer audience. Whatever it is it's pure crap.",2003

There's a name in the cast that can make you sure of this film's awfulness. Tara Reid... I can't imagine how could this chick get into the movie business.

3,"I will say this about National Lampoon's films of late---they are getting funnier--AND maybe someday, the movies they crank out now will be as good as the earlier ones they released.  The movie Van Wilder is OKAY, but I'm sure they could have done a bit better in churning up the laughs--everything is too heavily relied on gross humour.  The acting needed to be more memorable too.  Tara Reid--although looking great--had little acting range--she just seemed to go through the motions of the film.  Her character and Ryan Reynolds character had no real chemistry between them and the that made Kal Penn's character steal the majority of the film. Granted we shouldn't laugh at our fellow foreign exchange students, but we also shouldn't be made to pay over $5 for a mediocre film also. If anyone is thinking of purchasing this film---my suggestion is to rent it first.  This movie is a ""I'm willing to waste a couple of hours of my day"" movie.",2002

Ryan Reynolds is typically annoying as the title character who frees his college from studying and the ideal to better oneself and turns it into a party-zone with the help of recycled gags, predictable one-liners, and a slew of bad supporting actors and actresses. You probably liked this better however, when it featured John Belushi and was called ""Animal House.""",2003

Not only does the concept itself feel dated, but the execution is so horrendously bad that one can't help but cringe at every line of dialouge or story point in the film. Featuring some of the worst acting this side of Pauley Shore from newcommer Ryan Reynolds (apparently channeling Chevy Chase) and ""veteran"" teen film actress Tara Reid (whose acting seems to get worse and worse with each performance, if that is possible). Add in poor production values (everything from the boom being in the shot to continuity errors to bad sound mix) and a gratuitous use of contemporary pop songs in an attempt to sell sound tracks and what do you get? A waste of your money! Avoid this film unless you have a burning desire to watch typical wiseass movie frat boys get their jollies by devouring dog semen. GRADE: F",2002
4,"This ""movie"" might be funny if you're twelve, but otherwise, please avoid at all costs. There might be one or two genuinely funny moments scattered amongst the mess, but these are due solely to the charm and charisma of Ryan Reynolds... and the rather bizarre foresight the filmmakers had in casting Kal Penn as Wilder's assistant. These two actors own their characters, and single-handedly save the film from being a 1 out of 10.",2005

The plot points seem to come straight from the mind of an uneducated 15 year old with no inkling of comedic dialog or situations. Although the lead actor was supposed to appear as a hero to his fellow students, he never supported that in anyway with his behavior on the screen. I guess we are just supposed to assume that he is 'all that'. I felt sorry for the actors having to say these ridiculous lines. Maybe the young teenage crowd would find this entertaining for the crude humor and flowery language, but anyone over the age of 17 should pass on this one.",2007
1,"This film, so far, is a genre all it's own. The genre it wants you to believe it fits into, would be the college comedy, the T&A, gross-out, bodily function type of film, minus the T&A, it has all that, but with a twist, a big gay twist. There was a point fairly early in this film when the characters go to a strip club, and I said, after seeing what had come before,if there is no female nudity in THIS scene, the director is completely gay. Now of course, he said back-pedaling, I don't know the director, or his sexual orientation, but it sure seems if he's not gay, he intended to make, as I said, the first ""Gay college comedy"" Now there's nothing wrong with making a gay college comedy, but hey, market it that way, let people know up front that there will be lots of male nudity, jokes about a dogs testicles, and jokes about men ingesting the issue of said testicles, men pulling down their pants and having explosive diarea into waste paper baskets. In my belief there are certain ingredients present to one degree or another in these types of films, and one you can't get away from is female nudity. See Road Trip to see this formula at it's modern (okay...90's) apex, Amy Smart goes topless, while in Van Wilder Tara Reid, decided not to show what many who watched assumed they'd see. There should be, in my opinion, a law, or at least a contract rider that says if you want to appear in a college comedy, (Miss Reid) you've got to show off what the public wants, and expects, and if not, well, hire another actress, but as I said, that's just my opinion. Now nudity, male or female won't make an unfunny movie funny, or worth sitting through, but at least it might feel like a reward for sitting through something at horrible, and unfunny as this movie. But if you feel like conducting your own experiment in terror, watch this, but get a copy of Road Trip as a palate cleanser for afterwards, it's not Citizen Kane, but it's amusing and the man who directed it finds new and interesting ways to expose the female form, the thing that many will be expecting to see when they watch this type of movie. And as a last note, I'm not gay bashing, I'm Van Wilder bashing!",2005

A book allows 300-400 pages (or more) to develop plots and characters. We are reviewing movies on IMDb, not books. I guess reviewers here want to appear erudite by scraping up details from the book that get omitted or distorted on the screen. I am a very active reader, but I simply cannot read every book that makes it to the movie theatres. Writing a book (a fairly isolated event) is a significantly different event than producing a movie which involves countless people and issues: screenwriters, actors, writers, directors, production people, locations, etc., etc. Making all these book to movie comparisons isn't fair to the movie or the book. Many times I just want to watch a movie and judge it on its merits alone - as a movie, period.

2,"The entire Jack Ryan franchise has been so royally screwed up, it just makes no sense. The sequence of Patriot Games, Hunt for Red October, Cardinal of the Kremlin (book only), Clear and Present Danger, and the Sum of All Fears all build upon each other (not to mention the books Debt of Honor, Executive Decisions, and The Bear and the Dragon, which follow). If you have seen the movies, my guess is you have no personal interest in Jack Ryan's character whatsoever, and don't really see how any of them are related. With no interest in the main character, I see little that would interest me in the plot – and therefore the film - let alone the franchise. This isn't just a ""the book was so much better than the movie"" rant. This movie sucks. The original book wraps such incredible tension into the characters as they all -- unknowingly -- approach the inevitable moment. There is no preconceived knowledge of what is about to happen. This movie reduces that tension (on the stereotypical ""can you hear me now?"" poor cell phone connection) to meaningless drivel with Affleck's moronic ""the bomb is in playI repeatthe bomb  is  IN  PLAY!!!"". There was more plot in ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" – and that's saying something.",2012

1,"And I'm glad I didn't shove my fears aside. It is now the end of June 2012 and I just watched this (ahem) film for the first time, and to be kind, I'm simply not impressed. As ""Terminator 3"" was appraised for being made to appease the masses and a disappointment for the Terminator franchise, so too has TSOAF earned that dubious distinction for the Jack Ryan stories. I cannot begin to describe how much I loathe movies that defy common sense where sense should be common. I mean, how does a hot-headed President get to the Oval Office if he is one to declare a tit-for-tat hit on Russia because they (assumedly) tried to take him out? Did Ben Affleck's Ryan use some secret force field to protect himself from the nascent radiation as he navigated the unreasonably lightly cluttered (if not unrecognizable) streets of Baltimore? How was he able to send and receive wireless communications so soon after an EMP, much less able to use Bill Cabot's magnetically-stripped ID card to get into the Pentagon? And did the continuity folks miss the fact that Jack Ryan has now gone down twice in chopper mishaps? I thought the casting of Affleck was the biggest hindrance though. He just didn't seem to have that ""it"" presence for his characters' place in his world. That is, he seemed to be playing Maxwell Smart rather than Jack Ryan as evidenced by his immature-ish reactions at several points in the film, his high-octave voice in spots and his over-emoting the point at the climax. That's pretty tough to do given that the author of this review considers Affleck an actor with the acting range of a signpost. I think the directors mistake was in trying to make a stand-alone film rather than a sequel or even a reboot that respected the Jack Ryan universe. If I had a choice between watching this movie, or some 1950's drive-in B-issue, I'd warm the popcorn for the latter.",2012

8,"Sum of All Fears is an enjoyable thriller and the type of movie the Hollywood studios have always been good at making. It's slick, expensive-looking, well-acted and two hours of far-fetched fun. Ben Affleck plays CIA Agent and superman Jack Ryan PhD. Ryan is a former marine, linguist and all-round polymath who saves the world from impending disaster. Affleck is youthful and convincing as Ryan and makes him seem fallible and likable. Ryan becomes a confidant of the wise and sensible CIA Director Bill Cabot (Morgan Freeman) and acquires a beautiful and successful girlfriend (Bridget Moynahan) who believes he's a historian. ",2007

Never mind,Mrs R.,he's bound to get straight ""A""s in saving the planet from a nuclear holocaust.And here's how it all started.Are you sitting comfortably?....Then I'll begin. Once upon a time,back during the second Middle East conflict,the Israelis had a plane in the air 24/7 carrying a nuclear bomb.If they looked like losing(how's that for bad sportsmanship)they would bomb the crap out of Egypt.Sort of like picking up their toys and stomping off home.This plane - or one of a number of planes so equipped - I'm a bit confused on this point - is shot down and lies hidden in the desert for 29 years until it is discovered by Arabs,and a South African(taken over from the Brits in the International Villain stakes) buys it for $400 dollars,selling it on to a unregenerate nazi for $50 million.Said unregenerate nazi (Mr Alan Bates - a chain smoker just to add to his general bastardness) uses it to blow up a football stadium in Baltimore thus plunging the world into the nuclear abyss.Go figure. Luckily young master Ryan is able to get a few days off school to persuade the Russian Premier and the President of the United States that he knows better than either of them and after some jolly tense moments the President grits ""Stand down to Defcon 3"",thus earning young Jack a Gold Star. I have never read the book on which this daft movie was based.I can only imagine that it has been dumbed down and made more child - friendly. Perhaps young Jack can read it for himself when he gets a bit older. Until then he should content himself with learning that Paris is the capital of France,Vienna is the capital of Austria.....are you paying attention?I'll be asking questions later.....",2009
10,"Just finished the last episode of series three, and was reminded why this is my favourite show of all time. I think the comparisons to 24 are quite unfair--they both deal with terrorism, but the similarities end there. Spooks is far more cerebral, and spends more effort on character and plot development.",2006
10,"I've been hooked and reeled. I absolutely love MI-5/Spooks. I rented all the available series and I crave for more. I'm anxiously waiting for 2005 to become available. The characters are unique and intriguing. The story lines are complex and luring. The acting is top form. As far as I'm concerned nothing here in the U.S. comes close. We had Mission Impossible (covert missions and fancy gadgetry) but MI-5 is fathoms richer, and smart. I'm a loyal fan of Keeley Hawes first finding her in Tipping the Velvet and recently viewed Our Mutual Friend. She's an outstanding actress and her MI-5 colleagues perform with such command of the art. As far as I'm concerned the BBC can do no wrong.",2006
7,"The early seasons of Spooks, a well-produced BBC action-drama about a small band of MI-5 agents serving to protect the UK, provided compelling entertainment. Giving the writers some latitude in developing plots that had the same team of MI-5 saving Britain each week from a variety of home grown and foreign militants, the show had excellent production values, good story lines and developed the characters' background to help create audience empathy. Led by Matthew Macfadyen and Peter Firth, the actors had good chemistry and, occasionally, the plot raised interesting questions about the dilemmas faced by domestic intelligence agencies. ",2008
10,"Ever since Spooks hit the BBC back in 2002, it has been essential, innovative, superbly written and action packed drama. The first season of the show was exceptional, the show was so ground breaking in the stories and themes it tackled that it won many plaudits and won many prizes. But Seaon 3 of the show was rocked by the departure of its main stars and I will talk about that later, but first I will go over the show generally and the first two seasons particularly...",2005
10,Truly a riveting show. It is not at all like its American counterparts in the sense that one has to pay close attention to the dialog of the show with its witty and often intellectual remarks.,2008
10,"I have been watching spooks ever since it has been broadcast here in Australia. Spooks is very realistic and follows story lines that are real close to real world events. Over the past four seasons spooks has gone through many changes and has in season 3 lost there three main leads Tom,Zoe,Danny and replaced by Adam,Ros,Zaf who still make the show just as exciting more to the point realistic and serious. These episodes are very Controversial and have got a lot of suspense but if you are looking for excitement suspense and even some character based plots well you have come to the right place,good choice of show. i would just like to say keep it up england your doing a great job. ",2006
9,"Rarely do I find DVD's of Broadcast TV worthy of the expense. MI5 or Spooks is one of the rare exceptions. As an American, I've been limited to the A&E versions, which has others have stated, are edited to allow for commercials. The pace, the actors, the plots even in the edited versions are exceptional. When I found out I could purchase the series on DVD, I gladly did. The only other Broadcast series I've purchased for myself, are Secret Agent Man (danger man in the UK) The Prisoner, and the Hornblower series. I've been pleased with all. The bonus with MI5 is seeing the full episodes. Unlike American series, the UK series have short seasons which keep the story lines clear, concise, intelligent, and plot driven not profit driven. The actors are generally given fleshier roles and unlike many U.S. shows, the actors seem to be chosen on talent, rather then a ""look"". MI5 brings a sense of what it may really be like in the intelligent community, as a clear delineations of right and wrong crosses paths with politics, ambition, and geo-political idealogy. In short, MI5 raises many morality issues while at the same time, filling one with suspense.",2006

7,"Caught the series 7 (dealing with FSB and traitors). Professionally done, nicely played, sloppily written - still a lot of fun to watch. A network of sleeper agents in Britain, heavily armed Russians in London hunting MI5 operatives in the streets of the capital - if you, like me, remember the ages of the Cold War - this will be a interesting experience. The story of the season's finale is not original: it reminds the 1977 Don Siegel's Telefon with Charles Bronson (without the mind control, mind that). However horribly inept Russians with golden crucifixes speaking horrible Russian wanting to destroy England aplenty! If you catch it on the telly - do not miss.",2011
6,"""Spooks"" is, was, and always will be a super thriller, and marvellously stylish. It has always depended upon the willing suspension of disbelief by its audience, but the 2008 series now showing in Australia has imposed too strongly upon my ability to believe. Thrillers always rely upon the notion that the stakes are high. In current series, the goal is to prevent war between the West and Iran, with a chance of WWIII beginning. However, I find myself beginning to approach a new episode with a shrug of the shoulders: ""How is the world going to end this week?"" Then Malcolm's ability to break codes with seconds remaining to Armageddon is just too far out of the realms of the credible. And he does it every week. Every person in Greater London must have his or her own camera trained upon him/her, because, except when the plot requires someone to drop out of sight, anybody in the city can be found within a few seconds.",2009
10,"From watching a few episodes from BBC online, I was totally hooked. I then bought 9 seasons of Spooks and watching one to two episodes a day. What I love about it, is that it doesn't try and glorify the roles of Mi5 agents, it feels so realistic, and well it touches on topics that you feel wow, what our governments are probably doing to protect our country and keep us safe that we will most likely never know about.",2013
8,"If I could give this a 7.5 I would, but sans .5s I'll give it an 8 because when this series was good it was really good.",2012
9,"I disagree with most of the naysayers here. Spooks is a consistently great show. Its seventh season was just as good as its first. Yes, there are some episodes that are not as compelling as others, and occasionally the replacement Spooks do not seem as interesting/endearing as the ones we lost early on, but the stories are always fast-paced and the dialogue snappy. The complaints about the choice of story lines is sort of nutty; if every episode were about Middle Eastern terrorist the show would go stale quickly. I'm an American and I don't take offense at the shady CIA guys in dark sunglasses stalking around. (It's television, for Pete's sake.) And how p.c. can a show be that has one MI-5 officer say upon reading a mocked-up human rights speech, ""It almost makes me believe in civil liberties!""",2009
10,"At a time when the schedules are top heavy with imported American action series, 'Spooks' is like a home-grown breath of fresh air. Spooks is a series which has generally improved with each successive year. It has been running in the UK since 2002, with the ninth series airing in the autumn of 2010. ",2007
10,"Spooks is certainly one of the best shows ever made for TV. One of the reasons is the basic principle that nothing is clear cut black and white but that every single character really is very ambivalent. So on the one hand there are ""heroes"" (otherwise it would be boring) but on the other hand the role of the security services is not glorified. That intelligent outlook makes is good watching. Apart from that the story lines are on the one hand believable (I wouldn't go as far as to say realistic as the show keeps the number of people involved in any given case to an unrealistically low number and the cases happen one after the other) but also original. The standard of writing is very high and the authors stay clear of spy story stereotypes. There really are no flat characters in this show which makes it really delightful and no character is safe which adds to the suspense. In season three basically all three main characters which did carry the show over a number of years disappear. It is done again in a believable way and the three new characters give the show a new (although not necessarily better or worse) dimension by their MI 6 past in the middle east and the addition of a husband/ wife team. And again, the Thin Man stereotype is avoided. Personally I preferred the McFadyen character because he was less of a stereotype (essentially he was really uncool) as Penry-Jones's who acts against his posterboy image. He is a great actor but his looks really are in the way of being taken seriously. But you can't blame him for that. Generally speaking I find it amazing that they manage to tell an exciting, multi layered and ultimately satisfying story in the 60 minutes format. Spooks is also one of the few TV shows that's visually innovative.",2007
8,"I've seen a lot of anime throughout the years. I've seen what people call the 'good stuff', I've seen the 'bad stuff'. In time, I realized and accepted that not everyone is going to like something, or dislike it. No matter what the anime (or movie, or book, or game, etc.) it boils down to personal preference. So, how do you know if you'd like something you've never seen but heard so much about? When I first started Naruto, I saw the potential in it. From the first episode, they presented a distinct setting with distinct characters. Sure, archetypes were being followed (the boy dreaming of becoming big, the old grandfatherly figure, the teacher, the rival). The first episode showed emotion and depth to its main character and what he will struggle with, along with the dynamics of his interaction with other characters and their quirks.",2007
10,"Naruto is...how to say? Magnificent, glorious and entertaining. Its almost flawless in the way it presents itself. The overall story is new and refreshing. The characters are inspirational and beautifully portrayed. The fight scenes ae overall breathtaking and neat. The drama in here is very emotional and moving. The jokes are well executed but sometimes overdone. Most people complain how most of the characters are unreal. But who cares. Their fun and feel real once you give the show a chance. If you ain't an anime fan then give this show a chance. Those who are anime fans will simply love it. There is nothing really to hate about it. Pure perfection. 10/10",2006
10,"OK, so I've watched 103 episodes so far of this series, and I have to say it, Naruto is original. Yes Mishimoto was a big follower of Toriyama, and in many ways Naruto is a sort of homage to him. But Naruto has a lot of things that DBZ was missing. First off, when characters die, THEY STAY DEAD!!!!! There is no special way to wish them back. Once they're gone they're gone. Second, music: the music in Naruto is 100X better then anything heard in DBZ. Dbz did have some cool themes, but Naruto is the only series where I have actually imported the soundtrack. There's almost nothing wrong with the soundtrack other then the usual soft theme. Granted it isn't a Yoko Kanno piece, but in essence not everything should be compared to the work she does because it invariably falls short. Thirdly, character development:",2004
10,"DBZ may have a lot of action. It may have a lot of fights. A lot of people say DBZ is the best, and better than Naruto but I disagree. DBZ's storyline is not that good, but Naruto's is strong. Also, Naruto has some action too, and plus a great storyline it beats DBZ. It doesn't matter how much action a show has. It has to have a good storyline with it and that's where DBZ starts to fall apart. This is just my personal opinion. I hope that I have some people who support this because when I post comments like this somewhere else I feel like the odd man out. Anyway, this is what I feel and if anyone disagrees please comment back politely.",2008

10,"Naruto has to be the greatest anime series on the whole world, it has it all comedy, drama and jaw dropping good action fight scenes. the best fight has to be the fight between naruto and sasuke in the valley of the end, the detail put into making that fight alone must have taken weeks. Overall the best anime ever, its worth watching. i used to watch dragon ball z but compared to naruto, its nothing. its slightly disappointing how its has a lot of filler episodes staring from about episode 145 and how much of the story line is flash backs from the characters past. Also the legendary 3 have a fight and thats nothing much compared to most other fights scenes on the series, its supposed to be the ultimate battle against all of the 3 legends of the nartuo world, but the other fights and the main story line makes up for that. the characters are all SO original the most original has to be gaara of the desert, his ninjutsu is the power to use sand, to defened and offend the target, hes got to be my favourite. Orochimaru is a VERY original character alswell, when he first shows up in the story, your not sure if thats really a bad or good guy which makes it even better to watch. After watching an episode you just have to go onto the next one. I got through the whole zabuza saga in one day, I just couldn't stop watching it. you should really consider buying the Japanese version as the American version is not nearly as good.",2006

The opening and closing songs are great , unlike the one used in the dubbed. The series are about ninjas yes, but these are not your ordinary ninjas. A different on-take of them. The main character , Naruto wants to be recognized by his village and one day become the Hokage (head of all ninjas in the village). Did I spark your curiosity ? Then watch the series. It has it all Humor, action , drama so much suspense not much romance as of yet. If your a person who likes great villains well this anime just seems to have a whole bunch wrapped into one. Again watch the original , support, the dubbed will just make you want to turn your TV of. Right now the series are on fillers. The anime won't follow the story line until March or May.

None of the characters in the show look or act like real ninjas. Real Ninjas are all about stealth, but these ones seem to only fight in the open. The melodrama is very typical and pointless.",2007

What started out as a potentially good possible coming of age story, became the next watered down franchise to make even Pokemon quiver in it's boots, ""Belive it!""

The modernization of the past movie and book makes this movie very enjoyable, especially if you have seen the old version and/or read the book. I highly recommend this movie to everyone. The movie and other versions of it, I feel, should all be seen. This is because I found it very intriguing seeing the advancement from how the world was when H.G. Wells wrote the novel to the movie that was made years later. The movie made in 2002 enhances H.G. Wells version and the version in 1960. When H.G.

It's a listless, plodding, mumble of a film that gets so bogged down in special effects that it never comes close to capturing the adventurous spirit of the classic H.G. Wells story.

Now I'm a sucker for cheese and camp but this movie made absolutely no sense. There was no joy in any of the performances or any humor. There were no thrills and that silly bookend with addy's character of filby throwing his hat in the air was the last hackwriting straw. I felt very violated when this movie was over and I still refuse to believe it was only 90 minutes it went on forever.

However, while the relation between the movies like ""The Musketeer"" and the books behind them is pronounced well enough to justify referring to these movies as rather humorous parodies, ""The Time Machine""'s connection to H.G.

2,"MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS. I know that mostly everyone has forgotten this spiritless and pointless failure of a movie that was obviously intended to leave bad impression of H.G. Wells with everyone who never actually read his books. However, I just have to highlight even more stupidities and inconsistencies that this flick is essentially made of. Hopefully, I will not re-hash too much of what so many other reviewers already mentioned. Just to be fair, I want to bring up the only TWO positive points of this movie - the actual Time Machine prop that actually resembled the original concept (as far as its description goes in the original text) and made a solid steam-punkish impression of the Edwardian-era futuristic technology AND the Sienna Guillory's appearance. Despite of not being allowed to do much, she does a great job playing a romantic, cute but serious lady who just keeps popping up in all the wrong places at the worst possible time. Now, to the not-yet-mentioned-flops as I perceive them. 1) Why this movie is called ""THE Time Machine""? Does it imply that this is THE most definitive, most all-encompassing story that beats the original book without even following 99% of the author's story line? 2) We are lead to believe that Alexander's short chat with the steam-powered vehicle driver allows him to learn the way to build a better steam power source. So, upon being called to do so, Alexander builds his totally self-sufficient time-traveling apparatus that evidently uses the power of steam (recall all the steam pressure gauges that machine proudly displays) to provide sufficient energy for a limitless number of time jumps in all possible directions. I mean, since no actual time machine exists yet, it is pointless to argue what it can be powered by or how much of what kind of power is necessary, etc. Although the Back to The Future's time machine that required a carefully balanced mix of high speed motion and influx of great number of Gigawatts of electricity made a more convincing (though somewhat humorous) impression of a time-traveling apparatus. In the H.G. Wells's original novel there was no specific mentioning of the power source employed by the time machine. One just knew that it was not horse-powered and the power source was actually self-contained. 3) What made the script writers think that back in the late 19th century NYC a public place filled with respectable public would be favored by armed robbers? Come on! There was more than enough social segregation in existence during those days that made it practically impossible for a low-life lower class armed robber to even appear in the midst of respectable and well-to-do public. I can hardly imagine anyone insane and lucky enough to be willing or able to carry out a time-stretched armed robbery resulting in shooting a robbery victim to death. Keep in mind that a large caliber revolving pistol produces TONS of noise and police used to patrol such public places ON FOOT (not locked up in cars staring at computer terminal screens like they do it today) at a distance of being able to hear a police whistle produced by a nearby patrol (cops had no portable radios then). 4) Now, the idea of the Moon falling apart from some nuclear mining operation is ridiculous (although beautifully depicted) considering what our next-door space neighbor went through already with them giant meteorite impacts and stuff. 5) WHY the Eloi were turned into some sort of a mixed African/South American tribe living in hanging flower pots is waaay beyond my understanding. No one can possibly believe that such obviously physically capable and inventive group of people would fail to defend itself from some ape-like primitively armed and armorless Morlocks. Obviously, the directors wanted to include some strong but oppressed people of color to the movie, but did not know how and why to do it. 6) Why was the Uber-Morlock character added to the movie? What ""insight"" did he provide? If he was such incredibly powerful mind-controller, then why did he resort to a primitive knife fighting and chocking? That was just ridiculous. 7) What happened to the planet in the far-far away future? We just see a bunch of the Morlock-built scary structures all over the place. Which means that they did not eat all the Eloi at once after all or they got scared of messing with Eloi and started eating one another instead? 8) What made Alexander abandon time travel without clearly learning the reasons why the past cannot be changed? Being a true scientist, would he just drop all his research like this? If one is to speculate about this topic of changing the past, the assuming that the past that already happened cannot be changed, then traveling ""into"" in would be impossible in the first place. Or an attempt to change the past would result in a ""fork"" in the time line thus creating an ""alternate"" reality. But the movie does not bother to bring up any of these theories. 9) What made it possible for the NYPL to nicely survive all the disasters, land changes, ice ages and who knows what else that presumable took place in 800,000-odd years? Even the shelves storing PAPER BOOKS were left practically intact. The books themselves stayed there unmoved! Why? The library was not hidden deep underground and filled with inert gas or something! There would have been absolutely no trace of any library left whatsoever. And so on and so forth. In short, you should really just read the book first and foremost.",2013
5,"When DreamWorks Pictures and Warner Brothers teamed up to film H.G.

Previously, Wells directed two animated features: ""Balto"" (1995) and ""The Prince of Egypt"" (1998), so ""The Time Machine"" challenged him as his first attempt at a live-action outing. Not surprisingly, Simon says in his introduction to Ace Paperbacks' new edition of his great-grandfather's venerable novel, ""The film we set out to make is not a verbatim recapitulation of the book. We did not intend it to be. I do not feel it is the duty of filmmakers to simply put books on film. That would seem to undermine both media."" Apparently, something undermined Wells because 18 days before shooting wrapped, he succumbed to extreme exhaustion, and Gore Verbinski of ""The Mexican"" replaced him. Yes, ""The Time Machine"" surpasses the dreadful ""Mexican."" In fact, the new ""Time Machine"" depicts its subject matter with far greater verisimilitude than its Oscar winning forerunner. The lengthy, snail-like end credits reveal that scenarist John (""Gladiator,"" ""Any Given Sunday,"" and ""Bats"") Logan drew on David Duncan's script from the original 1960 M-G-M epic, directed by George Pal, starring Rod Taylor, Yvette Mimieux, Alan Young, and Sebastian Cole. Indeed, Pal's version rather than the Victorian 1895 novel (serialized in 1894) inspired Wells and Logan.",2008
9,"I've read many of the comments regarding Adaptation, and it seems as though most people have disliked this movie because of its ending. They make claims such as, ""Kaufman's script was great until the end,"" or, ""Why did Kaufman talk about not wanting to ""hollywoodize"" his script, and then do it in the end anyway?""",2004
9,"After the phenomenal success of 'Being John Malkovich' in 1999, screenwriter Charlie Kaufman was commissioned to adapt Susan Orlean's non-fiction novel, ""The Orchid Thief,"" for the screen. However, it didn't take long for him to realise that Orlean's book was basically unfilmable, its sprawling and ponderous story lacking any clear structure or coherence. After some months of struggling vainly to write a screenplay from the novel, Kaufman's script inexplicably became the story of a writer's effort to adapt an unadaptable novel. Kaufman's completed script was presented to his financial backers with some trepidation, but they reportedly loved it so much that they decided to abandon the original project and film his screenplay. Spike Jonze, who had also directed ""Being John Malkovich,"" returned to direct ""Adaptation,"" the quirky, twisting, self-referential film that received almost universal critical acclaim. Much like Federico Fellini's classic 1963 film, '8½,' from which Kaufman almost certainly drew inspiration, 'Adaptation' tells the story of its own creation.",2007

So it suddenly becomes a thriller, there's drama added to a genuinely moving story and characters, and it seems to rush towards its ending unprepared. But that's the whole postmodern element of the film - is it deliberately bad and pat (like the Player - a much lesser film that doesn't stand up after repeated viewing)?",2003

I've seen more plot twists in a half-hour television show.

I wish I could be creative, but I don't think my brain works that way.  Charlie's brain comes from a brain factory.",2003

The only one that I'd have to say was the best was by Nicolas. He seemed like he was very into his character. But the movie, despite being only 2 hours, felt like it was 3. I just couldn't believe that anyone else couldn't find this movie to be boring. How it could be on the top 250. It's trying to be another ""American Beauty"", and it failed. Sorry to those who enjoyed the film, but I have to say it was horrible.",2004

Deeper thinkers will explain that he's interestingly depressed, socially inept, whatever...he's a dip. Notwithstanding that his character supposedly wrote a good screen-play, he becomes immediately tiresome. Not funny, not pitiable, not dramatic...boring.

Cage is fun, even if a dork is always fun, but Jonze ruins it all with bad shots and, dulcis in fundo, an ""I-love-you-I-love-you-too-plus-flowers-growing"" end.

Granted, the imagery may be impressive, and the action is exciting, but apart from a very few details, ""Scorpion King"" may as well be a completely different movie. In quality, it fares about as well as the average sword-and-sandal epic. There is a camp factor that hangs over the story, that you feel when listening to some passages of dialogue.  Also noticebale are Grant Hislov's comic relief role as Arpid, and Kelly Hu as the belly-baring sorceress Cassandra.  Wrestling fans may enjoy this vehicle for the Rock, but I don't think many others will.",2002
6,"The ability to win over new fans is not easy when one is shoved into the limelight so quickly.

Originally only taking part in wrestling, Johnson was bit by the acting bug and agreed to star in this film as his feature debut. As known by many, this spin-off movie was a prequel, to a sequel of a movie that was a remake of an older movie. Sounds confusing, but it can be understood. Once you think about it, it does make sense. As for being a well-written story,..not really. There are a lot of pluses to this film but it has its drawbacks too.",2015
10,"In what has been marked as a very anticipated film this summer, I bet you hands down that it is the only one which doesn't fall short. The Scorpion King comes through with great action, romance for all the ladies, girlfriends and Rock-ets, as well as comedy, and SNL shows how well The Rock does comedy (Not to mention the WWF!). This film takes time out to laugh at its self, which you have to respect an action film that knows it is not an Oscar winner. Overall, a movie that makes you say, ""Now that was worth 8 bucks!"" and really mean it this time. I thought that the movie had everything it promised and then some. A good beginning to what looks like a long run for The Rock in film. If you haven't seen this film yet - what is wrong with you!? Go...go now!

7,"If you've watched 'The Mummy Returns' you may be aware that it was Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson's first on-screen role. His contribution to the film was hardly iconic, but it appeared to be career-defining enough to give him his own spin-off movie, 'The Scorpion King.' Ignoring the fact that he was a baddie in the Mummy Returns, he's now our hero. And for good reason – he's so damn lovable! It's hard not to root for him, even in a film that really isn't that good. Not that that applies to The Scorpion King. It's great fun. Hardly a classic, but just good fun. And, I'll wager that the demographic most likely to appreciate it would be young boys (or men like me who are still into sword and sorcery etc – I think that qualifies me as a 'geek'). I can see gangs of young lads crowding round the telly on a Saturday afternoon to watch the Rock beat countless faceless baddies to a pulp.",2015

9,"Being afforded a life of independent means can be a blessing in some regards, perhaps, but it can also be the definitive test of one's character. If one chooses to use such a situation toward altruistic ends, or at the very least a venture that can provide some personal fulfillment, it says something about who that person is.  On the other hand, if one squanders the opportunity on a totally self-absorbed, shallow existence, it says even more.  And while taking the latter path may provide some interesting moments, it's a cosmetically created, external bubble that serves no other purpose than covering up an empty life, and sooner or later-- to anyone with even a modicum of intelligence-- that bubble is bound to burst; and when it finally happens, when the wake-up call comes, how one responds to it is the ultimate test of character, which is what happens to a such a man in `About A Boy,' directed by Chris Weitz and Paul Weitz, and starring Hugh Grant.",2002

I had read the book shortly before I saw it and when I heard Hugh Grant was going to star and the Weitz brothers were chosen to direct I didn't exactly have high hopes. I thought ""American Pie"" was funny and all but this kind of story demanded someone more mature, someone clever. This movie, however, turned out to be all that: mature, clever, witty, sensible, honest and, most of all, really funny in such a natural way. Hugh Grant has never been better in any role before or since and the soundtrack by Badly Drawn Boy is just perfect for the movie. The only thing they overdid a little was Toni Collette's character. I've never seen a person like that in real life. What I did like was the way they changed the ending for the movie. Usually that's not a good idea but it totally worked here. After all, I still liked ""High Fidelity"" a tiny bit better (the movie, not the book), but ""About A Boy"" comes very close. If you are just as much a fan of this book/movie as I am, get the DVD.

He meets ""Will"" (Hugh Grant) who is a self-obsessed bachelor; they both become ""friends"" in an intricate and funny way, by Marcus practically barging into Will's life, taking over his home after school.

Toni Collette received several nominations for her supporting role, but the substance of her character is not quite apparent; while Rachel Weisz's subplot comes together and undone a little too easily.

Unfortunately for their movie Treasure Planet, either it was ahead of itself ambitiously, or it was rumors that spread like wildfire (when it was being released) that killed it. Actually, that's why I didn't see this film until very recently, because of everyone's (and mine at the time) prejudice against Disney features springing up amongst way too many viewers, and especially for this film.

There are plenty of funny moments, endearing moments (without being sappy), and just the right touch of suspense to keep you hanging on.

R.L.S originally wrote Treasure Island chapter by chapter for his son, as a bed time story for each night. When the story was first published it was actually condemned by some! Claiming that such violent tales encouraged boys to become ner-do-well's such as the pirates it glorifies! Suffice to say, Disney's futuristic adaptation fails to capture the rebellious nature of the original Treasure Island. Fans and fanatics can gripe all they want if a scene is missing from the book, or if a character's been changed, but as long as the core meaning of the story remains, it's essence. Then adaptation has been successful. Treasure Planet does not capture the essence of the book entirely, in fact it lacks a lot of it's power due mainly to the protagonist. Jim Hawkins of Treasure Planet does not suffer as much as his archaic counterpart, therefore his character does not under go the same heroic journey and does not emerge as profoundly changed as R.L.S original did.",2006
10,"When this film first came out, I was quite a bit skeptical, given what I thought was another lame Disney storyline like Atlantis, Emperor's New Groove and Mulan, and opted out of seeing it in theaters. Now 3 years later I was curious to see what it was all about, so I gave it a chance and rented it. To my surprise, I was blown away by the brilliant animation and complex storyline (going beyond the book), and wondered how this film could have been so overlooked. The coming of age story about a teenage boy deals with real issues in today's world, and how each of us has our own potential to reach. I also loved the score and the music by John Rzeznik. The only complaints I have is that Jim looks much older than his supposed age (15), perhaps 17 or so, and that the robot was obnoxious and shouldn't have been added in at the end. All in all, I'd have to put this on my list of favorite Disney films since The Lion King and Pocahontas.",2005
10,"Let's put it this way, with no fan-girlish outbursts (Which is pretty hard). This movie has pretty much everything required of a superb movie.",2006
10,"This movie, even though given a bad rap by the critics, happens to be one of the best movies in the world. If you have not seen it, step away from your computer and rush out to get it. I don't wanna see you till you have that movie. Got it? Good now watch it. This movie's amazing graphics, twisting and riveting storyline, although based on the book Treasure Island it has many changes, including story changes, characters, and its planets not islands. Its amazing even though made by Disney anyone from age 10-100 can love this movie! The final sense with Silver and Hawkins is amazing and yet, in a way a bit sad. (That might have been a spoiler thats why I checked Spoiler) I also Loved the Music, it was amazing. The greatness in the whole film was flawless. The song ""I'm still here"" by the goo goo dolls was spectacular. I could not find anything about this whole film that did not make me smile, with the voices fitting the characters perfectly, and the amzaing graphics! This was a amazing film by Disney. It would make Robert Louis Stevenson proud, especially for the name of the ship the RLS Legicy; or the Robert Louis Stevenson Legicy. You could really feel Jims struggle, and Silver's emotions. I could not find one flaw with this movie! I gave it a 11 out of 10.",2006
7,"Disney has been attempting their latest genre, ""action/adventure"", and Treasure Planet is yet another of these more adult films.  So far Disney hasn't done too bad in this genre, since we are now free of sitting through annoying songs and have more time to see the actual movie.",2003
10,"What a film!, action, drama, suspense, adventure, not to mention many other qualities any good film should have and qualities lacking in all but one other Disney film, namely the hunchback of Notre dame. the story focuses on young Jim Hawkins who through the greatest adventure of his life undergoes an incredibly emotional character transformation, from thug to respected spacer(sailer, but in space, get it?). and along the way is morally guided by a rather gruff and cynical cyborg, john silver, who happens to see in Jim ""the makings of greatness"", and so his heart is melted by Jim's situation(namely the loss of his father at a very young age) leading silver to disregard the ribbing's of his crew and lead young Hawkins to greatness. the film has its heart breakers to as at the end of the adventure, silver being found out as a pirate, must leave Hawkins side for what is quite possibly forever, don't forget the Kleenex, but leaves with him his beloved pet morph, an adorable little... eh... thing that can take on the shape of whatever it wants, and so if you want to see what i believe to be the greatest Disney film of all time, see treasure planet, you will not be disappointed!",2006
10,"Does it really matter what the ""professional"" critics think? My 5-year old's opinion is the only one that counts to me. He loved it and wants to go back again. He thought it was wonderful that ships could fly and never doubted that it was possible. Even though I took him to a late viewing he stayed awake and that is the best rating of all.....",2002

10,"I am a teenager and go to a grammar school in Germany and when I want to watch a movie I am always very careful in choosing. But I know, that usually Disney films are very good and have a good to high standard. I first saw Treasure Planet in cinema and when I got out of the building I just thought something like ""That was fantastic!"". Well, I know that I sometimes behave a bit childish, but it is important for me, that the movie I'm watching has got a message and has a standard and Treasure Planet is a film like that. So everyone who likes pirates, space, adventure, speed, a young rebel and treasure hunt is right with this movie. I think that some people know the story Treasure Island from R.L.Stevenson. (A ship in the movie is named after him - R.L.S. Legacy) Traesure Planet is based on this story but it's much more exciting in the film. I would say, everyone can watch that movie, because it's funny, full of speed and adventures and not too cruel - but: You should not hate strange characters!",2005
8,"I just watched Treasure Island, and I loved it!!!",2002
10,"For me there has always been one absolute way of knowing a classic when I see it, i almost cried. Now the macho face I pretend to be my own is hard to crack, but by the final scenes of Treasure Planet i felt it begin to crumble. This film has moved me to laughter, joy, and tears. A classic if ever there was one, this is one of Disney's best in a long time. A must see for people of all ages.",2002
8,"Simply stunning. Treasure PLanet is an adaptation of Treasure Island and I didn't know that movie but I think it's very good as a pirate story, so I didn't care how faithful adaptation it is. The first score for the film is the visuals and atmosphere, it is the most fascinating animated film I've ever seen. Combination of old-fashioned technology and hi-tech is a great idea that makes the film look really unique.",2006
9,"This film really got me where it hurt. The animation was wonderful, and I loved the way that they combined computer graphics and animation while creating John Silver, who was one of the best, and complex characters I have ever seen in Disney. The growing relationship with Jim and Silver was the highlight of the film and wasn't too sappy. The hug scene to me was a bit pulling at the old heart strings. I personally loved it and it has wiggled its way into my top 5 favourite Disney films. The humour was well done, but Captain Amelia stole the show along with Silver, with her sparkling vocab and Emma Thompson's lovely British accent! Jim is my favourite Disney hero seeing as he is portrayed in a very realistic fashion, as the rebel who is really, just a lost little boy.",2006
10,A typically fine Disney animated classic. The animation is beautiful and the Disney adaptation of the Stevenson classic is every bit as good as I expected.,2002
10,Treasure Planet is a visual feast.  It's blend of hi tech and low tech worlds is innovative and refreshing.,2002
9,"After seeing this movie I'm convinced Disney's back on track again. I liked Lilo & Stitch but that was more because of the Elvis filled soundtrack than because of the story or the characters. I had become a Disney-hater because all their flicks were rehashing the same old samo. Take a great story totally demolish it let the characters sing some boooooooooring songs (blerk) and add a funny side-kick with a famous voice and because they are the only worldwide distributed animation-producers numb the mind of millions of children and empty their parents pockets with all the merchandise. Well they will be still doing that I guess. Old habits, especially bad ones, die hard.......... But back to the movie. For starters there's only one song in Treasure Planet and it isn't even sung by the characters. The adaptation of Treasure Island is a great one. Not only have they finally used their imagination, the animation is fantastic. Best of all are all the wacky extras, which reminded me a bit of ""Sen To Chihiro Yo Kamikakushi"" (aka Spirited away), still the most amazing animation-flick I've ever seen, so that's no small compliment. I heard they bought the GHIBLI-studio's and I hope Disney will be GHIBLI-ed instead of GHIBLI getting Disney-ed, as I feared when I heard the news. Treasure Planet restored my faith in Disney and finally old Walt will be proud of this movie instead of turning around in his coffin in shame(It's a roughly translated Dutch saying). Keep up the good work and if anyone at Disney reads this.........",2002
9,When I saw the preview for this movie I hesitated to see it.  Taking Robert Louis Stevenson's classic story about pirates and putting it into space seemed like an unnecessary gimmick.,2002
9,"Wow, I can't believe I waited so long to see this film. I just never got around to watching it. The plot has nothing that interests me. I know nothing about soccer (football.) I am one of those American fools that has no clue. I had never even seen David Beckham before this film. I chose to ignore the buzz surrounding this film at the time it was released in America. Enough about me. ",2005
10,"Okay, first of I hate commenting on this thing but I felt like I had to stand up for this movie. So many people were bashing on it and I felt like people who might want to see it should get a second opinion.",2004
8,"Jess is 18, very smart and wants nothing more than to play football, when she joins a local team she has to lie to her parents again and again, as they would never approve of her chasing her dream, they want her to settle down with a nice Indian boy and learn how to cook.",2006
8,"The title of this film nearly put me off watching it.  Not being a Manchester United fan, the mere mention of Beckham was a bit off putting, however I put my prejudices behind me and I'm glad I did.",2002
9,"My scalp still smarts from the burning coals heaped on it when I vowed I love this film. Bring on the coals; I'll walk over them as well to say again that I love ""Bend it Like Beckham."" Granted, there's a lot of ""in spite of"" in that confession. It's a bit movie-of-the-week; the screenplay is on the paint-by-numbers side. And, most troublingly, the director's commentary implies that in this film beauty can be found primarily amongst the white of skin.",2005
10,"As a former 2 time Okinawan Karate world champion, I like movies about sacrifice for sport.  But this movie is about so much more.  This movie is so good and so deep.  I have recently been plagued by very serious injury and pretty much a disastrous lack of passion.  Almost lights out for me. And this silly little movie touched me so deep that like out of a daze it reminded me about what life is supposed to be about.  This is a movie about living.  Living your life for yourself and respect for others.  Empowerment. God, bless ""Bend it like Beckham"" I believe it is a true gem.",2003
10,"As someone who's never been into sports, it seems like it would be hard for me to get into the football (or as we Americans inexplicably call it, soccer)-themed ""Bend It Like Beckham"". But I gotta say, this was one cool movie! Anglo-Indian Jesminder Bhamra (Parminder Nagra) and her WASP friend Juliette Paxton (Keira Knightley) love to play football (yes, I'm going to say it the British - and international - way) and just adore football player David Beckham. But Jesminder's traditional Sikh parents don't approve (her mother offers a really whacked-out description of football early in the movie). Okay, so maybe it was sort of a cliché in that sense, but you gotta love this movie! And if like me, you go to this movie not knowing the definition of ""bend"" in football...don't worry, the movie explains it (I'd also never heard of David Beckham prior to this movie). And we all know that Keira Knightley hit it big: a few months after ""BILB"" came out in the States, she starred in the equally cool ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"".",2005
10,"As an anti-football person, I (on the surface) grudgingly took my younger brother to see this film, although secretly I hoped it might be East is East II. The trailers looked fun so I thought I'd give it a go.",2002
6,"Hey, check it out -- other countries can make predictable formula movies too! But seriously, even though no plot ""twist"" in this movie comes as a surprise, it's smartly written, full of entertaining little touches (especially concerning the main character's Panjabi family and their social circle) and thoroughly enjoyable. I came out grinning. Performances were good all around, too.",2003
7,I love playing football and I thought this movie was great because it contained a lot of football in it. This was a good Hollywood/bollywood film and I am glad it won 17 awards. Parminder Nagra and Kiera Knightley were good and so was Archie Punjabi. Jonathon Rheyes Meyers was great at playing the coach. Jazz (Parminder Nagra) loves playing football but her parents want her to learn how to cook an want her to get married. When Jazz starts playing for a football team secretly she meets Juliet (Kiera Knightlety) and Joe (Jonathon Rhyes Meyers) who is her coach. When her parents find out trouble strikes but her dad lets her play the big match on her sisters Pinky (Archie Punjabi's) wedding. At the end her parents realise how much she loves football and let her go abroad to play.,2005
10,"This movie explores the difficulties that strain hopes, dreams, love and friendship, and incorporates humour beautifully. Along with a stunning cast and brilliant filming, the sound track enhances and amplifies the atmosphere and mood of this work of art. All actors and actresses give an extremely good performance, surpassing expectation in every way. Parminder Nagra is brought on to the big screen for the first time in this film, and she is exceptional, capturing the vividness and vitality that this movie is all about. Keira Knightly also works well with her co-stars, and this is her best work so far.",2004
5,"I finally saw this movie on DVD the other day and I was greatly disappointed considering what I've heard of it. Sure, there were charming moments, like the Babaji thing and many other Indian-vs-British things, Jules' mother was hilarious, and Parminder Nagra was acting convincingly, but that was it.",2004
6,"''Bend It Like Beckham'''is quite a nice movie. I mean,it's not a masterpiece like ''BraveHeart'' or ''Schindler's List'', but it's good. The story is simple, about an Indian girl called Jesminder Bhamra who is supposed to be doing 'female things'like helping her mother to cook or thinking about her wedding, but what she really likes is to play soccer. Not to mention that living in London, her soccer idol is David Beckham. Jesminder and Juliette start to be friends since both girls have many things in common. Or should I say way too much in common,when it has to do with the couch? Of course we do have many stereotypes in this movie,like Jesminder's family, but we cannot forget that even in the present days is quite common to have many conservative people and families.",2005
8,"How can a movie be both controversial and gentle? This one does it with a near-perfect structure. No one wants their daughters to be athletes. Apparently most cultures don't want their daughters to be small-breasted, either. Here we see a bunch of superb actors we've never heard of before portray folks of different cultures living fairly humdrum lives until their female children want to, and have the potential to, become professional soccer players. The structure around the parallelism of the two cultures is wonderful. There is no condescension. Both cultures are seen as modern and valid. (And yes, both are silly, too). One flaw: the Hindu wedding ceremony seemed to involve hundreds of relatives but not one child among them.",2004
10,10/10 for this film.,2002
10,"This movie kept me entertained throughout and was very funny in parts. As a British born Punjabi, I could identify with key points and loved the odd moments of hysteria (spoken in Punjabi) by Jess's mother, Mrs Bhamra - boy have we all been there, ""Ohh Baba-ji ..."". The determination by the young football player to forge a career in a non traditional Asian occupation was inspiring and our hearts went out to the poor girl. Parminder Nagra was well supported by Archie Punjabi who is gorgeous, articulate and highly talented - what a babe - I think I'm in love! Anupam Kher (Mr Bhamra), a well respected Bollywood star helped to make this movie enjoyable but I don't think his real skills were exploited in this movie. Nevertheless, I would recommend this movie to most people but a must for young Asians living in a western society, as well as their parents of course. Both could learn a lot from each other. Music was great too - Loved the wedding bits, just brought back memories for me - You just can't beat a Punjabi Wedding - thumping Bhangra beats just get my shoulders going. Well done to all those that were involved - you certainly made me proud.",2002
1,"Oh my god ! This is terrible. Better scripts have been written on the back of matchboxes. As subtle as an avalanche and painfully predictable. A sad excuse for a film and a waste of obvious talent. Avoid, unless already braindead.",2003
6,"I'm glad when a movie like this finds an audience.  First of all, its not typical Hollywood product, which is a magnificent beginning, and you know that the director/screenwriter just had a vision of what kind of movie that they could make and didn't get all caught up in all that LA garbage you hear about.  They actually had a story to tell, had to sell it, and someone believed in the project. ",2004
7,"I don´t understand all the commotion in the user opinion section. Is Van Diesel a decent actor or is he not.  Can somebody shoot a gun while flying through the air or not? Are the Beatles better than the Stones or is Wet Wet Wet a better band than the Backstreet Boys? It´s entertainment, nothing more. James Bond uses devices not yet invented and Frodo has hairy feet. If you want to comment on the contents and value of a movie I think you must take another movie like Schindler´s List (10+ !), not a movie that was produced purely for the fun. Sit back, enjoy the ride, don´t expect any deep going conversation and just have fun.",2003
6,"Look, I'm not going to pretend that this is some sort of masterpiece. Though it is basically another ""generic action flick"", the twists that they add to it make it worth watching. The way they incorporate their ""recruitment program"" into the movie is fun and original, and though Vin Diesel doesn't really ""act"" in it, it's a lot of fun to watch. It has a few suspenseful plot elements, and the way they incorporate his status as an extreme sports star (not a spoiler, it's in the previews) into the way he conducts himself as a secret agent makes it more believable. Ever think about some of the stunts that go on in an action movie and wonder, ""Okay, exactly WHY would this particular person know how to do that?"", because it seems completely unlikely that there would be some sort of training program for the stunt they just pulled off? This movie doesn't have that, because whether he's on a motorcycle, skis, or whatever, you can believe that an extreme sports star would be able to pull off what he's doing. Though the plot is as unrealistic as most movies of this genre, the stunts are a lot more believable than you'll find in most.",2005
6,"For plot, xXx rates a 1.",2005
7,"Vin Diesel is a pretty good guy to play these new action-heroes. Like ""The Rock,"" he's a big, muscular macho guy who men can look upon with some respect and the ladies can fall for. Unfortunately, a number of these testosterone-filled action films, including this one, are somewhat moronic in nature. However, they are undeniably entertaining.",2006
7,"Let there be no doubt: The acting sucks. Even Samuel L. Jackson's performance is mediocre and definitely unexpectedly so. The plot is ludicrous, the characters unbelievable and the acting (oh, I mentioned this already) dilettante. Effects had gone overboard and factualities of science wildly disregarded. Yet! Yet, this movie was quite the entertaining one. Subtly (purposely?) funny at places completely overshadowing the dysfunctional slapstick that absolutely didn't cut it, and above everything else - it didn't hesitate. The action was brilliantly choreographed and impressively implemented.",2003
8,"I remember in high school a lot of students were talking about this movie xXx. Staring Vin Diesel, Samuel L Jackson, Asia Argento, among others.",2015
7,"This film is fun, with an easy plot to follow and a great soundtrack. the film is basically a 2hour long stunt. the one major criticism i have is that Asia Argento should stick to letting Daddy chop her up in his movies instead of trying to be a serious actress. The film is made all the better on a personal level in the fact that Rammstein make a live appearance at the beginning of the film. Vin Diesel has the charisma and potential to be the next big action movie star and has a really cool voice. Samuel Jackson gets to play his typical gruff shouting role that he has made his own and there are several stunts that are truly breathtaking, it is just sad that one of these led to the stuntman performing it's death.",2005
10,"Have you seen the trailer for this film??? Then forget about reading my review or anybody else's for that matter!  It doesn't take 2 brain cells rubbing together to know what you are going to get here, and you get PLENTY of it!  This was not a typical movie choice for me (my guy's turn to choose), but I had some idea what to expect and I think you do too. Having said that, here is a BIG SURPRISE - this was one of the MOST FUN, simply enjoyable movies I have seen in months, maybe a couple of years!!!  This film is wonderfully unpretentious.  It doesn't take itself too seriously, and we shouldn't either.  Does XXX provide deep intellectual insights, an elegantly constructed production with soul-searching performances, an air-tight plot with masterful dialog, gritty realism, completely true-to-life action scenes, brilliant editing?  Although the answer is obvious (in case you haven't seen the trailer, the answer is NO), a much better question is, WHO CARES?!  This movie is all about fun!  Crazy, mind-blowing, awesome (and in some cases,of course, obviously impossible) extreme stunts!  Diesel is charismatic and charming, the girl is sexy and engaging and the bad guy is appropriately nuts.  The plot is good enough. The way they take out a communications tower doesn't make much sense, but otherwise we'd miss out on another amazing stunt scene so once again, who cares!  (Hey, check out 'Signs', a supposed new masterpiece by a supposed great director, if you want to see a film that really makes no sense!) There's some humor and a few decent one-liners, too.  One of the Bond spoofs is even smartly hilarious (a car stuffed Bond-style with gadgets that end up being virtually useless).  The way this film is NOT extreme is also refreshing.  There is just basic shoot-em-up and action stuff - no extreme violence/gore, no extreme profanity, no extreme sexual content, and no extremely 'important' artistic message.  In other words, nothing to detract from the great fun of a fast-paced, amazing stunt-fest that is light, refreshing, and visually awesome.  The perfect summer action flick!",2002

4,"This starts with a man wearing a tux getting killed by some Slavic gangsters at a Nu-Metal gig . It's never mentioned on screen but the implication is that the dead man is Bond, James Bond and throughout the movie where treated to an alternative universe where the world is no longer saved by sophisticated suave secret agents but saved by a loud crass extreme sports loving American ",2005

1,"Any respect I had for Vin Diesel has been completely lost in this film. Xander Cage (Diesel) is an extreme sports star for some reason at the start steals a car and drives off a bridge with it. After being arrested he ends up in a top secret government facility under the control of Augustus Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson) and is told that Xander, along with two other guys are competing to get a top secret job and have his criminal record cleared.",2005
10,"The story to this movie was very different and creative. Even though people say it is a James Bond rip off, it is some way very different. The action scenes in this movie was great. Well done. A great cast for this movie. Vin Diesel was great for this part. I can't wait for the sequel to this movie. I am defiantly going to see it. It will probably be another great experience!!",2002

6,"Knowing that our government gives extreme convicts a chance to save our country makes me sleep like a baby every night... wait, no it doesn't. OK, the story, is incredibly unrealistic and not to mention some of the action sequences that go on. In general, I guess this is what you can classify a ""guy's flick"". But I'm not sure why, I kinda enjoyed ""XXX"" because it was very cool just to watch.",2006
1,"Poor Vin Diesel...... He had some great potential showing in things like ""Boiler Room,"" but he apparently felt that he found his niche in films like xXx, where lines are really corny and go something like: ""Do you want some ice before your brain overheats?"" It's a shame.",2006
7,"All I really wanted when I sat down to watch xXx was an action flick with some sex chucked in, and the odd cool technical thing. Leaving my judgement and values at the door, I waded right into the thick of the strangely harmless gunfire, unlikely situations and ho-hum dialogue, and I enjoyed myself thoroughly. I don't care whether Vin Diesel can act or not - and he can, in my opinion - I think he's gorgeous, and he certainly has the physical presence to fill this role with the requisite amount of aplomb. He might be a thug, but he's a thug with a soft voice, bright eyes, and big muscles - and he's perfect as Xander Cage. Candy for the brain, candy for the eyes - that's what xXx is, and I like candy once in a while.",2005
1,One of the worst films I have ever seen.,2003
6,"I'm rather pleasantly surprised after seeing Ghost ShipI expected it to be a lot sillier, more dumb and inferior than it actually is. Still a long way from being a good horror film but a step in the right direction, to say the least. Cast and crew paid attention to building up a horrifying atmosphere instead of attacking the audience with lame and violent killing scenes. That's an effort that gets my appreciation. The vicious opening sequence is professional horror a scene that grabs you by the throat and demands your complete attention and curiosity for the rest of the movie. The high quality level is held up a little while longer but unfortunately it loses his grip during the second half. For as long as the mysterious, deserted ship is portrayed as a complete riddle, the film is fascinating, interesting and beautifully shot. As soon as a few plot-aspects are clarified, Ghost Ship turns into a mediocre and predictable thrillerI'm convinced that, with a slightly more intelligent script, this could have become one of the better horror-thrillers since the new Millennium. Now, it's only regarded as a reasonable and decent effort that lacks a bit of talent. Nonetheless, the settings and decors make it worth watching. The graphic decorations aren't overused, so it remains a beautiful experience to observe at least once. Gabriel Byrne is acting far below his normal standards and yet he's still great! All the other cast-members are pretty uninspired and forgettable. I'd describe Ghost Ship as a nice waste of time. If you have the opportunity, I advise you to search for an 80's horror title called `Death Ship'a terrific piece of trash of which Ghost Ship borrowed a lot of ideas.",2004
8,"The savage team of a tug is ready to rest after the transportation of a platform. When they are celebrating in a bar, the plane pilot Jack Ferriman (Desmond Harrington) offers them the chance of rescuing a passenger vessel vanished in the oceans in 1962. Captain Sean Murphy (Gabriel Byrne), Maureen Epps (Julianna Margulies) and the rest of the crew, tempted by the possibility of a great reward, decides to risk one more rescue operation before going home. Their greed leads them, of course, to a ghost ship, where they are spooked and threatened by ghosts. One of them, a little girl, shows Epps what happened to the passengers and crew during the voyage in 1962. A horrible unraveled secret will haunt the rest of the crew. ",2003
6,"The third movie produced by the production company ""Dark Castle"" and managed by Joel Silver and Robert Zemeckis, ""Ghost Ship"" (2002) marks a step forward and constitutes a neat improvement in comparison with the two previous movies, ""the House on the Haunted Hill"" (1999) and ""13 Ghosts"" (2001). This can be checked at the level of a meticulous making and quite outstanding special effects. It is all the more positive as with ""Ghost Ship"", we deal with a B movie. Another good point: the change of scenery. It is a judicious choice to have replaced the threadbare topic of the haunted house by the haunted ship.",2004
5,"Now this I would call exactly an average film. For me, it landed precisely at the very center of imdb's 10 point scale, right at 5.5. This means that I found exactly as much to like as I did to dislike. There is a bit of inspiration here, but just as much that's stolen from other better horror movies. If it had opted for tone and real fear instead of cheap shocks, the movie could have been great. The story is good enough that it could have been great if handled well. But we do live in these times, and, although there are scholars of the modern era who would try to have us believe that the current generation consists of a bunch of kids who get everything instantly and process it on a billion levels at once, the truth is indeed the exact opposite. No, there is no subtlety here. It would go over your average teenager's head in a heartbeat. Nope, better play it safe and provide us with a gruesome scene up front where a couple of dozen people are sliced in half by a loose cable during a ball. Gore is not scary. I did however produce a dry heave during this sequence, which is more than I can say for any other gore scene that I've viewed lately. As the gore accumulates, I began to appreciate the artistry that was put into the enormous number of deaths. These are some sickeningly creative people, let me tell you. Unfortunately, the director (or screenwriters or whoever) ruins any real potential by revealing every detail about what happened on the titular boat in a fast-motion sequence accompanied by techno music! It's the kind of moment where you just slap your head for the lack of talent involved. And then there was more stuff I liked. For example, the art direction is very impressive. The revelation of one character's identity, while not particularly surprising, is at least somewhat new. I give this film a 5/10, rounding down because I felt the final moment was a bit groan-inducing.",2003
7,"This films best bits are in the special effects and those moments when you jump out of your seat. The opening sequence lulls you into a false sense of calm, from then on its guess the scenario.  The viewer is always two steps ahead of the actors but, for the most, grips you nevertheless. The special effects are especially good and the acting, although no top-notch stars are evident, is not bad. The end is a real twist. Better to watch this than many others I could mention, certainly worth the video rental and a pizza.",2004
6,"Spoiler Alert! I love Dark Castle entertainment, I didn't love 13 Ghosts, but I did really enjoy House on Haunted Hill. I loved the original HoHH, and I thought the 'remake' was inventive and had some unique parts to it. It wasn't brilliant, but the special effects were beautiful and the sets were magnificent.",2003
6,"Ghost Ship is by no means the worst horror i have ever seen in fact some parts of this film are quite entertaining, the problem seems to be some of the poor digital computer special affect that make this film look like a bit of a B Movie. Some of the affects are good expecially the opening scene where we see the crewe of the ship killed by a steel rope.The acting is ok and the characters are good so that when they are picked off one by one ,you care. There are a lot of question left unanswered though and in stages the scenes apear to have been put in any old order . If you like Horror and dont want a film you have to think about too much then i sugest you give this a go. 6 out of 10.",2004
5,"OK ghost story. The movie starts off with a VERY gruesome bloody opening with a whole ship full of people being killed in 1962. It then cuts to present day (well--2002) where a salvage crew is led to a deserted vessel (the same one from the beginning) and find there's something inside that wants them. Dead bodies are discovered, doors open and close (and lock) by themselves and a creepy girl ghost watches over all of it.",2006
5,"Finally, a breath of fresh air. There's been downpours of such ""horror"" films like Darkness Falls, They, and Secret Window, and it's nice to see a movie that sets up its characters in a chilling manner, slowly letting us get to like them, and then the horror turning on us in a subtle yet horrifying manner that gives us nightmares. The movie I'm talking about hasn't actually come out yet, and will probably never be released. I'll bet you thought I was talking about Ghost Ship, right? Ghost Ship is not a movie like that; in fact, it's the complete opposite of what horror films were in their peak in the 70s and 80s. That doesn't automatically mean it's a terrible film. It's just not great.",2004
6,"The oceans of this world still keep a lot of secrets for themselves. We are able to fly to the moon, but we don't know everything about our own planet yet. This is of course also the reason why there are so many mysterious stories and legends about ships, airplanes... that have vanished in the thin air (think of the Bermuda triangle). Is anything about those stories true? Perhaps, but probably not. But that doesn't mean of course that this can't be a good source of inspiration for a new movie.",2005
7,"While this isn't a great film it wasn't terrible either. It suffers somewhat from having an opening scene which is the most shocking in the whole film; after seeing all but one person dancing on a ship's deck sliced in half by a cable it is hard to produce more action of that level. I think it would have been better to save this scene for later in the film, we saw part of it again in flashback later anyway.",2009
9,"(***Contains Spoilers***) Okay, just to say, Ghost Ship has one of the gruesomest opening sequences I've ever seen. It's really weird because as the opening credits are rolling, there is this happy music playing (the music from the song Francesca is singing), and the credits are this hot pink color and are in this fancy writing, and the next thing you know, people are being sliced up by a cable and their bodies are splitting and falling apart. I thought that that was pretty creative though, just to sort of trick you in a way. I almost thought I was at the wrong theater. Steve Beck has a unique way of giving a good feeling to his movies, but in a scary way. Like Thirteen Ghosts, with all those flashes and images of ghosts. But, yes, the opening sequence was very gruesome. The acting in this film was very good, with Julianna Margulies (TV's ER), Gabriel Byrne (Stigmata), and Desmond Harrington (who reminded me of and looks a lot like Edward Norton). Everyone there did a very well job. I think that after this, Julianna Margulies should move more into movies than television. One thing I really liked about this film was that it was very original. I mean, you don't see a haunted ocean liner movie much. It's usually the normal teen slasher movies, which some are okay, but they can get old. Mark Hanlon's story was brilliant though. Ghost Ship is probably the scariest movie of 1999-2002, besides The Ring which was also really scary. The only one thing that disappointed me a slight bit was the ending. At the ending, Jack (Desmond Harrington) is seen by Julianna Margulie's character when she is taken into the ambulence car. He is seen taking the gold onto another ship and then she screams and the credits roll??? I had wished the ending had just been that Maureen had gotten into the ambulence and was saved. But, they left it open for an optional sequel. I don't know if they will make one or they just wanted to let you know that evil can't die, which is portrayed in a lot of horror movies, such as in the Halloween series. All in all, I think that Ghost Ship was very well done and is extremely underrated. Any horror fan has to see this film. I give Ghost Ship a 9 out of 10.",2002
7,"The Dark Castle production company founded by Robert Zemeckis, Gilbert Adler and Joel Silver churned out a few low-brow horrors at the beginning of the last decade before producing broader, more mainstream flicks like RockNRolla and Unknown. Among the better of these schlockfests was Ghost Ship, a maritime horror set in the bleak Bearing Straight. A salvage crew featuring the underused Gabriel Byrne (replacing Brian Cox) and the lovely Julianna Margulies set out on a mission to find a mysterious floating behemoth only to discover that it's the 40-year lost Antonia Garza, a cruise ship that vanished without a trace.",2011
7,"It's all aboard for spooky thrills and gory spills in Ghost Ship, a slick supernatural horror from director Steve Beck (who brought us the equally polished Thir13en Ghosts) that launches itself at full steam ahead with a particularly memorable opening scene—an entire room of cruise-ship passengers are graphically sliced in half when a metal cable whips across the dance-floor.",2009
6,"This story, with a luxury cruise liner, that has been, floating out in the Behring Sea, since well, 1962 is eerie in itself, this ship is so large and so grandly made that it would decimate practically anything in it's wayward path, at very least. But when it comes to finding this lost at sea vessel, this salvage crew is in for a major surprise. ",2007
10,I first saw this movie on television and I was terrified. The dance floor scene where everyone was sliced was disgusting. The characters were good. The thing I loved most was the atmosphere of the sunken ship. The whole sight of it was chilling. All the gore was shocking. The snyopis was quite interestking. It was so scary and unexpected when the crew attempted to take the gold and ended having their small boat blown up by ghost power. I was surprised that Ferriman was the real villain in the story. The part where the spirits of the ship flew up to heaven looked so real. The ending confused me though. When Epps was in the ambulance why was ferriman boarding the ship? I thought he died in the explosion before the ship sank. The ending is kind of unnecessary. Overall I recommend this movie to any Horror/Thriller fan.,2009
10,"This is one of my all time favorite movies. No matter how many times I watch it, I figure out things I didn't get before. This movie is so much different than a lot of horror flicks out these days. It relies on the story, not gore. ",2005
10,"I have to admit, the only reason I even rented the movie was because of Julianna Margulies. I wasn't even sure if I would like it but by the end I was so impressed, it became my new favorite movie. Filmmakers today ""try"" to make good horror films but they usually follow in the footsteps of Halloween and Friday The 13th and totally bomb! This one had me in awe the whole time with the thrills, suspense and even laughs (yes, the cast is quite funny). This is the best horror flick of the past decade!",2003
1,"Why, oh, why did I actually pay eight dollars for this sloppily written, sloppily made, sloppily acted movie?  This is a movie not even worth the few bucks I shell out for the usual B movies I rent at my local straight -to-video shop.",2003
8,"Yet another variation on the ""switching bodies"" theme (Freaky Friday, Like Father Like Son, etc). This one was different, though, in that it involved a transgender switch and that, along with convincing acting by Rob Schneider, made it work. A little slow to start, but once it got going, I found myself laughing repeatedly throughout. A comedy well worth watching for lots of laughs.",2003
8,"First off let it be said, I'm a pretty big fan of comedies. I rather enjoyed Schneider's 1st film Deuce Bigelow, but gagged at the supreme awfulness of the Animal. The script to the Hot Chick is surprisingly good and well-organized (though it's premise is basically a raunchier riff on 80s body switch movies like vice-versa and freaky friday without any moralizing). It may not be original (similar to my other favorite comedy so far this year, old school) and it may not win any oscars , but it's funny, follows an established formula well, and doesn't deteriorate in the third act like a lot of comedies I've seen as of late into moralizing or seemingly tacked on drama. Rob Schneider and Anna Farris are incredibly funny together. Watch for a cameo by Adam Sandler. If youre in the mood for citizen kane or next year's oscar winners, look elsewhere. If you're in the mood for good, dumb, fairly raunchy fun to watch with a couple of friends - this movie's great.",2003
10,"I'll never forget the first time I saw this movie... I was at home, a bit bored, so I looked through the TV-listings and saw that this movie was coming on in a few minutes. I remembered having seen the trailer and was mildly interested, so since nothing else was on I decided to give it a chance, and... oh-my-God! From beginning to end I was laughing so hard I almost couldn't breathe. It was a long time since I was so pleasantly surprised by a comedy. Rob Schneider is a bloody comic genius. His portrait of a high-school cheerleader trapped inside a man's body is such a bullseye! Movie critics around the world may say that this is garbage, but it's really become one of my all-time favorite comedies. I just love it.",2006
9,"I wasn't really looking forward to this movie at all.  I haven't seen a lot of Rob Schneider, but what little I did see was usually grossout.  Needless to say I was expecting more of that with this little flick.",2002
6,"A very popular girl named Jessica(Rachel McAdams)accidently switches body with a man who is also a criminal(Rob Schneider)because of a pair of magical earrings. Now Jessica is trapped in a man's body and along with her best friend April(Anna Faris)she must find her body before it's too late but on the good side, Jessica learns a lot about herself, her family and her friends that she did not know before. I didn't have any high expectations for this movie but surprisingly it wasn't so bad and it had a few very funny moments. Oh, and by the way, Anna Faris is the real hot chick in this movie! Anyways, I would give The Hot Chick 6.5/10.",2003
7,"I enjoyed ""The Hot Chick.""  What can I say, it is a guilty pleasure.  When I went to see it I figure it may be amusing but I found myself laughing quite often during the movie.  Rob Schneider was very good in the role of the female who ends up in the body of an older man.  Anne Faris and Rachel McAdams are quite good in the supporting roles.",2003
6,"Jessica Spencer (Rachel McAdams from ""Mean Girls"") heists a pair of earrings from an tribal shop at the mall. After a run-in with another robber at a gas station (Rob Schneider), she loses one earring from the set. Turns out these jewelery pieces are magical and allow body-switching. We're dealing with a bad news/good news scenario here. the bad new being that the writer is the same responsible for ""The Animal"" travesty. The good news is this is considerably better. However, Anna Faris shouldn't make any more comedies, in every single comedy I've seen her in she is capable of a whole range of.. ONE expression, that would be being shocked/ Surprised, which would be fine if she didn't use it about 50 times per movie. But if gay stereotypes, fat jokes, and dick humor is your cup of tea By all means help yourself. You know what? I probably made it sound better than it is actually. It all honesty, this is merely an alright film even if it does feel a bit tame for a Schneider movie.",2005
8,"How can someone not think that this movie was funny?  I laughed so hard numerous times in this movie, but my husband was not impressed... Maybe it's a chick flick?  I don't know.  I'm 35 years old and I am not a big fan of Rob Schnieder, but this was hysterical.  My 60 year old dad and I were laughing about it over the phone this weekend talking about the bathroom part, so it can't be only funny to us females.",2003
9,"Once again, I've rented a Rob Schneider movie expecting it to be the STUPIDEST movie in existence and being pleasantly surprised.

A popular girl who takes things for granted named Jessica steals some cursed earrings from a store in the mall while with her hot girl-friends. They go to a gas station that's being robbed by Clive Maxtone. Clive pretends to be the gas station employee. Somehow, she drops an earring and Clive finds it. The next day, Jessica finds out she's switched bodies with Clive. She tries to tell her best friend April about it, but she doesn't believe her at first. Throughout the movie, a lot of hilarious situations happen such as Jessica trying to use the restroom standing up, and getting her boyfriend to believe. Across town, Clive is in Jessica's body and taking advantage of the situation by becoming a stripper and making more money. Later, Jessica learns some valuable lessons. If you have a great sense of humor, you'll love THE HOT CHICK!!!",2008

10,"I actually became curious of seeing this film on DVD because of all the negative comments on the IMDB. I finally got it. `The Hot Chick' is a nice little comedy with its heart in the right place, about diversity and tolerance, which shows a girl falling in love with her girlfriend in a man's body, a Korean mother trying to win back the affection of her trendy, outwardly African-American daughter, a guy going after a guy and even an eight-year old boy wearing high heel shoes. I can understand how it could get quite a few bigots' panties tangled in a knot.  Times have not changed much since (was it only two months ago?) `Boat Trip' died at the box office for roughly the same reasons.",2003
10,"This movie is really funny! You need to see if you have the least bit of the sixth sense know as the sense of HUMOR!  People who can't laugh at this movie make me think if they can laugh at anything.  If you take yourself so serious that you won't allow yourself to laugh then go watch a JLO movie and call me when your aren't busy watching prime-time TV.  All the best comedy's are goofy, and this one's no exception, but it is a great comedy.See for yourself. Of course, that's just my opinion, I could be wrong.",2002

10,"In my opinion, I thought this movie was HILARIOUS. There were a ton of things that really had me laughing loudly like their facial expressions or when April (I think?) says something about having pepper spray on her key chain and then pulls out this gigantic clump of key rings and frantically tries to search for it. For some reason, I thought it was so funny. Surprisinly...it also had me kind of anxious to find out what happened in the end. I saw it on TV and during the commercials I was dying to find out what was going to happen. The plot is kind of strange, but what would you do if you switched bodies with the opposite sex? Yeah, makes ya think, don't it?",2006

So what in the Earth made her accept working in this piece of garbage called Panic Room? Forest Whitaker is a great actor too. I cannot believe both of them appear here! I would give no stars to this movie, but these 2 great actors make me save their performance.",2006
10,"Way ahead of it's time. If you can come up with a story based in a single room and make it as engaging and exciting as this one... you deserve to be frozen and preserved for future teaching of inspiring film makers. This is a fantastic film and I'm glad Jodie Foster was available for the lead when Nicole Kidman got knocked up and bailed. I loved the off-character casting of Jared Leto and the unbelievable casting of Dwight Yoakam... DWIGHT YOAKAM. Everything worked. Another great, and yet again... underrated film by David Fincher. How long is it going to take for an established directed like Fincher to take a chance and roll the dice on trying to make a script like this work again? ...No one has the guts.",2009
5,"The acting and cinematography in this film are excellent.  (Jodie Foster and Forest Whitaker are particularly good.)  But, this is one of those movies where everyone is SCREAMING at the screen to do some really obvious things. (I have included some examples in the ""SPOILER"" section below.)  I know that this film is trying to lure you in and ""feeeeeel"" Jodie's pain, but when she can't even make simple, obvious choices to help herself I can no longer empathize with her.  I think, ""She deserves to be stuck in there, she's just too stupid to be out roaming the streets with the rest of us.""",2002

3,WARNING **** CONTAINS SPOILERS,2002
1,"David Fincher is a magician of sorts, he should work in a circus. He does things with his gadgets that are quite extraordinary, but, has absolutely no clue about drama. Based on a tiny, thin, invisible script he builds a theme park ride that gets very tired very soon. All of David Fincher's films look terrific, they all have ambitious intentions but they collapse under the poverty of the scripts. ""Seven"" is the better one, but still, after you get over the magnificent photography, you're left with a formula used and abused for years. ""Fight Club"" has a first hour that makes you think in you're in for a real treat. With superb performances by Norton, Pitt and Bonham Carter and then a massive let down. ""The Game"" was mystical, powerful, mysterious and spine chilling for the whole first part but then... They all have that same common denominator, opportunistic, thoughtless and unimaginative writing. That alone alienates the bulk of their potential audiences. Now ""Panic Room"" the most blatant example of what I'm trying to convey. No matter how brilliant the camera work, where are the characters? Where is the drama? What was with the husband? What about that semi visit by the police? Unforgivable. I should advice Mr. Fincher to look at films with less gadgetry, even less ambition and take note. From William Wyler's ""Desperate Hours"" to David Miller's ""Midnight Lace"" or quite simply look at the sort of writers Alfred Hitchcock worked with, without them Mr. Hitchcock would have been a director of the past not the legendary master for all seasons.",2004
1,"I am a fan of Fincher.  I love Fight Club, I like Seven and my opinions for his other films vary.  His direction was so absurdly horrible, I couldn't help but to be distracted.  Almost every shot was unmotivated toward the action; the camera was subjective to the house more than the characters, so the visual aspects dominated the film.  Further more, it is my opinion that the visual aspects of the film (Fincher's trademark), were nothing to behold.  The lens choices were terrible; extreme wide shots of intense drama on charcters made certain scenes come across phony; the lack of depth of field and very wide lenses, caused shot after shot to have so much 'dead space' in the frame, it seemed painfully obvious the reason was for a claustrophobic mood. As a fan of Fincher, it was a slap in the face to have the amount of product placement abundant (the Cocca Cola scene in the beginning is cringe inducing), when his previous 'Fight Club' basically negated his aesthetic choices in this film.  The screenplay was brain dead and gimmicky, mood was so contrived it was shoved down your throat.  Maybe Fincher should calm down a bit, understand the meaning of the term subtly and not be so in our face. Just because the camera moves through objects doesn't mean it is well directed, motivation is the key and that was absent.",2002
1,"At best, Panic Room is mediocre entertainment.  A part from the slick direction.  Panic has a bland plot, annoying characters, especially the girl, who I couldn't tell was a boy or a girl at first.  Stupid situations, how she could get in and out of the room so easily.",2002
8,This was a very suspenseful and exciting thriller from David Fincher who is responsible for my all time favourite film which is Seven. This new film has another very good performance by Jodie Foster but the acting standout of the film has to go to Dwight Yoakam with awesome performance as Raoul. The only problem i had with this film was its ending which was a bit of a let down but did not really spoil the film at all.,2002
1,"This film is utter utter total crap, I couldn't even be bothered to watch the end of it, though half did (the end is the ultimate in crap endings). Its the kind of film playing on the siege mentality done to perfection in 'zombies dawn of the living dead', except that in this film, the loose ends and unreality get to the point where halfway through you just wanna scream at the screen and go 'oh yer - how realistic that is - not!'. To be honest I half expected donald duck and mickey to knock at the door.",2002
3,"Damn shame if you ask me! Jodie Foster refused to be the president of the jury at the Cannes Film Festival to do this. Maybe it looked good on the page and it certainly looks good on the screen, specially the opening credits but there is very little else to recommend. David Fincher does some dizzying things with the camera but the script by the very rich David Koepp is just plain amateurish. I was so frustrated by the waste of everything here. The characters seem a facsimile of characters from other, better, movies without being able to nail that extra dimension that could make them, at least, watchable. The husband, the cops even the baddies are all laughable. Jodie Foster has a couple of moments and she's one of my heroes anyway but that's maybe why I felt so annoyed by this movie, so much so that I decided to vent my frustration writing this comment. If you love Jodie Foster, avoid this for her sake.",2007
7,"Director David Fincher lays out a tight simple thriller. It takes place all in and around the house.

Only Meg and her daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart) get there first.",2013
3,"Panic Room was one of the lamest ""thrillers"" I've ever seen.  I scare easily, and I was never on the edge of my seat.  The bathrooms in the theater I visited were far more of a horror than the Panic Room.  Jodie Foster wasn't given a chance to shine in this mediocre film. I felt the movie lacked an interesting plot.  I was expecting numerous plot twists with this movie being a ""thriller,"" but I was sorely disappointed.  Just a warning for anyone who plans on seeing the movie, I don't think this is a spoiler, but I guess it was one of the only ""surprises"" in the movie... the girl stuck in the room has diabetes and needs her insulin!  I didn't see that one coming a mile away, not even after we were shown her insulin monitor in one of the first scenes.  I'm surprised Jodie Foster didn't start having an asthma attack, or even better a ""panic attack"" as she worried about her daughter because that's the sort of lame thing that would happen in this movie. Panic Room was one of the most predictable and unentertaining movies I have ever seen.  I came into the movie with high expectations, and I left glad that I had only wasted $5.25 on the movie instead of $8.",2002
1,"Plse note: spoilers below! I would have considered this movie to be a mediocre to fair thriller if not for one major flaw which ruined the whole movie for me.  This flaw was the injection scene.  Anyone who knows anything about diabetes knows that when someone is suffering from low blood sugar and verging on going into a coma the last thing you would do is inject them with insulin (which would just cause them to go into a coma that much faster and very likely kill them). Even if the syringe contained a sugar solution the film-makers should have known that to be the least bit effective this would have to have been injected directly into the blood stream not into stomach tissue.  Not only is it insulting to diabetics everywhere that the film-makers couldn't even be bothered to get the facts right about this deadly disease, but this depiction could conceivably result in a tragedy.  Anyone using this scene as a basic for trying to help someone who is suffering from low blood sugar could end up killing them.  Other minor flaws with the movie: how could Forest Whitaker's character have know what Jodie Foster's character was doing when she was trying to ignite the gas, how likely is it that Jodie Foster's character would know how to reconnect the phone, pushing a light sofa in front of the door is not terribly effective in blocking the door which is made clear when Jodie Foster's character had no problem later in the movie in getting the front door open, etc., etc., etc.  Very poorly thought out and executed.  Shame on you guys.",2003
2,1. That says it all! 2. It is like home Alone 2 3. That make is worse than Home Alone 1 - the original 4. There was no sound on her security system so she could have told the police at the door what was going on. 5. She could have turned off the electricity so they couldn't drill the safe. 6.

I can't believe this...I only have 6...OK I actually just saw the last maybe 45 minutes...but it was really bad.

3,"The majority of the movie was not genius or even well thought out...but there was an element of suspense in most of the scenes that I actually did enjoy(although I wonder if it's genuine suspense, or if you feel that way because the actors are doing all but *saying* that's how you should be feeling...) I would have rated the film higher if the ending wasn't such a LETDOWN!!! They waste all this time making Forrest Whitaker into a good-bad guy, with no cherry on top! Does he die? Does he get arrested? Does Jodi save him? All we're left with is Jodi's ""I just smelled a fart"" look, then BAM! On to finding another flat! No payoff! Sure, some films like to leave the ending open to interpretation...but I don't think this qualifies as a successful attempt at that. Characters are supposed to grow and change by the film's end...in this film we're left at the exact same place we started...with Jodi and her kin seeking a home. Blah, why bother with the rest of the film if their greatest driving force in life is finding a Brownstone? The more I think about it, the more I dislike this movie. I want my two hours back.",2005

9,"This is obviously aimed at the same market as Monsters Inc and Shrek, but is different in its less cartoony feel (despite the deliberately cartoony characteristics of the lead creatures).

In a movie theatre surrounded by children who were on spring break, there was not a sound so I know the children all liked it. There parents also seemed engaged. The death and apparent death of characters brought about the appropriate gasps and comments. Hopefully people realize this movie was made for kids. As such, it was successful although I liked it too. Personally I liked the Scrat!!",2002
7,"I'm always way behind the curve on these animated features, this one by about a dozen years. I don't know how that happens but time does go by. Maybe because I've seen so many films, I have to conclude that the story here wasn't very original or exciting, but on the plus side, young kids watching will probably get the message about teamwork, friendship, loyalty and integrity. Animation wise, I thought there was room for improvement with some of the characters but that was offset by the vivid use of color. I did get a kick out of the Tae-Kwan-Dodo bird gimmick, that was pretty funny. Overall, a passable story and recommended for the younger set, so if you have youngsters in the family, treat them by watching along side.",2014
8,"Around the early 21st century computer animated family films had really taken off. Through the recent hits of Shrek and Monster's Inc, people started seeing money in this business. So in Blue Sky's first ever animated film they may have not been very original but the film known as Ice Age has enough charm and laughs to be very acceptable.",2012

Spite of the fact that 'Ice Age'has many flaws and scientific errors,like humans,sabers,dinosaurs and mammoths living at the same period, and even the location of where the story passes(looks North America,but has some characteristics from Iceland for example) we can have fun even so.(unless you are very severe!)

10,"I thought that Ice Age was an excellent movie! As a woman of 30, with no children, I still seem to really enjoy these humorous, witty animated movies. Sid is the best character I have seen in some time, better than Bartok in Anastasia (although he was really humorous, and I did not think that his character could be matched or even beaten) and even more humorous than Melman in Madagascar. I have seen the movie at least 15 times (I own it obviously) and I quote the movie at work (on many occasions...yes,still). My favourite scene is the part where Sid says ""Oh, oh, oh, I love this game!"" and Sid and Manny continue to figure out what the squirrel is trying to tell them about the ""tigers""...""Pack of wolves, pack of bears, pack of fleas, pack of whiskers, pack of noses, pack a derm?, pack of lies, pack of troubles, pack a wallop, pack of birds, pack of flying fish..."" or however that part goes! That is THE funniest part about the whole movie, although I also really enjoyed the humour behind ""putting sloths on the map"" and many other parts as well. The only animated movie that can remotely compare to Ice Age is ""Brother Bear"".",2006
8,"Ice Age is a good movie, there is no doubt about that. As with most popular animation flicks, it appeals to all ages and has a decent enough mix of humour to keep all the family entertained. I loved Ice Age growing up and have memories of it being one of the favourite animated movies of all time. Having re-watched it at weekend, 7 or 8 years after previously viewing it, I felt a little flat. Sid seriously carries the film, many of the jokes and the majority of the dialogue comes through him. The supporting cast all do a pleasant job, Manny is entertaining and they do share some good chemistry but the film relies heavily on Sid's presence.",2015

So, I went to the theatre having so-so expectations, and I walked out smiling. But... now I look at it today, and occasionally I find myself reaching for a tissue. The story is so well told that I found myself laughing at most of Sid's antics, and Scrat's, which have never gotten old for this movie by the way... ever. But, now being old enough to understand, I also found that the implied, but still tragic, death of Manny's family being revealed is one of the saddest moments in this beautifully animated film.

Sure, it's not as glamorous as a Disney production(besides, it is Fox's 1st attempt at a full length CG movie) but it's got immense heart and on some occasions(like the look in Manfred's eyes after we see the sad glimpse of his past) I found myself on the verge of tears. But when they reunited the baby with its father I just couldn't hold them in anymore. A movie that has no trouble walking on the thin line of sappy and cliché and manages to bring more than the best out of it; the end result being one of the most touching animated creations I have ever seen. Great funny looking characters that quickly grow on you(and great voice talents as well) and many funny memorable scenes, especially from Scrat's behalf make the movie more than enough reason to give it a go.

The hour lesson after John's death in real-life struck home to me. I lost my father at 17 years old and could sympathize and understand their pain and agony.

10,"For myself, watching 25th Hour was sort-of like taking a palm reading. Noticing one line, representative of a life-path, stretches out long and far, while another line branches off and stops short in the middle of your palm. You question which life path will you take, and which are you currently on now. Are you one the short one or the long one? You question the various choices and decisions that you made in the past, and which life-line have those choices and decisions ultimately lead you down. In a round-about way, the three characters in Spike Lee's 25th Hour are struggling with these same kind of questions. Based on a novel by David Benioff, the film is essentially three people struggling with the choices that they have made in their past, and the choices they are to make in the future -- and which path will it ultimately lead them down.",2004
8,"Having seen Spike Lee's ""25th Hour"", I must say I was pleased.  Lee's plot is both involving and heartfelt, showing the essence of reality.  His script is fresh, yet somewhat slow in spots. His characters shine, however, in a truly believeable tale of consequence. Edward Norton, in another masterful performance, shows an almost frightening level of genuine human emotion as the protagonist Montgomery Brogan. The supporting cast consisting of Philip Seymour Hoffman, Barry Pepper, and veteran Brian Cox provide a solid foundation  that allows Lee's story to flow freely.  While most would consider this tale a literal one, take note:  It is quite apparent, through subtlety and the rather obvious ""restroom mirror scene"" that Spike Lee has a message he wants to get across.  What I think makes ""25th Hour"" so appealing on a theoretical level is the fact that his message is surprisingly open-ended; allowing the individual viewer to decide what he or she wants to retain from the film.  This is a genuine film experience; a haunting dose of reality.",2003

I couldn't believe how much I fell in love with this movie, it's honestly one of my new favorite movies, it's intelligent, intense, and greatly written. Edward Norton pulls off an incredible performance and truth be told I couldn't believe he didn't get a nomination at least for this movie, I don't know 25th Hour just didn't get enough notice, but this is a great movie and a very moving story.",2004

Which Lee handles with utmost care and outstanding precision.",2007
9,"This is definitely Spike Lee at the top of his game!  `25th Hour' is a purely character-driven drama filled with engaging, complex characters and sharp dialogue.  I like how Spike allowed the scenes to play out, without being too concerned about dampening the pacing.  I'm sure some will complain (and this probably explains why it wasn't a big success) that the film is boring and slow-moving.  If they do, that's probably because audiences are so used to watching movies with a million cuts in one scene, and more time emphasized on action and sex scenes than character development.  The characters were so well-developed that I felt a deep connection with each of them.  It's rare nowadays that I really get sucked into a film, and this was one of those rare cases.  It might also have to do with the fact that I'm familiar with many of these types of characters in real life.  You have the Barry Pepper character, who's this smooth-talking playboy who ends sleeping with a ton of women, despite the fact that he's harsh and not very likable. And there's the Philip Seymour Hoffman character, who's a lonely, average-looking guy, who's alienated from society because he doesn't look like an Adonis.  It's a harsh reality that handsome guys with nice bodies get away with being complete jerks and still maintain an active dating life, while average-looking guys can have great personalities and women will be repulsed by them, but it is indeed a reality.  Sure, it isn't right for Hoffman to be lusting after one of his underage students, but I'm sure if he were ten times better looking, people wouldn't be as disgusted-because God knows that teachers sleeping with their students is sweeping the globe like an epidemic.

The drag becomes a little too heavy after an hour into the film, despite the strong performances of Norton and Co. The movie could have ended on several occasions, yet it persists in slowly pushing forward and resulting in a rather unsatisfactory ending, an ending which the efforts put in by the actors do not deserve. As mentioned, the cast is outstanding, with Barry Pepper being my actor of the movie. He outshines everyone with his unabashed attitude and utterly convincing portrayal of one good friend being afraid to show his true loyalty in a society that often cynically rewards good with evil.",2003

I guess I don't get it because I'm not a New Yorker (and not an American), but when they go for cheap emo-drama with yet some more references to the 9/11 attacks, that's really annoying.

1,"Norton plays 'Monty' Brogan who's reflecting on his life in the last hours before going to jail for 7 years. What the film lacks in plot it makes up with rambling conversations Norton has with various people, including himself. It's a mystery why anyone should care. Norton's character isn't particularly interesting, likable or even fleshed out and neither is anyone else in the movie. His predicament seems merely a given. Three hours of random flashbacks, drawn-out conversation and barely audible bar scenes does not make for an engaging pastime even though the film sports some very nice visuals.

8,"INSOMNIA is not only the third film of acclaimed director Christopher Nolan (his first two were FOLLOWINGS and MEMENTO), but also a film that is able to intertwine the acting talents of three Academy Award winners.  Al Pacino plays a celebrated cop who is asked to work on the case of a murdered girl in Alaska.  Hilary Swank plays the local law enforcement who has her eyes on making a big case.  Robin Williams plays a troubled Alaskan writer.  Without giving anything away, INSOMNIA is definitely worth it.  Some may see it, and be disappointed.  One way to steer away from this failure is think of INSOMNIA as a psychological thriller rather than a ""Shoot 'em up"" thriller. INSOMNIA is story about loyalty and human emotion.  Don't get me wrong, the movie is thrill-packed, but let's just say--You don't need blood and gore to make the audience members be on the edge of their seats (which I was). INSOMNIA hits all of its points including acting, directing, screenwriting, and cinematography.  It's a first class thriller with great characters.  On a side note...Pacino is worthy of an Oscar for his performance, Williams is equally excellent, and Swank also deserves recognition for complete scope of acting.  A job well done by these three actors, and especially the man behind the curtain, Christopher Nolan!",2002

The primary story is about the police investigation of the murder of a high-school girl in a small Alaskan town. Through the pull of old acquaintances and political necessity, two LA homicide detectives (Pacino and Martin Donovan) are dispatched to the scene to help the locals. The political necessity concerns a graft investigation in which the two LA detectives are key suspects. One is thinking of copping a plea, so they are spirited out of LA to avoid the investigative light. Then they find themselves in the 24-hour day of the Alaskan summer where the two plot lines collide; the murder investigation and the graft. And what a collision it is. ",2002
9,"I was really looking forward to this film, and I'm glad to say that I wasn't the least bit disappointed.  First of all, I was glad to see Al Pacino on screen again.  It seems like it's been a while since I've seen him on screen.  I think the last film he was in was ""Any Given Sunday.""  Pacino yet again delivers a brilliant performance, strapping the audience in for a wild ride through the emotionally scarred mind of Detective Will Dormer.  It seemed like I could feel his every emotion throughout the course of the movie.  Because this is a character-driven story that revolves around Dormer, his pain, anguish and guilt on account of accidentally taking his partner's life, constant insomnia and subsequent threats by his nemesis, played by Robin Williams as a writer of trashy detective novels who's fascinated by Dormer and blackmails him by threatening to spill out the secret of Dormer shooting his partner.  As for Robin Williams, he is fully convincing as the reclusive novelist/murderer of a 17-year-old girl.  I suspected, from the trailers, that he'd play a serial killer.  I wouldn't exactly classify his character as a serial killer, but he is the antagonist and a murderer and Williams plays the role perfectly, never underplaying it and never overplaying it.  He could've went over-the-top, playing a totally ruthless killer who cackles at the thought of murdering someone in cold blood.  Though he's not our sympathetic character, you do feel sympathy for him at times.  And I like how the story creates this little cat-and-mouse game between the two characters, each one plagued by skeletons in the closet.  Oscar-winner Hilary Swank delivers another fine performance, and I was stunned to see how amazingly attractive she looks, after having seen her gender-bending role as Brandon Teena in ""Boys Don't Cry.""",2002
8,I used to think that nobody could come close to Robert De Niro when it comes to who was the best actor in Hollywood but as the years went by he started to pick some real Turkeys and a in the mean while an old hand was gradually taking the crown from De Niro and that is Al Pacino. In Insomnia he has picked another cracker of a film that although not fast paced is brilliantly acted and is very watchable. Hilary Swank is superb as is Robin Williams and its refreshing to see him taking a serious role instead of sentimental trash like Patch Adams but as per usual it is Al Pacino who steals the show. He plays an insomniac Cop who gets intangled in a murder case and gets into trouble after accidently killing his partner . I cant think of an actor who looks more tired than Pacino anyway so he was perfect for the role. The story is OK but to be honest the film is more about the performances than the plot. 8 out of 10,2003
8,"Al Pacino's acting once again is a highlight of a film he's in. He has the capacity to dominate a film with his presence. In this re-make of the Norwegian film, Pacino is excellent as a good-yet-tainted policeman who starts to unravel after not sleeping for four or five days. The Alaskan summer, with light 24 hours of day, can do that to visitors",2006

The fact is, Nolan is among the greatest film-makers in the world and he is going to keep making new classics for the years to come, and I'm already looking forward to ""Inception"" in 2010. In 2002, he directed a remake of the Norweigian film of the same name called ""Insomnia"", and I gotta say, it's the best psychological thriller I've ever seen and it even surpasses ""The Silence of the Lambs"" big time.",2009

Al Pacino is loved by everyone who has seen him as ""Michael Vito Corleone"" in The Godfather Trilogy or the ruthless ""Tony Montana"" in Scarface. These films were the highlights of his career and even though he isn't as memorable as Will Dormer in Insomnia, it is hard not to give him an honorable mention. Insomnia is referred to as a ""Cat and Mouse"" thriller and it proved that it is one because of the whole chase thing between Will Dormer, a cop, and a local writer who goes by the name of Walter Finch, a man who is under the suspicion of killing a teen. This is proved even more when there is an actual ground chase between them two on the logs in the flowing river. That scene was full of heart pounding action and added a bit of intrigue that made you appreciate the film a little bit more. The film would have been unknown to me if there weren't the three Oscar winners, Al Pacino, Robin Williams, and Hilary Swank that made this thriller for what it is, also if Christopher Nolan hadn't directed it. He is truly a great director. Steven Spielberg has to watch out for the might of Nolan. Al Pacino was absolute and admirable in Insomnia therefore making him the best actor in the whole film. His role as a tough cop was fascinating and hypnotizing. Robin Williams, who portrays Walter Finch, was not as great as Al's however he still doesn't disappoint. This is not Robin Williams best role but it MIGHT be his most evilest role in his ""Evil Trilogy"". Hilary Swank's character Ellie Burr made you think that she was unnecessary but as the film reaches its climax you realize that she plays an important part. Swank's performance could not rival against her other roles in ""Million Dollar Baby"" or ""Boy's don't Cry"" however she is agreeable but not fun to watch. The films chilly, or spooky, atmosphere is the best in any movie, I have ever seen so far. It just makes the films setting really home-sweet-home.

The funny thing is I didn't realize how good it was until about four years later. Time has a way of blurring your memory and mine is more blurred than most. You can't forget this one however because it sticks in your head and won't come out. The cinematography is superb and the lines are, in several places, quite unique and memorable. I will always remember at the end, feeling Dormer's (Pacino) insomnia. Literally feeling it. And obviously, I've been there. I once went eight whole days without a night's sleep. Don't ask me how, but I did. And after that much sleeplessness, it begins to mess with you. I have only seen about ten minutes of the original film on which this film is based, not because I got bored and turned it off, but because I didn't realize what I was watching. If I had, I most certainly would have watched the whole thing. Robin Williams was an illogical but certainly credible, deserved, and welcome addition to this film, and anyone who says he plays something other than what he actually plays didn't pay close attention. He is always good for an unexpected performance. Do yourself a favor, study this film. Really study it. A true work of art if there ever was one on film.",2006
3,Movie Reviews =============,2007
7,"Although I don't think this is one of Christopher Nolan's strongest films, but it was still pretty good and had a good story which is what his films are mostly known for. One of the quotes from the movie is ""a good cop can't sleep because a piece of the puzzle is missing and a bad cop can't sleep cause his conscience won't let him"". And that is what the story is about while getting blackmailed by the killer who tries to convince the detective that they are both in the same situation. And if the end sometimes justify the means. Unfortunately the killer isn't the least bit interesting although the film starts off by making the killer seem like a interesting character. Although the film moves a bit slow at times, has a well woven plot that will keep most audiences intrigued from beginning to end with it's drama and suspense. The main reason I saw this is because it's a Christopher Nolan film and it didn't really disappoint.",2011
7,"I'm one of Christopher Nolan's biggest fans. I think he was best filmmaker in the past decade, and if he continues making highly innovative,different,engrossing and intense films like memento,Batman Begins,TDK and now Inception, he's going to have a claim to be one of the greatest directors of all time. He's certainly on his way there. This film is by no means lacking in creativity, but when you look at Nolan's other works, this is no doubt the odd one out, there is genre subversion with the classic dark noir scenes replaced by omnipresent sunlight. The plot is good,but not great. What really draws you in is Al Pacino showing his greatness as an actor with a brilliant rendition of William Dommer,the title character .A cat-and-mouse game between hero-cop-with- skeletons-in-his-closet-suffering-from-insomnia-and-guilt and criminal- with-ace-up-his-sleeve is intriguing and engaging. But so,Robin William's appearance somehow hurts the movie, who,despite his talent,gives an unusually lackluster performance. The movie then loses its pace and intensity,and I found my attention wandering,something I thought impossible during a Nolan Movie. The 24-day concept is new and refreshing,Hillary Swank also gives a solid performance. The first 1 hour was very promising.",2010
7,"""Insomnia"" is a thriller that has some big names attached to it: Al Pacino, Robin Williams & Hilary Swank; all designated as 'Academy Award Winner' on the movie poster. Director Christopher Nolan is also well-known, though his only Oscar nomination is for a co-screen writing credit.",2008
9,"Insomnia is directed by Christopher Nolan and written by Erik Skjoldbjærg and Nikolaj Frobenius (1997 screenplay). It stars Al Pacino, Robin Williams, Hilary Swank, Maura Tierney, Martin Donovan and Nicky Katt. Music is scored by David Julyan and cinematography by Wally Pfister. It's a remake of a 1997 Norwegian film of the same name.",2012
10,"This movie makes you realize why so many other movies fail to be scary...not enough psychological elements. What this movie does right is that it skips the gore, and blood, and over-the-top overacting crazed lunatics that seem the norm in horror movies.",2006
9,"I first watched this movie with a couple of friends. To be honest, I was expecting a teenage, slasher flick, I was proved wrong.",2008
10,"Before I saw The Ring, I used to think of horror movies as something about a supernatural (sometimes not supernatural) force that gobbles up people in bizarre series of deaths usually accompanied by blood and gore. Maybe I ought to blame it on my own selection of movies. But I realized that horror movies can have a deep and a decent story line after seeing The Ring.",2007
9,"The Ring did three things no film of late has done. It took the genre of Horror seriously without going over the top. It is derived from a superior story and translated to American film superbly, regardless of what the naysayers say. And, while it starts off typically, it ascends into a beautiful, darkling, twisted, genuinely creepy story, which holds you through to the end.",2007
9,"I saw this movie when I was only 13 and I didn't switch on the TV for 2 weeks after I saw this movie. I cursed my parents for taking me to watch it in the theatres, I was so afraid. After I actually lived for more than 2 weeks, I was feeling better and have watched it and The Ring 2 many times since then. The Ring 2 didn't match expectations. But that is my next review, I will explain in that. The Ring and The Sixth Sense were the movies which played a huge part in making me a fan of the horror genre. Gore Verbinski directs this movie which is a Japanese movie remake. This film and The Grudge spawned all those bad Asian remakes in the coming years.",2010
9,"My husband took me to see this film and when he said it was a horror I was expecting to sit through another of his kind of horror films i.e.stupid teenagers with lots of gratuitous blood, guts and violence thrown in. I was fortunately very mistaken! I have not seen the original ""Ringu"", which everyone keeps harping on about, but I am glad I saw this first as it is good not to have anything to compare it to. Taken by itself, I think it is a fantastic film. It's not everyone's cup of tea and the usual horror fans may think it slow, incomprehensible or just plain unscary. However, I loved the mystery and weirdness of it.",2003
9,"The Ring, an American remake of the Japanese film ""Ringu"", is in my honest opinion a spectacular and enthralling film. The writing, directing, performances and replay value are amazing in and of themselves. I especially love the premise, and I will review this movie as it's own film, not a remake. What really makes it wonderful is the incredible performances and suspense. I really love all the actors' and actresses' dedication and believability, there being very memorable deliverances of lines and scenes after the film is over. The suspense is top-notch, because of how well the movie is played out and how creepy and fun the material is, that I was both eyes on the screen every second. Naomi Watts is radiant and brilliant; the scenes where she slowly puts the pieces of the puzzle together, or uncovers something dark and haunting are haunting themself because of how marvelous she makes this material.",2008
7,"These last years, apart from the rendering of popular comic strips and the adaptation of TV series for the big screen, American cinema feels a vivacious interest for Oriental culture, especially the Japanese one. Quentin Tarantino's violent and hollow ""Kill Bill"" (2003/2004) was supposed to be an homage to the samurai movie (but I'm not a Tarantino buff by a long shot). In the derivative ""the Last Samurai"" (2003), Tom Cruise discovered the secrets and treasures of Japanese civilization while Sofia Coppola used the city of Tokyo as the backdrop for her triumphant ""Lost in Translation"" (2003). Gore Verbinski chose a more direct and easy way to get interested in Japanese culture: to make a remake of a Japanese movie which became a sleeper: ""Ringu"" (1998). Against all odds, he made a killing with it although he's an uneven director. ""Mousehunt"" (1997) was a formulaic but enjoyable comedy but ""the Mexican"" (2001) was a lame movie. Some friends had told me: ""don't watch ""the Ring"", it's a hokey movie"". I think they misjudged it and I found this supernatural thriller quite intriguing and gripping. It has enough commendable stuff in store to grab the audience. I haven't seen the original movie and so I will avoid any comparison.",2006
7,"This film is the American take on the Japanese original and while it absorbs its source material intact, it twists around its formula a bit in order to make it fit its new surroundings. The story is the same: a journalist, after losing her niece to a mysterious circumstance, investigates and discovers a cursed videotape, which gives a viewer only seven days to live.",2008
10,"After her niece and three of her niece's friends mysteriously die on the same night, at the same time, but in different circumstances, reporter Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts), hears the rumors of a video that when seen, ""curses"" the viewer so that they die in 7 days. She investigates the phenomenon with the aid of her ex, Noah Clay (Martin Henderson). They end up seeing the video. Can they figure out a solution in time?",2005
9,"My girlfriend and I saw the original in Japanese, and we both agree that the US version is much more suspenseful and scarier than the Japanese one, with the exception of some extraordinarily creepy sequences in the Japanese version. One of the small but significant changes from the original was that the Japanese version had the girl's face mostly hidden by her hair and she never makes eye contact, which I found more effective than Verbinski's treatment. The original also had one scene that I thought was a bit creepier than the remake, when the girl comes to attack the man. Other than that, the changes made were mostly positive.",2003
7,"Though I haven't yet seen 1998's ""Ringu"" (from Japan) - I certainly thought that 2002's ""The Ring"" (which was its American remake) was (as far as modern-day ghost stories go) a satisfyingly eerie tale of the supernatural. This film actually produced some very real and powerful chills without having to resort to grinding excessive, bloody gore into my face.",2016
5,It is surprising to say this movie didn't really scare me. The Ring is about a woman who comes across a video tape that seems to be causing the deaths of people who die seven days after viewing the tape. It's probably my own fault I waited too long to see this movie. I have seen so many horror movies that this film didn't really scare me. However that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it. It has a good story and some really effective imagery. I was not scared but I was pretty creeped out. In my opinion if you have yet to watch this film and if you are easily scared watch it. But if you are not easily scared watch this with a group of friends so they can get scared and you will have a good time with it. It does have its ups and downs but it was an okay horror movie.,2016
7,"After having seen both the original Japanese ""Ringu"" (1998) and its American remake ""The Ring"" (2002), I found the latter superior in almost every aspect (atmosphere, cinematography, effects, soundtrack, acting, pace), though the script is in the usual Frankenstein-style of contemporary U.S. horror films -- borrowed pieces from everywhere put together with visible stitches all over.",2003
1,"lately i've seen nothing but references to The Ring everywhere i go. people talk about it when they speak about their feelings and dreams, as if this movie were something thought-provoking and not just a crap of cheese. honestly, i've never seen something so cheesy in my life. the original wasn't the most fantastic thing in the box, but at least it wasn't too pathetic, over-acted and trying to be more high brow than the story is.",2003
8,"The Ring remains to this day one of the creepiest movies I have ever seen. It is not particularly violent, like all those cruddy (and the occasionally decent) slasher film. But honestly, is there anyone who doesn't get a chill running down their spines when they show those dead bodies with the gray skin and hollowed out eyes staring out at nothing. This movie honestly gave me a nightmare the night after I watched it.",2010
1,Absolutely unbelievable more and nothing really creepy about it at all just a bunch of psychobabble about some those running around terrorizing found it more of a sleeper film than anything horror involved. Its almost like the writers were stretching for a plot and couldn't quite grasp how to draw the viewer into it including me. After about 30 min of this film I really found the only horrific part about it was it wasn't over yet. Even the draw up to find out the reasoning for the terror occurring was more of a huge disappointment a complete waste of time. This film was more of a one time watch and never again I have better things to do then waste my time with garbage like this again.,2014
1,"It has to be understood as an offense to any savvy viewer who caught the Japanese version of the movie, 'Ringu'.",2003

The whole concept about a Latin family TV show really amazed me. I am surprised that finally Latinos have a good shot to be on TV. This show is probably one the best I've seen, it's funny, heartwarming, touchy, and nice.",2003
7,"when i saw commercials for this i was thinking ""NO WHAT HAS NICK AT NITE DONE!"" because it was taking up ""fresh prince"" slots. well, i still love the fresh prince. but george lopez is a surprisingly good show. i love how not-stereotypical benny is. carmen is a pretty good character, its really funny to see how stupid and overemotional she can be sometimes. i feel bad for the guy who plays max, he looks much younger then he actually is! but max is a fun character, and acted well. and yeah, angie is a little stereotypical, but she has her funny moments. ha ha george does have a big head! nah but he can be really good too. funny show! it definitely should be on more often then home improvement.",2007
6,"I started watching this show on Nick at Nite. It's pretty funny, and for me, better than Lopez's stand up. I have seen his stand up comedy live, but it is not as enjoyable as the show. At least in the show, there are elements of other aspects to life rather than just animosity towards white people.",2009
8,"George Lopez is a funny man even without the sitcom. The first episodes I saw of this too often made jokes at the expense of his mom. As I have watched this more, there has been more & more variety. No one on the cast is really safe from his wit now.",2007
10,From the beginning of the show Carmen was there. She was one of the best characters. Why did they get rid of her?! The show not the same as before. Its way worse.,2007
8,"George Lopez has a reputation as a washed-up, one-trick-pony kind of comedian. His shows keep getting canceled, so you'll really only see him as a voice actor in bad kids movies these days. But I'll always maintain, if nothing else, The George Lopez Show was comedy gold.",2014
10,"Today is one of my all time favorite shows to review. George Lopez. First, the cast of course. There's George, a father of 2 who is the manager of a factory. Angie, the wife who thinks pretty much everything George does is wrong. Ernie, George's best friend. Max and Carmen, the kids who get into a lot of trouble. Vic, Angie's dad who doesn't like George that much until season 3 or 4. And the funniest character is Benny, George's mom. Yeah, your basic sitcom characters, but they took the liberty to put some essential characters in there to make the show funnier. I've seen some reviews of people bashing the show saying its racist, but George or anyone doesn't make jokes about OTHER RACES, he makes them about HIS RACE. And the jokes, i don't see how they can be hurtful cuz Latinos are awesome, George is just poking a little fun. Let's compare those jokes to the show Everybody Hates Chris, which is an awesome show. They're being poking fun of the other race, which is considered racist. OK back to the show. The plots are sometimes your basic sitcoms, Benny hides something from George, a problem at the factory, or the kids. But all the plots are legitimate. They just revolve around the same thing, like a lot of good sitcoms like Drake and Josh or Malcolm in the Middle. So that wraps it up. George Lopez is a hilarious show, not racist, good plots, good characters. So if you hate the show, just do yourself a favor and die.",2010
10,"George Lopez never caught my interest in his stand up comedy and he still doesn't. But this show is a work of art. It's not ever show where the jokes keep you laughing every time you remember it (and jokes that re memorable at that). This show just has an upbeat look to it and the characters range from an old, short drunk to an dyslexic teenager. I don't know who writes this show but that person does a great job. If they had just continued the show I'm sure that it would get a positive response from the critics of this great country. If you are looking for a good, traditional comedy, then George Lopez is the show for you! The one bad thing is the title. George Lopez? Really? Imagine the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air being ""Will Smith"". C'mon man! But otherwise, this show is genius! 10/10",2010
9,"I have been watching this show since I was 14 and I've loved it ever since. I love this show because it's just plain funny! You will enjoy this show a lot because it shows something new and funnier everyday and my favorite part is when Benny always has her last comments on George after every punchline about his fat giant head.*laughs* I would laugh and I'd watch it with my friends at home it'd be like we were watching a funny movie but short. Love George Lopez. Funny, talented,funny,spectacular. This is a cool-funny-family comedy series enjoyable to everyone and you will definitely enjoy it--I did! And if you haven't watched it yet I suggest that you start watching because you wouldn't want to stop watching it. Even though there aren't anymore brand new episodes I still enjoy the re-runs. Still funny. Never wears off. ",2009
1,"This show was absolutely terrible. For one George isn't funny, and his kids are snobby little brats. He also treats his mother with no respect. As a Hispanic, I am highly offended by this show and the way the characters are portrayed.",2006
8,"While the first two Austin Powers films in this comedic series concentrated on spoofing the late '60s/early '70s, James Bond movies and concentrated on female anatomy in the process, this one was centered on penises. I kid you not. (Hence, the title, a play-on-words from ""Goldfinger."") ",2007
7,"After thoroughly enjoying the first two Austin Powers movies, they were daft but enormous fun, I watched this third instalment. I was disappointed admittedly, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. The plot takes the whole meaning of daftness to a whole level, so some of it verges on ridiculous, and while Mike Myers is brilliant as Austin and Dr Evil, he overdoes it as the Dutch villain Goldmember and the cameos are very hit and miss. That said, the sets and costumes are still wonderful, the soundtrack is groovy and the script is comedy gold with the cool catchphrases, bad-taste buffoonery and surreal slapstick. In terms of supporting performances Beyonce Knowles is a knockout as sexy and sassy Foxxy Cleopatra and Michael Caine is a dentally-challenged delight as Austin's dad. Seth Green is also fun as Scott Evil. Overall, an inferior sequel, but it was still a lot of fun, with Myers still having his mojo. 7/10 Bethany Cox",2010
10,"If I can describe this movie in three words, I would say, ""Shagadelic, baby, yeah!"" Mike Myers, the comedic genius who made the phrases, ""Yeah, baby"" and the word ""Shag"" famous is back again in a movie that is superior to the Spy Who Shagged Me.",2002
6,"To be brutal, this movie is cynical. I mean, Mike Myers is a funny guy, but this constant rehash of old material (see the radar jokes, the shadow-on-the-wall, the father-son misunderstandings) is just a bit worrying and suggests Mr. Myers has run out of ideas.",2002
7,"While this is still not as funny as the first one, it's still worth watching. It has a load of recycled jokes from both of the earlier films, and a little too many references to the first, in my opinion. It's not entirely bad though, after a slow start it kicks off and gets very funny, very quickly. Most of the old characters return, with a few new ones too. The plot is pretty much the same old deal from the first two, still spoofing old Bond movies. The acting is still pretty good. The characters are more colorful in this one, I think. More developed, perhaps. The sexual crude humor is still there, and is better here than in the second movie, I think. The first is still the best, but if you only see one of the sequels, I recommend you see this one. I thought the twist-in-the-end was pretty lame, but it didn't entirely ruin the movie, as it didn't seem totally out of character or totally unbelievable. I'd recommend this to anyone who liked either or both of the first two movies. The humor is mostly the same, and people who enjoyed the first two will most likely also enjoy this one. 7/10",2004
8,"Mike Myers returns for the third installment of his ""Austin Powers"" franchise.  In ""Goldmember,"" he comes full circle with the histories of Austin and Dr. Evil.  Myers again plays shagadelic secret agent Austin Powers, his arch-nemesis Dr. Evil and horrible henchman Fat Bastard, and now also a new bad guy, the Dutch hedonist Goldmember.  I found this movie hilarious and outrageous!  It had a lot of crude humor, like Austin hiding behind Mr. Roboto's fountain.  But there was also a good amount of self-parody.  The best scenes included Dr. Evil's prison rap video, and the suggestive subtitles in Mr. Roboto's office.  The several cameos were also enjoyable, especially Ozzy Osbourne pointing out the joke carried over from ""The Spy Who Shagged Me.""  The scene with Godzilla and its copyright was a relevant joke, considering the MPAA's temporary ban on the use of the title ""Goldmember.""  I did have a complaint about the continuity.  The difference in Austin Powers' trademark ""choppers"" was noticeable.  And although I'd have liked an explanation for the absence of Felicity Shagwell, I'm glad she was not revealed in the movie as a fembot!  Anyway, with this third installment, Austin Powers goes out with a bang!",2002

8,"I was a late comer to the whole Austin Powers craze. I passed on seeing the first two after seeing the trailers for them, I automatically figured they'd be dumber than dumb. I only saw this movie because 12 hour work shifts get really long and we have a t.v. here at work... so what are you gonna do?? ",2007

10,"This has got to be the funniest Austin Powers film, if not the best comedy there is. Now it may not suit everybody's taste but just so long as you don't watch it expecting a plot or story that flows, you will have one hell of a laugh! All the old gags are present and they STILL seem to work! Beyonce Knowles is extremely Foxy and the cameos from the likes of Steven Spielberg and Britney Spears are worth every penny. Honestly, watch this film if you love Austin Powers as there is plenty of energy left in the franchise and hopefully enough to keep it going many more years.",2002
1,"Goldmember is an outrageously average film, with poor jokes, poor writing and dreadful product placement. Lets face facts, the Austin Powers movies have been average, they ain't no laugh riot. The great thing about the Spy Who Shagged Me was of course, the introduction of Mini-Me. So what could be funnier, than to have this character be hit, fall over and generally be funny to look at. Beyonce Knowles suffers from a dreadful script in which she utters 'sugar' at every given opportunity to prove that she is from the '70s. Goldmember and Fat Bastard are dreadful characters, and the scenes with the 'mole' are extremely painful to watch. As for Dr. Evil and Powers, same old jokes apply of course. Just seems to me the Mike Myers has run out of ideas, and by adding a new character for him to play as the cameos do not hide that this a poor film. Austin Powers fans will love it i'm sure, but this is franchise too many. I'll be interested where Myers goes after this.",2002
1,"If you howled (as I did) at THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME, stick in the DVD and watch it again. The experience will be far better than seeing this ""new"" film made up of old gags. The theory seems to be that if several poopoo, teetee and fart jokes were funny, then ten times more of them will be ten times funnier. Uh-uh: it works in inverse proportion. The sole laugh-out-loud I had from this film was a piece of stock footage of a chimp falling out of a tree. The jokes telegraph themselves from miles away, the dialogue is horrible, and the plot...wait, what plot? On paper it would seem like a brainstorming session that no one bothered to write a first draft of. The shadow bit from SHAGGED ME is repeated, as is the bit with Dr. Evil's space ship/satellite/whatever being misidentified as giant body parts, and lots of other bits are rehashed as well. How in God's name is this getting the reviews it's been getting? Has our sense of humor sunk to such a dreadfully low level that we chortle at lists of euphemisms for male genitalia? To their credit, the audience I was with didn't laugh much either. Maybe you can't fool all of the people all of the time. I'd love to see word of mouth kill this puppy in the coming weeks. Ooo. Bad. So very very bad.",2002
1,"Some reviewers on the Internet have said that the opening scene of Goldmember is absolutely hilarious and likely the best part of the movie. From then on, they said, the film's jokes hit home less and less.",2002
1,"Goldmember isnt as good as the other 2 Austin Powers films. The jokes seem very strained, and apart from a few funny bits, especially a piece in the doctors office, the film never entertains as often as the others. The Goldmember character just doesnt work, Austin Powers himself seems to be struggling badly for any new gags leaving the still brilliant Dr Evil and Mini Me to offer the only funny parts. Although the plot was never the biggest part of these films, Mike Myers seems to have hit a complete dead end. Michael Caine isnt funny, Beyonce does her best in a part that allows little opportunity to be funny. The Fat Bastard character should have been left out, and the name dropping and product placement is way over the top. The opening scene contains a number of famous people such as Tom Cruise, Kevin Spacey and Britney Spears but the musical opening just doesnt work. I thought the film was poor. The jokes have ran dry. Mike Myers needs to move on because he is better than trying out old jokes again.",2002
1,"A horrible mix of bad acting, unfunny jokes, a plot that makes the Mario Bros. Movie look like Citizen Kane and some of the rudest and most pointless scenes ever. I saw this movie expecting something funny that would spoof the excellent Bond series but what I got was more how I imagine an adult film to be. You wouldn't know it was supposed to spoof James Bond as nothing Bond-like is present. The characters are boring and remarkable but not in a good way. The jokes are corny and are just vulgar. If you haven't already been cursed by its awfulness then skip this movie at all costs.",2011
2,"Back in 1997 Austin Powers came out and well it did good and the box-office and in 1999 the cheesy sequel appeared out of nowhere.Then there was this travesty of a film in 2002. The original had class,it was a fresh idea about a agent from the 60's frozen only to reapper in the 90's to fight his arch nemesis.Sure they jokes were'nt hilarious but they were original and being a spoof of James Bond,it contained subtle and unsubtle references to the series.Then ""The Spy who Shagged Me"" came out an it was okay.Now that Mike Myers played three characters there was a few more jokes and Mini-me.Slowly the jokes became more desperate fart jokes(Although though one or two were humorous)until eventually the ""Dr.Evil spaceship"" came along and then I finally gave up on the film. ""Goldmember"" was the worst of the bunch(What with Beyonce Knowles involved)and there was even more dumb jokes one after another(Okay I did laugh at the spoof joke with Gwenyth Paltrow,Tom Cruise,etc.because that was funny).Unfortunatley it was by the time that Britney Spears appear I knew things were going to get worse(Oh where to start!) Firstly there was the whole ""Daddy wasn't There crap"" and suddenly theres the Fook sisters.Next was the school for secret agents which just happens to have all the main characters from the last two films oh! and whats this another time machine,an annoying guy with peeling skin(plus poor speech and constantly declaring ""I'm dutch!!"" a la european stereotypes).The we had to see a horrible rendition of ""It's a hardknock life""(Ooh!!Isn't that Ben Savage and some cheap mole jokes),a disturbing scene in jail between Myers and Sterling(By the way the interragation scene with the subtitles,it was unnecessary for Beyonce to read them out loud),a unforgiving godzilla joke and a repeat of the ""spaceship"" joke mentioned earlier(Like we need The Osbournes cameo just to remind us that).Micheal Caine on the other hand plays his role very well as usual but dosn't save this excuse for a movie.Now with Seth Green as a possible villian and Demi Moore in talks I sleep more restless each night until this turkey(Please God!Just to teach them not to make more sequels)is out in the cinema.",2003

Mr. Myers, it's time to move on. So I Married An Axe Murderer was great.",2002

6,"It's the 20th Bond film and premiered on the 40th anniversary of the series, and, in many ways, it is really a tribute to the entire series itself. This film's strength and its weakness both lie in the fact that it is a blend of the classic Connery films, the outlandish Moore films, and the grittiness of the Dalton films. It's rolling the entire series into a single two hour adventure and the result is actually pretty entertaining. The first half is definitely stronger than the second; a more serious adventure with a classic feel to it, before taking a nose dive down into utter camp territory. I didn't mind the idea of making some scenes a little over-the-top, but I think they went overboard at times. Throughout the movie, the filmmakers toss in little references to previous Bond films. I suppose it's a fun idea to stop and consider how far these films have come over the last 40-something years, and a long time Bond fan can find amusement in finding these subtle, but long remembered treasures that poke their head in this film for one last time. As for the technical aspects of the film: The special effects are a little too ambitious and don't always come across convincing. The dialogue goes back and forth from excellent to atrocious. The ensemble of actors is pretty strong, except for Halle Berry, who in my opinion was completely wrong for a Bond movie. The villains are a little more dynamic. The action sequences are an improvement, in my mind. Granted, there are some instances where the filmmakers push the envelope a little too far, as mentioned above. However, they also show a certain amount of creativity that seemed to be lacking in the previous two films. Overall, this film is really a mixed bag. At moments there is potential for one of the greatest Bond adventures. At other moments you're thinking, ""What the heck am I watching."" Personally, I feel the positives balance out the negatives, but if anything, this film is a good popcorn movie. All in all, it wasn't a bad way to close out the series before rebooting it again with Casino Royale.",2007
6,"Creating new, exciting adventures for 007 after 20 feature films in forty years is a difficult task at best, particularly as public tastes change, and the character of James Bond has to maintain at least a degree of the 'persona' created by Ian Fleming.

Wilson, have done a remarkable job in keeping the series 'fresh', if DIE ANOTHER DAY is any indication, the creative forces surrounding them seem to be losing 'touch' with James Bond, and his world.",2004
1,"Come back George, all is forgiven:  At lease ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" was recognizable as a Bond film.  The latest installment in the franchise, the 20th installment in fact, should have been a cause for celebration.  Instead, I have to rate it a solid 1, and that only because the system won't let me rate it lower.  When did James Bond morph with Rambo?  What happened to the wit and charm that was evident in the best of the series, films like 'Goldfinger"" and ""The Spy Who Loved Me""?",2004
1,"Pis*-poor, Ill-conceived, soulless, mindless, horrifying - and thats just the title track in this 40th Anniversary defunctular - proof positive that the series is in terrible terrible trouble. In fact, based on the this exercise in self-parody (even the title sounds like a parody), devoid of any new or exciting elements, it might be worth pondering whether its time for the super-spy to take a sabbatical while all concerned contemplate a wholesale reinvention of the Francaise; a full-scale rebuilding from the ground up with absolutely no return to the cut and paste methodology that rots this one from the inside out. It isn't even worth discussing the story to this anniversary entry because there isn't one but it might be worth pointing out the contrast between this and the last anniversary story The Living Daylights (1987) for therein lies the clues to what's gone wrong with 007's exploits. Whereas Dalton's film used the anniversary as a sort of reaffirmation of principles and a throw back to the series dramatic and literary roots, a new dawn if you like (and frankly even if you don't), Die Another Dies goes the other way and represents the zenith of the Pervis/Wade era of Brosnan Bonds that has seen the action and budgets scale upward while the substance has conversely dipped and with the arrival of an invisible car, evaporated. This is about a trillion miles away from the 25th anniversary Bond in which familiar elements made the odd cameo appearance - the Astin Martin for example. Here the familiar is everything - in fact its the building blocks of the story (such as it is) and the characters and, well everything really. The tone is pure fantasy - deadly lasers in space, an evil ice palace lair for the villain, Madonna etc... Characters with silly names trade puns and insipid dialogue while Brosnan goes through the motions. If it was the intention of all concerned to make a companion piece for Austin Powers then they should consider DAD a roaring success. For those of us expecting a serious Bond movie however, its a minor travesty - Bonds have been lazy before (Moonraker, naturally) but this one completes the post-Goldeneye trajectory toward total self-parody and in doing so arguably takes its place along other genre greats such as Rocky 4, Star Trek: Nemesis and Batman and Robin in the 'film that crashed the series' category. Bond films have also been looking down the business end of oblivion before but 'tis no exaggeration to say that this time the martini loving super-spy is fighting for his life. Bond is a great character but unless the powers that be start to take him seriously again and refrain from this derivative fluff, they might as well call it a day.",2004
6,"DIE ANOTHER DAY is a unique Bond film for me because I had seen the other entries in the franchise before I discovered the IMDb . In other words my only knowledge of its reputation is down to the comments I have read on these pages and because many commentators are so loud in their condemnation ( Bad CGI , awful title track etc ) I was expecting a really bad movie never mind a really bad Bond movie , but DIE ANOTHER DAY wasn't as bad as I was expecting ",2004

5,Pierce Brosnan's last outing as James Bond takes place in Die Another Day which finds 007 trying to stop a rogue North Korean general from starting the Korean War all over again with the attending consequences.

7,"There is one of the widest cluster of spectators ever possible for a franchised movie. There is its own fans. For almost half a century from the old generations to the youth it is always advised that the 007-Bond movies are the best action & thriller of all. Yet to watch Die Another Day there are so many other reasons! Relying on the protection of its confidence and splendour, Die Another Day sight sees some of the larger-than-life and glamorous centres of the earth. In ""You Only Live Twice"" and ""The Man with the Golden Gun"" Bond has visited Hong-Kong several times; and he does once more in Die Another Day. We are going to see Cuba for the second time after ""Golden Eye"", and again for the second time we will be in Bond's top-secret MI6 office in London,U.K after ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"". We also have a chance to see unforgettably spectacular views from Hawaii's virgin hills and from Iceland. In fact, wherever it says it's North Korea, it's location is still Hawaii. Some of the North Korean scenes like the elaborate hovercraft chase scene were shot in U.K. as well.",2009

5,"This movie starts out with Ian Fleming rolling on his grave for the millionth time since he passed away. When I saw the trailer, it looked like just another one of Brosnan's not-so-hot outings as James Bond (which was a more refined Remington Steele), lots of explosions, an Aston Martin with an invisibility feature and a deadly weapon called Icarus.

1,"An outing which represents a first for the Bond franchise i.e. one that fails abjectly in virtually every discernible area. The most prominent one being that of a cut'n'paste, dog's dinner of a screenplay that looks as though it was cobbled together by the screenwriters during their dinner break. Previous entries such as 'OHMSS' and 'From Russia With Love' managed to treat their audiences with more than a modicum of intelligence. This is in stark contrast to D.A.D. which seemed to be aiming for an audience predominately populated by XXX-loving, popcorn-munching, baseball capped cretins who will demand the right to see as many things blown up as possible with at least as many people being either shot or wasted whilst being assured that such minor trivialities as 'plot' or 'characterization' are not allowed to spoil their enjoyment of proceedings.",2006

Well as soon as this turkey Die Another Day was released that discussion became forever and permanently DEAD. Die Another Day contains some of the most IDIOTIC one-liners of all time, DREADFULL CGI, HORRIBLY unfunny jokes, pathetically LAME sexual innuendos, a Bond girl (Halle Berry) that is probably the WORST Bond girl of all time, a main villain (Toby Stephens) that is like Robocop meets a snootish/spoiled British brat, a main henchman (Rick Yune) that is like something out of a Star Wars movie for crying out loud, and last but certainly not least, Brosnan stinks it up as well.",2003
1,"This is without doubt the one of the very worst James Bond movies. In fact this is a b- movie, plain and simple. The Storyline is crap, the acting is crap and the special effects are especially crap (the die cast car models cast thrown out of the ""airplane"" at the end). Brosnans acting is as wooden as ever, and the story is just laughable. Let's face it, there is noting left that distinguishes a James Bond movie form any other action movie.

There have been a bare handful of spy films that feature relatively realistic spy thrillers, especially recently with a concentration on spectacular movies that have less substance than cotton candy.",2003
9,"James Bond and Ethan Hunt take notice. ""The Bourne Identity"" is my new standard for contemporary spy thrillers.  Gone (or almost gone) are the special effects that James and Ethan rely on all too heavily. Hell, in those franchises the special effects have virtually replaced story and characters. ""The Bourne Identity"" has a very straightforward story to tell, a mystery that slowly unravels. Spycraft is not all about technical gizmos, but requires human brains and human brawn (and a fair amount of gunplay and car chases). ",2002

10,"This is a great movie. Unfortunately one reviewer has no knowledge towards the field of psychology. One reviewer states it's a good movie based on a completely false occurrence, that being amnesia in general. They say it doesn't exist and nobody loses their memory of their identity while retaining knowledge of everything else. This is untrue. I am currently studying to become a psychologist, it's called Dissociative Amnesia. -Dissociative Amnesia - formerly Psychogenic Amnesia, is a pervasive loss of memory of significant personal information. This disorder is characterized by a blocking out of critical personal information. Dissociative amnesia, unlike other types of amnesia, does not result from other medical trauma, such as a blow to the head. The predominant disturbance is one or more episodes of inability to recall important personal information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature, that is too extensive to be explained by ordinary forgetfulness - Just to prove, it's true, and does happen. So this movie is not based on something made up, similar losses of memory do happen to people. Especially people in a job such as that. So, concluding, this is a great action film, I truly enjoyed this movie along with the sequel, The Bourne Supremacy. Both are I think going to be a couple of the best movies we will see this decade (2000-2010)",2004
8,"While the action genre is as believable and formulaic as an NSync song, The Bourne Identity takes a much needed step to the side to watch oncoming traffic. Subtle, yet still holding true to multiple action formulas (lots of fighting, cool weaponry, and chase scenes), this film presents a new era of action film making which could be all the wave. Matt Damon, who has the unfortunate nature of watching his less talented friend Ben Affleck gain notoriety for trash movies, is an excellent choice as the CIA operative turned amnesiac Jason Bourne. ",2002
9,"The crew of a fishing vessel find a body floating in the middle of the ocean. They bring it on board and the improvised 'doctor' finds two bullets on the back and a Swiss bank account implanted in the hip of the body. The 'body' indeed is not dead but unconscious: he is Jason Bourne (Matt Dammon), a CIA secret and very well prepared agent with amnesia. During the period of fishing in the sea, he recovers his health. Once on shore, he decides to go to the Swiss bank and then to the American Consulate. There he meets Marie Helena Kreutz (Franka Potente, from 'Run Lola Run' and 'Anatomy') and they two together will pass to the most spectacular actions along the film. The great Matt Dammon and Franka Potente are perfect. This movie is everything that 'Tripple X' and 'Die Another Day' intended to be and did not offer to the viewer: a non-stop and excellent action film. Fortunately this screenplay was not in the hands of Tom Cruise, otherwise he would like to perform the role of Jason Bourne and spoil this film, as usual. It is amazing the filmography of Matt Dammon. This great actor knows how to select good screenplays. I am not familiarized with the filmography of Franka Potente ( I believe most of them has not been released on VHS or DVD in Brazil), but in 'Run Lola Run' and 'Anatomy' I liked her performance very much. One thing that called my attention along this movie was her perfect accent in English (with the exception of the 'sh....' expressions in German). The great Chris Cooper and Julia Stiles perform secondary roles along this outstanding action movie. My vote is nine.",2003
8,"I can sympathize with reviewers who had read the book and were disappointed by this film and the liberties it apparently took with the story. I've had that happen with books I've enjoyed and it can spoil a film you might otherwise have liked. I never read the book, so I was able to appreciate this film on its own merits - slick, tough, fast-paced and refreshingly devoid of the kind of nonsense that has made the Bond films harder and harder to sit through.

8,"Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne, a highly trained, U.S. spy whose wounded body is found floating in an ocean by a fishing boat. With no memory of who he is and what happened to him, he has to piece together how he came to be shot in the back and left for dead; and most importantly, who and what he is. But Damon must do it fast, as time is running out and the ones he worked for are sending assassins to find him. ""The Bourne Identity"" is top-notch spy movie, filled with action, suspense, and a mystery that is slowly explained as the movie goes on. Matt Damon is well suited for the role, and with the help of fancy editing, he comes off as a martial arts expert who can quickly dispatch multiple foes in a few seconds. The movie moves along very fast, making the near two hour running time feel like it's thirty minutes shorter than it is. Fast pacing and a likable hero (Damon) are two big strengths of this movie that fans of spy/thriller/suspense movies should not miss. My most memorable, movie moment of ""The Bourne Identity"" is the scene when Damon evades the police with an original Mini car! Hey, it's not the car, it's the driver that counts.",2016
10,"Always seen the books but never read them - now I will. This is a great cloak and dagger spy story that really works in this format. Matt Damon is not the perfect Jason Bourne, as he just seems a bit 'young' to forfill the role of bond like super-spy. However is acting skills are classy enough that he carries it off well. The story is very fluid and the action is well-paced. Easy to follow and yet never boring, it really shows how a great story is the best place to start with a movie. Done in a very tasteful manner that makes it believable and engaging. I consider myself a 'fussy' movie viewer, but this really was entertaining, even the second and third times!",2004

It's got everything you're after: intelligent story, believable and likable characters, and yes, action too, but it's realistic action, not some Matrix-style kicking.",2005
10,"When I first heard what this film was about from a friend of mine who had just seen it I liked the sound of it . When he told me that Matt Damon was playing the lead part as a covert/clandestine CIA operative with amnesia + martial arts skills etc I must admit , I just couldn't picture it ( I guess because I hadn't seen him in that type of role before ) . But when I watched this film , all my doubts were banished. I already thought of Matt Damon as a good actor before this film , but his performance in this ( and all of the Bourne films ) elevates him , to one of the truly great actors. It's the fact that he is so convincing in the role and that you can really sympathise with the character. As it turns out , casting Matt Damon for this role is pure genius. I simply can't imagine anyone else in the role. One of the many aspects of his performance which impressed me was the attention to detail, for example the effort he put into the pronunciation of the different languages he speaks in the film which without a doubt contributed to the character being more believable.",2008
9,"It's hard to believe that back in 2002, The Bourne Identity would rewrite the rule book for action/spy movies and set a new benchmark. There's plenty of thrilling action sequences, and there's also the addition of brains to counterbalance the brawn. Matt Damon, who was an unlikely choice as the spy Jason Bourne, completely redefined the movie spy for the millennium and made himself and his character a household name. Based on the best selling novel of the same name by Robert Ludlum, The Bourne Identity was one of the most successful movies of 2002 which spawned several successful sequels.",2016

Much better than that stupid movie Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit. The action in this movie is unbelievable. If you don't watch this movie, you are missing out on a lot. Definitely a bang for the buck. And spoiler's alert, you do see a lot of Julia Stiles' ass for a good portion of the movie so that is also a plus. And Matt Daemon if you swing the other way. Other than that, you got to see it!

Matt Damon as Jason Bourne is what some describe as just a modern day James Bond. But with a powerful portrayal by Damon, he feels more like an original character, a spy agent with a highly trained set of fighting skills in both gun and hand-to- hand combat. In this spy action thrilled directed by Doug Liman, Matt Damon steps into what is arguably his most charismatic role aside from his Oscar-nominated performance in 'Good Will Hunting'. Damon plays the title character Jason Bourne, a CIA agent who wakes up on a boy after being rescued by a group of fisherman. Suffering from amnesia and covered in bullet wounds, he travels to Switzerland where he uses his old bank account to put together the puzzle pieces of his identity. He is soon assisted by German woman Marie (played by Franka Potente) to search for his identity but soon find himself by hunted down by ruthless assassins by Black Ops agent Alexander Conklin (played by Chris Cooper).

8,"Other than the explanation of where he came from, who he and everyone else is, at the beginning, this film stands nicely on its own. for those of you that know the first one, then this opening explanation will be a little irritating (and a tad confusing, but it becomes clear later). The opening does smell strongly of franchise potential, being repeated in all the inevitable sequels still to come. Once past this though, we are lead through a massive fight and action scene that sets up the whole movie. and warns anyone who can't stand Hong Kong action scenes that they are probably watching the wrong screen.",2002
10,"Wesley Snipes, Kris Kristofferson and Luke Goss star in this film where the day walker Blade(Wesley Snipes)has to help his enemies fight their enemies the dangerous fully made vampires that were made by lab.

10,"What a bloodfeast! Solid action through and through, from first minutes to the last. The Daywalker (Wesley Snipes) is even more invincible than in the first movie, a very good performance from Snipes. Kris Kristofferson is also doing a good job. Whistler may look like a Santa Clause, but when he opens his mouth he is a seen-it-all veteran who knows exactly what to do. Seldom have I walked out of the theater and straight back in line, wanting for more, but with this movie I made an exception.",2002
10,"I went to go see Blade 2, hoping that it was going to be better than the first.  I was truly amazed at the fine choreographing of fighting scenes. They are the best fighting scenes I have ever seen, fast, accurate, and able to make you feel the pain that it causes.  Wesley Snipes is an excellent martial artist and this movie really gives him a chance to prove it.  If there were to be a Blade 3, I would definitely go watch it.",2002
10,"This was one action-packed thrill ride.  Though I would say I liked it about the same as the first one even though it had more action, the first one had a better plot.  Though I understood everything and did not find any of the plot twists to confusing or anything like a lot of others complain about. The darker setting is very cool and the European setting makes this movie have a Gothic setting.  It is a combination of the very old and new that gives this film great atmosphere.  The plot is there is a new breed of vampire on the streets and normal vampires need Blade's help in disposing of them, but can he really trust them.  I highly recommend this flick.",2002
10,"If you look to the side, you will see that the vampire's lair is called the Caliban Institute. Caliban as in the freak trying to kill his master in Shakespeare's the tempest, and Caliban as in anagram for Canibal--cannibal, or vampire eating vampire. Blade is the little boy's fantasy come true, and it scratched the itch I got from watching pretentious-PG-13-for-little-Goths-wannabes-posing-as-dark-movie-Queen-of-th e-Damned by mutilating the bodies of Satanicly twist-minded vampires, and turning them into BME poster children. In the end, as Satanic as Anne Rice wants them to be, her vampires are no more menacing than a pair of white fags--I mean fangs. As menacing as these pansies pretend to be, they would probably faint at the sight Robbie Williams' ""Rock DJ"", which is the stuff you see in the clubs Blade hangs out at. It also turned away from the wow,-mom-I-know-kung-fu-too,-look-at-me! action genre in moments of sheerly brilliant comic relief. Bor lei jun and Seunlau ngaklau both showed that jump kicks are the stupidest moves to throw against wrestlers, and Blade knows it and takes it to the next level by bringing the prowrestling in the kung-fu. Finally, the tragedy of the vampires is played much more dramatically here than in either of Anne Rice's movies, and the end is a pure beauty.",2002
10,"God, I loved this film! Forget realism, just sit back and enjoy the pace. It's exhilarating and fast action.  It's violent (very violent in fact)but the pace means you are on to the next bit of action before it all registers. Wesley Snipes is 'perfection' and whilst it was not as character driven as the first, it was fun throughout.  The fight sequences were well choreographed and it was a breathtaking display of skills and martial arts. The 'traitor' was totally unexpected and added an edge to the film.  I can't wait for 'Blade 3'!  Bring on the vampires. P.S. Luke Goss doesn't sing!",2002
10,This sequal is typical that it is not as good as the first but it still rocks.  I enjoyed the action scenes.  The music was nice and a added compliment.  When you attend this movie remember that MATRIX should not be your expectation to judge.  Many people have asked me how it compares. The action is different but based off the same idea.  Can not wait for Blade 3,2002
10,"This is an awesome sequel to one of the best action movies ever.  Wesley Snipes has a great performance in this film, as the kick butt vampire/human blade and does an excellent job with the character.  Put simply it rocks!",2002
6,I believe the original Blade is a highly underrated comic book film that is great but this film is okay and fails to live up to the level of the original. This film sees Blade ally with a group of Vampires to go against a new vampire hunting race that could affect vampires and humans alike. Wesley Snipes is fantastic as Blade and I really believe that he was the perfect casting for the mix of charisma and sturdiness for the character. The supporting cast is a bit of a mixed bag I don't understand why Whistler was in this film but I thought he was good in the film. I thought the person who was looking like he was having the most fun was Ron Perlman who was great in his villainous role with his chemistry with Blade being really good. Blade's love interest is poor and a waste of time for the story and the main villain is not memorable at all. The story is poor compared to the first one with the romance being lazy and most of the team are not developed at all and the unnecessary bringing back of Whistler. The script is okay with Snipes and Perlman having the best lines and delivering well but nobody else had any decent lines at all. The style was great with the Gothic take of vampire lifestyle mixing with real life that makes this character so unique. Blade 2 is okay but it isn't as good as the original and I won't be rushing to see it again.,2014

10,"Ok, I didn't think it was as good as the first one, though there was an obvious improvement in the special effects - but this movie really rocked. My wife who didn't particularly like the first one absolutely loved this one.  The action scenes were amazing, and though it looked like Blade was gonna get all sappy towards the vampires - (especially the girl), he still kicked ass.  And it had an awesome ending - comparable to the ending in Russia in the first movie.",2002

1,"I saw this film at a packed opening weekend showing in NYC. As the film progressed and the tension rose I thought to myself that this was actually a pretty good film. There were scares, some laughs and even some scenes that tugged at the old heart strings. It reminded me of Night of the Living Dead and the original War of the Worlds, both of which are long time favorites. Durring the final, climactic scene something so completely retarded occurred that I was ripped out of the contented haze the movie had lulled me into. I was shocked. I turned to my girlfriend and said ""They get killed by water? Water kills them?"" She said, loudly ""This movie is F*CKING DUMB!"" And I said ""I don't believe it..."" And that's it. Naked aliens who find water to be deadly come to the wettest place in this solar system. Then, believe it or not, they get killed with water. Other posters (nearly 1,000 or something) have pointed out how utterly insulting this is so I won't go any further into it. I would like to know why the people who rate this a 10 don't bother addressing this outlandish plot device that destroys the entire film for so many others. I would even accept an explanation like ""I am an idiot and MAJOR plot-holes don't bother me at all"". Has M. Night ever defended this ludicrous flick? No? That's probably because it's indefensible.",2006

Everyone is going into this movie thinking it is some kind of chilling horror, or blood-and-gore slasher flick. Shyamalan doesn't do those tired genres, thankfully. Instead, he gives us a warm, funny, emotionally-charged, and yes, suspenseful thriller which manages to compact an entire list of genres into one whole film.",2002

Admittedly, it has quite a few moments that really scare the hell out of you (at least on the big screen). But the ending? Think about it! Aliens invade the earth and have to leave because they can't cope with water/rain? Where does that come from??? They've obviously been to earth a few times to ""check the location"", but they never encountered rain? They don't know that???

What I also can't get over is how much we have declined as a nation and as a culture to the point where ridiculous ""shows"" like this continue to be successful. Give me a break! The bachelor and all of the ""contestants"" are all morally repugnant and reprehensible in their actions. The bachelor basically ""test drives"" 25 different women during the course of the show, and each one of the them tries their best to get this guy to marry them. The women pull out all the stops in order to try to get this accomplished, regardless of how they really feel about him. It is so stupid that it is beyond belief, and you can totally tell they they are only after the guy for his money and security. Why would any woman with an ounce of decency spend even a second of her time with a man who is sleeping with 24 other women at basically the same time? The women all come across as so shallow and dense, and you would have to think that any woman who comes on this show as a contestant is probably someone with issues and who would therefore not be a good catch. If they are such viable candidates, why hasn't someone found them yet? It all just shows how materialistic and depraved our culture has become, and how true love takes a backseat to all of the superficial stuff that everyone is so preoccupied with. Please take this trash off the air!!!!",2009

I believe there is a station for shows like this, FOX news, but ABC, actually the network should be boycotted. I believe I watched the first or second bachelor and then became bored to tears when it was the same crap over and over. Why not watch Days of Our Lives? At least you know its a crock of crap. Anyway, this show is clearly RACIST! But the sad thing is, ABC would put a minority on and still surround he/she with all white men/women and stereotypical minorities.

I don't get the hype about a guy living in a house of hot girls who he gets to take his pick of and jump back and forth between whenever, not to mention lead all of them on and probably screws them simultaneously.

As usual, I was practicing my theory of ""lowered expectations.""  I expect a movie to be horribly awful ahead of time, so I can not be disappointed.  I was not disappointed. At the end of the film I could not sit still in my seat.  I felt the urge to go out into the world and proclaim the utter awesomeness of ""Equilibrium.""  Such words as ""Sweet,"" ""Crazy,"" and ""Righteous"" sprang forth from my lips in rapid succession when I talked about the movie with my friends. Not since the ""Fellowship of the Ring"" have I desired to sing a movie's praises.  And I mean literally SING.  ""Equilibrium"" could, and should, be the sleeper hit of the year.  The film's action sequences stir up the blood and pump the adrenaline as if you were riding a roller-coaster.  The art style, while minimalistic, and thus maybe confused for low-budget by some, is actually quite successful in portraying a totalitarian and emotionless society.  The acting is excellent as well, and quite possibly the best I have seen in an action film in long time. While the nay-sayers will say that the film is too unoriginal, borrowing elements of its story and premise from ""Fahrenheit 451"" and ""Brave New World,"" these complaints can be disregarded as the movie adds enough of its own style and story to make the comparisons plausible in basic premise only. In the end, like any movie, ""Equilibrium"" is meant as entertainment. And entertain it does. It does it so very well.  It mixes action and with substantial plot and original style to make an excellent whole.  Go see it. Go see it twice.  Go see ""Equilibrium,"" Cleric.",2002

First, I rarely will watch a movie twice unless enough time has passed that I have forgotten how it ends. There are just too many movies out there and not enough time. But this movie deserved the time. I loved the fight scenes, loved the premise of the movie, loved the acting (and seeing Christian Bale shirtless). Emily Watson is an amazing actress. It's rare these days to see an action/SciFi with actual plot and dialog. How can I care about a movie if I don't care about the characters? Anyway, watch it.

The film is really great, quick action, combined with a brilliantly stated philosophical question, breathtaking scenes with lots of effects, superb actors! It perfectly balances on the verge between just a high-budget nonsense action film (despite it's low budget) and extremely boring science-fiction film. It was quite a nice surprise when I watched it, because the director is not famous! And there was not any Hollywood superstar but all and the acting is amazingly great! Like the actors completely fit in their roles and ruthlessly overwhelm the weak script parts! I still remember the change of the emphasis when the main character changed sides! With this performance it is a serious competitor of ""the matrix"" or maybe more! ",2005

Christian Bale does an excellent job playing Grammaton Cleric John Preston. The action scenes in this movie surpass those of the once hailed Matrix (1999).

It's a little slow to get going, but pretty soon after wards i really got into the story,and while i didn't get all that was going at certain points i was still fascinated all the same!, plus Taye Diggs was great as the villain, as was the other one!. The ending has a shocking twist, and it has some spectacular gun battles and fight scenes!, plus i wish Sean Bean didn't have to get killed of so soon. The character development is awesome!, and i thought the plot while complicated was really excellent!, plus some scenes gave me the chills.There were some really shocking scenes, and the film had a disturbing feel to it, plus i found it quite creative!. This is a fascinating Action/Sci-Fi film, that's very engrossing and always surprising, with an amazing performance from Christian Bale!, and i say it's a must see for everyone!. The Direction is excellent!.Kurt Wimmer does an excellent job here, with stunning camera work,fantastic angles, wonderful slow mo shots, and lots of other great creative shots as well!. The Acting is wonderful!. Christian Bale is AMAZING as always, and is amazing here, he is incredibly tense, extremely likable, always unpredictable, had a very mysterious character, carried the film,had a lot of character, and you can't take your eyes off him when he's on screen, and amazing performance indeed! (Bale Rules!!). Taye Diggs is great here as one of the villains, and while i wanted to slap that smile off his face at times, he was quite effective, for the most part, i just wished he had more screen time. Emily Watson is great here, and can do these roles in her sleep!,i liked her lots. Sean Bean sadly only has a cameo, but it's a damn cool one at that! (Bean Rules!). Rest of the cast do fine. Overall a must see for everyone!. ****1/2 out of 5",2005
1,"I want to add to my previous comment that vote-rigging is the likely cause of Equilibrium's high IMDB score. Typically, IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes scores are highly correlated, but in this case they are diametrically opposed. Rotten Tomatoes gives Equilibrium a 26% rating, making it one of the worst movies of 2002. Meanwhile, IMDB has this turkey at 7.8 out of 10, one of the highest rated movies of the year. While critics and audience members sometimes disagree, they never disagree by this much. There is clearly an error with one of the two scores. Since the Rotten Tomatoes voting is easily verifiable by counting up the positive and negative critics comments posted on the site, I believe the problem lies with the IMDB score. If this is just the result of adolescent boys running up the score to give the movie a boost, then it is not such a big deal. But if it is a commercial ploy to boost Equilibrium DVD sales and rentals then that would be something far more serious.",2003
5,"For some odd reason IMDb is the only place were this movie is being praised. In most countries this movie didn't even got a theatrical release or was only shown in a very limited amount of theaters and only for a short period. There is a very good reason for this for ""Equilibrium"" simply is not a good movie. It really is nothing more than an average B-science-fiction movie and on top of that it's terrible unoriginal. Especially when you've seen movies like ""Fahrenheit 451"", ""THX 1138"", ""1984"", ""Metropolis"", ""Blade Runner""...must I really go on? Basically there is no movie in the science-fiction genre were this movie didn't 'borrowed' heavily from.",2005
8,When I sat down to watch this I expected to see a sci-fi action thriller; while it does feature plenty of action and there are science fiction elements one shouldn't expect lots of cool futuristic vehicles at weapons. Equilibrium is set in the near future after a third world war; in order to prevent future war a drug has been developed to suppress all human emotion. This has not led to a Utopia however; this future is very much a dystopia; anybody who is suspected of committing 'sense crimes' is executed without trial; this summary justice is carried out by 'clerics' such a John Preston; a man so devoid of emotion that he executed his own partner and barely batted an eyelid when his wife was taken to be incinerated. That is until one day he fails to take the emotion-suppressing drug. As time passes his feelings get deeper and he realises that he must fight against the system; a fight that could mean sacrificing innocent people to get close to Father; the leader of this emotionless world.,2011
7,"Yes, I can truly say that i enjoyed this movie. The film was almost totally centred around the characterisation of Bale's ""clerk"" figure. His performance was as ever slick, and for most the the performance - genuine. His character was well portrayed and really captured the transition from his initial robotic persona, to his latter more emotionally free state of mind. This was illustrated both in his professional life and his social interactions and really showed how his entire existence was shaped totally by the numbing of emotion. Some great ideas and proficient acting, not to mention lots of traditional ""destroying the place"" action mixed in, really gives this movie the edge over many other similar titles within the broad action genre.",2008
1,"OK so I love Fahrenheit 451, 1984 and brave new world but this movie was absolute rubbish. I can live with the concept, story line, shots and direction. However the movie comes out overly flat and the concept of taking down people with those stupid moves is ridiculous. Why would a squad surround someone to shoot them??? They would end up wiping themselves out in the cross-fire. Dumb, dumb, dumb!!!!!!!!!! Could have been great but the few flaws I found absolutely appalled me. I don't recommend it too anyone but I can't see how any Orwell or Huxley lovers could miss this. So watch it but be prepared to break the disc in disgust.",2006
9,"A 9 out of 10 only for some budget deficiencies that show a bit. By all means skip the director commentary because its all whining about lack of funds. Understandable, but obnoxious to sit through. ",2005
10,"""Equilibrium"" is one of the most passionate and emotional movies I've ever seen, and this comes from a movie that depicts a society that exists based on the concept that emotion and passion are the very things that led to the destruction of humanity, which is why feelings have been banned in the movie.",2006
7,"I have wanted to see Equilibrium for some time now but have always been put off by so many negative comments. It arrived from my DVD rental site last week and so I finally got around to it, and was really rather surprised at how good it was. Yes, it isn't perfect, what film is, and yes it borrowed ideas from other sources, but name me one that hasn't? But I don't think it's the utter tripe some have been saying. There were great performances all around, but most especially from Christian Bale who totally convinces as an unfeeling, soulless assassin who works for a totalitarian government intent on suppressing peoples emotions in order to prevent another catastrophic war, who then at first accidentally does not take his emotion suppressing drug, then deliberately doesn't. Your eyes are riveted to him as it slowly dawns on him just what sort of world he is living in. The fight scenes are highly stylised, but unlike The Matrix, actually have a point and purpose to them, instead of just being for show; one grumble I do have is how the soldiers just seemed to line up to be shot – I wouldn't fancy them defending me, thanks! I hesitate to bring up The Matrix as I feel this film suffers unfairly in comparison; it would have done so much better if it had been released first, as, and I know I am likely to be shot down in flames for this, I prefer it to The Matrix, which I think is an overblown, self important, very good looking piece of tosh, which is so far up its own backside, it could play tonsil hockey with itself!",2009
7,"The movie deals with the biography of Frida Kalho (well performed by Salma Hayek , though Laura San Giacomo was originally set to play her but was dropped when fans objected to a non-Mexican playing the role) who after a terrible accident with a trolley causes herself a crippling injury , then she gets away from her parents (Roger Rees and Patricia Spinola) to live on the paintings . She falls in love with famed muralist Diego Rivera (Alfred Molina , he gained 50 lbs , 23 kg , for this character) who bears a separated marriage (to Valeria Golino) . Later on , Frida is wedded to Diego and the troubles come out .",2005
10,"Usually, when you see a biopic about a famous artist and genius you either get to see a tragic, suffering creature or an idealized God. And often it's always the same: He/she was born, had a difficult childhood, created some masterpieces, had some affairs (usually with actors/actresses or/and musicians) and dies a sad and lonely death. But what a refreshing difference ""Frida"" was! Frida Kahlo's life was more suffering than joy, yet the movie does not pity her all the time but shows Frida's lust for life, love, art and her husband Diegor Riviera.",2005
8,"'Frida' is a rich and passionate account of two celebrated Mexican artists, whose lives were bound up with major events of the 20th century-the Mexican and Russian Revolutions... The film takes us at the center of the art world in one of the most tumultuous alliance between two painters, an alliance filled with joy and heartbreak, love and betrayal...",2003
8,"""Frida"" is a beautifully done biopic about Mexican artist and icon Frida Kahlo.  Salma Hayek plays this role very well.  She exhibits all the passion that goes into being an artist, especially when playing off Alfred Molina, who plays Diego Rivera, husband of Frida Kahlo, and a famous Mexican artist in his own right.  What really impressed me was the artistic references in the movie.  I loved seeing the paintings coming to life!  I also liked the surreal animated sequences, particularly the hospital nightmare, populated with Day of the Dead-style skeletons.  Few movies have ever made me regard them as a work of art.  ""Frida"" is definitely one of them!",2002
9,"This is a very well-realized film, and the most inspired thing about it is the casting of Salma Hayek in the title role.",2002
7,"""Frida"" is saved from mediocrity by the wonderful performances of Selma Hayek and Alfred Molina, and by its imaginative cinematography. Unfortunately, the underlying story of the love affair between the title character, Frida Kahlo, and her husband, Diego Rivera, tells an unpleasant tale of irresponsibility and betrayal.  Nevertheless, Kahlo's art is cleverly used to tell her story and Hayek's and Molina's terrific performances manage to invest Kahlo and Rivera with an attractiveness I suspect they lacked in real life.  This is a good although not a great film; recommended, 7 out of 10.",2004
2,"Having studied the history of art academically for five years at college and university, I was aware of Kahlo only vaguely, as a shadowy player on the fringes of the Surrealist movement. I was familiar with a few of her self-portraits and knew about the appalling accident that had such an impact on her life. My first criticism of this movie is that it adds very little to this outline. ",2007
6,"I generally find biopics fairly boring, and ""Frida"" is no exception. Their makers always seem to think that an examination of the person will illuminate the art they produced, and they almost never do. Maybe because art comes from such a deep, personal place in each individual that a filmmaker can't get at the source.",2010
8,"I watched this film for the first time, last night,and, it is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. There are shades of ""Surviving Picasso"" about it. Yet, this movie transcends the Picasso film on a number of levels. Where ""Surviving Picasso"" is all about Anthony Hopkins masterful performance, ""Frida"" has a chemistry between its leading actors that you just don't see enough of in modern cinema. Yes, Salma Hayek inhabits the character of Frida and makes it entirely her own. But Alfred Molina's portrayal of her overweight, philandering husband really brings this movie to life. History is important to this movie also. Although removed from the turbulent events dominating European politics in the 1930s, Mexico embraces the ideology that will soon tear Europe apart and reflects that ideology in its art. Diego Rivera, as portrayed by Molina, is certainly a greater lover of women and painting than he is of political ideology, but the fact that he plays host to the exiled Trotsky shows that he is willing to put himself in harms way for the sake of his political principles. Trotsky is played charmingly by Geoffery Rush and his introduction to the story sends Diego and Frida's marriage to another level. This movie never fails to surprise you and if you have not seen it yet, you should.",2007
5,"Now I know that Frida Kahlo had an accident, was involved with Diego Rivera and Trotski, and had strange eyebrows. I also know that Selma Hayak is a babe, and I know a lot about her breasts. Among the things I don't know: what Kahlo's relation to women was; how she learned to paint; what painters she admired; what her relation to the 'revolution' was; what the relation was between suffering and art. I am left to imagine how this absolutely perfect body on which the camera dotes so obsessively could possibly contain the pain it is supposed to harbor (every forty minutes or so the director reminds us of this). But then, I get a really cool lesbian-dancing scene, which I suppose was more important than any of this trivial stuff. And did I mention the boobs?",2009
2,"This film could pass as a made-for-network-TV biopic of Frida Kahlo. Underneath all the pretty imagery, there's very little there.  It looks nice - the film displays some well done imagery, just like Julie Tamor's other film, ""Titus"".  Unfortunately, the imagery doesn't support any meaningful expression.  The characters in this story are paper thin.  The film provides no insight into their politics, relationships, or why they ""must"" paint.",2003
5,"Salma Khalo's movie grabs many references from the other movie about, Frida: Naturaleza Viva (1984, not 1986), but not the important thing about her shows in the movie, in fact, deliberately (i don't know who had this brilliant idea) twist all the controversial faces of Frida and the contribution to Socialist movement, the support to Sandinist Armed uprising in Nicaragua , instead Salmas wants count us a tale with aspartame; to American market a friendly face of the real anti-capitalist Frida Khalo.",2011

8,"Frida Kahlo (Salma Hayek) is an tempestuous teenager, when  she suffers a bus accident in Mexico. Her column and leg have multiples fractures and she is impaled by a metal bar. Her father and mother spend all the money they have in surgeries and treatments, and in the end, also due to her will and strength, she walks again. Frida shows her paintings to the famous painter, intellectual and communist Diego Rivera (Alfred Molina) to criticize them. He finds them excellent and they become friend, lovers and get married to each other. Diego is very unfaithful to her and has many night stands with his models, but when he has an affair with Frida's sister Cristina, their marriage ends and they divorce. In the 30's, Leon Trotsky (Geoffrey Rush) gets political asylum in Mexico and is lodged with his wife in the house of Frida's parents. Frida and Trotsky have an affair, when Trotsky's wife ask him to move to another place. Rivera moves to USA and Frida has a gangrene in her toes. They are amputated and Frida gets worse and worse, using pain killers, steel jackets and other treatment. But she starts painting maybe her best pictures. Rivera comes back to Frida and gets married with her for the second time, and stays with her until her death. The story of this Mexican artist is wonderfully presented in this movie, with a stunning performance of Salma Hayek. Frida is showed as a great artist, revolutionary human being, having a great sexuality, feeling pain due to her accident, but having a great pleasure in life. All the cast and the direction are excellent. The theme song (`Burn It Blue'), from the Brazilian Caetano Veloso, is wonderful and won the Oscar. The make-up also won an Oscar. An excellent entertainment indicated for any audience. My vote is eight.",2004
6,"Frida's life was a soap opera, and seemingly tailor-made for a film, but the tiny budget and mediocre performances don't do justice for such a brilliant artist. The lethargic pacing and frustrating sense of unexplored avenues gives the viewer the sense of an unfinished film. Salma Hayek is suitable in the main role, but she lacks the finesse and stage presence to portray such an iconic figure. Alfred Molina, normally a brilliant, chameleonic actor who vanishes into whatever role he plays, seems strangely inert. Even Geoffrey Rush as Trotsky isn't that great.",2015
2,"IF Frida is any indication of what you can expect from Hollywood in 2003 save your Money. Frida Kahlo was a revolutionary not because of her Sex life but because of her Art. Her Art spoke for the pain in her back, the pain in her heart and the her belief in the people. However none of these thoughts reach the screen instead we get another based on a book trite Bio-pic. Frida is objectified and marginalized into cliches that we can easily dispose of into trash cans. The Film Frida tries to be on par with films such as Polluck or Lust for Life(Van Gogh, Kurt Douglas) which show the passion and reasons why these tortured masters painted the way they did. Instead the audience gets to see a whore, a drunk and empty, deformed characture that is pale in comparison to the real person. Frida was revolutionary because she painted such beauty in a time when everyone copied Picasso, Pop and Polluck. Frida's use of color stands far above her contemporaries. Diego Rivera painted Frescos when no one was. Instead the film choose to show ""You are who you have Sex with instead of the Artist"". Save your money or go see The Two Towers again This Film is not worth your time or money.",2003
8,"If compared the former version of the director Paul Leduc with the present one of Julie Taymor, one should acknowledge that this version is more attractive for most of the fans of cinema. The former one is very original since there were no dialogues in the film but you should know something about Frida in order to understand the person and the context where she developed herself. Here Salma Hajek reflects all virtues and sins of this Mexican revolutionary woman. It was also easy to see the existing differences between two famous Mexican muralists, Diego Rivera (Alfred Molina) and Alfaro Siqueiros (Antonio Banderas). The first one was an anti Stalinist while Siqueiros followed the orders of the Soviet dictator. Both were violent men. Siqueiros and other communists pro Stalin were in fact responsible for the barbarian murder of Trotsky. In the case of Frida, she was well represented by Salma Hayek as a revolutionary, left wing of doubtful communist ideas, lesbian and intensive lover. The disorder of her marriage with Rivera it is well shown in the film, as well as their incredible love for each other.",2004
3,"If you already like the person, then it won't matter what I say. However, a more objective look will reveal that not only Frida the movie sucked; but so Frida, the person portrayed, herself. Especially as an artist. Her life story feels more like a bad TV movie of the week. Yes; it's sad what happened to her. But so what? A lot of other folks had it tougher out there, and you don't see them claiming their 15min of fame or their remaining heir's movie making deals. Why do I have to care about these overrated morons in the first place? I know; because Hollywood told me to. Better stated; their bourgeois friends, whether still living, or otherwise. Nevermind that's an excuse for a liberal gloryfest.- Well, there you go; I guess that's the reason this wasn't made into a film before. It's simply uninteresting. Even the supposedly racy issues. There's nothing I found controversial. I actually wish there was something; that would have make it less boring. I just didn't care for her romances; I found her art void, insipid, infantile, unmoving, overrated and lame; since she couldn't draw better that a 5yo. Also I thought her decisions were stupid, and by extension, so her overall existence. Bias notwithstanding, the only other group that overall liked it were mexicans; unsurprisingly. Sheeple that had some epiphany about her art or liked this movie experience are obv on some weird peyote stuff. I must admit that as a comedy, this works way much better. I laughed so hard at her misfortunes and stupidity that I almost cried. And after all their marriage was a joke too. As a matter of fact; the most interesting part revolves around the Trotsky murder affair, pun intended. Since this is also as much about Diego as it is about Frida. It makes sense to focus on him; because he was the most recognizable talent of the two. She simply comes of as arrogant, pedantic accessory; and being the greatest thing since the invention of the guacamole. The graphic style of the movie was the main thing that kept me watching throughout. Alfred's performance was adequate; and I most also grant that Selma looked and owned the part too. However, that's not enough in my book to gave it a positive review; merely an extra star. And the accents were bothersome and appalling too; specially of the secondary characters. I also knew right away the movie was never meant to be great since it was done in the English lang, not in Spanish. I mean; how many other Spanish Frida movies are out there; besides documentaries? Zero I think, and for a good reason. In the end, I just couldn't care less who Frida Kalho was before; and now that I know, I just despise her. And that is how powerful the effect this movie had on my perception of her...",2013

I like to be reminded of my own personal experience (which is similar) and compare it to what the main character goes through in the movie. I suppose you'll like it if it means something to you, so if you've got issues with your past (relationships, particularly) and you like happy endings, give this film a shot. There's a bit of stereotyping in the film though, but they're presented humorously, so I didn't really mind. Besides, they aren't very damaging stereotypes (at least in my view), nor very annoying ones.",2005

While I generally love Reese Witherspoon in many movies (Election and Freeway are awesome) neither she nor the other good actors could rescue the bad story, two-dimensional characters and poor writing in this trite movie. C'mon gals, do women really act like this? Would you treat good people who love you like that? No way. Why do male screenwriters decide to portray us like this anyway? At the end of the movie I said out loud, ""This must have been written by a man"". Sure enough: (Story By, Screenplay By, Directed By) all men. ",2004
3,"This film had good intentions I guess, but it didn't really come off that way to me. This film is about a woman who is about to marry a nice guy politician from New York but has to go home and divorce her ex-husband who refuses to sign the papers. The films general message is that success and being rich in life aren't important, having babies, cooking, getting drunk and pottering about doing not much is what life's about. I'm not so arrogant as to say it's a wrong message, I am a lazy person, it agrees with me! But the problem starts with the fact you are supposed to love this up herself girl who comes back and insults her former friends and you just don't find that happening. This film tries to twist and surprise you which it doesn't do and you find her transition, jumpy and forced, instead of a steadily realisation she just seems to wake up or click instantly into this next stage of realisation (after punching a woman in the face.. hmmm.. our heroine suddenly develops a very strong south American accent and this quick transition comes across as purely ridiculous.

It's not meant to be a serious movie, just something to make you laugh go awwwww. If anything it portrays New York as a crowded dirty place...and it is..but not everyone in New York is rude...um OK, maybe I take that one back.

Josh Lucas makes a fabulous performance as Jake, her estranged high school Hubby who's never got her out of his mind. If you are in the mood for a good old fashioned romance with some great country thrown in then this is the one for you, i've lost count how many times i have seen this now and i'll never tire of it.

2,"First let me say that I WANT to like this movie. I adore Reese Witherspoon, and I think she does a terrific job in this movie, and for that I want to like it. But OMG the storyline! It's infuriating! Truly, truly infuriating. I agree with another reviewer who wrote that this could only have been written by a man (and it was). Essentially, there's a girl who lives in a tiny town which would be best described as Dirthole, Alabama. She longs for a different life, so she leaves her husband (whom she married just out of high school because she was pregnant (lost the child, so no baby character to worry about)), she trots off to NY, makes a big name for herself as a fashion designer, and gets engaged to the mayor's son, who is not only sexy and hot but also exceedingly kind, generous, and nice. She has to journey back to AL to force her no good husband to sign the divorce papers she's been sending him for the past 7 years and which he has repeatedly refused to sign. While there, wouldn't you know it, she gets sucked back into the 'charm' of the crap hole that she left and the siren call of her ex's blue eyes. This movie totally ignores the fact that maybe this girl really does need something bigger and better than the miserable little town she came from, and it also totally ignores the fact that she managed to make something incredible of her dream. For that alone the authors should be punished. Furthermore, they imply that she's going to throw it all down the drain to return to Hillbilly land in order to reunite with her ex and his hound dog. WHY, is what I want to know. By writing this storyline, the authors suggest that Melanie's dream wasn't really a big deal, and they expect us to just accept their claim that her ex Mr. Blue-eyes is really the love of her life. Well, I never saw it, I don't accept it, and it just infuriates me that Melanie's character so lightly and easily tosses away everything she worked her butt off for over seven years. And don't get me started on the abominable way she treats her fiancé, who is probably the most decent character in the movie. Gaaahhhh! This Melanie character makes women look either idiotic or like big fat liars.",2010

2,"Yet another moronic Hollywood film full of condescending stereotypes of Southern Whites, ""Sweet Home Alabama"" is one of the dullest movies of the new Millennium. Melanie (Reese Witherspoon) deserts a husband in Alabama for the Big Apple, where she becomes a successful fashion designer, but she waits until she's engaged to the Mayor of NYC's son, seven years later, before she gets serious about seeking a divorce. We are then subjected to a long, boring story about Melanie trying to get her husband to sign the divorce papers. Along the way, we meet characters with names like ""Lurleen"" and learn that banks in Alabama don't have ATMs. It seems that virtually all Southern Whites live in either antebellum mansions or run-down shacks. (I lived in the Deep South for three years and it ain't like this.) We get to hear sagacious bits like: ""You can take the girl out of the honky tonk, but you can't take the honky tonk out of the girl."" We are also subjected to lame attempts at humor, like when Melanie sits in her father's recliner and falls far back when the handle is pulled - HA! HA!. Hollywood likes to portray Southerners as a bunch of ignorant neanderthals, but what can you say about the intelligence and sophistication of anyone stupid enough to have been involved in the screenplay, direction and production of this bomb.",2009

3,"Had this movie been made forty years ago, it would've starred Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward; it's that kind of story-- a romantic and lusty foray into the human condition that takes truth, honesty and love into consideration while examining the relationships of those involved.  As for the Newman/Woodward fantasy, as an audience we could only be so lucky. Because `Sweet Home Alabama,' directed by Andy Tennant, coasts with a `Fast Food Generation' sense of romance, and from frame One any `lusty' aspects of the film would be more aptly defined as `dusty,' `musty' or `rusty.'  If this is a reflection of the sense and sensibility of romance in the new millennium, then just stop the world now and let me off.",2002

Diane Lane was the main reason i got this film out because i had heard so many good things about her performance and that she has won the Oscar nomination for best actress in the films main role. Well, the hype was true. The film is excellent and Diane is seductive, sexy and downright awesome as the films main focus. She proves here what many believed before... she is a beautiful and talented star capable of carrying a movie.

10,This film is not what you expect it to be. The trailers have you thinking it's another thriller along the lines of A Perfect Murder or Fatal Attraction but it is much.much more than that. Unfaithful is a superbly directed and superbly acted character study and the tragic consequences of someone's actions. It sounds very familiar but it isn't. It's a first class and very absorbing thriller with a stand-out performance by award winner Diane Lane. In fact it is Diane Lane's unforgettable performance which lifts Unfaithful from superb to greatness. A new classic of the genre has been delivered and delivered with style and heart.,2003

And this surprises me immensely, because I was overwhelmed by it. I expected quite a good, slightly arty film with good performances (particularly from Diane Lane, who really impressed me in Coppola's ""The Cotton Club""). What I got was a film which I think will be one of my favourites for many years to come.",2003

8,"I had to sift long and deep for a good comment on this. Why all the hostility? I think there was great chemistry on this production and it shows; the actors and crew involved loved the game and had a good time making this. This movie successfully recreated the feel of the game, and because it kept exposition to a minimum of what you needed to know for this particular story and didn't borrow from or revise any of the original characters or settings, it supported and strengthened the franchise. No story is retold here, no words are wasted, the setting, feel and pace is familiar to fans of Resident Evil and yet it's perfectly accessible to those unfamiliar with the broader storyline. Not giving the fan-boys their favorite characters was a good choice since characters tend to get mangled in adaptation, and yet the fan-boys still complain. With this film you have a good, watchable story that can partake of the Resident Evil cosmology, showing it due respect.",2005

Movie was great, actors were good enough, and there was actually a plot (whoa!). Director has done a great job by having that videogame atmosphere by use of light, but still keeping the movie tense. Marilyn Manson has also made a great job by composing some of his greatest soundtrack titles which really fit for this movie. I have played both Resident Evil and Resident Evil 2, and recognized many of the scenes which were kind of similar to games. What can I say? For the people who have played games, this one gives good vibes and they are going to love it. For regular people the movie might be above the average. This was one hell-of-a-movie, and I'm waiting for the sequel.",2002

It had flaws, some acting was poor, but still was one great time from start to finish and excellently crafted entertainment!!!!!

I especially love Michelle Rodriguez's portrayal of Pain; amazing character. ",2008

7,"This movie means business. Quick disaster with a mystery to it, jarring deaths, naked Milla, all in the first few minutes. It keeps up the pace throughout. In terms of critical comments, yes, you don't really care about the characters, but so what? How often do you really care about the monster fodder in horror films? And true, it wasn't a literal working of the movie, it didn't take place in a mansion and it didn't involve exploring lots of rooms and solving puzzles. That's because it's a movie. A literal translation of Resident Evil would probably be really dull. Games and movies are very different mediums. I don't think some people here understand that. One guy said he thought the movie rocked but after repeated viewings he thought it sucked, and that's a video game player attitude - movies don't have to have good replay value, it's okay to enjoy them once. I only enjoyed Star Wars once, but I don't think it sucked, it just didn't have a lot of depth. Not every movie has to be Citizen Kane. ",2003

This is a great movie based on a video game, this is the kind of movie that we need if we are talking about basing it on a video game. I haven't seen a good one since Mortal Kombat.

There was a story and it DOES deserve a good vote and a good opinion of what a normal, everyday woman will think. OK, I might not be normal, but I generally have good opinions about movies.

10,"I am a huge fan of the video game series; I've played & completed almost every Resident Evil game there is. When the film was announced I thought it was going to be rubbish because mostly films that are based on games are completely crap especially the ones made by Uwe Boll, but I still went to see it the first day when it came out in the UK and it was sooooo amazing. I was speechless after I seen the film, the story is truly original and one of the best thing about it is that the first 10 minutes was slow & peaceful but then it went really fast & relentless just like a roller-coaster going up slowly & zoomed down. Paul W. S. Anderson has proved that he is terrific writer & director because it is extremely difficult to create a story for a film that is based on a video game. Milla Jovovich was undoubtedly the best and I loved her red dress to bits, it definitely did suit her. Watching the film gives you a deep insight of the game e.g.",2007
10,"I want to start off by saying that I was blown away by this movie. I am a big fan of horror movies. And seeing as most video game to movie adaptions are utter complete crap, I wasn't expecting too much from this movie. This movie grabbed my attention from the first frame and held it to the very end. I know what you're thinking....""Resident Evil a '10'?"" Let me tell why this is is so well done. The games mostly focus on a company doing genetic experiments and create zombies. Mayhem ensues. The movie starts out telling you a little about the corporation. Not too much to make it a drawn-out scene, but to give enough to know what is going on. Anderson then makes a seamless transition from the intro right into the lab. The opening scene is done so well, without using a lot of dialogue and letting the music build up the tension. The score really makes the movie. A different score would have made this just another zombie flick, but Manson does his best work to date. (And I'm a big Manson fan who owns all his albums. I am eagerly awaiting his next release after hearing the Resident Evil theme.) The score starts with an ominous sound, followed by a creepy keyboard intro and a simple driving bass riff. As the song progresses, more and more tension builds as drums, guitar and the other sounds are added. This song is short, but works so well with the opening sequence in establishing the tone of the movie. Gothic, haunting and creepy all at the same time. Now about the other fronts. This isn't on the same level as some other movies. It isn't a brilliantly written script. The subject matter isn't very intellectual, but rather primal and savage. When making the judgment, you have to view the movie for what it is. A fun, gore-filled thrill ride. The actors don't do anything oscar-worthy, but they do portray their characters well. The make-up work IS oscar-worthy. While its not on the same level as something like Lord of the Rings, it is still quite amazing in its own right when seeing how many zombies they have to create. I would say the film is well-directed, seeing as the director did make an enthralling movie that kept me glued to my seat for the entire time. I don't think I've been so brought into the world of the film then with this movie. I also jumped at a few parts, which is doesn't happen often. This also has one of the best endings I've seen in a movie. So far, this is hands down the best horror movie I've seen in 2002, one of the best movies of 2002 and one of my favorite movies of the horror genre. I'd place right next to Night of the Living Dead, the other masterpiece. In fact, you could almost call this a modern version of the 1968 classic. Now, for the poor reviewers I have this to say. You probably didn't like this just because Romero didn't direct it. And while I consider Night a classic, I hated the other 2 movies in the Dead trilogy. And you can't say the movie didn't capture the spirit of the game. If anything, it captured it all to well. As with all movies, there are those who love and those who hate. My advice? Give this a try expecting nothing and just watch and enjoy the movie. You'll thank me later.",2002
1,"Many reviewers consider this to be one the best adaptations of a video game into a film...Well, I have to disagree, mostly because I love all the Resident Evil games, and even when this is much better than things such as ""Doom"" or ""Bloodrayne"", it is just doesn't make any justice to the original games in which this movie is inspired.",2010

There comes the lead's name, the mirror, the rabbit, and the Red Queen. There's that scare factor about what will happen next. When will the zombies first appear? Who may get killed first? The jump scares are well done. ",2014
4,"Relatively fun to watch, Resident Evil, is a decent enough action film. Hard to take seriously and lacking in atmosphere, suspense and any real depth is does not, however, do the games justice. The games are cinematic in quality and create an atmosphere and potential for adaptation into a truly great film. Why the venture was given to Anderson i will never know, adept at action, he appears to lack the depth of creativity and understanding that is needed to develop a truly good film. Resident Evil had the potential to be one of the scariest films ever made and instead it has been violated and torn apart until all that has been left of the masterful composition of the game is a few lousy references and a distant memory of an engaging story. It is as if someone has played the games, seen the cinematic potential, then thrown all that out the window, focusing on creating a self-involved 'cool' film that tries to hard, yet fails more often than succeeds. The replacement of the atmospheric music with the noise-like 'angst ridden metal' is laughable and becoming a touch clichéd. Whilst it has its moments, Resident Evil, does not live up to its name and frankly should have be made by someone with more respect for the games, their creators, their fans and film-making in general.",2005
1,"As a fan of both George Romero's films and the original video games I found this movie to be horrible. No, I don't expect every film based on a game (or a book) to be identical to the source material. What's wrong with this film is what's been wrong with movies (especially horror) for the last fifteen years. It caters to the short attention spanned. Quick and illogical cuts peppered with bad camera tricks took me right out of this movie.

This was one of the better movies that i have seen in a long time.  Jim Caviezel's performance is slightly whiny to begin with, but in the context of the whole story, the reason therefore is appreciated and makes his transition and growth as a character that much more riveting to watch.  I absolutely loved him as Edmund Dantes then the dynamic Count of Monte Cristo and cannot have imagined a better choice.  He was definitely not bad on the eyes either.  Every scene had him looking more dashing and more handsome than the one before.",2003
10,"The Count of Monte Cristo is such an under-rated gem.  Great performances, exciting story, and a fun wit, this film has everything that was terrific in Dumas' original novel and then twists it all up to adapt perfectly to the screen but doesn't stray to far.",2003
10,"Seeing an advance Screening of 'The Count of Monte Cristo', and having only seen one advertising TV spot before hand, I really did not know what I was going into this time.  I vaguely recalled it being an Alexander Dumas book, and former film/TV versions featuring rather depressing prison scenes with men tunneling to the freedom of the Sea.  Indeed, despite its wonderful locations and details, once the afore-mentioned prison scenes of this version presented themselves I was set to be depressed again and wondered where the story was going.  And then several wonderful things happened; A whole new group of characters were introduced to our rather whiney protagonist - some good, some very bad.  And by the time said Protagonist had escaped the Prison, he too had become wonderfully evoked and dynamic, and I wanted to see him get everything he wanted and deserved: REVENGE. From then on this film was a barrage of wonderful scripting (the adaption being perfect in its pacing and wit), characters, acting, events, costumes, action, suspense and romance.  The audience laughed with genuine awe as each new moment or detail was revealed to us in the plans of the main character's (played perfectly, from his innocent beginnings to his scheming later years)steps towards that end.  This movie was amazing, with very cool performances from Guy Pearce and the rest of the supporting cast, each figure getting his or her share of good lines.  The tale of vengeance is well-balanced with tales of friendship, questing and plotting, and romance, and all of the implications each relationship holds, be it good or bad.  At times the theater openly applauded twists or returning characters.  It is perfectly timed and written, with powerful moments and style, and I would recommend it to ANYONE.",2002
7,"One of the most famous revenge stories, The Count of Monte Cristo is here turned into a dashing, old-fashioned swashbuckler. The plot is riddled with unconvincing coincidences and occurences (as indeed was the book), but other than that this is a well-made, enjoyable film, with some literate dialogue and believable action sequences. It is the fact that the action is believable that makes the film memorable, because in too many 2002 releases the action was so overblown and unrealistic (not to mention physically impossible) that the credibility of such films was destroyed.",2004

Who could ask for more? Kick back and enjoy this fun adventure flick worth a trip to the video store. (A-)",2002
9,"It's kind of strange, my wife and I just recently rented Rob Roy.  I remember hearing that it was quite good when it was released in the 90's. And although I can't say it was a bad film, I can't really say it was all that satisfying.  It had it's moments but it is not one that will linger with any real distinction in my mind.  Usually films in that time frame intrigue me and it was a little disappointing to see such an average film with a pretty good cast.  On the other end of the rainbow, you have this film.  Now even though this is not exactly the same time frame, it is that ""type of film"".  You know, old England, old France, old whatever.  It is pre-1900's.  I put all kinds of films into this category.  Anything from Braveheart to Man In The Iron Mask to Quills all falls neatly into this type of category.  Just like you would say anything from Nosferatu to Nightmare On Elm Street is horror, anything pre-1900 is in this ""type of film"" category.",2002

1,"This film was an unfortunate waste of time and money. As an English teacher that teaches the classics, including The Count of Monte Cristo,I was amazed to find few similarities between the novel and this film, and these similarities were questionable at best. The vengeful plot of the Count is a beautifully woven, romanticized, psychological, thriller. After Dantes is wrongfully imprisoned on the Château d'If, he plans to take vengeance on the men who were responsible for destroying his life. These men were Danglars, Villefort,and Fernand--who was not a friend of Dantes, but the man who took away his love. Because of these men Dantes lost everything that was dear to him, including the women he loved, Mercedes--who was not pregnant by Dantes and who waited 18 months before she married her cousin. It was from the pressure of prison that Dantes carefully calculated the methods he would use to get his revenge. He wanted it to be a slow and painful suffering--because a quick death was too good for these men. None of this tension is evident in the film. The film bastardized a novel that was full of tension and suspense, which keeps readers wanting to find out what happens next. This was Hollywoods way of chasing the almighty buck. This film did little to make me or my students want to watch it. My juniors and seniors, who are not always focused on reading, are thoroughly engaged in the novel because of Dumas' masterful writing. Several students have seen the film and have made the same comment I have made--this is film for people who have never read the book. So, stay out of the video store, save your money, grab the book out of the library,sit down and let Alexandre Dumas take you on a thrilling adventure that will keep you turning the pages.",2005
1,"Because The Count of Monte Cristo is possibly my favorite book, I was very excited when I saw that not only were they making another movie version, but that this version would also star the wonderful Guy Pearce. Unfortunately the only real connection between the movie and the book was the title. Now, I'm not one to demand that the movie mirror the original literature exactly...that's just not possible, especially with a book like this. However, the movie simply ignored the entire message of Dumas' story by cutting the final scene (although I suppose that was necessary once they decided to eliminate 3 major characters).  In my mind this is inexcusable. Why even tell the story if you're going to controvert the entire point of the book?  Outside of that (major) gripe, not much else in the movie impressed.  The acting was mediocre at best, as were the fight scenes. And the plot and timing seems very forced at some times; some of this is inevitable when converting a book this long into a 100-minute movie, but it certainly could have been done better. So basically, if you haven't read the book you might enjoy the movie to some extent, but if you've read and enjoyed the book then stay away.",2003

Not 5% of the dramatic events in the novel are captured in this movie. Also casting is not all that good. You fail to see the hard determination and the extreme power of the count. Movie is really disappointing. (Specially if you've read the novel) Yeah, its true that many movies made after novels fail to capture the elegance of the original story.

Yes, it is nothing like the book, but they really are just two versions of the same story. The movie contains an ending we expect, while the book is more realistic. One added scene I did greatly enjoy was Abbe Faria teaching Dantes combat, which never happened in the book.",2006
6,"Before I get into the review, may I just say, ""Read the book!"" It is phenomenal! I could not put it down and I now own it. That said, I must say that the first time I saw the film version starring Jim Cavaziel and Guy Pearce, I was terribly disappointed. Not that the performances were bad, but it was quite unlike the book and I, unfortunately a purist, had major issues with all the divergences from the original plot. I have no desire to spoil the movie for anyone, so if you would like to see what I mean, please read the book. I went away from the movie quite upset, but I have seen it a few times since then and I have to say that, though it is no match for the book, it does stand quite well on its own. If one were to go into the movie knowing nothing of the story, it would be quite enjoyable. The performances by Cavaziel, as the vengeful Count, and Pearce, as the villainous Fernando, are without equal. Cavaziel smolders with pent-up rage and Pearce slithers his way through every scene like the snake his character is. Wonderful! To be honest, I do have to say that the woman playing Mercedes was not convincing, nor was the actor who played her son, Albert, but in the face of the other great performances, this is not really a big issue. It is unfortunate that the leading lady felt her character needed to be a weak, sighing woman, which in the book she is decidedly not, but I choose to forgive this because really, the rest of the movie is fantastic. Every human emotion is captured in this picture, from rage to disappointment, love to hate. I would recommend this movie, though with the proviso that if you have read the book, don't expect the movie to overly faithful. In fact, you may want to watch a few times so you can fully appreciate the differences!",2005

A hideous genetic creation from the lab of mad-scientist ""Jumba,"" (David Ogden Stiers) project Six-Two-Six is put on board a space ship to be  banished to a nice little deserted asteroid, where he can live out the rest of his days. On the way there, project Six-Two-Six takes over the ship, and then escapes using what looks like a space squad car.  He eventually crash lands on one of the islands of Hawaii (Kauai?)  where a little five-year old orphan girl named ""Lilo"" (Daviegh Chase) finds him in a dog pound (don't ask) and takes him home as her new pet dog, ""Stitch"" (Chris Sanders).  Of course the Grand Council soon realizes what has happened, and sends agent ""Pleakley"" (Kevin McDonald) along with the mad-scientist to the island to recapture experiment Six-Two-Six.",2002
8,"This was a pretty entertaining ""kids"" animated film. It was a little different in that there is some dramatic action you usually don't see in nice animated cartoons and you have heroes who aren't exactly good role models. However, as the film progresses, all those characters (small child, big sister and alien) all become nicer and more caring ""people."" There also is a good ""no one is left behind"" family message. You just have to be patient with the human kid and sister in the beginning.",2006
10,"I don't know why this film didn't do better at the box office. This is perhaps Disney's best animated film to date. It rivals anything by Pixar. Why? Very simple really and it's what Pixar keeps doing so well. They tell a good story filled with well developed characters. Not to mention the animation is excellent and the watercolor backgrounds beautiful. Watch it a second or third time just to look at these fantastic pieces of art! I hope Disney learns a lesson here (from DVD sales at least) that 2-D animation isn't dead if done right and Lilo & Stitch was done right. I purchased the DVD for my daughter, okay, for me too but she loves it and while only almost four, she gets the themes. (although it took her a while to understand Nani is Lilo's sister and not her mother). The special features are good. The Hawiian Children's Choir and Hula segments especially good. I liked the deleted scene feature and would like to see them added for a later release. Disney should have marketed this film better. I would have liked to have seen it on the big screen. Personally, I don't care for Disney as a company but if they keep producing work like this, I'll keep coming back.",2005
9,"Disney's animation department (until the purchase of Pixar) had, to tell the truth, fallen into a bit of a dark age as the 90s drew to a close. The films were getting muddled with executive desires, and as a result went ridiculously over budget, and needless to say ultimately often bombing at the box office and/or with critics as a consequence. Only the Pixar films and, to a lesser extent, DTV sequels (themselves not exactly the brightest bulbs in the chandelier) were really the only new animated films from Disney that were making money. Whilst a number of Disney's animated films of the early 2000s are fine (""Home on the Range"" and ""Brother Bear"" are, in particular, both fun flicks), they certainly don't quite live up to the best of Disney animation.",2006
8,"Yes, it's a sad fact that Disney, the family favourite for close to a century, have fallen into decline. All the same, it annoys me no end when people go on about how 'The Lion King' of 1994 was the last truly great film that the company produced, because, in their period of decline and lack of success, the House of Mouse still surprised us all by churning out one cracking exception - the sassy and heartwarming 'Lilo and Stitch'.",2004
10,"I was disappointed with the comments of a previous reviewer called ebayanderson concerning this movie as I feel that he/she is not living in the real world. Lilo and Stitch is one of my favourite Disney movies as it covers so many topics and covers them well. Firstly, concerning Lilo's feeding the fish, well, all kids have little quirks and this is obviously meant to be her's. As for Nani being a care giver, well, she's supposed to be in her teens, dealing with her parents's loss as well as dealing with her sister's and taking care of the little girl under the pressure of keeping her family together, finding work etc. and it was nice as my 14 year old daughter pointed out, that Nani was like a real woman, with her little pot belly and not very stick thin build, for me she is a great character for little girls who have to put up with cartoon females such as the impossibly(pardon the pun)thin Kim Possible, which is sadly also a Disney cartoon girl. Actually, I tend not to look too deeply into movies unless they are there to make us do so, e.g Schindler's List, but, this movie covered some subjects that I am familiar with, a young child losing it's parents and it dealt with them well. The scene where Stitch takes the bicycle, well, how could anyone feel sorry for the little girl considering she is the monstrous brat in the movie. Anyway, I love the movie and I've watched it many times and am a hand on heart Stitch fan. Chris Sanders came up with an awesome character and he and Dean DuBlois did an excellent job in bringing him to life. they managed to make a movie that touched your heart with out being sickly or distressing a la Bambi. 10 out of 10",2004

The setting is fairly unique.  I have to say, Disney's animation people can do something besides make bad sequels after all.",2002
8,"I don't know why the animators decided to use the ballroom scene from Beauty and the Beast to advertise the film. It did put me off seeing it, but when I eventually decided to do so, I am glad I did. I thought Lilo and Stitch a warm and entertaining film, with beautiful animation with the Hawiian coast. The characters were engaging and funny, especially Jumbaa(wonderful voice work from David Ogden Stiers, in fact all the voice work was terrific, the other standout being Tia Carrere) and Pleakley. Their scenes were hilarious, like Pleakley getting bitten by mosquitoes. This is all helped by a superb script, that mixes hilarious and poignant brilliantly. The music is lovely and quite nostalgic. I thought I would never say that, but it honestly does add to the sense of fun. Both Lilo and Stitch are engaging, and there are plenty of bonding scenes with them together, that makes the film often moving(I was genuinely touched by Lilo telling Stitch about her parents and the significance of the Ugly Duckling story). I have two criticisms with the movie, and they are that at times it is a bit slow, and the climax is a tad rushed. But both flaws are redeemed by the film's good nature, emotional heart and spirit. I will award Lilo and Stitch an 8/10, for entertainment and warmth. Bethany Cox",2009

Back at the time, I was a 21 year old soldier, serving my third and last year of obligatory service in the Israeli army, counting the days left until I could be a civilian again. Anyway, I remember coming home one Friday after two weeks at the army, and I was all tired and worn out. Luckily enough, my ex-Girlfriend (we just started dating at the time) insisted we go out for dinner and a movie. I could still taste the gourmet meal I ate, and smell the popcorn that greeted me upon entering the theater. Needless to say, I wasn't the film buff I am now back then, and I entered Lilo & Stitch without any previous knowledge about what to expect.",2007
10,"I deliberately saw this film again recently having read some of the comments in a quiet moment. I was amazed how some people saw this movie: Most specifically the negative comments. While I appreciate that we're all different, I am at a loss to understand how anyone could not have loved this film? Did some people really think it was too violent, not suitable for children and most bizarrely of all that Lilo was nasty and aggressive? This is a young girl who is poor, teased at school for being ""different"" and who has recently lost both her parents in a car crash and she is a therefore a terrible role model for kids??? Lilo was gorgeous, in every way. Disney captured with stunning beauty and accuracy the mannerisms of a troubled child, a little lost, scared and angry, but also sweet, (wanting to pay for her pet herself) loving, (the home made doll she returns to) clear thinking (not feeding Pudge the fish, tuna sandwiches) and hopeful (the constant photo taking of ""family"" people that she so yearns for).",2009
8,"Although the animation is traditional, ""Lilo and Stitch"" is quite modern and refreshing movie. It has a charm characteristic to previous Disney productions combined with a really ingeniously-done action (the beginning and the end of the flick). Every single character is lovable - moving and hilarious at the same time. Stitch is a character which matches all the icons from classic animated films and one can utter its name along with Shrek or Duffy Duck. A very typical for such pictures message - the glorification of the family is given in a touching way and does not spoil an enormous fun. The script is full of interesting, a bit surrealistic ideas and funny dialogues. This movie is a worthy addition to the best productions of Walt Disney studio. I definitely recommend it to the whole family.",2006
10,"'Lilo & Stitch' is truly one of the oddest Disney films you will ever see. It all started with the gut-busting ad campaign: The titular monster Stitch showing up in classic Disney movies and genuinely wreaking havoc in them.

7,"Lately Disney seem to have had quite allot of trouble, coming up with innovative story's for their pictures, recreating folk-lore such as Mulan, Brother bear and other titles. Not to mention their pathetic sequels & ""new exclusive editions"" that've been clogging up the shelves at your local rental store. This movie however came as a pleasant surprise from Disney. Not only did it have the typical ""Disney- awwwwwww!"" feature, but also an unusual dosage of satire and ""evil-deeds"" from the cute little blue alien Stitch.",2005

If you may want to watch the movie with your child if they are young, since kids can be susceptible to fears of abandonment The other central figure, Stitch is comical and appears to be intelligent.  The animation, choice of music and gags in the movie were also good.  The plot was a little weak (especially the second half of the movie).  I rated this 7 out of 10, I'll be looking for more work from Sanders and DeBlois (the writers). Perhaps if Disney could leave a few loose ends or avoid forcing every story to an almost predictable happy ending, then the real skill of these writers might shine through.",2003

A flying saucer crashes near her house and a strange creature emerges. Actually it is a hostile alien whose the only aim is to destroy life on earth. Their paths cross. What happens when the little earth girl and the extra-terrestrial maniac meet? A funny, heart-warming story of friendship, love, family ties To be frank I was not going to see this animated film considering it to be ""little kids stuff"". But when eventually I saw it I realized how wrong I was. Disney proves its reputation for making ""family friendly"" films because this is the film in which each family member, whether it be a child or a parent, can find something for him/herself to enjoy and think about. A couple of words about music. Since Lilo is a huge Elvis fan, the soundtrack contains a lot of his songs. It is a hard task to make songs written rather long ago fit in the modern film but the producers succeeded! Recommended to all!",2005

Even with that to boot, Dean Deblois and Chris Sanders managed to come up with a respectable plot that wasn't a complete rip off of E.T. (1982) or even, well, Mac and Me (1988). It's funny to see that the average person who doesn't enjoy any type of Disney production has been favoring this movie more than others, as I feel, it's a pretty nice step for the company. Disney goes flat-out to create a funny character put into a situation where only large laughs are going to occur. The Emperor's New Groove (2000) tried so hard to accomplish that, but fell just short of a home run. `Stitch' gets that extra foot or two.",2002

10,"We've come to expect a lot from Paul Thomas Anderson. After his twin masterpieces ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Magnolia"", not to mention the sure-handed and satisfying ""Hard Eight"", we knew he was a filmmaker of skill and magic. So when it was announced that the next PTA film would be a 90-minute romantic comedy starring (Gasp!) Adam Sandler, I was, for one, not worried. This man had taken Mark Wahlberg and turned him into someone we could be proud to watch onscreen. He cast icon Tom Cruise, gave him the character of Frank ""T.J."" Mackey, and directed the actor to one of the most repulsive, offensive, and inspired performances of the ""Top Gun"" star's career. So, I was pretty confident in his ability to handle the star of ""Little Nicky"". But, boy, I still wasn't prepared for what I saw. Sandler just wasn't good, he was INCREDIBLE. I couldn't believe my eyes-here was the man behind ""Eight Crazy Nights"" creating a completely realized, utterly human character with a studied, nuanced performance. Many have commented on the fact that Barry Egan, Sandler's character, is not that different from his previous incarnations. Socially akward and prone to explosive violence, Barry might just be the key to explainging Sandler's Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore. The character helps shine a light on the inner torment of those man-children.",2003
8,"Boy, did this movie disappoint a lot of people.....but not me. The ""disappointed"" were the Adam Sandler fans who expected another ""Happy Gilmore""-type character, the kind of goofball the comedian has built a career on portraying.

Then I heard it starred Adam Sandler, who is one of my least favorite actors of all time, but even then I figured that if anyone is going to make me not want to start throwing things at Sandler's image, it would be Anderson.  After all, he got me to respect Tom Cruise after seeing `Magnolia'.  When I finally got to see the film this past weekend (after wanting to see the film for about a year) I wasn't disappointed, and I found that my trust was not misplaced.  Anderson took Sandler and turned him into a sad sack who is so psychologically screwed up he would be an analyst's dream.  Emily Watson is his perfect counterpart as a classy yet extremely quirky love interest.  ",2004

The interactions between the characters are believable. Now, grant it, romance movies still have to work out better, most of the time, than our real life romances.

Once again, the Academy shows its disrespect for comedies by not giving the film a single nomination.  Hell, ""Punch-Drunk Love"" is the best original screenplay of last year, by far.

10,"I have come to consider CHICAGO the best and most satisfying movie musical that I have ever seen. And I like movie musicals. The first delight was how well Catherine Zeta Jones, Renee Zellweger, Richard Gere, Queen Latifah, and John C Reilly did with these roles-- acting, Singing!!, and Dancing!!! I was surprised, and amazed! In addition, the cheeky satire about America's obsession with the cult of celebrity and the three-ring circus that the media and opportunistic lawyers make of our justice system is razor-sharp and very timely. (It's a little like watching ""O.J.: The Musical""!)The creative and brilliant direction by Rob Marshall is entertaining and wonderful. As I think over the films of the last ten years, this is the first one that comes to mind. I love it!! I simply can't watch without singing along! CHICAGO certainly deserved its Academy Award for Best Picture!!",2007
1,"Okay, people called ""Chicago"" the best of 2002, winning six academy awards (including Picutre). To know what the hype was all about, I rented it. After seeing a half hour of it, I could not sit through the movie because it was so awful. There are many reasons why I find it so terrible. For starters, I did not like the opening. It beings with choppy editing, jumping from Renee Zellweger's character having aggressive sex with a man to Catherine Zeta Jones dancing seductively in smashing tights.",2008

10,"Roxie Hart (Renée Zellweger) has a very simple life, married with the simple and cuckold mechanic Amos Hart (John C. Reilley), but is a dreamer. She dreams of being successful,  loved by the masses and rich, the same way Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones, in an outstanding performance) seems to be. Roxie is deceived by his lover, who had promised to present her to an owner of an important night-club only for taking sexual advantages from her and kills him. In the prison, she shares the jail with Velma, who killed her husband and her sister, and they become enemies.  She meets Matron 'Mama' Morton (Queen Latifah), an important and influent jail-keeper, and Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), an expensive lawyer who never lost a case and who decided to take care of Roxie's case. Billy tries to change their passionate crimes to a different perspective to the public opinion. Yesterday I watched this movie for the first time. What a wonderful movie! The performance of the cast, highlighting Catherine Zeta-Jones in the first plan and Renée Zellweger next is fantastic. The screenplay, where reality is saw under the vision of Roxie as a musical all the time is marvelous.  The direction is amazingly perfect for a rookie director of films. Congratulations to all cast: the Oscars wined by this film were very deserved. Renée Zellweger has proved in the past that she is an outstanding actress. Richard Gere also has many magnificent movies in his career. But Catherine Zeta-Jones surprised me a lot: I could never expect those skills on her. John C. Reilley is also a great underrated actor, but he has to be careful with his roles: this is the second time, in a short period, that he plays a cuckold (see `The Good Girl'). Honestly, I did not expect such an excellent movie. The scene of the interview of Roxie and Billy is a masterpiece. Only this scene would be enough for me. But this movie offers almost two hours of pleasure.  I only regret that the DVD released in Brazil is in fullscreen, instead of widescreen. The extras are also great. My vote is ten.",2004
1,"Cannibalising movies of the past seems to be the latest thing with the current crop of young directors.  Having no ideas of their own, they resort to lifting composition, lighting, and framing in order to sell their movie. A modern audience, which does not know the original, will scarcely notice. Let's face it a modern audience would scarcely care.  The current flavour of the month, Chicago, is a poor man's Cabaret (1972).  Director Robert Marshall should stick to choreography and directing for TV and the stage because there isn't an original, fresh idea in this mess of a film. Firstly, he ditches the balance of the two stories of Velma Kelly and Roxie Hart making the Hart story the focus of the film - bad move Mr Marshall. Secondly, he thinks he understands the structure of Cabaret (with its musical numbers kept to the stage of the Kit Kat club) so he exploits it, cutting songs to insert dialogue which is supposed to be clever but he just cuts, cuts, cuts and cuts jarringly and quickly (think Baz Lurhmann school of editing - a meat cleaver approach to a subtle art).  If you thought that Moulin Rouge was ripe offal then you are in for a treat here.  Moulin Rouge had a weak story and suffered because of it.  Chicago has a strong story but you would scarcely know it because it all is delivered at the same tempo and pace so that there are no highs and lows, just the same level of frenetic cutting and annoying close ups (there are so many of these that the whole sorry mess begins to get tedious very early in the piece).",2003
9,"CHICAGO, in my opinion, is an absolutely smashing film adaptation of the hit Broadway musical. If you ask me, Billy (Richard Gere) was a really good attorney, dancer, and singer. Despite the fact that she had no voice or dance training, Roxie (Renée Zellweger) did a very good job... especially Velma (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Mama (Queen Latifah). Amos (John C. Reilly) was good, too. I would have to choose Catherine Zeta-Jones if asked who I thought gave the best performance, though. Also, the bandleader (Taye Diggs) was a very mysterious and stylish man, even though you couldn't see him most of the time. In addition, the choreography and music were absolutely smashing. My favorite number of the movie, if I had to choose, would be either ""When You're Good To Mama"" or ""And All That Jazz."" Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this absolutely smashing film adaptation of the hit Broadway musical to any Renée Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones, or Richard Gere fan who hasn't seen it. You're in for a smashing good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.",2005
8,"""Chicago"" is the first film in eleven or ten years thoroughly determined to be a full-blooded musical (the previous one was ""Beauty and the Beast"", or just possibly ""Aladdin""), and, if there have been others, is almost certainly the best. Forget ""Moulin Rouge"". That film was terrified by the very idea of being a musical. It couldn't introduce a song without being seen to quote it rather than sing it, and would cut the song short, relieved to have it over and done with, at the soonest possible moment. But ""Chicago"" REALLY launches into its production numbers. Its songs are full-throated and lusty. (As far as the music goes, and the wit and sparkle of the lyrics, Kander and Ebb wrote far better songs for ""Chicago"" than for ""Cabaret"".) They've been staged with dazzling style.",2003
9,"Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, Broadway musicals which are heavy on concept translate poorly to film.  Live theater relies upon some level of interaction with the audience (as well as some degree of spontaneity), creating an artificial atmosphere that gives a director freedom to use staging and theatrical devices that can make the most of such interaction. By contrast, film creates an illusion of reality that makes such theatrical devices look phony.  Rob Marshall's ""Chicago"" provides the exception to this rule.",2003

10,"I had already written a review of this awhile ago(long since buried under many other reviews) but wanted to comment again because I was reading all the bad reviews and just couldn't believe it. Chicago is a masterpiece. Even if one doesn't like musicals or this is a type of film that doesn't appeal to them I don't see how anyone could argue on the direction and acting of this film. The fact is, there are not that many musicals that are worthy of winning an Oscar and this one was and did. It was amazingly put together from start to finish. I can see someone who doesn't like musicals maybe not liking the movie but if one just watches the movie objectively I can't see how the Dynamic dancing, singing, acting wouldn't overwhelm even the biggest skeptic. The movie managed to create a similar atmosphere to watching a Broadway show-it's really unbelievable because this movie so easily could have been awful.",2003

This movie has gotten all this praise and publicity and positve feedback for women glorifing the killing of men.  Now, what if the shoe was on the other foot? What if there was a film that was about a bunch of men that killed that were made famous by killing their wives or girlfriends?  Of course no one would go see that!  Every feminist group in the world would be all over that film, its producer, director, actors, and studio!  And Hollywood and the motion picture industry would come under even bigger scrutiny if that film was nominated for 13 Academy Awards.  Just something to think about",2003

1,"This was a foul movie. It was based on a much earlier musical that was a cynical attempt to cash in on the ""Cabaret"" by the same creators, and it falls short by a mile. The film, many years later, is then, by extension, despicable. Above all it is a piece of misogynist Derek, its portrayal of women an insult in every way, every one of them portrayed as venal, dimwitted, amoral, the guys that dream this up should each have their remaining testicle removed forcibly, with a rusty spoon. The songs stink, not one of them memorable. When was the last time you whistled ""Mister Cellophane""? The dancing was a joke. Fast editing made every inept performer look almost competent. They should be made to suck on Donald O'Connor's jockstrap. The acting and production values were abysmal. I would rank this down with ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" as one of the most laughable ""Oscar"" best-pics of all time. Who put the fix in? How did that work? What did the ""Stonecutters"" like about this turkey, or were they on the payroll. Name actors like Gere and Zellweger should be publicly humiliated for this. And the claims that it was a brilliantly modern, inventive film musical! Who=ever said that had no inkling of a quality product like ""Moulin Rouge,"" a truly clever and inventive recent movie musical. I cannot figure out where the public has their heads on this.",2006
10,"""The Hours"" more than lives up to its critical praise. If nothing else it is a must see for the originality of the technique.

10,"I know a lot of people criticized this film for various reasons but please do yourself a favor and do not listen to any of it. This movie touches on subjects that deeply affect those who either have struggled with mental illness or have a loved one who has. Everything about this movie resonates with me in a very deep way. When the book was getting popular before this film was ever created I went and bought it and read it. I realized about midway through that this was a book that would probably haunt me the rest of my life. I think I see much of myself in each of these women. Virginia Woolf, creative and thoughtful, deeply depressed and almost comforted by the idea of death. Laura Brown, trapped and terrified of her own existence. Clarissa Vauhn, always looking for a trivial distraction, a quiet storm brewing underneath the surface. Everyone questions the meaning of life and the value of life. Everyone thinks about happiness, and remembers the moment they were happiest. These are all mortal realities. Thoughts that plague even the strongest of individuals. Suicide sometimes seems like an inevitable fate, and even a comforting solution. The moment when you meet Laura Brown at the end of the film as an old woman, you think she is going to be this broken and sad person full of regrets but she isn't. You realize that out of all three women she was the one that ultimately chose life. After speaking with Clarissa, you can tell that Clarissa finally understands that sometimes regret is just a word that means nothing. How can you regret when you didn't have a choice? It was either death or leave. Many times in my life I have felt this way. I have left my hometown without saying goodbye to anyone and moved three thousand miles away. I felt trapped, suffocated and very dangerously depressed. When I got to my final destination I felt so free. I could write for days about this movie and it wouldn't do this film justice. If you are a woman and you struggle with mental illness do yourself a favor and watch The Hours. It will give you perspective and comfort. Life isn't always beautiful and sometimes someone has to die to create contrast so that the rest of us value life. It humbles us to see someone take their own life, it makes us squeeze our children a little tighter, makes us sing a little louder, makes us love a little deeper. When Richard dies at the end of the film, you think Clarissa will fall apart and when she doesn't, and you watch this woman in shock somehow come back to life you realize that this man has been holding her back from really enjoying life. His sadness was almost an anchor for her and when he disappears it almost releases her from this darkness that surrounded him. You realize that he really was only sticking around for her. She watches him jump and it's almost like a relief to her. The darkness goes with him. One of the best scenes of the film is almost at the very end. Meryl Streep so passionately kisses her partner. It's beautiful. You can tell she is choosing life. She wants to feel that happiness she once felt again. This movie changed my life. I will never be the same.",2014
9,"Nicole Kidman is writing a book, Julianne Moore is reading the book, Meryl Streep is the book. A brilliant conceit by master David Hare, astonishingly performed by Nicole Kidman, Meryl Streep, Ed Harris, Toni Collette, John C Railly, Allison Janney,Stephen Dillane, Miranda Richardson Jeff Daniels and Clare Danes, even Eileen Atkins in a tiny, but revelatory moment, as the flower shop owner, is a true standout. Nicole Kidman's Virgina Woolf is a bit of a miracle, specially now, 5 years later, when you can actually look at her without noticing her nose. What you do notice is her thinking, her beautifully torturous battle for sanity - whether conscious or unconscious - ""Even crazy people want to be asked!- she blurts at her sister to admonished her for not having been invited to a party. Kidman is truly sensational as is Meryl Streep, although one has come to expect that and that's why Kidman makes the bigger splash. Julianne Moore however, as the depressed perfect mother/wife of the 1950's, took me completely out of the emotional tornado Kidman and Streep consistently nurture and provide. Her performance is a performance and I was painfully aware of the machinery working just behind her eyes. Regardless ""The Hours"" is a rewarding experience a totally accessible intellectual and emotional ride.",2007

8,"""The Hours"" is an extremely intelligent movie. It's deep and sensitive and the script is something different for a change. The acting couldn't get any better. EVERY role was casted perfectly. I never really liked Nicole Kidman but she is a fantastic actress and at the moment she just chooses the right roles. She definitely deserved the Oscar. Juliane Moore is amazing, too. I wonder if there is any genre she can't do. And then, there's Meryl Streep. Will this woman ever stop being great? I mean after all the great movies she's been in in the 80's, she's still making exceptional films such as ""Adaptation"" and ""The Hours"", whereas other actors who were great 10 years ago pretty much lost it today *cough*Pacino*cough*DeNiro*cough, cough*. The director did a wonderful job and the score is another big plus of this movie. The haunting music underlines the depressing all around atmosphere and lets one feel how miserable these main characters are all the time. At times I felt like these women's sadness was explained too little, though. Maybe that's manly ignorance but I couldn't totally figure out why Juliane Moore's character was so depressed all the time. It was a little annoying that she never stopped crying and you couldn't tell why. I paid attention and I did try reading between the lines but that was a mystery to me. Probably just a personal problem. All in all I think this is the 2nd best movie of 2003's Oscar movies (1st being ""The Pianist"", 3rd ""About Schmidt"").",2004
7,"To fulfill the ""guidelines"" of IMDb, I will start off by saying that I did not enjoy watching this film. However, I found it to be an incredibly accurate depiction of depression supported by impeccable acting by a knock-out cast; plus, the positivity of the final scene (for some of the characters, at least) was refreshing.",2010

1,"I was looking forward to seeing this movie, and once I did I could not believe the good reviews it got. The fine actresses did well with what little they had but the internal monologues from the book did not translate well into screen dialogue, and the pedantic, paper thin faux-feminism weighted the story down as much as those stones in Virginia Woolf's pockets. Also, I laughed out loud at a few of the scenes with Ed Harris talking about his writing, and I thought the score was intrusive. I understand a great deal of talent and effort went into this film, but the result is pretentious and annoying. I'm amazed at how many people don't notice how bad the script is. For a good movie on writers and writing see ""Wonder Boys."" For a good movie on suicide see ""Ordinary People."" For a good movie upper middle class female oppression see ""Far From Heaven.""

How about Woolf's meditations on war, gender, and violence in _Mrs. Dalloway_ and the facts (whatever one makes of them) that she was sexually molested as a child, that her suicide took place during another war, and that she and Leonard were on the Gestapo's hit list? Stripping away all the actual material facts of people's lives and times leaves all this relentless emphasis on their supposed ""feelings"" simply meaningless and manipulative. It's also extremely irritating to have the artist Vanessa Bell reduced to some fluttering mother hen looking with incomprehension at her dotty genius sister Virginia, and to have the real erotic memory at the core of _Mrs Dalloway_, the kiss with Sally, switched to a kiss with Richard, and Sally reduced to the dull spousal role that is Richard's in the novel.

Tom Noonan played a better Francis Dolarhyde, but Anthony Hopkins plays a MUCH better Hannibal. This movie fills in the blanks where Manhunter left them wide open. There's a part in the beginning where it actually shows how Will caught Hannibal. Some scenes were souped up in this movie from the original but over all it worked out. The ending of this movie was actually played out much better than in Manhunter. This movie even ends right as Silence of the Lambs begins, which helps a lot.

I also thought that they would change it around to put more of everybody's favorite cannibal in, which they really didn't. So he's in the beginning more, but that was what basically happened in flashback in the book, they only drew it out more in the movie. And the other scenes with Hannibal that were added helped to cover all the ground they needed to do with the story, and they worked perfectly. Let me explain.",2002
8,"Having seen the disappointing Hannibal, I was a bit reticent about seeing this.  The original Manhunter film was simply on the edge and excellent, and another prequel could have gone either way.",2002
9,"The movie going public is obviously well acquainted with the most famous serial killer, cannibal, in cinematic history, Hannibal Lecter.  In 2002's 'RED DRAGON,' Hannibal is back with force and vengeance, thanks to the brilliant portrayal of Sir Anthony Hopkins and inspired writing of screenwriter Ted Tally.  He's got some of the best lines in the business. 'RED DRAGON,' for the most part is a remake of Michael Mann's 1986 'Manhunter.'  Obviously there isn't a lot of variation between the two since they are both adaptations of Thomas Harris' book 'RED DRAGON.'  But that is were the simularity ends.  Sure, some scenes are structed the same, but to be fair this latest installment is closer and more true to the novel.  For those that read the book or saw 'Manhunter,' it's no surprise that Hannibal had a rather small role.  Ted Tally took some license and beefed up the character for some crucial scenes, adding a very interesting and inventive twist.  From the onset, we see the capture of Hannibal by FBI Agent Will Graham, played flawlessly this time around by Edward Norton.  We are also privy to a rather more intense Lecter, anger and resentment for being caught and put away.  Hopkins doesn't need to do much to convey his distaste for Graham, the true talent of an excellent actor.  Lecter is not over the top as many say he was in the third film 'HANNIBAL.'  But this is really not a Lecter story.  It is focused more on Graham and the new killer on the block, Francis Dolarhyde (played to an eeriely perfection by Ralph Fiennes).  One not of advisement, if 'The Silence Of The Lambs', or 'Hannibal,' gave you nightmares, you may not be prepared for 'Dragon.'  It is absolutely brutal in it's visuals and psychological mind games.  Dolarhyde, aka the 'Tooth Fairy' is a brutal serial killer who has killed two families and may be on the hunt for a third.  It is this that brings Jack Crawford (Harvey Keitel) on the quest to seek out a retired Graham.  Reluctantly, Graham decides to help with the investigation.  Graham does possess a certain gift, he can think like the killer.  But it does cause a dilemma.  The one person that could really give our detective the insight he needs is the one man who tried to kill him, Lector.  As Clarice in 'Silence' Graham must once again delve into Lecter's world of the asylum.  Frederick Chilton is back as the head of the asylum, again played by Anthony Heald (the 'old friend for dinner' guy).  Heald is an absolute delight in a awkward sort of way.  He's definetly a one off.  Basically, he's not nearly as smart as he thinks he is.  Possibly the most disturbing character of the film is played by Fiennes.  He is essentially a sympathetic killer, and yet you really want to see this guy go down.  Fiennes is stunning in this role and adds his own spark to the role.  Emily Watson plays Fiennes uninformed love interest who happens to be blind, lucky for her.  Philip Seymour Hoffman is the sleazy tabloid reporter who in time is destined to get his comupance.  It is really unfortunate that the Academy Awards does not hand out status to ensemble casts.  If they did, 'RED DRAGON,' would probably be the only nomination in the catagory.  There hasn't been a cast like this in many years.  There is an equal balance between the three main characters, Lecter, Graham, and Dolarhyde.  Lecter was in it just enough to keep it constantly fresh and on edge.  Dolarhyde takes it over the edge and Graham brings it subtly back.  Brett Ratner as the director did an excellent job in setting the scenes, the creepy atmosphere, and letting the actors do what they do best.  This film is a winner all the way around.  If any thriller were put up against 'Silence,' this may be the one that could surpass it in regards to thrills, chills and just plain excellent storytelling.  Though the 4 movies are destined to be lumped together, 'Manhunter,' 'The Silence Of The Lambs,' 'Hannibal,' and now 'The Red Dragon,' which is completely understandable, 'Dragon' stands on it's own.  And does so extremely well. This movie is obviously not for everyone.  There is graphic violence that is disturbing.  Yet in this vehicle it is not overplayed as say, your average slasher movie.  If you're going to plunk down your hard earned cash for a movie, 'Red Dragon,' is the one.  It is a good solid interesting movie that never lets go.  Once it's got you, it's got you.  And that ride starts as the lights in the theater go down.  There's not too many movies that can boast that.",2002
9,"But it was pretty damn close. ""Red Dragon"" was a great movie to watch. I have to admit that I had my doubts. I heard some bad things about this movie from my friends. I had bought the movie for my mom, and she said just to give it a shot. I'm glad I did. ""Red Dragon"" goes back into the roots that ""Silence of the Lambs"" did. It had high action and drama. I was very impressed. And Anthony Hopkins does a great job as his most famous role as Hannibal Lector. I really have to say that I didn't stick to my friend's opinions. This was a great movie. I would recommend for the ""Silence of the Lambs"" fans.",2004
7,"After the return of the infamous Hannibal Lecter to our screens in 2001 with Ridley Scott's film version of the best novel in Thomas Harris's Lecter trilogy, it's not surprising that a new version of the first novel in the series got an update a year later considering that it's previous screen version, Michael Mann's Manhunter, doesn't fit in with the other two films in the series. I do have to say that this version is both more true to Harris' novel and an overall better film than Manhunter; though it does have numerous shortfalls and has nothing on the masterpiece 'Silence of the Lambs'. The plot is quite similar to the one in Silence of the Lambs, and features a cop on the hunt of a serial killer and receiving help from the incarcerated Hannibal Lecter. FBI Agent Will Graham, the captor of Hannibal Lecter, is called out of retirement to help catch a serial killer dubbed ""The Tooth Fairy"" by the media. The killer has already slaughtered two families and the FBI believes that another one is soon to join them; meaning that Will Graham has no choice but to ask Hannibal Lecter for help with the case.",2008
8,"RED DRAGON - CATCH IT ( A- ) Red Dragon is an intriguing prequel to the Silence of the Lambs. The story and serial killer (Red Dragon) in the movie is really intriguing and thrilling. Hannibal Lecter is such an iconic character that we always wanted to see how he got caught and who did it. There is very interesting relationship and chemistry between Anthony Hopkins and Edward Norton's characters. Though, its nothing as compare to Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster's chemistry but still much better then what was between Julianne Moore and Anthony Hopkins in Hannibal. Anthony Hopkins was Outstanding as Hannibal Lecter as always, it's astonishing to see that with how much ease and relaxation Anthony Portrays Hannibal Lecter. He is scary and captivating & when he is on screen you just can't take your eyes off him. Edward Norton did a fantastic job by standing next to him. But this movie completely belongs to Ralph Fiennes, he was incredibly creepy and brilliant. Watching him in Red Dragon is simply great; I don't think there is anyone else who could have portrayed Red Dragon. The chemistry between Ralph Fiennes and Emma Watson is captivating and one of the best parts of the movie. Emma Watson as a blind woman did a incredible job. Mary-Louise Parker & Philippe Seymour Hoffman did a respectable job. Director Brett Ratner presented the movie in very intriguing and captivating way. It's nice to see a director doing completely different from its famous genre. the only flaw in the movie I found was the Cliché and quick ending of Red Dragon's character, I think it could have been little innovative and mind boggling. Nonetheless great movie, which bind a spell while watching it!",2010
10,"I felt the need to comment on this film after reading several negative opinions of it on the 'Manhunter' boards. 'Red Dragon' is, in my opinion, the better of the two. As well as the second best of all the Lecter films. I think we can all agree how great 'Silence of the Lambs' was. Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster were tremendous. Hopkins has the meatier role, so tends to get the press, but Foster's vulnerable portrayal is truly what sells the film. Then, along came 'Hannibal'. The less said about that cartoon the better. So, my hopes weren't very high for 'Red Dragon'. Especially with Mr. Rush Hour at the helm. But, I couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised. It's a very nuanced film that builds upon who Hannibal Lecter really is. The opening scenes with Lecter at the symphony, hearing those off notes; then later his sly, evil, bourgeoisie charm at the dinner party is in full effect. It gives a rich portrait of the man. And, the scene in the study with Norton and Hopkins is fabulous. The back and forth between the two is fascinating. Edward Norton has this boyish, world weary maturity that suits the character so well. And, most people fail to mention how truly terrifying and gentle Ralph Fiennes makes his Dolyrhyde. The scene where he eats the red dragon painting is fantastic. The cast on a whole is wonderful. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is the perfect sleaze tabloid reporter. You just can't wait for his liver to be served with some Chianti. All in all, I've seen this film four or five times and come to appreciate it more and more. 'Manhunter' lovers, i feel your nostalgia, but 'Red Dragon' is firing all cylinders; 'Manhunter', while original, is really just an exercise in 80's pop art...",2008
10,"I think it's better than 'Manhunter' and 'Hannibal'. Red Dragon stays exciting until the end, and that's what I like about a movie. I never expected Brett Ratner to make a movie is good as this, but hey, he did a great job. The music (Danny Elfman) was fantastic and was a good addition to an already exciting movie. The acting performances were also good, especially Anthony Hopkins (Of course) and Ralph Fiennes. I think Ralph Fiennes even deserved an Oscar nomination. Through the movie there was an ominous atmosphere which resulted in the confrontation between Edward Norton and Ralph Fiennes. I actually experienced this scene as one of the most exciting scenes I've ever seen. Nothing but good words about Red Dragon, so I'd give 5 out of 5.",2003

8,"Brett Ratner's wonderful 2002 Lecter-canon thriller Red Dragon begins in the early 1980s with Lecter on the loose, in the years before any kind of incarceration, and at large still continuing his lifestyle driven by a triple threat combined of murders, mayhem and meals wrapped up into one. The series' previous film, Ridley Scott's 2001 film Hannibal, did not have a particularly positive critical consensus; a film that rather jumped ship in having Lecter out and about around Italy and America doing what he did and evading capture, rather than indoors and creating a film revolving around a particular case that just happened to have a devilishly intriguing supporting character tossed in for measure. In beginning Red Dragon with Lecter at large, before having the film's lead figure him out in a moment of near-fatal ingenuity, Ratner addresses what perhaps he and most certainly the critical contingent saw wrong with said 2001 piece and includes an epilogue in which Lecter is at large; caught and then placed (back) in his cell. It's an event that sees both us and him have respective senses wash over us of odd nostalgia and sheer frustration at being caught.",2010

10,"I went in expecting ""Red Dragon"" to be terrible. I am a huge fan of the book by Thomas Harris. I was shocked when I came out of the movie COMPLETELY satisfied. I LOVED it. It followed the book so closely, and was done so artistically I almost couldn't believe I had seen a ""Hannibal"" movie. This went all for story and NOT for gore, the opposite of what was done with ""Hannibal"", the movie based on Thomas Harris' book of the same name. It kept all of the characters the way they should have been, and amazingly did not over use the character Hannibal, which was my biggest fear of how the movie was going to be. Instead, I was able to sit and recite the lines along with the movie the first time I saw it because it was STRAIGHT from the book. Like I've said before and I will say again, stick to what Thomas Harris writes and you'll get a good movie, don't and you get junk!! (Like Hannibal). This is a MUST SEE, especially if you like the book.",2002

10,"The prequel of Silence of the lambs is well done film. its less about Lecter and more about the nature of human evil. 16 years prior to this film was man hunter, the first movie to the adaptation of the novel. This one is better made, better of the based off the novel. you are about to meet Franices Dahlrahyde, an unspeakable human monster, who became that way threw years child abuse. The FBI nicked named him the tooth fairy. Franices hates that, because he says he becoming the RED DRAGEN. We see Dahlrahyde as a shy, very strong,heres voices of the red dragon,his abusive grandma, and a John doe serial killer, who believes he's ugly and wants to change. When fellow co-worker Reba, who's blind, gets romantically close Dahlrahyde she sees him as a human bean. This changes him, because she dose not see is ugliness. we also meet FBI agent Will graham, who has a brilliant gift of entering a killers mind. He's experienced because he captured the en genus and infamous Lector. We also meet Lecter when Will captures him, and visits him. lecter gives Will little clues to the tooth fairy because Lecter is more curious of Will s mind. The crime scene's are wickedly evil. The slides we see with Francis are also wicked, but tell how Francies wants to be reborn.",2005
6,"You can't help but to keep thinking of Manhunter and I went into this film thinking what did they have to offer that the first version didn't already do on another level? Well, it is more faithful to the book. There's no denying that. But Manhunter is clearly a much more superior film. Lecter's role is of course expanded and thats okay but lets compare the rest of the film. Edward Norton and William Petersen. Petersen's Will Graham is a very complex person with psychological problems and his family also suffers because of it. Norton's version has none of that, he's just dutiful to his job. Mary Louise Parker as his wife just sits there and nods her head! Where was the development of her character? The biggest flaw for me was Ralph Fiennes as Dolarhyde. Fiennes is really not very tall. In fact when he stands next to the wee Emily Watson he's not that much taller. Tom Noonan was a much better Dolarhyde. He stands like 6'7"" or something, a real monstrous presence. Fiennes is maybe 5'9"", MAYBE!! And now to Brett Ratner. He does a decent job here but does this film have any real style or vision? Not really, and we all know Michael Mann is a genius with his visionary style. Noonan's character was a real monster. Fiennes seems to come off as just a kook. While I didn't dislike this film, it just seems to be made by the numbers. It looks good, has great actors and is faithful to the original story. But where is the heart and vision? Manhunter had all of that, and more.",2002
10,"I read a lot of previous posts about this movie. This is one of the best films of the year, and of recent years. This is a perfect blend of action, suspense, thrills and film-noir. The plot is intelligent and fresh. People saying it is not original must have slept through the movie. Tom Cruise is fantastic, Colin Farrell is amazing, as well as Samantha Morton. Spielberg again proves that he is the master of cinema. A truly great director. I'll agree, the ending was a little too happy, but not worth complaining about. This film is not about product placement as previously suggested, it is simply a entertaining and yet realistic glimpse of what our future may look like, as advertising becomes more advanced and intrusive. The film creates many moral questions and issues, and should leave you thinking. Is being arrested for doing something you actually havn't commited yet fair? It is worth seeing again and again. As a film lover and critic, i can say it is one amazing movie.",2002
9,"The future, we are told, are what we make of it. Philip K. Dick did not want to take that chance, so he wrote many many many short stories about the future of man and where we, as a society, were headed. Blade Runner, Total Recall, Paycheck, Screamers, and Minority Report are all short stories written by Dick about the future that have been turned into a movie, and most have a less than enthusiastic view of where we are headed. In Minority Report, we see the effects of predicting the future to the point of crimes are prevented by arresting murderers before they kill. If that does not appear logical, there is a quick little scene early in the movie that addresses those concerns, and on the surface makes sense. Tom Cruise plays the Washington, DC pre-crime chief, John Anderton, who runs the investigators who rely on 3 scientifically engineered beings who can see murders before they happen. The system, of course, raises civil liberty issues, but seems to work perfectly, that is until Anderton is fingered for a murder. The rest of the movie, Anderton tries to not only prove that he is innocent, but also that he was set up, possibly by an oily Department of Justice figure who is investigating Precrime before it goes national after an election, played by Colin Farrell. Directed by Steven Spielberg, Minority Report plays as both a ""Whodunnit?"" and a futuristic exercise of science fiction. Much time was spent on designing the Washington, DC of the 2050s, including cars that run on magnets, virtual reality stations, and much more throughout the film. The most interesting design is of the ""sick sticks"" used by cops to bring down criminals. The blueish tint given to the film also gives us a cold feeling, a future that is not as loving or as hospitable as the time we live in, another trait of a Dick story. A wonderful movie the works for both the crime buff and the science fiction fan.",2005
9,"May be this film has some flaws but while watching it I wasn't too distracted by that. Here we have one of the greatest directors alive (Steven Spielberg), a very big star (Tom Cruise) with a great ensemble (Max von Sydow, Colin Farrell, Peter Stormare, Samantha Morton, Tim Blake Nelson) around him, a good cinematography (Janusz Kaminski) and a nice score by John Williams all packed in a great story (based on the novel by Philip K. Dick) with perfect visual effects.",2003
9,"This is spoken in Minority Report by a drug-dealer on the streets with no eyes at all, so I suppose its free advice for John Anderton, our hero, or a bit of wise-sounding advice meant to get across to the audience but with no other good place for it to fit in the film. This is fine with me, too, because Minority Report is such a taut futuristic thriller that an incongruous little bit of wisdom like this is not to have any negative impact on the film as a whole. John Anderton, played with precision by the great Tom Cruise (oh shut up, the man's awesome), is the chief of the Pre-Crime department in the District of Columbia, which has successfully eradicated murder entirely for the last six years. He works with a group of `pre-cogs' that, together, dream of murders that have not yet taken place and project enough information for Anderton and his team to watch the video emanating from their heads to determine where and when the murders are to take place and to get to those locations and stop the murders from happening before they happen.

8,"The beginning of Minority Report engages the audience with mise en scene to establish a genre. The audience can easily see that the film is set in the future due to the bright lighting and a blue overlay colour. This implies cleanliness and a utopia. However due to the atmosphere created by the dark shadows and low saturation of the colours an implication is created that this futuristic world may not be a utopia but a dystopia. It gives a sense that without colour in the world there is no emotion and people actions are now based on what a machine says rather that acting on human instinct. In detective films in the present, the police station is often seen as a messy but friendly place with coffee mugs and paper everywhere. But in Minority Report the police station is empty; even the lights seem to dark and have no impact of the white surfaces. This may reflect Spielberg's views towards the future. That in fact the future may appear to be perfect but is actually the opposite.",2005

6,"This film is worth watching for lots of reasons. The best is Philip K. Dick's dystopian vision. And the acting is good too: Cruise as the high priest of pre-crime, catching murderers before they commit their offences using the mysterious power of the ""pre-cognitives""; Max Von Sydow adding his usual air of gravitas (how can Hollywood justify treating him so badly?)

His next two films were improvements (there was nowhere to go but up): the first anonymous but not bad (""Amistad""), the second bad but not anonymous (""Saving Private Ryan""), but they were both pompous gestures which appear to have been designed to win still more awards; and it wasn't until eight years after ""Schindler's List"" that the skilled director of old times re-appeared (with ""A.I."" in 2001).",2002

8,"This film has been unfairly judged! It is in fact a very good 80's style, Splatter, B-movie. It shys away from the self referencing humor plague that Scream started and succeeds in being a very strange splatter/comedy. Several reviews have been posted that say the characters are unlikable and do illogical things through the course of the movie. The characters are very good representations of the youth of the late 90's. The hunting squirrels joke is a perfect example. When asked why he is hunting the squirrels, the character replies, ""Cause their gay"". How many times have you heard a teen respond to a question in such a manner? Eli Roth has captured very well the essence of of being a teenager in this very cynical society.The actions the characters take are, in context, very believable. Ask yourself, if you were in a situation where you had to deal with the very likely possibility of becoming infected with a horrible flesh-eating disease, would you be the first to lend a helping hand to the infected? Another thing that has been trashed by many reviews is the strange sense of humor the film has. The pancakes scene in particular. The humor in the film is the strange sort you would more likely find in a Troma film (not the sex/toilet variety, though)While it's not for everyone, the sense of fun the movie has about itself is more suited to hardcore B-movie fans than mainstream audiences. Eli Roth hearkens back to a time when movies weren't always about psychological thrills,bad twist endings, and pretentious artistic ""meanings"", when they were about fun. It's a great movie to sit around with some friends and watch. So please, don't judge it so harshly, just because it's a movie to be taken straight with no shocking hidden meanings or twists. Hopefully this film will find it's audience with the cult movie crowd. Highly recommended to anyone with a love of B-Movie cinema.",2005

Next some of them start go get sick - must be something in the water at the cabin they are staying at. However the neighbors seem to be OK. Oh well, when things start getting really bad, they lock up one their companions instead of getting help (try the neighbor by the way). Some locals don't take a liking to them. They chase one on a high speed romp through the woods for many miles, until the truck breaks down. Somehow ten minutes later he shows up at the cabin (how he could find it and how he could travel at the speed of light to get there is a mystery). Another of the brain surgeon type at the cabin realizes something is amiss so he hides out in a cave to let this blow over. He then decides the next day to return to the cabin believing it must be some type of shrine. He is giddy with relief that he survived (he must have thought it was a 24 hour bug). Unfortuneatley he is met by some not so friendly police officers. Another couple decide to have sex while the flesh eating bug is working its magic, and then the women realizes she needs to shave her legs (taking a lot of the diseased skin with shaving cream).

A horror movie about five teenagers going to holiday in a cabin in the woods after college where the nearest town is filled with hicks and everything is slowly getting infected by an unknown virus which starts to turn everyone against each other. Roth blends horror with a small amount of comedy which suits this type of movie. ",2008
1,"I don't really know whether Cabin Fever is supposed to be a joke or a film... But as far as I know, it's much closer to being a joke than anything else. A few years ago, the community of horror film makers decided to take a new step and make fun of the genre, thus giving birth to the Scream series. A list was given in Scream, of all the stupid things horror film characters will do that are predictable, and the characters in Scream ended up doing exactly the same things, which added a lot of humor and irony to this analysis of the genre, and led to hope that horror films from now on would show a bit different, either full of irony towards the genre, self-derision towards the film itself, or at least different in their dramatic process than all the ""old"" films that responded to the same tired criteria. In seeing ""Cabin Fever"", alas, many will see how unoriginal, serious, pretentious, boring and even not scary some supposedly ""scary"" films are now, even a few years later. First of all, this film lacks originality in a way few others do. It has been said several times, how little imagination horror directors have today, remaking remakes of foreign sequels, but setting the film in a cabin in the woods just doesn't seem to be an ""hommage"" to anything, it seems to be, simply, a ripoff. Whoever wishes to be surprised by other factors of the film's story won't be: once again, we are dealing with a film whose characters are all in their early twenties, who won't think rationally when placed in front of a problem, will rather argue for hours and pick up fights than try to think and do something about it. Not much excitement there either. For the umpteenth time in a horror film, they are tempted to kiss, make love and just basically have fun, all sorts of things that don't really make them any different than any other horror film victims seen previously. Secondly, this film is unimaginatively serious. Every situation the characters are in, every dialog, every situation in the film is treated with such seriousness that any viewer with a little sense of derision will be relieved when some characters finally end up dying. Nothing in the way the film is directed, written or acted shows any sign of humor or sarcasm, which is quite amazing considering the film is about an invisible-never-heard-of-before-flesh-eating-virus (no laughs please). I won't even bring up the acting, since there are no actors in this film. The cast was most certainly hired for being friends or neighbors with the director. Thirdly, and this will strike whoever has seen a ""good"" horror film before, the screenplay is absolutely empty. Nothing really happens, some actions are repeated several times (""let's try to get help!""), nothing makes sense, either in the facts, the psychology of the characters, or even the hilariously lame last sequence of the film, which is probably supposed to be funny according to the director and screenwriters. In the end I will only remark that a horror film is supposed to have something scary in it. Gallons of fake blood, whether they are being vomited, squirted from severed limbs or simply dripping from wounds, never were enough to scare an audience. Such major features as screenplay, ideas, and even cruelty are requested for whoever claims to have shot something scary. If I wasn't considering it to be a total failure, I would agree to reckon that the film has one talent: it is filthy disgusting to watch. Yet being grossed-out and being scared are two very different feelings, let it be known.",2006
3,"Released in 2003, ""Cabin Fever"" was Eli Roth's film debut; he would go on to make the 2005 horror hit ""Hostel."" ""Cabin Fever"" has become somewhat of a modern cult film due to its eccentricities and Roth's later notoriety.",2014
7,"Cabin Fever was better than I expected but there were some things that weren't that good. For the most part the movie was a well made horror film that tells the story of five college friends on vacation at a remote mountain cabin when one of them contacts a flesh-eating virus. The movie is a somewhat realistic look at how people would react to such a situation. The movie stars Rider Strong (from Boy Meets World), Jordan Ladd (Broken Lizard Club Dread), Cierina Vincent (whose ""spolier"" featured in two steamy sex scenes one of which is good and another is okay at first then it gets weird. For those of you who have seen it. You know what I mean), James DeBello (from Detriot Rock City), Joey Kern, and the rest of the cast of unknowns are believable in their roles. I didn't really like the ending which could've been better and the dialogue wasn't the greatest at times but overall Cabin Fever is an effective horror thriller better than others that have come out recently from writer/director Eli Roth the man behind Hostel and Hostel Part 2 which at least to me weren't as good as this one. So if you're in the mood for a decent horror thriller you can go wrong with Cabin Fever. It (for the most part) delivers on whats expected from these kind of movies.",2009

2,"Something i've noticed over the past decade or more (and these days most of all)is the horror film maker's attempt to include too many elements of the action and comedy genres in an attempt to appeal to a bigger audience.  If I want a comedy, I'll go see a comedy.  I don't mind a little comic relief and I love dark humor when it is done in a subtle and meaningful manner.  I like a horror film that just beats the living hell outta me.  I want to come out of the theater truly shaken and effected.  Cabin Fever is played too much for laughs and the jokes just aren't that funny.  Just kinda stupid and pointless.  I found myself too often annoyed at characters like Party Cop, Grim and The Karate Kid who just had nothing to do with anything.  I've not seen as pointless a character as Grim since a real turd of a movie called Scared Stiff.  He's there to supply a crazy dog and a dead body to stumble over at the end of the movie.  I keep hearing that horror audiences want the humor these days and it is fairly apparent that this is true but if this is what they want, then aren't they missing the point of a horror movie?  I dunno.  I give this thing good marks for it's excellent and effective gore make-up and the little bit of tension that it did have, but too many things about it made no sense and didn't need to be there.  I've never walked out on a movie in my life.  No matter how bad it was.  But I came damn close with this one.  The last 10 or 15 minutes were pretty hard to sit through. Just got more and more ridiculous.  I find myself wondering about the rabbit suit guy in the hospital.  Was this a clumsy attempt at a metaphor for the guy in the beginning of the movie who was apparently hunting rabbits?  Was his dog supposed to have gotten the virus from eating an infected rabbit? Wasn't really made clear, so the rabbit suit guy seemed rather pointless. Just got another ""huh?"" outta me.  Maybe the rabbit escaped from an animal research lab up-river from the cabin, huh?  There.  I'll just fill in all the holes with my own story.  Then maybe this film won't hurt so much. Matter of fact, watching this thing actually gave me a head-ache that lasted 6 hours. Only 2 aleve got rid of this movies residue.  So...to sum up...too many stupid jokes.  Not scary enough.  And just bad film making in general. There.  I feel better.",2003

2,"although this film had gory scenes it still remained that it was another pointless attempt to gross people out and have a bit of sex in it the plot was very very thin... the actors didn't light up the screen and i found myself praying for the next one to die... i feel asleep twice through sheer boredom and even after the third time watching it failed 2 see the significance of film it seemed like yet another long winded pointless horror that wasn't scary and looked more like a comedy with the added bonus of some blood and gore... i wouldn't recommend this film 2 anyone who want a good time, i think you'll find its quite annoying really",2006
4,"Cabin Fever offers some intense and scary moments but its really just the same except not very memorable. As a last hurrah after college, friends Jeff, Karen, Paul, Marcy and Bert embark on a vacation deep into the mountains. They drive to a remote cabin to enjoy their last days of decadence before entering the working world. Then their friend Karen gets sick and to avoid catching her virus they lock her in a shed. They look at one another and realize that any one of them could also have it. What soon began as a struggle against the disease turns into a battle against friends, as the fear of contagion drives them to turn on each other. The kids confront the terror of having to kill anyone who comes near them, even if it's their closest friend. The plot sure does sound scary and they did a decent job of executing it. I had heard that this film was really scary and I guess I did have high expectations. I should have lowered them as this was a slightly above average horror flick and nothing more. The story was decent with some clever twists and then it also had some old, annoying clichés. The acting was alright with the best being Rider Strong. His performance was nothing special but he stood out from everyone else. The rest of the kids are played by Jordan Ladd, James DeBello, Joey Kern and Cerina Vincent. They all play their roles well but don't really have a big impact on the viewer, which is okay since this is just a teenage horror flick. Eli Roth did an okay job of directing but he isn't that great at building suspense. I thought the film got really stupid at times like the kid who liked pancakes. I guess the director was making a reference to some film but it wasn't really needed. There were a lot of plot holes as well like who was the pancake kid? The film is pretty gory not over the top but enough to satisfy people. Cabin Fever pays homage to older horror classics which is nice but I didn't really think that helped the quality of the picture. In the end, this is a decent horror flick that's worth checking out. Rating 6/10",2005

1,"If I wanted to rent a movie with lots of sex and cuss words in it I would have rented a porno. This movie was a terrible example of horror. I was disgusted by the way it had mostly gore and sex, but lacked the horror essential. I'm sure that the boys will like this film, especially the single ones who are very hormonal. But when you want a scare this is not for you. This is just as bad as House of 1000 corpses and The Village. I can't believe that the director allowed this to be filmed. Don't they watch these things before they make it to view in theaters. Rider Strong is lucky to be cute other wise I wouldn't have continued to watch it. If you want to fall asleep watch this then the Libertine. Waste of money personally. one of the 100 greatest horror movies, yeah right!",2006
2,"Cabin fever is one of the worst movies I've seen. For a start, the acting is no good, unreal, without attitude and so bad it's not even funny. The story comes without structure, totally predictable, the writing is very unnatural, the characters act in a very incoherent way, there's a lot of make-up involved pretending to gross out the audience but that can't save a bad movie. Like always, there are some good things: like the weirdness of characters or some scenes that are unexplainable but funny. But 2 or 3 good elements can't help 100 mistakes. I think Cabin Fever wants to be a bizarre horror movie, but it's not bizarre, just stupid. Nudity, sex, violence, blood and diseases, the magic ingredients for a boring movie....oh! and don't forget the furious dog, that's the climax. I read other comments of people who found it great; I respect all opinions, but, my advise, you'll get more fun, learn more and have a better time taking the fleas of your dog... trust me.",2006

6,"It seems as though there is no way to dispel negative atmosphere once it has been started. George Lucas's STAR WARS trilogy was well-loved by audiences (even though critics were split) but for some reason (and I can't figure it out), the first entry in the prequels, THE PHANTOM MENACE, earned a HUGE onslaught of critically divided posts just about everywhere in the world, from the press to the internet to fans in real life. While I do agree that the original trilogy is a tough act to follow, I wasn't as grossly let down by this movie as some were.",2005
10,"I happen to be one of the folks who really has enjoyed these films in the prequel trilogy.  I also can see why people would not like the films and I don't deny people the right to their opinion.  What has been bothering me has been some of the reasons people are giving for hating these new films... they are childish, they have too many special-effects, the acting is bad, the writing is bad, Lucas has sold out and has lost his touch... it makes me wonder if people are actually remembering the original trilogy correctly. Don't get me wrong, I love the original trilogy, but they weren't exactly well-acted or well-written movies.  We didn't love them because they were these great Shakespearian works of art; we loved them because we were little kids totally enraptured by this exciting fantastical world.  It seems that those same kids that loved the films 20 years ago have grown up into stuffy old yuppies that have no idea how to have fun anymore.  Our generation has grown up and it seems that we wanted Star Wars to grow up with us, to morph into some new R-rated grown up version to satisfy our more mature needs. Well, we didn't like the original trilogy because it was all grown up and serious.  We liked it because it was silly and fun and awesome to look at. I am personally glad that George Lucas did not make the prequels into a new grown up version.  I like the adventure and excitement and I challenge the one major complaint that says that they do not live up to the originals. Let's look at what people have complained about when comparing these to the original trilogy.",2003
1,"First off, don't blame the actors or the special effects. It's not their fault. Whenever someone knocks a bad movie, which Episode II qualifies as, they immediately raise the pitchforks towards the actors. If your going to lay some blame, lay it at the feet of George Lucas. It was his puerile script that brought the actors to their knees, and his lack of direction that made them stay there. It was George's unholy fascination with all things digital that massacred the screen with billions of wasted pixilated images, making the flesh and blood actors seem like they stepped into the Twilight Zone.",2002
8,"This episode of the Star wars saga was criticized by some when it came out for having wooden dialogue and too much digital landscaping to be any good. I wasn't overly impressed with it myself, but having seen all 6 films now, AOTC is actually a very important and well done section of the overall series.",2005
7,"*WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* If you remember, I was one of the few who did not hate The Phantom Menace, in fact, I gave it a positive rating. If you'd like to get a different opinion on the prequels, please be sure and check that review out as well, but now, let's talk about The Attack of The Clones. This movie has a few rough spots, Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman don't have very good chemistry together, despite both of them giving decent performances in the rest of the movie. No, Hayden Christensen isn't that bad, he's a bit wooden, but I think he plays a believable confused young man who has been isolated all his life. In fact, I think that most of the hate surrounding Christensen is less about how he plays his role, and more about what role he's playing. People don't want Vader to be a bitter and over- reacting teenager, but in the scenes where Christensen is able to show who he'll become, he's great. Besides, this is all about how Anakin becomes Vader, he can't start out as Vader in Episode II. The movie also gets heat for other stuff, too boring, too much CGI, etc. The CGI effects look great, it makes it look like a more advanced culture, by having surroundings that we can't yet physically create. Now, maybe a few practical effects wouldn't have been amiss, but I think the use of CGI is a relatively minor complaint, and one that doesn't really effect the over-all quality of the film. The plot may be slow at times, but don't forget, we have lots of action in here as well. A full scale battle at the end, a high speed chase through Courscant, a duel between Obi-Wan and Jango Fett, etc. Yes there are slow stretches, but there are also plenty of scenes that are really fun. I know Yoda fighting with a light-saber, you know, a Jedi's weapon, is supposed to be just like heresy or something, but I can't take that complaint seriously. How else would Yoda have fought? With a stick? It's not like he doesn't use the force or anything! But enough with the negatives, let's talk about why this movie is genuinely good. Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan is great! He brings the right level of sophistication and intelligence to the character, while still managing to seem like a less experienced version of the character in A New Hope. Jango Fett is a really good villain, he brings in great action and is just over all a really cool character. I already said I like Hayden Christensen, who I think accurately displays youth, and provides a relate-able character for everyone who's ever been a teenager ever. The action is top-notch as well. The speeder chase on Courscant is a great start to the movie; humor, good effects, and very fast-paced. The finale is very well done also, and it's a blast to see the first full scale battle in a Star Wars movie (the gungans don't count). The story, thought admittedly a bit muddled, is interesting enough (let's be honest, Star Wars isn't story based, it is driven by characters and action). I understand very few will agree with this review, but I wanted to give my own opinion on the Star Wars movies, so, I started reviewing them. I'll try to have my Revenge of the Sith review up soon!",2015

1,"This is a film that took three of the most beloved films of all time and sold their souls to CGI. The original Star Wars Trilogy were not labelled as the greatest films ever made because of Light Sabres, or Storm Troopers, or groundbreaking motion capture special effects, but because of the human side. The quality of the acting from Sir Alec Guinness, the chemistry between Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher, the excellent dialogue that made every line a memorable quote and the context of faith and religion are what made them so everlasting. In this film Ewan McGregor's acting is surprisingly wooden for such a talented actor, Hayden Christensen has less chemistry with Natalie Portman than a 12 year old student's test tube, the dialogue is boring, the lines are cheesy and clichéd, there does not seem to be any actual emphasis on plot, it just being an excuse to glue one over-long action set piece to another, so the intrigue disappears fast and the themes and contexts are given a back seat to (admittedly impressive) CGI.

My friend recommended Episode 2 to me, telling me that it was better than its predecessor, but warning me ""don't see it if you expect anything more than a Star Wars movie."" Maybe I just have a nostalgic love for the first trilogy, but I would never think that they were anywhere near as poor, in any way, as this new garbage. I can't think of a high budget movie that I've seen that has such bad directing, bad acting, bad casting, bad special effects (or lack thereof), bad music, bad dialogue and bad plot, as ATTACK OF THE CLONES (bad title too).  The reviewers on this site giving this movie positive reviews must all be brainwashed.

On the arrival, she escapes from an attempt to kill her and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and his Padawan Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) are assigned to protect her. They chase the shape-shifter Zam Wessell (Leeanna Walsman) but she is killed by a poisoned dart before revealing the identity of who hired her. The Jedi Council assigns Obi-Wan Kenobi to discover the bounty hunter that has tried to kill Amidala and Anakin to protect her in Naboo. Obi-Wan discovers that the dart is from the planet Karmino and he heads to the remote planet. He finds an army of clones that has been under production for years for the Republic and that the bounty hunter Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison) was the matrix for the clones. Meanwhile Anakin and Amidala fall in love with each other and he has nightmares with his mother. They travel to his planet Tattoine to see his mother and he discovers that she has been abducted by the evil Tusken Raiders. Anakin finds his mother dying and he kills all the Tusken tribe including the women. Obi-Wan follows Jango Fett to the planet Geonosis where he finds who is behind the Separatist movement.

1,"I gave this film 1 out of 10 because it is honestly one of the worst films I have ever seen. *****SPOILERS***** The log-fire scene where Anakin Skywalker woodenly tells Natalie Portman about his intense ""pain"" and ""suffering"" was fortunately drowned out by the sound of the entire audience failing to suppress their giggles and guffaws. We know how you feel, Anakin. Am I the only one who thought this was actually worse than the Phantom Menace? I don't remember anything about the plot of that film but I remember feeling mildly entertained. This was just plain boring. From the high-speed chase in the city to the weird tall thin aliens to the political assassination attempt it all felt like a TV spin-off of the Fifth Element without the famous actors, the beautiful models, the slick direction, the humour, the dialogue or the fun. The waterfalls in the background on Naboo looked like the tongue-in-cheek idyllic backdrop on a Kraftwerk CD. The gladiatorial scene was straight out of your first Dungeons & Dragons game. The big battle at the end was SO BORING people were leaving their seats and returning ten minutes later... they'd probably gone outside for a cigarette. The acting and the dialogue would, by and large, not have passed muster on a Mexican soap opera; the most interesting part of Natalie Portman's performance was the surprise appearance of her nipples. On the plus side: Yoda drew some genuine laughs with his ""kung fu"" stance, although high-speed Yoda was a bit too fanciful for my liking. Ewan McGregor's effort was good considering the material, and his fight with Jango Fett should put him in the running for a role as 007. But what this franchise really needs to do is bring back Harrison Ford... perhaps Han Solo was a clone?",2002
8,"Star Wars Episode II: Attack Of The Clones is the eagerly anticipated sequel to Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. After three years since the original let-down, we find out that this one won't include Jar Jar Binks as a central character, or won't have an irritating ten year old who'll play Anakin Skywalker, we even see a glimpse of what could be everyone's favorite bounty hunter, Boba Fett! We all reassure ourselves that Star Wars would get better now, and stay true to that classic style we all cherished. But the same thing with The Phantom Menace occurred again, most fans didn't like the movie for reasons we'll explain throughout this review. This movie, like The Phantom Menace suffers from a bad script, though not as bad as The Phantom Menace's. Firstly the dialog between Obi Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker in the elevator scene at the start of the film. It's a nice little bit where the two exchange words about their previous adventures together and show a friendship. Though we as an audience don't know what they're talking about because we haven't seen those adventures. George Lucas can't just simply explain to us that in that one minute scene that they're friends, you have to show it in the actual movie, like they did with the Lethal Weapon franchise. Like when Martin Riggs reminds Roger about the time he was stuck to a toilet in case a bomb went off in part 2, the two smile remembering that bizarre moment and we as an audience remember it too, relating to the friendship. Here the script takes one short scene in an elevator to tell us that the two are friends because... They were meant to be good friends according to Obi Wan's story to Luke in Episode IV. Then for the rest of the movie they do there own separate things showing concentration in the wrong area. Obi Wan's off finding this Clone Army on the planet Kamino and Anakin's on Naboo protecting Padme from an assassination. Now people criticize the film for Anakin's (Hayden Christensen's) acting performance in the film, but this is a false claim. The actor does very well if the right script is given to him, the bad acting is a result of poor direction by George Lucas. For some reason the love story dialog between Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman) and Anakin is so horrible because... Of the way Hayden Christensen says the lines!? Almost every character in this movie has to say stupid lines too, why does all the critique come down upon Hayden!? Although Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan makes his lines sound much better, seeing that he is in fact a better actor. Now another reason why everyone dislikes this movie is in fact for the love story, they say it's awkward and forced but we say it's beautiful though very clichéd. There really is no problem with the love story other than it's clichéd as hell, and that great John Williams score doesn't help either! But with all the beautiful backdrops and locations, who cares, we think it's perfect how Anakin and Padme fall in love. The movie also uses too much CGI, but it makes for some thrilling action scenes, this movie has he best actions scenes out of the whole entire saga. It's got the Bounty Hunter chase through Coruscant, Obi Wan VS Jango Fett, the Jedi Battlle in that arena, the beginning of the Clone Wars, and Yoda's epic light saber duel. Although Yoda having a light saber totally clashes with everything he stands for in Episode V, it's still pretty cool to see him whipping out and wielding his very own light saber. Then Jango Fett, the father of Boba is also a very cool addition to the Star Wars Saga, we maybe even prefer him to Boba, just for his awesome battle with Mace Windu on Geonosis. It is also interesting to see Chancellor Palpatine take his first step into becoming the Emperor in one of the ending scenes, as he controls the Clone Army. Another great thing about the film is Anthony Daniels as C-3PO, back in his old comic self again. But another major flaw is the brief relationship between Anakin and Owen Lars. At the end of Revenge of the Sith he receives the child of his stepbrother (Anakin) from a guy he didn't even know (Obi Wan). Anyway, comparing these positives, Attack of the Clones is a thrilling space adventure film featuring new awesome planets we love like Kamino and Geonosis. It pushes the action to new heights, and is our personal favorite of the saga, making it number one. Though for some reason George Lucas writes Anakin as a bad apple. Anakin is not much like Luke Skywalker at all, for he is not totally being a good guy in this film, this is seen after his mothers death when he mindlessly slaughters countless Tusken Raiders. And when he attempts to run at the movies' villain with a light saber with hate and anger! Though there are some scenes where he's kind-hearted, most of it is just him being arrogant, but this doesn't really bother us. Another great thing about the film is Count Dooku, he makes the film very enjoyable but the slightly UN-EVEN pacing of the film makes him enter a full hour in! Episode II is an epic story that goes in depth at the look of how the death of Anakin's mother will influence his fall to the dark side and how his love for Padme will cross a forbidden Jedi rule. The only thing wrong with this film, that bugs us enough to point out is the relationship between Obi Wan and Anakin, which should have been expanded. Nonetheless Episode II is the strongest of the saga but suffers from an onslaught of under-ration by fans just because of a few reasons they that can't even explain...",2015

10,"George Lucas has finally done it. He has made a movie for the fans. This ranks as high as my favorite Empire Strikes Back in someways better. I love the themes, the music the plot. A very eree parallel to the same series of events and similar circumstances Luke went through however Anakin is having it a lot worse than Luke did in my opinion. This new kid Hayden Christensen was perfect for Anakin. He played a very convincing person I could forsee becoming Darth Vader. He better be in Episode 3. And Natalie Portman, she gets more and more beautiful in every movie. Ewan McGregor is the best Obi Wan Kenobi. I hope that the actor playing Jango returns as Boba Fett (with some growth acceleration) for Episode 3. This movie was such an excellent parallel to Empire Strikes Back. Episode 1 paralleled A New Hope, kind of their own establishing movies that weren't that in depth. You know they are going to parallel Episode 3 with Return of the Jedi, I forsee Anakin fighting and slaying Dooku taking his place at Palpatine's side.",2002
1,"The fundamental flaws in Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones are pretty much summed up in a single scene in this film. Anakin Skywalker and Padme Amidala are sitting at a dinner table (?), and decide to share a piece of fruit. And during this entire scene, the piece of fruit is completely computer generated, and it shows. It's horribly obvious when Anakin slices it in half, and becomes downright inexcusable when Padme takes a bite of it. We can see the actors are just miming the motions.

1,"I was extremely excited about seeing Episode II, especially since Lucas promised a ""dark"" episode reminiscent of Empire.  Wow, I thought, we could really use a dark episode.  Since Jedi and Phantom Menace were clearly aimed more towards children (in my opinion) rather than the original Star Wars faithful, both had warm and fuzzy endings (and in some cases, characters too).  Well, ""dark"" wouldn't be an adjective that I would use to describe this movie at all.  How about ""hardly dingy"" instead?  I mean, the bad guys just weren't very bad.  I may be mistaken, but I only remember seeing Darth Sidius in costume one time.  If he did appear twice, he obviously didn't leave much of an impression on me, which only proves my point.  Now come on, EVERYONE remembers all of Darth Vader's and Darth Maul's scenes, right? To me, Darth Tyranus actually comes off as a decent guy for most of the movie.",2002
10,"This is a compelling and oddly comforting drama. There is the setting and the time -- Hastings, on the southern coast of England during World War II. Hastings of course was the site of the last successful invasion of England, in 1066, and that threat seems real in the early days of the war. In the series, it is a provincial town where Deputy Chief Superintendent Foyle tries to solve local crimes of theft and murder, while dealing with wartime problems of black markets, sabotage and espionage. In addition to meddling from police superiors with their own agendas, Foyle must contend with bureaucratic and military interference from London as the war creates situations that lets criminals go free.",2007

9,"Michael Kitchen absolutely shines in this fine series; it is about moral dilemmas rather than crime. Kitchen's characterisation of a fearless good man in hard times is magnificent; we know we can trust exactly what he says and even if some of his solutions are a bit deus ex machina we cannot resent it because his moral force absolutely justifies the end. The other actors do a great job of presenting the shades of grey through which he moves. My favourite is still Simon West. Who can resist Kitchen's throwaway response to ""It's not a good time""? And his magnificently insulting summing up in the French Drop? I know little enough about the Home Front around this period, and that I learnt from Dad's Army! But the muted colours and all the obscure minutiae of a rationed and regulated society provide a feeling that this is how it was, even if it wasn't.",2007
10,"Foyle's War is unique in it's blending of history and fiction. I just finished watching a special feature that filmed the stunt preparation for a spitfire crash in ""Enemy Fire"". I am amazed at the thought and detail that go into making these films.",2007
10,"The most derogatory remark I've ever heard an intelligent people make about this program is that it drags on a bit, but quite frankly that's only because ITV go and stick 25 minutes of adverts into a otherwise perfect fluid 95minute program. I suppose you could argue that the sheer lack of offended and dishearten viewers is testament to its boring nature, but that quite frankly is nonsense as well. You see the thing about this program is that it soothes you, it's relaxing to watch but doesn't insult your intelligence. I could go on for pages and pages about the acting, writing and attention to period detail but I won't bother because by the looks of it many before me have done so already. The two simple and only facts you really need to know about this program are that Kitchen is an underrated genius and that as detective/murder mysteries go this is, and will remain, a timeless masterpiece.",2006
10,"There is really nothing with which to compare this episodic series. The pacing, the acting, and the plots blend to create a superb fictional experience. I find very, very little to like in today's movies (No Country for Old Men being an exception) and much more to like on television, which I understand his heresy to some, but Six Feet Under, Doctor Findlay, Morse, Midsomer Murders, The Shield etc. far surpass any movie I've seen in a long time. This show in particular shows what can be done in cinema but not in writing--very, very unique. Seeing Foyle, his driver and his immediate subordinate act their parts really helps make this a fine viewing experience. Kitchen, playing the lead, is a fine actor and performs admirably, but the writing is what makes this show--Horowitz, the writer and creator, never varies from show to show. He controls the unfolding of this show, without the viewer having to worry about different writers muddling the waters. I highly recommend this show and would urge viewers to watch the series sequentially, starting, of course with the first episode.",2009
10,"My wife and I became obsessed with the British crime series ""Midsomer Murders"". We've seen all the episodes available. Then my wife latched onto ""Foyle's War"" and we've become big, big fans of this series also. We agree with everyone about Michael Kitchen's performances and the historical background against which the story unfolds. Everything about this show looks authentic, feels authentic and sounds authentic. Not having lived through that time we are learning so much about the period. We're beginning to learn more about just exactly what England went through during the war by connecting some of these events in a time line. We are looking forward to the possible three new episodes to be filmed in the spring of '09. And we wouldn't mind if the series went on for longer than the war lasted. We let ""M*A*S*H"" get away with it. This is one series that deserves to be on longer.",2009
9,Michael Kitchen is simply outstanding -- there is no other word for it.,2006
10,"Personally, I find Foyle's War very well done for a war time series and a police series for that matter. I also like the characters' personalities. Foyle does not use foul language nor does he raise his voice along with other main characters. Sam's character is actually uplifting as a chauffeur and her being helpful to Foyle. For most police series I rather watch British series such as Foyle's War, Midsomer Murders, New Tricks, Rosemary & Thyme, A Touch Of Frost, etc. rather than those hyper tension ones that American networks are bringing out.",2006
6,I came across this quite by accident and tuned in on a very interesting episode entitled: FOYLE'S WAR II: The Fifty Ships. Very understated but impressive performance by Michael Kitchen as the inspector who looks into the murder of an Englishman in a picturesque London village during World War II.,2007
7,"I was an early fan of Foyle's War, especially Michael Kitchen's portrayal of the title character, which is a master class in fine nuance and understatement. The way Kitchen can convey a wealth of meaning with the slightest glance or change in tone when speaking is wonderful to watch. It's almost as if he was born to play this character. Also, the whole concept of police work having to continue as normally as possible in a time of war is intriguing. In many ways, the job would have been so much harder with the backdrop of war and the resultant shortage of resources and increase in disruption. It was a fine idea from the start. Having said that, I found as the series went on and I began to review earlier episodes that something about it had begun to irritate me, and I eventually realised that it was the way in which most of the other characters - apart from Foyle's own inner circle - were portrayed as uniformly negative. Granted, this is a crime and murder-mystery series, so Foyle is dealing primarily with criminals and red-herring characters. But sometimes, it seems as though the writer Anthony Horowitz wants us to believe everyone in wartime Britain was either rotten to the core or afflicted with moral cowardice. No doubt not everyone displayed the ""bulldog spirit"" that got the nation through those difficult years - every country at war has its share of defeatists, shirkers and traitors - but Horowitz seemed unwilling to allow that positive determined quality in any of his ""guest"" characters, whether major or minor in the story. This is especially true of anyone in a position of authority. Just about every single person that Foyle deals with who holds rank or official status is portrayed in varying degrees as arrogant, callous, treacherous, obstructive or incompetent - sometimes a combination of these. It's as though Horowitz wants us to think that either Britain's entire wartime leadership was working against its own national interests or that there was never a sense of righteousness in the fight against Nazism. Foyle's War sometimes seemed to be against his own government and his own superiors. On the odd occasion this might have been a useful plot device, but was it necessary for it to be such a constant theme? I can't help wondering what the motive was for this, but I do know that over time it began to spoil my enjoyment of the show.",2015
10,"For as long as I can remember, I have been fascinated by detective dramas. Having grown up with Inspector Morse, Touch of Frost, Taggart and Midsommer Murders, as well as the Agatha Christie adaptations with Joan Hickson and David Suchet(I also enjoy New Tricks, no matter how corny some of it is, it is entertaining), I first heard about this series two years ago. Since then, I have been hooked, I admit it was a little hard to get into at first, but I love the acting and how much visual detail goes into the series. The series really does look amazing, set during the 2nd World War, with beautiful costumes, pretty locations and authentic-looking scenery. The scripts are intelligent, sophisticated and absorbing as you would expect from a talented writer like Anthony Horowitz, and I will say I loved the concept, solving crimes amidst the backdrop of the war, not a bad idea now, is it? And of course, the acting is wonderful, with Michael Kitchen superb as Christopher Foyle, subtle, intense determined and most of all human who asks himself questions that only he can answer. Morse was quite a complex detective as well, more complex than he was in the books I'd say, but he was complex in a different sort of way to Foyle. Anthony Howell is also great as Sergeant Milner, as is the beautiful Honeysuckle Weeks as Sam. Also, the stories are intriguing and multi-layered, yes there may be the odd occasion where a plot point mayn't completely make sense first time, but this is only occasionally. Overall, a truly excellent series, where would we be without it? 10/10 Bethany Cox",2010
9,"Positively the worst and most misleading summary I have yet seen on IMDb! (Unless I have been completely hoodwinked - I was born just after the war!) According to my knowledge gleaned from various sources and what I have been told over the years, there may have been concerns at the individual level, but there was certainly no mass terror or hysteria displayed as a result of bombings or the prospect of an invasion of the UK, during the darkest days of WW2!",2008
8,"The main advantage of this series is that it not only gives us a vivid description of life in Britain during World War 2 but also adds all the ingredients that are inherent to good detective stories. The threat of a possible German invasion obviously had an enormous impact on the inhabitants and these aspects are often discarded in many historical accounts of this tragic period. ""Foyle's War"" concentrates on what really went on in the average person's mind and does not avoid revealing the darker side of human nature in general. Themes such as the undeniable sympathy for Hitler and Nazi Germany that existed in certain aristocratic circles, the growing hatred towards refugees and Jews, the plight of young children who were sent to the countryside in order to avoid the bombings in the major cities and were often worse off than had they stayed with their parents, are touchy subjects which are not avoided in a series that certainly aims at painting a truthful picture. Most episodes are very slow paced as if to illustrate how insignificant a crime committed by an individual basically is compared to the imminent danger of the destruction of a whole nation. This atmosphere of gloom and doom often leads the protagonists to reflect profoundly on the meaning of war and life in general which gives the series an extra dimension.The acting is exquisite and contributes largely to the sense of contained despair that many must have experienced at that time in history.",2006
10,"I've never met the reviewer, Theo Robertson, but I hope I never do. I really dislike people popping off about things of which they know so little. Oswald Mosley was both a fascist, hoping to brand his New Party after Mussolini, and a personal friend of Joseph Goebbels( yes, that Joseph Goebbels). Upon the secretive circumstances of Mosley's second marriage it was conducted at Goebbel's private residence in Berlin. One of the guests was Adolph Hitler. ",2014
9,"I gave this series a nine. But it borders on a ten. When I began in episode one of the first season, I was not sure. It seemed depressing and the character D.C.S Foyle seemed unemotional, cold, and hard to warm up to. As I continued in the series, Foyle did not change much, but I adapted and began to truly appreciate the work that went into creating feature-length episodes with intriguing plots and subplots. There is genius in the writing, producing, and acting. The sets and period equipment are very well done and seem very consistent.",2013
10,"I've never seen a better show on television. Granted, if I were in my twenties, I'd be bored to tears. Now, however, I've already seen 10,000 American cop shows. I won't criticize them, after all I watched the ones I enjoyed for a long time. They are what they are, by now each show must contain a certain number of spreadsheet elements to appeal to the largest market in its time period. Men handsome, women thin, good story, great clothes, good story-up to 2.7 stories, that is 1 main story and an average of 1.7 additional plot lines for gays, seniors, teenagers, ethnics, or anyone outside the main story. ""Foyle's War"" is deep, thoughtful television art. Great premise. Acting is tremendous. Only the bad guys overact. To see the characters is to love them. Sets and details have been discussed at length and it's all just gorgeous.It may offend some American sensibilities at times, as it is the British perspective of the war, not the ""universal perspective"" we think is gospel. Each episode is like a movie. Not a show to be enjoyed with children around. Attention must be paid. Catch an episode on PBS. Take out a couple at the library, then buy a whole season so such art is supported financially. So I say.",2011

10,"The Shield is not for everyone. My wife, for instance does not like violent TV shows. The Shield is raw, violent and full of incredible suspense and intrigue. A good friend of mine recently turned me on to the Shield and I will forever be grateful. I travel quite a lot and watched all 100+ hours of the Shield while on the road. I could not wait to get to the next episode. During a recent 2 week trip to India, I did not turn on the TV one time. I watched a episode or two of The Shield every night and a whole season each way on the plane. There is a lot of debate about the ending, which I thought was perfect. It's difficult to end such an epic saga but these guys did it about as good as you can. The Shield is life changing. Not all for the good.You should be prepared to be affected by this thing. It's gritty but in the same way that A Clockwork Orange is gritty. The difference is that this lasts for a long, delicious time.",2009

10,"The shield is one of the best cop shows of all time, only behind ""The Wire."" The story line is rich and the cast is just brilliant. Michael Chiklis had a career defining role as the brutal Vic Mackey. Chiklis is so good that somehow you continue to root for the guy after all of the brutal crimes he has committed. He truly played that role to perfection. The show continues to get better as the seasons progress. They build on each other perfectly which sets up the epic and heart-wrenching series finale. ",2010
9,"I only heard of The Shield a few weeks ago. I had only just finished watching a previous TV show from start to finish, and was after a new one to pass the time. I typed in ""The Best TV Shows Ever"", or something similar, on Google, and I noticed that this was on a few lists. I'd never heard of it, but after checking to see that it was given a very respectable 8.7 rating on IMDb, I decided to check it out.",2012
10,"The Shield in my opinion as it is in most people's view, is probably regarded as second to The Wire as one of the greatest shows on television. The Shield is not just a cop show either, just like The Wire. With The Shield, you see politics, family issues, sexuality, and many other hard hitting topics that The Wire covers also but in two separate environments; Baltimore and Los Angeles. I was lucky enough to have bought the entire season 1 - 7 of The Shield on DVD at a good price, and slowly made my way through the vice and darkness that surrounds the show and its characters.",2010
10,"it's been a long time, since I've been posting on IMDb.. but this show is absolutely worth watching. ",2009
10,"I have all the seasons in DVD box sets and they're worth every penny. Few TV shows are able to maintain an excellent level of writing, acting and direction. ABC's Once & Again did that successfully for 3 years and The Shield has done it for 5 years and is still going. New shows come and go but, few live up to a series like this. No cliché lines. No over explaining every thing to you like you're an idiot (i.e. C.S.I.). No clear good guy / bad guy. Everyone is human. The action is there, the suspense is there, they shoot it as if you are there. Vic Mackey and his strike team are a force for the gangs of Farmington to contend with. But, sometimes the cops find themselves on the wrong side of a gun.",2006
10,I think the Shield is excellent and has a huge fan base in the UK. In my opinion it's up there with the Sopranos as the best thing on TV certainly in the UK. Obviously I can't comment on US television. I love the documentary style of filming and can't get enough of the whole thing. It's just a shame that we have to wait so long to see the new series here as we are well behind you in the US. I usually buy them on DVD to save waiting. I really can't believe anyone being critical of this show. You should see some of the stuff that's broadcast in England if you want to see rubbish. The Shield really is top class and long may it continue.,2006

10,"I haven't watched many TV shows ever since The Shield ended, and never again with the same devotion and lack of critical attitude. After The Shield, I just couldn't go back to watching problem-of-the-week type of shows, whether it be super-duper, morally perfect policemen solving a crime every episode (CSI, Criminal Minds, The Mentalist, et cetera), or some young reluctant hero killing monsters (Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Supernatural, et cetera). I became used to long-term plotting, dynamic characters constantly changing, complex narratives developing organically, and incisive critiques of society, race, sexuality, power, politics, family relationships, and more, much more. Yes, I even became used to bleakness, a lot of pessimism and a refusal to offer viewers simple solutions to complex problems. In this sense, The Shield is less a conventional TV show and more a novel in visual form, a long story, carefully plotted, full of meditations and insights into human nature, and a mirror to our times.",2012

I was even MORE shocked when I realized why Everwood was dumped...because CW is bring back the highly publicized 7th Heaven after their 10th and FINAL season. This was such heart-breaking news.,2006

I thought it was great, and two weeks later, bought the first season on DVD. Now I'm back at college, I can't watch it anymore, and I miss it so much. It's such a feel-good program. It's funny without being obvious and the characters in it are great - they are very wheel developed right from the beginning, and very believable. I just wish the other seasons were out on DVD, for those of us who don't have the chance to see it at any other time.

10,"In a time of Reality shows that are truly made up competitions, Everwood shows the real way life works. It isn't full of ""free love"" or horrid language, but shows how people can change and how sometimes the hardest part of change is allowing it to happen. As the characters often found themselves longing for the past they had to realize that their lives were no longer there, and if a happier future is what they wanted they had to move on when what they were after was gone. And sadly, the network that was airing this wonderful show moved on too soon. There is a difference of moving on when the time has come and moving on when it is too early. One is making peace with the past and the other is shutting the door so that you MIGHT not get hurt. Taking chances is what life is about. Taking chances is what Everwood is about. It seems that the network that was airing it has learned nothing.",2006

Why or why do I get attached to a concept, story line, buy into the excellent cast...only to get disappointed time after time when quality shows like Everwood get the ax...and stupid reality shows reign supreme? What a shame. I hope that at least they will finish out printing the DVD collection for all the years so avid fans like myself can buy them, and show them to kids later so they can too see that quality did exist somewhere on TV. I hope this talented cast will go on to do a lot for them in future undertakings. Treat Williams of course will, but Tom Amandes, Gregory Smith and Emily VanCamp should also get some excellent roles from this venue.

AWTR contains a heartfelt conclusion to a story where you get to care about Landon and Jamie, two polar opposite teenagers who face peer struggles and the perils of love and death. The situations that occur are very real, and very sad. Once the movie finishes, you'll be left wondering what happens to everyone (heck, even though it doesn't make sense, I want a sequel!).",2004

Its few ""cons"" are totally overpowered by the sheer wonder and sincerity of this remarkable film, perhaps one of the best ever emanating from Hollywood and Warner Brothers – a monumental feat given its small production budget. The subtle power of this film keeps one thinking about it continuously and wanting to see it multiple times. It's a wonderful story about growing up and how one special person can change you forever. It shows how deeply loving someone can transform you to gain the strength to forgive, to accept, to respect, and to accomplish that which you heretofore would never consider. This movie conveys what true love really is, how it can affect people in life and death, and how absolutely beautiful it can be for those lucky enough to experience its deepest level.",2011

10,"Well, this is the first time I've written a film review, which you will probably gather as you continue reading! I felt I needed to write about this film just to get some of the emotion out of me and into some words. So this review may be more for me than for you.",2013
10,"This is one of the few movies that I can't get tired of watching it. It is absolutely amazing. The theme and story is just WOW! I was very happy when I first watched it, and I think I've watched 20 or more times after that. Every time I watch it, I cry like a little baby. Plus Shane West and Mandy Moore play their characters extremely well! I just can't get enough of this movie. The whole begins with a stupid little joke that turns out bad which leaves Clay Gephardt (Matt Lutz) in the hospital, and popular kid Landon Rollins Carter (Shane West) in a whole lot of trouble at school. Landon is then forced to participate in different school activities which included the drama club. While in the drama club, Landon is forced to work with Jamie Elizabeth Sullivan (Mandy Moore) who is a very shy, quiet, and book smart girl at the school. Jamie is the daughter of Rev. Hegbert Sullivan (Peter Coyote); Landon and Jamie have known each other for a while but because of their social statuses at school they have been in different spaces. Landon seeks help from Jamie when he has trouble with his lines and that is when they started to get close. Jamie was resistant in the beginning but slowly started falling for Landon. On the other hand Landon tried to hide his relationship with Jamie from his ""popular"" friends but later on when his friends disrespected Jamie, he defended her in front of the whole school. As they grew closer to each other, Jamie reveals to Landon that she is suffering from Leukemia and that she had stopped responding to the medication. Landon is upset at first but later on changes his mind, and decided to help Jamie fulfill her wish list (this is when the movie gets so good). After a while Landon and Jamie get married, and they live for a while before she passes away. Landon then goes back to see Jamie's dad, they have a little talk. Landon then leaves and is seen smiling at the sunset. The theme of this movie is love clearly. It is a very romantic movie and also sad. The theme was portrayed in a couple of scenes. The first one was when Landon defended Jamie in front of the whole school, which just showed that his love for her was strong that he was willing to confront his friends for her. The second was when he built her kaleidoscope just so she can fulfill her wish of watching a comet (extremely beautiful). This movie can be compared to the Notebook in my opinion. I personally haven't watched the movie but from what I've heard it seems like they are very similar. Lightning technique in this movie was used very well. Every time Landon and Jamie were having a beautiful moment, the light would be very bright, warm and actually peaceful. However during the rough times it would be a little bit gloomy just to match the mood.",2012
10,"I do not usually watch movies of the category Love-Romance, its just because i feel like adding some more boredom to a routine life full of responsibilities. So I used to kind of hate them as if they are real piece of torture until I happened to watch this movie. ",2009
9,"I saw this movie last Sunday night, and I have to say that I was deeply moved by it. I do not think that it had the cliches of teen films at all. If anything, the movie has a new perspective on teen love. Teen films today are mostly focused on ""getting laid"" or ""turning the ugly girl pretty"" (one way or another), just rent American Pie or She's All That. Not that there isn't a special place in my heart for these movies, but A Walk To Remember is in a class all by itself. The movie did have it's share of cheesy moments, due mostly to the overbearing dramatic musical score in certain scenes. Other than that, the characters were very genuine and the performances were most definitely heartfelt. Mandy Moore definitely holds her own in this movie as Jamie Sullivan, showing lots of emotional depth and making a complete transformation from teen pop goddess to modest southern girl. Shane West is a talent that should not be overlooked by Hollywood. He gets better and better in every film that he's in. He can do comedy (watch his underrated supporting comedic role in ""Get Over It""), and he tackles drama with ease in this film. Great supporting turns from Peter Coyote as Jamie's father, and from an aged Darryl Hannah as Landon's mother.",2002
10,"As I write this, I've just finished watching A Walk To Remember for the first time. I feel as if so many different emotions were pushed and pulled inside of me, but by no means was it in a bad way. Everything, and I mean everything, from the actors, to the script, were perfectly arranged so that every little moment in this movie takes the viewer on a journey, a journey through the lives of two lovestruck teens. This was no ordinary, sappy, teenage love though. The love portrayed by both Mandy Moore and Shane West was more than words could ever describe. ",2013
9,"Intense, with the intensity of the teenager heart.",2012
10,"I have read a couple reviews of this movie by ""Professional Reviewers"" and I don't see why most of them have a problem with it. Yeah the story is a little predictable (jock meets the geek). I've seen others movies like it and they didn't leave me feeling the way that I felt after watching this. I am a guy who always puts on a tough facade and never gets very emotional. But after the movie I missed Jamie and felt like I was right there with the other characters.",2004
10,"When rating this film, I rate it 15 out of 10. It is fantastic. The acting is superb, the storyline is fantastic, the direction is amazing and just about everything is brilliant. ",2007
10,"I first saw this movie when it came out, and I remember enjoying it as a nice, romantic ""weepie"" (a kind of movie I'm not averse too on occasion, although I can't watch the Lifetime network for more than 30 seconds at a time without reaching for the airsickness bag).",2006
2,"I guess this is, as much about exploitation of audience as it is about pleasing all corners of U.S. territory - So the next CSI would be shot on Hawaii or in Alaska. An more interesting take on the whole forensic/pathology/ballistics's, etc. idea would for instance to place it in the Victorian era in London or revolutionary France, where some of the greatest luxuries would be a ruler or a microscope; that to me would seem like a greater challenge.",2007
1,"That this show is simply a show, something that is meant to entertain and not to make you think. This is done American way - as simple as possible, as impossible as possible, as predictable as possible, as easy to swallow as possible. Do not and I repeat DO NOT confuse it with the original series. This is crap to anyone with more than 2 brain cells of use. The scriptwriters must've been recruited from a primary school - we cannot otherwise explain the lack of originality and the whole world of errors that emerge in every single episode. Clues that appears as soon as they're needed, always stupid suspects that A) are awaiting for the cops to come and arrest them; or/and B) leaving crucial evidence of a crime in the crime scene so the mighty Horatio (which is loathsome mockery with the Shakespeare's immortal Hamlet) can interfere. He is always right, he is carrying his head always climbed right so he can look more intelligent, he is carrying gun with intention to use it in every possible moment, the feelings of fear are unknown to him. There are no such things as corrupt cops and always and I mean really always the suspect is found and captured at the end with absolutely the right decision. The suspect always confess at the end, showing every possible remorse a suspect can give, leaving nothing to the judges to prove just because of the wonderful Horatio's job done. The evil is punished and the children may now go to bed. An ideal world, isn't it? The reality - there are plenty of wrong convicted persons serving time s in prison for crimes they do not commit. Showing ideal world does not help the society as whole for wrong hopes can do more harm than just showing crimes.",2008
3,"Recently this was added to my Netflix. I never watched it so I gave the first few seasons a go. The show is not intelligent at all, in fact, it not only feeds the viewer misinformation, it insults anyone with any intelligence. They make CSI look like super cops, about the same way Columbo and Monk make detectives look super impressive. Almost ever show is adorned with sexy guys and girls, rave music, and special effects that always go way beyond normal. ",2012
9,"Well, by now I have watched four years of this show, along with five years of the first CSI and two years of CSI-New York....and I could say a lot but will try to condense my thoughts to just a handful of opinions, namely:",2006
2,"I was a big fan of the original series (Las Vegas). Sadly this show seems to be nothing more than beautiful actors and cinematography. I won't lie to you, the actors are hot, and the scenery is awesome. Thats why i gave it a whopping 2/10. Nothing else grabbed me though.",2007
1,"This is the worst dramatic show on television and I attribute most of that to David Caruso. His stilted line reading in ""dramatic whispers"", constant posing, and egotistical characterization are just AWFUL! Maybe he's a nice guy, maybe he's easy to work with, maybe he came cheap, there must be SOME reason he was hired because it surely wasn't his acting. I think he may very well be the worst actor to hold a SAG card and have a steady paycheck. His idea of acting is to say every line with a quarter turn to the camera, lift up his chin, spread his legs out overly wide and throw his hands on his hips. I'm serious; EVERY single episode, he uses exactly the same moves over and over. Apparently the directors are powerless to do anything about it. Perhaps he just can't take direction; or the producers are hiring really bad directors every week; or maybe it's in his contract that he doesn't have to listen to directors. No decent director would allow this to go on week after week. (I suspect they just throw up their hands, since Caruso appears to be completely unrepentant.)",2011
1,"After ""discovering"" the original CSI television show, hearing great things about this spin-off, seeing its high ranking in the weekly ratings, and enjoying the pilot episode (the second season CSI episode, ""Cross-Jurisdictions""), I was really looking forward to seeing CSI: Miami. Upon viewing the first season, I found it to be pretty unfulfilling, and it left me with no desire to watch the second season. However, I decided to give it another shot and watched the second season, which I enjoyed much more than the first. While I still thought the case stories were poor, the second season was where the main characters' personal lives began to take up some of the episodes, which I found to be the best thing the series had going for it (especially the subplot of Horatio's brother and his possible corrupt ways, as well as Horatio's feelings for Yelena). But upon starting to watch the first eight episodes of the third and fourth season, I found myself getting the same bitter taste in my mouth.",2006
7,"CSI Miami is an entertaining show that really has picked up David Caruso's career up from the Ocean floor. He is very blessed, indeed, to be experiencing success as a lead actor on a famous show since his NYPD Blue days.",2005
1,"For those who think this is a good show you are wrong. It should be called CSI:No emotion. Not one person shows any emotion for what is going on around them. Caruso was a good actor, but not anymore - I can tell you how he rolls as Horatio. While in interrogation, he whips off his sunglasses, flips his coat back as he puts his hands on his hips, says some smart ass remark to the criminal and then rolls off camera. End Scene. The chick that plays Calliegh is good looking, but I have seen people that have just got botox injections have more facial expressions then she does in one episode. Jonathan Togo looks like a the robotic brother of Gregg of CSI, who is constantly flawed, and the guy who plays Eric has a look on his face like he is constipated. The stories are not that good and the characters are laughable. This show is bad. To say it is better then CSI and CSI:NY someone is smoking something that impares their judgment. Give Gil Grissom, Mac Taylor, or even Ray Langston a try. You will definitely enjoy them much better than this piece of dung.",2009
1,Instead of going for the low-hanging fruit critiques to CSI: Miami I am going to point your direction at a lesser discussed but equally insulting element of the show.,2013
2,Since when do CSI technicians have medical degrees? Since when do people from the medical examiner's office investigate crime suspects and make arrests? Since when is acting and writing this bad deserving of high ratings? ,2007
2,"Well, when the show started I noticed right away the colors were so vivid they were not realistic. NO PLACE on earth has colors of skies, grass & water so vivid and dark! It's FAKE looking! I first thought our TV color levels needed adjusting, it was so obvious, but when the commercial came on, it was normal again. Then I noticed every week, that every show pushed the button on MORE color. I learned to overlook it to watch the show though, for a few years.",2012
1,"Would you believe a stone-faced unnatural blonde in spike heels, a low-cut top and a push-up bra? She's a ""real crime investigator"" in the ""real world"" of Miami. Isn't she? When she opens her mouth to speak, your ears are assaulted with a squeaky, winy, nasal monotony falling from a face covered with so much paint that it rivals that of Bozo The Clown. You keep watching with anticipation that she just might smile. And if she did, what would happen? Maybe her face would crack and the first five layers would fall off onto her spiky heeled boots, contaminating the crime scene. She enters the crime scene lab and puts on her white lab coat. Leaving it unbuttoned and open as to keep her cleavage well exposed to the air, (it must be hot in Miami) she pulls out a slide and places it under the microscope. The hippest of music starts to play as her camera-like eye probes through the lens, searching, investigating, not missing an atom or a microbe. What does she see? What is it that her brilliant Einstein-like mind has wrapped itself around? She must be a genius, or at least some kind of superior being. Isn't she?",2009
5,"Everything looks really glamorous in CSI Miami. While almost every show looks better on HDTV, CSI-Miami stands above the others. This show was made for HD. The landscape is ultra-modern, lush, and sexy. The interior decors are 22nd century. And the graphics and color coordinations are top notch. However beneath all that CGI and funky high tech devices that investigators use, there is little of redeeming value in this show. When it comes to what really counts, the characters, CSI Miami falls way short. The acting is wooden and one-dimensional. The dialog is bland and sometimes cheesy. When I watch this show, cast members don't even seem human. They just don't seem real. ",2007
4,"for me,this is by far,the weakest entry in the CSI cannon.it's not that the stories are uninteresting.many of them are.most of the characters are done well enough,except for two notable exceptions.the first exception,and this is just my opinion,is the character of Dr. Alexx Woods,the medical examiner,played by Khandi Alexander.i find the character much too weepy,at least in the earlier episodes i have watched that might be different now.i think Khandi Alexander is a good actress,given a weak character to portray.the character with biggest flaw,at leas in my opinion,is Lieutenant Horatio Caine,Played by David Caruso.Caine is the leader of the team.this character is just way too annoying for me.Caine is just a poser to me,with his supposedly thoughtful demeanor at the end of each episode where he looks out at the ocean with this hands on his hips and his cool looking sun glasses on.i also find his speech pattern annoying.this character sinks the whole show and makes it all but unwatchable.this may not bother everybody,but it sure does bother me.in fact,i dislike the character enough that i have not bought any CSI:Miami on DVD,and probably won't.again,this is the character,not the actor.and the character may be different now.i don't have anything against Caruso.this is just my view.for me,CSI:Miami is a 4/10",2008
5,"I do not hate this show. In fact I often find this show intriguing. Yeah, that's right! Intriguing! It has the mystique of the original CSI with the stylistic aura of the late, great Miami Vice! Unlike Cold Case! I wouldn't mind watching a marathon of this. CSI Miami has some pretty interesting characters, Horatio Caine, especially. But alas, this is not Miami Vice. In fact this is where CSI Miami falls short of the ""winner circle"" in my opinion of course. This show has none of the street cred grittiness of the 80's cop drama. Miami Vice not only displays the flashed-up culture of the South Beach social scene, but it examines the underworld in great detail. In CSI's case, we are exposed to mundane and obnoxious stereotypes from the African-American crackheads/gangbangers to the drug-pushing/child abducting White Trash venom. CSI Miami is in a shallow picture-perfect dreamworld. A dreamworld where everyone considered a normal citizen is under 50, drives a Lexus Lux-ed out SUV, lives in a subdivisions and wears a designer suit to work. And every woman is a thin gorgeous knock-out with model proportions. What cop would wear high heels to work? C'mon here! ",2008

1,"Now, I am a faithful watcher of all the CSIs and I have watched them for many years, and there are some fantastic things about the CSIs that I love and they're the reason that I'm hooked on this brilliant series's. But I cannot stress enough how much I cannot stand this show. I used to love my week, I mean, I got to watch three different episodes of CSI. But I was disappointed in Miami to begin with. The main reason being David Caruso, he cannot act. He is such a joy to make fun of though. But has anyone else noticed that these people only solve ONE crime an episode. The other ones solve only one crime an episode when it's like the miniature killer, or the beginning or end to a long story arc similar. This CSI just bothers me, sometimes they have good story lines, but others are just dreadful. I cannot believe that this actually one an Emmy. All of the other CSIs have a great cast that can carry the show, but this? It just can't compete.",2008
1,"Having just watched this show for the first time in May of 2007, I was amazed that it was (is?) so popular. David Caruso is just unbelievably BAD. I'd only seen him in a movie (Proof of Life), in which he also stunk up the place - just really bad, so at least he's consistent. And as bad an ""over-actor"" Caruso is, Emily Procter under-acts, as if she were sleepwalking through her lines. The story was just plain silly, with a mixture of absurdly contrived situations involving a plane crash, ""billions"" in checks as cargo, a dead ex-drug addicted girl who ran a charity for other such girls, etc. The ""cops"" do no real detective work, but simply announce one plot-induced conclusion after another to ""solve"" the crime, throwing in a little psycho-cop nonsense and sexual harassment to fill in the extra space in this very thin story. This show is a real stinker.",2007

10,I've been watching this show for over 7 years now and I have to say it just keeps getting better. Many people spit and shout about the show not being about cars and more of an entertainment show than a car show. Well firstly let me say that this show began in 1978and went on for 12 seasons and the one complaint about that show was that it was boring and Clarkson picked up on this and changed the show (in my view) for the better.,2010
1,"It was such a great show, and now it is going to suck. I will not watch ""Top Gear"" with new hosts. The previews are horrible enough to sit through while I'm watching old episodes with the REAL hosts. I will instead watch Clarkson, Hammond, and May's new show on amazon. I totally recommend watching if it is from before 2016. Why put an unfunny American on this show when there is already an unfunny American Top Gear, and still I, being American, choose to watch the much better Top Gear UK? Plus to replace 3 super attractive, hilarious men with 2 losers is a dumb idea if you want your show to be successful. Or at least remain on air. I hope this show tanks so I can watch reruns of the old Top Gear without having to change the channel when the new episodes are on. Or have them sneak into my recordings. New Top Gear, you suck.",2016

3,"Now I'm not sure who Chris Evans was before this show or why he is on it but he was the wrong choice! He is a very annoying knock off of Jeremy Clarkson and he makes the show hard to watch. I thought it was kind of bad when American top gear just does a low budget rip off of an old UK episode but Chris Evans is trying to rip off a personality. Hopefully the top gear producers get their heads clear and sort the show out and get it back to its former glory. Side note, I think matt Leblanc is perfect for top gear but put him on American top gear with Foust and anyone other than Rutledge wood and that would be a great show!",2016

A joyous blast of post-9/11 American verve, crafted with class and a keen eye for storytelling, Sam Raimi's 2002 mega-hit is a once-in-a-lifetime, generation defining summer blockbuster, and in the eyes of this Generation Spider-Man-er, it's still the gold standard in superhero cinema.",2016

I couldn't believe how much fun I had watching this movie: the fights, the costumes, the characters I'm not even a comic book nerd, no offense to those who are, just I couldn't believe how much of a nerd I felt like when I was jumping and getting excited to see this movie. I waited an hour in line to see this movie with my friends and I have to tell you that it was completely worth it. This is the crazy movie of the summer, but it's one of the best blockbusters to come out of the new millennium.

With $200 million dollars you can buy  many state of the art special effects for the director to full around with to his hearts content.  If in the process, though, he decides to fore-go an entertaining story and script, characters that we can get to know and sympathize with, and good actors to bring those characters to life, all the special effects in the world isn't going to amount to a hill of beans.

I really looked forward to the American Godzilla movie and by golly it was a huge disappointment. Then I really looked forward to Star Wars episode 1 and although it was not the disappointment Godzilla was, it was still a disappointment. Spider-man however was everything I was hoping it to be. In fact, it has to be considered one of the best comic book adaptations ever. It actually took parts of the comic book and incorporated it into the movie. Unlike most comic book movies where the story doesn't come from any of the comic books. Sure there are some departures such as the organic web shooters, but this is acceptable seeing as how watching Peter Parker learning he has them makes for some humorous scenes. The entire cast did a great job capturing the characters they were playing and there are some great fights as well. This is also a departure from most comic book movies where there is really no good fight at all between the heroes and villains.",2005

This film however has again demonstrated that an adaptation of a comic book story can be  fun and faithful to the story, yet be a film for all ages and those who may not have ever even read a comic book.  The Crow was the only other good comic book movie in my opinion, but it was not an all ages fun ride as this is!",2002
9,"Considered as one of the most successful superhero movies ever made, ""Spider-Man"" is a superhero film adaptation of one of Stan Lee's most popular Marvel comics, and becoming one of the first movies to score the highest opening weekend in the box office. There's no wonder, because this is an exciting and enjoyable motion picture. One of my childhood favorites, to be exact! This movie tells the origin story of Peter Parker, or Spider-Man, portrayed by Tobey Maguire, whom after being bit by a radioactive spider, he has gained extraordinary powers to climb walls, shoot web, and beat bad guys. But all that must be put to the test when Parker has to defeat one of the first villains of the Spider-Man universe, the Green Goblin, portrayed by Willem Dafoe. Although Maguire is somewhat bland in a few of his movies, I respected that he fit the role of Peter Parker perfectly, playing a shy kid, with no powers to either beat the bad guy or win the girl. Although given some of the corniest lines of dialouge in this movie, Kirsten Dunst makes an adorable portrayal as Mary Jane Watson, while giving a great chemistry with her co-star. But, Willem Dafoe seems a little miscast playing the deadly Green Goblin, feeling more like he's suitable for drama, instead of action. Rosemary Harris, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, and J.K. Simmons, round up the supporting cast, bringing some memorable performances on-screen, especially Simmons, who steals every scene he's in as J. Jonah Jameson, the angry editor chief of the Daily Bugle. There are few corny and goofy moments from here and there, but that doesn't stop the exciting momentum that this movie brings. Filled with impressive visual effects and a wonderful music score by Danny Elfman, director Sam Raimi perfectly stays true to the original Spider-Man concept, and delivers plenty of exciting action sequences that are both fun to watch, and stay true to the plot. Behind ""The Dark Knight"" and ""The Avengers"", ""Spider-Man"" is probably my third favorite superhero movie. I can watch this movie over and over again, and it's still a fun time. I was easily impressed with this movie, and it never disappoints to entertain. Everyone will find something to enjoy for sure. ""Spider-Man"", in my review, ""a refreshing story, and exciting action"".",2012

10,"Saw it again, last night, after a long time and it still managed to catch my attention and I noticed such small (intrinsic) details embedded throughout the movie that it looks like Sam Raimi really spun an amazingly entertaining movie through strings of comic-web. One of the best origin stories that like an old wine, keeps getting better because it is laden with story, a soul that only gets more enlightened by CGI. Sam Raimi researched the material well and it shows, be it having some inside jokes, Easter eggs and how he got the hero got name. The first 30 minutes is simply the best ""origin of origin"", a superhero flick has shown till date. Best thing is he got so much comfortable with it that he made even amazing second part (one of the best sequels till date) (tied up with T2) but still nothing beats an origin story because it shows ""Even you can be"".",2017
1,"I don't understand how this movie made the top 250, although it wasn't awful, it was boring, unoriginal and appalling as far as special effects go. Far more enthralling, poignant and visually impressive films have been made on a shoe string budget. Most of the acting was respectable, especially from Dafoe who went a long way with his limited time on-screen and one-dimensional character (like most of the others) but Kirsten Dunst? I don't care if her simplicity makes her good for the character, I see no chemistry between her and Maguire. This movie was a big disappointment. What a waste of talent and vision from Maguire and the once great Raimi.",2002
1,"Give me a break.  Top 200 movie of all time?  Not even close.  The bad guy in the movie was one of the worst characters I've ever seen.  It just was not a very good flick.  It tried to build up the love between Peter Parker and the girl and then all of a sudden, he just can't be with her?  Please. This movie will become a cult movie and will get good rating because people will be afraid to speak the truth, which was, this movie wasn't very good. However, I feel that the sequel might be better because they don't have to build up the character so much.",2002
1,"Okay, first let me say, that I have not got a problem with the changes made to the film, in fact they kinda made the film cooler.  But here's where I lost interest.  Tobey McGuire is not very good as Peter, in fact, he seems bored, which is never very good for a leading man to be.  And he has impressed me, especially in films such as the Cider House Rules, so I don't hate him. Kirsten Dunst is pretty good as Mary Jane, Uncle Ben should have been allowed appear for longer, as he is integral to Spider-man's origin, ***possible spoiler*** his death is like a key scene in a play, but it is brushed over very quickly, which seems lazy.***  The relationship between Norman and Harry, is very interesting, much more so than the main story, and is the one really developed portion of the film.  But back to Tobey. Well, in my opinion, Tobey is not able to convey the sense of responsibility which, look at the spoiler, taught him.  That speech he makes to MJ at the hospital, about what he told Spider-man, was cringe inducing, really over the top sappy.  He is also not physical at all.  Like Keaton in Batman, Tobey is rarely in the suit, and so all of Spidey's stunts are by stuntmen. These include even the basic, like where Spidey webs down before kissing MJ and the simplest fights (all classic poses are assumed by stuntmen) and so Dafoe was right about him being a wimp.  I know this might seem like nit-picking, but actors who do all or most of their stunts seem to absorb the idea of the character more, and get into the role better.  Some don't like Dafoe, or the Goblin outfit, but I think the suit works in the film and is really cool, and also Dafoe outclasses McGuire.  The only good thing for me was the the costume, which was great.  Some scenes of CGI were poor, but the last 2 minutes of it was the best part of the movie for me.  Many will say that it's only a summer blockbuster, but if they have read a comic of Spider-man, and I don't mean the issues included with the DVD (which were not the best, to be honest), then they'll be able to see where the filmmakers failed.",2003
8,"At first I thought I was going to see a lightweight film from a great director but instead I watched another impressive achievement by Steven Spielberg. A few things stand out and of course the performances are terrific. Leonardo Dicaprio is believable as a guy that can convince people that he's someone else. Dicaprio is a charmer and is very smooth as we watch his character do some fancy talk to the young ladies. Tom Hanks as the FBI agent reminds me of his cynical character that he played in ""A League of Their Own"" and his mere presence adds more to this film. The sign of a great film star. And Christopher Walken gives one of his best performances in his already interesting career. The last scene of him as he talks to his son in the restaurant is so moving that it reflects on the great talent of Walken. You can understand why Dicaprio admires and loves his father. Walken conveys these emotions and makes the audience react just accurately. I'll be rooting for him at Oscar time. Another impressive thing about this film is the beautiful cinematography by Janusz Kaminski who's a real artist with a camera and has worked on several Spielberg films. One shot in particular stands out. The ray of sunshine coming in through the kitchen window on Walken. Very thought provoking. And of course since its a Spielberg film its very personal. Spielberg was interested in the Frank Abagnale character because as a youngster he also came from a broken family and wanted to be someone else. Spielberg would sneak onto the studios and tell people that he worked there. Also, the real Frank Abagnale jr. appears as a French police officer. Well made, extremely well acted and sharply written. Viewers seem to forget that this is really a film about the breaking up of a family and the aftermath. This really is a personal film from Spielberg, and a very good one.",2003
10,From the opening credits design we get in the mood of this very entertaining film. They create the tone for what will follow. Steven Spielberg is in rare form directing this movie that doesn't have a dull moment.,2003
8,"This was an entertaining and fun piece of film making from the ever-reliable Steven Spielberg. It is a bit of a depart from his usual full-blown and hugely epic pictures, yet this does not detract at all from the fascinating story of Frank Abagnale Jr. I was interested in this man before I'd seen the movie, and it only served to increase my interest. Although it is important to remember (as with any such film) that this is only 'inspired' by a true story and not told word for word from one, the plot is fascinating and keeps you laughing, crying and wondering until the end.",2005
9,"While watching 'Catch Me If You Can' I had so much fun I smiled constantly. Well, that smile was interrupted by laughs. The movie tells the story of Frank W. Abignale, Jr. who is just a kid as he pretends to be a schoolteacher. After his father and mother get a divorce he runs away and starts pretending to be a co-pilot, a doctor, a lawyer. The way he does this is funny and brilliant.",2003
8,"I Don't know how accurate these events are but as they are based on accounts written by Frank Abagale Jr. himself, then i assume that they are probably only dramatised for the viewing audience.",2005
8,"""Catch Me If You Can"" is based on the true story of Frank Abagnale, the most successful conman in history. By the age of 19, Frank had already posed as a pilot for Pan Am, paraded around as a medical doctor, and fooled everyone by taking an on-the-side-job as a lawyer. (By the way, he faked a Harvard-graduate diploma to become one.) During this time he cashed fraudulent checks at various banks around the country, and eventually around various places in the world. His is an amazing story, and this film is based on it.",2003
10,"I have just finished this movie and I can honestly say this is such a addictive movie!! once you have watched it you want to watch it over and over again!!! It is so funny how Frank passes himself off as a Pam Am pilot, a lawyer and a doctor all before he is 21. It is also a shame at the end where Carl tells Frank his father is dead and he doesn't believe it. It is funny at the beginning where Frank says he is dying and they take him to the hospital and he escapes and when he pretended to be a substitute teachers and calls himself Mr Abagnale and when he embarrasses the bully in front of the entire class!!!! He looks so cute as a boy!!",2014
4,BEWARE OF BOGUS REVIEWS & REVIEWERS. SOME REVIEWERS HAVE ONLY ONE REVIEW. WHEN ITS A POSITIVE REVIEW THAT TELLS ME THEY WERE INVOLVED WITH THE PRODUCTION. TRUST ME THIS FILM IS TERRIBLE. NOW I HAVE REVIEWED OVER 400 Christmas MOVIES. I HAVE NO AGENDA. I AM FARE,2017
8,"Steven Spielberg has what you might call D.W. Griffith disease. If he can't make a monumental film, he makes an insignificant one. I thought that, anyway, until a second viewing of ""Catch Me If You Can"" convinced me I was wrong. Like many great artists, Spielberg doesn't have to swing for the fences to make an indelible impression every time out.",2006
8,"An all-around good movie worth seeing.  The plot is pretty basic: Quick-thinking kid from a broken family that he loved.  He spent the next few years playing a pilot, doctor, and lawyer.  Think ""Pretender"" (the television series) but based on real events.  The surprise was the unique relationship of the FBI agent and the con-man in their cat-and-mouse chase they have over the years around the globe.  An engaging film that you are curious to see how it ends. That goes even for my girlfriend who stayed awake for the entire movie because she was captivated by it [Note: she has slept thru ""Gladiator"", ""Shakespeare in Love"", ""Elizabeth"", and the ""Fellowship of the Ring"" because they (apparently) didn't peak her interest].  So if your date is the discriminating-type, he/she should be able to sit through this movie and enjoy it.",2003
8,"Catch Me If You Can is a pretty interesting movie that is supposedly based on the life of Frank Abagnale, who, before his 19th birthday, successfully performed cons worth millions of dollars. He was allow to pull this off, by posing high income jobs, and forging payroll checks. The movie by Steven Spielberg is really trying hard, not to say based off true events, as the movie use 'inspired by a true story"" in order to avoid controversy similar to other past biographical films, which deviated from history. In my opinion, the movie doesn't deviated from the autobiography of Frank Abagnale too much. The movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio as the teenager Frank Abagnale who after witnessing his parents awful divorce, run away. When he runs out of money, he begins to rely on confidence scams to get by. Soon, Frank's cons grow bolder and he even impersonates an airline pilot, a Georgia doctor, and a Louisiana parish prosecutor. He drew attention by the FBI Bank fraud agency lead by Det. Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks). Soon enough, it become a game of cat and mouse, with Frank trying everything to try to escape, and Carl trying everything to try to catch him. Set in the 1960s, the movie has this early James Bond type spy genre escapism theme going with it. Even the opening of the film by Olivier Kuntzel & Florence Deygas, looks something out of a 1960s spy film with its one of a kind title sequence. The slender Lowreyesque stamp style animation figures run through environments that symbolize key plot points from the film to the 1960s jazz-era score by John Williams is amazing and memorable. The movie was shot with bright vibrant colors, bringing out the world that no longer exist, built on trust and a firm handshake. There is a few historical anachronisms, but nothing really standing out for too long. The movie is pretty predictable as it gives you the whole story in the opening shot of the film. Approximately 80 percent of the movie is true based on Frank Abagnale Jr's account, but there were some stuff, they didn't mention on the film, the producers change or Frank just make it up. After all, Frank is indeed a consummate liar. Lots of plot holes or scenes never truly explain well. There is one outlandish scene with him looking for female airplane attendant recruits just in the space of one day and another one escaping a jet through the toilet. You have to hold, suspense of disbelief here. There was a stint, not added to the film, where Frank was professor of sociology at a college in Salt Lake City, Utah that was supposedly cut due to time constraints; but the truth is, the college, Brigham Young University, repudiates this claim that he never did teach there. The film, somewhat change it to him pretending to a French teacher in the beginning a local New York school. Another thing is his relationship with his father. In the film, Frank has a strong relationship with his dad. His father love that his son is stealing from the government and business, because they didn't support him when his business went under. Not in the case of real life, as his first victim was indeed his father stealing $3,400 from him in credit card fraud. Also, Abagnale never saw his father after he ran away from home, unlike the film. Other minor changes is that, the movie omitted his two jail attempts to get away from prison and his time in France. It would be nice to see that, both the movie would had been long. One more thing, FBI officer who was chasing Frank was really Joe Shea. Frank Abagnale Jr. used the pseudonym ""Sean O'Reilly"" in his book because Joe Shea was still in the F. B. I. He has since passed away, but the movie still used a new name, Carl Hanratty. I love the relationship between Frank and Carl in this movie. The chemistry in their respective roles is what breathes life into this film. There is a great scene at a motel between the two. The whole act was so risky. Leo play Frank with integrity and accuracy. He got the suave playboy down being bold and stylish. Tom Hanks was great as Carl. Season actor by this time, going toe to toe with a then, still-green, Leo. There is another great scene where both of their character call on Christmas. You can really tell the lack of family in Leo's character making him sympathy giving him a Freudian excuse. As less, he wasn't unlikeable. Catch me if You Can deals with themes of broken homes and troubled childhoods so well. The female characters played by Jennifer Garner, Ellen Pompeo and Elizabeth Banks were alright, but in my opinion, I have to say, Amy Adams as Brenda Strong was the best. Amy Adams as Brenda Strong gave one of the best performance in the film, as the emotional Brenda. I felt sad on what happen to her character. Also check out, the real Frank Abagnale as one of the French police officers toward the end. The music is great. I love the way, they use Frank Sinatra 'come fly with me'. Full of fantasy glam. The movie comes with a good moral message. Overall: Highly Informative and Incredibly Life Changing, Yet Subtly Descriptive and Wildly Entertaining. Worth the watch. So catch it!",2014

10,"I think the movie is some kind of comedy. What would you say about that? The most of my friends think that the movie is not funny. They think that it's too serious. I watched it 3 years ago and i truly had fun. Tom and Leo act very comical.The way that Leo's character lies everybody about his life and his job is very, very, very interesting!Tom's character chaising is laughmaker too!When he take all the pink clothes from the washmachine and so on...when Leo cheat Tom with the document in the hotel room...when hot girl throw at Leo the playcards and ask more money...when Tom sing at the table on cristmas and slap his hands...and more and more funny staff about this great movie! I cant understand why they told me that this movie is not funny!?!",2006
7,"This is kind of an odd story, another one of those based-on-a-true life tales. This was hyped up a little too much for me because I expected more than what the film delivered. However, it was still a decent yarn about a kid who impersonated people in different professions and forged checks along the way. He did all of this in his teenage years.",2006
10,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It had everything - great actors, great music by John Williams, the amazing director Steven Spielberg. It wasn't boring for a second although being over 2 hours long. I simply didn't want it to end and this is the main reason I gave the movie a 10. ",2014

9,"Everyone see movie and try to find out a part of stories that match their own, I mean personal life. Some stories more or less similar their personal experience. There are something inside of everyone that can not be reveal for some social reason. This thing and whatever it is like pain, past, situation, dream, mistakes all that you can not tell to someone makes you alone. You have everything around you that can make you happy related to material. But the thing inside of you makes you condemn. Because you can not say it out loud to others to accept. It is very hard to tolerate to bear. You know a simple incident could happen to many of you but you can't confess or sometime hide. When you find the similar thing also happen to someone else then you will find that it's not only you there are someone else who are like you. It seems like someone share your burden and feel much better. The story of the movie tell you that you are not alone and of-course teaches you not to take a role of the same mistake. The effect of the relation between parent on their children is very meaningful. It motivate your children.It's my personal aspect of seeing movies.",2014
