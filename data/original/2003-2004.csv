9,"*SPOILERS NCIS* The NCIS (Navy Criminal Investigative Service) is a service that investigates on any kind of crime, from barroom brawls to international terrorism, that involves men and women from the Navy or Marine Corps.",2006
6,"This show has survived the coming and going of many cast members over the years, but the latest changes -- Michael Weatherly out, Jennifer Esposito and Wilmer Valderrama in -- doesn't look promising. ",2016
5,"I am very disappointed with this season's cast changes. I have been a loyal fan of NCIS from the very beginning. I've always enjoyed the show and thought the writing was great and the characters were believable. But Jennifer Esposito has all but ruined the show for me. I find her to be rude, arrogant, obtrusive and obnoxious. She definitely Does Not fit in with the team! Wilmer Valderrama may eventually fit in, once he learns that he is there to work, not to flirt with every skirt on the show and search for apartments while he is supposed to be working a crime scene! Also, the writing has taken a decided turn for the worse - the character's parts are all over the place, and it seems they have no idea what they are doing with Jimmy Palmer this season. The show used to be balanced, told a good story, and treated all of the characters well. Now it seems they have lost their way caring more about jumping on the politically correct, diversity, and inclusive bandwagon than with creating the award winning show they have had for all these years. Very sad to see such a great show fall apart like this :-(",2016
1,"Recently sat through a virtual marathon of episodes from various seasons and came away disappointed and disbelieving. This show seems to have devolved to the low levels first achieved with ""24"" showing government agents doing bad things for good reasons. Suspects/witnesses are routinely subjected to insults, lies and in many instances physical abuse to achieve ends. Superiors, agents of similar agencies and other services as well as local law enforcement are routinely treated with ill-disguised contempt if not outright disdain.",2013
10,This is a great series to watch.  I have been hooked on this show since the beginning because I love watching mysteries and crime like CSI and CSI Miami.  Harmon's so sexy in this role and McCallum is always a joy to watch as Ducky especially when he's on the role over various anthropology lectures which to my amusement everyone on that shows roll up their eyeballs.,2004
1,"A friend of mine describes the cast of characters in this show as ""a delightfully dysfunctional family."" I certainly will agree that they are dysfunctional. Delightful? Not so much.",2012
4,"First off, I have to agree with a minority of other reviewers who describe the show's characters as stereotypical and irritating. Secondly, NCIS are detectives, who investigate crimes usually taking place on Navy jurisdiction, or sometimes involving high-profile Naval personnel. They are not a combination of the FBI or the CIA. They do not conduct counter-terrorism operations or any overseas covert ops. They do not run off to the hills of W. Virginia to find out why a Marine on leave fell of a cliff. They do not work out of a headquarters with an electronics array and lab resembling something out of a sci-fi set. They do not drive at break-neck speed without being stopped by local police. They are not at odds with all other law enforcement agencies, and are definitely not superior to any of them. It is not considered inferior duty to be assigned to a regional office or aboard a ship. In short, NCIS is an agency of competent investigators who perform their jobs with the same resources as most other agencies. They are portrayed on TV with a lot of artistic license.",2013
10,"There is simply nothing about NCIS that is not to like. I'll get the superficial stuff out of the way first - every camera angle on Michael Weatherly is gorgeous, and he plays it so well as Anthony DiNozzo. Ziva, his partner, is most adorable with every cultural nuance she utters as she tries to grasp American idioms. It's charming and realistic. Her ability to speak Israeli for some plot lines truly adds to her beauty and character-balancing the serious with the humorous sides of the show. Bringing David McCallum into our lives again brings the emotion of nostalgia. How we loved his British accent in THE MAN FOR U.N.C.L.E. His charming ramblings, his sensitivity to forensics, and his educational lessons are perfect. Characters McGee and Abby play perfectly off each other. and Mark Harmon is the guiding treasure. Tie up in a bow, and they have all played their characters so convincingly that we are invited to be part of their team every week. That's true TV. The bonus: no foul language, machine guns blaring, and no sex (but plenty of engaging innuendos). Please tune in. This show is such a delight.",2009
2,"As a prior Marine, I know what NCIS actually does, and chasing terrorists through the streets of Washington DC is not it. If they were trying to make this a serious show, they failed horribly. I gave the show a chance because I was intrigued by the two part JAG episode in which it was introduced, but on it's own it fails to hold water. It basically became ""how can we make JAG more like CSI?"" Half the time they are investigating crimes that would be under FBI jurisdiction (notibly terrorism). The absolute worst part is the characters which are so stereotypical and one-dimensional:",2009
3,"The first couple of seasons are great, with the chocking ending of season two finale ""Twilight"" as a specific high-point. Then the show stumbles a bit for a season or two, before it creates perhaps the best episodes and best entertainment you can find anywhere. But then it starts to slowly go downwards, and lately it is hardly watchable. ",2016
3,I'm reviewing NCIS after watching 12 seasons.,2016
2,"(cue The Cranberries song ""Disappointment) The first episode I saw of NCIS was the one where the great (now late) Charles Durning played the Medal of Honor recipient, and I thought, ""wow, this is really good."" So my wife picked up the first 3 season on DVD at a garage sale (FIRST WARNING!) so I sat down to watch.",2013
10,"Today, the TV is fulled with stuff, you can find almost everything. And if crime is what you 're looking for, CSI Miami or CSI NY are the average answers. Why? Very easy: American government, then American people, then American nation wants to see themselves like Superman all the time. That's why we see Gary Sinsie breaking a terrorist, David Carusso putting his sunglasses and shaking the hand of his Mexican friend, who in the next episode, he may kill, after doing what they call ""justice"" OK, ladies and germs: for those that think that crime and justice are so easy words, I'm sorry to tell you: You're wrong. Crime is not that easy. And, as I said before, the TV is fulled. So, we also have the ""true crime"" shows like Criminal Minds, Law And Order CI and SVU, Withouth a Trace and many more. In Law And Order CI, they usually focus on the victims, with very strong and dense cases, but someone wonders: ""What about the investigator itself? Does it have to be danger danger all the time or can you have some fun?"" If that is your question, NCIS is one of your main answers. NCIS comes from Donald P. Bellisario, the creator of the well-known series JAG. He was also a writer of several Magnum P.1 episodes. NCIS is, more than just forensics, it's a character show. It's the story of the in and out relationships of the investigators and scientists of an agency that does anything criminal tied up to the marines, thing that Bellisario liked to do also in JAG. Therefore, we can find humor, drama, love, tragedy, and some bits of US action, besides of one of the most unusual characters you can find on such genre: an 50's former marine is the leader, a goth forensics and an 86 years old Scotish M.E that talks to his corpses. If we do a season analysis on the show, we can conclude that, it has been rising to good. The first season was a bit of CSI style, everyone was just cool. But it already had the trademark humor and a good ending. Season 2 could have initially been the same case, but the end was totally surprising. Season 3 was a very ruff one, were mistakes and chance are all the time, 4 was just human, and 5... Well, 5 has not shown up yet down here at Mexico, but I have heard that is good. NCIS is, in summary: Human 10/10 GREAT CAST GREAT CHARACTERS GREAT HUMOR GREAT...",2008
9,"Being a big Dark Angel fan (at least a Season One Dark Angel fan), my main reason for watching NCIS originally was Michael Weatherly. Seeing how he could play someone so different from Logan Cale was fascinating for me. That fact that Mark Harmon (whom I've always enjoyed watching)and David McCallum (fan of the Shaphire and Steel program)were also in the program was a bonus. My sister in law is a Mark Harmon fan, so she got something out of the program and everybody (my father included) loves Abby. This is a program that everyone in the family can get something out of. The occasional Dark Angel reference thrown in adds to my fun. (i.e William Gregory Lee who played Zack in Dark Angel was a guest star and was the actor who played Logan's Uncle Jonas)",2006
2,"Okay I'll make it short : this show has good potential, could have been a major TV Success, but as it starts with the main theme, you immediately know what's up....some cheap synthetic piano track, with no mood and no spirit, that compared to this even Charlie Harper's jingles sound better...! PLUS, how the hell can you be as arrogant as the Gibbs character..?! I mean, who the hell does he think he is, some kinda God or something ? by hitting his employees behind the head and directing orders the way he does...The guy pisses off after 10minutes of watching, THIS IS NOT FUNNY ! I wouldn't even show this series to my kid, being afraid he'd have a wrong opinion of respect and human behavior...",2011
8,"I've been watching NCIS since it started and have been a regular viewer since the debut. The first reason I tuned in was simple - Mark Harmon. Second reason was, well, Michael Weatherly. David McCallum was just a really nice bonus. That being said ... I know that NCIS as it is shown on the screen is ludicrous, so is CSI and all its off shoots, but if you show what really happens in any investigation you'll chase off the audience with boredom.",2008
3,"I know I can't be the only person out there that sees through this show's god-awful cheesiness! For crying out loud every character is completely unoriginal cop cliché: an old bitter chauvinist leader, an asshat trigger-happy tough guy, a noobish rookie, a jaded female cop always trying to show that she's man enough for the job, and nerdy techie that knows everything, yet manages to remain 'cool' at the same time. Every episode begins with Gibbs saying ""We've got a dead Marine!"" and ends with the team stopping Al-Quada's latest plot to blow up Washington DC. ",2010
10,"I just finished viewing the very last episode of one my most favorite TV shows that's known as 'The O.C.' and wanted to share my thoughts on what it meant to me and why! It grabbed my attention from the very first episode with incredible acting and a great cast with awesome chemistry amongst them and with a quirky and witty scrip and also showed fabulous taste in fashion and makeup which was fun to look at all the time! Great indie bands featured in the background always seemed to strike up the right mood and accentuate the emotional drama occurrences during the show! It introduced me to some fabulous artists which I've since become fond of (ie. 'Phantom Planet', 'The Killers', & 'Imogen Heap' to name a few!) It affected me on a personal level with the story lines of family conflicts, relationships, parties, and reminded me of my high school days gone by, and every single season finale (and several episodes) seemed to cause me to bawl my eyes out they were so meaningful! Unlike other family drama shows it had the guts to show the hard topics in honest ways and from the perspective and young and old teenagers and adults and parents which made it unique! Every character was important in their own way and every character developed and dealt with their own struggles and challenges and although new ones came and went it never affected the show's story and direction! I'll admit this past season was a bit different without one of the main characters 'Marissa' who was killed off at the end of the past season but that didn't change the show as I feared it might...instead it kept it's integrity with the core characters who still reminisced and looked back fondly on her character who in a way was still there in their memory! I'm extremely pleased with how they ended the show completing everyone's story in a creative and positive way that encourages all of us in the real world to follow our dreams no matter where they might lead us! A lot of people who didn't follow the show might have thought it was cheesy but it wasn't at all! It was light hearted and silly when it needed to be to balance out the tough topics it dealt with! It came along a head of it's time perhaps and wasn't appreciated fully for it's full worth in the TV industry! I don't watch any other family dramas (I used to watch 'Once & Again' which was sadly canceled as well!) and there will never be a show that will fill the hole it's left! It was such a different show than every thing else on TV and I will sorely miss it! I feel sorry for those who may not have had the privilege of being touched by the show and it's story lines, script, acting, characters, music, etc... because it was truly a one of a kind!",2007
7,"Another season has come and gone, and, with twenty-four episodes of drama, heartbreak, and product placement to choose from, I present my ""WHO CARES?"" awards for the SECOND SEASON of ""The O.C."" Read them at your own risk, for they contain many spoilers.",2005
1,"I don't understand how this show has become so popular amongst the teenage viewing population. First of all, the actors are at least 10 years older than the characters they play. E.g. Ryan is supposed to be 17 years old or there abouts but is played by a 28 year old actor. It's just not convincing to see typical high school students looking like post-graduate university students. Perhaps Ryan, summer, seth and co. were all too stupid to graduate highschool the first time and have had to repeat for the 10th year in a row? Generally, the quality of the dialogue is shocking at least compared to deep and meaningful dialogue in dawsons creek. This show is overrated and is one of the worse i have seen. You may diagree... but to each their own!",2006
10,"The first time I heard about this show, I admit I wasn't at all interested. It looked pretty cheesy in all of the ads and promos I had seen, and I'm normally not into teen dramas. However, a close friend of mine told me she loves the show and that it's a bit deeper than I think. I decided to give the show a shot and found that she is right. If anything, I think the show is poorly advertised. The promos really don't do it justice. It's not a teenie boppery show, but actually has a lot of substance and touching moments balanced by dry wit and comic relief.",2012
10,"I originally started watching this around 2004 when season 2 was aired. I became hooked within a few episodes. My brother heard about it from a friend a few weeks previous so he decided to buy season 1. I finished the season within days. I don't really want to reveal the stories of the o.c., I just suggest that whoever reads this, buy it. It's worth every penny. This show is different to shows like One Tree Hill, Gilmore Girls, Dawson's Creek, 90210 (recent series'). The O.C. may be melodramatic, predictable, unrealistic at times and it isn't incredibly intelligent. But, this is a fun-loving show where kids just are kids. They may be weighed down by drama but they have a smile throughout. Considering the actors were quite young when this started, I have to applaud them. Adam Brody and Benjamin McKenzie really shine in all seasons. They never fail to disappoint, what with Seth's witty remarks or Ryan's 'brooding' and the little 'bromance' they have.. the o.c. makes an enjoyable show. It feels fast, but it does focus enough on the situation and it makes you really understand. Peter Gallagher, Kelly Rowan and Melinda Clarke are all brilliant as well in this. Peter plays Sandy the self-righteous surfer who trusts his instincts and is also the father of Seth and (foster parent) of Ryan. Kelly plays Kirsten the caring, hard-working rich mother of Seth and (foster parent) of Ryan. Melinda plays Julie the gold digging manipulative bitch who really does have a good heart. There are so many pros and cons to The O.C. but I say focus on the pros because this is a fantastic TV show that isn't too glitzy and unrealistic like some shows eg; one tree hill season 5 +, gossip girl. This is a fun loving show that can definitely have bucket-loads of drama but it will still have you smiling in the end up. :)",2010
9,"I read all of the, ""This show is cheesy, terrible, and cliché,"" comments and I can't help but agree with the first and third adjectives. The OC is INCREDIBLY CHEESY and INCREDIBLY Cliché. There is just no denying it. The rich kids with problems that seem like the end of the world. It's so classic that it's cliché. The big thing that makes this show great is that for every cliché and every cheesy line there is a piece of witty dialogue or an original plot point that will surprise you. For instance, you have Marissa Cooper, beautiful, rich, and an alcoholic. She is possibly the worst actress on the show and doesn't add much to the substance. Then you have her mother, Julie. She is beautiful, rich, a socialite obsessed with the good life and an Uber-B*tch extraordinaire. It's amazing how funny she makes the show and how she is able to get good acting and chemistry out of Mischa Barton (Marissa) I won't lie, it is not the greatest show on earth by any stretch of the imagination. Just don't group it together with shows like One Tree Hill and 90210 because it is better and is worth your time.",2010
10,"Okay I had prided myself of not being a teen show addict. Never watched shows like Dawsons Creek before. Never really wanted to be in that category. The only other teen shows I watch right now are Smallville-which is no longer a teen show-and Buffy, which also grows out of being a teen show and Gossip Girl, but only in a major support for Josh Schwartz who created the O.C. I'm kind of sorry to say I didn't give it a chance when it was huge. I heard people around my high school discussing it in different groups but I just sort of rolled my eyes at that, another hit teen show that's the same as all the rest. Then I watched ""Rainy Day Woman"" in season 2 and fell in love with it and finished up season 2 and rented season 1 at Blockbusters one summer.",2008
10,"This is a show I have made fun of since it's inception a few years back. The joke is on me now. I was forced to watch some episodes, and I mocked them as I watched them. Then something crazy and unpredictable happened. I was hooked. Luckily, the OC isn't an illegal substance, or I'd be in prison right now. The characters start off annoying and painfully flawed, but it doesn't matter. The acting can be corny at times, but the show is genuinely engaging and you like and hate exactly who the writers want you to. Yes, it's manipulative, but scarily addictive. I'm still asking myself why as I plow through 8 episodes in my attempt to close off season 1 in a few days. Who cares. I can't stop. This show is vastly underrated by film and TV snobs such as myself. But don't think I'll tell my friends. This is the definition of a guilty pleasure...",2008
7,"I'm not a soap-fan, and have never followed one either. I'm more into series like ""dexter, prison break and 24"".",2008
10,"well I am really gonna miss the O.C.... it had everything, drama, romance, comedy, action... i have never been into these teen series, but the O.C made an impression on me,, it was more natural then any other show i have seen... u never know what happen,, Sandy and Kirsten a match made in heaven,, Summer & Seth most fun and cute couple ever,, Ryan is loved because of his hard life.. Marissa the most beautiful girl alive, July the snake but still charming... the show had it all and more... don't think there will ever be a show like this again.... but it was right to end it on a high.... not like Beverly Hills 90210 just keeps on and on and you get bored with it......",2007
9,"I hate romantic comedies. I detest them. You can list the actors I avoid watching: Hugh Grant, Sandra Bullock, Richard Gere, Julia Roberts. Romantic comedies make me cringe and I avoid them like the plague so you can imagine the foul mood I was in when I was forced to watch this film.",2004
10,"It has been a long time since I have seen a movie so rich in character that I did not want it to end. Love Actually is not a love story, it is a story about love. Love that reinvents itself, multiplies itself, opens itself up, and even devastates.",2004
8,"What I appreciated most about Love Actually was that for the most part, it realistically looks at relationships happy and sad, successful and unsuccessful, with a future and without.  It addresses different forms and levels of love, sometimes straightforward and carefree, sometimes complex and contradictory.  There are schmaltzy happy moments and touching sad ones, moments of great strength and moments of foolish weakness.  The movie is made up of many threads, and of course some threads are stronger than others.",2003
8,"This was a lovely script, and I was surprised I hadn't heard much about this movie before I caught it on HBO. I turned it on to keep myself company while working and ended up glued to the screen. I really enjoyed it.",2004
10,"It made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me smile, hug everyone, tell everyone how much I loved them!!! I think the music is the true soul of this movie. Cheers for the director!!! So many beautiful films he's been doing for so long!!! There was no need of marvelous photography, neither splendorous costume...but every detail was placed perfectly. Excellent actors and performances. It was a very good combination of experienced ones and some others one had never seen before. I liked very much how the director showed how open minded the English people are, by the way Liam Neeson talked to Sam and some other aspects on other dialogues as well (related to sex) It is remarkable also the way they mention the American society. Not criticizing the people and the culture, buy yes the government. CONGRATULATIONS ENGLAND!!!!",2006
10,"Any picture that can have me rooting for Rowan Atkinson (who I usually detest as Bean, actually) has to be very well-crafted for my part...",2004
9,"In London, from five weeks before Christmas up to a month after Christmas, the lives of different persons are linked by love. The Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) and the member of his household, Natalie (Martine McCutcheon); his sister Karen (Emma Thompson), her husband Harry (Alam Rickman) and Harry's secretary, Mia (Heike Makatsch); Harry's employees, Sarah (Laura Linney), a woman with a serious problem in her life, and the designer Karl (Rodrigo Santoro); the writer Jamie Bennett (Colin Firth) and his Portuguese maid Aurélia (Lúcia Moniz); the grieving widow Daniel (Liam Neeson) and his son, Sam; a porn actress and her colleague; the singer Billy Mack (Billy Nighy) and his manager; the just married couple Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Juliet (Keira Knightley) and their best man Mark (Andrew Lincoln); a British young man that travels to USA, trying to score women in that country.

1,"At first I was suckered in by this movie - cool British actors like Emma Thompson, swank shots of London, the British love/hate attitude towards America.",2006
1,"I had expected from this film a relatively undistinguished, harmless little romantic comedy. What instead unfolded was two-plus hours of the most unremitting, insulting, film clichés imaginable.",2005
10,"I really didn't know they made movies like this anymore... it's been a long time since I could honestly say that here is a movie worth seeing, renting, owning. They really didn't leave anything out. They covered all their bases on this one. As a Romance Novel Reader, and as a Romance/Comedy Buff, I say I AM IMPRESSED. And I thank whoever wrote the script and hope he's a happy man, as he has made me happy every time I watch this. It made me laugh, and cry, and hope, and dream. There was love actually everywhere. Not to mention the fact that I am Portuguese and so did not need to read the subtitles to understand those beautiful scenes in Marseilles. How beautifully written this was!!! I applaud. My co-workers applaud, my family and friends to whom I recommended this movie to applaud...",2006
10,Love Actually is movie that helps you see how life redefine's it self.,2006
1,"Conclusively, without doubt, undeniably, unmistakably, unquestionably and irrevocably THE worst movie I have ever seen in my life.",2007
1,"Of course this was run on TV in these Christmassy times and I was masochistic enough to give it another go. The posters in the hate it-section have summed it all up already I know, but even I repeat them I feel the urge to share with the world what got on my nerves most: The silly Colin Firth ""love story"", Hugh Grant as PM is truly unbearable, the guy wooing his best friends wife, the VO in the beginning, I could go on forever. Question is why Rickman, Thompson and Ejiofor (screentime about two minutes) wasted their talent on this dreck. Only Nighy is fun to watch, his cynicism about his record should be applied to this sort of movie.",2007
1,"After seeing this I wanted to inflict actual bodily harm on Richard Curtis. I'm not joking. I really, really did. Love Actually is the vilest, most ghastly, most putrid film I have ever seen. It is appalling. The nadir of Curtis's output, it is a toe-curling abomination. Where to start? What about the pure, undiluted cynicism of the enterprise, evident in everything from the music to the manipulative sentimentality to the use of children to the Christmas setting. It's a film with no heart, no structure, no sense, just a series of orchestrated, contrived scenes, augmented by the odd stale comic line (eg 'Now I can only get into dresses that belonged to Pavarotti') and utterly stupid improbabilities. To go through those would take way, way too long. And what's with the use of bad language in the most inappropriate of situations? Do not see this vomit-inducing turkey of a movie, especially in a couple if you're a man because it may well end your relationship, which would actually be quite ironic, eh Mr Curtis?",2006
1,A stellar cast is drawn together for...what? For the biggest load of tripe I've had the misfortune to sit through in a long time.,2006
1,"Well now I know it's true. And I'm sad about it. British people aren't smarter or funnier than Americans. Although a higher percentage of them might be able to spell the word ""p...a...n...d...e...r"".",2005
1,"I cannot believe that anyone who likes movies enough to post or even vote on IMDb would actually like Love Actually. After peeling my mangled body from the floor of my apartment I crawled to the phone and called every movie buff I know and warned them about this foul-smelling debacle. Expecting at least good acting in a movie I knew would be a sappy British comedy, after the sixty-minute mark I begged my girlfriend to let me turn it off. I didn't even notice the misogyny until after the smoke had cleared from my head after watching two hours of bad lines, worse plot, and disastrous humor. I felt like I had been drug all over London watching stupid people doing stupider (sic) things, and drugged on a never-ending storyline that, at rare intervals, might have required a teaspoon of creativity. The portrayal of women was also completely inappropriate. It was a class struggle throughout: authoritative and powerful men and the lowly enamored women acting like they're at a Beatles concert. If you haven't seen a poorly made movie in a while, see this film. Even my girlfriend agreed that it was not at all good, and was as surprised as I was that it averaged above a 2 on the voting. You want a holiday comedy? Watch Elf. I usually don't comment on IMDb, but after seeing the 7.8 I couldn't help myself.",2004
1,"So.. is it just me or was anyone else greatly offended, if not outright appalled by everything this movie had to ""offer""? Not only was the acting simply awful with its cheesy lines and its predictable scenarios, but there were also so many different stories it made each one lose any meaning it might have had in the process. On another less general note, I was offended by the fact that Colin Firth only started to really find his Portuguese maid attractive once she stripped down to her underwear, Liam Neeson's kid, right after his own mother's funeral, claimed he wasn't distraught over her at all - it was LOVE that was tormenting him, and the comment made by the father of the Portuguese maid to his other daughter - the ""fat"" one - saying ""oh shutup, dunkin' donut 3000"".... is this supposed to be funny? Because if it is, i think i may have lost hope in humanity forever. What would possess anyone to nominate this movie for not one, but TWO golden globes? There is far more to be said about this pathetic attempt at redeeming love and people in general, however it might cause me to feel ill so i will discontinue. My overall vote? If i could give it less than a 1, i would. I am ashamed of anyone I know who has even remotely enjoyed watching ""Love, Actually.""",2005
1,"It's films like this that makes you despise what cinema has become - a manipulative medium that contrives a formula to tap into your base emotions with a painting-by-numbers banality.  Richard Curtis uses every clichéd, over-used, underdefined character from his big book of cardboard caricatures, then gets all his tired old thesp-chums to appear in it and churn out this sugar-sweet isn't-the-world-wonderful-even-when-you-think-it-isn't rubbish - and then has the audacity to stick it in the cinemas of the world and charge an entrance fee.  How long must we tolerate this self-indulgent travesty from a man who is the king of the dumbing-down rom-com.",2004
1,"One of the worst films its been my misfortune to see - I saw it for free and still wanted my money back. Smug middle class trash and one of the most manipulative films it's been my misfortune to sit through. The opening 9/11 reference was unbelievably crass and offensive and it was downhill from there. The saving grace was Laura Linney but her character just seemed to be discarded when Richard Curtis couldn't seem to contrive a way to get her back into the plot. Robert Altman and Paul Thomas Anderson have both shown how multiple storylines can be handled to amazing effect - evoking a genuine emotional response from the audience. Richard Curtis just strings together a few popular scenes from his other scripts, desperately trying to squeeze a laugh or tear from the audience. Depressingly this is one of the most successful UK films ever - despite having little or no resemblance to any London that actually exists. I think the audience's reaction will be different in hindsight when, on a second viewing, they realise they've been had.",2004
10,"Even though Avatar is of American origin, it has a lot of Japanese anime influence, particularly visually, but keeps the best of both animation cultures with it's American sense of playfulness and more realized characterization. The creators of Avatar have really crafted an artistic piece of fun and creative storytelling that is a rare gem for American TV. Avatar has strength in all the major areas of film and story, starting at ground level with an exceptionally believable world setting where war is taking place among the different nations. The main characters who find themselves caught in this struggle are three teens named Katara, Sokka, and Aang (the Avatar) who have set forth to bring harmony to the world through their influence and through the powers of the still developing Avatar. There is lot of humor and fun in this show, and you can't help but to really love these characters and their pets. But this is just the beginning of the glue that keeps you coming back. Great plots and stunning visuals are just as much of importance to the overall success of the show. The story lines are top notch, being both episodic in nature and chronologically integral from one show to the next. Each episode usually introduces a new and genuinely interesting opposition and/or characters to be overcome by the end of the show, and visually there is plenty of awe inspiring backgrounds and quality animation. With just enough well paced action, some sincere points of moral conviction (can you believe it), and witty humor makes the show a winning combination. This is entertainment for all ages, and definitely a must see.",2005
10,"Wow. I am amazed at how good this show is. The anime-style look and feel of it make it a warm addition to nick's mostly dull lineup. Don't get me wrong, nick has some good animated shows, like Spongebob, Fairly Oddparents, Danny Phantom is one of my favorites. I think that it is good that they have a program with this kind of look that isn't from an established Nickelodeon company (like frederator for fairly oddparents).",2005
10,"When I fist heard of Avatar: The Last Airbender, I was a little septic. It seemed like it would just turn out to be another cheesy, serialized anime whose only purpose is to make cash. That, and when I watched the first Avatar episode, I noticed that it wasn't a 'true' anime. Avatar is, what I call, 'hybrid' anime: in other words, anime created here in North America. This only added to my skepticism. I have had bad experiences with hybrid anime. Shows like Martin Mystery and Totally Spies are hybrids, and watching them nearly makes me gag. The anime style is chosen for no reason other than to attract audiences. Their movements are quick, jerky, and you can tell they try way to hard to mimic traditional anime style, but in that sense, they fail horribly. Their written is witless and linear (i.e: the jokes in Totally Spies all relate to some sort of stereotype of girls, like hair, nails, etc) and the plot lines are all contrived (i.e: every episode of Martin Mystery). Yet Avatar: The Last Airbender succeeded where all other 'hybrids' had failed. The anime style was chosen for artistic reasons, and each of the character's movements are very fluid, and almost reach movie quality. There are typical anime elements that give the show a surreal touch without taking it over the edge, such as Appa, the flying bison, or the Spirit World. The action scenes probably impressed me the most, as the animators focus mainly on the ensuing battle, and not so much as the reactions of the fighter's or the onlookers. Each battle has a point, as well, and not just some random duel. The character's are very well drawn out, not just in an animated-sense, but also the depth of each character. But more importantly, we see these characters evolve through their adversities, and we see how they struggle to cope with their tasks, which sometimes require them to question their morals. Again, the humour in Avatar is genuine, and always makes me laugh, whether it be a quick quip from Sako, the running joke of the Cabbage Man, or even the coincidential irony. Even it's serious moments are well written, and the character's words have a deeper meaning. One of my favourite quotes is, ""Part of being a man is knowing where you are needed"". But what impressed me the most is how deep Avatar actually goes. The show has it's own mythology that is easy to follow, but sports a deeper meaning. Each tribe or nation represents a different element, but the fire nation is the main antagonist in Avatar. Yet we gain insight as to why this is. Fire is probably the most dangerous element, as it is essentially alive, and can destroy almost anything. This give us insight into the fire nation's need for power. Yet the fire nation has its own morals too, and we occasionally see things from their side, a technique that helps us gain better understanding for the fire nation, and even creates pathos for character's like Prince Zuko. Each tribe has it's own special abilities, relating to their element, and this relationship between man and nature is a common motif that permeates through many anime movies and shows (Hayao Miyazaki's ""Princess Mononoke"" and ""Nausicaa"" are excellent examples of this). Various symbols of Chinese mythology also show up in the series (i.e: panda bear's, dragons, etc.) giving the show another level of depth. Avatar is, at its core, a story of growing up and facing fate, no matter how hard it is. I am so glad I was introduced to Avatar, and I am pleasantly surprised by its depth and wit. The voice acting fits the character's perfectly, and even the music is a joy to listen to. I would gladly recommend Avatar: The Last Airbender to practically anyone.",2006
10,Hi there.,2016
10,"This review will be very long. I adore this show with every fibre of my being, and view it to be a piece of animated perfection. I implore people to avoid the disgusting live-action adaptation by director M. Night Shyamalan, as it is a disrespectful sham that mocks everything that the show stood for and mastered.So as for the show itself, where to begin? Well let's start with the story overall. ",2014
10,"When I first saw the previews for ""Avatar"", I thought it was going to be another lame show created during a Nickelodeon slump. Boy, was I wrong. It's my favorite show on Nick, one of my favorites on all of TV. The best parts are definitely the plot line and the world that Konietzko and Dimartino have created. This is definitely one of the most complex cartoons on television.",2006
10,"According to Wikipedia, Nick considers the target demographic of Avatar to be 6-11 year-olds. As an 18 year old who has watched the entire show, and who is eagerly awaiting the next episode, I have to wonder what they are thinking. The show features a diverse array of characters, each with story, issues, and flaws. The development and maturation of the younger characters as they encounter a world in crisis and interact with each other is evident throughout the show and is well executed. The world of Avatar draws heavily from various Asian cultures to create an environment for the story that, if not entirely original, is fully realized and feels like a real place with real history and culture. The effects of elemental bending and spirit entities on the societies of Avatar are well thought-out and serve to distinguish Avatar from other Asian themed shows, giving it a unique feel (it is definitely not Anime). The creators clearly strive for realism, in both the fight scenes and in the world the characters inhabit, though blood, swearing, and graphic deaths are notably absent, since it is supposed to be a kid's show. For example, The creators consult with a martial arts expert on every episode to precisely determine how bending moves should look, based on selected real styles. Also, All writing is done in Chinese calligraphy by consultation with an expert. The people who make Avatar have managed to create a story that, while especially suitable for younger people, has elements that resonate with all age groups. Overcoming difficult situations, trusting others and yourself, the necessity of self-discipline and effort, and the value of moderation and balance are central themes in the show. I don't want to include any spoilers, so suffice it to say that the plot is compelling as well. I should also mention that the show is frequently hilarious. There is frequent use of humor, but it rarely detracts from other aspects of the show, and generally only adds to the story's quality.",2008
10,"OK, so I was 12 when this show came out and needless to say, I was completely enamored by it. For a TV station like Nickelodeon, best known for its wacky shows like SpongeBob, Rocko's Modern Life and their sitcoms like Drake and Josh, to suddenly come out with this anime-inspired animated series with deep philosophical themes as well as tackling genocide and war, this was a massive step forward.",2017
10,The series that I watched once and thought it was the greatest thing since sliced Pao (Indian bread). ,2014
10,It seems like nobody who comments on this show is willing to give credit where credit is due. Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko are the creators and executive producers of the series. Nickelodeon has nothing to do with the creative process or anything of the sort. All Nick does is air the show on their awful network and slap their annoying watermark in the bottom right corner.,2007
10,"When I first heard of this show, I was initially sceptical about it. But after following each episode, I have become progressively more interested in it and its universe. Without a doubt, this is one of the freshest shows that have ever been invented. The characters were wonderfully and fantastically fleshed out, right from its flawed and brave heroes and heroines to its sadistic and sympathetic villains.",2008
10,"When I first heard of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender,"" I was more than a little skeptic. The fact that it was airing on Nickelodeon was probably the reason I just kind of shook my head. Then about three months ago, on a complete whim, I bought the first two chapters of ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" on DVD from Barnes & Noble Booksellers and, boy, was I blown away! This is one of the most humorous, fun, action-packed, and generally all-around entertaining cartoons I've seen in the longest time. It's just a pity that shows like ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" are such a rarity these days. I'll be turning 21 on the 12th of next month; 13 years ago around this time at the age of 7, I remember that Nickelodeon had some of the best of children's programming on cable television. Then, 10 years ago, Nick began to slide into idiocy and continues to do so as I write this. Then around 1999, I gave up on Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network completely. My opinion of both channels hasn't changed. But ""Avatar: The Last Airbender,"" what I presume is an attempt to add a little pseudo-Anime'-style animation to its lineup in order to catch stragglers from other cultures (and perhaps Nick-weary adults like myself), is a breath of fresh air for this once-tired soul. While I don't think today's kids may completely understand the overall significance of some of this show's philosophy, subtext and terms (how many 5-year-olds know what an ""avatar"" is?), they may not have to be versed in Eastern Thought to get everything. ""Avatar: The Last Airbender,"" a fusion of Eastern philosophy, Hinduism and martial arts, is set in a far-off land (dare I say, a Middle-Earth clone?) where four tribes rule the world and the most gifted members of each tribe have mastery over the Four Greek Elements: Air, Earth, Fire, and Water. The mastery of each of these is the term ""bending,"" the ability to manipulate each element and use it for creative or destructive purposes. The Avatar, a sort of Christ-/Buddha-like figure, has mastery over all elements and is the most powerful bender of all. The main plot of the story gets underway when the Fire Nation grows too powerful and sets off on a campaign of world domination. But they first need the Avatar, who has mysteriously disappeared. Prince Zuko, from the Fire Nation, is leading a mission to capture the Avatar and gain re-admittance back to his kingdom. Two Water Tribe teenagers, a brother and sister named Sokka and Katara, respectively, make the discovery of a lifetime when they find that Aang, a 12-year-old Airbender who was frozen in a block of ice and also happens to be the last of his kind, is the new Avatar. But he still has many skills to master in a very short period of time, and the show follows the trio's journey to the North Pole with the mammoth six-legged bison Appa and the lemur Momo. If only more shows on Nickelodeon could follow the promise that ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" has. What boggles my mind about this cartoon is its style, which, it really has that is completely original, even though the influence of Japanese Anime' is obviously apparent. We get some fairly funny jokes here and there, way out-there philosophy, and kung-fu-style element-bending battles that are pretty hard to top; it's the single greatest piece of imagination in today's children's programming! But my praise for ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" doesn't really restore my faith in this channel (unless they wipe the slate clean and bring back all the original programs from my youthful years), it just reaffirms a hunch that they do have an ounce of competency left when it comes to entertainment.",2006
10,"Watch the series one time just for the entertainment, but then watch it again and I assure you it will change your life. It's deeper meaning and inner wisdom can genuinely change you as a person. It teaches you right from wrong, love from hate, happiness from sorrow... It's not just a show, but a guide to living a fulfilling life. Avatar: The Last Airbender is as memorable as it is beautiful. To start off, the animation is breathtaking. Play any episode and pause it at any scene and at any second and you can print it as a poster and hang it in your bedroom. Every single frame tells a story. The music and sound mix in general is also the epitome of sound in animation. Every note perfectly executed to the mood and every sound just... Works. From the individual musical themes of each character to the sounds of rushing water from a powerful water bender, the show just nails it. While on the topic of sound, the casting of the voice actors is sublime. It's hard to imagine a real life voice behind the characters, and that's what makes it great. I never hear the actor, but rather the character. Every line is delivered perfectly to distinguish the shows nature of comedy vs. drama. And when these two genres are combined (with the right execution) it creates an amazing experience for almost any audience. The story line is obviously the most important factor; without a story there is no show. The very concept is genius and the story behind the concept is simply amazing. If you haven't delved into this show yet, I would advise that you do. In an effort to not give away any spoilers, I will say that it's simply like nothing else, and you will be captivated within the first 10 minutes. By the end of season one, you will have associated yourself with one of the four elements (astronomically speaking it will be freakishly accurate) and you'll want to see how your story unfolds. Just give Avatar: The Last Airbender a chance and I promise you won't be disappointed. So good you might be inspired to get a tattoo, or at the very least... A bumper sticker that reads ""Yip Yip"".",2016
10,"It's hard to say what's so good about this show, because there are so many aspects that are done incredibly well (such as animation style, voice casting, sound engineering, music composition... There's a lot in this), but all of these pieces come together to form a show greater than the sum of their parts. It begins as a story about children initially for children, but the characters within this mature as does the subject material and range of the target audience. The tone doesn't become some cheap grim-dark escalation piece because there's always a sense of identity from the first episode to the last.",2014
10,"I started watching Avatar when I was about 7 years old, when the show began. When it was on air I would occasionally watch it, enjoying the humorous quips and fun-filled filler episodes, without really divulging into the true nature of the show. It wasn't until years after the show went off air to how I truly understood just how amazing and magnificent this show really is. The first book has its weak points, but as soon as Book 2 starts the action and anticipation picks up and goes throughout the rest of the series. I've always seen this show as Nickelodeon's Harry Potter, an enthralling series with outstanding characters and an unbelievably remarkable plot line. Anyone can learn so much from this.",2014
10,"When i first saw this show i was amazed. I forgot this was on nick. I was hooked right then and there. This shouldn't be a kids show, its way to good for that. Even the ride at Kings Island was way too scary to be a kid ride. The ride is cool and the show is out of this world. I hope it stays! The characters actually have souls, which is what i can't say for the rest of nicks characters. Everything is alive in the show. No useless humor or stupid plots. It's suspenseful and leaves you literally on your seat wanting more. Sometimes i even cheer with Aang and the gang. Sometimes i feel depressed because of Zuko. It is the best show i ever seen, and i want it to stay! GO AVATAR!",2005
9,"I believe Avatar is underapreciated because it is on Nickelodean. Since Nick is famous for its retarded shows with the same story lines just using different characters, and its rather idiotic atmosphere, Avatar doesn't belong there. I would much rather see Avatar flourish on Toonami or Diseny. You need to see Avatar, even if it is an ""Amerime"" (american anime).",2006

10,"Obviously, I'm aware of the fact that the Lord of the Rings trilogy is actually one giant movie, but since it was released in parts, that's how I'm judging them. The Return Of The King is the final chapter, and since it is the climax and resolution of the epic journey, it has a little more intensity and urgency than the previous installments.",2005
10,"Saying that this film starts where `Two Towers' left off is somewhat misleading, for the film starts a great distance from the walls of Helm's Deep. `Return of the King' opens with a flashback of Smeagol (Andy Serkis) obtaining the one ring of power and an origin of his deterioration into the creature Gollum. This opening recaptures an emphasis that was somewhat lost within the epic battles of `Two Towers,' at that's the ring. The first installment, `The Fellowship of the Ring,' provided heaps of exposition on the ring's importance and influence, and in `Return of the King,' we see it pay off, big time.",2003

A decent idea will become mangled by the money making machine that is Hollywood, hoping to pump the most raw cash they can out of it before it drops dead in the street.",2003
10,"I am, I admit, an unlikely convert to the religion of Tolkienism. I  have never read the books, having, I thought, been put off them for  life by the sort of obsessive freaks who read them when I was at  school. (One classmate, then aged about sixteen, told me with great  pride that he had read the whole of 'The Lord of the Rings' at least  fifty times). I also have never been a great admirer of the 'sword and  sorcery' school of fantasy writing or film-making; indeed, some of this  genre (mostly those starring the current governor of California) struck  me as being among the worst films ever made.  I was, however, persuaded to see the first in the trilogy, 'The  Fellowship of the Ring', by its overwhelmingly positive reception from  the critics, and was quickly won over by the scope of Peter Jackson's  vision. I had been expecting some twee tale of elves, gnomes and  fairies; what I experienced was a genuine epic (in the true sense of  that overused word). Ever since December 2001, I have been waiting for  parts two and three of the trilogy to be released. Neither has  disappointed me.  The story of 'The Lord of the Rings' is too complex to be told in a  review such as this. Suffice it to say that it revolves around a magic  ring which will give its possessor immense power. The power-hungry Dark  Lord Sauron (a figure who is never actually seen on screen) desires to  obtain the ring in order to dominate Middle Earth. His enemies, led by  the wizard Gandalf, are seeking to destroy the ring, which can only be  used for evil purposes, not for good. At the beginning of the final  part of the trilogy, Sauron's forces are massing for an attack on the  kingdom of Gondor.  The film relates the story of the conflict which follows, and this  leads to some of the most spectacular battle sequences I have seen,  even more impressive than those in 'The Two Towers'. Inevitably, the  film makes much use of computer-generated effects, but unlike many  films dominated by special effects, plot and character are not  neglected. The acting is uniformly good, and in some cases outstanding.  Special mentions must also go to the camera-work, which made the best  possible use of the magnificent New Zealand scenery, and to Howard  Shore's memorable musical score.  So, looking forward to the Oscar ceremony, I have no doubt that this  should be the best film and that Peter Jackson, who has amply fulfilled  the promise shown in the excellent 'Heavenly Creatures', should be best  director. Best Actor? I would find it difficult to decide between the  competing claims of Sir Ian McKellen, who brings wisdom, kindliness and  the required touch of steel to his portrait of Gandalf, and of Elijah  Wood, who plays the brave and resourceful hobbit Frodo to whom falls  the dangerous task of ensuring the ring's destruction. Best Supporting  Actor? My own nomination would be for Sean Astin, as Frodo's loyal  companion Sam, but several others might have claims, notably Viggo  Mortensen or Bernard Hill.  Is this the best movie ever made, as some of its admirers have claimed?  Possibly not- that is, after all, a very large claim to make. I have no  doubt, however, that the trilogy as a whole is the first great  cinematic masterpiece of the twenty-first century. It has certainly  inspired me to start reading Tolkien's original novels. 10/10.",2004

I had taken refreshments but barely touched them - probably because the film I had watched is one of the most mesmerising, evocative, inspiring, and awesome I have witnessed of any big adventure epic. Not to mention superb ensemble acting, moods that shift effortlessly between mediaeval battles of colossal proportions and convincing bloodshed, beauty and wonderment, fantastic natural and artificial landscapes and cityscapes, touches of humour, well-paced dramatic tension, and human bonding that is moving enough to just let you dry your eyes as the unassuming credits flash by.",2003

For it is a landmark event in cinema history based on its sheer size and careful attention, praise and evisceration apart. The issue that greatly irritates me and pushes me to write is that many of the negative reviewers on this website have such limited room in their imagination that they cannot conceive of a world outside their own narrow framework.

But only the actual release of the movie an agonising year after The Two Towers would remove this uncertainty, and fulfill my desire to see on the big screen the end of one of the great stories.

Then the Richard Pryor Show shook people to the bone. From these gems came further explorations of the comic genre. We were treated to things like The Simpsons, Married With Children, and Seinfeld. Shows that broke the mold of the typical sitcom formula. They found their actors and made them stars.

Your one seat seems to be the only constant on this engine of turmoil and destruction. And you can't. Stop. Watching. By the last 3 hours of this you have completely forgotten about the slow and subtly boring start. You remember that in order for their to be a payoff, there has to be a set up. And it's at about this time that you stop panicking about the series being ruined and the 4th season being a failure. You finally get to appreciate all the set ups, all the subtleties, and you hold on for your life as the story comes to it's highest points.

Michael, a widower, is the only one with a job; he runs the Bluth Company in his father's absence in his own compulsive way, and is constantly thwarted in comedic ways by his family. Michael's older brother Gob (Will Arnett) is a magician - sorry, an ILLUSIONIST, who takes himself very seriously. Unfortunately for him, nobody else does. His botched attempts at performing his illusions are always hilarious, and always preceded by one version or another of the opening melody of Europe's ""The Final Countdown"". Michael's younger brother, Buster (Tony Hale), is a 30-ish mama's boy. He is socially awkward to the point that he fits the profile of a serial killer. Buster has no job, instead going to school after school to pursue various interests as strange and unrelated as Native American drumming and cartography. In the pilot episode he mistakenly identifies the blue area on a world map as the land. Lindsay (Portia de Rossi) is Michael's twin sister, an extremely vain, self-centered and sexually frustrated woman whose loveless marriage to Tobias Funke (David Cross), a frequently unemployed ex-psychiatrist/wannabe actor, is precariously balanced, to say the least. Tobias is a ""never-nude"" who wears cut-off jean shorts into the shower. Needless to say, this puts a strain on their sex life, and the couple are never happy; always in one form or another of therapy, or trying an ""open relationship"" and racing to entice members of the opposite sex into trysts that, for one reason or another, never work out. Lucille Bluth (Jessica Walter) is the matriarch of the Bluth family. She is rarely seen without a drink in her hand, and her biting wit and cruel barbs toward her children are doled out relentlessly. She is shrewd and manipulative, Michael has to work hard to stay ahead of the various plots and scams she is always concocting, which usually center around money and keeping her public image up to par. Michael has a son named George Michael (Michael Cera) who is studious and naive. He is wholesome and quite awkward, constantly striving for the approval of his busy father with his intense work ethic, and trying his best to suppress his lust for his cousin, Maeby (Alia Shawkat), the trouble-making daughter of Lindsay and Tobias.",2007

10,"Furthermore, an even worse decision was show writer Mr. H's refusal to stay on so that the show could be picked up by Showtime. I was willing to buy Showtime just for this show. This show was a breath of fresh air among cookie-cutter sitcoms, mind numbing reality shows and overdone law/medical/forensics shows. Who are these people with the Neilson boxes and what are they thinking? How many Law & Order and CSI spin-offs/ clones are they going to make? I hated the originals! Reality shows lower your IQ by two points with each episode, and very few sitcoms are truly funny or original anymore. This was one of the few. The writing, direction, production, acting, and every aspect down to the music and camera-work were all top notch. Despite FOX's lack of advertising, this show won 6 Emmys on its first season. I didn't even know about the show until Season 2 was out on DVD. I bought Season 1 based on word of mouth (and immediately went out and purchased Season 2 after watching only four episodes of Season 1). I wondered how I had not heard about such a brilliant show through 2 whole seasons. It was as if FOX wanted it to fail. I learned FOX kept cutting the seasons short and bounced its scheduling around putting it in the line up against other networks power shows- it even put it up against Monday Night Football- then wondered why the ratings were poor? This show was destined to be another 'Cheers', a show that had poor ratings during its first seasons then went on to become one of the longest running hits of all times. It makes me want to cry that such a truly genius show won't continue. I purchased Season 3 on DVD and watched the entire two-disk set, all the extras and episodes with commentaries a second time in one sitting. This show is that good! The clerk at the store from which I purchased the DVD even commented on what a smart purchase I was making, and then we discussed how saddened we were that it was canceled. I pray DVD sales will force FOX or Mr. H to reconsider, and if there is a God, he will bring this show back from the dead.",2006
10,"Few things are funnier than really smart people acting really silly, and that pretty describes everyone involved with Arrested Development, from the cast and writers down to the cameramen and editors. It's a show that contains some very witty, complicated and obscure humor but also gleefully dives into slapstick, goofy visual gags and general absurdity. Rather than feeling like a clash of different comedic styles however, the different elements mesh into a completely unique brand of humor. It may take a few episodes for you to get into the tone of the show and learn the quirks of all the individual characters but once you do the laughs are pretty much nonstop.",2006

9,"In the wake of the ""Enron"" scandal and others like it, but before the giant banking crash of 2008, it was amazing that such an unfunny subject could be made so hilarious. The Bluth family, in spite of the advertising to the contrary, has hardly ""lost everything"". What they have lost is the ability to charge their personal living expenses to the company after the company founder and head of the family, George Bluth, is arrested and charged with embezzlement and fraud. They still have one poorly constructed model home - with nothing but sand surrounding it - plus the Bluth Development company, which actually is a legitimate business, it just hasn't been run that way up until now. They also have Michael, the only family member with a conscience and a work ethic, who works to keep the family and the company together in his father's absence. However, for the spoiled Bluths, losing access to the company jet and cars, having their country club membership downgraded to a pool membership, and having to share the roomy yet shoddily constructed model home as living quarters has them all acting like they're stranded on Gilligan's Island.",2017

Some episodes have incredible and beautiful stories, that reminds movies like ""stand by me"" or the first episodes of dawson's creek, it's that kind of innocence and at the same time deep drama where the whole cast make a terrific(unforgettable) work.

7,"Normally, I just scoff at shows of this nature, but I happened to watch the pilot episode while working on a project because the TV was already on the WB channel from the previous show. Next thing you know I was wrapped up in this show, which seems to be the best of the genre. For once, this is one that doesn't borrow from 90210 or My So Called Life, yet seems to make its own direction. Sure, it is still has the cliches...28 year old, socially evolved high school students with attractive 32 year old parents, but once you get over this, the show really shines! I hope it has a future, although I doubt it will last very long since the OC is getting all of the buzz simultaneously.",2004
10,"When the show was first going to air, four years ago, I wasn't too excited about it. I started watching the show and completely fell in love with the characters ans the actors themselves. They storyline is great, they deal with real issues and have very lovable people. I have seen every episode now and love them all, though for a short time in the second season I thought it got a little dull with the Felix/Anna characters. The show has been compared to the o.c. but I think that it is different just by one major detail, the setting. They are in a relatively small town with not too many money issues and not too many problems with people being fake and using each other too be famous. It's truly about their relationships as people whether it's a boyfriend/girlfriend, father/son, friend/friend relationship, it shows how they all interact and feel. There have been many comments about the fact that they are sort-of stereotyped characters, but I feel they did that on purpose, that as time went on, they showed that there is more to them, more to anyone, than just what your first impression is. It's showing that people all act and react certain and very different ways to the many situations they are faced with on the show. Ever since (and including) the episode dealing with a school shooting mid-third season, they show that everyone is unifying and that they all are becoming closer. I can't wait to see the fifth season, which will be set four years after high-school when you will see them with careers and families!",2007
10,"One Tree Hill came on about the same time as The O.C came on, but the two shows couldn't be more different, and besides the fact that O.C attracts a larger audience, One Tree Hill is the better show. First of all, it has better actors. All the young leads are confident and convincing in their roles, and there is seldom a ""false"" moment on the show (as compared to The O.C, whose cast includes both the horrible mumblings of Mischa Barton and the horrible wooden acting of Benjamin McKenzie). The cast of One Tree Hill is of course helped immensely by the fact that their characters are so well written; they are people the audience really cares for, and takes an active interest in (as demonstrated on the multiple fan sites and message boards dedicated to the ""Naley""-relationship and the ""Lucas-Peyton-Brooke""-triangle.",2006
10,"I'm a big fan of the O.C and never for a second believed that One tree hill could be as good as it. But I was wrong. One tree hill is better than the O.C. At least in my opinion. Sure, O.C is a good teen show with the usual ""teen drama"" problems and also with a lot of humor. But what is it the that makes One tree hill better? I think that One tree hill basically has a better story to tell than the one in O.C. Although One tree hill may lack some of the humor that's in the O.C, it's a much more interesting show to watch. The characters are so much more intriguing and has much more depth than the characters in O.C. And then One tree hill doesn't have this obsession with DRAMA... The events unfold in a realistic way and the show just have a slower pace. Although I may add that I've just seen about half of the first season... So I might be taking all of this back in a while... But for now I'll just say that I love this show and everyone ought to give it a chance.",2006

That was before I really got to know it and figured that there was more to the heart of this show than showing the high-life of being an American teenager and living the dream. It's about love - love of basketball, love of families, love of friends, love of lovers, love of life.",2006

10,"I have to say, from the first episode I watched I fell in love with this show. You feel so happy at one moment and then you cry on another. This show has things that every teenager can relate to. People think it's stupid because of the whole basketball-cheerleader thing, but I think one reason the show is good is because of that. People can relate to this show because these people don't have a ton of money and live in mansions like on The O.C. I really recommend you watch this show because it has one of the best plots for a show that you could ever have and I believe it really has meaning. I really hope they keep making more seasons. Watch this show. If you think it looks stupid give it a chance and you will see that this has to be the one of the best shows ever made.

I've been watching OTH over in the UK every Saturday on channel 4's T4 slot. It took a while to grow on me but now I love it. This show deals with all kinds of issues and it has real drama that really appeals to anyone. I really like Brooke she's really really grown on me at first I thought she was really annoying and I didn't like her but now she's great we've got to see a warm and caring side to her it was when Lucas was in hospital after the car crash and we really got to see the real Brooke. She's since found out about Lucas and Peyton seeing each other behind her back and now she's really hurt and feels betrayed by them. She may have her moments when she says stupid things at the wrong time but Brooke is a fun wild and fantastic friend who we all wouldn't mind having around. The entire cast are all brilliant in their roles Craig Sheffer, Moira Kelly, Chad Murray Michael, Sophia Bush, and co are outstanding. One of the best teen American shows I've seen in a while since The OC. I love this show and I'm really pleased to see that OTH is in its second season already and I think that's great. I hope many more keep coming to our screens to keep us fans coming back for more.",2005

9,"Well i have started to watch one tree hill and i have to say that it is incredible! the actors(chad Michael Murray, James Lafferty, Hilarie Burton, Bethany joy Lenz, Sophia bush) are extraordinary! In the show two brothers from different worlds have to learn how to play as a team when Lucas Scott(chad Michael Murray) joins the ravens basketball team where his half brother Nathan Scott(James Lafferty) plays on. Lucas and James were never close and despised each other since Lucas's father, Dan Scott, abandoned him to be with his other son Nathan. Lucas who lives with his mom, Karen, is poor and the only person that is similar to him as a father is Keith Scott(Dans brother. The only things that Nathan and Lucas have in common is that they both love basketball, they are from the same father, and they both love/like Peyton(Hilarie Burton)(Nathans girlfriend). Nathan and Peyton don't share a close relationship, the only thing they usually do is fight and make-out. Once Peyton sees how Nathan treats Lucas once he joins the Ravens basketball team, she breaks up with him. Peyton and Lucas then kiss when Brooke(Sophia bush), Peyton's best friend) dares her to kiss Lucas....soon after Lucas and Peyton find a room and plan to have sex until Lucas gets into a deep conversation on how he doesn't only want to sleep with her but to be with her. Peyton then bails and feels bad for what she has done. A couple days later she goes to tell Lucas how she feels when she finds out that Lucas is dating Brooke. Peyton talks to Haley(Bethany joy lenz) who is Lucas's best friend and Nathans new girlfriend, on what she should do. Peyton gets confused on her advice...? Peyton finds out that her father may be dead and when she and Lucas go to see if he really is dead. Peyton kisses Lucas, knowing that he is dating her best friend Brooke, soon afterward Peyton tells Lucas to just forget about.

The cartoon sequences seemed a bit much, but did fit in with the overall feel of the film. I have seen many people posting about the sheer amount of blood and guts, but you have to remember this was Tarantino's homage to Bruce Lee-era action pictures. In those movies, the stories were very similar epics of revenge, and they never had much of a budget for good ""gore"" effects. It was more or less ""throw some fake blood on the guy who just got killed"" type of effects, which were duplicated accurately by some of the deaths in this movie. The plot also followed closely the plot of most 70's Kung Fu movies; something despicable happens to the weak hero (whole village razed, family slaughtered, etc..) and the hero goes away for years to learn the secrets of a particular style of Kung Fu. All of these movies contained the ""secret move"" which the master normally does not teach, except of course, in this rare instance. That move, as depicted in Kill Bill Vol. 2, is always used on the evil leader of the clan whom had brought death and chaos to the hero.",2005

Some of the shots are simply incredible; the score is, for the most part, vintage Tarantino selections- and the RZA does a very good job at filling the blanks; Uma Thurman is a great female lead, for sheer presence (and decent acting chops).

Even more interesting is the apparent split between fans of Volumes 1 and 2. Like the thread says, I think most of it's a matter of those who prefer style to substance. For my past, Volume 1 destroys Volume 2, but I concede that everyone has their own tastes and experiences and that no one pinion has any more weight than the other. Two scenes in particular really make this movie brilliant in my opinion, and both are fairly subtle in their portrayal but fascinating by their tone and the cinematic elements that come together to carry them off:",2004

And Kill Bill Vol 1 is no exception. Tarantino choreographed the fight scenes in this film and when an expert fight choreographer was hired to assist Tarantino, he saw the fight sequences said his assistance was not required. The dialogue is fantastic as with any Tarantino film. He is a genius with words. While e not his best screenplay, it's very much enjoyable. The best thing about this film however is Uma Thurman's lead performance. In perhaps her finest moment Thurman steals every scene she's in. She adds depth to this already complex character. However, the supporting acting in this film is also outstanding with Lucy Liu at her best and Vivica A Fox giving an electrifying performance Overall a fantastic film",2017

This type of movie (Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon clone) is getting really old and I wish other moviegoers would start to agree. I really can't think of too much I liked about this movie other than one side character who was particularily interesting.

I even had TiVo-ed Vol. 2 of the series, but if its anything like the first volume, I don't want anything to do with it. Sure there are plenty of violent movies, but this is just plain gross.

10,"I have now seen Mr. Tommy Wiseau's cinematic tour-de-force, 'The Room'  three times. With each viewing, 'The Room' becomes more complexly  entangled in and inseparable from my own life. I no longer know where  The Room ends and I begin.  It is, without question, the worst film ever made. But this comment is in no way meant to be discouraging.  Because while The Room is the worst movie ever made it is also the  greatest way to spend a blisteringly fast 100 minutes in the dark.  Simply put, 'The Room' will change your life.  It's not just the dreadful acting or the sub-normal screenplay or the  bewildering direction or the musical score so soaked in melodrama that  you will throw up on yourself or the lunatic-making cinematography; no,  there is something so magically wrong with this movie that it can only  be the product of divine intervention. If you took the greatest  filmmakers in history and gave them all the task of purposefully  creating a film as spectacularly horrible as this not one of them, with  all their knowledge and skill, could make anything that could even be  considered as a contender. Not one line or scene would rival any moment  in The Room.  The centerpiece of this filmic holocaust is Mr. Tommy Wiseau himself.  Without him, it would still be the worst movie ever made, but with him  it is the greatest worst movie ever made. Tommy has been described as a  Cajun, a Croatian cyborg, possibly from Belgium, clearly a product of  Denmark, or maybe even not from this world or dimension. All of these  things are true at any one moment. He is a tantalizing mystery stuffed  inside an enigma wrapped in bacon and smothered in cheese. You will  fall in love with this man even as you are repelled by him from the  first moment he steps onto screen with his long Louis the Fourteenth  style black locks and thick triangular shoulders packed into an oddly  fitting suit, and his metallic steroid destroyed skin. Tommy looks out  of place, out of time and out of this world. There has never been  anything else like him. Nor will there ever be.  The Room begins with 'Johnny' (Tommy Wiseau) and his incomprehensibly  evil fiancée 'Lisa' (played by a woman with incongruously colored  eyebrows and a propensity for removing her shirt) engaging in some  light frottage, joined by, Denny, (played with a deft sense of the  absurd by Phillip Haldiman), their sexually confused teenage neighbor  who is clearly suffering from a form of aged decrepitude. When Denny,  who looks like the human version of Gleek the monkey from Superfriends,  says, in a slightly creepy yet playful tone of voice, 'I like to  watch!' as Johnny and Lisa roll around the bed in a pre-intercourse  ritual revolving around rose petals, you know you are in for a very  special movie.  After a lengthy lovemaking scene (not to worry if you miss it the first  time, they show it again in its entirety later in the movie) in which  Tommy's bizarre scaly torso and over-anatomized rear-end are lovingly  depicted over and over again as he appears to hump Lisa's hip, we  discover that Lisa, for no particular reason, has become bored with  Tommy's incessant lovemaking and decides to leave him.  Just when you think the movie might lapse into an ordinary, pedestrian  sort of badness, Johnny's best friend Mark, a man who's job seems to be  to wear James Brolin's beard from Amityville Horror, shows up and  electrifies the screen with a performance so wooden that it belongs in  the lumber section of Home Depot. Incidentally, Mark is played by Greg  Sestero, who, in addition to being described as a department store  mannequin, was also the line producer on 'The Room' and one of Tommy  Wiseau's five (5!!!!!) assistants on the movie. Lisa forces Mark, amid  his paltry, unconvincing protests, to have an affair with her on their  uncomfortable circular stairs. For no apparent reason Lisa decides that  she is made of pure evil and wants to torture her angelic and insanely  devoted fiancé, Johnny.  Lisa receives pointed advice from her mother who casually announces  that she is dying of breast cancer and then never mentions it again.  But Lisa is determined to make Johnny's life a living hell, in spite of  the fact that she, according to her mother, ""cannot survive on her own  in the cutthroat 'computer business'"". But not before they recycle the  sex scene from earlier in the movie where we get another bird's eye  view of Johnny's ludicrous naked body. Denny gets into trouble with a  drug dealer. Mark shaves his beard. Tommy gets drunk on an unusual  cocktail made from mixing whiskey and vodka. Lisa lies and tells  everyone that Tommy hit her in a drunken rage.  A balding psychologist appears out of nowhere, offers some advice, then  apparently dies while softly falling on the ground in an attempt to  catch a football thrown by Mark.  All of these seemingly disparate events build up to two cathartic  moments. The first is when Tommy expressively yells at Lisa with the  line 'You are tearing me apart Lisa!'. You will cheer at this line as  you realize that the film has been tearing you apart the whole time.  And the second is at Tommy's birthday party where the worst actor that  has ever been born plays a unidentified man wearing a silk shirt who  utters a phrase that perfectly describes the experience of watching The  Room,  'It feels like I'm sitting on atom bomb that is going to explode!'  The shocking ending will leave you pleading for some kind of sequel.  See this film at all costs. See it twice. Or three times. Or as one kid  that I met from Woodland Hills has, 12 times! See it until you can  recite every precious line of dialogue this movie has to offer. Let The  Room become your new religion and Tommy Wiseau your prophet preaching  the gospel according to Johnny.  My dream is to someday buy a theater and run The Room 24 hours a day, 7  days a week until the print disintegrates. I hope it becomes your dream  as well.",2004
1,"You know that foreign exchange student from high school who used to creep out all the girls with his clumsy leering and broken-English pick-up lines? Well, he's all grown up and somebody gave him money to make a film. Tommy Wiseau, whose accent could best be described as ""half-drunk Croatian cyborg"", stars as Johnny, the man with the most sculpted ass in all of San Francisco. His girlfriend Lisa, played by oft-topless Juliette Danielle, seduces his best friend, played by department store mannequin Greg Sestero. To go any farther with the plot would be overdignifying this laugh-out-loud crapfest. Imagine a two-hour episode of ""Red Shoe Diaries"" written and directed by Balki from ""Perfect Strangers"". Trust me, this is the worst movie you will ever see ever in your entire life. Ever. But is it pathetically awful or sadistically hilarious? What you think will depend on your life experiences and viewpoint. But we can all agree, it's a big, steaming nut-filled turd.",2003
1,"Forget all the three-line raves this movie has received (which all seem to be suspiciously similar in tone). THE ROOM is one of those rare laugh-riots that is so fantastically inept as to border on genius.

1,"I've never in my life been more entertained by a film that has absolutely NO redeeming qualities. Unintentionally inept characters engage in progressively bizarre and unnatural interactions which seem to peak at erratic and unexpected intervals. The awkwardness of the actors is framed by strange pauses, jarring scripts and incredibly bizarre production techniques - there are ample 'deer in the headlights' moments, in which you can feel genuine sympathy for these people who are obviously so caught up in Tommy's strange and dominating creative control that they've failed to see any better.",2010
1,"Johnny, a man thanks to whom a bank makes lots of money, did not get his promotion but he's way too busy trying to be American by throwing footballs around at any given opportunity to really mind that. And he's also about to get married to Lisa who's in some computer business of some kind but she's having an affair with Mark, Johnny's best friend, who does not want to hurt Johnny but clearly can't help himself. Danny, Johnny and Lisa's young sexually confused neighbour who has problems of his own somewhat related to drugs and football fetching, doesn't suspect a thing although he's always hovering about and is also in love with Lisa but would rather watch Lisa and Johnny in bed when he's not fetching Johnny's balls. The only person who knows what is afoot between Johnny and Lisa is Lisa's mother who begs her daughter to come to her senses but in vain since no one listens to her and... she's dying... since she DEFINITELY has breast cancer (which is okay since ""they're curing people everyday""). Confused? Well don't be...",2013
1,"Oh, wow, um, where do I even begin with this movie? I suppose I could tell you how I heard of it, like most people I heard about this movie from an internet reviewer(the Nostalgia Critic). I honestly would've never heard of this film either, probably would have never seen it. But after the clips I saw, I HAD to see this movie, I went on Amazon.com immediately afterwards and ordered it. Now I knew this movie was going to be bad, but I HAD NO IDEA! I think it's one of those movies that had to be handled in clips because I cannot tell you all the safety precautions you should take before watching this movie. My boyfriend tried to commit suicide while I just wanted to find Tommy Wiseau and do some things that even the Dark One would look at me and say ""geez, take it easy on the guy"". I cannot even describe how this movie is bad. The acting is like the actors are literally reading the script for the first time. Tommy Wiseau's acting, I don't know if there's a word for how bad it is so we'll just say it's ""aguwaba"", also it seems his voice was dubbed over. Now I thought this was because maybe he only speaks one language that isn't English, but he speaks with this stupid indefinable accent all the time, so why is his dubbing the same way? Where is he from? Brazil, Romania, France? I have no idea.",2010
10,"""The Room"", more aptly titled ""Inconsistancy: The Laughably Pitiful Time Machine"", left me feeling more conflicted than ever before. On the one hand, this is clearly the worst movie ever made.  Tommy Wiseau must be a billionaire, because I have no idea who in their right mind would fund this project.  The acting is horrific, the plot drops its incomprehensible tangents about as abruptly as they are surfaced, half of the film is composed of sex scenes (one recycled, by the way), and the dialogue is the most unnatural I've ever heard... it's a joke.  And speaking of jokes, all these qualities make ""The Room"" one of the most fun films I have seen in a long, long time.  I loved it - it's absolutely destined to be a cult classic.  While watching this adorable attempt at capturing reality, I couldn't help but long for the return of MST 3K so they could have a crack at this thing.  Fortunately, the audience picked up on my vibes and shouted out jokes and comments sufficient enough for my yearning.  I would recommend that every person in the world find a way to see this film because it will leave you feeling that much better about yourself.  I mean that sincerely. So long as you have a great sense of humor and don't mind that the characters' only motivation for action is simply their ill-explained personality traits, I guarantee explosive laughter throughout the surprisingly quick hundred minutes.  It's like nothing I have ever experienced before.  Wiseau's character delivers the line at one point, ""You're tearing me apart!!""  My sentiments exactly.  10 stars.",2003
10,"If anyone actually watched this movie and walked out with just the notion that it was a ""bad movie"" they have absolutely no sense of humor... This movie is not a ""bad movie,"" it is by far the worst movie ever made, and absolutely hilarious... It's not like bad movie hilarious where there's some really funny parts (funny for being bad) and the rest is boring... It's absolutely non-stop... My mouth dropped open and literally stayed that way for most of the movie... The sex scene, the completely nonsense drug dealer side story, the dialogue (""Hi, Doggy""), and best of all were Mark's attempts to stop Lisa from having sex with him (""hey... wait a minute... what are you doing... no, we can't do that"")... I'm just happy I got a chance to see it, especially with a crowd of people that also ""got it"" ... I can't wait for the DVD...",2004
10,"There's a special category of films. The 'so bad it's good' category. Films created with the best intentions that ended up so bad that they cross the line of their genres and move to the comedy section. Well the Room is the king of all these films. Written, directed and produced by that alien life form our world known as Tommy Wiseau, the Room tells the story of Johnny a banker who loves his Lisa so much and he's happy that has Mark as his best friend. Lisa by the way is an average looking chubby woman that in the Room's universe is hotter than Megan Fox. Mark is a model looking man that will not hesitate throwing you off the roof and apologize some seconds later. There's also Denny a neighbor/son/retarded weirdo that likes to watch people having sex. There's also Claudette, Lisa's mother who's dying of breast cancer. Other characters you ask? Well we have Chris R. who sells drugs to kids before getting paid, Mike and Michelle, two chocolate lovers (I mean that literally), Peter a psychologist who transforms into Steven and a dog that looks like a frog. Confused? Don't be. Everything makes sense in Tommy's mind.",2012
10,"I can't believe as a fan of so bad they're good movies that it took me this long to see The Room. After watching the first few scenes of this film, my head was already shaking so much my neck started to hurt. At the same time it was impossible for me not to crack a smile. This film has the best worst acting I've ever witnessed. The star/director/producer/writer Tommy Wiseau should be in the Hall of Fame of bad acting if there ever was one. I'd describe him as a cross between Christopher Walken and Fabio, except he makes Fabio look like Daniel Day Lewis when it comes to his acting skills. It's not just Tommy who lacks in the acting department. Every single actor/actress in this film will make you want to cringe with every line. It doesn't help the already dreadful actors that the dialogue is absolutely atrocious.",2013
10,"Even if ""The Room"" isn't the most technically polished, sharply-acted, or most coherently-plotted film in the history of cinema, I challenge you to find another movie that will give you as much pure pleasure. Anyone who has attended the midnight screenings at the Laemmle's Theater on Sunset in Hollywood knows what I'm talking about. I don't think I've ever laughed as hard at a movie in my entire life. Some very competent filmmakers struggle their entire careers and never make a movie one-tenth as enjoyable as ""The Room"". We should all thank Tommy Wiseau for this little gem that has brightened up so many lives. If you have any friends who are suffering from depression, I recommend you bring them to a screening of ""The Room"" immediately. They'll thank you for it. I'm eagerly looking forward to Mr. Wiseau's future work.",2008
10,"Perhaps the best testament to the greatness of ""The Room"" is its utter indescribability, its curiously strong resistance to mimetic, second-hand description. Sure, you can easily sum up the banal, cliché plot, or approximate the mind-bogglingly amateurish acting and the hole filled, insanely convoluted, and just plain weird screenplay. You'll make yourself laugh as you quote choice lines (""Hi Doggy!"" ""I feel like I'm sitting on an atom bomb that's about to explode!"" ""The world would be a better place if everyone loved each other."" ""Oh hi _______!"" ""Chocolate is the symbol of love."" ""Cheep cheep cheep!"" et al) and mime Wiseau's hilariously awkward motions and slurred cadences (""It's not true, I did not hit her! I DID NOOOOT.""). You'll try in vain to convey the sheer weirdness of the incessant football playing, the hilarity of the jogging at the park, the brilliance of Chris R., the beautiful blue-screened rooftop, the horrific sex scenes that never seem to end, the mantra-like, gut-wrenchingly saccharine pop songs that accompany said sex scenes, and the inescapable, mind-erasing voids of Lisa and Claudette's mother-daughter one-on-one's. However, frustratingly for the would-be promoter of the film, these sorts of descriptions do little in the way of actually capturing the genuine magic that occurs when one sees ""The Room"" for the first time.",2006

1,"So it is almost a year now since the premiere of ""The Room"". Possibly one of the boldest independent movies of the week, it lived up to the rumors. A French Canadian friend of mine named Michael first told me and my brother of this masterpiece. At first I was scared when I was told it was a movie about a man who could barely speak English and was struggling to keep his girlfriend, but there was so much more. There were roses....spoons....and Denny. Tommy Wiseau, possibly the greatest independent,new,director/writer/producer named Tommy to come from Europe in the past year...bar none. Some people have compared him to Tennesse Williams, and I couldn't agree more...his acting is probably the closest I've seen to him since Philip Haldiman. The symbolic usage of spoons in this movie makes me love it even more. The cutaways to the fabulous bridge brings a horrifying yet satisfying theme to this already quirky yet serious yet pornographic movie. I cannot wait to see what movie Tommy decides to do next, personally I don't think he can top this one....but maybe a sequel is in order to this great trilogy or saga of movies to ""The Room""...possibly Denny spin-offs. Actors Awesome, Actresses = Worst I've seen in my entire life. Good Work Tommy...we need more filmmakers like you producing your own movies. The Room = 4 spoons out of 4",2004
10,"This movie is great. So complex, so intricate, so layered. A buddy of mine and myself could spend hours talking about this movie, trying to figure it out. We've both watched it multiple times and we're both not satisfied. You thought the scene changes in Memento where confusing? Try The Room. You find yourself always wondering what the heck is going on. That's especially true when the actors are talking. Who wrote this stuff? Tommy Wiseau is who wrote this, youngin'. Get to know him. Seriously. Wiseau not only made this movie, he MAKES this movie. Without Wiseau, you'd be wondering what the hell you're wasting your time for. With Wiseau, somehow the movie makes perfect sense, in a not making sense at all sort of way. Why is he always laughing? Is he nervous on the set? Is this the character of Johnny coming through? Who knows. This is why this movie is so great, it leaves you with so many questions. For instance, in the drunk scene, you find yourself bewildered as to the reason Lisa and Johnny choose to drink what could only be described as Vodka over Whiskey. And then Johnny confirms that the drink ""Isss goood"". How is that possible? You were confused by the time lapses in Primer? You ain't seen nothing. The Room not only has time issues, but it has missing scenes and sudden changes of behavior by the characters. A simple filler shot of San Francisco (Whenever you see Alcatraz, I recommend shouting ALCATRAZ!!!!!) can mean anything from, ""Well, it appears an entire day has passed""... to ""Well, I think it's the same day""... or ""Why did I just see that?"".",2006
10,"If the room had to be described in one word it would be, Breathtaking. The room is filled with non-stop, edge of your seat, nail biting action. The visionary Tommy Wiseau should go down in history as the greatest writer, producer and director of all time. The film will take you on an emotional roller-coaster that you'll be strapped in for till the end. You really begin to feel for Johnny as Lisa betrays him for his best friend Mark. The dialogue is just so moving. When Johnny tells the viewers that Lisa is tearing him apart you can't help but feel torn up inside. The poor man had everything with Lisa, without her, he has nothing. It also has its way about dealing with drugs and other problems such as cancer. The ending will leave you crying and wanting more. Just remember, don't watch this and ""for all I care, you can drop off the earth, Thats a promise""- Mark (Greg Sestero)",2014

Why would a stranger buy Charlies beach house and allow Alan, Jake AND Berta to stay???????? The question of why lingers, the quality of the show has taken a huge hit. Ashton Kutcher just plain doesn't fit, it's like taking a jigsaw puzzle piece that doesn't fit and trying to jam it into place, it won't work, and neither will Mr Kutcher. My wife and I have watched this series from day one.....that all stops now. It seems that Mr Lorre has lost his way, sure Charlie Sheen was a pain in the proverbial a....you know, but he was a vital piece to the puzzle, Mr Lorre should suck it up and bring him back.

If they had simply traded actors and kept the writing it would have been excellent, but does anyone else get the feeling that the writers left with sheen? Or it might be the fact that Charlie knew how to act in TV shows as where kutcher... well come to think of it where was he a good actor because in all the movies I remember him in he's always this really dumb guy who just walks around clueless. Perhaps he figured that would work on shows too, it didn't.

Throughout middle school, high school, and into my college years, I knew that every Monday night at 9PM I could sit down, relax, and watch one of my favorite TV shows.

So the only people that lose here are the cast and the only winner is no one because we lose a good show. Ask Charlie really nice to come back and maybe you will get back your good reviews.

Charlie's character being more degraded which the producers wanted...well they won but now the future of the show is uncertain...you win guys...but what about the other man and a half ? !",2011

Oh come on, Charlie deserved at least few tears (you Mr producer own this your audience !!!) From the bottom of his heart, Charlie was a good person. And then a new character came. A grown man who acts like a child. This is not funny. It's irritating. First 4-5 episodes were a disaster, then it started to be a little better but overall, the show lost all the chemistry which was between Charlie, Alan, Jake, Berta + Charlie & Alan's mother.

Not only, the actor is not very talented, not funny nor the character is interesting, but also has the huge job of filling Sheen's shoes. Let's be honest, the show is nothing without Charlie Sheen. OK, Jake and Alan are also great characters. But the thing about this show was the issues between the two brothers and their trouble raising a kid. It makes no sense to change the main character. They should have cancelled it. No doubt the Charlie-Alan-Jake seasons are fantastic. But that is it. Forget that someone even tried to make episodes without one of those three. It's better to remember it as good show, as it was.",2013

Bad transition, Ryan is a WAAY better comedian than Ashton will ever be and he already had a position in the show. Should continue along the same storyline rather than write a new show. This to me is an obvious move, why could no one else see this?

This show now is dead to me. I'd rather watch the former 8 seasons again and again. I like Charlie, Rose, little Jake, Berta and Evelyn in the show. At first I think this show is just for fun. But as I watch more, I realize that there are a lot of other things that I like which can make people stop to think. Charlie seems to be womanizing and nonchalant to his mother and brother at first. Yet I see a loving Charlie when Evelyn is vulnerable, when he comes into Jake's room to find the sulking Jake who is hiding in his room just because Charlie threatens Alan to move out. Rose loves Charlie so much and she is a good girl. So funny to see her head popping out from the deck. .... This show, S1-S8, is one of the best sitcoms in my eyes.",2013

8,"An intense, depressing movie. It sticks pretty close to the facts but focuses chiefly on the relationship between Charlize Theron as Lee and Christina Ricci as Selby. The police are hardly there at all. In fact, neither is anyone else except for Bruce Dern who makes one or two short but welcome appearances.",2004
10,"For once the Oscar went to the most deserving. I was not sure I wanted to see this movie, but after seeing a trailer I became curious and decided to check it out. Charlize Theron completely blew me away! She is barely recognizable and seems to be channeling Wuornos at some points. Patty Jenkins is to be highly complimented on her writing and directing skills also. Rarely have I been so moved by a film but this one simply cuts to the core and leaves you raw. Wuornos was obviously not well, yet Jenkins provides insightful monologues that allowed me to understand and sympathize for Wuornos. It is a sad and moving movie. Never have I felt so disturbed yet riveted by a movie such as this one.",2004
10,"I just saw again Monster, followed by Nick Broomfield's gripping documentary on Aileen Wuornos, and what a brilliant film it is. It sort of reminded me of the kind of movies they used to make in the '70s, where the characters were really the center and they weren't trapped by formulas or by the self-indulgency of the director or the actors. The characters aren't judged, but they're shown with their humanity. With empathy. The result is not your usual indie movie that tries to be hip, or a sugar-coated version of this tragic story with an answer for everything and a nice confortable message in the end, but a truly moving and absorbing film that focuses on the people whose story is telling. At the core there's the amazing performance from Charlize Theron, who's deserving of all the praises and the awards she got. Her work is powerful, subtle, moving and layered. It's incredible to watch Broomfield's documentary, after seeing the film. Sometimes it really seems like watching the same person. It's not only that she recreated her mannerism, which she did perfectly, she's also, somehow, got her energy, as a person. She got to the emotional reasons as to why Aileen's mannerism was like that. In short: an extraordinary performance and a powerful film.",2004
10,"I watched this on video and was completely blown away. I thought Charlize Theron's performance as Aileen was extraordinary, not simply in the scenes with the men (especially the ""last john"", when she has to shut herself off from the humanity of the man she is about to kill) and in generally suggesting an increasingly out of control personality, but in the scenes with Shelby (Christina Ricci), right up to her near-breakdown when she is putting Shelby on the bus. Despite adverse comments from other reviewers, I consider Christina Ricci's portrayal of Shelby equally remarkable, conveying childlike naivety, seductiveness, stubbornness and growing manipulativeness very well. They dominate the film between them, but the supporting performances are fine also. I gave this 10 out of 10.",2004
8,"After just seeing this film, I'm pretty much speechless. This is a tough film to comment on. This is mainly due to the fact that it's a serial killer film where you actually end up feeling sympathy for the killer. Near the end of the film, when it goes completely out of control for Aileen Wuornos, there's no feeling of ""justice is done once again""... quite the contrary, actually. It's so moving and disturbing, following this person's life, through the last part of it. In the beginning, we get a fairy tale-like presentation of Aileen's hopes and dreams in her young years. Without warning, we're thrust into the hard reality of her current years, immediately afterward. From there on out, we're in her world, feeling her pain, experiencing her failures. We get to know her as the film goes on, but we feel for her from the very beginning, without even knowing why she is like she is. That says something about the masterful direction and writing of Patty Jenkins that is featured in this film. The plot is great, and it's surprisingly easy to follow the thought process of Aileen... we understand why she kills. The pacing is very good, there are only few scenes that seem to move slow, and I don't think there was really any point where I was bored. The locations is incredibly authentic. Jenkins actually went out of her way to get shooting done at several places where the real Aileen had been, and even cast people who had met her in smaller roles. Cinematography is great. Acting is pretty much flawless; both Theron and Ricci shine in their roles. The movie also has a unpleasant view of prejudice from the 'other side'(the people who become victims to prejudice), and hopefully this will act as a much needed wakeup call for the people who believe in and go by prejudice. What really makes this film have an impact is how dark and real it is. No happy ending, no silver lining... just tough, uncut reality. When you see it, you can't help getting engulfed in this person's world. The raw horror of her life moves you. I can't see anyone, no matter ignorance, beliefs or moral and ethic standpoint coming out after seeing this film and believing that Eileen was the 'bad guy' in this story. It's just not possible. I haven't seen any of the interviews with the real Aileen Wuornos and I didn't follow her case, but I would like to know more about her, find out what she was like to a greater extent than a movie of 1 hour and 45 minutes can tell me. That's what this movie did to me. It made me care for this person, and that says more than anything I can put in this review. You need to see this film, unless you refuse to watch anything that has harsh reality instead of a happy ending. I recommend this to anyone who can take it. This movie will depress most people, but after this one viewing, I consider it required viewing for just about anyone. 8/10",2005
10,"This movie really helped me to begin my own healing. I, to a small degree, relate to the lead. I am a rape survivor (as a toddler and a college student), it stirred up so many feelings that I've experienced. My innocence is gone... why not try to make some money while re-claiming my sexuality? And of course, I've had a problem with viewing all men as perverts. But she did come across men that were actually wanting to help her -- I wish that could have turned her around the way one man helped me come around. And I'm so lucky to have him. I'm so glad that I chose to see this movie. I hope others can be as positively impacted by this film as I was.",2005
10,"This film is absolutley amazing, it picks on nearly every single human emotion and brings them all to the surface.  As an audience you're left confused about how you should feel towards this serial killer.   Charlize Theron certainly deserved her best actress Oscar, her performance in this movie was moving, thought-provoking, and truly believable, something I find lacking in many currently released movies.  Behind each emotion expressed on Therons face you see a whole lifetime of pain and anguish in Lee's character, you find yourself knowing her past without it being explained to you.  When watching it's easy to find yourself thinking that you're actually seeing Aileen Wuornos.  Being familiar with the story of Wuornos I feel that Patty Jenkins touched on a hugely sensitive subject, and delivered a story with immense passion.  Whether or not you are familiar with the actual events of Wuornos' destructive 1 year period is irrelevant, as Jenkins and Theron bring a character to life that we all can relate to in someway. The notoriety of the actual story brings the problem of making a charicature of Lee, a problem that Theron has easily side-stepped, showing what an amazing actress she is.  I think that this may be my all time favourite film, or it is certainly heading that way.  This film has everything that a REAL film should have, it doesn't need big stunts, CGIs, $20million-a-movie actors...It's just a brave idea, fuelled by a passion that comes through to the audience.  A truly excellent piece of film-making, and even better acting talents.",2004
10,"I found this movie riveting. Charlize Theron turns in a brilliant performance as Aileen - she was unrecognizable. The relationship between the characters is realistically portrayed and the movie gives us some insight into the serial killers motives and mindset. Selby comes off as a weak if loving parter, totally in the dark as to her lovers vicious killings. The innocence of the lovers and ""Lee's"" intense need to be loved form a centerpiece around which the killings seem almost incidental. Theron plays Wuornos as a freaked out victim, raped since a young age and abused all her life. You see her as someone who never really had a chance. The performance is excellent and the intensity of this movie just riveting. I'd see it again and probably will. Highly recommend.",2004
10,"As a Floridian, I watched Aileen Wuornos' trials and news reports as they were unfolding. She was imprisoned and put to death less than five miles from my house. I didn't see the film until after Charlize Theron won the Oscar, and so much had been made of her gaining weight and becoming unattractive for the role I was downright cynical about why she won the award. That is, until I saw the movie!",2004
8,"What drives a person to commit murder? And then do it again and again with no apparent end to the madness? One may never know, and certainly MONSTER does not offer easy answers because no matter how you look into it, Aileen Wuornos was herself a kaleidoscope of changing, flighty emotions, ranging from occasional sadness, an unrepentant attitude, sheer rage, disbelief at what was happening to her, and basic incomprehension.",2005
10,"This is one of the most incredible movies I have ever seen! Christina Ricci and Charlize Theron were absolutely on top of their craft. Not to mention an extremely adept ensemble of supporting cast members that helped make this movie so spellbinding and gripping. Based on actual events surrounding a prostitute turned serial killer in Florida, this movie depicts the facts and it's sequence of events both accurately and vividly while delivering a well conceived and presented story line. The supporting cast is simply amazing. You will recognize many faces, all of whom deliver ""A List"" performances that are sometimes mesmerizing. You will feel the gamut of emotions and you will not be disappointed. Especially if you enjoy non fiction presented by some of the best acting performances you will see in your lifetime.",2006
8,"I had my reservations before watching this. I was sceptical cause of the buzz. Everyone was talking about the way Theron, ""the most gorgeous woman alive"", transformed herself into Aileen. A prostitute who killed several clients. I thought Theron was just looking for success, another ambitious actress wanting a gold statue. That director Jenkins had a reason to make the film didn't matter for me then.",2005
10,"For all of the debates surrounding the prosthetic look of Charlize Theron and her physical transformation into Aileen Wournos, it is her performance and the manner of which she has carried off that performance as that character, that makes Monster such a interesting film to watch. With the direction taken by Patty Jenkins, it is not so much a film about a woman committing heinous acts, but unlike so many serial killer movies which very much rely on violence and in depicting that violence on screen to explain their evil intentions, Monster attempts to show to us that the violent nature of Wournos' erratic behaviour is partly as a result of society's failure to acknowledge and assist those who have fell through the net and were let down by the system; thus they turn to crime, such as murder. I am not saying that I condoned the actions of Aileen Wournos- apart from one who- according to her, tried to rape her-, but rather with the abuse that she had experienced as a child,they played a considerable part in her growing up as an angry, bitter woman. Her psychological and emotional damage was inflicted by those who were in her care and of whom were in the hands of those people of whom were supposed to protect Aileen.",2007

7,"MONSTER Watching this film proves that, despite the boredom and predictability of the Best Actress race in '04, Charlize Theron is one of the most deserving Oscar winners in recent years.

9,"At the same time I find this movie very sad, and even scary when you think it's based in a real story, I also find it a great masterpiece and also very moving. Aileen Wuornos is a prostitute from Daytona Beach who become one of the most famous serial killers of United States, and the first female serial killer as well. Her story is so tragic, that we stay moved even she being a killer: Abandoned by her mother,her father died in prison(psychopathic child molester ), she was molested as a kid (8 years old) as well, she started to be a prostitute at 13,became pregnant at 14 (needing to give her kid away for adoption) and things ended with Aileen's love, Selby,even being cold and insensitive with her in Court, acting like she never liked Aileen. With so many problems, I could not be surprise for this woman be so desperate for love, and entering in a life of drugs and crime.",2005
10,"I loved the first american pie, but was so dissapointed with the second. it was too direct, lacked creativity, and got old. (sorry to anyone who loved it). but ii was delightfully surprised with American Wedding. The sexual jokes flowed much better, it was all situational as opposed to 'hahaha look at my wang', and in general just got more laughs. It is a great movie to see in the theater while your in the mood for something like that, and a lot of fun. although half the original cast is now gone, the remaining few are a good mix for the last of the american pie trilogy. stifler is kinda crazy and unbearable in the beginning but bear with it, it eventually works with the story and gets better. This is such a cute movie.. and yes i use the word cute. Its hilarious, but not so over the top that it looses the sweetness of it, being the fact that the main point of this movie is the wedding of jim and michelle. What a great, mindless piece of entertainment!",2003
6,"This is the third installment in the life of Jim Levenstein and his friends. ""American Wedding"" seems to point out there will be follow up movies perhaps. Why not? This formula has produced three films and could ""American Children"", ""American Divorce"", ""American Single Dad"", etc. will be too far behind? Jesse Dylan directs this one.",2005
8,American Wedding is exactly the type of ending that suits the American Pie trilogy. It's not like the typical TV sitcom where it's feel good and lacking on humor. The traditional gross out honest humor is still present. Unfortunately not all the characters are due to scheduling conflicts.,2004
9,"This was an awesome closure to the American pie series (with the original cast) Stifler is pretty good in this, he always steps it up. The cast kinda gets smaller and smaller as the series goes on, but we are left with the core of the group. Jim again has some great comedic moments, Jason Biggs by now has perfected the role of Jim. This as the second movie, plays it's part as a sequel, series or a trilogy. If you have seen the first two, this will be a good ending to the story for those who haven't seen the first two, or only part one, go out and get caught up before seeing this one. You missed a lot of the action. icing on the cake",2007
10,American wedding is simply hilarious. It is as funny as the previous two. You just keep laughing and laughing. Seann William scott steals the show and so does Jason Biggs and Eugene levy. No pie but still a lot of fun. If you want to have some big laughs then this is it. My rating- 10/10,2003
6,"American Wedding is the weakest of the series but its still very funny and very enjoyable to watch. Jim and Michelle are getting married and Jim wants nothing wrong to happen. Stifler is going to the wedding against the wishes of Jim and Michelle. He is more interested in Cadence who is Michelle's sister and one of her bridesmaids. The wedding is close and there are a lot of things left to do. However, some of the wedding plans go wrong and it looks like this wedding is going to be a disaster, Can Jim pull it together and make it through the wedding? The plot is interesting as one of the guys get married. With this type of film though, the plot is a non issue. People who see this type of movie just want to have a good laugh and they won't be disappointed. The bets thing about this sequel is defiantly Stifler. Sean William Scott gives a really funny performance and pretty much carries this film. He goes over the top sometimes but for the most part he is pretty good. Jason Biggs gives a god performance as Jim. He is pretty much the same as the first two films so if you liked him before then you will like him again. Alyson Hannigan plays Michelle and I find her character really annoying and not funny. Eddie Kaye Thomas does an okay job as Finch, he just isn't as funny as he is in the previous films. Thomas Ian Nicholas plays Kevin and he is sort of just there. He doesn't do anything memorable his character is kind of countless at times. Eugene Levy is back as Jim's dad and he gives a funny performance. Compared to the first two though, its not as strong. January Jones plays Cadence and does a really bad job. If she wasn't pretty then she probably wouldn't be in Hollywood. Fred Willard and Deborah Rush play Michelle's parents. They both are very funny and nice additions to the cast. Missing from the film this time around are Shannon Elizabeth, Chris Klein, Tara Reid, Natasha Lyonne and Mena Suvari. They are not missed and their characters wouldn't really feel right in this film either. James B. Rogers directs and does a good job. The jokes in the film may be funny but they are not as good as the first two. Its surprising how good this film turned out to be as the second sequel is usually stale and bad. Running time is 106 minutes with the directors cut and it's the version you should see. The movie is also a bit more serious at times then the other two. This isn't a bad thing but its just a little different mood then expected. In the end, this is a very funny sequel that's worth checking out. Rating 7.2/10",2005
10,"I gave this movie a 10 out of 10 because for a comedy it made me laugh continuously.  Not a minute was wasted.  Even if the situation was totally absurd, as many were, the conviction of the actors in their roles was enough to keep it going.  Stiffler and Finch's rivalry reached new highs and lows in this one as they compete for the affections of Michelles virgin little sister Cadence.  Fred Willards addition in this third movie was welcome, even if his role was subtle.",2003
10,"This was a hilarious movie. It stays true to the first two, it was just so funny. Jim was getting into all kinds of trouble, just like in the first two. He couldn't keep it in his pants in the first one with Nadia, he glued a porno tape to himself in the second, and in this one, he shaves himself and people choke on his hairs. Gross out humour is once again hilarious, and I was pleased with this movie. 3 out of 4.",2003
1,People just aren't getting this because they haven't looked below the surface. Here's my theory:,2004
6,"While it has it's share of terrific scenes and Seann William Scott is a comic genius - American Pie - The Wedding (which it's known as here in Australia) isn't quite as good as the first two. The reason seems to be that things seem much more contrived this time out, and not as spontaneous as the original was. The highlight is obviously the bachelor party scene which has some great moments for Finch, Stifler and Jim, but there aren't as many laughs as in the first two, which is a shame. Add to this a dull opening act (things don't get going until Stifler enters the scene) and lots of filler where not much really goes on, American Pie - The Wedding is a good but not great, possible end to a nonetheless fine comedy series. But here's hoping that Stifler and the rest of the team have one more of these in them, because they're such appealing movies even when they're not laugh-out-loud funny.",2003
1,"Was this really the worst movie I've ever seen? Well, darned close to it. I really don't know where to begin in criticizing this mess.",2004
10,"American Wedding is the funniest film in the American Pie series. Most of the original gang is back to see Jim and Michelle tie the knot. But, the two characters have to overcome a couple of obstacles. One obstacle is making sure Stifler behaves himself. Does he... not really. Stifler throws a bachelor party when Michelle's parents are supposed to turn up, eats dog crap while saying it's chocolate, losing the ring, and having sex with Jim's grandmother. Stifler is by far the most funniest character in the film, especially when he plays nice boy. Jim and his father are funny, too. I liked the part when Jim shaves his privates and throws the shavings out the window and into people's mouths and wedding cake. The characters are original and hilarious. The acting was great, so was the directing. As with the first two films, there is a great soundtrack. I recommend seeing this grand finale. I rate this film a 10/10.",2008
7,"It was lacking some ingrediants, or cast members, but only an AMERICAN PIE movie could make good of that issue.Its had a great soundtrack, like the others It is hard to say which AMERICAN PIE installment is the best cause there all just one outrageous saga. This is a great (supposed) finish to the AMERICAN PIE series. Id say AMERICAN WEDDING had more laughs that both its predeccesors, even though i never thought that would be possible. It also was a little sweeter. Id consider it more of a Wedding cake. if you liked the first one and second, or at least one of those two, u like this one equally or better. AMERICAN WEDDING delivers  a super slice of guilty, raunchy pleasure. You laugh and laugh, and still laugh even the 20th time u watch it...",2003

1,"Hopefully, this awful movie will put an end to this mediocre series that has gotten worse with each sequel. Almost watchable until Stifler shows up. So tell me, you're in a restaurant getting serviced under the table when your Dad walks in and you jump up with your pants around your ankles and your girlfriend still under the table. Not only doesn't the restaurant throw you out on your a**, but the patrons give you a standing O when you propose to her, with your pants still undone? How charming! Funny? Not in the least! But I hang in there for a while until stifler shows up,ranting neverending curses like he was Joe Pesce in Casino. Whatever was appealing in the first two incarnations of this series is certainly missing here.",2004
1,"Michelle and Jim get married in this rather outdated and profane slice of pie. A wedding maybe sounds a slightly ridiculous proposition, if you consider Jim's inability to control his sexual desires and the general lack of commitment of all the characters in the films to their partners. However, instead of being imaginative and diverting the genre into the intelectual category, they could only end the trilogy with a rather weary line of childish jokes and smutty dialogue.",2003

I don't understand how any audience member could accept it.....WHY DID A**HOLE STIFLER GET THE GIRL IN THE END???   That doesn't make any sense!  Poor Finchy gets treated to an ending almost exactly like the one in Pie 2!!  Stifler's mom shows up out of nowhere and gives him a happy(?)cop-out ending??? Am I the only one that wanted Finch to get the girl?,2004
10,"I went to see American Wedding yesterday and I loved it.  It was hilarious. It was just as good as the other 2.  It was funny, but what could you expect from the people who created the movies.  Of course there would be no movie without the nudity.  I took my dad and we was laughing harder than I had ever seen.  It was a piece of work, but it will be a classic just like the other two.  If you haven't seen the others watch them right away and then o see this, you'll love it.  I recommend it to anyone.  Go see it, it like Porky's in a way.",2003
10,"...If you have seen the first two American Pies, you should also see this one. American Wedding doesn't have all of the original cast, but still caps off the climax of the series. This movie in my mind would have been the best of the series if Stifler (Seann William Scott), was still in the role of Stifler. Actually, it probably is the best of the series. Stifler just didn't talk the same, he just wasn't as smooth as usual, except for that one part, ha ha, you have to see it. But really that was the only downside, Stifler was out of character, but he was still hilarious! Overall, the movie was still filled with hilarious antics, smooth one liners, and of course Jim's dad (Hilarious). Go see it, it really is funny!",2003
10,"Looking thru out takes on this movie yeah, I would have added the scene were there at the head table of the wedding and were Michelle said yeah Steve you can be like Jim brother n law. that would have made a great opening for the next movie. I've seen band camp and the naked mile also wonderful movies, going to far with movies on stiffer but you might bring back where Michelle and Jim just had their baby,(naked mile) and want Steve and Michelle sister as the god parents also Steve just asked Michell's sister to merry him and kinda have a reunion of all the cast from the first American pie at Steve wedding. But idea- at the bachelor party instead of the parents catching them. They go to a night club, well strip club and LOL one of the strippers that come's out is Nada, Like I said reunion. well I have great ideas but you probably don't want to hear me just jabber my mouth so maybe you can take these into an effect and put it into the movie. Thanks a lot and I have every movie and I'm looking forward to so many more. You have made a American pie to be come were you can take something off a movie or your past movies and keep going with so many more American pie. Love it.",2007
10,May be a SPOILER for some:,2003
10,"When I reflect on a movie I've just seen, I try not to pull it apart and examine each piece under a microscope. For me, a movie is more than just good or bad scenes stuck together. I try to base my reviews on how the movie made me feel overall.  Upon that basis, American Wedding was nothing short of fantastic. This movie is a solid end to a great comedic trilogy. Not only can you expect a theater roaring with laughs throughout the film, but the same memorable characters you've come to love are back and better than ever. Everyone's chemistry seems to work perfectly and (**Spoiler, I guess**) at the end, when Michelle and Jim are doing the first dance, I practically felt like it was my kid who just got married ('sniff', 'sniff').

It's sad that maybe some of you out there prefer movies- and life- that way. Thankfully this movie is all about thinking and feeling. This is not a chick flick. It's a human experience flick.,2005
10,"It's very interesting to see all of the ratings that Lost In Translation received in different countries. In Canada it is only PG, while in America it's rated R! And really, the only explanation for this is a brief scene at a strip joint that shows some nudity. I really look down on that R rating because Lost In Translation is a good-hearted film that should be enjoyed by all ages. Notice how during the 2003 Oscar season two films played the ""only one special effect: the effect on the audience"" card; one being this film and the other being Mystic River. Both are great films, both are rated R in the U.S., but only one of them can carry along its story without brutal murders.",2005
10,"Death in Vegas' spellbinding song ""Girls"" perfectly sets the tone for Sofia Coppola's second feature film, the bittersweet, intelligent, mature and absolutely wonderful Lost in Translation. Trying to summarize the movie is almost pointless because the emotions the film sparks within you (in my case, at least) can't be described in words. The basic story follows Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), a washed-up, depressed actor and an emotionally confused newlywed respectively, as they accidentally meet on Park Hyatt Hotel in Tokyo. The two form an unusual bond, but a bond that is infinitely stronger than that which they share with their respective wife and husband (Charlotte's partner is a jittery photographer who doesn't pay very much attention to her; Bob's better half keeps calling him, pestering him about which colour they should choose for the carpet back home). Bob and Charlotte's relationship is not really a sexual thing so much as a matter of emotional understanding. They're both stuck in life, unsure of what to do with the rest of it and certainly not very satisfied with what they've done with it so far. It's very touching to watch, in a refreshingly non-sappy way.",2007
10,"It is not easy to talk about ""Lost in Translation"". Sofia Coppola's second film as a director is in part about things we never talk about. While its two protagonists try to find mutual solace in each other, their silence is as expressive as their words. This is a film that believes that an individual can have a valuable relationship with someone else without becoming part of that person's life. At 19 years of age, I am not married but I can understand pretty well that it is easier for a stranger with whom you share a moment in the bar or corridor to understand your problems better than your husband or wife. Here is an extract from Roger Ebert's great review of the film: ""We all need to talk about metaphysics, but those who know us well want details and specifics; strangers allow us to operate more vaguely on a cosmic scale. When the talk occurs between two people who could plausibly have sex together, it gathers a special charge: you can only say ""I feel like I've known you for years"" to someone you have not known for years.""

8,"I went through an array of emotions and expressions watching this film; most of them centred around how bizarre I thought it was, yet it was like a good book I simply couldn't put down even if the film itself lived up to its title at times.",2005
6,"It's hard, at first, to fathom why this film is so successful - perhaps it's because people think they've seen a 'meaningful' film - it lacks violence, sex (apart from a brief, off-screen reference and another brief scene in a strip club), swearing, and a clearly delineated plot, unfolding in a leisurely, low-key, melancholy, soporific fashion. So sure, it's not M:I3, but that doesn't automatically make it high art, or even a particularly good film, either. Too often Coppola seems content to let the camera sweep smoothly over night-life shots of Tokyo, or linger over Johanssen and Murray's serious faces, with perhaps some music sweeping over to make one think one's watching something 'meaningful.' (In fact, surprisingly for a woman director, Coppola seems to exploit the (admittedly beautiful) Johanssen somewhat - a long amount of time is spent in which the camera gazes on her, often partially clothed (though not nude or bare-breasted), and I was particularly troubled by the opening shot of her behind, which seems to have very little to do with the rest of the film apart from offering titillation for the audience.) The dialogue, which could have saved the movie, often fails to live up to expectations - the central scene, mentioned by another reviewer, where Murray and Johanssen are lying next to each other on the bed, and he gives her his thoughts on life, is quite touching, but he doesn't end up saying anything of much significance, just some bland generalisations about life/experience, and we never really get too many character insights. It's too elusive, too much concerned with surface, despite the fact that so many of its fans praise it for going deeper than most blockbusters. At times I felt I was watching an extended commercial, of the kind that seem prevalent nowadays - seductive visual images with meditative music transposed over the top, calming in a new age meditation kind of a way, but ultimately not saying much.",2007
1,"I was appalled that Sofia Coppola won an Oscar for her drab screenplay. First of all, the characters were unsympathetic and out of touch with the world.

1,"This film just further proves that I simply do not understand film critics. Lost in Translation is horrible.  What exactly is this thing supposed to be about?  Nothing happens.  The characters do not develop, change, or even engage in anything relatively interesting.  I don't need a movie to enjoy a ""snippet of life"", all I have to do is look around me.  If there's supposed to be a message in this movie, it's either way beyond my comprehension, or it's simply ""people that are unhappy and alone sometimes find others to share their misery with"".  I'd like to find someone to share my misery after watching this debacle of a film.  Sure, the scenery is sometimes pretty, but that's Japan's fault, not Coppola's.  It manages to be effective in spite of her, not because of her.  1 star out of 5.",2004

I spent money to rent it so I kept watching it for another 45 minutes...still no plot after an hour. I would say what the movie is about, but I don't know that it's really about anything. It's a conglomeration of pointless scenes that don't make up a story. I was expecting a great film considering it's 8.0 ranking here at imdb, but for the life of me, I can't figure out how one person would think this movie is in any way good, let alone fifteen thousand. This one has apparently done well at the film festivals, so that should be enough of a sign to steer clear of it. Indie movies are indie for a reason...they suck. This is a great one to rent if you struggle with insomnia.",2004

I believe if people watched the movie they'd like it more for the subtle brilliance that prevails. The roles played by Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson performed flawlessly with enough emotion as necessary. It will now be one of my favourite films though not action - packed it is a masterpiece of emotion and through the use of clever cinematography enthrals the viewer. I would suggest this is more of a chick flick though I'm sure most men will understand the true emotion of the film.",2005

4,"Why would someone direct a movie like this one is really beyond me. Bill Murray acts predictably - same funny jokes as in other movies, not bad. That's the only good part. Movie starts off with a camera focused on see-through panties of the main heroine, and yes you can see her buttocks clearly well. Then camera fades away and dives into a movie. Why the scene? No reason. Never explained. She continues to wear those panties throughout the movie, why? I guess she is hip or something. There are quite a few disjointed, unexplained scenes like that. No, I don't need everything spelled out for me, but such scenes which mean nothing at all and should've been cut are just stupid. As some other reviewers said, this movie makes fun of Japanese like crazy, even to the point of plain stupidity. For someone who said that this movie is 'down to earth', this statement is wrong. This movie is the pop culture of the day, from beginning to end. This is reflected in explicit content, such as nudity (which is a part of Japanese culture, indeed), but is not necessary for the movie's story. Bill Murray is supposed to be married and is in his mid-life crisis, and while on his trip to Japan, sleeps with another woman, then in the end, flirts with the main heroine and then returns back to America to his beloved wife. Is this not the pop culture of the day? Sex with no consequences, behind back of your partner. This movie is about pop culture and promotes it, is not down to earth, but just down. The movie is boring. It has no story of any kind, doesn't end the story in any way, they both return back home, after having cheated on their spouses and having made fun of Japanese culture and Bill is still in his mid-life crisis, and the girl is still unable to sleep, or whatever her problem is. No point in watching this movie. It is relatively short, has some charm, but ultimately no story. It's downsides (racistic humour, pop culture all over the place, disjointed scenes which add nothing to the movie) outweigh it's positives (lots of scenes depicting Japanese culture, Bill Murray's humour).",2009
1,What an awful movie. Another example of a piece of trash film that gets a high rating by being passed off as artistic. There is nothing artistic about a bunch of still shots staring at a gloomy Bill Murray as he attempts to act depressed.,2010
1,"The only thing that was lost in this movie was the story line. Mostly staring out windows, at ceiling, at walls- we got the point the first ten times- they were lost and lonely and felt out of place- It wasn't necessary to beat us over the head by showing the same basic scene over and over and over and over again.  If the",2004
10,"After my third viewing, I can finally admit that this film has me. I enjoyed it during its theatrical run, enjoyed it more the second time around, and now, I can only say that I love it. The cast is exemplary. Tom Cruise is so good in this film that it is very often easy to forget he is Tom Cruise. Easily his most powerful role and best performance since Jerry Maguire. Ken Watanabe, however, is incredible in every scene - acting with a rare sensitivity and intensity and breathing life into a character much larger and more human than the grand story of which he is a part. Though the entire cast is excellent, I feel that I must also single out Koyuki and Shichinosuke Nakamura for, respectively, the female lead and the emperor, for the subtle strength and believability they each give their very challenging roles.",2005
9,"The Last Samurai is a brilliantly crafted aesthetic pleasure, studded with supernal performances from Ken Watanabe and Tom Cruise. In fact, Tom Cruise unarguably gives his best ever performance, surpassing his portrayal of Jerry Maguire in the eponymous flick. His plaintive portrayal of Nathan Algren, not only evokes pathos but also seeks sympathy of the contemporary viewer, who can vicariously relate to Algren's disconcertion, owing to his inner conflicts of patriotism vis-à-vis humanity.",2009
10,"I was skeptical about this movie because not every high-budget feature with Tom Cruise is guaranteed depth or serious acclaim, although it may gather at the box office.  And Warner Bros put me through TORTURE to see this pic - changes of times AND locations, over and over.  I felt like was on an survival test, an unbearably annoying treasure hunt over weeks and was frankly ready to give it a negative review (which I'm writing on behalf of a publication).  However, I found the movie truly and unequivocally remarkable and cannot contain my review in 350 words.",2003

9,"This film is the best Tom Cruise film ever, alongside Ken Watanabe's superb acting. Though slow paced at first it demonstrates the importance of honour, not judging people on first impressions... This film follows a rather sad story of fighting for tradition and avoiding judging anyone until you meet them. It is full of truly breath-taking scenery in Japan and superb battle scenes. The lead actors are truly amazing which goes very well with a great story. This film really proves that Tom Cruise can act! This film deserves more credit however, it is truly Oscar worthy, for Watanabe's acting and battle scenes mainly.",2005
8,"The Last Samurai is a strictly by-the-numbers samurai epic set in 1876-1877 Japan. All the necessary ingredients are here - beautiful Japanese landscapes and costumes, larger than life battlefield sequences, and eastern philosophy.Although the pageantry is not as beautiful as such samurai epics as ""Heaven and Earth"", it is more than adequate.",2004
10,"I disagree with a lot of the reviews of this film. Yes, it is true that it does glorify a lifestyle in an exaggerated and unfairly sublime way, but I think we're missing the point. This film is romanticism vs. modernism. It's purity vs. corruption. It's not so much the premise or believability, but the substance behind it.",2005
8,"""The Last Samurai"" 2003 and ""The Last of the Dogmen"" (1995 d: Tab Murphy, with Tom Berenger and Barbara Hershey in the lead) are both films with the theme of the 'last' of warrior spirits (one is Samurai, one is Cheyenne). The production of The Last Samurai is well worth seeing - the glory of a large-scale Hollywood production it is. From the research of the historical Japanese Meiji period, the mannerisms, the way different classes of people dress, the settings, the battle weapons and armory, how the Samurai train and fight, to the study and appreciation of the Art of War - where men of honor and integrity in service to the Emperor is the thing to die for. The film title in three Kanji characters means The Way of the Warrior (Samurai). The one character shown on screen at the very beginning (romanization: Sze) meant in the service of the King. Hence the definition of Watanabe's Samurai lifelong one true goal - to serve his Emperor, one and only, and to die in the service of the Emperor would be an honor.",2005
9,This movie is one of the best films I have seen. It is very different from any other samurai movies or any film that has to do with the Americans or Japanese in the eighteen hundred. This film combined American history and Japanese history that practically no public school teaches as far as i know.,2009
9,"Although not a box-office hit and factually inaccurate, I love this movie and would definitely put it in my top 10 favorites of all time. My wife just bought me a PS3 and I had to pick up a blu-ray disk to see the difference for myself. With SO MANY terrible, terrible movies available on blu-ray (Flyboys, Stealth, and Reign of Fire - the movie i consider to be one of the worst of all time - just to name a few), I decided to pick this up even though I already owned it on DVD. I had seen the movie in HD on DirecTV before, so there were no surprises regarding quality, but I was still really impressed when switching between this and the 480p picture produced by my DVD player. The colors are much more vibrant, the clarity is remarkable and it serves to submerse you in a movie that was already great as it was. As a huge fan of the movie as well as of HD picture quality, I was happy to pick this up at Best Buy for $25, but I probably wouldn't recommend getting this if you have it on DVD already unless you're a big fan. Now, if they could just get the Lord of the Rings Trilogy on Blu-Ray...",2009

Now seeing it again now more mature and more knowledgeable of history this film has allot of meaning to me. It's epic, sprawling, beautiful, intelligent, brutal, honorable and most of all heart breaking.",2009
9,"I watched The Last Samurai last night for the 1st time, and when the credits came up my eyes began to fill. Now I don't feel like this easily, but there was something about this film that made me feel so good, so different to so many other films. It was like making a New Year promise, as I started thinking about so many different things afterwards, like how much people whine nowadays at the simplest tasks etc. How badly I want to be in love...lol. How beautiful Japan is (I'm going to the Far-East for my first time in July - China). How beautifully Taka (Koyuki) was portrayed, and was not degraded once, by OTT sex scenes or nudity. Her relationship with Nathan (Tom Cruise) was so beautiful, and I felt the pain of both their lives/situations. Just shows how ridiculous wars are...you could kill a man on the battle field....and he may very well have been a good friend. However, the battle scenes were extremely well choreographed and moving and the film contained the perfect amount of action, romance and culture. As a westerner who hasn't ever been to the far-east, yet alone lived in the 19th Century I cannot comment on it's accuracy, but nonetheless I enjoyed every breath during this superb film.",2004

1,"I am a Japanese. In this movie I see many false misunderstandings and errors on Japanese culture. For example, they try to overlap Samurais and Native Americans, which is very difficult for Japanese to comprehend. In one scene, Samurais were fighting in a jungle. We do not have a jungle in Japan. They try to depict that swords are the most important thing for samurais, which is not true at all. Bushido is not that shallow.",2005

Even if you are not a Tom Cruise fan,you should still like this movie.Cruise plays Algren as a man who is at first,deeply flawed,with no hope.Then,as the movie progresses,Cruise convincingly portray's Algren's slow,but noticeable change into a humble man who regains his humanity and discovers what it means to be a man.This Movie is directed by Edward Zwick(Glory,Legends of the Fall.The screenplay was written by John Logan(Any Given Sunday,Gladiator).the action scenes are well done and look authentic.the dialogue is well written,leading to some very touching scenes.the movie is also visually stunning. everyone involved put their heart and soul into this project and it shows. 10/10",2007

1,"I like Japanese movies and I like movies about samurais and for some reason after I saw the ads I bought a ticket and went to the cinema to watch it. I expected something like the ""Shogun"" with it holliwoodish but still interesting entertaining exploration of Japanese culture. But what I saw was so cheesy that walking out of the theatre I felt like I start hating Tom Cruise for lurking me into the 2 hour popcorn- for-the-brains show. I always expected Tom Cruise to finally die, but he never did. Instead he went on chopping the samurais (who, supposedly dedicated all their life to the sword fighting art) right and left. The scenes where he trains with the master of sword remind me all those hundreds of cheesy Rambo-Kickboxer movies where the white Americans kick the asses of their Asian adversaries in the field of the martial arts after having trained those arts for some 10 minutes. The movie is quite expensive and has a pretense of being a historical drama, but the plot and the message of it are just way too cheesy. Hollywood clichés are oozing from every scene. The worst part is the ending where Tom Cruise (an Amercian officer who came to teach Japanese the modern Western war technique and subsequently underwent a transformation embracing the ""old ways"" of noble fighting with the katana sword) together with his noble friends dash in their last suicidal charge with the naked swords right onto the machine guns of emperor's army and... what I see: all Japanese are dead and Tom Cruise is still hanging on, all wounded of course, but alive and with this tremendously heroic face he tries to stand up, alone among the corpses of all his friends. Here the director apparently wants us to cry and sympathize with our hero, but all I felt was a creepy feeling that one might feel when observing something so utterly false and cheap cheesy that you want to shudder. So my verdict is: It is bad, very bad. Even for Tom Cruise.",2005
10,"Full disclosure: I'm a HUGE fan of Ed Zwick as a director and filmmaker. Full disclosure: I'm an even bigger fan of what he and his team created in ""The Last Samurai."" Tom Cruise, never better. Ken Watanabe, masterful. Direction, script, music, costume, art direction, cast ... without peer. Far from being the ""racist"" film some PC types have labeled it, this is a work of art, a beautiful, poignant story about warriors, honor, duty (to country and self) and friendship, and perhaps in more esoteric terms, peace, harmony and the secrets and mysteries of life itself. It's all there if you let the story tell itself to you. As a cinematic experience alone, you'll be richly rewarded. I won't belabor other good reviews by taking more time repeating many of the points they've already well made. See it once and let it take you where it will. You'll learn something about yourself and the world you live in, the lessons are that timeless. It will be a film that sticks with you, that you'll treasure again and again.",2009
9,"Although the central character is American mercenary Tom Cruise, the story of The Last Samurai is about the little known to occidentals event of the Samurai revolt of 1877 led by Saigo Takamori who operates under a different character name and is played flawlessly by Ken Watanabe. Changing his name much like the way Clarence Darrow and William Jennings Bryan were under different names in Inherit the Wind allowed for some dramatic and historic license.",2006
4,"The Last Samurai is a movie about the fascination of Americans for Japanese culture, more specifically Japanese heroism.

7,"I've been reading the comments page in a somewhat bemused fashion.  It seems to be divided between people who don't like the movie because it's not enough like the original graphic novel and people who don't like it because they've never heard of half of the characters that are members of the League.  The latter seems to me to be an unutterably silly reason for disliking a film.  Does nobody read the classics anymore?  Nobody reads Oscar Wilde, Bram Stoker, Robert Louis Stevenson, Jules Verne, H.G. Wells, or Sir Arthur Conan Doyle?  I find that difficult to believe.  As to the former--not enough like the graphic novel, in other words--just how in the heck can a screenwriter accommodate the dark and twisted visions of Alan Moore in a two-hour Hollywood movie, anyway?",2004
6,"Having been critically panned by both film critics and fans of the original comic book version, you'd be forgiven for thinking that the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (which is hardly a league of ""Gentlemen"" considering the presence of a female character) was absolute rubbish. However, despite the flagrant misuse of characters established in classic Literature (Dracula, The Picture of Dorian Gray, The Invisible Man, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea and especially The Adventures of Tom Sawyer) there is an essentially a massively fun film to be found, made all the more enjoyable if you disengage your brain and just don't question the ridiculous goings on of the alternate Victorian universe the film is set in.",2006

The bad reviews are understandable, but keep in mind that it's coming from people who don't enjoy really good stories (OH they'll insist to the death that they do). I've even seen a split amongst the community of el geekos, but I find it seems to be an even split between the rationals and idealists (the idealists being the LXG/Alan Moore appreciators).",2003
8,"Many times film have such bad vibes during production that they are rumored to be a terrible mess before they have a chance to premiere.  Some films that suffered this fate during filming were The Godfather and Titanic.  Both turned out to be box office bonanzas and the trouble they had making it to the big screen was quickly forgotten. Then there are films like Valley of the Dolls and Myra Breckinridge which were legendary for their on the set squabbles and dissension among cast members.  The end product of both of those productions were films that should have won awards for being the ultimate in cinema stinkers.  In 2003, we are given The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, which had already become legendary for it's problems between director Stephen Norrington and lead actor Sean Connery. Add to that such disasters as a flood wiping out production in Prague and you have a nation full of critics ready to pounce.  And film critics being what they are in not wanting to waste an opportunity, pounce they did making it one of the worst reviewed films in the past year.  Add to that the fact that Fox made the mistake of pitting it against Pirates of the Caribbean in it's opening weekend and it you have the makings of a box office disaster. Did League deserve it?  No, it's a film that in my opinion is fun, highly watchable, and deserved none of the over the top blasting it took from some critics.  Maybe if it had come out after Gigli many would have looked more kindly on it.",2004

While there were major differences between the characters and the books they were taken from, for the most part it was like seeing old friends, i knew what the various characters would do becuase they kept the proper personalities.  I even figured out who the villian was because I noticed one of the major works of victorian literature that was missing from the movie. And you do not need to have read all of these books to understand the movie, but there is a bit of a lack of character developement that you may find, but my friends who hadn't done the reading also enjoyed the movie.",2003

I have read reviews both on IMDB and elsewhere that didn't speak too highly of this movie.  I disagree.  I was extremely entertained.  Granted, I do have the handicap of being a huge fan of Sean Connery, but one must realize there is a reason he is still making films. HE IS COOL.  It begins with a mission of worldly importance for a motley group of would-be heroes/villains assembled to save the world.  There are some incredible fight scenes, and great effects.  This movie has some great performances, fantastic twists, and edge of your seat intrigue.  I will definitely be purchasing this DVD for my collection, and would eagerly view a sequel.",2003

This is a fun movie that doesnt have to have every single plot point explained ad nauseam. Bravo to the filmmakers for not spending 3/4 of the film explaining back history on these characters (NOTE If you are having trouble with this concept...read a book!) This film was ten times the movie that the overhyped Matrix Reloaded and the god awful Hulk was....oh and by the way; Mister Hyde was a much better Hulk than the Hulk was as well.

While i would not recommend it as a must see movie, I certainly didn't find it to be a waste of my time. Sure, some plot points could have been developed more/better, but hey, I didn't walk in expecting Shakespeare.  Though I haven't read the graphic novel on which the film is based, I have read that both the graphic novel and the movie take place in a reality alternate from both out history and our literary canons; which means that even though Stoker never wrote Mina as turning into a vampire, it's okay for LXG to take the license to do so. And so on and so forth.",2003

I know a lot of people don't think of Sean C. as anyone but 007, but he has a way of taking that character & adding it to all his new ones. Well, he once again succeeded. And the others involved? Well, lets just say I was impressed. The surprise on the betrayal, the change in attitudes of some characters, and the unity in the end  very impressive. Obviously the timing is off somewhat, but who cares? I think the mix & match of it all made the film even better. I have talked to some who think the opposite & even have said that the mix and match makes it too confusing. My question is  how? This movie is about heroes and winning against the ultimate bad guy and love and betrayal. What else could you want in an adventure movie?

I was surprised when I read the reviews on IMDB . . . after the fact. This is the first review I've written for this site, but usually when I watch a movie I go here and usually what I think is right around what is given to the movie, I give this movie about a 7.5-8. Not as good as Pirates, but still a fun movie, but I never read the books, or comics, but I think people seem to be taking that too seriously. They remind me of 'Comic Book Guy' from the Simpsons. I kind understand the whole book-movie ratio. It never adds up. That's why I don't read.(kidding) Anyway, I have read Spider-Man comics since I was young and can see being critical of anything that might tear that stuff up, but I really enjoyed this film, so don't be scared off by the guys taking it too seriously, it's a good fun film.

I was reluctant to watch any of the episodes and refused bluntly to my friends when they suggested seeing just an episode.",2005
10,"A rant: I do not see why all of these previous comments here are so hateful. If you read them carefully and inspect where they were written, these people have watched a maximum of probably 5 episodes. To me, that is like judging a movie by watching twenty minutes of it and leaving the theater and giving the movie a bad name. Honestly, it is a show for the family and really isn't meant to be a hard-hitting cartoon because most parents with 10 year old aren't really looking for them to be watching a show that is too dramatic for their age. Also, while I enjoy Justice League like a lot of people, I think the plot gets a bit too complex for the adolescent mind and the kids just end up watching the show for the action scenes rather than to know what the story is. This is a show meant for various audiences therefore they have to make the story condensed in each episode in order to keep a child's attention span, yet the writers manage to put enough in their to provide you with a substantial amount to keep an adult or teen interested.",2008

10,"Aw man! When I first saw this series I felt so happy and thrilled that Anime and America joined forces to accomplish one of the biggest hits ever! This series has a lot of action and hilarious crude humor and some new ones. My favorite character is Robin because Teen Titans expresses a lot of crisis that Robin faces as a leader and having to deal with his dark-side gives an edge to new superheroes. The Robin and Starfire relationship is a great essential plot to most of this series. Raven is a new superhero that brings the meaning of sacrifice to television. I love her too even though she is not my favorite because Robin is a great leader who cares much about his friends than himself. Anyway back to Raven. Without her, Teen Titans wouldn't be Teen Titans. Her scary and dark past makes you go crazy, you want to know more about her each time an episode shows. I love her power. Even though she could still take over the world she is still vulnerable because unlike the Justice League series where people tend to die, Teen Titans does not show about that kinda quality. I still think she is powerful and next is Cyborg. Cyborg is a new class of teen heroes equipped with the latest technology and is really funny. He and BB really make the show running and I mean it Literally. I feel so sorry for Cyborg most of the times because he never got the chance to feel how it is to be a man until he finally figured that out in Episode#39: Titans East part two. But still I guess he would love to be human. Beast Boy is really hilarious and tries to fit in and make everyone understand him but every time he does he screws it up by accident. But hey his powers fit perfectly with his whacked out and cool style. Last but not least cute little alien Starfire. Now she is a new breed of superheroes today. I love her personalities the most. Her main problem is trying to cope up with earthly situations which Justice League does not show at all with that dumb and ugly Martian the Manhunter. That show is so serious and you sometimes get bored to death because they are old adults which normally is focused on by movie makers. I mean come on Teen Titans is the first DC comic television show that really focuses on teenagers which I truly appreciate. This show is really great and focuses on true life events and crisis that happens and now have turned it into a bunch of teenage superheroes with problems in different styles. Teen Titans is a really 'supercalifragilsiticexpealidocius' show.(I really wanted to express my feelings towards this show and this word is perfect for America's #1 hit show) I hope that the rumors are true because I really miss this show.",2006

9,"Man, I really do miss Batman TAS, X-Men, Spider-Man and Batman Beyond when they were on the air. Those shows rocked compared to the garbage we get nowadays. Skunk Fu? WTF!!! Why not just make a animated musical for crying' out loud. It's got a lot of things going for it. The anime-inspired artwork, great plots and character interactions are all high marks on my book and on par with past cartoons and makes you care about the characters. I also like the new Ninja Turtle cartoons per se but Teen Titans was taken from us too soon. They need to put this show back on the air because its the only cartoon that's worth watching on TV that actually has a lot going for it. ",2008
10,"Well,this show is actually very good. I thought that it would suck when I saw the trailers, but it's great!!!The best thing about it probably is that the whole thing isn't all about the characters backgrounds,and more of a visual treat.It isn't really too true to the original comics,but the show is aimed more at little kids,so.The characters portray a very wild,brother/sister slapstick relationship,which gets maximum laughs from both my five year old brother and myself.There is also some awkward crushes that are made to be a bit too awkward,such as the beast boy/raven relationship.This is an excellent show,and my favorite superhero series so far.well,other than static shock!",2007
9,"It was only logical that a show and comic strip would be made about the younger DC comic heroes of established canons(i.e. Batman,Superman,Green Lantern,etc)and so ""Teen Titans"" has burst forth onto the Cartoon Network with a reasonable amount of success.",2007
9,"What can I say about this show? Since the first episode, I was hooked. Being an anime fan, I found this series to be not only full of great action, but full of brilliant humour as well! The voice actors are among the best of the best. Tara Strong as Raven is brilliant, Greg Cipes as Beast Boy was wonderful, and not forgetting Scott Menville as Robin, he really brought out the teen hero that made him a popular character (although Raven is my favourite Titan!!).",2006
8,"I'm sure that not many people outside of Australia have ever heard of the legend of Ned Kelly. I once saw a documentary about the man, but that's the only time I once saw or heard anything about him. And I guess that this might be the biggest problem this movie will have to face. No-one knows anything about it and probably not many people will care about the subject.",2005
9,"Due to reading bad reviews and being told by friends that they couldn't believe how bad it was, I didn't go and see this film at the cinema. After watching it on DVD, I have to say I regret that now. I'm not saying it is brilliant, but I would venture to say that it is a good movie. I enjoyed it.",2004
10,"There are few films that leave me with the feeling that Gregor Jordan's 'Ned Kelly' film did. Initially I had heard only half hearted recommendations, and decided to see it for myself. Since then, I have acquired both the video and soundtrack, and have to say that after several viewings, I am still very impressed with the underlying character of this film. It is also wonderful to see something Australian! I appreciate its down to earth quality, that if you ask me is a rarity, as well as the absence of tackiness that takes away from so many films. This film proves that you don't necessarily require fancy costumes and a glamorous set that absorbs how many millions of dollars to make a point. The cast was a bonus, including a variety of well known, and might I add, good looking people who did well to slip into the role of such unique characters. It is interesting to note, that much of the criticism regarding this film has been about who played what, and how they only said so many lines. However, if any criticism is due, it should constructively focus on the fact that a number of basic elements of the original events were excluded. In reality, these functioned to made it the hallmark that it is in Australian history. For example, on a closer examination it can be discovered that there was much, much more to the relationship between Joe Byrne and Aaron Sheritt, and that this was in fact responsible for many more of the final outcomes for the gang than were explored in the film. Also overlooked was the fact that it was not only Aaron Sheritt's efforts alone, that provided the Victorian police with their insights into the unfolding mystery. Yes, this is their interpretation of the story, and it is understandable that true stories require sensationalism and at times the modification of the original plot to grab the viewers attention. I feel that in this case, this is the only limitation. However, I can accept that perhaps historical accuracy is only of significance to those who have a particular interest in the realistic events behind a situation. It certainly inspired me to look more closely. So, watch it and decide for yourself. You might not like it at all, thats your opinion, and thats fine. Maybe it is a film that appeals largely to an Australian audience? For me, I'd call it a breath of fresh air!",2004
9,"The performances were superb, the costumes delivered a unique feeling for the period and being a Victorian Living Historian, I was impressed with the accuracy of weaponry and attention to detail.",2006
7,"The story of Ned Kelly has been enshrouded in myth and exaggeration for time out of hand, and this film is no exception. What ensures Ned Kelly has a permanent place in history is the effort he went to in order to even the odds against the policemen hunting him. During several battles, he marched out wearing plates of beaten iron, off which the bullets available to police at the time would harmlessly bounce. Indeed, it is only because there were a few bright sparks among the Victorian police who noticed he hadn't plated up his legs that he was captured and hanged. The story has been told in schools and histories of Australia for so long that some permutations of the story have, ironically, become boring. The more the stories try to portray Kelly as some inhuman or superhuman monster, the less people pay attention.",2005
8,"I'm tired of people judging films on their ""historical accuracy"". IT'S A MOVIE PEOPLE!! The writers and directors are supposed to put their own spin into the story! There are a number of movies out there that aren't entirely accurate with the history....Braveheart, Wyatt Earp, Gangs of New York, Geronimo: An American Legend, The Last of the Mohicans....all fantastic films that are mildly inaccurate historically. If you want to see a few great actors do what they do best, then I suggest you see this film and don't worry about the accuracy of the facts. Just enjoy the quality of the film, the storyline and one of the greatest actors of our time.",2009
6,"Before viewing Ned Kelly, my only knowledge of this Australian outlaw was that he wore a bucket on his head. Having now seen this fairly enjoyable movie about his struggle for justice in the outback, I am a little bit more clued up; but I do have to ask how much fiction has replaced fact in this telling of the legend of Ned Kelly. Was he really so righteous, or have facts been changed to make the character more sympathetic and appealing to the audience?",2006
10,'Had Ned Kelly been born later he probably would have won a Victoria Cross at Gallipolli'. such was Ned's Bravery.,2005
10,"Fantastic movie. One to excite all 5 senses. Is not a true historical report and not all information is to be taken as factual information. True Hollywood conventions used, like playing A list and VERY attractive actors as the 'heroes', such as Naomi Watts (Julia Cook - Ned Kelly's lover), Heath Ledger (Ned) and Orlando Bloom (Joe Byrne - Ned's right hand man), and unattractive (sorry Geoffrey Rush) actors play the drunken and corrupt Victorian Police Force. This also instills a very unreliable love story into the mix between Ned (Ledger) and Julia Cook (Watts) to entice all the romantics, females being especially susceptible. Even from the first scene, when Ned saves the fat youth from drowning and his dad calls him ""sunshine"" and had a ""glint in his eye as he looked down at me, his hand on me shoulder,"" it is very romanticized and persuades viewers to side with Ned Kelly, the underdog. Besides, don't all Aussies love an underdog?",2009
6,"I walked into this movie expecting to see a legendary Australian folktale, turned into a piece of Hollywood fluff and to an extent that is what I got. However, even with the exaggerated soundtrack and the ficticious Naomi Watts character who had too large a part in the story this movie is not with out it's charms, the image of the Kelly gang in their iron suits facing an army of Victorian police at the Glenrowan Inn is an incredably striking one.",2003
7,"Those who know who know the Kelly ""legend"" & are hoping that this film would be an accurate depiction of his life may be disappointed with the creative license taken with this film (eg. Naomi Watt's character never existed in reality), but if you look at it purely as a piece of entertainment, it holds up pretty well.  Ledgers performance in the title role is quite solid, taking the mantle of cinema's best Ned (not hard considering the previous Ned's include Yahoo Serious, Mick Jagger & former Carlton champion (Australian Rules Football) Bob Chitty, a great footballer but a poor actor. Some location shooting film in the area I live, Bacchus Marsh outside Melbourne as well as Clunes & Ballarat.",2003

5,"I've seen the Sydney Nolan paintings. I've read the book (well, ""The True History of the Kelly Gang"" rather than the novel that this movie adapts). Now I've seen the movie.",2003
1,"Why does everyone who takes on the English establishment have to be hard done by, be decent, lovable and good natured at heart and freedom loving but oppressed and thus driven to fight back against tyranny and injustice. The fact is that the Kelly gang were the local thieves and rogues who were forever in trouble with the police. They were of Irish descent but so were the police at all levels of rank and so was the Judge who had Ned Kelly hung. When four police tried to arrest the gang three policemen were shot dead, one as he lay wounded at Ned Kelly's feet, and one escaped. The Kelly gang was now a bunch of murderers who eventually got what they deserved. After having said that it must be accepted that Ned was brave in that, dressed in his suit of armor, he came back to fight the police face to face in the final shoot-out. But he was no folk hero, just a pitiless criminal. He was a hard man and if only the film makers showed him as he was with emphasis on him being such a tough character and as such a menace to the community even though he was personally courageous. Being as brave as he was should not make us naturally assumes that he must be an admirable personality.",2011
10,"I love movies based on true stories, especially history. I thought the cast was excellent, Heath Ledger, may God bless his soul, and Orlando Bloom. The Irish accents were strong and believable. I strongly recommend this movie and would love to watch it again. I picked it off of Netflix after looking for ""Rob Roy"" and this movie was recommended. I'm so glad I watched it, only confirming that Heath Ledger was truly an excellent actor. Naomi Watts was wonderful also. It's one of those movies that one could watch several times and still catch things missed in previous viewings. I would like to see more movies Heath performed in, as he was with us too short a time. Great movie, plot, acting, sound effects, music, etc.",2013
7,I watched this on the movies with my girlfriend at the time and I can say that I didn't have the best time mainly because I didn't know about Ned Kelly or his story.,2008
10,"Ned Kelly is a fantastic film that i suggest you see. I own it on DVD and have watched it several times. I found it to be a well produced, well thought out film. One of it greatest aspects is that the producers have put in quite a decent amount of effort to make it true to history, most of the things in the film did happen in real life. Also it features fantastic cimeatography with many aspects of the Australian landscape show cased. THe music is also good, it is used mostly to set the mood and is not over the top as in some films. A lot of the music in the film is soft piano background music which compliments the film instead of taking over as music can do in some films. Overall a fantasitc movie and highly recommended.",2006
10,"Ned Kelly is the story of the famous Australian outlaw but it shows him in such a light that you feel so sorry for him. The amazing acting that Heath Ledger gave to this film really opened him up to his outstanding reviews for this and other movies. The raw power of this movie really makes you think about how hard the Irish immigrants in Australia had it in the 1800's. Gregor Jordan spares no expense in building this film to all of its potential. Orlando Bloom does an amazing job as sidekick Joe Byrne. His suave ways of acting around women really showed Orlando's slicker side in films. Laurence Kinlan and Phil Barantini's portrayals of Dan Kelly and Steve Hart were very powerful, especially at the end when they both have to decide what to do when they are trapped in the burning bar (trying not to give anything away here!) Naomi Watts was astonishingly talented at playing Julia Cook, Ned Kelly's secret lover, of course the fact that he was actually sleeping with her off set might have helped a little bit. Over all this movie is tremendous, and I HIGHLY recommend renting/buying this film.",2006

8,"A traditional, well-made western - suitable for most ages, features good guys herdin' cattle, bad guys tryin' to steal the cattle, codes of honour, a corrupt sheriff, a fantastic shoot-out, and Annette Bening being lovely in the wings. Open Range doesn't do anything particularly new, it just does it particularly well. For actor/director/producer Kevin Costner, it seems to have been a labour of love and one that has paid off handsomely. The characters are well fleshed out, it has plenty to appeal to adults (men and women) rather than being just a boys-with-guns film. The qualities of the main heroes are likeable - they value the trust, respect and confidence that is given them and realise the value of these things. Open Range is no high and mighty moraliser however; there are plenty true-to-genre one-liners, such as ""You're nothing!"" (grim-faced, cornered bad guy) - ""Maybe so,"" (good guy pointing a gun at him), ""but I'll still be breathing in another minute!"" Towards the end of the film they also battle with their own inner demons. What starts out with all the flavour of a Boys' Own adventure (complete with cutesy dog) turns out to be a well-rounded minor classic. Long live the Western!",2004
8,"In ""Open Range,"" we are drawn to two men running from their pasts, an aging lonely cowboy, Boss Spearman (Duvall), and his long time second hand man Charley Waite (Kevin Costner). They drive their herd of cattle from a vast prairie to another with their two young helpers: the giant Mose (Abraham Benrubi), a gentle fellow who mostly works as wagon driver and cook and Button (Diego Luna), a teenaged orphan eager to prove himself to his elders ",2006

9,"(This is my first written review, so bear with me)",2004
9,"When this film reaches the climactic shootout, it is a real cinematic treat. Costner has a great feel for creating and choreographing complex action scenes. There is one wide shot in particular that contains many actors involved in a number of separate interactions carried out in a masterfully-planned sequence. It is worth watching several times and paying close attention to each individual shootout going on within the larger scene. Costner has mastered the art of filling the screen with complex action.",2005
9,"The cowboys Boss Spearman (Robert Duvall), Charley Waite (Kevin Costner), Mose (Abraham Benrubi) and Button (Diego Luna) are conducting their cattle herd through the fields of the West. Boss and Spearman have been friends for ten years, and they have an special affection and friendship for Button, Mose and his dog Dig. Boss requests Mose to return to a small town nearby and buy some supplies for the rest of their journey. Mose never comes back, and Boss and Charley decides to check what happened with him. They find Moses beaten and arrested in the jail by the corrupt Sheriff Poole (James Russo), accused of fighting against the men of a powerful local rancher, Denton Baxter (Michael Gambon). Boss and Charley bring Mose to the local doctor, Barlow (Dean McDermott), where Charley falls in love for his sister, Sue Barlow (Annette Bening). They return to their camping, they are attacked by Baxter's men and Mose and Dig are killed and Button is seriously wounded. The two old cowboys return to the town looking for justice. ""Open Range"" is one of the best contemporary western, with the characters very well constructed and an engaging low paced story having action, drama and romance. The performance of the cast, highlighting Robert Duvall and Kevin Costner, and the direction of Kevin Costner are magnificent. I believe in the future ""Open Range"" will be considered a classic in the genre. My vote is nine.",2005
7,"Why studios don't make more westerns is beyond me. Some of them are downright unwatchable like ""Young Guns"" and its sequel but there have been some extremely well made films like ""Unforgiven"" and ""Tombstone"" so I'm at a loss as to why more are not made. Thank you Kevin Costner! This story is about four men who are herding their cattle through a certain area and they stop near a town to get supplies. The crew is headed by Boss Spearman (Robert Duvall) and his second in charge is Charley Waite (Costner). They send Mose (Abraham Benrubi) to get supplies and after a day or so he doesn't return. Boss and Charley go to find him leaving Button (Diego Luna) to watch the herd. In town they find Mose beaten badly and locked up in the local jail. A rich rancher named Denton Baxter (Michael Gambon) hates ""Freegrazers"" and tells them to take their man and keep moving. Baxter controls the sheriff (James Russo) and also has many thugs on his payroll. Back at the herd some of Baxters men have been following them so Boss has an idea of going after them instead of running. That night they confront them and smash their rifles but when they get back Mose has been killed and Button is wounded badly. They take him to the local doctor and meet his sister Sue (Annette Bening) and Charley takes a shine. Boss and Charley don't like to be told where to graze their cattle and they want revenge for the death of Mose. A final gunfight in town is inevitable and Charley reveals that he killed many men in the war. This film was directed by Costner and its very well made. He seems to have found his mark as a directer with this genre. Costner allows the story to unfold on its own terms and the pacing is deliberate which is welcomed after watching so many Hollywood films and their quick edits. The film should be seen on the big screen to be appreciated. The scenery is beautiful and their are so many shots with skylines and mountains and wide open prairies and these shots help tell the story in the film. The scenery is important and gives the film a look that helps you relate to the characters when they speak of not wanting to be told where they can go. The characters are well written and they let out things about themselves little by little as the story is told. Duvall's character is a man of high pride and also a stubborn side and he's not afraid to stand up for himself even if it means he might die. Costner plays a man with a hard past and he seems to be living his life and coming to grips with his experiences in the war at the same time. Charley states that he doesn't have a problem with killing and we believe him. The romance between Costner and Bening seems forced and Bening looks a little to old to be a woman that never married. The film goes on about 15 minutes to long and Costner has not one, but two goodbye scenes with Bening. This is a minor complaint because this is a very entertaining film and after a summer of watching hyper-kinetic Hollywood junk, It's a movie that is very welcomed. Hear that Hollywood?",2003
9,"Powerful, heartwarming, well written, well acted, and with excellent sound, Open Range is my favourite western. With the exception of good triumphing over evil, the film is virtually free of Hollywood clichés. Kevin Costner may not be the greatest director, but this genre is his cup of tea. He knows what he is doing, and he does it splendidly.",2009
8,"Open Range is without doubt one of the best family movies I have seen for a long time. Although not quite as good as ""Dances With Wolves"" Open Range, funnily enough, not only stars Kevin Costner but is along the same theme in as much as it tells a story about the early American way of life. This time about the ""Free Range"" cattlemen and the different hardships they had to cope with. And for once my family could sit down and watch a movie without all the smut, swearing and extreme violence that unfortunately, all movie makers of late, seem to think is necessary to sell them. The storyline was simple and easy to follow at the same time as it retold a fine piece of early American history. ",2005
8,"Robert Duvall is what makes this movie as good as it is. The man is a national treasure, and, sadly, I suspect, he won't really be fully recognized as such until after he's dead and gone. But in the meanwhile he just seems to just get better and better with age.",2005
9,"It's purely my own opinion of course, but Open Range is a modern day genre classic that stands up to repeat viewings. It's not a flawless Western the Western historians will tell you, and some will pick out the hats or the impact of a rifle to mark the film down, but really we should be embracing a genre piece in the modern age that is clearly being directed with love and respect by the director.",2008
7,"It's probably well known that Kevin Costner once had Republican party sympathies , something that wasn't to fashionable in the Hollywood of the late 80s/early 90s . What might not be so well known is that he switched his allegiance to the environmentalists / greens at the turn of the millennium . This perhaps isn't so surprising because if you watch a film either directed by or starring Costner there always seems to be a running theme of the characters existing in a wilderness away from civilisation such as DANCES WITH WOLVES , PRINCE OF THIEVES and WATERWORLD alongside the philosophy that guns don't kill people , people kill people , or to be more accurate bad people kill people then good people kill bad people as seen in THE UNTOUCHABLES and THE POSTMAN with PRINCE OF THIEVES and WATERWORLD also coming into this category also ",2005
8,"Good westerns are hard to find these days, or any westerns at all for that matter. There are a number of made for TV movies and series, as well as the infamous ""Deadwood,"" but as a whole this is a genre from a different time.

Conagher might have made it except for the dust billowing up from a cattle drive trail during a ""rainstorm."" All failed in the horse apple test. Hundreds of horses on dirt streets, no horse apples ever. Horse dung ground into dust by hooves created a choking dust in New York City before the automobile, but never west of the Mississippi. According to Hollywood. ",2013
9,"Once again, Robert Duval deserves Oscar consideration for this one.  The dialogue was crisp so kudos to the writing team.  The attention to detail must also be applauded.  During the first walk through of the town, the realism was mind blowing.  The detail of the main characters trying to cross the street as the water rushed by was incredible well done.  Who couldn't relate to that?",2003
10,"This is one of those few(for me)films that I can watch several times each year. I still feel it is Kevin Costners best work,either in front of,or behind the camera. I feel that it is Annette Benings best supporting role in her career,and only her turn in ""American Beauty"" was as good,leading,supporting,or otherwise. Robert Duvall is fantastic,completely nominatable-but is'nt he always?. He is,to me,a treasure. Seemingly always considered strictly a supporting player,he is a better actor than a slew of ""best actor"" winners that come to mind. Oops,that sounded biased. The writing is beautiful,adopting a ""less is more""character that is absolutely necessary for people from this time and circumstance. Honesty,loyalty,bravery,guts and most important of all,love,are all woven into this beautiful movie. I have been a movie fan my entire life,was given this gift by my father,who owned a business in L.A.,not far from Culver city. I have watched a lot of films. I was thinking about how many films I really DO watch multiple times per year. The number is roughly 10. This is one of them. It is a beautiful piece of work(did I mention the cinematography?beautiful!)in every way and it does the one thing that any film that I am going to call ""good"" must do...it moves me.I love it. B.E.

It took all of those masterpieces from the past and rolled them all into one hit movie. I just love this movie and the novel it's based off of. Kevin Costner definitely needs to keep going on as a director, because he definitely has the talents for it. And I'd like to see Robert Duvall get on the saddle again one more time.",2006
8,"This is a cinematic triumph for Kevin Costner and Robert Duvall. It is indeed slow moving, however, this pace allows the viewer to relish the scenery for which Costner as well as Redford are well known.  The sound track is vivid and realistic.  The mood is one that holds one's interest, and the overall effect has an impact that lasts long after one leaves the theatre.  Bravo for Duvall and Costner.",2003

Then after a couple years, I found myself renting the DVD version to have some rest at my apartment in Canada. Staying lonely at my place, I thought to get some team spirit from this western. From my second view of the movie, I thanked God that I was not living in country; for Open Range has implicated metropolitan suburban solitude to a such good story.",2008
3,"Aside from the gunfight scene, I felt the movie was a waste of celluloid. Robert Duvall, Kevin Costner, and Annette Bening could have played those roles in their sleep. The dialog was marginally tolerable (and there was plenty of it--no one sat together quietly in this movie), the plot was all over the map as if they could not decide how many themes to cram into the story, there was no subtlety at all--foreshadowing hit you between the eyes and they led you by the nose through most of the story (I think they added all the dialog to make sure you didn't miss anything), and the editing really needed tightening up (each actor's screen time was more quantity than quality--again, too much dialog).",2005
7,"Last night as I started to watch this I almost stopped during the opening scenes. The pace is slow, real slow. I tend not to tolerate slow moving stories very well. Yet as soon as I met Boss Spearman and Charley Waite I was hooked. Robert Duvall and Kevin Costner did a fantastic job of convincing me they were driving those cows through the open range. In fact by the time the two hours and nineteen minutes rolled by, I didn't feel it. I'm not saying that slower paced westerns are all I will watch now, but this one was worthy the viewing. May even find itself reviewed a few years down the road.",2013

3,"If you can endure a 90 minute portrait of brooding self loathing with virtually no dialog and uninspired cinematography, this film is for you. The notorious scene with Daisy is incongruous. Perhaps, I am dense, but in my view, the emperor has no clothes. To be successful, this film should have elicited a strong interest in the lead character. But in the end, you have learned little about someone who is shallow and unappealing. This film portrays the journey of a motorcyclist tormented by demons vaguely hinted at in mysterious stops he makes in route. You see that he is attracted and repulsed by women. (Cheryl Tiegs, for those of you old enough to remember her from the 1970s is perfect in what amounts to a cameo.) But his encounters with women are so fleeting and glancing that you learn little until the end of the journey. Then, what you learn is too trite to support your having endured the trip with him. I believe Vincent Gallo had a serious idea, but the idea is unrealized.",2006

Gallo definitely needed to step away and let a professional editor do his/her thing and mercilessly cut scenes that didn't move the story forward.",2006

So, I was really looking forward to see Gallo's next project... and let me tell you: WHAT A DISAPPOINTING!! He's suffered sort of an involution: once he was totally honest and now he's totally narcissistic and pedantic. In his second film he shows us Vincent Gallo riding his motorbike, Vincent Gallo getting' a couple of Cokes from a drinks machine, Vincent Gallo crying because the world is too beautiful, Vinczzzzzzzzzzzzz.....",2006
10,"I saw Buffalo 66 long before I started posting reviews at imdb, so I haven't written about that film but I loved it, I give it a 10, and after seeing The Brown Bunny at the Nuart on Saturday evening, I am here to report that I give Gallo's second feature film the same rating. ",2004
5,"After racing in New Hampshire, the lonely motorcycle racer Bud Clay (Vincent Gallo) drives his van in a five-day journey to California for the next race. Along his trip, he meets fan, lonely women, prostitutes, but he leaves them since he is actually looking for the woman he loves, Daisy (Chloë Sevigny). He goes to her house and leaves a note telling where he is lodged. Out of the blue, Daisy appears in his hotel room and soon he learns why he cannot find her.",2014
1,"This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. Driving across country by yourself is boring enough, but watching someone else drive across country alone is even more boring! There was only 10 lines of dialog in the movie. The camera angles were strange and the music was so depressing I wanted to slit my wrists. I think what bothered me more than the endless driving, was how these women seemed to think that he was a ""hot boy"". They would just randomly go with him although he looked and acted like a crazy person. Sane people wouldn't ask a stranger to drive across country w/ them, especially when she's like 16.",2006
1,"Vincent Gallo According to the credits is a man with many ( probably too many ) talents. While I haven't seen any of his other films, this one lacks a, direction. b, editing c, cinematography d, intelligent script. Vincent Gallo as an actor acts well as a depressed person, but that is all. When he brakes down with his former wife or girlfriend he utters a sound which could be credited to a whingeing cat, but hardly to a man which I suppose he represents. The repetitiousness of the scenes,his portraits in the mirrors show that as a director he admires himself as an actor, but I do not consider this as a positive.",2006
10,"I had heard about the controversy surrounding The Brown Bunny (who hadn't?)--the feud with Roger Ebert, the graphic sex scene--so when I received an invitation to a press screening, I jumped at the chance to see what the trailer calls ""the most controversial American film ever made"". What the trailer and all the hype didn't prepare me for was the fact that The Brown Bunny could also be considered one of the most original American films ever made. In a time of overblown budgets and enormous productions with endless crew lists, Vincent Gallo has almost single-handedly made a concise, well-thought out, conceptual film--a poignant, touching love story. It's not often that a director's second film is more daring than his first--money, greed and Hollywood power seem too tempting to most and sophomore efforts usually represent the big sell out. Not so The Brown Bunny, not so Gallo the iconoclast. He manages to make a second film more interesting, more intimate, more revealing and more memorable than his first. And he manages to do it outside the system.",2004
1,"Vincent Gallo has a reputation. He makes movies that are for a lack of a better word, different, and as such, they find their way into the thought-o-sphere, where everyone forgets what makes Gallo's movies different, and the uninitiated walk away with the sense that Gallo makes real art that really is worth seeing, It's not. I promise you.",2011
1,"As a film fan I've tried to watch it on three different occasions... I stopped watching it before the notorious bj scene. I've tried this movie stoned, drunk and sober and it is just horrible. I kept thinking to myself: ""why am I watching some narcissistic guy pretending to be an actor?"" I read on wikipedia that this movie cost $10.000.000. Someone got screwed big time. I'm a designer with film making experience and I can make a better quality film with my DV cam and my laptop. I actually suspect Vincent Gallo of having used just that and putting the rest of the $9.990.000 in his pocket. Besides that the plot is just one big ego trip of Mr. Gallo Acting: kindergarten play level. Framing: awful Technical difficulty level of this movie: high school with dumb students. And the worst part: It's so pretentious it isn't funny anymore, while the level of associations and intelligence would bring tears to any serious film student or any sapient being.",2007
1,"This movie is an insult to anyone passionate about the art of a good film (basically because it's trying to be art house). If I could compare this to other trash house art, it would be the equivalent of Tracey Emin's 'unmade bed' (or the tent she erected in the Tate, plastered the names of ex-lovers inside, then conned the mindless audience that it's art) on show in the Tate gallery for X amount of pounds.",2008
1,"I loved Buffalo 66, so I gave this movie a try. Unfortunately, Vincent Gallo has sunk to self-indulgent lows with this film. It is not interesting, or even introspective. Everything Gallo does in this movie has been done before, and it is entirely cliché. I don't mind that there is little dialog or few characters. I detest big Hollywood movies, car chases, and all that other garbage, and I go out of my way to find interesting indie movies. This movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Gallo's attempt at a portrayal of a ""lost soul"" is ridiculous, and Chloe Sevigny may never get another serious movie role after her portrayal. I don't want to write a ""spoiler"" so that's all I will say. But just seeing the movie is a spoiler enough for me.",2005
3,"If you want to watch a guy drive around for about an hour, this is the perfect film for you. Professional drivers must detest this film even more than the average person I would imagine; And given the rating on IMDb, obviously most people think it's crap.",2010
10,'The Brown Bunny' is the kind of independent art film that was always destined to polarise the opinions of critics and audiences alike. Gallo's controversial decision to incorporate a graphic hard-core oral sex scene between him and co-star Chloe Sevigny was interpreted by many as gratuitous and the film's modest pacing and minimalist plot inevitably alienated a large section of mainstream film-goers.,2005
2,"This is literally the first time I have seen a movie that was almost purely ruined due to the poor dialogue. Browse through some of the quotes to get an idea. The second and arguably equally or more important flaw is, simply put; This movie is literally one of the most boring films of alltime that tries to present itself as a serious piece of cinema. There is absolutely no semblance of a plot until the last 20 minutes of the movie, which beforehand is largely led by a string of seemingly random and nonsensical events, the most perplexing of which is when Budd stops to get a drink at a vending machine, passes a woman sitting on a bench, then sits next to her and the two begin inexplicably making out for minutes until he departs as suddenly as he arrived while the two never exchange a single word of dialogue. Also the scene in the beginning where Budd convinces a corner store worker to get into his van and drive off with him to California, after the two say barely more than a few words to each other, ending with him saying ""Please.... Please come with me."" felt painfully staged unrealistic, and sappy.",2008
1,"Maybe the worst movie I've ever seen. Completely misguided and self-indulgent, it has none of the redeeming qualities of other very bad movies: it's neither campy or unintentionally hilarious. This film is the very definition of tedious, pretentious crap. ",2008
1,"This really was the worst movie I've ever seen. I consider myself a cinematic intellectual, and this poor excuse for an art film was ludicrous. It was 90 minutes of Vincent Gallo self-aggrandizement complete with a 10 minute scene of explicit oral sex that added nothing to the movie whatsoever. I would recommend that everyone sees it, however, just so they can marvel at the fact this was ever released my a studio. I think those that actually accept this as a valid ""art film"" are too wrapped up in long pauses, languid eyes, and landscape and forget a decent movie should have relevancy, real emotion, dialogue, and some semblance of reality. . . . .",2005
1,"The driving scenes that occupy the bulk of this hideous yet insubstantial film rapidly become meaningless and tiresome, the music is quite appropriately horrid sub-Grateful-Dead bad-retro ballads. Think less atmospheric road movie, more like someone driving around wasting film in a van with a grubby windscreen. Any accidental cinematographic highlights trawled up in this way are swamped by a surfeit of interminable similarity.",2006
1,"With the onslaught of independent and art house films making the cut these days that indeed provoke positive thought, there seems to be plenty directors who use art house as a ploy for putting just anything into film. ""Brown Bunny"" ranks high on the list of films that disintegrates the spirit of decency in film making. The film lacked an interesting plot, which is a travesty in itself. Cinematography? Poor. Direction? None. Character development? Mastheads have more life. Reason for the movie? Well, I'd argue with anyone who says that it was not to feed into Vincent Gallo's narcissism.",2008
1,"Perhaps there's an underlying message in this shameful excuse for a ""movie."" Maybe I just don't get it. Brown Bunny seems to be a hit and miss movie, some love it others hate it. Thankfully I only spent $4.50 renting this waste of life. While the concept of the movie seemed to be really interesting, the attempt to bring of one of the most realistic portrayals of a male angst and sexuality to the silver screen, the overall effect of it is not. What do they do in the movie? Drive, and when that gets old they drive some more. As the movie progresses you'll find yourself asking: ""Where is this going besides to California?"" and here's the answer: it's going at a turtle's pace to a ""climatic"" finish that seems to be there mostly to be controversial. My boredom level reached an all time high during the coarse of a mere 89 mins. I found myself reading my video game strategy guide for Star Ocean: Till the End of Time, plotting the next coarse of action. Do what you will with this movie, I plan on staying far away from it.",2006

7,"In ""Under the Tuscan Sun"",  a recently divorced American writer/critic (Lane) ventures to Italy where she sets about putting the pieces of her shattered life back together in the rustic, bucolic, scenic countryside of Tuscany. Lane registers a fine performance in this lighthearted drama spritzed with humor and romance which is as lovely as it is clumsy. Obvious in its attempts to tug at the heart-strings of romantics with all the expected Italian stereotypes and cliches, this flick received mixed reviews and will resonate most with more mature sentimentalists. Those who enjoy this film may want to check out V. Redgrave in ""A Month by the Lake"" (1995). (B)",2004
7,"Poet and writer Frances Mayes became a household name when in 1996 she published ""Under the Tuscan Sun"", a book where she detailed how she and her new lover bought and renovated an abandoned villa in Tuscany, Italy. With her stylish prose, she made the book something more than a mere diary of the renovation and turned into a captivating chronicle of her trips through Italy and her familiarization with the country's rich culture. The book's detailed account of Mayes' trips attracted director Audrey Wells, who used the book's story of the renovation of an Italian villa as a basis for this charming romantic comedy set in Tuscany and starring Diane Lane.",2007
9,"This movie is wonderfully romantic. It is sweetly written and just a good girl movie. Any woman who has had any sadness in her life and needs a new start will appreciate this movie. The views are incredibly and makes you want to fly to Tuscany and live there forever! The characters are those that make you fall in love and you will relive moments in your life while watching this movie. I will say you need to be in a loving or romantic mood before watching this movie. It does take a few minutes to really get good but when it does, it's wonderful. I hope you enjoy as much as I did. A Walk in the Clouds with Keanu Reeves is also like this movie. It has the same romance and drama but is much sweeter.",2005
8,"So, I've heard this film got the beating because it wasn't like the book? Ah, well, trust me; I'm a huge book-lover (and Harry Potter fan), so I can say that if I had read the book and was an immense fan, I probably wouldn't have liked the film if it had taken the basis out of the original story. I truly sympathize with those of you who disliked this film because it did not go with the book in some way or another. ;)",2006
6,It's a story about how people who want things badly rush themselves into experiences that are worse than their previous ones. It's a good movie with several deep messages. The movie also has a certain atmosphere that makes you feel as if you are in Tuscan on a trip yourself. I have to disagree with the view that says you need to be in love to enjoy the movie. All what you need is some depth and you will definitely relate to the protagonist. She happens to be healing from a failing marriage but you can relate to her story if you are dealing with any kind of problems in your life.,2009
1,"Well to do American divorcée with more money than brains buys a rundown villa in Tuscany. (Much more money; whilst having to dicker over the price, she subsequently manages to cook sumptuous buffets for her workmen and wander around Italy indefinitely with no job or apparent means of support.) Interminable boredom and the inevitable Italian lover ensue; this is a chick flick in the most pejorative sense of the term. Lane acts like an unskilled clueless teenage ingénue throughout - which dynamically clashes with her seriously fading looks - along the way smashing into a variety of (mostly Italian) cardboard stereotypes, dykes, divas, senile contessas and gigolos among them. Bloated with unnecessary scenes, the most ridiculous being a clumsily inserted and pointless recreation of the fountain scene in 'La Dolce Vita'. (A similar conceit was used in an effective and appropriate narrative context in 'Only You', Norman Jewison's vastly superior ode to Italy and romance). 'Tuscan Sun' may be the most vacant piece of cinema of the last decade, despite its admittedly well-lensed panoramas of Italy. Bonus negative point for the extraneous lover parachuted in at the last minute to provide requisite Hollywood ending for its targeted audience of Oprah-brainwashed housewives. Avoid at all costs, unless, of course, you view Oprah and Dr. Phil as pinnacles of intelligent discourse.",2008

With the help of her gorgeous star, Ms. Wells found backing for this pastiche she ended up presenting to us, which bears almost no resemblance to the original book by Frances Mayes.",2003

7,"When the American writer and critic Francesca (Diane Lane) divorces from her husband, she becomes very depressed. Meanwhile, her lesbian friend Patti (Sandra Oh) gets pregnant and Patti and her mate decide to give their travel to Tuscan in a gay tour as a gift to Frances, to lift her moral. Once in Italy, Frances decides to spend all her savings, buying an old villa in an impulsive decision. While reforming the place, Frances finds wonderful places, friendship with the locals and love. ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" is a delightful romance, with a tour through the wonders of Italy and a great homage to the Italian cinema, with a reference to ""La Dolce Vita"" and a minor participation of Mario Monicelli. Diane Lane looks like wine, becoming more gorgeous along the years, and with a lovely face and smile. I have never had the chance to visit Italy, and after seeing the magnificent locations and the nice people of Italy, I believe most of the viewers will have the feeling of expecting to have a chance to visit such a marvelous place. I really liked this enjoyable film. My vote is seven.",2005
3,"I've just seen this film, and I've never laughed so much in my life! First of all I'm Italian and most importantly I live in Tuscany..... The things that happen in this film don't happen in real Italian life. Let's start: Italy is a bureaucratic nightmare, so if she(Frances) wanted to buy and live here she must wait months and months before she gets the house. In the village where she lives there are a lot of Italian stereotypes that you'll never find in Italy. In Italy, especially in small towns people speak bad Italian and mostly in dialect (even if you knew a little Italian you probably wouldn't understand)let alone speak English. The polish are quite uncommon in Italy, there are a lot of Moroccans and Albanians. Even if middle Italian beauty is higher than other countries,finding men like Raul Bova(Marcello) in the street is rare. The man that puts flowers in the vase everyday, in real life at the end of the film instead of saying hello,would have put his middle finger up ( in a rude gesture). Hardly anybody has fresco's in their home. The wedding dress the young girl wears looks as if its fifty years old. If you go in a fountain, the police would arrest you.....DON'T DO THAT IF YOU COME HERE!!!! If you ask a policeman for a lift(even if you are Naomi Campbell) he won't. In Florence hospitals you'll never find Armani or Vesace covers.",2007

What a story of triumph over circumstances! The lush Italian scenery, the colorful characters, the Romeo-and-Juliet romance between a lovely Italian girl and a Polish laborer - breathtaking! Loved the Italian grandma - she saved the day for her granddaughter by her testimony.  Sandra Oh did an incredible job, but the true credit for this picture goes to Diane Lane - what a beautiful smile she has.  She was perfect for this role.  My recommendation?  GO SEE THIS FILM!",2003
1,"Ridiculous, nauseating doggerel with terrible acting; ineptly, superficially, and condescendingly trawling all the most banal clichés about Tuscany and Italy, divorce and midlife. The main actor nervously grimaces her way through the film, struggling to portray the appropriate level of smug, self-congratulatory self-pity the worthless character and script call for. I'm sure the book was bad, but it can't have been this bad! The camera is permanently fitted with a vomit-yellow ""Tuscan"" lense filter (perhaps the Tuscan sun wasn't Tuscan enough?), which they forgot to remove when the scene shifts to Rome and (how imaginative!) the Amalfi coast. You've never seen the white marble of Rome's Vittorio Emmanuelle monument looking so yellow... I mean Tuscan. One of the worst movies ever, and therefore quite worth a look.",2006

This is a ""chick flick"" and not even a good one. Even my wife hated it. There is no plot, nor much point to the movie. You keep waiting for something good (or at least interesting) to happen, but it never does. There are a few laugh lines and a good reenactment from La Dolce Vita. That's it. When the credits begin to roll, you realize that there really isn't anything to take away from the movie, and that you have wasted 2 hours of your life that would have been better spent watching nearly anything else, not counting Tele-Tubbies. Let me echo other comments about wondering if/when anyone in the movie ever works to earn a living. If you have to watch this, at least enjoy the scenery.",2006
4,"The movie starts off promisingly, with the Diane Lane character discovering the infidelity of her husband and the ensuing heartbreak of divorce. Almost nothing works after that. The problem is the logic of the thing -- her two gay friends exchange their tickets to Italy for one first class for her. Okay I can maybe buy that. She goes on a gay tour and is sad, sad, sad. She runs into a flamboyant Blanche Dubois type and is instantly fascinated with her -- not my reaction, I found her cliché and unbelievable, but each to her own. Then she sees ""the house"" and her whole life changes. My b.s. detector went up big time when she jumped off the bus, left the tour, and managed to finesse the house away from the couple who had already made an accepted offer. (The bird crap on the head as a sign from God was particularly annoying.) Then there are the men in her life -- a married Italian hottie, a fickle Italian hottie, and the age-appropriate Italian not-so hottie with whom you'd like to see her end up but he's married and faithful, how boring of him. By the time she gets to the last-minute young American guy, you really don't care. ",2004

7,"You know that feeling you get when you're watching America's Funniest  Home Videos and the oblivious son hits his hapless father in the crotch  with an aluminum bat? It gets a quick reaction, like, ooh, I feel your  pain man.  FINAL DESTINATION 2 is a 90 minute or so string of those painful shots,  as each character one by one meets an unfortunate death by household  appliance. Bodies are slammed by trucks, heads are impaled, and limbs  fly through the air. When one of the characters dies when her car's  airbag explodes out of nowhere, I blurted ""Yeah! Wow, did they do  that??? Yeah, they DID do that. Right on!""  Although the film has a very serious atmosphere about it, what with the  creepy score and people sincerely freaking out and everything, it still  retains a campy humor about it buried beneath its high-budget exterior.  Many movies would shy away from smashing up plastic ketchup-filled  dummies, opting instead to avoid the gore. Not FINAL DESTINATION 2!  This movie is an honest approach to movie-making, hearkening back to  the day when you got together with friends and said, ""Okay, in this  scene we cut to the dummy falling off the building, it's run over by a  Mack truck, and it splatters chunks of blood all over that Oldsmobile  over there.""  As for the premise behind FINAL DESTINATION 2, how do I put it into  words? A.J. Cook has premonitions that people died in a nasty pileup on  the highway. Thing is, this never happened. And ... she continues to  have premonitions that those same people will die in due time. Those  people eventually die. Did I get that right? The universal law of  nature is that, well, Death sometimes misses its mark and has to fix  its mistakes (which usually involves electrical equipment getting wet  and other freak accidents of home improvement). If this all sounds  convoluted, watch the movie. You'll see what I mean.  The premise of FINAL DESTINATION 2, as much potential as it might have,  doesn't make much sense and is pretty hokey, but if you medicate your  inquisitive mind with heavy sedatives, you'll be able to look past the  flimsy premise and enjoy the movie. I'm definitely looking forward to a  Final Destination 3.",2005

This wasn't a sequel in the purest sense, but the film makers created methods to link all of the new characters to the old ones, creating a flow which wasn't too jarring. Unfortunately, the dialogue was the only real stinker in this film. The pretentiousness, the obviousness and the downright hokiness that came out of the mouths of the characters really detracted from the tension, turning their performances into a bunch of acting class rejects. But I digress. The only thing people are looking for is how Death will get the new set of escape artists. The sheer surprise and execution of the executions made me jump and crawl. In such a desensitized world we live in, being able to jump out of my seat means this film is a winner.",2003

6,"Final Destination 2 is a very entertaining sequel and while the story is weaker then the first, the deaths are better. Kimberly (A.J. Cook) is a normal teen who is taking a road trip to Daytona with her 3 friends. She has a vision of a horrific traffic accident and so she blocks some of the cars from entering the highway. Sure enough they vision comes true and they have all just escaped death. Kim visits Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), the only survivor of Flight 180 who is convinced to help out the survivors of Route 23. Alex, who died between films, had been hit in the head with a falling brick. Kim, Clear and other strangers that are left must try to stick together and cheat Death again. The plot may sound stupid but its actually not all that bad. The story may not make sense at some scenes and the story is filled with holes. Its hard though to write a good story for something like this and I think they gave a good effort. The first film was very good and a lot of fun to watch. The sequel is even more fun to watch, even if it does get silly at times. Its better to watch the original before watching this so it would be easier to follow the story. Most horror films today are to silly to take serious and that's why you shouldn't really approach this one expecting an Oscar quality film. The acting was decent with the best being Ali Larter. She and Tony Todd are the only stars returning from the original film. A.J. Cook plays Kimberly and she does an okay job. The rest of the cast are mostly unknowns and aren't worth mentioning. David R. Ellis directs and he does really good job. He also directed the fast paced and exciting Cellular. The film is very gory and also very fun. Final Destination 2 was very creative when it came to killing off the characters. A couple of the death scenes do go over the top though the film delivers the goods for the most part. The film is only 90 minutes long so it's a quick film to watch. The movie also never gets boring as its always entertaining. I wouldn't say the film is to scary but there are some moments that may leave with fear. In the end, this is a very good sequel, that's better then the original and worth checking out. I just hope Final Destination 3 is just as good or even better then this film. Rating 7.8/10, check this film out as its very entertaining.",2005

I ranked it really high for what it was - it's not trying to be A Beautiful Mind, it's trying to be a great popcorn movie. Back when I was trying to be an actor this was the kind of movie I fantasized about being in - what could be more of a blast. I don't find movies scary generally so I can't say that I thought it was scary, but it was fun. I could watch that car crash over and over - how cool it would have been editing that. I always detested slasher horror movies - tedious and lame. As a horror movie I thought this was much more enjoyable. My Best, BDK",2005
7,"The director obviously thought that when making a sequel, everything has to be bigger and heavier. But bigger doesn't equal better, and it definitely isn't the case here. The death scenes are unnecessary gory, and only that; practically no build-up to the scenes, and little to no excitement. Unless you enjoy watching extremely bloody, gory death scenes, you won't like this movie. In fact, you will most likely hate it, unless you're a big fan of the genre, or of the first Final Destination. It's a huge gore fest, and probably made for(and maybe even by) fans of the old ""body-count"" movies, from the 1980's. It has very little realism; whereas the first Final Destination had some realism in the death scenes, this had little to none at all. As many other slasher movies, it has the little ""twist-in-the-end"" at the very end, but it is very weak, considering what it could have been. The first movie is a lot better, but if you *need* to watch a gory movie where you pretty much sit around and wait for people to die, this isn't the worst you can watch. But if the choice is between this and the first, I would definitely choose the first. 7/10",2003

7,"This was almost like a flashback to a few weeks ago when the exact same thing happened for real on Interstate 4. It wasn't a log truck, but fog and a controlled burn that caused an 80-car pileup and much burning of trucks and bodies. I could not help but think of that when I saw the incredible accident scene in this film. It could have been used as news footage.",2008
5,"The first ""Final Destination"" movie took an intriguing concept, assembled an attractive cast to realize it, and forged ahead with gusto and its tongue planted firmly in its cheek. The result, aided by an ingenious script, was a highly entertaining film - sometimes funny, sometimes scary, sometimes just good. But it was a concept that could only really stand one examination.",2003
6,"The dialogue seems to make this movie a little cheesy, but it is still surprisingly entertaining. I have not seen the the first ""Destination 1"", so I can't comment on comparison's between the two at this point. I had seen this movie by chance and knew nothing about it. It started off okay, then quickly got into to the main ""substance"" of the movie, which I can fairly accurately describe as ""carnage"". This is definitely a movie for fans of gore. It's not particularly scary, but has a type of ""tale of the crypt"" feel to it. I found it not particularly funny, but still amusing. There was one scene that had me reminiscing about a scene from the movie ""Cube"". It's not for you if you're looking for romantic comedy or something like that. Also not for you if you're expecting elaborate plot twist thriller. Also, there is no ""skin"" in this flick, but they do throw in the customary blonde chick. Anyway, I definitely put this as above average on my list of ""B"" movie ""sleepers"" (meaning under-rated and surprisingly good). So, my rating is based on that.",2005
1,"I enjoyed the first final destination, and went to see this one in the theater. The idea was no longer novel, so they had to go with a lot more gore in order to attempt to keep it fresh. It didn't work, and I honestly was saddened that anyone would consider what I was watching to be entertainment. Fr'instance, a boy being crushed to death by a giant glass plate while his mother watched. Yeah. That's just not funny. And with the scene where all the main characters are supposed to die, where a log-carrying semi truck accidentally dumps its load, I'm now pretty paranoid when I drive near any trucks on the highway. Especially if they are carrying logs. Does that make it legitimately scary? I'd say more disturbing than scary. This was the worst movie experience I've had this side of Freddie Got Fingered.",2006
7,"As good a sequel as the filmmakers could have made, ""Final Destination 2"" still delivered the goods the original did.",2005
1,"Well, I've expected a lot more from final destination sequel, at least some really scary scenes. When I say Scary, I don't think of tons of blood and flesh flying around. Whole horror part is based on flesh & blood, so it looks like sitting in a butcher shop. At least final destination had some quite good story, this time story isn't so bad, but acting, effects, twists are silly.",2005
6,"Again, another surprise hit at the box office so Hollywood tries to squeeze a sequel out of it. Well, given that that isn't a very good idea and that this movie will pretty much be a retread of the first one (which I enjoyed - especially the beginning but ""Death"" became absolutely ridiculous at the end - going through these preposterous ways to try and kill these teenagers)BUT this movie KNOWSthat it is a sequel and that it is silly so yes, the movie and the script are pretty lame BUT what this movie has is some of the most impressive gore and special effects I have seen in a big studio film in a long time. In fact, the opening highway accident is incredibly well shot and set up and the actually violence and trauma of the collisions are breathtaking. Plus once the doddering plot gets going and you are just waiting for the ""survivors"" to bite it, well, the actual deaths are, again, very well done. Now does good gore make a good movie - no. But it certainly makes for a hoot to watch with some of your buddies. Nuff said.",2005

8,"John Holmes is so famous, he's infamous (as the Three Amigos would say). This is a Rashomon-like story about the events surrounding the Wonderland Murders of the early 1980's, in Los Angeles. The story is pieced together from the retelling of a few of the participants. There is story from the friend's perspective, namely David Lind (played by Dylan McDermott). He is a participant in the robbery assault at Eddie Nash's place (Eddie Nash is a infamous drug dealer - and is the suppose to be the same character Alfred Molina played in Boogie Nights) and is heavily into the drug scene. There is John Holmes' perspective (played by Val Kilmer), which makes him out to be a pawn stuck between two kings (with a severe case of cocaine cravings). There is also the patchwork recollections of John's wife (Sharon - played by Lisa Kudrow) and his girlfriend (Dawn - played by Kate Bosworth) that fill in the spaces between the two stories. It is basically the same time frame that we are looking at, just each character's version. The only thing that is missing is the perspective from the dead people. ",2005

8,"May 2004, Wonderland is fairly new in the UK. Brilliant film of a brutal true story. If you know LA from the early 80's, you will appreciate how well it is captured. The use of the elements which make up its gritty cinematic style is original, amplifying the experience and bringing the viewer very close to actually being there. The use of a disjointed 'Pulp Fiction' style time line allows exploration of the uncertainty concerning what really happened, while the direction and performances of the cast command attention, especially Val Kilmer as John Holmes; an Oscar for sure if I were handing them out.",2004

8,"One of the most disturbing and tragic periods in American history began. The members of the Summer of Love culture, at the end of the seventies and onset of the 80's, were eventually too old for love beads and all night parties and evolved back into mainstream life, whatever that meant. For those who could not out grow their youthful and sometimes irrational exuberance, their's was the culture of Wonderland. A love for drugs and a sense of entitlement coupled with a distaste for authority, values and ""the establishment"". ",2004

7,"A hard film to judge owing to its complexity, ""Wonderland"" tells the real-life story of the 1981 Wonderland murders in Los Angeles, which involved two sets of sleaze peddlers, linked by legendary porn star John Holmes (Val Kilmer). The film can be frustrating because the script is a mess. The story's chronology constantly jumps back and forth in time. And, although Holmes is a major character, other characters are just as important, but they are poorly identified, early on.",2012
9,"One of the most infamous crimes in the history of Los Angeles gets its day in the sun with this film by director James Cox. This is a fast-paced film that introduces the audience to several smarmy characters and presents their story in non-linear form. Anyone familiar with the actual crime will have no trouble keeping things straight, and I have spent some time this summer analyzing the events leading up to the gruesome early morning carnage, and the people whose lives were either taken, or forever damaged. This is a sordid tale dealing with some of the grimiest people imaginable. Would people still be talking about it if it weren't for the involvement of John Holmes? Perhaps not.",2013
9,"""Wonderland"" is an ugly, hard to watch film that gives us so many bad people ruining their lives with drugs that you have to wonder why it's an important crime story. Probably because the acting is so intense, it's the cinematic equivalent of a crack pipe you can't put down, even though it's burning your hands and you can't get ""high"" anymore. Be thankful when this is over that you don't have a drug habit. And if you're using, get help now!",2009
8,"I decided to qualify my association with porn by watching this film about the ridiculously well endowed, scatter brained John Holmes.",2009
2,"Presumably inspired by the success of 'Boogie Nights' and the nostalgia for vintage porn resulting from the recent mainstreaming of the industry, 'Wonderland' is one of the most pointless and grotesque films made in recent memory. Amplifying the disappointment is the presence of a superb slate of actors--Val Kilmer, Dylan McDermott, rising star Josh Lucas, Christina Applegate, Eric Bogosian, Kate Bosworth, and especially Lisa Kudrow--almost all of whom are horribly miscast, none more so than Kilmer, who bears little to no resemblance to the real John Holmes and whose performance is basically a retread of his overrated turn as another icon of '70s excess, Jim Morrison, in Oliver Stone's 'The Doors.' (There's a special irony in this fact: Morrison himself lived in a house on Wonderland Avenue, not far from where the murders took place, during the height of Laurel Canyon's popularity as a haven for rock stars.) Stylistically, 'Wonderland' is a bad knockoff of 'Boogie Nights,' the central character of which, Dirk Diggler (Mark Wahlberg), was closely based on John Holmes, and which also contains a subplot inspired by the Wonderland Avenue murders. Director Cox commits highway robbery, ripping off P.T. Anderson and Quentin Tarantino with so little nuance or originality that 'Wonderland' would look like the work of a pimply film school undergrad if it weren't for the presence of so many recognizable actors.",2005
8,"I was very interested to see this movie when it first came out in the theaters, however, I wasn't able to get around to it. So, finally, it hit the shelves, and I picked it up. Not knowing exactly what to expect, I plopped the dvd in the player, settled in the for an evening of murder, and pressed play. What followed was one of the more engaging flicks I've seen in the last couple years.",2004
5,"The porn star John Holmes was the idol of fans of X-rated movies in the 70's. His legend was based on his 14 in. length penis, and the number of women he had intercourse (about 14,000). ""Wonderland"" is an unpleasant inconclusive movie about his probable involvement with many scumbags in a savage murder of four people in Los Angeles. Although having a great number of good actors and actresses, the awful story shows only thieves, killers, whores, drug dealers and addicted persons, and therefore, there is no ""good guy"". In the end, I wished they were all dead. Further, the screenplay is very confused. The music score is excellent and probably the best in this movie. I have not recognized Christina Applegate in the role of Susan Launius (I have just read her name in the cast in IMDb). The second disc of the American DVD shows people from the porn-industry talking about John Holmes. When a lady said that he broke her tooth with his penis while shooting a film, I stopped watching this crap-documentary. The Brazilian DVD is single, and I hope the distributor has spared Brazilian audience of such waste of time. My vote is five.",2006
1,"I was excited when I heard they were finally making this horrific event into a movie. The whole era (1980's Southern California) and subject matter (drug and porn industry) is intriguing to me. I thought this would be a sure fire hit. I was not thrilled with the choice of Kilmer as Holmes, they do not resemble each other in physical appearance or mannerisms. I guess he sells tickets? However, I was willing to overlook this and give it a fair shot. I was a bit shocked that there were only like four other people in the entire theater with me on that first day of showing. Now the whole crime and story in the film is hard to do, I will admit that. There were no witnesses to this very violent and brutal act. John Holmes was there, but he was also a pathological liar and worried about what would happen to his family (and self) if he talked to police about it. In fact, Holmes never really testified about what happened and the crime did go unsolved. So this was still really one big mystery, a mystery that this movie does nothing to cast light on. The person writing the screenplay had a whole lot of discretion and most of the principal characters are dead. However, there is no real storyline, it is fragmented claptrap. The script is light and the actors try to hard to beef up paper thin lines by overacting. The film gives no insight into Holmes or the other people involved. Kilmer's character disappears for long stretches, his girlfriend is dull, the police are jokes. Even Kudrow tries hard to make a flimsy role look substantial. It is a very shallow piece and dare I say, boring. The director even tries to turn it into a love story. Which is nice, unless you know anything about what a piece of trash John Holmes really was. Perhaps a couple of viewings of Anderson's ""Boogie Nights"" might have helped here. ""Boogie Nights"" was innovative and exciting in all regards. This film on the other hand was flat and without any real charm or style. Even the music is out of place, with Duran Duran being played in a scene that was supposed to have taken place in 1980. Then we have Gordon Lightfoot? Gordon Lightfoot? There could have been a great film based on this gruesome event, but I have not seen it yet. I have not seen even a decent one yet (unless you consider the Rahad Jackson scene from Boogie Nights).",2003
1,"After watching this film, I realized even more, how great a film ""Boogie Nights"" was. ""Boogie Nights"" was able to depict the drug crazed Southern California of the 1980's so realistically and with such flair. The Rahad Jackson scene will live forever, I can see the little Chinese guy setting off firecrackers now. Then, we have ""Wonderland."" I think the director of this generic nonsense thought he could cash in on that excitement. However, he proves in a very embarassing way, that he is no P.T. Anderson.",2003
8,"I read a few of the comments regarding this show. As we're all entitled to our opinion, I have to say I thought this show was great.",2008
3,"No, I guess this wasn't for me. Before I start I should say I haven't watched more than 5 episodes, but I really didn't have motivation to keep going. The point is I could be wrong in some of my complaints. The reason I started watching was because of the reviews on here. You all seemed to think it was a ''exellent'' or if not a good series. Well- well, I'm gonna have to disagree. The number one issue is the character development. They're all flat and empty! Am I the only one who thinks so? As the story goes along we get to follow this extremely bored and uncharismatic girl that is trying to soak in to the whole ''being-dead-situation''. I'm not a fan of hers. I get that she's meant to be the way she is, but if you're gonna have such a boring and uninteresting head-character, you got to have other supporting roles to make it interesting to watch. Though, there is only one actor that felt real, and that is Mr. Mandy Patinkin as her ''teacher''. The rest of the supporters are flat and their dialog feels forced and unnatural, so does the dark humor the director miserably fails with. The Acting isn't that great either.",2014

Looks like someone came to their senses because They started to make a season 3 as of 2008... YaY. This show gives you a different look at life and death. Imagine if you were to become a Reaper when you died and helped others move on to a better place while you are stuck on Earth and not even allowed to have anything to do with your old life. The whole Idea of the show is interesting. The relationships between the characters are complicated and sweet in some ways. Each character seems to be in a family relationship, but totally alone. I think most people will find this show interesting, entertaining and will get caught up in this show.",2008
10,"What can i say about dead like me? Excellent, terrific and most importantly why the hell was it canceled.",2006
10,This series is finely made. The mock-traditions turn it takes is refreshing and it is comedically extremely well made. The casts' acting spirits creates a feeling and conversation easy to immerse one's mind into. The blend of talents from the cast and crew meshes smoothly and constructively in one of the most productive ways I've seen.,2006
10,"IMHO 'Dead Like Me"" is the all-time best television series. Of course I like off-kilter stuff that still makes sense and tries to build themes into the story. For those who have not discovered this gem, imagine a cross between ""Tru Calling"" and ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" that pushes the envelope of irreverence about as much as ""The Family Guy"". Then imagine that behind all the surface irreverence is a transcendent reverence for the human condition. If that level of complexity appeals to you, ""Dead Like Me"" is something you should immediately track down.",2007
10,"The type of show done exceptionally well by network cable that stays under the radar from the big entertainment news, but becomes a jewel nonetheless.",2007
10,"Dead Like Me is such a great series in that it gives the viewer a way to laugh at the greatest fear we all have, death. The reapers are all too human,... in-humans. They use their undead persona's to better their plight, within reason, under Rube's loose supervision. There are hints of teen rebellion, tempered by ironic twists where the children are more mature than the adults. Toilet Seat Girl, (Ellen Muth) is a reaper who hasn't experienced much in her short 18 years on earth. Her eyes are opened as a reaper to a world that she never knew, or gave a chance to. Her introduction as a dark, cynical slacker gives the viewer little reason to bond. Mason,(Callum Blue) the English teen who also died too young, starts her on new life by bringing her to a mass murder scene. She learns that to survive as a reaper, she'll have to work...At the very place where she died. Her inability to give up her family, who she couldn't stand to be around when she was alive, is one of the most touching aspects of the series. She becomes a far more sympathetic character, dead, than she ever was in her life. You see this through flashbacks of her short, yet turbulent life. Stewart Copeland's musical direction is spot on and the great characters from Roxy to Delores Herbig (""as in her big brown eyes"") carry this show. SciFi has been running the 1st season, hope the second makes it on. And oh yeah did I mention that you'll be rolling on the floor with laughter.",2006

10,"A cocktail of jolts, emotional and cinematic, on television. Can you believe that? First time in my life I've been glued to the TV (I grew up in Spain) I was amazed, compelled, moved and ultimately so happy. Things that used to happen to me but in a movie theater. Extraordinary performances a masterful direction and some glorious writing made it one of the most rewarding film experiences I've ever had, and I was at home. I don't want to get repetitious about the matter but I'm sure it influenced the effect it had on me. I could cry loud without refrain, I could laugh as hard as I wanted. The allegorical truth of the Angels in America were allowing my truth, the truth of my feelings, to come out. It allowed me to ""see"" my own feelings. Meryl Streep disappears behind each character in such a riveting way that I completely forgot that it was her, the mother, the ghost, the rabbi. Cohn's death in the hands, mind and heart of Al Pacino is absolutely shattering. He clings onto his life without being able to admit it. I've never seen anything like it. Mary Louis Parker, Justin Kirk, Jeffry Wright and the rest of the cast are just sublime. I will wait a couple of months and then I'm going to see it again. What about you?",2005

10,"Angels in America is an incredible example on how to adapt a play for the screen. Nothing is left behind and director Mike Nichols makes sure to get the best from each department. His great knowledge of cinema helped him to take advantage of all the qualities of this beautiful play. The way the story is told, the way characters are portrayed, the stunning editing just make this mini series a must see, something you cannot miss out. Moreover it is better than an acting class watching Maryl Streep, Al Pacino, Emma Thompson, Mary Louise Parker give life to more than one character each, changing their voices, posture, actions in a way a few actors can do. They are so well directed they just follow their actions and reveal the fantastic side of the play, where the imaginary world mixes with hard reality. There is no objective explanation for the angels coming to the earth, the audience has to find a reason, in the heart. As actors, filmmakers, director of photography you'll simply find this movie a great example on how to work properly, and that assuming that tvmovies are always bad is simply a commonplace, it's just a matter of doing your job well.",2005

10,"I will clarify something from the start. I am a white, straight male who has little time for wishy washy liberal propaganda. But this film is not propaganda. It is an epic of a quality rarely seen on the big or small screen. The film plunges us into a captivating opening scene of a wisened old rabbi giving a funeral oration about a Jewish grandmother he had never met, and takes us on some diverse and often surreal paths throughout the next 6 hours or so. The grand themes of politics, religion and sex have the time to be dealt with in a sometimes serious, sometimes very funny manner, and the acting is a treat. Every scene with Al Pacino is a joy to watch, and in particular his one-on-one dialogues with the gay black nurse played by Jeffrey Wright are superb. People who think this film is gay propaganda or an attack on religion should probably get out more and stop being so paranoid.",2005
10,"It's a challenge to recapture the greatness and immediacy that made the theatrical production of Angels In America so incredible. This HBO presentation managed to do that and more. The script was nearly identical, the directing and performances were as good or better, and now HBO could bring in wonderful special effects where they were appropriate (the appearances of the Angel, Prior Walter's hallucinations and Harper's trip to Antarctica). This production of Angels earned its seven Emmy Awards, and could have had more. It's obvious that everyone who was part of this undertaking dedicated themselves to it wholeheartedly. There wasn't a single bad performance, and some scenes, most notably Louis' recitation of the Kaddish prayer with Ethel Rosenberg's assistance at Roy's bedside, made me laugh and cry simultaneously. Being Jewish and knowing the prayer and the culture around it certainly helped, but I'm confident the power of the scene worked no matter what faith or background the viewer came from.",2005

9,"I've just saw this film on DVD and I think it's fabulous. It's nicely done. The subject isn't the lightest object in the world... This film brings the object with so much care. Al Pacino is great, Meryl Streep can play anything for my part, the woman is marvelous, Emma Thompson is great, everyone else plays their part so very good... It's frightening... It's not a simple movie. Not something to watch on a Saturday evening with your friends, in my opinion. This one you have to watch on a rainy Sunday-afternoon, in your pyama's on the couch. It's a long sit: six hours, but it's worth it!! HBO just did it again. I've seen many HBO-thingies (Dav one is Six Feet Under!!!) and they are all very good. When they keep on making films like this and series like my Dav, then I keep on loving HBO. Thanks to everyone who makes this film possible!!",2005
9,"Angels in America is definitely one of my favorites. I was a loyal viewer when it was on HBO, and rushed out to buy the DVD when it was released. I think this miniseries was very tastefully done. I was delighted to see such diversity in the movie. It was very refreshing to see Jews, Mormons, Protestants, Homosexuals, Heterosexuals, Republicans, and Democrats together. I think this movie was very real in it's portrayal of AIDS, and it really raised awareness for me, because it showed AIDS as a real disease, not just something we hear about on the news. I was very excited to see minorities presented like average, real people. I didn't see the play, so i can't compare. but i was thoroughly pleased with Mike Nichols direction, i think the cast was incredible, and brought life to each character in the best way possible. i think Mary-Louise Parker especially brought with her character, Harper Pitt, something to the play that was very difficult to do. Harper, other than her marriage to Joe, was irrelevant to the story; Parker was able to take the character, though, and make Harper one of the most insightful and endearing characters in the show. I especially like Justin Kirk in this movie. He did not have a particularly challenging part, but he really grabbed my heart in a subtle way. I have heard much criticism directed toward Al Pacino. However, i think Pacino did very well as is character. I have little knowledge of the real Cohn, but Pacinio was able to give Cohn an evil personality, while still keeping the audience aware of how human Cohn really is. It was very interesting. I was also very pleased with the characters of Belize and Mother Pitt. I found Angels in America very inspiring, and after seeing it for the first time, I seemed to see the world in a whole new light. I know that sounds cheesy, but it is true. For someone very passionate about equal rights, like me, this movie seemed to relay exactly what I stand for. If you are an easily offended Conservative, this movie may not be for you, but I recommend this to anyone with an open mind.",2004
10,"For those who are afraid of taking the dark journey into the soul of the mid-eighties AIDS epidemic, this adventurous film will not allay your fears of experiencing its brutalizing effects and the unrelenting aftermath that holds us hostage to this day. What is surprising about this movie is that it captures not so much the play's dramatic impact (a given with this production's pedigree), but rather the epic sweep, fantastical elements and brittle humor with a heart-pumping gusto rare for any movie. But this is no ordinary movie given that playwright Tony Kushner wrote a groundbreaking two-play masterpiece over a decade ago that serves as a sweeping indictment of Reagan-era homophobia, medical apathy and social ignorance. It certainly doesn't hurt that legendary director Mike Nichols has guided this ambitious drama with an amazing cast that only starts with Al Pacino, Meryl Streep and Emma Thompson.",2006
10,"Have just finished Angels In America. It's almost impossible to comment on this work right now. We are almost never graced with fare like this on the lowly TV. This isn't a mini-series...this is the best movie of 2003, in any media! Mike Nichols has taken Tony Kushner's miraculous play, added Meryl Streep, Al Pacino, Emma Thompson, the remarkable Justin Kirk, Mary-Louise Parker, Ben Shenkman, Jeffrey Wright and a remarkable supporting cast and allowed them to run with the ball! With a crew that any director would kill to have (espcially in the design/art department), and cinematography. Nichols lightly guides the play through what could be pitfalls to a superb climax. There are not enough superlatives to say what these people have done. No one BUT NO ONE should ever play Roy Cohn again. Al Pacino says it all and puts a 'finis' to the character. Meryl Streep, Emma Thompson, and Mary-Louise Parker are above reproach in their performances! Justin Kirk (Wow!), Ben Shenkman, Joe Pitt and, especially, Jeffry Wright are so 'on the mark' it's almost scary. I'm highly suspect about the motives of anyone who doesn't find this one of the most soul-searching experiences of their life.",2003
10,"Angels in America made me grateful to be open minded that I could fully embrace the whole film. There are so many people I could not share this gorgeous art with because they'd spend so much time judging the subject that they'd miss the spirit... which is exactly what they do to everyone they meet. I agree with other reviewers who felt they couldn't find words original enough to describe this movie but haunting, beautiful, enchanting. Those words start but just cannot touch the richness of this film. I lived in San Francisco from 1980 to 1989 and the meaning and feeling of this movie went to my very core.

It has suspense, tragedy, comedy, angst, inspiration, desperation, everything. I will be ordering it first thing in the morning. Exceptional performances by the entire cast, but you expect that from such high caliber talent like Pacino and Streep. I should say that I was very impressed by Justin Kirk's performance, since he got snubbed by some award nominating committee, which I thought was an insult since his performance had depth and dimension on a par with the rest of the cast. I was simply blown away by this story and if you haven't seen it, do so! Set aside enough time to get through the whole thing or you'll be climbing the walls waiting to see what happens next.",2004

It's even better than Family Guy (another great show, but which tends to get too sporadic, and even just plain dumb at times). It has hilarious characters and plot lines, and a razor wit.

10,"From the first episode I watched, the Venture Brothers has been a sure favorite. With it's wide range of humor, fun animation, and occasional David Bowie references, it never disappoints. The characters are vivid and endearing, and even some of the more gimmicky characters have surprising depth. The animation, which draws from classic cartoons such as ""Johnny Quest"" is polished and easy on the eye. All in all, the show has a little something for everyone. Complete with nostalgia, violence, and hilarious wit, both older and younger viewers will find something to love. As the title says, more people should see this show. It's a true gem among the hordes of reality TV stars and crass humor that television tends to resort to.",2011
10,"The show is a parody of 60's cartoons and their seriousness, the format adopted from Johnny Quest...an excellent humanistic portrayal of people who live too much of their lives in their imagination (a huge theme running through the show). A really funny show for fans of comics and or cartoons that can see the depth of them and would enjoy a candid look at what these things might be like if they were a reality. Very funny dialog composed well within the plot when good, and forgivable when it misses, excellent imaginative characters and rich personalities permeate the show, with much of it yet to be uncovered (as of august 2006). Shows the random incidents and moments that make up life, translated into a superheros world, making for some moments of real hysteria.",2006
9,"After the wake of horribly incomprehensible cartoons that followed in the success of Aqua Teen, a show with continuity and humor that doesn't rely on catch phrases and absurdity emerges. The humor and characters can be a little forced and juvenile on occasion, though, but it doesn't affect the overall feel or drag it down.",2008
10,"This show is probably the best mix of action/adventure and comedy for Adult Swim. The Venture team consists of brothers Dean Venture and Hank Venture, along with their father the once noble scientist Dr. Rusty Venture and their insane, tough as nails bodyguard Brock Samson. These four star is probably one of the funniest shows I have ever seen Adult Swim put on the air. Throughout the series so far they have fended off such hysterical villains as Baron Von Underbite and the always hysterical Monarch with his butterfly henchman. The episodes are always met with some high intense animation action and then some of the hugest laughs of all time. Check this one out, it always delivers a very stellar performance.",2009
10,"Jackson Publick and Doc Hammer are entertainment geniuses. There is nothing about this show that is predictable. Each episode surprises with it's characters, plot, comedy and outcome. In a world where no matter how ""good"" a show is, they end up doing the same thing every other show has done, with the same rehashed plots and jokes, or just pull plots from the newspaper headlines, this show is fresh. And that's hard to achieve when you start as a parody like it did. But at this point it's advanced far beyond parody. This show is so faithful to it's universe, the world Hammer and Publick created in season one, with such well drawn characters that continue to develop, each distinctive and layered with real personalities despite their comical stereo-archetypes, and with so much going on in 22 minutes, this show should be studied by all aspiring TV and film writers to understand the state of the art in screen writing.",2008

10,"In a time when cartoon humor has gotten out of hand and relies far too much on sporadic and disconnected humor, Venture Brothers steps up and restores faith in the medium. Each episode is a *bona-fide episode*, complete with a motivating storyline or exposition that supplements the humor rather than distracting from it. The best part is that the humor is situational and unique to each episode, and does not fall prey to topical modern humor or social commentary, nor does it go outside the boundaries of the storyline in which it is contained. The writing is superb, and I can honestly say that this show fulfills everything I've been looking for in a humor series. From the very first episode, each character is quickly developed and we get some very unique back-stories. The back-stories are woven into the episode seamlessly, and unlike other shows, become a boon to the episode and the character, rather than an interjection.",2006
10,"Ever since I first saw the pilot episode I've been addicted to The Venture Bros. It has yet to disappoint my wanderlust. Unlike my own writing it is fantastically written, witty, intelligent, and non-stop laughs make this the modern day equivalent of a funny cartoon. Dean Venture is a dork, wetting his pants at every turn. Hank Venture is a moronic wannabe tough guy, jumping of roof tops dressed as Batman while holding an umbrella. Doctor Thaddeius (sp?) Venture is a pill popping has been that can never live up to his family name. Brock Samson the Swedish murder machine voiced perfectly by Patrick Warburton. Doctor Orpheus, the over the top Necromancer with the lusty pig-nosed daughter Treana, and the Monarch, always my favorite. The Monarch is by far the greatest cartoon villain of all time. He's so fantastic that if I tried to explain his incredible delivery, fantastic lines, complete ineptitude I think your very head would EXPLODE!!! I highly recommend watching this film video entitled ""the VentuRe Bros."" on the network of cahtoons",2006

This show does at a glance run primarily on comedy/obscure pop culture references, but really it's all about the characters - who, in spite of our own expectations, we really do care about. Watch the series from the beginning, in order, and you'll get it. This show truly transcends anything else in the Adult Swim lineup, and it's a shame it doesn't get more recognition for it.",2011

Doctor Thaddeus ""Rusty"" Venture and his two sons, Dean (The more intelligent of the two) and Hank (Somewhat dim-witted and brash) along with OSI Super Spy Brock Samson go on a series of ""mis""-adventures, meeting along the way characters from other shows such as Johnny Quest (Now a painkiller popping pill addict) or the parodied ""evil"" twins of the Scooby-Doo gang. This is, without any hesitation, my favorite cartoon show ever. Not only does this show effortlessly keep my attention, but also delivers each of the situational elements with flawless timing and comic genius. The characters, though some derived from the parodying of other shows, are all quite original and each brings a flare to the show that would otherwise be sorely missed. Time will seem to flow much too slowly until the beginning and release of the third season of this amazingly funny show. Remember the days that cartoons were geared towards children and the only adults to watch them were either parents or those who refused to grow up? Those days are long dead.

6,"In my opinion, House of 1000 Corpses is a fan movie. Fans of both the horror genre and Rob Zombie are likely to love it. Though I do not count myself a fan of either, I do like both at times, and I am quite familiar with both. Those familiar with Rob Zombie are likely to be the only ones who completely 'get' this clever little film - appreciating its depraved sense of humor and nihilism. Zombie's themes are fairly consistent - evil (without the usual religious connotations and clichés), murder, sex, insanity, and stereotype ""hillbillies"". Zombie's world is not a place for people who are terribly concerned with reality, but, for Zombie himself, it seems to supply endless muse for a prolific and interesting commercial creativity.",2005
9,Its sad that a film as wonderfully made as this is so grossly misunderstood.,2003
9,"I already had a user comment for ""House of a 1.000 Corpses"" submitted here on this site, dated over a year ago andumnot very praising. In fact, my first viewing of this film was so disappointing that I excessively discouraged other people here to see it. Rather than to simply ignore the old comment and pretend I never bashed it, I wish to write a new – more positive – review, if it were only to convince other people (who also disliked at first) to give it a second change. Several factors (like the praising reviews on ""The Devil's Rejects""-sequel and conversations with fellow horror fans) nearly forced me to re-watch ""House of a 1.000 Corpses"" and I'm glad I did. This truly is a film that requires multiple viewing before one can properly judge it. Rob Zombie's style is often innovating and so overwhelming that it might look overly hectic at first but, in reality, his dedication towards obscurity and his knowledge on classic cinema is one of the best things that could ever happen to the horror genre. And that is something you (or at least I) have to discover with repeated viewings ",2005
1,**Spoilers**,2003
8,"House of 1,000 Corpses (2003) marks the directorial debut of Trash/Industrial Artist Musician Rob Zombie. This film was sitting on the shelf for a couple of years before Lion's Gate released it theatrically. A homage of sorts to Zombie's favorite genre, southern fried horror. Throw in Texas Chainsaw Massacre, add a little Eaten Alive and a dash of FunHouse and you'll get the flavor of this film. ",2005
1,"Is it possible that in my lifetime or for that matter in the tenure of mankind on this earth to see a film worse than this? This putrid piece of cellulose is terribly written,acted and edited. I remember Rob Zombie pimping this garbage and assuring us that it was so gruesome and gory that no movie studio would give it a go. I thought to myself,well finally somebody will scare the hell outta me like ""The Exorcist"" and ""Hellraiser"". Never been more wrong.Even with the obvious satirical overtones. This cinematic insult makes ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" look like ""Citizen Kane"".I have the feeling that Mr.Zombie went on a ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""Top Secret"" bender and came up with this pile of fecal matter. I understand Rob's fascination with gore,blood and the like,as I have seen him perform live with his band,and they were quite good,but for the love of God,Rob,stop making movies. There are absolutely no redeemable qualities to it. No scene stood out.No likable characters,just all annoying as hell. In short,if this movie was a meal,I'd spend an hour licking my dog's behind to get the bad taste out of my mouth.",2006

1,"All I heard about all year was how great this movie was, and how scary it was. I'm going to be very blunt and fair. It isn't any of those things. I was horrified, in a bad way. The acting was so bad I almost left the room, the gory violence was WAY too much, and it only seemed that way because it was quite fake. There was so many plot holes I lost count! This is probably the WORST movie I have ever seen in my entire life! As soon as it ended, I grabbed the disk from my DVD player, put it back in it's case and returned it for my money back (To my misfortune, we bought it) That's 2 hours I'll never get back, save your time and money and don't see it. If Rob Zombie is giving up his music career for this... I am truely sad... all in all 0/10",2003
10,"You like horror movies? Have you seen the original 1974 ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre""? If not, do yourself a favor and go watch it, and then come back and treat yourself to Rob Zombies wonderful homage ""House of 1000 Corpses"". The film is all homage and humor, but it would be wrong to call it parody. The film is really lovingly done.",2005
1,"This film does not merit further comment. But IMDb requires such. So... here we go. Hey Rob! Here's an interesting concept -- how about a story!? Have you noticed that the actors in the behind-the-scenes all praised Mr. Zombie? It is so embarrassing to observe actors gushing over how great their director is while (here is the key point) making the movie? Funny, but I don't recall seeing any of these lunkheads blitzing the press or talk shows doing the same after this crap was released to the general public and they were paid. Good grief, how far Karen Black has fallen. I see it took ""Halloween"" for Mr. Zombie to construct a film based upon a story and plot. Too bad, although not surprising, it was written by a real screenwriter and filmmaker named John Carpenter. Who in the world thought it was a good idea to throw money at this freak-show, Rob Zombie? Well, with all of that said, it remains a fact that if this bonehead can carve out a living making films like this, they by gosh... ANYONE CAN DO IT!!!",2007
10,"House of 1000 Corpses was well worth the wait. People were understandably a little sceptical of Rob Zombie's debut as a director, but knowing myself that the man is a scholar of the modern horror movie and a raving fanboy himself, I had high expectations of House. I was not disappointed. From the demented and hilarious opening sequence through to the surreal and terrifying ending, Zombie's first foray into direction and writing gives the world of cinema a much needed boot in the pants.",2005
2,"WOW, I cannot believe how terrible this film turned out to be. I mean borrowing ideas is one thing but completely remaking Texas Chainsaw Massacre? and badly to boot!  There were no scares, no gore, no nothing, just a bunch of people running around screaming trying to be scary. What a bore! It's like remember those lame haunted house rides you used to go on as a kid where you would pay tickets and sit in a car and it would go around in the dark while lights and buzzers went off and maybe like a coffin would pop open or a door would shut really loud behind you or something...now imagine watching 90 minutes of that.",2003
4,"I have to ask because it seems that I'm not a true horror movie fan if I don't like this movie. Thats a load of crap. I have seen all the Nightmare on Elm Streets, Halloweens, Friday The 13ths, Hellraisers, Evil Deads, etc. etc. I like film directors like John Carpenter, Wes Craven, George A. Romero, Eli Roth. I've seen some obscure horror films too, like Blood Beach, The Company Of Wolves and even seen The Last House On the left (even though I didn't like it that much).",2006
10,"This movie is about bad things that can happen if you are rude to strangers who are trying to be nice to you and fix your car for free. You can tell that the four teenagers are trouble. They think they're too old for Halloween, but then they act totally immature! They don't want to wear the nice home-made masks they get, they are getting a free dinner and hospitality, and all they care about is if their car's fixed yet. Then they complain about the really fun pageant that the Fireflies put on just for them! The girls are totally jealous of Baby, maybe because she's so much hotter than them, or because she tried on the dorky guy's glasses (he's all ""Hey! Need those to see!"" what a loser!) The one guy from 'Singled Out' screams and yells when Baby gives him this haircut, that he doesn't like. Even when Otis dresses up like Denise's dad to make her feel more at home, she acts totally ungrateful. Even though they all have really bad manners and are so rude to Mama and Baby, they still get to borrow the cutest-ever bunny suits and prance through the woods later on! You do get to see some nice moral values in how the Fireflies are pretty close, and they spend lots of quality time together as a family.",2005

1,"I have always considered myself a fan of b-grade horror movies and cult-classics.  However, this movie, I hope will never be considered either. Practically plotless, Zombie borrowed too many ideas from Texas Chainsaw massacre when scripting this musterpiece (meaning is that all he could come up with,) and lingered far too long on pointless camera shots in an attempt to capture an artistic sense of suspense(? is that what he was thinking??) ",2003
1,"I took a chance on this movie expecting a campy B-style movie that my friends and I could laugh at and enjoy.  What I got was a grotesque piece of cinema that should have never been made.  This movie is not scary, it is revolting.  Using the latest in latex, fake blood, and pretty much every make up technique at Hollywood's disposal this film is an hour and a half of mutilation- including gutting, scalping, disemboweling, disfigurement, and amputation.  No plot, no character development, no creative filming, just blatant maiming of each of the characters one by one.  I was never scared at any point in the movie, but it made me beyond sick to my stomach. ",2003
3,"House of 1000 Corpses has Rob Zombie written all over it. This wasn't created with viewers in mind, or how the audience would like it but rather he created it (both writer, director and composer) as his own love child of his own twisted, demented ideas. I mean the story is pretty stereotypical ripping off ideas from Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and a dozen other horror films. The sadistic family from Grandpa, to Mama, to Baby is a fun idea but then Zombie mixes it with some sort of stylized flashback, acid trip that makes the entire film annoying and unwatchable. I did watch the whole thing but I also fast forwarded through most of it and watched it that way and found it far more amusing. Fortunately it's short, and I was surprised that it wasn't as gory as I expected. I heard many people rave about the gore and horrendous death scenes and I mean it was pretty typical horror. I've certainly seen far worse as of late with Hostile, The Saw series and so on.",2006
4,"House of 1000 Corpses is a below average horror flick that's more disturbing then scary. When car problems force cross-country travelers Jerry, Denise, Mary and Bill to stop for a break, the foursome pull into the gas station-cum-museum on the night of October 30, 1977--All Hallows Eve. Though most of the group is wary of the stranger they find within, Bill is enthralled, for he is penning a book of offbeat roadside attractions. When Spaulding invites them to take in the Museum's premiere attraction--the Murder Ride--they embark into a world of darkness where ""Life and death are meaningless and pain is God."" But for these four travelers, this strange ride is just the beginning. The plot may not be original but it does sound like it has some potential. It didn't work out so well as the film isn't very good. I was expecting a good horror film that would be fun to watch but I didn't really get that. Rob Zombie directed and wrote the film and he apparently watched a lot of old horror films. The film just felt like a collection of old horror clichés. House of 1000 Corpses also gets really ridiculous at times and the film seems like it wants to achieve cult status, which it probably will. The acting was average with some performances being scary and others being terrible. The best was Bill Moseley and his performance was effective. The film is very disturbing as some scenes and images were defiantly very creepy. Its also very gory but that doesn't mean its scary. It also sometimes goes over the top on the gore. The running time is only 88 minutes long though it does get boring at times. There were a lot of horror flicks that were released in 2003 and this one is probably at the bottom of the list. There's a sequel coming out soon that I'll probably end up watching and hopefully they will improve. In the end, this is a predictable, unoriginal horror flick that's worth skipping. Rating 4.3/10, horror fans and everyone else should skip this film.",2005
3,"And the results, from my perspective, are mixed.  Many of the reviews on this site are glowing for the fun Zombie had with the gore, the violence, the chaos.  As a throwback to the Texans Chainsaw movies, I think it works partly well, with not an ounce of sympathy thrown to either heroes or villains (after a while the term ""villain"" doesn't give these characters justice).  But what made me dislike the picture was the staggering, constant use of editing in clips from other movies, other sounds, which after the first ten to fifteen minutes became a big distraction.  The level of terror is recognized, yet Zombie thinks in his writing and directorial debut, that he has to do EVERYTHING all at once, over and over, to get the audiences attention; it's understandable why Universal thought his film would get an NC-17.  For the most hardcore and die-hard fans of horror flicks and Rob Zombie fans, it's a treat I suppose, but for someone like I, who has seen many horror films and listened to Zombie's music, it's a little too much (the expectation levels from scene-to-scene are numbingly painful at times).

There is no character development and the characters make no sense what-so-ever.  The acting was bad, and the special effects were horrible. There was nothing scary, only occasionally gross.  The only thing even remotely decent about the movie (and I really had to dig to find anything good to say about this film) is the the blood usually look remotely real. There are numerous scenes that have nothing at all to do with the story and do nothing but take up even more time in this 90 total waste.  All aspiring film directors should study this piece of garbage to see what not to do.",2003
5,"In a nod to 70s movies like THE HILLS HAVE EYES and THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE (and others), HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES, while being the farthest away from even a decent slasher movie, does manage to weaken the stomach with its singularly twisted images of an insane family of cannibals who prey on a quartet of young twenty-somethings who happen to come within their reach and become fodder for their truly sick entertainment. Were it not for Karen Black, one wouldn't be sure these are actually actors playing their roles as if they were those barbaric, mentally defective sadistic killers, and while clearly Rob Zombie knows enough of movies to throw in a variety of references to Marx brothers movies as well as slasher classics, the very inhuman nature of the movie will be so forbidding that only hardcore lovers of this sort of movie will see it.",2005

He is a real genius and his mimicry (particularly of Robert Robinson) is brilliant. He is always at pains to point out that he does not know everything and his ""helper elves"" are supplying him with the facts. Alan Davies plays the idiot to SF's brainiac wonderfully too and the programme works because of their relationship. Other panellists worthy of note have been Jo Brand, Andy Hamilton ,Sean Lock, Jimmy Carr, Rich Hall, Bill Bailey and just about every guest that has taken part. It must be quite daunting to be witty and funny among the talent that turns up time and again for this show. My wife and I watch QI as often as we can when it is on and still enjoy the ones we have already seen over and over again. I always feel I have been educated, amused and thoroughly entertained and informed. As a lover of trivia this programme suits me down to the ground- it's almost perfect in every way.

Who would ever suspect that the great naturalist Charles Darwin once skipped cataloging a species, because he (and indeed everyone who came upon it) ATE the darn things almost into extinction. Who would imagine that rabbits weren't introduced into England until the 1300s and then remained penned up in enclosures for about 600 years before escaping into the wild (heck I didn't know they weren't native). This is a wonderful panel game (possibly an oxymoron?) and Stephen Fry, so beloved of the British public (and I think the Americans also, although perhaps lesser known here, but youtube is a great way to watch these if you can't get them on TV) makes a wonderful host; sometimes unable to contain the rambunctiousness of his comedic panel guests(which is just as entertaining as when he does manage to keep them in line).

Adam does a good job as well, both actors worked very well together and actually have great chemistry. I think everyone would agree that their version of ""I feel pretty"" was just so awesome and beyond hilarious. It was also nice to see that this wasn't a typical Sandler film filled with predictable cameo's of his friends, so it showed that he could carry the film without doing the common predictability.",2003
9,"This is a funny movie. When my husband and I went to see it in the theater we were actually laughing out loud. And it was not just us, it was everybody in the theater. Someone looking for a deep and meaningful plot will not find what they are looking for, however it is one of the best plots of all the Adam Sandler movies. It would also not be for anyone who would easily get offended by off-color jokes. Jack Nicholson is hilarious as the Anger Management therapist. He has some of the funniest parts in the whole movie. Adam Sandler is not to shabby himself as the not angry guy learning to be angry through a series of seemingly unfortunate and random events. ",2005
7,What is the funniest thing about this comedy? Adam Sandler? Hardly. The best thing about this movie is Jack Nicholson. he's the sole reason this movie is funny.,2005
8,"Let me just say one thing, before I comment on this film: Jack Nicholson is a star. I've heard bad things about his personality, lifestyle, bla bla bla, but, the fact of the matter is (no matter what kind of selfish bean he may be) he is a remarkably good actor. The way he can put so much life into his character, how he can make you believe this was an actual event, is amazing. He made the terrible ""About Schmidt"" a watchable (barely) film. And in his earlier effort, ""Anger Managemenet"", he plays the most annoying man ever to be put on screen (including that utterly stupid Gilligan) but, this time (thankfully!) to a brain-bustingly hilarious effect. ",2005
7,"Adam Sandler (Dave Buznik) is a mild mannered and submissive business man with an apparent knack for getting himself into unfortunate and disastrous situations. After a very small misunderstanding aboard an aeroplane escalates out of control, Dave is sentenced to Anger Management at the hands of Jack Nicholson (Buddy Rydell) ",2006
7,"This is a pretty good romantic comedy with silly bits tossed in (like the squeaky toy bear). This is the first Sandler performance I've really liked a lot, and while Nicholson is really just tossing it off, let's face it, his throwaways are frequently better than the best from most other actors. Here the match - Sandler at his most restrained, Nicholson getting sloppy - works very well, as each becomes a complement to the other, which is wholly in keeping with the characters and their situation. The supporting cast is also doing very well. And the film is well-made: possibly even too much so, as for instance with the cinematography, which is of a high quality that would suit a heavy dramatic film.",2007
10,This movie is purely wonderful slapstick. Jack Nicholson as the quirky anger management therapist Dr. Buddy Rydell and Adam Sandler as patient Dave Buznik. It's amazing to see how insane yet practical Rydell's (Nicholson) methods are. A great movie to see if you're a Nicholson and/or Sandler fan.,2003
10,This is the best Adam Sandler movie I have ever seen.,2004
10,"no, i really didn´t expect much, because of what i had read, and because i am not much of an adam sandler fan. however, i´m faithful to jack and see whatever he's done on film. and god, did i enjoy myself. i went to the cinema with my boyfriend and a friend of ours and all three were laughing on end. so did the couple next to us and the guys behind us. ok, i´m not saying that this was the best film ever, but given the circumstances, saturday night out after a week of work (including all saturday), this was just the film that made us happy. and we´ve been talking about some scenes for 2 days now. in fact, we´ve decided to buy the video once it´s out,because this will be just one of the feel-good movies one likes to see every once in a while. jack is great in what he does, and every bit of what makes jack nicholson is in this picture, sandler is good as well, as is marissa tomey (sp?). fans of one of these actors will be deligthed, others maybe not, but hey, it's comedy!",2003
2,"What could have been a nice little comedy turns out to be a complete bore. Jack Nicholson could not be anymore subdued in his performance here and Sandler, who should have been replaced with an actor like Jim Carrey, does his usual repressed angry man routine that simply falls flat on it's face. Nicholson is supposed to be a weirdo and a man of respectability at the same time but we don't really feel that he is all that credible as an authority and his weirdness is just annoying instead of being funny. He tries to provoke Sandler in some kind of pseudo mental health treatment but how is it that Sandler follows his advice even though he knows pretty early on that he is dealing with a nutball.",2005
1,"Anger Management is probably the best example of 'good actors, bad movie' syndrome.  Some of the best in the biz were in this movie, and yet, somehow, it turned out to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  One wonders how this movie ever made it out of the editing room.  How, throughout production, nobody looked up and said ""god, what a crap movie we're making."" Or why anyone signed on to make it in the first place.",2003
4,"Initially,the idea of Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson appearing together in a film called Anger Management looks good on paper.Unfortunately,what makes this a bad film is that the idea wasn't carried out very well.The story goes along smoothly enough,but what ultimately kills it is a it's totally ridiculous and disappointing ending.The whole idea that all of Dave's situations were staged as part of his therapy brought a very promising idea crashing to the ground with a thud.Perhaps Adam and Jack will make another film together one day,the story idea will be a good one,and this time the idea will be carried out a little better.Sandler has hits and he has misses.For me,this one goes down as a miss.",2005
1,"Don't go to see this movie if you didn't like Happy Gilmore or for that matter any of Sandler's past couple of movies.  I feel like it dragged, the plot was a disappointment after waiting for two months to see the movie due to the trailers that were played in theaters.  Jack Nicholson's acting was off I think because Adam is hard to work around.  He's a very boring actor that doesn't help the character have a personality at all.... drib drab character.  Marisa was disappointing too.. if you liked her in My Cousin Vinny... you'll hate her role here... Don't waste your money... wait till it's out in video...then waste it...",2003
2,"Although I was not expecting this to be a classic bit of comedy, I clearly had no idea that the script would be so weak that it could not be saved even with the best efforts of Nicholson and Sandler.  Within the first thirty minutes, I observed twelve people walk out of the theater; I managed to hold out for almost an hour.",2003
1,"Which you may or may not like.  I hated it. I found it embarrasingly unfunny, trying to make up for its lack of wit with strained sexual outrageousness. If you can't charm em, brutalize em.  An extremely nasty film, its target audience I suppose is adults who never matured beyond 14. Anyway, if your life is in your loins, you'll probably enjoy this piece of ignoble garbage.",2003
5,"The best I can say about Adam Sandler's films is that I don't hate them. Unlike many of his detractors, I find his humor dull rather than obnoxious. But I do have one pet peeve regarding his habit of stealing jokes from recent films then executing them poorly. A case in point: I found the 2000 Farrelly Brothers comedy ""Me, Myself, and Irene"" forgettable overall, but it did feature an amusingly irreverent scene in which an African-American dwarf limo driver (Tony Cox, who has made a career out of playing characters like this) goes berserk after a white character played by Jim Carrey offhandedly uses the phrase ""you people"" (in reference to limo drivers, not blacks). Nobody handles material of that sort better than the Farrelly Brothers, and what makes the scene even funnier is that the entire plot hinges on those words carelessly escaping Carrey's lips. This event causes a chain reaction leading to an affair, a divorce, and finally a mental breakdown.",2005
8,"Mostly silly, with Adam Sandler doing his usual goofy stuff, but Jack Nicholson - looking like Orson Welles - gives the movie exactly what it needs. There are some scenes that we expect in an Adam Sandler movie (e.g., someone eventually exposes something embarrassing about himself), but other parts really hit you. The whole ""I Feel Pretty"" sequence was a real surprise. And of course, there's some great lines, especially the ""phobe"" scene. Also starring Marisa Tomei, Luis Guzman, John Turturro, Woody Harrelson and Rudy Giuliani (yes, THAT Rudy Giuliani).",2006
1,"This movie was so predictable at every turn. I won't tell you why in case you wish to watch it. But it started out as a good idea, and with a few chuckles. But it never really approached the point of really funny. It was easy to figure out, and I almost fast forwarded at the end just to get it over with, but I watched any way, already knowing what was going to happen. If you enjoy watching the over inflated ego of Jack Nicholson, then perhaps you will like this movie. I for one prefer his classics such as Witches of Eastwick or the Shining. Heck, even the Bucket List was at least a feel good movie. This felt like an hour and half Saturday Night Live Skit to me.",2012
8,"Well, I usually don't like Sandlers' comedies, but this one is an exception.",2011
9,"I've just got back from Anger Management and I'm buzzing. I've read the comments and some reviews beforehand, and thankfully ignored them. There will probably always be criticism on Adam Sandler's movies, and many people hate them, but I can't help wondering what people are complaining about. Okay, his movies don't rank amongst personal favorites such as Fight Club or Requiem For A Dream, but they are entertaining, funny, reasonably original for feel-good-movies (except for the obvious boy gets girl scenario, but hey, even that can be nice from time to time (unless you're a cynic)), full of hilarious cameos and supporting roles, and you can see how much fun all the actors have in playing their roles and that they are having a great time doing these movies. And for me that's all I need if I want to have a good night out. Save the classics for when you're in the mood, and watch these movies once in a while so you don't get too serious about it all. And compare it to all the other comedy trash (romantic or teen) that come out every year and you'll see: in his genre Adam Sandler is in a league of his own. So for all the fans, don't miss out on this one, and for those out there that cannot appreciate it, too bad you don't understand it because you are the ones that are missing the point.",2003
1,Enough is enough!   Last Saturday evening I watched one of the worst movies I have ever seen -- Anger Management.,2003
1,"This movie looked like it might be fun from the preview, and I like both Jack Nicholson and Adam Sandler. There really is probably only one reason they were in this movie--for the paycheck. What a terrible, terrible film. It's highly uncomfortable to watch, features very bad Three Stooges humor, and is completely unrealistic. I don't mind stupid movies if they're funny, but this had only one funny minute in the whole film. If you feel some great need to see it, catch it on video. Just remember that you can't get those two hours of your life back. It's simply dreadful--full of exaggeration, stupid stereotypes, and cued movie music that tells you how you're supposed to feel. It's basically a typical big-budget Hollywood movie trying to take your money without giving you any real entertainment in return. If you want to see Adam Sandler in something sweet and funny, rent The Wedding Singer.",2003
1,"The few parts where this movie is somehow mildly funny are totally outdominated by the fact that it is criminally unrealistic. If you get the idea that what happens in this plot is therapy, or might actually work as a therapy, you're out of your mind... if anything this would be the best way to drive somebody completely insane. The only reason this illogic, unfunny, pointless, storyless crap sometimes gets good criticism is the fact that there are some good actors in it... It's just a really cheap idea, not even a new one, splattered across way too much time and resulting in a ridiculous, totally made-up ending that is impossible to believe if you got some sort of a brain...",2008
9,"I'm one of those people who tend to think that South Korean movies are perhaps a bit too slow-paced for my taste.

10,"I read a review about this movie and am aware what business it made in Korea, but nothing (I mean NOTHING) prepares me for this great work. With the exception of, perhaps, SE7EN, serial-killer movie has never been this good. The story (about real-life killings of 10 women in Korea during the 1986-1991) is compelling enough, but the actors (Song Kang-ho cuts you deep even when he's silent, and his big-city partner offers emotional jolts at the end), the director (effectively plays some scenes in docu-style approach), the cinematography (a shadow creeps out in the paddy field will give you, well, creeps. big one.), and the music (haunting) are welcome bonuses.",2004

The tempo, the thrill, the development of characters, everything it has been well worked.The direction is good yet without emphatic resources, there are just two moments with a little much use of slow motion but it doesn't arrive to be an abuse of it.",2004

It just sucked me in and didn't let away until the ending credits appeared. I'm really not a fan of this genre which is popular in various ""detective"" TV series but this film was something exceptional. A perfectly made detective film based on a real shocking murder case in S.Korea in 80's.

10,"Being a movie buff and a director in the making, I watched this film (with English subtitles, Korean not being my mother tongue), I was completely blown away by this piece of cinematic excellence. There is not a single thing about this film that I can think of in a negative connotation. I wouldn't want to give away anything about this masterpiece. All I would like to say is that this is a film not to be missed. If I want any of my movies to be globally renowned one day, I hope it resembles ""memories of murder"" in any form whatsoever.",2005

10,"Having seen a lot of good films this year, I picked this up after watching Thirst and wanting to see more of Song Kang Ho, remembering him being great in the Host. However, I was blown away by the fact that I never found this film earlier and while Song is excellent in it, the film and nearly everything about it is flawless in execution. The story about a detective in a small countryside town who finds a serial killer yet it's the incompetencies of the police force in general and human error which leads more and more murders. As the murders continue they find themselves powerless to use whatever clues they have to find the murderer. I'll leave it at that in terms of plot as it the film beautifully pulls you in until it's frustratingly simple conclusion. The cinematography is outstanding with a haunting score worthy of the film's amazing direction. I simply cannot find the words to describe how great this film is. I rarely watch films twice and never watched a film again without getting bored. On repeated viewings, you begin to appreciate the little scenes the director has put in and i didn't pick up one of the running gags until the third time though, they add little to the plot but are enjoyable and fascinating as the director chooses to move at his own pace. While not perfect, the quality of the film brings the smallest niggles to light and while there are only a few, this film does not get the recognition it deserves in the west, yet at the same time, it's like a little secret that is appreciated by those who are lucky enough to find it. As with any murder and mystery, you'll be looking for clues, even on multiple viewings but at best you'll be grasping at straws and jumping to conclusions until the frustratingly simple ending",2010
9,"This definitely is one of my favorite Korean films. On the surface ""Memories of Murder"" might appear as a simple cop-genre film. Yet underneath this costume lies an honest depiction of South Korea during the military dictatorship in the 80's. The lead actor Song Kang-ho's performance is outstanding as ever under the direction of Bong Joon Ho (The Host). The style and tone of the film constantly alludes and reminds the audience of the Japanese director Immamura Showei(Unagi, Vengeance is Mine), while the narrative structure seems too plotted according to the film's genre predecessors. For instance serial killer who gets stimulated by color red and rain while good/bad cop buddies come together in an expected fashion. However, I give 9/10 for its subtext rather than the film's outer appearance. Strongly recommend it!",2010
10,Memories of murder is a masterpiece.WOW! what a brilliant piece of film making!.The colors are filled with suspense and saturated with Korean attitude. I have seen a lot of movies about detective.

9,"It is difficult to know how best to describe the merits of this gripping yarn. The story is very well done; funny and horrifying, like life itself. the direction, action, lighting, acting, sound; all superb. The characters are entirely believable and engaging. While the movie deals with adult themes in an adult way, it is not in the least distasteful, even when for instance one hapless suspect is apprehended masturbating at a crime scene. The one sex scene is borderline hilarious and true to life. Funniest sequence of all is when the lead detective is looking in the sauna for the hairless suspect. And when he told the sauna staff to look out for the hairless one ""They just smirked at me!"" The various interrogation scenes are very well done. The conflict among the detectives is very convincing. The economy of storytelling is such that the viewer cannot afford to miss a single minute, unlike typical Hollywood pap where you could practically go and take a bath or a a shower, come back and you won't have missed a thing. A great, fascinating commentary on Korea at that time also.",2005

One of these rare exceptions is Jong Boon-Ho's Memories of Murder.",2016

10,"A crime-thriller movie has never been this better I think. 'Memories of Murder' offers some elements that some kind of crime movies don't have. First hour of this movie moves quite slowly, many investigations and jokes in it which is enjoyable to see. It shows how real-life detective investigates, makes suspect confess and sometimes cheats the evidence if it's necessary. And last an hour of this movie is so tense and brilliant, especially near ending of it. Bong Joon Ho shows his genius idea by adapted an unsolved true story into a terrifying and memorable film, also combining with some jokes that makes 'Memories of Murder' not boring to watch. What makes it different from other detective movies are some unclear evidence doesn't always lead it to the killer, perhaps it's just an accidental or coincidence. For me, 'Memories of Murder' is one of the best crime movie ever created and the one that could be remembered for a long time.",2013
9,"I recorded this on the Sundance Channel and knew nothing about it. Wow! It was such a treat! The story started out kind of slow and satisfying ... reminded me of some Hong Kong police procedurals I have watched. But then this cop from the big city shows up (the murders are happening way out in the countryside), and we start to see a really interesting interaction among the cops (the city cop, two country cops, and their supervisor).",2009
9,"Just everything from the corrupt cops to the subtleties of the acting was top class believable stuff. I loved how corruption was shown not to work but yet at the same time you understood why cops get frustrated with the job. It would be interesting to know if the songs on the radio evidence was actually true because it seemed very credible as evidence for the factory workers guilt. This is unfortunately the reality of policing when often they don't catch the guy and it is frustrating and not at all satisfying for them or the viewers. I still remember The Pledge by Sean Penn. That left me more dissatisfied than this film and i suppose it was because this smart university trained cop was pushed to this frustrating point where violence was his only release. The conclusion was understanding how difficult it is and also why morally crime doesn't pay. The violent cop lost his foot, the one for kicking suspects. lol",2007

I'm not a huge Ashton fan, but I do think he is funny, and this was probably the best movie I've seen out of the ones I've seen him in.

The trip turns out to be terrible as all these accidents start happening to them. Will they able to overcome these obstacles and stay married? The plot is pretty generic as there's really nothing new about it. Films like Just Married can sometimes be really funny while other times, they can be bad. Just Married falls somewhere in between. While there are some funny moments, there are also a lot of yawns. Ashton Kutcher stars as Tom and he does a good job. He usually plays the same character but does it well. Brittany Murphy plays Sarah and does a good job. She is a really good actress and one day will be a huge star. The material she is given in this film, just isn't very good. Christian Kane plays the ex-boyfriend of Sarah and he is trying to get her back. He is an okay actor, nothing special though. Shawn Levy directs and does an average job. Just Married is the type of comedy you would expect out of January, which is average and forgettable. The film is only 95 minutes long, which means it isn't too much of a pain to watch. The movie does drag sometimes though and so it feels like its longer then it really is. There are no memorable scenes or lines as you have already probably heard it and seen it before. There's really no reason to go and see Just Married. The stars didn't benefit from it nor were they affected from it in a bad way. In a few years most people will forget they have seen it. So there's no harm in watching but there are better comedies out there. Rating 5.3/10, a so-so comedy that's really not worth watching.",2005

Kutcher and Murphy do seem to have a bit of chemistry, and they do show sporadic flashes of real acting ability, but in all, this movie doesn't really go anywhere.

During my enjoying I never stop doubting what an inadvisable arrangement to tell us the come-off at the very first of the movie. When I am enjoying the final, however, I know that's the right choice. ""Courage is needed for loving a guy"", which is the beginning in a piece of fair-sounding Chinese song. In fact courage is needed for Tom and for Sarah as well in this movie. One side is the great disparity in their family background and life conditions, the other is the suspicion and even the disdain from Sarah's father and her other family members. The biggest frustration is what happened on their honeymoon, on which they began to doubt their marriage and some sorts of misapprehension exacerbated their distrust. Fortunately their love is true and lasting, which can endure no matter what kinds of disadvantage come forth. When they recollect with happy laughs and tears what has happened on their honeymoon, I think everyone can share their feeling at the same time. It is courage and lasting love that make and will make them crush through all of the frustrations before and after. God bless them.

As it aired on TV tonight(not even for the first time, either), I decided to give it a chance. The plot holds little originality, and it's not terribly interesting or engaging. The acting is fine, but overdone much of the time(seemingly more the result of the writing and direction than the work of the actors). The characters are neither likable nor realistic. They seem stereotyped and one-note, in spite of attempts at fleshing them out. Kutcher and Murphy have both given in good performances and been in good films, but here... well, at least they have fairly good on-screen chemistry. The humor mostly consists of mishaps, usually involving pain, with the occasional awkward and/or embarrassing situation. No observations, no wit, no clever references. Just unpleasant scenes. The pacing is OK. As clichéd as it was, I must admit that I liked the ending(formulaic and predictable as it may be). However, by then, it was much too late. A film that's just annoying and not at all funny, this is one you should not spend time on unless you're into the Adam Sandler type humor of pain and embarrassment being funny. I recommend this to fans of Sandler and his type of comedy. Everyone else should most likely just steer clear. 5/10",2006
1,Some movies have characters who act stupid but have some redeeming quality in the plot or the overall comedy or in great actors or actresses. This one had none of that to help with the stupidity of the characters and the scenes. Take every stereotype of frat-boy behavior and add the ugly American abroad and you're going where this film did. I enjoyed the childish humor in classics like Animal House and Blazing Saddles... they showed creativity and made us laugh despite the groans. This one caused the groans and left out the laughs. Why do actors and actresses allow themselves to be seen in such trash. They can't have been that in need of money. I couldn't watch it to the end. Suggest you don't bother to start.,2010
6,"This movie was OK. I could have sat through a mediocre movie if I get to see Christian Kane. There was a boring plot line, mediocre acting, Ashton Kutcher is just plain annoying. Britney Murphy somehow pulls this movie and Ashton out of the down slide running toward the dump. Ashton Kutcher is immature, bad actor, and if you paid money to see this movie-You just got PUnkd. I see the point or moral of the movie, perseverance pays off with a marriage. But a marriage to Ashton Kutcher---Is it really something you would want to save or leave that mistake in Vegas? I think the fact that rather than Christian Kane ""getting the girl"" and Ashton defeats him trashes the ending.",2005
4,"This film looked so insulting just from the trailers. By insulting, I mean that the jokes used were the same rehashed crap that is always used in these simple, romantic comedies. Naturally some people find it quite amusing; each to his/her own, I guess. Well, the film itself really isn't too bad; but quite frankly, it isn't anything really that good either. It stars Ashton Kutcher, who's credits include, Dude, Where's My Car and he will be appearing in the sequel to that film, Seriously Dude, Where's My Car, which is due out in 2004. Among Ashton's many other talents, he's one of the main characters on Fox's hit television sitcom, That 70s Show. It's really a shame this guy wastes his time on such stupid roles, at least in motion pictures, because he has some real talent. Brittany Murphy also stars in Just Married. You may remember her from 8 Mile, Riding In Cars With Boys, Don't Say A Word, and Summer Catch. She is a very talented actress and it seems that her career is far exceeding her real-life husband, Ashton Kutcher. No offense to Aston, but the guy needs to get off of his ass and do something good for a change. He has definite talent and he wastes himself on such pitiful roles. Sometimes movies like Just Married, or Dude, Where's My Car can be quite fun to watch. But that just wasn't the case with either of these films. Just Married is based on a simple premise for a film that has been seen many times before. Not to mention that the jokes for the most part are mostly simple, and provided nothing more than a simple chuckle at times.",2003

10,"This show is nothing but fun. You can only hope that some of the individuals who pass on these urban myths will watch this and start using there head when it comes to passing on these ridiculous stories. That being said, it's a lot of fun watching these guys use science, engineering, and art to debunk, or in some cases prove possible some the stories we've all heard while growing up. Well worth watching, for all ages.",2004
7,"This used to be one of my most favorite TV shows ever. It was the first show I looked up on IMDb so I could rate it a 10. It has never been entirely rigorously scientific, but that would have been too boring anyway. In the first seasons they managed to strike a great balance between sensation and scientific validity. Initially each episode spent quite a bit of time showing how Jamie and Adam constructed their experiments, which made it quite educational.",2014
6,"Okay, I sometimes watch this show because it was pretty entertaining. It was a pretty enjoyable premise and definitely a show that has a niche for doing some crazy stuff that you either see on movies or other such things saying ""Could that actually happen?"" Is there any part of this idea that doesn't sound even somewhat entertaining? Well it is.",2014
10,What a great show. One of the very few which have managed to make science and education fun.,2009
10,"This is BY FAR my favorite show. Period. Its funny, no, downright hilarious, and still educational. I love how different Adam and Jamie are. Adam is immature, funny, and goofy, while Jamie is sardonic, sarcastic, and serious but still funny. They go great together. Another great part of this show isn't just watching the experiments, but seeing how they made it, what problems came up with the experiment, and fixing them. So that is somewhat the educational part, but more so is that the are busting myths that are actually heard of. Like whether walking or running is better in the rain. So, basically, this is stuff that you could use in everyday life. But my favorite part of the shows is the massive projects that they do. Like say blowing a house up with bug bombs, or getting the life rafts on airplanes dropped from a helicopter. So its like the movie, Jackass, but for nerds.",2006
10,"What says entertainment like a little bit of science, a lot of destruction, and a man in a beret? It's easy to criticize the science on Mythbusters, but watching it is like being a kid again. Everyone remembers that wonder of finding things out or the fun of destroying other things. It's those two polar opposites that makes this fun to watch. Jamie is a proponent of the former while Adam is a lover of the latter. Among my favorite bits: duck's quacks do echo, just at a frequency that humans can't hear, ping pong balls can bring up a small boat from the bottom of the water, and almost every cool thing from a movie is impossible. Then, as if all this wasn't enough for the show, the second season put the Bust in Mythbusters with the introduction of the redhead with the great smile, Kari. Pinch me.",2007

9,"I am terribly and incurably addicted to MythBusters. This is one of the best science shows around! It presents scientific contents in a fun and interesting way. The hosts don't overdue the jargon and the results of all the tests are understandable to the layperson. Not only does one learn science, but everyone I know is taken back in time to their childhood when the big bully on the block made them eat pop rocks and soda telling everyone it would make them explode! Adam and Jaime are knowledgeable about all the myths they test as well as being simply fun to watch. The co-hosts, Grant and Kari, are just as entertaining. If you don't want to know the truth about urban legends and myths, stay far from this show. If you are just as interested as I am in knowing whether the ""5"" second rule applied to that chip you just dropped on the floor...tune in!",2006
10,"There is no way this show be rated lower than any other TV Show ! This show is real ! it shows real things and still excites every one! As an engineer, first few series were not that good, i was kind of thinking the technical way. But once you know you have limitations in house (i.e work place for them) then its pretty good. You do have limitations every where, you can never have a perfect build. Thats what they do, make the best fit and test it. They keep getting better with every episode and every season. Season 7 episode 1 was awesome. I found that episode more entertaining than the blockbusters of that year (any year for that matter). These people are here for serious entertainment, and also will tickle your mind, as to how far can you go in the best Lab conditions! 10 out of 10 is too little for this show, as this one entertains beyond any other TV series ever can! I term them ""gods of entertainment"" ! And last thing is - Kari Byron is very hot !",2009

I can't remember when i first started watching this show, every now and then i watch, but I'm too busy doing other stuff or watching my other favorite shows. Its fun how they research it and test it, i would love to do that kind of stuff, but they say DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME, EVER. My favorite myths were the pirate series, so much fun. It's interesting how they get along, even though they don't consider them selves friends,( Jamie and Adam) they still get along well together on the show. Classic show, i will always love it, i hope they will remain on the air for a long time. Grade A entertainment.",2008
10,"After several years on the Discovery Channel, Mythbusters just keeps getting better. Many people argue that their scientific standards aren't this highest, which may be true, but at least they get people to think about what they know, and question what they believe. The show is also remarkably entertaining because of the personalities, the subject matter, and of course, the occasional explosion. The programing on the Discovery channel is some of the highest quality on TV, and Mythbusters is one of their best shows. Keep up the good work Adam, Jamie, and team! By the way, this websites has results from all of the episodes: http://mythbustersresults.com/",2008
10,"I love this show. Mythbusters is about as good as they come when it comes to TV programming. The Cast is great, seem to know what they're talking about (as opposed to random TV personalities thrown out and given lines, while those in back do all of the work), and can tackle new ideas each time. It never seems like this show will run out of steam, despite the limited number of myths that they can do. The ""specials"" such as the Pirate, Superhero, and Shark myths specials are great, which is unheard of on cable TV. Usually the word ""special"" is enough to make you run away. I can't see this show going off the air anytime soon. Excellent show! 10/10",2007
5,"What a mess. There are clever ideas here and there, a few laughs, the occasional decent special effect (I saw this on TV so didn't see it in 3D, which perhaps would have made the generally disappointing effects more impressive), but the lame, tossed-together script and the lack of any cohesion to the final product make this only barely watchable. This movie seems to just be going through the motions; you can't even call it formulaic because it barely attempts to even stick with any formula, it's more like random stuff thrown in here and there. As for the ending, well, it's main purpose was to create an excuse (and not a very good one) to have cameos by everyone who was in the first two movies (allowing them to list Bandaras first in the credits even though he's on screen for only a couple of minutes), and the final showdown is so utterly moronic that words fail me.",2004
1,"This movie starts out with sub par visuals and acting and simply gets worse the longer this mess drags on. It amazes me how a movie with a budget of $38,000,000 could be this horrible. Some of the actors have at least mediocre talent and yet the end has visuals that look straight out of Microsoft word ""Word Art"". This movie would have been better if M. Night Shyamalan directed it! The plot is predictable, the acting is deplorable and the visuals are downright awful. If your children seriously want to watch a good movie show them something of actual quality.Personally I think that the rating of 4.1 is extremely generous to say the least.",2015
6,"There's little denying that the Spy Kids series wasn't brilliant. Far better kids' films have been made. Though I must admit, I have enjoyed them. They have proved to be extremely flexible with mediocre budgets and are extremely fun to watch. And Spy Kids 3-D brings you into the experience - anything in 3-D is brilliant, but I found this an overwhelming cinematic experience with the 3-D glasses. This may explain why Spy Kids 3-D did well at the box office. Although, saying that, the only really good thing is the cinematic experience. This film does have substance enough to keep you watching through the whole thing, but there's no denying that it lacks on the intelligence and is once again, a predictable affair. And there's no character development either - didn't either of the Spy Kids learn anything from their encounters in the game? There really isn't much to warrant a DVD purchase - though you can still view it in 3D on the TV, a lot of the experience is lost in the translation. Though to be honest, this isn't exactly a gem for your collection, but it isn't exactly a large mound of doggy do either. 6/10",2007

2,"Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over is a weak conclusion to the very entertaining Spy Kids franchise. Agents Juni and Carmen Cortez set out on their most mind-blowing mission yet: journeying inside the virtual reality world of a 3-D video game designed to outsmart them, as the awe-inspiring graphics and creatures of gaming come to real life. Relying on gadgetry, bravery, family bonds and lightning-quick reflexes, the Spy Kids must battle through tougher and tougher levels of the game in order to save the world from a power hungry villain. The plot sounds like it has some potential but the execution wasn't very good. I really don't have a problem with 3D but just because it is in 3D doesn't mean everything else has to be bad. The first two had good stories and were entertaining to watch. This one had a poor story and at times was too painful to watch. The acting took a drop from the previous film as most of the performances were bad. Sylvester Stallone did the worst out of everybody and I was wondering why he was even cast as his career is pretty much over. Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara play the two kids Juni and Carmen. In the first two, they give decent performances but, in this one they were awful. Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino don't really appear in the film which is probably better for them. There are also a series of cameos including Salma Hayek and George Clooney. Robert Rodriguez does a rather bad job of directing as the film looks like a mess. The script is terrible and predictable. The ending is really bad as it just seemed like some cheap way to include everyone in the film. The entire film felt rushed and they should had spent more time on it. The 3D isn't even that impressive and they focused on that then more than anything else. The film is also not very enjoyable to watch. When the film isn't in 3D, it gets really boring and most of the dialog isn't very funny either. The special effects were cheesy and looked really bad. The running time was a brief 90 minutes yet that felt a lot longer with the dull story. There is just very little to like here and I think they blew it as they could had made a very successful franchise {in terms of quality not money making}. In the end, this is a poor film and its better if kids and adults alike just skip it. Rating 3/10",2005
1,"Far inferior to it's predecessors, Spy Kids & Spy Kids 2, this third installment would have been a moderately entertaining - albeit enormously insipid - afternoon matinee, had it not been for the awful 3-D. There are newer, more advanced forms of 3-D entertainment, but director Rodriguez decided to go with the old fashioned 1950s variety - resulting in a virtually colorless mess of hazy images rushing past the audience's confused, aching eyes for an hour and a half. If they release a non-3-D version on DVD, wait for that and enjoy what little screen time was given to Ricardo Montelban, who steals what little entertainment value this stinker manages. Otherwise, save you money for a fall or winter release, when movies of any value whatsoever are typically released.",2003
1,"One day, I was in an mood to watch an action movie. I decided to go see this movie, I thought ""how bad could it be?""...Bad. I hated everything about this movie. Those kids were horrible actors, they were annoying, and they had bad lines. The story was lame, I mean they're called ""Spy kids"", they don't spy! The only thing that made them spies is that they had a bunch of gadgets. The whole ""guy"" thing was taken right out of The Matrix. I've seen some other Rodriguiz movies and I liked them. But dude, stick with adult movies, cause the kid movie thing ain't working'. I play video games, and that doesn't make the movie any more interesting. The FX were horrible, and my Dad does visual FX, so I know a thing or two about that stuff. All in all, if you haven't seen this movie, don't see it.",2006

When they were fighting each other with the robots and the camera was quickly panning in and out, that was cool, come on. And what about the race? That was awesome too!!! I don't know why he didn't have the rest of the family really return, but. All I have to say is this, Spy Kids 3 is the first film in years that I took my 9 year old son to and was glad I took him.

Instead of the usual 3-D films of today, which are mostly boring large screen pseudo-documentaries, or specialized environment theme park rides,: Spy Kids 3-D is a compelling franchise that the whole family can enjoy with added dimension that makes it even more exciting. Even though the film was theatrically presented in eye straining anaglyph format (red and blue), which, to date, is the most cost effective for a mass theater release and shot on a 24p 3-D High Def system (VIDEO) introduced by James Cameron, I found myself immersed enough in the story and just having fun with the genre to not really care. After all, I wasn't expecting James Bond. It's `Spy Kids' for crying out loud and they got away with it!!! Richard Rodriguez combined all elements of HD-making in a smart and acceptable way. Leave it to a cannonball gorilla HD-maker to get it done - thank god Miramax is here to let filmmakers actually create and control their own films with promise for distribution!! As a 3-D aficionado, I am hoping to see the movie in all its true-to-color and full 3-D glory one day as a polarized release or a well-mastered DVD release for virtual reality shutter glasses. To sum it all up.Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over is more than an experience; it's a milestone in history that will start a new revolution in 3-D Filmmaking. Kudos to Richard Rodriguez and James Cameron to a great start.",2003
6,"I will say this, the Spy Kids franchise was certainly a different piece of movie fare on the grand landscape of kids movies. Sadly, while Spy Kids 3D was interesting and different, it also proves to be rather shoddily acted and written. It seemed to lack the charm of the original movies, and while the 3D effects and the story seemed attractive and what-not, it just didn't fall through. This will definitely be the weakest of the saga, but fun nonetheless.",2003

8,"Swimming Pool is a first rate film from French genius François Ozon. This thriller makes best use of everything that makes cinema great, and it is therefore a delight to view. Swimming Pool follows Sarah Morton, a British author that travels to her publisher's dream home in France in order to have a rest while she works on her new book. However, her tranquillity is soon disturbed when her publisher's daughter; a sex-crazed, good time girl, turns up out of the blue and turns Morton's rest into something quite different. One criticism that could be, and has been, made of this film is that not a lot a lot happens. That, however, depends on your viewpoint; the action is stretched, but the relaxed tone of the film blends magnificently with the beautiful French scenery, and Ozon's attention to detail with the characters ensures that, although slow, Swimming Pool never descends into boredom and there's always something on offer for it's audience to enjoy. I, personally, was completely entranced from start to finish.",2005
7,"Swimming Pool contained good symbolism, acting, and especially great cinematography.  The movie was really too slow for me for the first 70 mintues, however, and I kept wondering, what is the point of painting us a pictures of this dour and unhappy author's interactions with a lustful irresponsible bratty young woman?  Although I admired the character portrayal and felt the movie visually artistic and even brilliant at times, I was not emotionally invested in Sarah Morton enough nor in Julie's to care.  However, the ending changed all of that.",2004
7,"Makers of erotic thrillers need to be careful, as that is a genre that, if not handled carefully, can quickly fall prey to silliness and excess (think ""Fatal Attraction""). ""Swimming Pool"" is a thriller in the style of ""The Deep End,"" and more than once I was struck by similarities between the two in their respective tones and reliance on water as a recurring visual motif. Also, both films have a middle-aged female as the protagonist who becomes involved in covering up for the actions of a child (in ""The Deep End"" a literal child, in ""Swimming Pool"" a figurative one). Also, both films are completely unpredictable. Neither goes the direction in which the viewer thinks it's going to. However, ""Swimming Pool"" is much more abstract, and its ending leaves you wanting to watch the whole thing over immediately with an entirely different perspective on the action. This gimmick always makes for a memorable ending in movies that employ it, but too often it makes the rest of the movie seem somewhat pale in comparison, and this is the case here. ""Swimming Pool"" plays tricks with your perceptions, but the finale to which the film builds seems somewhat anti-climactic when it finally comes. ",2005
9,"... Ozon lets us see his characters directly; and then through the mind of Charlotte Rampling's (as author) character. Two strands apply - the direct-to-Ozon's mind, and the indirect, via Rampling. And there the fun begins. We glimpse a gawky, immature, teeth-in-bands teenager (blonde) towards the end of the movie - Morton (the publisher's) daughter. But who has this blonde (Ludivine Sagnier) - who has she been? And how did she get to be in the house/novel/movie at all? Well now, let me see ... we learn at the beginning that Morton's daughter might well drop-in on the writer - as she is only borrowing Morton's house in the Luberon area of Provence. We 'accept' an idea of the incumbent blonde in all probability as that spoken of daughter. But she seems like a 15-year-old going on 35!!! She has an amazing amount of baggage for such a seemingly young girl. And she gets into such torrid, bizarre, and ghastly gargantuan fixes - all seem too improbable. The mix-and-match mode - as strand crosses strand, weaving a rich texture of reality versus illusion, fiction versus fact, and dream versus daylight - the enjoyment being in the management (in each viewer's mind) of the strands, understanding when the author's fiction is being played-out across the screen; and when we are back again inside the movie-director's mind (as opposed to one of his character's i.e the novelist). The local people encountered in the Luberon quickly become assimilated into Rampling's novel - their more outmodish acts being inventions of the novelist's mind (but being re-played inside an Ozon movie). And characters we might think are kith and kin of the 'real' people we encounter, are in fact nothing but kin to the fine imaginings of the typing hand. Ludivine Sagnier being the case in point - and she a cruel joke against Morton's dismissive inattentions towards our writerly heroine. The gawky, tooth-banded teenager has, in all likelihood, been in Provence all along - and in the projection of the novelist's mind - fashioned into a femme-fatale that makes the LuDIVINE we see on our screens, (and as the central protagonist of the Rampling novel, were it at hand to be read)!",2005

As if films from other countries than the USA should have to prove themselves extra... No way! On the contrary! Living in Europe, this isn't a foreign film for me! I was brought up in the sixties, and enjoyed the film-noir genre, the character movies, the French and Italian philosophical movies, the black-and-white films, the films made by the actors, the director and the plot together. So, Swimming Pool is a film that makes me sit on the point of my chair for more than 1 hour and a half. It is an intriguing story, the entire atmosphere is inviting, makes you feel good and being with Sarah/Charlotte all at once. The interference with Sarah and Julie is ambiguous. The continuing layer of lesbian love lays upon their relation, no matter what they do to each other in the beginning of the story. It's a kind of hidden suspense...

Her publisher John Bosload (Charles Dance) invites her to spend some summertime days in his house in a small town in France, where there is inclusive a swimming pool. He also suggests her to make the experience of writing about a different theme. Sarah accepts the invitation and travels to the wonderful and lonely place. A few days later, she starts writing again, but her quiet rest is shaken with the unexpected arrival of Julie (Ludivine Sagnier), the sexy daughter of John. From that moment on, reality and dream blends in Sarah's world. I did not dislike this movie, but I believe it is indeed an excellent idea, wasted in a very disappointing conclusion. There are many unexplained subplots and the story is completely open to the most different interpretations, and of course I have mine. But without reading any information or clue from the writer and director François Ozon about his real intention, it is impossible to give a precise clarification. Europeans usually like this type of story, but in this situation, the film does not give necessary hints about the real intention of the plot, and the viewer can speculate only. Charlotte Rampling has a magnificent interpretation, Ludivine Sagnier has a very erotic performance, but to become an excellent film, many clarifications are missing. My vote is seven.",2004
7,"I first saw this film on HBO in 2005 and now own it. HBO and others continue to run it. It is a very mature, engrossing film with a metaphorical plot. From the opening credits it immediately begs for your attention and once it has you in its grasp, you will find you cannot escape. A successful author of a series of mystery novels but bored with her work, Charlotte Rampling goes to the south of France for looking for fresh ideas for a new book, begins down one avenue and then changes direction. The location, photography and performances are exceptional as is the set design, replete with elegant simplicity that flows past your eyes. You are drawn in so well you can taste the wine and feel the pool's water flowing around you. The actors, especially Rampling and the actress who plays Julie, are impeccable. The Swimming Pool is a totally wonderful experience. Dive in!",2006
8,I first saw the trailer for this film at Fredddy vs. Jason back in '03 and me and my friend were in hysterics at how lame it looked. He recently bought me the film on DVD as a 'joke' birthday present but ironically now sits proudly on my DVD shelf as one of my favourite films.,2006
6,"I do not agree with the majority that the filmmaker intended the protagonist's stay at the house to be a creative hallucination. I think that there are enough narrative details to work out the whole thing. My view is that the girl who appears at the house -- Julie -- is the publisher's daughter, and that the girl who appears at the end of the movie in the publisher's office -- Julia -- is the child that he had with Julie (and therefore his daughter/ granddaughter). In other words, the publisher raped his daughter Julie, and the child they had is Julia. I took the point of the final sequence to be the writer's noting the similarity between mother and child.",2005
9,"You can see at the end that it is actually the one person who is seeing herself in two roles while she is in France - one as a nymphomaniac, fun-loving, rebellious girl that she has lost and the other, stronger personality of a frustrated, rejected, bitter woman. By the end of the movie, she has rediscovered herself as a combination of these two parts and can move on from her lover/publisher, one that will never leave his family, and start fresh as a whole woman. I think the symbolism of the murdered man is killing the man that likes the stronger personality, but cannot resist the temptation of a younger girl - just like her editor lover who cannot leave his wife but will indulge in side affairs. Killing him is getting rid of him from her life and allowing her to move on - which she does at the end when she moves to a new publisher. The daughter allowing her to write the mother's book is her giving herself permission to write about her own pain and rejection. This all comes together at the end when you meet the real daughter - the symbolism still keeps me thinking of each scene and what it actually meant.",2004

10,"Okay, I hate to give so much away but after watching the film, there's no other way to review in a way that it would make sense to the people reading the review other than to tell it like it is. Nothing is real except for Charlotte Rampling's character and her publisher. The daughter character is also real but you don't see the real person until the end of the film. When Charlotte goes on the vacation to the French countryside to clear her head, she actually enters into the world of the characters she is about to write about in her new book. The daughter, the gardener, the guy at the café are all characters in her book and she is living vicariously through them and their lives. That said, this was a very bold film. The soft porn elements were very strong but the acting on the part of Charlotte Rampling was stronger. She is a great actress of her generation and should be celebrated for such a powerful performance. I applaud her for her nude scenes and her honest portrayal of a character we see too less of in Hollywood, the sexy older woman who is not threatened by us young-ins! The film is about imagination and how the author uses it to solve her real life issues. My favourite line from the film is when Charlotte says: ""Hmph! awards are like hemorrhoids, sooner or later, every arse gets them"" LMAO! Classic!",2006

7,"A successful crime fiction author, Sarah, is suffering from writer's block and needing solitude and a change of scene her publisher suggests she take a spring break in his holiday house in the Luberon part of France, which she does and it seems to be working. Then the publisher's sexpot daughter, Julie, shows up unexpectedly and Sarah finds her presence, let alone pertness and promiscuity, a major irritation. To this point it is all perfectly believable, but then things start to become a little strange and, from a script point of view, rather ad hoc. For example, no explanation is given for Sarah finding one of Julie's bikini bottoms in the garden and why it should result in Sarah rummaging through Julie's belongings. The murder seems clumsy and pointless (and would leave a lot more evidence at the scene than that shown) and the disposal of the body rather pedestrian (not that more inventive methods in real life have prevented detection). The ambiguity presented at the end is designed to make us ponder whether it all really happened or was just a real-time fantasy with the eponymously titled book the result, unfortunately it rather draws attention to the script's shortcomings instead. On the plus side, the casting is good, it is nicely filmed and edited, the location is very pleasant and those who like the poster shouldn't be disappointed.",2005

I've watched a lot of Comedy Central over the years,and I've sen a lot of shows come and go on that channel,some good,some not-so-good. Outside of Chappelle Show(which imploded under CC's unreasonable production demands after just threes successful seasons),Win Ben Stein's Money(which was quietly shelved)and The Man Show(which disassembled itself after five seasons),the network has retained few shows it has rolled out since 1996,the year the Daily Show was launched. But this show has survived,and the quality of the product bears it out.",2007
6,"I watched the first four seasons, which started out being quite funny -- in the vein of Super Troopers: The writing was tight, the characters were likable, and seemed to hint at a layer of depth beneath the hilarity. That works well in a two-hour movie, but if characters aren't allowed to grow at all within a five-season TV show, the silliness can get old really fast. After a while, things started to get way too predictable, relying much too much on cheap gags and wacky twists to keep viewer interest than on actual plot/character development. The first episode of season 5 starts out with Dangle trying to ""jump a shark."" I stopped watching after that.",2014

9,"First off, I'll just say that this show is absolutely hilarious. Going into the show, it helps to know that most of the dialogue is improvised, while helps you appreciate that a lot of the good material is thanks to the actors themselves, not just the writers. Each episode generally has a main plot broken up by several shorter sketches featuring funny crime scenes and interviews with the officers. The combination of uncanny deadpan comedy, great improv work, and very creative writing makes for a great show. It has great rewatchability as you notice new subtle expressions and hilarious remarks within the improv. I would highly recommend purchasing the DVD's since you can watch the episodes in order and the special features are very good, specifically the ""uncut"" versions of some scenes, which is basically 5 minutes of the characters improvising off each other, then using the best parts in the show.",2006
8,"Wow. Movies like this are for me both a big surprise and a guilty pleasure to watch.

This movie proved me wrong and has rapidly moved up into my list of favorite films.",2006

8,"With the demise of box office power for the action man and a loss of interest from the public to watch the bad-ass hero, who says little but kicks a lot of butt, the kings of the genre Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sly Stallone and Willis's careers as action men seems all but over. Van Damme and Seagal were gone long ago. Should the main three want to do mainly action movies for the rest of the careers then they may need to do so in the DTV market. However, it does seem like the action movie could be getting a second wind. We have a plethora of new action heroes, none of whom will have the staying power of Schwarzenegger and also respected actors who play everyday men like Tom Cruise, Matt Damon, Nic Cage and Will Smith have turned in their fair share of action movies. The Rock does seem the ideal new action man, with his only real competition from wooden pretty boy Paul Walker and the now seemingly cursed to do crap movies, Vin Diesel (who in truth would be best as a baddie, like in Pitch Black.). The Rundown, while a box office disappointment has performed well on video but more importantly audiences really enjoyed it's delightfully 80's feel. It could almost be taken from Sly or Arnolds early career. It's not loaded with a hip new soundtrack, extreme sports or slick vehicles and loads of special effects merely to lure youngsters in to see it. It's modernised and stylised version of films like Commando (albeit much better than that.). The simplistic, one-liner laden films I used to love. Throughout the mid to late 90's as audiences got tired of that, and a lot of seeming re-hashes and Sly and co doing movies very similar to ones they had done before, meant that producers tried to give characters to these guys with more depth, without getting someone to write it decently and of course in the case of Schwarzenegger, trying to give a 3 dimensional person to someone who can't act. ",2004
6,"This movie will appeal to all who like action for the sake of action. ""The Rock"" does a moderate job of acting in this movie-but his performance would not win him any awards. I love the fight scene in the beginning against the football team. Overrated and improbable: of course...but it really appeals to the thrill seeker in me for some reason.",2005
9,"The Rock has done it again! He has made another big screen hit, and this time, he has used every trick in the book from the WWE. The results: The Rundown! Playing a bounty hunter is definitely a good role for The Rock. He doesn't play around, and I think he should thank Martha Stewart for the cooking ideas. Better yet, it should the ""E"" man; Emeril Lagasse. For the voice he lends to the The Rock's character. I liked all the scenes in the movie, and even though they were pretty fast paced, the fun factor was never lost. Take the jungle scene, where all the rebels fight Beck, there was a lot of action there. And I think the humor was the backup factor there too. Rosario Dawson provided a lot of quality as well. I liked the part where she gave Beck(The Rock) and Travis(Seann William Scott) some of that funky fruit. And then they had to wake up with the monkeys, with what Beck had to put up with earlier in the movie. Christopher Walken was good playing the bad ""a"". It was funny, when he had the .44 automatic shot out of his hand, and had to choose Option A, the hard way. This movie had a lot to give, action, adventure, and comedy. What more do you want? Rating 3 out of 5 stars!",2005
4,"Unrealistic, poor acting, terrible story-line what more is there to ask for? Well you get the rock and stifler fall down a 200 ft mountain face and not break a bone.. You also get to see the Rock do his best Rambo impersonation and get shot at a million times and not get hit. There is little in this movie that is worth spending the time on. If you are a hardcore fan of the rock or stifler then you might actually like the stupid dialog that between them for most of half the movie. So, take heed this is a comedy at its best, not much adventure and surely not anything worth any awards to mention of. The CD does have some good bonus features and is quite comedic by itself at some times.",2005

The governor, once the hot muscle-man in movies, turns to Johnson and comments: ""Have fun."" He passes down the torch to the next generation and in just the right movie. Since ""The Rundown"" and other early successes of his', he has become a movie icon and deservedly so. He just had to showcase his genuine talents in a great movie.

Christopher W. with thousands of Brazilian slaves digging a hole of the size of the meteor in the middle of the ""Brazilian jungle"" looking for gold??? Come on!!! Perhaps the director of the film thought there is no government in Brazil and anyone can open a gigantic hole in the middle of Amazonia. So what are we waiting for? Lets grab our shovels, lets fly to Brazil, enslave some Brazilian people and get rich!!! ",2006
3,"This has gotta be the most overrated action movie I've ever seen. ""The Rundown"" is basically one of those movie that have all brawn but no brains and Christopher Walken seriously needs to stop trying to play the bad guy because he sucks at it, and he sucked in ""A View to a Kill"", you can check that movie out yourself, because from then until 2003 he gave the most faceless performance of his career in that and in ""The Rundown"" he sucked even more and it looks to me that ""Balls of Fury"" will be even worse.",2007
8,"Well made action film; never pretends to be other than it is, a well constructed romp through the jungle. The photography is fine - very pretty countryside. Editing is sharp without getting flashy. In general, the direction is tight and the pacing good. The acting is very professional. Especially the Rock. His film career hasn't gone anywhere, because clearly Hollywood doesn't know what to do with him. But he has a natural acting talent and a natural charm and I wish he'd make more films like this before he gets too old for this sort of thing.",2008

First, We meet Beck(the Rock) a specialist retriever/Chef that wants to open his own restaurant. But his last mission is on the hot jungle of Amazon. well the things that we Brazilian always see on Americans movies about Brazil is that there's a lot of confusion on whats Brazil, whats Mexico and whats Cuba. But this movie by far presents the more accurate design for a Brazilian bar so far. So to the rest of the film: you are really gonna like this move for the action, the funny lines and the weak plot (gold statue in the amazon jungle, come on this plot is older then the dinosaurs) but in the end it delivers the funny moments you seek. recommended",2008

Well when the wait ended I was so happy because I absolutely loved this movie. The Rock is actually a very good actor as he has proved in his other movies prior to this one and the ones after. The fight scenes in these movies were great, and some of the very best i've ever seen. Sean William Scott did a great job and made me and the entire audience laugh the entire time. I bought this movie and every time I watch it with friends they love it too. Christopher Walken did an excellent bad guy I thought too. But overall this movie was great and I loved it so hands down I will give this movie a 10/10.",2007

10,"""The Rundown"" is hands-down the best buddy action/comedy ever made.  These types of movies are often hit-or-miss.  ""Midnight Run"" and ""48 Hours"" are great movies of this genre, but ""The Rundown"" surpasses both of them.  The action scenes are incredible, and the dialogue will often make you laugh out loud.  The cinematography in the movie is also pretty awesome. The one thing this movie does is prove to the world that the Rock is a legitamite star, who is capable of making great movies (and a MUCH better actor than Vin Diesel.)  The way that he and Seann William Scott play off each other in this movie is something that all people will be able to appreciate.  And as always, Christopher Walken is awesome. I would recommend that EVERYONE sees this movie.  In my opinion, it was the best action movie to come out in 2003 (barely beating out Kill Bill Vol. 1). Do yourself a favor and see it.",2004
4,"A scene-stealing Johnny Depp, can't save this bad excuse for a movie.

Antonio Banderas, way past his prime, once again plays the Mariachi. The Mariachi joins Sands, a CIA Agent, on a mission to foil an assassination attempt on the Mexican president.",2004
7,"Like ""Desperado,"" the film offers nonstop action and a gargantuan body count.  Robert Rodriguez knows how to please his audience, and the movie does work for the most part.  As expected in a Rodriguez film, the action scenes are very well-choreographed and all possess a certain slickness and originality.  Johnny Depp steals the show in his supporting role, and seems to be having the most fun.  I actually looked at him as more of an action hero than Antonio Banderas.  Then again, Banderas seems to be going through the motions.  After all, he has played roles of this type many times before and is probably almost bored.  I like how most of the movie is in subtitles. As I heard in the commentary, the reason for that was because most of the cast only spoke Spanish.  But I'd rather see Mexican characters speaking in their native language, and having to read the subtitles, than them speaking in a second language that they obviously haven't mastered totally. Hollywood appears to have a fear of subtitles, and it's a stupid fear.  Now onto what I didn't like about the movie...I'm not exaggerating when I say that it has nonstop violence.  I'm not one of these people who gets bothered by excessive violence, but after a while all that action and killing can get a little dull.  You just sit there waiting for the next body to fall to the ground.  The story isn't non-existent, but I think if Rodriguez paid a little more attention to developing characters and story, his films might be even more interesting.  But altogether, I was entertained.  You don't view a film like this in the same way you view a Kubrick film.  So what you see is what you get.  ",2004
7,"Once Upon A Time In Mexico is good, but not as strong as Desperado. Our hero, El Mariachi (Antonio Banderas) barely has any lines. Throughout the movie we forget this talented actor is the star of the movie. The explosive action is incredible, and including Sands (Johnny Depp) is the only thing worth raving about. Depp's role is actually the best part of this movie. Salma Hayek's role has been chopped to flashbacks, so there is not a lot of crazy Action and Romance between Banderas and her. You want Antonio Banderas to save the day and he does, but this Sequel did not give him that fire. Eva Mendes is in about 4 scenes but does a great job including the rest of the cast (Ruben Blades, Cheech Marin, Mickey Rourke, Willem Dafoe, and Enrique Iglesias). It would have been nice to hear some hot new songs from Enrique Iglesias for the soundtrack but I am more than satisfied with Salma Hayek's ""Siente Mi Amor"". It is an incredible Spanish track, worth watching the entire credits!",2005

The action is gritty, the action is spellbinding and the music, well it IS apart of the Mariachi series so, take a wild guess. Antonio Banderas - as great as he is in this flick he takes shotgun to Johnny Depp's lead. Depp as Sands seems like perfect casting and it's a thrill to see a great actor at the top his game. Selma Hayek - sadly - is not in this one as much and it is a sham, but since she was doing Frida we forgive her, and it actually makes for a more compelling and deeper action movie. El is trapped between a rock in a hard place when it comes to saving his people and saving his own neck. Has Robert Rodriguez puts it ""It becomes a battle of The Man with No Eyes, The Man with No Face and The Man with a Guitar Case"" and it's just that. Willim Dafoe gives a great and chilling performance, Ruben Blades is in top form and Eva Mendes is cold but hot none the less.

Johnny Depp in particular is thoroughly wasted in his role, but not much more so than Antonio Banderas and Willem Dafoe. Flashbacks, dreams,internal fantasies,imaginings, and some of the most ludicrous firefights in movie history are interspersed here with only the barest attempt at narrative. Near the end, when Johnny Depp's character has been blinded but is still functional and seemingly hardly the worse for wear, the movie descends into something close to idiocy. A complete waste of time, money, and talent. I now understand why there were only about 10 people in the 200 seat theater in which I saw the movie. The word of mouth on this dreck must be horrendous.",2003

Idiotic, nonsensical, inconsistent plot; horrible dialogue; terrible acting; scenes that are comical when they are obviously supposed to be serious, and vice versa. Where do something like 50 motorcycles appear out of nowhere in a crowded but otherwise peaceful plaza? How does Antonio Banderas jump backwards from a 25-foot church loft and land softly on his feet facing the opposite way? Why do supposedly dangerous criminals stand motionless with weapons idly in hand while Banderas beats them silly in slow motion? Why would a retired FBI agent suddenly ""activate"" himself, then walk around in the street muttering to himself as if he were wearing a wire? If you have any respect at all for the laws of physics -- or good acting, or even mediocre film-making -- this film will offend you.",2005

Come on, how can you have a blind Johnny Depp in a shoot-out and not get killed by the enemy. It's completely out of shape and a down right stupid movie that wouldn't be worth a penny. I was very upset to see the saga of the Mariachi come to an end in such a bad manner. I definitely give this movie two thumbs down on everything or should I say the whole enchilada. I don't blame the actors, but rather blame the people who had to do with the movie making process. This isn't a stab at the director himself, but everybody.",2005
1,"This film is just woefully bad. Robert Rodriguez has squandered all the talent of his cast with a ludicrous retread of ""El Mariachi"" and ""Desperado"". ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"" is nothing more than a string of action sequences interspersed with credulity-straining double-crosses.",2006
6,"Once Upon a Time in Mexico is sometimes enjoyable to watch but it gets a little cheesy and idiotic. Haunted and scarred by tragedy, El Mariachi has retreated into a life of isolation. He is forced out of hiding when Sands, a corrupt CIA agent, recruits the reclusive hero to sabotage an assassination plot against the president of Mexico, which has been conceived by the evil cartel kingpin, Barillo. But El Mariachi also has his own reasons for returning--blood revenge. The desperado returns with his two capable cohorts Lorenzo and Fideo. And the legend of El Mariachi reaches new heights of adventure. The first two were good but I felt that this sequel wasn't really needed. This film is pretty much plot less as it was just a bunch of different action sequences. The story was weak and it seemed like this film was only run by star power and gory action scenes. It works a little for this film since the actors on screen actually do a good enough job. Not all the actors are strong though but most of the important characters are. Antonio Banderas did a pretty good job which is surprising since I don't really like him. Salma Hayek was pretty good eye candy but gave only a mediocre performance. Johnny Depp gives a really good and funny performance. He probably did the best and he was really entertaining to watch on screen. Eva Mendes isn't in the movie very much and even though she usually is pretty good, I couldn't stand her this time. There are also a lot of other smaller roles played by talented actors like Danny Trejo and Willem Dafoe. Robert Rodriguez does a good job of directing really gory action but pretty much leaves out everything else such as character development. The action is done well and its pretty entertaining to watch. The film is very gory well not over the top gory but it sometimes becomes unnecessary. The movie is cheesy as the story is kind of dumb and so is the dialog. The film doesn't really get dull though as the 100 minutes running time feels short. This isn't really a film worth watching but its somewhat of a fun experience. In the end, this may be worth checking out on video as long as you don't want a good story but just gory action.

The only goal that isn't about revenge is that of Johnny Depp's. Which by the way gave the only good acting, I mean Willem Dafoe was practically dipped in chocolate to look like he did. I believe that the story could have been much better about a Mexican revolution and Johnny Depp trying to get the money. Instead, they put Inspector Gadget on steroids by having guns and bombs everywhere. Because I liked the main goal of the movie, getting the money when the government and guerilla are fighting, I give this movie a 5 out of 10 (very generous).",2004
5,"set in a present-day Mexico that looks like the backlot of a studio, this film trys to be cool and isn't. The story is simple, a coup against the President of Mexico organised by a drugs baron sees a CIA agent (Johnny Depp making the most of a weird role) recruit El Mariachi and his buddies to thwart the bad guys. There are various sub-plots like the drug barons Mexican Federal agent daughter, Eva Mendes doing her bit for girl power or the retired FBI agent recruited by Depp's character in another hairbrained scheme to see off the bad guys. A great cast including Willem Dafoe, Salma Hayek, Antonio Banderas etc etc are wasted because the director was not rigorous enough about the script, it sags with the weight of ideas, and lunatic marvellous camera work wasted on unimportant storylines and the whole thing carries no credibilty even as a tongue-in-cheek work. It's one of those can't make up it's mind what it wants to be affairs. It needed the tension of a film like Traffic's treatment of Mexico, with the comedy and violence of a spaghetti western but what comes out of the blend of talents is a A-team like story crossed with a Woody Allen's coup done in Bananas with the result the audience get to see a B-movie toting itself as an A-list affair. Pity because their are some good scenes but not the action scenes which are like made-for-tv efforts. 4.5 out of 10",2004
2,"What a poor movie!! A lot of flashbacks make this movie very confusing. The story and acting is very poor. With at least 10 killings per 5 minutes, this is one of the most violent movies i've seen the last time. Normally i like action movies, but this is just to much for my taste. I had big expectations, since i saw the commercials on tv.",2004
7,"A Wrinkle in Time - where do I start? The book, in itself, is one of the most fabulous, imaginative, fantastical stories ever penned. Madeleine L'Engle is a writing genius. The book opened up whole new worlds for me, and taught me (in the forth grade) that it was all right to have imaginings beyond anything ever heard of. Now, close to graduation, I watched this, excited, but prepared to be disappointed. I rarely was. This was a fine production - the child actors quite good, I thought - no gorgeous child actors were cast, and I noticed no huge personality changes. Meg doesn't wear spectacles, and there are other similar changes. The end is a bit altered, but it didn't bother me too much. This is a good adaptaion, but not for L'Engleites. You need to be flexible - one form is a novel, one is a film. A book can be directed toward a small group of people, but a film has to be marketable to everyone. See it if you like fantasy and enjoy Madeleines books.",2004
7,"I too am a big fan of Madeline L'Engle and especially the Murry family time-travel series; so I was both excited and trepidatious to see a film version of this well-known first book in the series, especially since it was produced by Disney (I love Disney, but I don't always love their adaptations of stories that were perfectly fine to me to begin with).",2007

4,"The book is so good that at least the opening of this made-for-tv movie will move you, but then, as it diverges more and more from the book, taking out all the religion and love and mathematics and putting in cotton candy cliches, it becomes boring.  Still, from comments I've heard, people who have not read the book tend to like it, and if it leads even on child to read A Wrinkle in Time, it will have served its purpose.  The most embarrassing change is to make the Happy Medium a clone of Mary Poppins' Uncle Albert (I love to Laugh).  Nothing is quite so squirm inducing as characters on the screen laughing hilariously at things that are totally unfunny.",2004
2,"I have grown up pouring over the intertwined stories of the Wrinkle in Time Chronicles. My dream was that one day a screenwriter would come across their child sitting in a large sofa reading A Winkle in Time, and would think, what an amazing movie this would make. Sadly enough that screenwriter failed, changing characters, throwing in lame humor, and all out destroying the plot. I know that it is a hard task to change a well loved novel into a movie. But why can't you stay true to the book? Why must you change the way characters think and act? For those of you who have not read the book, pick it up, find a soft couch, and let your imagination run wild.",2004
5,"True, L'Engle's book was far better. The movie itself wasn't so bad. I was quite pleased to see that Mrs. Whatsit was portrayed as the winged creature in a very satisfactory way. It was almost as though they pulled the image from my mind! Alfre Woodard was excellent as Mrs. Which, but then she's excellent in EVERYTHING. I was disappointed by parts, such as the Man with red eyes and Aunt Beast... and the end was slightly unsatisfactory as well. While I was a little upset by the changes, I would be pleased to see the other three of the Time Quartet (A Wind in the Door, A Swiftly Tilting Planet, Many Waters) be put to film. Maybe it would be better if New Line did it instead of Disney, though...",2006

To say I was disappointed with this film would be a great understatement.",2008

Also, the time period is noticeably different (with Mrs. Murry The filmmakers obviously did not take that into consideration. There're more differences, way too much to list here.

1,"I have loved this book since my 5th grade teacher read it to our class many years ago. And I have read it to every one of my 3rd and 5th grade classes over my past 18 years of teaching. Supposedly a movie had been made in the past, but I'd never been able to locate it. Well, my students and I were all so excited when we heard that Disney had brought Madeline L'Engle's excellent book to the screen. ",2004
6,"As adaptions go, this movie is adequate. It captures much of the spirit of the original book, and it makes good use of some excellent casting (the three child regulars are exceptional, especially Katie Stuart). Unfortunately, things are bogged down by too much uplifting music, and the modifications to the ending will have L'Engle purists fuming. You can see the evil hand of Disney in the final speech to the people of Camazotz.",2004
1,"A Wrinkle in Time is one of my favorite books of all time. It's incredibly intelligent, interesting, creative, emotional, and complex. The movie, on the other hand, is anything but. I know that a movie is unlikely to capture everything about a book. However, this movie goes beyond discrepancies between film and novel - it completely destroys everything that was good about the novel and turns it into a cheesy, simplistic, poorly-CGI'd nightmare. The character development is completely absent. Relationships that are interesting in the book are creepy at best in the movie. There are unnecessary departures from the plot of the book, and many good, complex, interesting scenes are deleted and replaced with strange episodes of physical violence, knife-throwing, and shouting. The animation is beyond atrocious - it's distractingly blurry and unrealistic, to the point of being comical. Seriously, do not, under any circumstances, waste your time.",2013
8,"I read this book when I was a kid and remembered it fondly enough to read again as an adult (when I discovered it has a strong streak of Christianity in it).  I don't recall any details (except for a couple not in the movie, including a 2D world and a little on Charles Wallace's development), so I don't know how much has been changed in the movie.  But for me this feels very much as I remember the book feeling.  It's a fascinating, magical story.  The acting is good, it has a nice pace, and while the special effects are tv movie quality it is still a very effective presentation.  I think the people most likely to dislike this are huge fans of the book, because huge fans of books almost always hate the adaptations, but on its own it's a marvelous production which I rate 8/10.",2004
5,"""A Wrinkle in Time"" is my favorite book. I have loved it since I was inelementary school, and as a 25 year old, love it even more. I grew up hoping that this book would someday be made into a movie, so I was very excited to hear about Disney taking the project on. My excitement faded when I heard it was not coming out in theaters, but instead, would go straight to television. For a TV movie, it's about what I'd expect it to be. I must admit that there is much to be desired with this adaptation. It's not nearly as faithful as the book as it could be, and there are some parts in the movie that I find to be unnecessary and out of place. My biggest disappointment was that many of the Christian elements of the book were excluded, making the story into merely just another (albeit brilliant) fantasy. I'd say that, generally speaking, the movie did a fair job of keeping the fanciful essence of the story. There are some things I didn't like, but I wasn't completely devastated. The acting was not anything brilliant. I was annoyed by the portrayal of Ms. Whatsit, but I thought Ms. Who and Ms. Which were pretty good. Meg didn't have glasses, which irks me, but I can overlook it. She wasn't bad, just oddly unemotional at times. Charles Wallace was portrayed well. He was very believable. The biggest disappointment was Calvin. The actor didn't seem to show much emotion at all. His dialogue seemed forced and rigid. There was chemistry between him and Meg, but I was left wanting just a little more. Overall, I do enjoy this movie, but my advice is, read the book if you haven't already. The movie was OK, but the book is absolutely phenomenal.",2005
3,"I got all excited when I saw the ads for this movie because I recently read the book and really enjoyed it. The movie, however, did not meet my expectations. Having read the book recently prepared me for big let down as often happens when stories are translated into movies. The characters didn't seem to fit very well with the book. The direction was weak. I had a hard time getting into the characters. There wasn't a real connection with the viewer about what was going on. The dialog didn't explain adequately what was happening. It just seemed slapped together and rushed through. All in all I was very disappointed with the movie. I suppose if you haven't read the book, it might be ok by itself. At the very least, it might entice you to read the book, which you'll probably enjoy more.",2004
1,"I really didn't like this movie because it didn't really bring across the messages and ideas L'Engle brought out in her novel. We had read the novel in our English class and i absolutely loved it, i'm afraid i can't say the same for the film. There were some serious differences between the novel and the adapted version and it just didn't do any credit to the imaginative genius that is Madeleine L'Engle! This is the reason i gave it such a poor rating. Don't see this movie if you are a big fan of L'Engle's texts because you will be sorely disappointed. However, if you are watching the movie for entertainment purposes (or educational as was my case) then it is an alright movie!",2006
1,"I was very excited to see that they had made a movie out of my favorite book ever. I didn't realize it was Disney until it was too late. I was appalled by the many omissions of crucial parts of the story. It was as if someone made a movie out of a 4th grader's book report on the novel. Meg did well in school and neither her nor her father wore glasses. Mrs Murray (Meg's mother) was not portrayed as much of a scientist at all; they left out her kitchen laboratory and replaced it with the internet. And that's just the beginning. By halfway through the movie I found myself shouting at the screen, much to the dismay of the other people who were watching the movie who hadn't read the book. I wish I had more thumbs so I could give four thumbs down for this one. The only good thing I can say is that for a person who has not read the book, this movie is kinda alright.",2006
9,"To start off I would like to say I am a huge fan of the book and was dying to see the TV movie but was preparing myself for a huge let down, especially when I saw Meg wasn't wearing the braces/glasses that I had come to associate with her. But guess what? I wasn't let down at all. It tremendously exceeded my expectations. The acting was phenomenal, David Dorfman was the perfect Charles Wallace and Katie Stuart was a brilliant Meg, and Gregory Smith was a gorgeous Calvin (In more ways then one *Drool*) the only thing that I didn't like was Mrs. Murry she looked the part but that was about it. The way she handled Mrs. Whatsit's arrival in the middle of the stormy night threw me off, and I also didn't like how they didn't develop her character at all. No Bunsen burners cooking dinner no physics genius mothers were portrayed. I know they could only put so much but I was tad dissaponted.",2006

If you are in the mood for a good laugh out of a not 100% stupid movie, then, only then, its a must see. I saw it a year ago and I still remember Johnny's face and actions. I must admit that really stupid movies make me sometimes angry, this is not that kind of movie that has no sense at all, it has a clear setting, and a great cast (perfect cast if you're talking about Johnny's selection). Probably better than the Mr. Beans, ""Johnny English"" is a must see for those who laugh easily. Another very important hint: don't watch it alone. Watch it with someone who makes you laugh. The last hint: if you don't laugh, probably Blockbuster® gave you ""Lost Highway"" instead of ""Johnny English"", a pretty uncommon mistake.",2005

7,"The talented Rowan Atkinson expands his character from a series of TV adverts shown in the UK in the late 1990's onto the big screen.So does the transfer from two-minute sketches adapt successfully into feature-length narrative? The answer surprisingly is quite well,although the film does have flat spots and gags that somewhat misfire.The plot and incidents that take place are an obvious mixture and borrowing from the NAKED GUN and AUSTIN POWERS series of parodies,but what is refreshing is that the character of Johnny English is mostly free of the occasional mugging that was witnessed in the above films,and also Atkinson's MR BEAN creation,which was of course wordless but did sometimes engage in some rather messy slapstick.There is some messy slapstick here,but Atkinson's interpretation is closer to his greatest comic character of Edmund BLACKADDER,with his sometimes cynical and sarcastic tone,though he has traits of bumbling incompetence like Mr.Bean,though not total idiocy which makes English more sympathetic.A lower budget than the AUSTIN POWERS series means there are fewer elaborate set pieces,but some scenes work very well and there are some witty exchanges of dialogue.There's decent support from Natalie Imbruglia,Ben Miller and Tim Pigott-Smith,but John Malkovich is the most amusing as the villain with his cod French accent.It is encouraging to see a comedy which underplays it's scenes these days,rather than performers shouting and screaming in a desperate bid to force laughter out of an audience.That said,some scenes in the film don't always come off,perhaps because they are understated too much,but the best bits are very funny(especially the final scenes)and further sequels with this character would be most welcome.",2006

10,"Johnny English is a great comedy that makes fun of virtually every aspect of super spy thrillers, from the car to the female secret agent who eventually falls in love with the protagonist. The movie concocts a ludicrous plot as a vehicle for the gags that will ensue, and it integrates these gags into the plot quite well. They got the right man for the job, too. Rowan Atkinson is excellent at portraying the completely incompetent Johnny English, who's sidekick, Boff is actually a better agent than he is. Yes I know, the whole sidekick-better-than-hero thing has been used before, but without Boff, the plot probably would have never advanced because English fumbles literally EVERYTHING he does on assignment. So Boff is to just move the film along while English's job in this film is to provide the laughter.",2003

UK viewers will remember some of the gags from the ads which are repeated here (the pen that shoots a dart for instance). However, this is a solid film that gains laughs consistently throughout. It will appeal more to kids than any other type of audience, and many of the laughs are from the slapstick style of Mr Bean than the verbal dexterity of Atkinson's best character, Blackadder. There's nothing really original or different in the way perhaps that there was in, say, Austin Powers 2 to take another Bond spoof as an example, but it's an entertaining hour and a half.",2003

I love it as a matter of fact. I'll never forget the episode where she had put on the fat suit and was dancing in the hallways, laugh out loud. Chelsea (Anneliese Van Der Pool), she cracks me up the way she never gets it. But she can act good enough I'd say. She just needs to get a clue though. And Eddie (Orlando Brown), he's great. He always gets mixed up in Raven's schemes. He's kinda like the innocent one. Corey is also cool. I love the way Corey is clever and is always doing something tricky. However, the parents, they're okay but the father, he's a bit too flat and I don't know how to summarise him but no, the show needs a new dad. The one they have, i hate to say it but HE SUCKS. One thing that always stands out is the teacher who spits, Mr. Lawler. One thing I don't understand is that when MR. Lawler is talking to them and spitting, in real life, a person would move away, I know I would. BUT THEY JUST STAY THERE AND GET CLOBBERED WITH SPIT! EWW! MOVE AWAY! That's gross. And you can see that it's real, these huge junks of spit pelting, gosh, that's so gross. I like that Raven Symone has made a comeback. She is a very talented young lady and I've watched her grow up from the Cosby Show to Dr. Dolittle to Zenon to That's so Raven. I love her, she's awesome. The thing I also like about the show is the way Raven always misinterprets her visions and does something stupid. And who could forget Stinky Sturkey, I mean Ben Sturkey. He must smell real bad to actually knock people inconscious. Disney constantly airs reruns of the show, so much that I only have to see the first scene of the episode to know what they're gonna say for the entire show. I think there should be new episode each week. But anyways, I love the show, Good Job Raven.",2003

Raven, the lead, is a good role model- not being skinny-to-the-bone- and that is the one and only thing I respect about this show. Speaking of the lead, she's inexplicably annoying and her voice grates on me. Her friend, Chelsea, is so stupid, but it's not the Joey-Tribbiani-type stupid, that is hilarious, but the annoying I-don't-know-anything-look-at-the-stupid-white-girl stuff of nightmares. The other characters are so boring I can't be bothered to write about them. The premises of the stories are ridiculous, and sometimes make little sense at all.

The best thing about the show would probably have to be the character Chelsea. She is by far the funniest character in the whole programme. The story lines are very predictable and some of the jokes aren't even that funny. I could watch a whole episode of That's So Raven and not laugh. It has a laugh track.",2006

5,"With ""That's So Raven,"" the Disney channel has failed another attempt to create a truly funny sitcom. The heart of the story (Raven's psychic visions) has proved to be a nuisance. The plots that unfold as a results of said visions are most times more ridiculous than funny. Adding to the sometimes absurd plots of the story, is the foolishness of Raven's actions. Her cuteness has since long gone since ""The Cosby Show,"" and, although a talented actress, her performance of this show might hint otherwise. The only thing that might save this show is Chelsea's complete lack of common sense; which provokes her random and funny ideas for solving the day's problem, which Raven hardly ever takes into consideration, using instead her own ideas which never work anyway. The character of Chelsea is casted well, and in my opinion is the only thing that gives hope to this show. I believe Disney has failed in the creation of this show. Especially given the successes of most of the other sitcoms that have aired, and are current on air.",2005
10,"I think that the show ""That's so Raven"" is a hilarious show for all kids and teenagers who like comedy because this show won't let you stop laughing for one second. Also, i think that Raven and the other actors/actresses on this show are very talented because they really know how to make people laugh, and how to act. This is by far, the best show i have ever seen on TV, the most witty and the funniest. I think that That's so Raven's episodes are all hilarious and you will want to watch them over and over again. I really recommend this show for everyone, and i hope that Raven and her friends will keep making more and more episodes because it's the best show ever. Great job Raven Symone and all the actors and actresses on this comedy.",2006

10,"I'm a sci-fi fan, but am pretty discriminating.  Often _years_ will go by where I don't like even a single sci-fi film that comes out.  This one scared and ""wow-ed"" me.  Doesn't just rely on special effects, but has a good plot and at least decent acting.  I don't see why this film was rated so poorly, unless other viewers didn't know ahead of time it had a strong sci-fi bent (I didn't).  Great storyline, eerie memorable scenes, and a complex background story that evolves slowly but consistently throughout the movie through flashbacks from the main characters.  Great way to condense the novel, I assume.",2003
5,"The first third of Dreamcatcher is worth the time.  Four childhood friends make their annual trip to a hunting cabin, weird things happen, and, before you know it, you're smack-dab in the world of Stephen King, at his most darkly comical and gaily grotesque.  It's flatulent, bloody fun on the page, and Goldman had no problem translating this hideous orgy of gas and guts from novel to screenplay form.  As the screenplay proceeds, it strays from the book to the point where the film becomes a Hollywood embarrassment of epic proportions.",2003
7,"Man, where does Stephen King comes up with this things? Again, we have the childhood friends we think we know from ""Stand by me"" only this time they're older, have weird powers and face some really nasty creatures. I just come from watching it for the first time and i just wanted to say: What a weird movie!! I've seen some really weird movies, but this one... It's sort of a mixture of horror, sci-fi, comedy... At some point you don't know whether to be disgusted or to laugh! The special efects are great, and so is the music (""On blue bayou...""}. It may not be a great movie, but it's great entertainment. And it's sooooooo insane!!!! I liked it. Go see it.     7/10",2004

7,SPOILERS!!!,2005
9,This movie will be a cult classic! I was enthralled with the four buddies and the first appearance of the alien was over the top. I had to look away the scene was ultra frightening. I have read a lot of bad reviews of this movie but I though the acting was wonderful The directing was good and CGI was great. I think a lot of people misunderstood this film because of the sub plots and genre twisting. I also thought Donnie Wahlberg is a gifted actor and much better than his brother. The cinematography was great and well crafted. It made winter into something beautiful. I would recommend this film for Stephen King fans and people who love SCI/FI Horror flicks,2005
10,"This is one of my favorite movies,I mean I love it.First off by saying,why do a lot of people hate this movie.I know it dosen't live up to the book a lot,but Stephen(the man)King like this film and he wrote the book.I just don't understand people this days. The acting was great,everyone played awsome.Morgan Freeman(Col. Curtis)played himself,but evil and I liked it too.Thomas Jane(Henry) played the role perfect from the book,to me.Jason Lee(Beaver)not only my favorite actor,but made me love the Beave more on film.He also stole the film.Damian Lewis(Jonesy)also stole the film and gave me the creeps,he's american voice was good too.Timothy Olyphant(Pete)reminded me of his role in (GO),but if he was nicer and drug free.Tom Sizemore(Owen)played Tom Sizemore,can;t go wrong with that now can we.Donnie Whalberg(Duddits)played the role and made me care for his short screen time. (WARNNING SPOILERS) The gore was in the house.Lending to the bathroom scene,the gore is nonstop.The Sh*tweasels are great special effects.Mr.Gray,two main forms are shocking.And the deaths are scary as hell. A great Stephen King film for does who haven't read the book.I LOVED IT.",2003
8,"I see this film has received amazing reviews on this site, but I liked it. I've never read the book, but I did read IT, and many other Stephen King books, and this story has elements of many King books, but mostly IT.  It wasn't a copy though, the story is very good, and original.  I think what hangs people up on this the fact that you have to use your imagination a little, something that nobody had a problem doing with IT.  The acting was very good I thought, Morgan Freeman's character wasn't very well developed, but he was excellent, Damian Lewis and the guy who played Mickey Mantle in 61* (I forget his name) both did great jobs.  Tom Sizemore turns in his usual performance, no matter how many different characters he plays, it's always the same character.  Anyway, I'm sure most Stephen King fans will love this film.",2003

6,"Dr. Henry Devlin (Thomas Jane), Joe 'Beaver' Clarenden (Jason Lee), Gary 'Jonesy' Jones (Damian Lewis) and Pete Moore (Timothy Olyphant) are best friends since they were kids. They have a powerful telepathic power, given by their weird friend Douglas 'Duddits' Cavell (Donnie Wahlberg). Every year, they join each other in the mountains in Iowa for hunting. While waiting for Pete and Henry, Beaver and Jonesy help a wounded stranger, with farting problems, and lodge him in their cottage. Further, they see helicopters in the sky, and animals very afraid leaving the area. Meanwhile, Henry and Pete have a car accident caused by a wounded woman on the road full of snow. Pretty soon they realize what is happening in that region. This film has a very interesting and intriguing beginning, recalling an X-Files episode. However, in the middle of the plot, it becomes an authentic `salad' of science fiction and horror genres, with ET's, monsters, lunatics and bizarre characters and many clichés. There are some scenes that happen without any further explanations. For example, why Dr. Henry tries to commit suicide in the very beginning of the story? How a leader can shot the hand of his man, like the crazy Col. Abraham Curtis (Morgan Freeman) does with one of his soldier, without any consequences? Why the team of friends apparently had not visited Duddits along all those years? What is the relationship of the powerful retarded Duddits and Mr. Gray? How could such a powerful ET be so easily destroyed? Why such a difficult to plant a worm in the water reservoir having such a spacecraft and being so powerful? Anyway, if the viewer do not think too much, this movie may be a reasonable entertainment for affectionate in sci-fi, horror and Stephen King stories like me. My vote is six.",2004
3,"Yet another failed King adaptation brought to the screen, completely missing everything that made the book good.

This movie should have been called `THE MAGIC RETARD FROM OUTER SPACE.'  Because, mainly, that is what was about, and I believe the screenwriter was definitely mentally impaired.",2003
6,"Dreamcatcher's first half is the best. It has the character interaction that is trademark of King's writing and the cast was chosen (and performed) well. The second half was ""science fiction neat,"" offering an action-based, and clearly established back-story (barely discussed) to the conflict between the invaders and the government, but it disrupts the psychological and personal mood set up in the first half. Ultimately, the fun/neat science fiction portion fails to deliver its apex in the way that you are lead to expect as it quickly ducks back into being a more psychological and personal story about the core people.",2005
10,Evil vs Evil two favorite slasher icons goes on each other Freddy vs Jason an epic battle fight. It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. Two titans of terror enter into a horrifying and gruesome showdown -- Winner kills all! This is the last good film and underrated gem in the horror genre franchise and it is my favorite slasher film I love it to death! This the last good Freddy and Jason film in which both the Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street franchises were both rebooted. This is the last Freddy movie in which Robert Englund performed the last time his character Freddy Krueger. I watched making off this film in 2003 and I saw an interview with Robert Englund reprising his role as Freddy for this film. ,2016

I had chased every picture, every piece of scoop I could find about this movie on the internet. It was very painful when ""Freddy Vs. Jason"" was finally released in June in the U.S. and I still had to wait until November until the film saw its theatrical release in Vienna where I live. Yesterday, the big day had come. Is there a way that a movie that's been so hyped by myself can still live up to my expectations? Abso-friggin-lutely!",2003
6,"When I saw the preview for it on space a few days ago I figured since two of the most popular Horror movie characters are in it, that it would be just as good as The Exorcist (which I saw just a while ago). Well I'll admit it was good, but it was nothing like I hoped.",2009
7,I thought that Jason and Freddy were fossils of the 80s.  I was wrong.  This movie works well.  I liked it better than the overrated Scream movies. Freddy and Jason make a great team.  This is an exciting movie with two cult figures meeting on screen for the first time.  The fight is satisfying. 7/10,2004
6,"That's what I felt after seeing this film, Freddy Vs. Jason.  Right when they introduced the characters I knew them so well, their personalities, emotions, motives and all, that not one human character could have (or would have tried to) surprise me with ingenuity in their performances.  So, that's the downside to Freddy Vs. Jason, a downside that will either poke the viewer harshly in the ribs, or will just remain as the typical, expectedly lame backdrop for the match-up.  I felt a little of both, though I tried to be confident that the main show would be worth the Hollywood-ish mish-mash.",2003
8,"I have some mixed feelings about Freddy Vs. Jason. It was a lot better than a lot of the Friday the 13ths (especially the amazingly bad Jason X), but it wasn't that great compared to some of the Nightmare films. Overall, it was enjoyable.",2003
10,"I have waited for this film for years and now it is finally here. I went to the pictures to see this on it's opening night (August 15th 2003) and when I left I couldn't stop smiling I had just seen the greatest one on one face off in the history of cinema. I loved it this was brilliant, this was the Freddy vs. Jason (although I believe it should have been titled Jason vs. Freddy like originally planned) I had always wanted to see but it was brilliant, it had great storyline, great actors (note: Ken Kirzinger did play a GOOD Jason but like most other Friday fans I would have prefered to see Kane Hodder behind the mask, oh well!) But to sum up I loved this film and gave it a vote of 10!",2003
10,"Freddy vs Jason is an awesome movie. If you love the Friday the 13th/ Nightmare on Elm Street movies, you will definitely love this movie. The fight scenes are excellent. The acting is that typical of the a Friday the 13th movies, which makes it even better. Could you imagine good acting in one of those movies? It doesn't make sense. I cannot wait for the DVD. It is going to be packed with bonus features. I also cannot wait for the next installment of Freddy vs. Jason, it will be equally entertaining.",2003
10,"This is the greatest film ever made next to the two Lord Of The Rings Films. Anybody comparing this film next to Jason X shouldn't because that movie gave god cancer.  Anybody who hates this film proably is taking this film to seriously.  This film is just a good time and i say bring on fifty more freddy versus jason films.  The great thing is that this movie solves alot of problems.  Just broke up with your girlfriend, watch fvj.  Parents just died, watch fvj.  Just got your ass kicked, watch fvj.  Its just like funniens who also solves alot of problems.",2003
10,"Every hard-core Friday the Thirteenth fan (like myself)knows what they want for the next one. Not in space, or in Manhattan, or even on Elm street--We want it on Crystal Lake. Don't try and fool yourself, you know that the originals were the scariest. I think New Line Cinema shoud f**k the Freddy vs. Jason 2 script and hire a really talented writer to come up with a kick-@$$ story where Jason kills at Camp Crystal Lake. The writer could continue right where Freddy vs. Jason left off (Jason burying freddy's head) and make it more like the original. Give Jason a motive to kill (like him guarding the camp). Hire a good director and cast and make the scariest da*n movie possible!",2003

10,"Okay, I've read various opinions of this movie and I thought that I should squeeze my 2 cents out. I've been anticipating this movie since I first heard about it years ago. Ever since I was six years old, I've been a Freddy fanatic. This style of horror movie was original and creative. Instead of him killing you in the dark at night like some cliche serial killer, he kills you when you are the must vulnerable...in your dreams. Now I'm not a big fan of Jason but that's beside the point. These are 2 of the horror icons from the '80's.",2003

It is really nice to know that the powers that be did not forget about the two villians that help upgrade the horror genre. Freddy vs. Jason was something that many of us hardcore horror fans have been waiting for and it did not fail to surprise me. The film gives a big salute to both the Freddy and Jason films. To bring these two together and give not just the chance of them working together but to give them the ultimate battle in which both they and we deserve. A good long gory battle that was full of buckets of blood that brought both of these men to this point. It was the most dramatic horror movie ending I have ever seen. I want to also say that I am really greatful to see FREDDY KRUEGER back on the big screen again, and to see him in a sence tipping his hat to his fans at the end of the film. Thank you ROBERT ENGLUND.",2003

This flick has the best fight seen I've ever seen this year(terminator 3,comes to second or a tie). The color of the film made it comic book like,which kinda change the way you look at the other films. I mean it even feels like your reading something out of a comic book. I still Think Kane should have come back,but Kin played Jason with a diffent side of him. His killing reactions were way to fast,which made me jump a lot. Kane is still the best Jason,but I would love to see his killing movements more fast. And Robert,will you never could go wrong with Robert. Even the jokes(which ruined the series)made him look good. I mean think of Freddy from part 1 & 7,but with more jokes.And kelly did way better at acting,then Beyonce. And I love the way they ended it with how Jason X and Wes Craven's New Nightmare got strated. Can't wait till this come out on DVD. LOVED IT.",2003

I saw the Jody Foster version when it first came out in 1976 and like that one, the 2003 version is an excellent all ages movie.

Although at times it seemed that way, at other times, it just seemed like Lohan was trying to be Curtis and Curtis was trying to be Lohan. Any way you look at it, Freaky Friday is a family-friendly film that tries to please everyone, and does. It pleases shallow teen prep girls because of Chad Michael Murray. It pleases teen boys because of Lindsay Lohan. It pleases older men because of a Jamie Lee Curtis thong shot. It pleases older women because of Mark Harmon. It pleases the whole family, being that they already saw Finding Nemo and it's the only other family movie out there.",2003

Curtis as a teenage girl is just as funny as Lindsay Lohan acting out the part of a grown woman trapped in her daughter's body. I loved this movie and it got great laughs out of me. I was actually able to sit in my room alone and laugh to myself without feeling stupid. So far, I've seen it three times and I don't think I will ever get tired of watching it, it just keeps getting funnier and more entertaining each time. Simply a masterpiece and I hope everyone who likes real real funny comedy gets to watch this one! This is gooood!",2004
10,"Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan shine in this absolutely wild and wacky comedy that will make you laugh and feel good. In my opinion, the way she and Annabelle (Lindsay Lohan) magically exchanged bodies was really creepy. This was because the earth rumbled when it happened. If you want to know how it happened, you'll have to see the movie. I said that because I don't want to spoil anything. If you ask me, the way Annabelle and Jake (Chad Michael Murray) met was absolutely romantic. Also, to me, he was an absolute charmer. I especially loved it when Tess (Jamie Lee Curtis) scolded Annabelle when she was making trouble. In conclusion, if you like Lindsay Lohan or Jamie Lee Curtis, I highly recommend this absolutely wild and wacky comedy that will make you laugh and feel good.",2005
8,"Freaky Friday, this was such a funny movie, and a huge surprise for 2003. This is actually a new favorite comedy of mine; Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan have such a great chemistry, I was really impressed with, new comer, Lohan's performance. She and Jamie just made this film an absolute blast to watch. I think I loved Jamie more though, she captured the whole essence of being a teenager perfectly, she did not over do it at all. Not to mention she's just an absolute pleasure to watch on screen, she's such a terrific actress, I love her so much. The story was just so perfect to update into today's society where everyone is so busy to even notice each other.",2004

9,"I am one who believes that a good film can be made very, very good by a single moment of spectacular excellence, a standout, blow-'em-away scene, maybe just two minutes long, that grabs you by the balls / heart and exudes some sort of sheer magic. Great films, I mean, truly majestic films (a club whose members you could count on your fingers) play at this level all the time, and I haven't seen one of those in half a decade. So we settle, well enough, for the shining, gilded tips that we can sometimes find in sturdy, self-sufficient films. These moments aren't great by themselves; take them out of their element and they're near worthless. No, these moments are great because the movie did the footwork in bringing you there, in setting up the big fall, the miles of development that gives that moment it's striking power. In The Usual Suspects you had Verbal Kint's revelation. In Requiem For a Dream, the climaxing montage of wrecked and debased humanity. And in Freaky Friday, in a measure of less gravity and only slightly less potency, we have too-uptight-for-her-own-good, conservative, forty-something Jamie Lee Curtis rocking out some killer power chords on an electric guitar. It's a moment of sheer unadulterated glee, of complete Dadaistic, fearless, uncynical and unfettered freedom that pretty much can exist only in the pre-slated innocence and silliness of a Disney film (which is probably their greatest under-appreciated asset). It is a moment of catharsis, of really breaking free, and where the movie comes full circle in its inner-child liberating mission.",2005
4,"Let's just get this out of the way. I do not like Lindsay Lohan. I think that, when it comes to singing or acting, she has no talent. The worst thing is, every movie she plays in seems to suck. Including this one. Freaky Friday is about a self-centered teenager played by, who else, Lindsay Lohan. The story is Lindsay and her mom continually has arguments. One day a woman in a Chinese restaurant sees them arguing. So, how does she fix it? She gives them magic fortune cookies that switch their bodies.",2006

8,"For teens I highly recommend this movie. It is much better than all the other Freaky Friday movies. This one was much more ""today"" and had colors that don't hurt my eyes to look at. Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis were perfect for these roles. I think the director did an excellent job at choosing his cast and re-making garbage, into something I could watch again. Especially Lohans little ""boy friend"" that's something I can watch over and over again. Her brother may have been perhaps the funniest part of the movie. In other Freaky Friday movies, I didn't really find anything funny, just dull and boring. It's also interesting how they change the ""body switching item"" each time. In one of them it was a watch or locket or something like that, and this time it's something different. It always is. I highly recommend this movie for just about anyone.",2005

You know Disney is desperate when they can't even come up with a fresh idea for a film. The idea of two people swapping bodies is so cliched that it makes me sick to think about it. Jamie Lee Curtis dresses up like a stupid punk with no taste, then of course, she switches bodies with her daughter, but I kid of course. Jamie and her daughter do very stupid-ass things to try and get back into their own bodies, such as body slamming each other... ha ha. And the little boy looks on and his facial expressions are supposed to pass as comedy... ha ha ha. Nothing in this damn, worthless, putrid, vile, pathetic film passes for anything remotely resembling comedy. Quite possibly because hiring REAL writers would have blown the budget since Disney is now having to settle lawsuits with poor people who get injured or killed in their deathtrap theme parks. Disney of course like I said earlier is too stupid and too dependent on stale, better movies to try and use them as a basis for their newer, crappier movies. In all honesty, ""Freaky Friday"" sucks the big one! Jamie Curtis has just sold out entirely because like Disney, she is a greedy idiot who will do anything to try and satisfy a lackwit humorless public.",2003
3,"Freaky Friday (2003): Dir: Mark Waters / Cast: Lindsay Lohan, Jamie Lee Curtis, Mark Harmon, Harold Gould, Chad Michael Murray: I am not sure why the emphasis is on Friday since it is the dawn of the weekend. Promising remake faltered by cheap sets and simple plotting. Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan play a mother and daughter duo whose bodies are switched due to a lame fortune cookie mishap. Curtis plays a psychiatrist who just completed a successful book. Lohan plays her rebellious daughter who plays in a band and serves detention often at school. They devour fortune cookies at a Chinese restaurant while in the midst of bickering and they switch bodies. This is totally lame in its earthquake effect. Directed by Mark Waters who had already made the embarrassing Head Over Heels. This is not much of an improvement given the fact that Curtis and Lohan actually pull off convincing portrayal, but they are trapped in a formula driven showcase that is beneath them. Mark Harmon is wasted as Curtis's fiancé, and the women at the Chinese restaurant are lame. Harold Gould makes a wasted appearance as grandpa. Chad Michael Murray plays the boyfriend whom mother disapproves of. Remake that toys with one's speech and habits while also addressing age, responsibility and parental role models. Unfortunately it is a remake that is hardly freaky on any given day. Score: 3 / 10",2015
10,"Besides saying that I really liked the re-imagining of Galactica, I just wanted to point out the madness in one of the recurring complaints I've noticed among fans *and* nay-sayers of BSG2003. I read a lot of people saying ""the new one doesn't have the humour of the original"" or ""it takes itself so seriously, the characters are too serious,"" or things to that effect. ",2004
10,"Yeah, I know: a superlative. Curses to you both Ron Moore and David Eich- you have made it impossible for me to watch ""Star Trek"" again. Not since the first ""Matrix"" film in '99 have I sat at a screen and gaped in awe at the push my brain was given.",2006

The sheer cold, clinical, detached storytelling style makes for an enrapturing viewing. The miniseries is what, 3 hours long?, and I didn't flinch once when I first viewed it.",2007

10,"I love everything about Battlestar Galactica. I used to watch the original as a kid but this is so much better due to quantum leaps in special effects since then. You feel as if you are right there on the flight deck or in the cockpit or in the command centre. Its easy to believe that Galactica exists somewhere 'out there'. I love the characters, they are so gutsy and real, the plot is excellently portrayed and leaves you gasping for more. I want to be a cross between Starbuck, Six and Laura and who wouldn't want to be mates (and more) with Apollo, Helo and Baltar. Such brilliant and realistic escapism is not always easy to find. The producers, writers and stars should be congratulated but I guess their reward is working on such an excellent project and knowing that they get to touch the lives of so many people.Even though we don't all get to fly vipers out amongst the stars we can pretend we do when we turn on BSG.",2006
10,"I expected very little of this Sci-Fi Channel miniseries, for I adored the original so much, but to my pleasant surprise this production is excellent. It doesn't fall back on genre-typical styles of film-making as we have seen repeatedly in Star Trek or other television dramas.  The editing is wonderful, the directing is above par, and the acting is quite convincing. I am especially pleased with the performance of Mary McDonnell as the president of the colonies.  Her portrayal is that of an ordinary human being thrust into power by extraordinary circumstances.  She doesn't overplay her strength and she doesn't fall back on 'exaggerated feminine emotionality' as so many female leaders seem to do in other shows.  The quality of her performance is also seen in the other actors, who are allowed the screen time to show us their personalities, rather than simply deliver trite one-liners.",2003

And after I watched the whole miniseries, I was blown away. A sci-fi show with no lasers? No elaborate, all too clean, spacecrafts? No weird talking animals? A sci-fi show that is actually relevant to today? Can such a show exist? Yes, my friend.",2006
8,"Those who are used to SciFi's standard fare are likely to be a bit bored by the realism, character development, intelligent dialog, and lack of explosions, mutant organisms and/or poor special effects. This is REAL science fiction, not cheap shock effects strung together with a mediocre plot. Hand-held photography- pioneered in groundbreaking series like ER and Firefly - has started to become cliché. Nevertheless, it works in this film partly because it is not overdone.

I made sure that every Sunday Night I would be there to cheer on my heroes, Starbuck and Apollo, to triumph over the evil Cylons. The initial cancellation came as a shock to me, especially since my friends and I would sit in the lunchroom on Monday and talk about the Battlestar Galactica episode the night before. When Galactica 1980 came along I had high hopes but was thoroughly disappointed with the series.

I could put up with making this version not as smart as the underrated television of the 70s.  That is what this is.  Making the Cylons look human is a rip of the Terminator movies and a lot of other sci fi shows.  But this mini series is boring. When the fate of the human race is at stake and you're not interested, something is wrong.  The series is also full of uncharimasmatic actors, especially that guy playing Baltar.  Only Edward James Olmos as Adama and that girl playing Starbuck escape mediocrity.  Mary McDonnell is the worst offender as the shrill President.  My advice: buy the original on DVD and read Richard Hatch's books instead.",2003

I have no problem with Starbuck being a woman (hey, I'm a woman!), actually I like it; however, the original Starbuck didn't provoke fist fights with officers.  He did much better verbally!  I noticed that one of the speeches given by the captain sounded very much like something I heard in Babylon 5; wording may have been different, but the speech was about the same.  I guess what I really miss is the ground-breaking approach taken by the original Battlestar Galactica....",2003

It's no wonder Nigerians are phoning Americans scamming for money. We are a nation of idiots. And she still does those ridiculous dances at the beginning of the show.

It's the same routine - bring in some band that you can get up and dance to or bring in some so-called amazing kid to interview and/or do their thing. Not interesting at all.,2017
9,"Ellen DeGeneres is one of the best known lesbian talk show hostesses around. That's because she does not use her show to preach or force people to accept her lifestyle. Her show has fans that range from conservative Christians to left wing liberals like myself who do appreciate that Ellen uses her show for good rather than protesting. I think that's why she went away. She allowed her sexual orientation to define her rather than having her own identity. I think she's better than that because she does admit to it upfront. Audiences do want honesty and truthfulness. They don't care about it but they don't want to be deceived or lied too. It's better to be clean and upfront about her personal life especially if you are doing a television show like this. While I think she's secured a niche in daytime television, she uses her comedic humor to poke fun as life in general. I think she's best when she's non-political because we already have enough politics for the next year with this 2008 election. I don't understand why she's winning Emmys because even though she's great most of the time. The show's momentum has passed. It can be silly, serious, and straightforward at times. She dances in the beginning because we don't get enough of it. Ellen might be a great role model for lots of confused teens out there but she is seen as a great role model for all of us because we don't have to grow up and stop having fun. I think that's what the message of her show is about, stop being serious and having fun.",2007
10,Ellen is the most talented actress and comedian in Hollywood. I never miss her show because she always makes me smile. I appreciate her humor and the emphasis she places on giving back to others. She is genuine and has not forgotten where she came from. I like that she is humble and that her humor is not at the expense of others. Keep up the great work because you are making lives better through your kindness and compassion.I have been going through a tough time and I know that for at least 5 hours a week that I will have a smile on my face and forget about the tough times.

9,"Many movies in the modern era have experimented with fractured chronology, but most of the time this technique is used for entertainment purposes only. ""21 Grams"" is an intense and thoughtful film enriched by this technique, taken to an extreme I've never seen before. We're not talking ""Pulp Fiction"" here, where a small series of vignettes are arranged out of sequence. Every individual scene in ""21 Grams"" seems to be distributed almost at random anywhere in the film. You have to concentrate when seeing this film for the first time, because you'll have trouble figuring out what's going on, and even as a plot starts to emerge, some of the details won't be understandable until the very end. But it pays off: this isn't like ""Memento"" or ""Mulholland Drive,"" where you may need multiple viewings to understand it all. By the end of this film, the story turns out to be quite straightforward. It's like seeing a gigantic jigsaw puzzle gradually pieced together.",2005
9,"A movie directed in inimitable style, Inarritu's 21 Grams is a provocative, deeply moving filmic work that explores several fundamental questions: What is a life, what is its value, and can we place a value on it? Directed in a series of small, seemingly disconnected fragments that come together as the film progresses, the film is thus shot in a style deeply unfamiliar to American moviegoers. At the beginning, most American viewers will find the choppy, nonlinear timeline distracting and frustrating - a cinematic form of coitus interruptus where once on the verge of revealing an underlying plot concept, the fragment abruptly stops and is picked up at an unrelated point. This style continues throughout, but don't worry. The answers do come after a while.",2004

9,"When lives collide, often no one is around to witness the effects of the collision. Alejandro González Iñárritu, however, has captured the profound effects in 21 Grams. How much does life weigh? Iñárritu may not answer that question directly, but he does indirectly answer the question darkly and beautifully in 21 Grams.",2004
8,"Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu made a well-deserved leap into the renown film-making pool with Amores Perros, and his follow up 21 Grams shows him with plenty of talent to spare. He also gets three (or more, depends on how effective one thinks the supporting performance were) forceful, compelling performances out of Sean Penn, Benicio Del-Torro, and Naomi Watts. They're involved in three interlocking stories- Penn as a mathematician with a rottening health and a near-rottening relationship; Del-Torro's found Jesus Christ after being in and out of jail for part of his life; Watts is a house-wife who may have some deep troubles within her mind. Each of the three leads doesn't go for cheap drama, and each one plunges the depths of their own abilities to find truths that might not be possible with lesser material or a lesser director. I won't say much more about the stories, however I do have something to say about the structure of the film. The script brings some mesmerizing scenes, ones with great tragedy that bring out a viewer's compassion. ",2004
7,"'21 Grams' tells of a number of loosely interlinked characters in an achronological fashion, jumping backwards and forwards over their stories. There can be reasons for doing this: for example, to reveal the plot in a way that offers an extra kick, or to enable the plot to conclude with a scene from the middle of the story that gains impact from the viewer's prior acquaintance with what happens next. Quentin Tarantino's 'Pulp Fiction' justified its own complex plot structure on both of these grounds. But in the case of this film, I couldn't see how telling the story in such a broken way was supposed to add anything; and the fact that most of the leading characters possess a death wish (or at least, very little will to go on living) hardly aided my emotional involvement. At times, the film appeared to be shaping into a story about the possibility (or otherwise) of redemption; but it never quite grew into anything more the harrowing tale of a number of people who suffer and (in some cases) die. The pretentious voice-over from Sean Penn's character that ends the film (and accounts for its title) felt to me like a desperate (and failed) attempt to inject some meaning into a movie strangely devoid of it.",2007
8,An unlikely freak accident progressively brings three people together to a gripping yet tragic conclusion.,2005
10,"Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu, becomes with "" 21Grams"" a master craftsman  that can push psychological boundaries and proves that to understand  the Americans, you don't have to be one. And very often foreign  directors that tackle American psyche do so in an intelligent and often  very accurate and sensible way. Even though this film could have had  characters from any country. Of course this is the case with the  director of this brilliant film. I had to see it twice under very  different circumstances and both times i left with a profound  satisfaction of watching a great film. The work of Sean Penn, Benicio  Del Toro , Naomi Watts and Charlotte Gainsbourg is superb. Overall for  me, the best film of 2003",2004
10,"I don't know how Alejandro González Iñárritu did it but he was able to not only get one, nor two, but three great performances out of his leads.

9,"This movie is very, very good. Unlike some others I do not think the unchronological storytelling hurts the movie, on the contrary I think that the pieces that the viewer has to put together in order to get the picture of the whole story just make it more interesting. ",2004
8,"I watched ''21 Grams '' after many people (friends and dad) suggested me that the movie was great. Well,the movie is intense, depressing, but it is good for sure: all the actors were great in their roles,specially Benicio Del Toro and Naomi Watts. Naomi, by the way, really surprised me for good, I am so used to see her in 'cute roles', and when I saw her as a young mother, crying in the hospital scene, when she finds out that her family died, I thought that she wasn't, after all, just a pretty face on the screen.

3,"A year or so ago, I saw a film about a horrible accident that affected three different parties. This film followed these three lives, and we saw how the accident caused their lives to intertwine. The film was directed by a man named Alejandro González Iñárritu, and was notable for it's gritty styling and downtrodden acting. The film was, of course, called 'Amores Perros'; but from the information given so far, it could easily have been 21 Grams. The only real difference between the two is that the first version of this story was massively superior to this retelling. 21 Grams has all the ingredients to be considered a great film by today's standards: a tragic story, lots of shouting...sorry, I mean ""powerful performances"" it's gritty, it's downbeat and it's even got the split method of story telling. However, there's just one problem; having these things in place is not the way to a great film. Ingeniuty, interesting stories, great acting - these are the things that make cinema great. I don't know what's wrong with people these days, why does stuff like 21 Grams always receive a strong critical reaction? ",2005

""did that happen before of after?"" and so on. you can just take any bad movie ever written, mix out the scenes randomly, and get a movie just as good as this one. just make sure there are enough naked women in it to make the guys happy. my opinion: don't waste your time.",2004

It attempts to be profound with the 'great' revelation that born again Christians aren't necessarily the greatest people, and that ex-cons really have a bad side underneath it all...uh really? You think? My patience was wearing with the highly overdramatized character of Christina Peck (Naomi Watts), as she wallowed in her own self-pity, skipping the normal process of grieving. And there was no more pathetic character than that of Paul Rivers (Sean Penn), whose obsessive, dying, math obsessed character made me wonder why any woman would find him attractive. The only character I felt any sympathy for was the beautifully acted and portrayed character of Marianne Jordan (Melissa Leo), who perfectly acted the pain of keeping together a family torn by abuse and alcoholism.

1,"If you haven't seen many movies you might enjoy 21 grams.  Otherwise you are likely to see straight through this rehashed plot. The only redeeming factor is the quality cinematography.  21 grams steals ideas from films like Magnolia and Memento.  It tries to make a simple story about people who make their problems worse, interesting by reordering events in time.  This is a popular fad in films these days which reminds me of choose your own adventure books, because this is how I imagine these films are created. Instead of providing real content the movie is a hodgepodge of gimmicks. A little life and death drama, some action, some mystery, some blood and guts give it a big budget -- Hey we've got a blockbuster.  To top it off the 21 grams premise is weak and never developed and has very little to do with the rest of the film.  You can leave this movie with the impression that you learned something about life, but just what was it?  Instead watch Amores Perros a quality film by the same Director/Writer duo.",2004
8,"Snapshots of tragedy: the lives of three people--a wife and mother of two, a dying man in need of a new heart, and an ex-con turned counselor at a religious center--intersect after a tragic car accident. The film consists of episodes in their lives (before and after the accident) which are shuffled about, with scene after dramatic scene served up--one may assume--in random order; yet there's a method to this editing madness, and the film's narrative actually feels much more linear in retrospect. Director Alejandro González Iñárritu is visually addicted to squalor (he sees the lonely beauty of it) and his film is unrelentingly gritty; this ambiance is matched by the performances of all three principles (Naomi Watts, Sean Penn, and Benicio Del Toro), each of whom perform totally without vanity. It is a remarkable achievement, with a few sequences of textbook dramatics completely recharged by the style, the desperate energy, and the emotionally gripping handling. ***1/2 from ****",2005

Somebody has to tell these directors that non-linear is not an equation for greatness. You first need to come up with something ingenious.

7,"The concept of this movie, which is that a young man has to do all in his power to stop his mother who is recovering from a heart attack learning of what's happened to Germany while she was in a coma, is absolutely delicious, but it's a premise that could easily go wrong. However, I'm pleased to report that it certainly didn't go wrong, and through interesting characterisation, a great script and some thought-provoking ideas; Good Bye, Lenin! is a winner all the way! An excellent ensemble gives way to a story that has a lot of heart, and one that makes it's points - both politically and otherwise - without the use of a sledgehammer. Good Bye, Lenin! is one of those films that is what you make of it; on the one hand, it's a touching and entertaining story of a boy's journey into adulthood and his love for his mother, but on the other hand; it's a biting political satire that intertwines themes of how our perception of certain truths can impact our lives.",2004

With wonderfully engaging characters all round, the film is endowed with a great sense of humour, both visual and verbal (and those Europhobic old Brits keep going on about how the Germans have no sense of humour!), it's socially relevant yet easier to watch than a straight comedy. The script is intelligent yet accessible to anyone, even a shallow teenager with no attention span whatsoever... yet IT is never shallow. And most of all, it's a deeply moving little gem of a film which however never abuses its secure grip on the heart-strings. I could see even my boyfriend was dewy-eyed at some points! And so was I, even more than two years ago. A small but perfectly formed film, it's actually not as small as one might think at first impact. Love (specifically, filial love) is its main theme, treated in a schmaltz-free, fresh, non-superficial and a non-clichéd manner.",2005
8,"This story has it all : family tragedy, growth (from child to adult and even growth as an adult), dealing with political and social change, and romance. I think the story gives one a good idea of just how much change occurred when the Iron Curtain fell over Eastern Europe and the difficulties and opportunities it brought. The story revolves around Alex, his sister and their mother. Their mother has a heart attack and then goes into a coma. During her coma, communism fell and then she wakes up. Advised by her doctor that she cannot take any form of excitement, Alex goes about creating the illusion that communism is alive and well. This often takes a comical twist on the differences between the communist east and capitalist west. There is also the subtle hint of discrimination by both sides against the other. In the end the story is about family and loved ones and what we are willing to do to make those around us happy. Go out and rent this movie.",2004

Jesus, when the huge Lenin turned his face and pleading hand to her as if seeking help it gave me creeps. What a finding! ",2005

8,"Both sad and funny, perfectly blended together in this brilliant dark comedy. Often stuff that I laugh at are the same that also seem kind of sad. But it's never in any awkward feeling kind of way, it always works fine and is really clever. I'm interested in history and even if this is about a emotional story the settings and some of the events that the plot progresses through gives a glimpse of Eastern bloc life, realistic feeling scenes of the fall of the wall and the quick changes in the former GDR. Actually more than just a glimpse. I must state something of what I think of these aspects of it. Very well done in creating a good feel and a believable presentation. Is this film pro-western? No according to me. I definitely feel it's a objective representation, not intentionally taking any stand. Even if I like it because of my interest in the history in which this takes place that doesn't mean that viewers not interested in those aspects will find it dull, absolutely not. Because the central think of this movie is an emotionally deep story about caring. The sad emotional points take a bigger part than I had thought, these thing are actually the biggest parts of it. Not criticism in any way, I just had thought that there would be more of a comedy. Not meaning that it's lacking in funny scenes, there are plenty and enough. This story is a emotional one mainly and the plot is unproblematic to follow. The characters really grip you. The stuff they are going through gets to one, to the level that you are at full attention to see where this is taking them. However even if like stated the deep stuff that I feel are the thing that takes it so high the plot line is pretty clever thought out. To the level of being unique? Maybe not but still brilliant in a way that some the ideas never feels overused. The acting is just as great as the rest which naturally was necessary for it to have the brilliant sentimental depth. Some films with a emotional tone, kind of a message can feel like a watch once film, not bad but kind of like it hits you once and it can't be the same the next time. Not so with Goodbye Lenin! cause it is not just an emotional journey but a amazingly entertaining piece of film overall. Goodbye Lenin is pretty close to the brilliant. Is it a masterpiece? Well no but I still can't really find anything to call a flaw. See this film and then you will want to see it again. 8/10.",2011

When she wakes, her doctor advises the family that her heart is weak and any problem could kill her. With a debilitated heath, her son understands that she would not support to acknowledge the end of her ideology and dream. Alex decides to hide the fall of the Berlin Wall and simulates in her bedroom that life has not changed in the recently integrated nation. ",2004
10,"This movie takes place in East Berlin just prior to and after the fall of the Berlin Wall. In reading some basic history of the German Democratic Republic (the GDR) I learned facts about how it was created in the Soviet Zone of occupation after WWII, about the Berlin airlift, the rule of the Communists, and the uprisings that ultimately resulted in German reunification in 1990. But all of this never gave me a feeling for what it was like to live in the country. Often it is a work of art that can best do that and ""Goodbye, Lenin!"" did not disappoint me in that context. Unless you were there, in watching a movie like this you have to trust the sincerity of the effort, and this movie seemed to be honest in its intentions and execution. It appeared that great care was taken to recreate the time period. But again, someone who lived through that era would have to be the final judge. ",2010

But I ignored your advice and I have been deeply hurt.  However, my decision to see ""The Cat in the Hat"" wasn't made haphazardly.  You see, three years ago all of you critics said that we should all avoid the ""calamity"" known as ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"".  Then some friends of mine took me to see it and it turned out to be a colorful, funny and almost hypnotic yuletide treat.

1,"If you liked the Grinch movie... go watch that again, because this was no where near as good a Seussian movie translation. Mike Myers' Cat is probably the most annoying character to ""grace"" the screen in recent times. His voice/accent is terrible and he laughs at his own jokes with an awful weasing sound, which is about the only laughing I heard at the theater. Not even the kids liked this one folks, and kids laugh at anything now. Save your money and go see Looney Tunes: Back in Action if you're really looking for a fun holiday family movie.",2003
2,"This movie was physically painful to sit through, maybe because (like many people my age, and younger) I grew up with Dr. Seuss and loved his books - funny, clever, whimsical and subversive at the same time. ""The Cat in the Hat"" sucks all of the interest and spark out of the story, and Mike Myer's performance as the Cat is mostly bewildering. Why the Borscht Belt accent, the unfunny patter, the inappropriate jokes, the charmless costume? I had to go back and re-read the books to see the real problem: the books are SIMPLE. This movie is OVERBLOWN and way, way too long.",2005

I actually liked it ever since I first watched it as a child and I still like it to this day. The core reason why is the dialogue, which is at times rude and stupid but still hilarious. My favorite part was The Mother of All Messes. The kids who played Conrad and Sally were great actors; I loved when they said ""That's Mom's dress!"" and Mike Myers did a great job as the Cat, too. Though I don't think the movie's something Seuss would be proud of and that it should be PG-13, I thought it was really funny, so I recommend it.",2014

1,"Don't get me wrong, I assumed this movie would be stupid, I honestly did, I gave it an incredibly low standard to meet. The only reason I even saw it was because there were a bunch of girls going (different story for a different time). As I began watching I noticed something, this film was terrible. Now there are two types of terrible, there's Freddy vs. Jason terrible, where you and your friends sit back and laugh and joke about how terrible it is, and then there is a movie like this. The Cat in The Hat failed to create even a momentary interest in me. As I watched the first bit of it not only was I bored senseless, but I felt as though I had in some way been violated by the horrendousness of said movie. Mike Myers is usually brilliant, I love the majority of his work, but something in this movie didn't click. One of the things that the director/producers/writers/whatevers changed was that they refused to use any of the colors of the original book (red, black, white) on any character but the Cat. Coincidentally or not, they also refused to capture any of the original (and i hate to use this word, but it fits) zaniness of the original. The book was like an Ice Cream Sunday, colorful and delicious, and the movie was about as bland and hard to swallow as sawdust.",2005

1,Bad. Bad. Bad. Those three lines sum up this crappy little film that can only attract idiot children and their parents to the cinema. and its... #1 Movie in America! What is this country thinking? Mike Myers looking more like Micheal Jackson. Some Chineese lady that falls asleep within 3 minutes. A lame plot with dirty jokes. It's grotesuque and awful. When Green-Eggs and Ham comes out in 2005 I'll be so happy! (not) Eddie Murphy and Tracy Morgan will probably play two hipsters trying to find the lost Green-Eggs and Ham. They'll try to chase Sam-I-Am and that mean guy who are running away with it. (I hope they don't ruin the classic book.) Don't waste time and money by seeing this.,2004
1,"Mean spirited, and down right degrading adaptation to the classic children's tale not only lacks the charm of its forefather but lacks any talent what so ever. Mike Myers should not only be ashamed of himself for his horrible performance that is a clear rip off of what Jim Carrey did but he should give up acting all together. He is so annoying that you would want to beat the crap out of him if you were able to jump right in the film. The sets are ugly and the cinematography is very poor. I have seen a lot of bad film this year, but this not only takes the cake but it is with out a doubt one the worst films ever made.",2003

If I ever saw this film on a shelf, I would buy it if it was under £3. I would even choose it over Avatar, the hunger games and game of thrones, but not The Walking Dead, that is amazing.

1,"Well the previews looked funny and I usually don't go to movies on opening night especially with my kids because ......well you never know.  Here is a movie that doesn't appeal either to children or adults as the jokes are too perverse for children and falls completely flat for entertainment purposes for adults.  I was actually embarrassed to be with my 9 and 6 year old and having to explain to my 6 year old what S H * T spells.  Essentially what happens here is a total twisting of Dr. Seuss's classic.  It adds an evil and lazy neighbor who wants to marry the children's mother for her money. If that was a subplot, then maybe that would have been fine but it ends up being the major plot around the whole movie and ""the cat"" plays more of a subplot role in exposing the neighbor to the mom for who he really is.  Take my advice and read the book and pass on the movie.",2004

In one part cat is talking to a gardening tool (hoe) cat talks to it like it is his hoe (agin adult humor). the naming of his car I all so though was a little untastful for a kids movie. under the rating you'll find: mild cude humor and some double-entendres.

It begins with a spoof of the first scene from The Ring, then cuts to Tom's (Charlie Sheen) discovery of the crop circles on his farm ala Signs. As a bridge between the stories, Cindy Campbell (Anna Farris) is a television news reporter who is doing a story on the crop circles, and who is the guardian of a young psychic boy, Cody (Drew Mikuska), similar to Aidan of The Ring. The two stories turn out to be intimately connected. Tom's brother, George (Simon Rex) is a white rapper, ala Eminem in 8 Mile, and he strikes up a romance with Campbell. Meanwhile, President Harris (Leslie Nielsen) also becomes involved as the security of the country is threatened.",2005
7,"Parody movies are always of the type 'love or hate' it. I am not intellectual, I love cinema as culture, but also as entertainment, so I like them. Further, when I see this type of movie, I know exactly what I am going to see: scatological jokes, funny and surrealistic situations and definitely a movie that will never be indicated for an Oscar. I found this 'Scary Movie 3' very funny. It satirizes mainly 'The Ring', followed by 'Signs', and part of '8 Miles' and one of these last two 'The Matrix' sequences. The last scene is a joke with 'Final Destination'. This is the type of movie that you must shut down your brain and start laughing. There are two scenes that I liked very much: when the moron George (Simon Rex) is in a club for Afro-Americans, wins the rap competition and covers his head with the hood of his coat. The other one, when Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris) uses her laptop and many screens pops-up. In many sites, even in IMDb, there are some pops-up screens that irritate me. What I do not understand is some comments of persons that should never watch this type of movie. What do they expect to see when they go to the movie theaters or buy / rent a DVD of 'Scary Movie 3', directed by David Zucker and with Leslie Nielsen in the cast? An art movie, with hidden messages, an epic, a classic or a film with politically correct jokes? Honestly, if I did not like this genre, I would never spend my time watching it. My vote is seven.",2004

I liked the first movie, but didn't find the second one worth another watch, because they had lost all originality or sense of good humor. All they did was badly repeating what had worked in the first movie and that is something that should be avoided at all time. Now with David Zucker as the director, the man who also gave us some other excellent parodies like ""Airplane!"" and ""The Naked Gun"", instead of Keenen Ivory Wayans, I had some good hopes again. And he certainly didn't disappoint me...",2005

Although he took over a series from the Wayans Brothers, Zucker turned it around into something almost completely new. It isn't quite in the same vein as his one true classic, Airplane!, but it shows how he should stay away from movies like My Boss's Daughter and go back into the spoof genre which got him, and his team, off the ground.",2003
10,First Aiplane and Naked Gun - now this! ,2005
7,"I thought this one was rather funny, I liked it a tiny bit more than the first one (didn't see the 2nd), but that is probably because I saw all the movies they made fun of with the exception of ""8 Mile"".  The problem is once again this movie isn't going to be very good if you haven't seen ""The Ring"" or ""Signs"" the two main ones they made fun of therefore it is not really a stand alone movie.  You can miss ""8 Mile"" though as anything you saw in the previews of that one would be all you need.  These ""Scary Movies"" and the last few parodies made really require you to see movies before you can enjoy.  That just was not the case with movies like ""Airplane"" and ""The Naked Gun"", sure there were a few references that might of helped too  if you saw the movie, but not a whole lot as it was stand alone funny.  This movie mainly makes fun of ""The Ring"", there are some funny jokes here, but for my money the funniest stuff came at the expense of ""Signs"".  The Ring probably made up 50 percent or more of the jokes with Signs at around 30 percent and ""The Matrix Reloaded"" and ""8 Mile"" making the remainder.  There is one small joke that is Lord of the Rings related, but it isn't anything really funny.  There was supposed to be something in it making fun of the Hulk, but I am pretty sure it was cut because I didn't notice anything. Which leads to another complaint, why the heck did they make the movie so short?  This movie had to be an hour and twenty minutes max, you're telling me they couldn't find anything else to spoof?  I really hate going to a movie that is under an hour and thirty minutes.  Overall though it was an okay movie with some good laughs here and there.",2004
7,"I think this movie is okay, not the best I've ever seen, but definitely not the worst. The storyline is a bit confusing; however, because it is absolutely hilarious, it's catchy and easy to watch. When there's a serious bit, something funny always happens - okay you kind of know what's going to happen next, but you'll be surprised at certain parts how the story suddenly twists. For example: The Michael Jackson Part, where he pretends to be the daughter but gets found out and starts a fight, screaming his famous ""Oww!"". Then he falls out the window, the guy trys to grab him, but ends up pulling off his nose! ",2005
4,"Scary Movie 3 isn't as funny as its predecessors but its still has its funny moments. It all begins when roving reporter Cindy Campbell sets out to find a hard news story in the middle of television sweeps. She soon uncovers an outrageous onslaught of globe-threatening developments including alien invaders, killer videotapes, freaky crop circles and much more. Faced with conspiracies of massive proportions, and a crew of very strange people following her around, Cindy must fight to stop evil from taking over the world yet again. The plot is a non-issue here as the first two were pretty much plot less. This time around they focus on Signs, The Ring, Matrix Reloaded and 8 mile as well as many others just not as much as the previously mentioned ones. The first one was {imo} one of the funniest films I have ever seen. The second one wasn't as good but still quite funny. The third one is mildly enjoyable but its nothing special. Let's just say that I didn't mind seeing it once but I probably wouldn't want to see it again. The jokes are either hit or miss and the ones that are funny usually involve Charlie Sheen. The lame ones usually involve Anthony Anderson as he is very overrated. Why he keeps getting cast is unclear because he isn't funny. Anna Faris gives a funny performance and she's also kind of underrated. Simon Rex shows some potential as he actually wasn't so bad. Regina Hall also returns as Brenda and she gives a pretty funny performance. The rest of the cast were pretty much a bunch of cameos. Jenny McCarthy and Pamela Anderson probably had the funniest scene out of all the cameos. Their in the opening sequence spoofing The Ring and that scene turns out to be on of the more enjoyable ones in the film. Denise Richards, Queen Latifah, Camryn Manheim and many others also have cameos. David Zucker directs and while this isn't another Airplane, it's also not another My Boss's Daughter either. Its pointless to really analyze a straight comedy as the main thing that people want to know if its funny or not. Like I said before if you do like it, you probably won't really like it that much. In the end, I found it a bit disappointing as the PG-13 rating kind of weaken it but it can still be enjoyed. Rating 6.3/10",2005

Jokes, pratfalls and sight gags are supposed to be naturally funny. Hitting the viewer over the head with tired jokes is not cool. The humor in this film was caters to juvenile imbeciles who'll laugh at anything. When they catered to the junior high school crowd, any sense of self respect was tossed out the window.

1,"I saw this movie with two of my friends and none of us liked it. Even for people who like stupid humor, this movie is completely inane.  I know because my friends like some idiotic movies.  I may have laughed a total of 3 times and that was only due to timing. The jokes could only be found funny by someone with the maturity of a 14 year old or younger.  Simon Rex's jokes especially fell flat. When George Carlin appeared, I began to have hope.  Sadly, he never rose to my expectations.  Come on George, you're better than that.  The biggest casting error was Ja Rule as a secret service agent.  He seemed vacant and lost, as if he couldn't remember his lines or he didn't know how he even got on the movie set.  I would try to mention a standout performance, but there were none.  My friends and I were constantly checking our watches and hoping the movie would end.  The fact that anyone liked this crap scares me.  It represents the overall degradation of the intelligence of the general population.  I'll bet anyone that liked SM3 doesn't understand a word I just said.",2003
2,"The third film in a trilogy is often considered to be the worst, so considering how lousy the first two Scary Movies were, I wasn't getting my hopes up too high for Scary Movie 3. Sure enough, part three proved to be a thoroughly woeful effort, completely devoid of laughs despite being directed by one of the 'big names' in the spoof genre, David Zucker.",2011
7,"I've seen all the films out of the Scary Movie film franchise and I can say without the slightest doubt this is the 2nd best Movie Movie behind Superhero Movie. The jokes in this are hysterical and it's funnier now because I've seen The Ring and I also like The Matrix movies. This isn't the funniest Scary Movie, 4 is the funniest although this is better... I just seem to like it more.",2010

3,"Here are several reasons for the low scoring reviews, for those of you who thought it was terrific. Watch again and tell me that any one of these is incorrect (NOTE. I'd warn about possible spoilers, but if you're actually thinking about what you're watching, you'll see the following plot elements coming).",2012
8,"Hey, out there. You guys who slammed this in your reviews, did you see the same film I did? Not real? Improbable? Impossible? Huh. If those of you who found this thought-provoking film about two men on the edge of the social plane, one who is over the edge and the other given the task of hunting the first one down-- both men, socially disaffected and on their own, unbelievable and impossible, give some attention to Alston Chase's article in the June, 200, pp.41-65 of the Atlantic Monthly on Theodore Kaczynski, the Unabomber and the effects of his experiences being part of the ill-conceived and unethical study on human subjects during his undergraduate years there. The formula is simple: Take a bright, talented person who is teetering on the edge of emotional stability, fill them with lots of head stuff about social and environmental corruption, train in the technology of killing people and then, turn them loose. While no one wanted to turn Kaczynski into the unabomber, the circumstances, however well-intended, did. The film story of Aaron Hallum played by the competent Benicio Del Toro and his counterpart, L.T. Bonham, played by Tommy Lee Jones, bring this theme into clear focus. OK, if you are a shoot'em up thriller fan (as I self-confessedly admit to being), you might have missed the car chase, the sex and all that, but gang, it is a gripping and thought-provoking story. Not real? I submit, read the data on Columbine, The Minn Indian Res and the Unabomber and guess again. It's real. Damn real.",2005
3,"When you see a movie with Benicio Del Toro and Tommy Lee Jones on the front, you expect a half decent movie. To be honest, I'm shocked Benicio agreed to such a half assed project.",2004
7,"How could they have made this story better. There wasn't a need for more dialog or love story and the fight scenes were amazingly well done. Tommy Lee Jones and Benicio Del Toro played expertly off one another. I didn't flash onto another film when I was watching this. I was surprised to read a comparison to Rambo. What? How is that even possible. Other than the military theme (which is rather minimal in this film, since Aaron could have easily been CIA, etc.) and people being killed, what is the connection? ",2005
10,"Aaron Hallam (Benicio Del Toro) is a special ops guy in the military who has been trained by one of the best--L.T. Bonham (Tommy Lee Jones). Hallam is routinely ordered to execute strategic figures, and he probably doesn't often know why. Sometimes he has to do his work in the midst of chaos, and sometimes he has to take out people who get in the way. After a brief prologue establishing Hallam's character in the middle of the Bosnian conflict, The Hunted has him back in the States, trying to reintegrate with society. When Hallam can't do it, L.T. is sent for to track him down.",2005
7,"I too don't understand the negative comments here. The Hunted is a great action flick. It features great leads from Tommy Lee Jones (as you would expect) and Benicio Del Toro (my first film experience with him, I thought he added an amazing presence to his character) plus good support from the surrounding cast. The film has some amazing locations and scenery and was very well paced. The fight and actions scenes were excellent with some decent gore thrown in where necessary. My only nit pick was I felt it could have been a little longer in duration. Ignore the bad press on The Hunted. I just don't understand how you can't enjoy this film - that simple! Oh,..and doesn't Tommy Lee Jones really suit the beard.",2009
3,"For those who don't get the negative comments, I am equally confused by the positive ones, believe me.",2006
9,"Three facts about this film help to make it highly-rated in my book: it's very entertaining, moves fast and lasts only 90 minutes. So, if in the mood for a combination Fugitive/Rambo story with two very intense lead actors, this is a convenient diversion to play numerous times.",2006
8,"Although it would be easy to write The Hunted off as a simple chase film (I can see the pitch now: ""It's First Blood married to Predator with a dose of The Fugitive"", and in reality that is a pretty fair description) but it's straight forward manner lends a constant sense of urgency. Throughout this gory (yeah it's pretty graphic) cat and mouse thriller we are also given some real insight into Del Toro's character. Unwilling to make sweeping judgments about nearly any of the characters (Connie Nielsen's FBI agent is a bit stubborn and single minded and occasionally very careless in discharging her firearm in public, Tommy Lee Jones'survivalist trainer has a guilty conscious of his own and even Del Toro's transformation is understandable), the finale is exciting but emotionally complicated, even tragic. The camera work and editing are very effective and affective while not overwhelming the finished product with the typical Hollywood style over substance dilemma. Combined with some very strong performances by the leads THE HUNTED makes for a very intense and satisfying thriller experience.",2005

1,This movie must of been written by 12 year boys for 12 year old boys. That's the only audience that could possibly believe this crock. One ridiculous scene after another. The wolf scene in the beginning of the movie was ignorant at best. This is the kind of irresponsible filmmaking that gets people in trouble in nature. The knife making scenes were unbelievable. Huge plot holes in the story and very predictable. Poor continuity during many of the scenes throughout the film. I just had to go out of my way to post a review on this movie so people won't waste their money. I can't believe Tommy Lee Jones stooped so low. What a Ho!,2014
6,"My posting a review of The Hunted is in direct contradiction of my beliefs about this film, but so is anyone reading it, so it's a moot point.",2004

Actually it is a movie I have already seen, only then it was called 'First Blood' starring Sylvester Stallone as Rambo. Not that both movies are exactly the same, even the atmosphere is very different, but the basics are the same.",2004
5,"If you've seen both First Blood and The Fugitive, you've already watched The Hunted.  Aaron Hallam (Del Toro), who was awarded the Silver Star for his bravery shown while fighting in Kosovo, only 4 years earlier, is now on the outs with the military, isn't really trusting anybody, and was listed as Missing In Action and made a target by the Government that he used to work for.  Now, poor Hallam, fearing both for his safety and sanity is out in the Portland woods, killing what appear to be deer hunters.  Only, these deer hunters have military telescopes attached to their rifles - not exactly a necessity when it comes to snagging yourself a buck.",2003
1,"William Friedkin didn't make that many great movies after all. The Exorcist, The French Connection. I haven't seen his 60s movies but Sorcerer was just the bold but vain remake of a masterpiece.",2010
4,"On the surface this seems a rather derivative film . Part RAMBO , part THE FUGITIVE but you're left with the feeling that THE HUNTED wants to go its own way . Unfortunately these bits seem to have ended up on an editing floor somewhere since the movie has a disjointed feel with important aspects like character motivation and empathy for the anti-hero missing . Actually these parts probably didn't make it past the final draft of the screenplay .In FIRST BLOOD you can the tough hand Rambo has been dealt . He turns up at the start looking for his old buddy from 'Nam only to find that he's died from cancer , possibly caused by agent orange . This leads to an inciting incident where an over zealous cop arrests him for vagrancy . Here everything is taken on face value . Aaron Hallum kills a couple of hunters because he thinks they're "" sweepers "" CIA spooks who want him out of the way because he knows too much . I guess this subplot is left ambiguous , after all you can't go around disemboweling hunters and hope the audience can have empathy for you , but all this is totally confusing and inserting scenes where Hallum is kind to a little girl is not groundbreaking . It's quite the reverse it's cliché ",2010
1,"As a former career soldier I was disgusted by the negative, B.S> stereotypes that this film fosters. From Jones lecture about the difficulty of ""turning off the ability to kill"" to the stereotype of the lonely, crazy, hermit of a combat vet to the ridiculously unrealistic combat scenes in the former Yugoslavia, this movie was pathetic in every way... remember the flashback scene where Del Toro remembers seeing a massacre where three idiots STAND IN A CIRCLE and then cut loose on full auto with their assault rifles? Hmmm... funny how the guy standing across from each of them never shot the goofball on the other side when it was on a stone floor! From beginning to end the script was FAR below the considerable abilities of both of the stars and I am pretty surprised that either of them took this feeble foppery on. As someone with familiarization with combat knife skills I know that a certain edged weapon expert was consulted for the film and this was its only saving grace. The bottom line is that a joke of a movie like this was far more in keeping with the tradition of Golan-Globus with Chuck Norris than legitimate attempts to show for one thing, the very real suffering that some combat vets go through when they leave the military, but NO, we do NOT run around like lunatics cutting people apart, shoot people from church towers, and especially Special Operations troopers are specially screened in depth for any proclivity at all towards psychological instability. Save your money and 2 hours of time that could otherwise be spent say, breathing or laughing at rap music than watching this stinker. The producers also owe an apology to combat vets everywhere.",2005
10,"What a great movie The Hunted is! Tommy Lee Jones and Benicio Del Toro were excellent especially in their scenes together! Connie Nielson was good. I was so amazed by the fighting that they did! There is a lot of blood and slashing! People think it is like the Fugitive and First Blood but I really don't think so. Sure Its in the wilderness and Tommy Lee Jones said some things like Richard Crenna did in First Blood and his character trained Del Toro's character and Del Toro was being chased a lot but to Me it is a lot more than that! The scenes are spectacular! I don't think this movie deserves all of the bad comments it has gotten and I like Tommy Lee Jones' chase movies and I wouldn't mind to see him in another one! If you haven't see The Hunted and you like The above mentioned cast and action and chase films such as First Blood, The Fugitive, U.S. Marshals, and Double Jeopardy then this movie is perfect for you!",2003
1,"This b-movie must be in my top-5 of bad movies. Bad acting. Bad story. How can Tommy L. J. put his good name to such a crap-movie? No humor at all. Rambo is classic. This film will hopefully soon be forgotten. A waste of time. Pathetic to watch the two main characters produce their weapons for the final fight. How bad can it get?? Could it be that T.L.J. has a contract to fulfill, with making a certain amount of movies? And then spending 1-2 days to shoot this? This review has to be at least 10 lines, but I have nothing more to say - yet I have to get this horrible experience out of my system, so please apologize for these last lines - but believe me, the film is more boring and uninteresting than these lines.",2006

7,"Charming Christmas confection--about a boy raised by elves in the North Pole who grows up and journeys to N.Y.C. in search of his biological father--puts a clever spin on even the most familiar gags, successfully walking a fine line between absurdist comedy and holiday schmaltz. Will Ferrell looks like a string-bean in yellow tights and, with his mass of curly hair peeking out from underneath his elf's hat, he could easily be used as a walking punchline. Fortunately, director Jon Favreau's handling of ""Elf"" is incredibly nimble, treating Ferrell and his naive character Buddy with the utmost respect; you can laugh at all the silly pranks without ever feeling guilty. Favreau's work is smooth, and he's assembled an incredible supporting cast of character actors to back his star, though some may find the climactic moments (involving Edward Asner as Santa Claus) a bit too literal--and the movie is certainly funnier before we get to this point. Still, the special effects are kept to a minimum in order to let the people shine...and that's not only refreshing, it's heart-warming. *** from ****",2007
10,"This was one of my favorite movies in 2003. Will Ferrell is brilliant as the Elf. The supporting cast is great too, especially Bob Newhart as his elf ""dad"". The characters are well written and it is a refreshing film to get lost in. Will Ferrell plays the elf with such innocence, he is so funny! This is not just a Christmas film but when the DVD comes out I will be watching ""Elf"" in July. The story progresses nicely, there are many lessons to be learned as you watch this movie. It touched my heart in many ways. I highly recommend this movie for kids AND adults, you won't regret it. Treat yourself and watch this ""original"" movie. Hollywood needs to make more like this.",2004

10,This was my 4th viewing and now ready to review.,2016
6,"This is a good natured holiday comedy that definitely is in the same realm as ""The Santa Clause"" and (Dare I say?) ""Miracle on 34th Street"". Story is about a human that has been raised by Santa's elves at the North Pole and as he gets older he figures out that he's very different from the other elves. Years earlier Santa (Ed Asner) was delivering at an orphanage and a human baby accidentally crawled into his sack and was taken back to the North Pole where he was raised by Papa Elf (Bob Newhart). He is called Buddy (Will Ferrell) and he grows to six foot three and one day he is told the truth about his situation and told by Santa who his real father is. Buddy travels to New York City to meet his father and he heads to the Empire State Building where he works. He finds his father Walter (James Caan) who runs a publishing business and works all the time much to the chagrin of his family. Walter is unable to get away from Buddy and after a blood test proves he is his son he takes him home with him to stay with his family. He meets Walter's wife Emily (Mary Steenburgen) and their son and Walter thinks Buddy is just someone reverting to his childhood after a shock. Buddy starts to work in a department store and he meets a woman named Jovie (Zooey Deschanel) and is smitten by her. Buddy tries to fit in with the others but finds it difficult although he becomes friends with Walter's son and starts dating Jovie.",2003
10,"It was so nice to be able to sit down and watch a movie featuring an SNL actor without having to mute or fast forward any crude parts. Granted, this may not be Will Farrell's most amazing performance, but if you want a new Christmas movie to watch this season, I highly recommend Elf. I talked to a few people who thought the movie was stupid, but that was because they were expecting Will Farrell's character to be a duplicate of his SNL performances. So, to fully enjoy this movie, watch it without any expectations and remember that it's okay to have a childlike sense of humor--nobody's too cool for a great Christmas movie. I love most all the movies from Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider, Will Farrell, Jim Carrey, Chris Farley, Chevy Chase, and David Spade, but most of them aren't appropriate for viewers of all ages. Elf is a movie you can throw in the VCR and not have to worry about what the kids hear or see on it. Thanks, Will, for putting out a hilarious movie that the whole family can watch!",2004
9,"The most helpful thing I can tell you about this movie is that if you've got even a smidgen of a youthful spirit about you, then this movie will make you laugh until you cry....over and over. There's one scene where Elf and a gruffy fellow warehouse worker(who was a total stranger just a few moments before) are sitting on a pallet after smoking some dope, and are laughing really hard about something really stupid, and the Elf leans over and begins tickling the guy under the arms and shouting ""Tickle, Tickle!"" as they both topple over in hysteric ecstasy....and I thought I was going to have a coronary, I laughed so long and hard (after running the DVD back to watch the same scene about 5 times over!!!!! This is absolutely my favorite all-time comedy! I'm very hard to please when it comes to comedies, seeing most of them as just stupid, but Elf is in a class by itself.",2006
8,"I do love Christmas movies, always a sucker for them even if the style and story is not new or different. Elf does bring some new story to the typical Christmas movie but for the most part it's same old, same old which for someone who loves the Christmas movie is great!! Unfortunately I am not a fan of Will Ferrell, okay granted I thought Night At The Roxbury was pretty funny but everything else since then has been horrid. Nonetheless with Elf Ferrell finally finds something that suits his completely child like annoying behavior and his over acting actually suits the character.",2005
8,"At first glance, it's hard to imagine a less likely candidate for an unironic Christmas film than the director/star of the snappy, sardonic Swingers (and soon-to-be director of Iron Man, of all things). Yet, curiously enough, it's this particular background that makes Jon Favreau so well-suited (ha) for the job. Sharp enough not to tumble into the schmaltz too heavily but shrewd enough to recognize the value in playing it straight, Favreau's Elf hits the ideal balance between being fun for kids while clever and sweet enough to remain tolerable for adults without caving to becoming closeted-self-loathing. It's no wonder that such a comparatively recent film has already worked its way into vintage holiday movie canon. ",2015
6,"A nice Christmas-themed movie. Nice is very apt for this title, as I experienced it never really either shone or sucked. Just nice. A few scenes that made me laugh audibly, and a lot of scenes that made me smile.",2012
1,"I could not believe this movie at all. So many of the comments are about what a wonderful movie this is, and I watched this with my children in great anticipation, but I kept wondering, would anyone want to watch this more than once? I like sappy Christmas movies; they are fun. I even like fantasies based on a silly premise. To work, however, there must be some semblance of believability.",2005
3,"(This review has spoilers, although I consider it a stretch to call them that due to the nature of this movie.) I was going to leave a comment without reading any others, because I had an idea what I would read, having heard lots of favorable opinions from others regarding this movie. Then I decided I really needed to read what others wrote, and my suspicions were confirmed precisely: Several people saying how great or cute this movie was, and the occasional person telling it essentially how it really was. I'll add to that. Was this movie just silly, which connotes an innocent lack of intelligent matter, or was it stupid, connoting something a bit deeper? Considering that movies (at least, the Hollywood variety) are created to make money, I'll put my money on the latter. Hollywood knows there are a lot of people out there who have nothing better to do with their money than to shell it out at the movie theater to watch something unoriginal, uncreative, and with roles that require no particular acting talent. These people also won't demand that, within whatever flight of fancy a story may take, the story follow rules it sets for itself. For instance, Buddy is required to eat, apparently, since he consumes voluminous portions at the meals we see, yet he travels quite some distance from the North Pole without eating--or sleeping, which is obviously something else he's required to do. He also is stupid/childlike for no reason for which we're ever made aware. He's stupid/childlike because he's grown up as an elf? Why then are not the other elves like that? If he's stupid because he's grown up with elves, why doesn't he start figuring things out once he's with humans?",2004

It seems to grow in popularity year on year and it's hard to believe that it's been 14 years since its release.",2017

7,"I never gave ""Elf"" much consideration, and it's not ""A Christmas Story"" levels of classic, but there's a lot to be said for Will Ferrell in elf booties roaming wide-eyed the streets of New York City. I guess the movie hinges on that central arrested development innocence vs. modern-day yuletide cynicism, but that ain't a bad thing. Favreau squeezes every funny ounce out of putting Ferrell in small spaces and the guy really is an endearing spaz. I like the cast, Peter Dinklage is a great easter egg (for lack of a better phrase) and it's just the right dosage of holiday warmth. Sweet, but not stifling.",2015
9,"Elf (2003): Dir: Jon Favreau / Cast: Will Ferrell, James Caan, Zooey Deschanel, Mary Steenburgen, Bob Newhart: The story of little people doing big things, or in this case big people doing even bigger things. Will Ferrell stars as Buddy who crawled into Santa's sack upon his visit to the orphanage. He is raised at the North Pole where cheer and good will are the norm. When he learns that he is human he treks to New York to reunite with his human family. His father works in publishing and sees Buddy as a lunatic. He eventually lands a job in a toy store where a young lady with a winning singing voice catches his heart. Neat concept and funny situations and a conclusion where Buddy obtains the best of both worlds. Directed by Jon Favreau who previously made a very different film called Swingers. This time he aims for a different audience. He is backed by Ferrell with outrageous bursts of enthusiasm in an overgrown elf costume that is appropriately out of place. James Caan makes a great foil as his father. Zooey Deschanel is pleasant but as a female shop worker she is a predictable romantic prop. The biggest disappointment is Mary Steenburgen who is limited as Caan's wife. Bob Newhart narrates the film as Buddy's parental elf, which adds that fable like affect to its presentation. Hilarious Christmas comedy taking the elf theme to new heights. Score: 9 ½ / 10",2015
5,"So-so film with a few really funny moments. It always seemed like the comedy could have gone two steps further than it did. There are tons of missed opportunities and jokes that are built up without payoff (the news broadcast at the end of the film is a perfect example). Elf earns points for being a decent family film in that it has almost no objectionable content  one very long belch is about it. It's nice that it doesn't resort to gross-out humor, but it could certainly stand to be less lame a lot of the time. Will Ferrell, a former Saturday Night Live actor, stars as a human who is raised by elves until his enormous height compared to the other elves makes this fact all too obvious. When Ferrell finds out that his father (James Caan) lives in New York City, he goes out and finds him. It becomes a standard fish-out-of-water comedy. The writing is half-hearted, so the weight of the movie ends up resting wholly on Ferrell, who does his damndest to carry it on his shoulders. I've always been a fan of Ferrell, even if he did create a couple of truly obnoxious characters on SNL. He actually does a fine job in Elf, playing a truly manic but sweet idiot. The filmmakers should have trusted Ferrell more, because it really shoots itself in the foot when it begins to concentrate on a very cheesy and unbelievable crisis in the elf's newfound human family. Ferrell has run away from home, and Caan and his family think they can find him in New York City  which, of course, they do. And Ferrell (along with his family and his girlfriend) have to convince the people of NYC to have faith in Santa Claus so his sleigh can fly. They do this by having the girlfriend (a very cute Zooey Deschanel, who might look a bit too much like Reese Witherspoon to become a star) sing 'Santa Claus Is Coming to Town' on the news. I was enjoying the film, but this kind of formulaic garbage just ruined it. It's nice to see Bob Newhart, Charles Durning, and Andy Richter. One of my favorite comediennes, Amy Sedaris, was also there somewhere, but I must have missed her (was she one of the elves?). 5/10.",2003
1,"I took my 5 year old son to see this and regretted every minute.  I kept begging him to leave.  Unless you like stupid and predictable humor this movie is not for you.  The only thing we enjoyed about the film was the popcorn.  I think he also enjoyed Santa Claus and the Reindeers.  This film was very lame,  I knew when I saw the commercials that it would be awful but I had several people tell me it was hilarious, next time I will definitely think for myself.",2003

1,"It is incomprehensible that this film garners a 7.1 on here. It's sappy, stupid and obnoxious. Used to be that stars who had a name would be worried about being involved in a film that was totally vapid. That day is long gone. The story is so stupid. The ending is so sentimental and dumb. As the sputtering blunderbus flew off during the climax of this piece of crap, I could only think of the scores of starving people who could have been fed instead of spending millions on this useless pablum. And John Favreau doing this is all the more hilarious. The way he chomps his cigar while waxing unpoetic about the biz on Bravo, you'd actually think he had more in mind than just cashing in on pieces of garbage like this. The whole cast looks like they are attending a wake except for Will Ferrell who turns in another classic post-SNL performance: one dimensional, schticky idiocy that might work in a 2m skit, but leaves you numb after an hour and a half.",2004
10,"""Secondhand Lions"" is a movie which has achieved excellence.  The story line is fast-moving and packed with nuance.  Various elements of the plot overlap and blend for a harmonious whole.

7,This is a very gentle film - not as gripping as Big Fish but in a similar genre - which is worth a second look and therefore a reappraisal.,2004
10,"I cannot see how anyone would dis this movie unless they especially disliked a particular actor. I thought the casting was great, right down to the secondhand lion and the pig. The flashbacks were hilarious because as we age, the things we did before become more dramatic and are further enhanced. No one thinks about their past in terms of mediocrity, and this was brought out in the flashback scenes. Osment was a superb cast in this movie because of his unchanging facial expression. He has been burnt out with lies and his mother's constant searching for a husband only to find another loser.His comment to his mother said it all. Here was a kid who had met a lot of ""uncles"", so here were two more uncles that he was being pawned off on.",2004
10,"A classic. This is one of those male bonding movies one tends to cringe at nowadays, but there's no cringing here. Due to the wonderful script, direction and acting by all the principals, this one unfolds like a rose in bloom. Before you know it the movie has you in its grasp and the characters become 3-dimensional and their battles become yours as well. The plot is simple...a teenager is dumped on his great-uncles by his scheming mother who wants the kid to find where the uncles have hidden their fortune. The uncles, played by Michael Caine, sans British accent, and Robert Duvall, work well together as brothers slow to warm to the boy, played by Haley Joel Osment. Eventually the layers peel away and the boy learns about the earlier thrilling adventures of the uncles and begins to see them as role models. But then, are the stories true? Should the boy return to his mother? Should the uncles fight to keep him around? The ending had me in tears. Tears of happiness. A perfect film for the entire family.",2005

It's a great statement about living your life to the fullest and believing in the things that really matter like love and honor. The actors were fabulous. I think young Haley Joel Osment has a lot to offer films and I hope we see much more of him in the future. Michael Caine never disappoints me and I love his Texas accent in the film. Overall, this is truly one movie fit for all ages. A true heartwarming film with a great message for anyone who will hear it.",2004

10,"I am very critical about movies, especially the ones which will pass before the eyes of my 9 & 7-yr old daughters, so I was extremely surprised and impressed with Secondhand Lions. I was washed away by the depth of this movie and challenged by what it presented. Tucked into the mystery of the uncles' past (unraveling in the moonlight) is a revelation of a life well-lived. What drives man to a life of adventure and where does he go when his body can't keep up? What, when, where determines how he passes the wisdom of the ages? Created in the image of God, we are challenged to be fully alive while we have the strength. ""Sometimes the things that may or may not be true are the things that man needs to believe in the most"" and I won't spoil the movie for you by giving you the carrot. I will tell you that there is a sincere love for life in this story that is utterly compelling.

9,"For a VERY long time I've been disgusted with most of the stuff coming out of Hollywood...  too many movies with huge budgets and absolutely NO imagination or talent involved. Lately tho, the Hollywood system has slipped a bit, and a few films by SMART people working with nonformula scripts have been falling through the cracks. And they're a refreshing breeze for those of us that don't bother with ""One Weekend Wonders"" that generate monster box office receipts for two or three weeks, that involve the latest orgasm generator ""stars"" and a ton of explosives and guns...   just to sink into oblivion afterwards, like TITANIC or PEARL HARBOR.",2004
10,"Is there anything not good about this movie..? Great casting, great story line, excellent cinematography, absolute very very funny and at the same time a good tearjerker with a surprisingly mix of funny and sad twist at the end. The movie was (in the Netherlands)listed as the best movie for all the family since 'finding little Nemo'... well let me correct that... 'finding little Nemo' only could wish to stand so close in the shadow of this excellent coming of age-movie. 'Second hand lions' is funnier, tickles the imagination and tells some wise life-lessons. Just see the movie and let the magic of truly good storytelling take hold of you.",2004
8,"Secondhand Lions has lasting entertainment appeal. It's a good movie the entire family can repeatedly enjoy watching. Michael Caine, Robert Duvall and Haley Joel Osmint are a magnetic acting trio, carrying the simple coming of age story, about an insecure young man, to heroic heights. Delightfully acted, the movie's appeal is enhanced by the wonderful cast of animals, especially the loving ""secondhand lion"". This charming story deserves 8 stars because it provides delightful entertainment in a timeless story about love, male bonding and the importance of role modeling. Unlike the characters played by Caine and Duvall, who fight against their inevitable aging, this movie will live beyond the careers of all the three leads.",2012
9,"The first thing I noticed in this film was the farmhouse, a caliche road, and the mailbox--and I knew it was rural Texas. Then I noticed a couple of uncles sitting on their front porch with shotguns, and a young teenage boy not knowing exactly what to think. I was hooked immediately when flipping through the TV channels and seeing Secondhand Lions.",2012
10,"I knew absolutely nothing about this movie when we got it from a video store... what a pleasant surprise! This has to rank as my movie of the year for 2004. The storyline is great and sustained, the acting superb - interesting to watch Osment grow up, from Forrest Gump (I think that's where I first saw him) to this. Caine and Duval are brilliant as ever. I honestly cannot find fault with this movie. The only reason I would not recommend it is if you're looking to watch something with serious action or serious romance in it... but other than that, just watch it. The humor is sharp, dry and off-center, and the movie doesn't have that tacky ""Hollywood"" feeling that so many of them gives nowadays.",2005
10,"No doubt you're reading this review because someone suggested you see this movie. Yes, it has a dumb name, and it has a kid in it, so you don't want to waste your time. Stop delaying, and get past it. Watch the movie. I promise you won't regret it. I swear, every time I recommend this movie, people respond with ""what was the name again?"" and then they look at me like I just said that I like anchovies on my pizza. On a serious note, this movie has word like damn in it, so you might not want your sub-10-year old to watch it. Adults? ABSOLUTELY. And I defy you not to get misty-eyed. Not that it's a sad movie. It's not. It's a movie that will leave you feeling good, and you'll try not to, but you'll end up recommending it. I lent the Netflix to my parents (after giving me the anchovy look), and afterward, they lent it to their neighbors (who I'm sure gave them the anchovy look). Watch the movie. Trust me.",2005
10,"This is just such a great movie...I have seen it three times and am ready to view it again. The times of the movie is reminiscent to me as it is in my time, too; where children were left behind, in orphanages, extended families, etc. etc. How kind these two uncles were...(I know, it was just a story), but quite believable. It shows that if more of us tended to the young people in our lives (not money but time and care) as they did, we would have a much better world.",2005
10,"Rarely I find a movie that after watching....I feel compelled to purchase it. Well, this was one of those charming, endearing and all around wonderful family shows. I was very comfortable watching this with my nine year old twins...and they loved it also. We even stayed on to watch all the edited film and commentaries. It is nice when a movie teaches sensitivity and kindness...rather than endless violence and selfish behaviors that most movies dole out. Walter reminded me of that honesty seen in little Timmy of Timmy and Lassie. I hope you will enjoy this as much as I did...it was a breath of fresh air to see a movie that everyone involved..from the writer to the actors...put in such sincerity and love.",2005
9,"My husband and I were introduced to Second Hand Lions by my cousins! We enjoyed it so much that we purchased a copy for ourselves. It's a story about a young boy who is being raised by a mother that goes from man to man looking for happiness. Unfortunately for her son Walter, she always seems to pick the wrong men. She takes Walter to the home of two of his rich and eccentric uncles that he has never met before with instructions to find out where their money is. She leaves him there while she goes on another one of her man hunting expeditions. A great movie for all ages! We went on a bus trip to South Dakota a couple of weeks ago and this movie was shown. We told the people around us that it was a good movie and it WAS enjoyed by everyone on the bus.",2012
10,"This is my absolute favorite movie made in the last several years. I have enjoyed watching it over and over with my family, which includes 4 teenagers, and they love it as much as I do. Fabulous does not begin to describe Mr. Duvall's performance in this movie. His tough character wears his heart upon his sleeve and his movements and body actions just kept me hearing words of wisdom from my father. I have watched some other performances of his and he so reminds me of my father I get teary eyed and have to give him a call back home in Indiana. The entire cast/writers/directors deserve the highest praise! It is time for more movies on this level where families can sit with their children and watch a movie of good character, moral fiber and plot line! I'm sick of all the horrible language, nude scenes and blood and guts that are in all of the other movies out there today.",2006

10,"With the passing of time and viewing of thousands of movies, I have found the new and unique stories and themes to be few and far between. Certainly, there is nothing new here.  The themes have been explored countless times in stories, plays, books and movies.  Parts of the movie have been recycled from other well done movies of the past.  Secondhand, but oh the craftsmanship.  Michael Caine and Robert Duvall are wonderful in this heartwarming, family film that entertains throughout.  The story is as old as the hills, but the script, acting and direction are so masterful that the old story seems new again.  Normally, there is something about Haley Joel Osment that just plain annoys me and although a little of that crops up here or there, I still enjoyed myself throughout the film.  This movie amuses, entertains, tugs the old heart strings in a few, but not too many spots, and throws in just a small helping of wisdom and insight.  Enough whimsy to amuse and prevent the movie from taking itself too seriously, but not to the point of getting silly.  From director Tim McCanlies to those of you who love movies, here is a heaping helping of what movies are all about.",2004
9,"I like fairy tales, and this movie certainly is one. I wish I had those granduncles! The kid did the right thing. It's not often that movies like this is made nowadays. It really hit me. I liked this movie from the beginning. Even though it's pretty predictable, they still have a few surprises. I also think that this movie will teach someone a lesson of behaviour towards the elderly. You never know who you are dealing with... This movie shows human relations very well. The actors effectively shows this too. Not all actors are able to do that. Well, I will recommend this movie to all audiences. And finally a request for movie makers; please make more movies like this!",2005
10,"Even though I watch a whole lot of movies, almost everything that has a rating of 6.8 or above, surprisingly, this is my first and only review in IMDb, written to appreciate a gem of a film which deserves to be watched by everyone. The comedy in this movie is a class apart. And apart from laughing like crazy, you will also learn a thing or two about living life king size and taking it easy. Its like; at the beginning you have no clue what the movie is gonna be about, and then as the movie progresses, the characters and storyline absorbs you in a tale of classic adventure of two country wise guys teaching a kid the fun of living life with heart, passion and to the fullest. The performances are believable! The tale is extraordinary! This movie can definitely be watched with family, friends or with your girl on a happy date. Cheers!",2013

6,"With the help of Paul Walker and Vin Diesel's chemistry and some intense racing scenes, Rob Cohen's The Fast and the Furious (2001) was an instant hit among racing fans. And like most franchises with critical financial success, a sequel started to be put into the works. Similar to many other sequels, it was distributed two years later and it's difficult to say whether it pleased fans as much as the first one did. According to this site, this is lowest score the franchise has. It wasn't bad at all but it was missing a few elements of the first movie, which left a more entertaining feeling.",2014
7,"The cars, the stunts and the eye candy (Eva Mendes) are better than the first. But unlike the first, 2 Fast 2 Furious still boasts a lacklustre plot. Nevertheless, it's a great ""bro"" movie for the guys. The partnership between Roman Pierce (Tyrese Gibson) and Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) is amusing and works well as they team up and do next to impossible driving stunts with each other. The slight romance between Monica Fuentes (Eva Mendes) and Brian O'Connor is predictable, but it's not to the same extent as the first one - just a bit of flirtation but not to the extent of a full fledged relationship. The Miami backdrop adds to the ""upgrade"" feel of the second movie in the Fast & Furious franchise. Flashy and full of action is 2 Fast, 2 Furious.",2015
7,"I don't think this movie deserves to be called a sequel to ""The Fast and the Furious"",not because it is a bad movie,it is great and it does not fail to entertain most of the public,but for those who really liked the first one,this one is not a sequel.The first was very original,its conflicts were original,the movie was really about cars,and driving,and street racing,this one,in the other hand,presents us conflicts that we have seen for the last decades,the police couple that don't like each other,and at the end of the movie they finish kissing and hugging each other,the guy that falls in love with a woman that could make him fail his mission,the guy that has a drug empire in Miami,and pretends to become more powerful,the police that's trying to stop him,this are most of the conflicts we see in this movie,and we have seen in other movies,so it's not original.The Fast and the Furious was very original with great conflicts,it wasn't as fun as ""its sequel"",but it was awesome as well.But I think that this is the reason why this movie was released in the summer,to make critics say ""well,is not original it has some cars stunts that are hard to believe,but is a summer movie,what the hell"".I also did not like the decision of the director of making the movie in Miami because usually the backgrounds of street racing are nocturnes,Miami is usually more popular on daylight,street racing is usually on high ways in big cities like New York or Los Angeles,but it is clear that the director was just trying to make the movie more attractive to the summer-movie lovers because a lot of people identifies Miami with summer.This movie is more like a cop movie than a street racing movie,you can notice how hard is for the writers to make a space for races,and how easy is for the writers to find space for those things that usually a cop has to deal with.Is not a bad movie,but it is not original,and it cant be called a sequel.",2005
10,"This one was way better than the first, I don't care what all you other pladough brains say. It had better cars, women, plot, bad guys, and action. You should still watch the first one before you see this, even if it wasn't as good, if you want to get some of the stuff they talk about in this film. As far as the plot goes, it's a lot more interesting than a boring theft of electronic equipment. You're much more rather to watch a movie where the good guys are up against meaner and more dangerous bad guys who really have the thrill of danger in them. Actually only Verone did a good job showing that off, but the rest didn't do bad. Action sequences are what really smoke the original. Finally, a circuit race, and more amounts of races instead of cheesy talking for almost a whole act. I'm glad they improved on the races and action, otherwise I would have hated this movie. God Bless you, John Singleton.",2003
8,"This film brings back more of what we loved from the first film with all the cars, girls, and action and multiplies it. However it is still inferior to the first film but that dosen't mean it isn't awesome. This movie has gotten a lot of criticism and i don't understand why there is so much hate for this movie. Some people complained about the lack of plot and the casts acting skills but I don't care about that. I watch these Fast films to be entertained and I was throughly entertained with this one. Even though it dosen't match up to the original it still excels in excitement. I mean how could you go wrong with taking the series to Miami were our eyes will be blessed with dozens of beautiful beach girls. And the races in this movie are also very exciting to. And let's not forget the awesome chase sequence in the film as well. Paul Walker and Tyrese Gibson make a great team and show us why this movie is so cool. I still love this movie despite the many negative reviews I've seen and to all the haters I say forget about the plot and just enjoy the perks. This movie is made for entertainment not Oscar awards and as far as entertainment goes It was grade A popcorn style.",2013

It wasn't before long that the cops found his car and now he has to travels by foot. Until a lady drops him off at a car lot and his money he purchases a blue car and paints it silver. O'Connor ventures off to Miami where he reunites with ex-con Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson) as they join forces with the FBI to track down a shady dealer named Carter Verone (Cole Hauser), but only in exchange if they erase his criminal records. They are also joined by Secret Agent Monica Fuentes to bring this sleazy miscreant to justice.",2015
7,"Before I start about anything. I was little disappointed with this movie. So second movie of The Fast and the Furious franchise didn't full my expectations. Brian is the only one of the main characters who stays in this film from the last film crew. The plot get little bit more action then the last movie so they filled up that part. They put the bad guy, so it gets some action. You still got some badass cars, but it is not about tuning this time. Races from 1/4 of a mile sprint now evolve into circuit races and highway chasing and running from police. The film is mainly about undercover mission to catch that bad guys similar to the last movie, but I miss that there is no one else from the old crew. Still this movie deserve 7, and current rate is underrated. Watch this movie, it won't have much roll into plot in later movie, don't have high expectations and you will like it. It is still worth seeing.",2013
8,"2 Fast 2 Furious is the sequel of The Fast and Furious, but everyone knows that. The races are very cool and exciting, looking like Need for Speed Underground.The nitrous boosts, the escape from the cops and the jump across the bridge were extremely cool. In the story, Brian O'Connor slept out the police and now he was living only for racing drags and things like that.But he was caught by a cop at the end of a race and had a proposal.He would help the cops investigate a drug seller or he would be arrested.Then the story flows.I will not tell everything about the story, if you want to know more go see the movie. The car parts are great, but some parts like the fight next Brian's boat was really boring. 8/10",2005
8,I think that 2 fast 2 furious is the best car chase film that i have ever seen. The acting is good and the stunts were well executed. ,2005
10,"Okay so what really counts is realism in my opinion. When he's revving the engine out and actually doing more than 100mph, I want the speedometer to report accurately. It's a little unrealistic but hey it's still a fun movie! The muscle car races are excellent and I recommend the movie to most people who enjoy fast cars and cute girls. The next movie should include more extended periods of engines revving and exhaust like the movie ""Bullet"". That movie had one of the most epic car chases ever on camera. Key point being realism, they actually video taped them in real life. Not in a CGI booth etc. More engines, revving, and lots of revving and volume! Rumbling of the exhaust of the engines. So in the theater we not only see the fast cars, but FEEL the engines rumbling in our seats. How about a movie that the guy is a test driver, he's running super sports cars across the nation from new york, to California. California to Bahamas etc while all the way bad guys are attempting to steal the cars. That's when verone and dahm and the gang come in to escort them across the nation. High speed racing across the nation like ""Cannonball Run""!!! Shelby Cobra GT500s or 1979 porsche 959, or 1995 lamborghini countach, or 1995 Ferrari F50... Cool amazing classics!!! Lots of flames from the exhaust and lots of cute girls screaming and enjoying the ride!!! Good LUCK!",2013

8,"2 Fast 2 Furious isn't quite as good as the first film but it's still a really good movie in its own right. The cast was great once again with Paul Walker returning to his role as Brian O'Connor and Tyrese Gibson and Eva Mendes adding new character dynamics. Tyrese in particular was great. If there's one thing the first film lacked it's that there wasn't much humor. It was a very serious film and while that's great, Tyrese's character, Roman Pearce, added some great laughs at some unexpected moments. The cinematic effects were much better in this film also. The only negatives were that some of the action sequences were a little overboard (Dukes of Hazard jump for example) and the dialogue had too much street car jargon to the extent that some of it felt forced. ""That Yenko will snap a speedo in 5 seconds"" is an example of the type of dialogue that doesn't actually feel genuine in its placement in the film. Nonetheless, a really good movie with solid acting and great action.",2013
7,"What made the first ""The Fast and the Furious"" movie attracted fans besides the bad ass cars and competition on the streets was Vin Diesel's appearance as Dominic Toretta, a hotshot race driver who makes his money racing others in the streets; he was a rising star on the fame after doing such flicks such as ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""The Iron Giant"" and later doing ""XXX"".",2008

This film is about Brian O' Conner who goes back to fighting crime with his buddy Roman Pearce and secret agent Monica Fuentes to bring down the notorious criminal Carter Verone. What I think people don't get about this film is unlike the first, this film is just plain out in good 'ol fun. This is definitely not meant not to be serious at any level. I would think people could tell just by how the actors play their characters. The acting is very good because you can see that the actors are having fun doing this flick to make it an actual fun movie. Even though it is a fun film, the action scenes are great. Like when the car flies onto that boat; I thought that was awesome!!",2006

10,"This is one of the most addictive television shows that has been aired in many years; It is finally on DVD, and I cannot wait until the premiere of the second season on January 9, 2005. The casting of this series is excellent- I especially love Linda Hunt as the voice of Management to Clancy Brown as Brother Justin to Michael Anderson as Samson- the whole cast is wonderful- along with the scenery and pace of the show; it does not have the ""rollar Coaster"" mentality, but rather sets up all of the characters so you begin either begin to care for them or despise them accordingly. THe First Season set up the cast of Characters, and from what I can tell, the second season will put everything in motion and have more action involved. I am going to go buy the season one on DVD as soon as possible (as soon as I finish writing this review). There have only been twelve episodes so far, and I hope there will be at least 30 more (or however many more it takes til the story is told.) I also enjoy the Carnie Lingo, and to see the contrast of how people lived in different areas. ",2004

6,"Carnivàle is essentially two stories: the realistic journey of a ramshackle carnival through dust-bowl America, and the magical, pseudo-mythological clash of ""Avatars"" that bleed blue blood, have high-contrast dreams, and say things in growly voices when their eyes turn black. The stories aren't particularly well intertwined; protagonist Ben Hawkins joins the carnival in the first episode but spends most of his time driving around solving mysteries, and many of the characters never interact with him at all.",2011
10,Isn't there any obligation to finish this story? It's not like its Sex in the City with a different topic each week. This is an unfinished continual story. It would be like J.K. Rowling saying I've decided not to write the final Harry Potter book. People would be very upset to say the least. I just don't think it's right to hook the viewer's into a series like this one and then cancel it. I think HBO should think hard about doing any type of continuing story line in the future. If they can't guarantee they will finish the story then what is the point in starting it? I didn't even bother to start watching the new series Rome. Here today and gone tomorrow should be the new tag line for HBO.,2005
10,"And so it happened with this TV show, both critically acclaimed and celebrated by fans, that it was cancelled due to an unfathomable (and probably personal) decision of the financing network. Having been one of the most original and addictive programs to be seen on TV so far, Carnivale was set up to run for at least 3, probably 4 seasons and now viewers are left with a lot of questions and no real answers after the show was prematurely terminated after only 2 seasons. This happened to other great shows as well (Futurama, Serenity, Odyssey 5) , many times just because some executives put personal grudges before reason. Let's hope that Daniel Knauf will find a way to give all us Karnies the rest of his epic story, even if it is in novelized form.",2005

10,"Ah yes, only the good die young. Whether it's James Dean or a multiple award winning HBO show, the wisdom applies in both cases - the demise of the latter of course thanks to the lack of paying viewers, and what doesn't make considerable profit is canceled regardless of quality. Thus Daniel Knauf's exquisitely conceived and meticulously prepared mystery show ""Carnivàle"" ended already after two out of the planned six seasons - but posthumously it has gained the nimbus of immortality among the fans, just like good old Jimmy. Maybe it's a good thing, as ""Carnivàle"" ended on a very high note, which seems difficult to top. And while there are also cliffhangers and some open questions when it is all over the main storyline of what Knauf referred to as ""the first book"" is concluded and key answers are given. Knauf also provided documents on character backstories and hinted on what might have happened in further seasons, so the interested fan will at least find a bit of satisfaction by searching the internet.",2012
10,"I found this late. Although I subscribe to HBO it was while my link was being fixed a technician told me about it. The description fascinated me. After I saw the 1st episode I was hooked. This was the movie I was seeking for years! Religion, spirituality, paranormal, the epic battle between good and evil, and with characters that seemed custom-made for their parts. There was not an episode that I didn't fully enjoy, and the abrupt, premature termination left me saddened. This series is along the lines of some modern occult mystery stories, but better, more real, deeper, and darker. Ye who have hope for the world and the people in it... see this.",2006
10,Anyone who has seen HBO's series of Carnivale knows just what the show is made of. It is a critics dream for it encompasses everything one could want in a television show immaculately. The story of a lost man being accepted to join a traveling carnival throughout country America in the 1930s and an obscure immigrant priest at the time quickly whirls into a majestic and intriguing tale with characters of many walks of life and supernatural powers. The actors suit their rolls and perform immaculately to bring to life this epic tale. The cinematography and the precise capture of the history and life at that time make the entire show a truly moving experience.,2006

5,"As a child, I read and loved the book, ""Cheaper by the dozen"", so I rented the movie expecting an on-screen adaptation of the book.  I think the only similarities are the title, and the fact that they have 12 kids.  The movie does the book a huge injustice.",2004
8,"A fairly amusing family comedy, with almost no relation to the book or the earlier film with this title. Steve Martin plays the father of the group of 12 kids who uproots them all to move to the big city where a football coaching job awaits.. suddenly the mom (an amusingly bemused Bonnie Hunt) gets called away on a book tour and dad has to raise all the kids himself. Interesting casting has Piper Perabo (star of the gloriously underrated ""Coyote Ugly"") as the oldest daughter, Hillary Duff as the teenage daughter, Tom Welling (of TV's ""Smallville"") as the oldest son and Ashton Kutcher taking an unbilled role as Piper's live-in boyfriend.. and poking fun at himself in the process. The rest of the kids are mostly of the unknown but cute variety,... and the kids get most of the laughs with their various schemes and screw ups along with Martin's reactions to it all. The ending drags a bit as things start to get serious and the family is on the verge of falling apart, but as long as it sticks  to the pratfalls the film can be very amusing. GRADE: B",2003
8,"After Martin's lackluster Bringing Down the House, this movie was a vast improvement. Martin is highly likable as a small town football coach who is offered the opportunity to move to Chicago to coach a major college football team. This opportunity is too good to pass up and since it is what Martin has wanted his whole life. The bad thing is that his large family, that is used to living the small-town lifestyle is forced to uproot and move to a totally alien environment in a rapid-paced big city. Martin's professional life clashes with his personal life, as his university boss wants him to spend all his waking hours concentrating on football, while his twelve children are all running into problems adjusting to the new environment and constantly need his attention. His problems get multiplied when his wife's career as a writer takes off and she is asked to go on a tour to promote her book, leaving Martin to be in charge of the 12 demanding children.",2005
1,"From perusing the variety of ratings imdb users have given this little family flick, one might deduce that imdb users have had a mixed response to it.",2004
8,"Cheaper By The Dozen is a great family fun movie. It is about a large family, (The Bakers') who have twelve children and they have to juggle their careers and being a parent. They move from their small old house to a very large house in a suburban street because the father (Martin) gets a great job opportunity that would be following his life long dream, but at the same time his wife (Hunt) also gets a great chance at her dream of being a published writer and she has to travel and be away from her kids. The comedy is very fun and exciting as the children like to plot against their eldest sister's (Perabo) boyfriend Hank (Kutcher) and his ""money making face"".",2005
1,This movie is not a remake and it is not based on the book by Frank Gilbreth Jr. and Ernestine Carey. The only similarity is the number of children. That is my main objection. I loved the book and the movie with Clifton Webb. I was looking forward to a new version of the real story. I was very disappointed that the entire story was changed. This movie was not based on the book any more than The Sound of Music was based on the story of the Jackson family.,2007
1,"In this G-d awful film (note: to enjoy this film a legal adult must either be brain-dead or intoxicated to the point of alcohol-induced blood poisoning), former humorist Steve Martin (he's not the least bit funny) plays a dad of 12 kids that do not look remotely like one another.  Nor do any of them look like either of their space-alien parents.  Dad gets his ""dream job"" as head football coach of his alma-mater and moves from your average farmhouse in Wisconsin (located somewhere in Canada) into a multi-million dollar mansion of a Chicago (also in Canada) suburb in a parallel universe.  On this planet neighbor children don't look remotely like their parents either so it must be normal to mate with gorillas, donkeys, and farm animals in general.  The everyday life shown to those duped into paying to watch this rubbish is shown.  Such enormously ""funny"" lines as (paraphrasing): ""I just Turtle-waxed my Chrysler LeBaron MXV Convertible"", ""Can you pass me the Kellogg's Special K cereal?"", the Bekins moving van, ""I don't have enough Kodak film for my Canon LRBB 35-mm camera"" and so forth wanted to make me puke.  Instead, I puked into the popcorn of the couple sitting next to me.  But the absolute best part of this waste of Kodak XCVUYMX Wide-Screen Type R movie film are the two cameo appearances of the Motorola RSX boom microphone.  Apparently the editors missed that part. Perhaps they were too busy counting their money from all the hundreds of product sponsors of this film to notice?  For absolutely everyone on this planet - there is hope that we too could do, at a bare minimum, a better job of acting as well as writing than this bunch.",2004
1,"Look.  I like Steve Martin.  I liked him in his early films, like The Jerk, and liked him later in All of Me and LA Story.  True, I walked out of The Man with Two Brains, but I wanted to give Cheaper by the Dozen a fair shake. I read no reviews, and had really warm memories of reading the book in the 1950's.  It (the book) was a funny, warm family story.  This film, however, is similar only in that there are 12 kids.  This film was horrible, boring, and seemed to get longer by the minute.  The kids' expressions were uniformly:  roll your eyes, and say the equivalent of ""Like Doh"" or ""Whatever.""  They spoke a rapid-fire lingo of sports announcers, and--before I go on--I say save your money.  I am embarrassed for Steve Martin.  There must be other ways to make a quick buck than churning out stuff like this. Read the book--it's old, but it's much better.",2003
2,"What a terrible film. Not enjoyable at all. It is depressing way more often than funny. The funny moments added together would equal about a minute of screen time. The rest of the film was a total waste. The characters are so annoying, that it is impossible to feel for them, even in the moments intended to be emotional. A household of undisciplined brats, and two parents who barely get along, are too easily dominated by their children, and who allow their children to control their career decisions, is not entertainment, it is annoyance at best. It is at times too realistic to the toughness of two career families to be enjoyable. People watch films to escape reality, not be painfully reminded of it. At other times, it is too absurd to be taken seriously. There is a happy medium between realism and surrealism. This film never achieves it. The story is so clichéd and predictable. Every single thing that happens on screen, you knew would happen before it did. If you are looking for a humorous film, or a touching film, or even an entertaining film, look elsewhere, this isn't it. If you are looking for an instructional manual on how not to raise children, then maybe this is for you.",2006
10,"Paycheck (2003) is very underrated John Woo's solid action futuristic thriller, that combines spectacular action sequences with a spellbinding mystery that keeps you guessing from beginning to breathtaking end. It is my John Woo's fourth personal favorite action film of his, that I absolutely love to death. ",2016
6,Philip K Dick wrote many stories which seemed to have great film potential. I never thought of this as one of them.,2005
8,"I went in to this film with relatively low expectations. Other reviews I had read led me to believe that this was a cookie cutter, run of the mill, made for tv-esque amnesia story. Nothing could be further from the truth.",2004
5,"First, let me debunk the myth that this is ""an awful movie"" as I keep reading  because it has some interesting (albeit unoriginal) notions and it often executes them well. More importantly, it will generally keep you interested by navigating futuristic concepts in a fast-spinning pace that will unable you to yawn or look at your watch. Secondly, in spite of its technologically-ridden science fiction premise, Paycheck does not fall prey to the fatal ""style over substance"" crime because it at least tries, which is more than I can say for its peers (Equilibrium, The Island, etc).",2006
7,"Don't let the naysayers keep you from giving Paycheck a look. I found it to be intelligent, inventive, action-packed fun. Ben Affleck does a very credible job playing a man that finds the secrets of new technology out for big paychecks and then has his memory erased. He is offered a huge amount to do just that but lose three years of his life in terms of what he remembers. Well, the film picks up quickly after the three years and Ben Affleck has been played foul by his employer or someone. The science fiction aspect is very involved but presented in a pretty comprehensible style. The film chronicles Affleck's collection of simple, every day items that have been sent to him by - himself - and each has a purpose he must soon discover. Director John Woo mixes lots of gritty, sometimes over-blown action sequences here and there(especially at the end), but they only enhanced the suspenseful nature of the film. The film works primarily because of its thoughtful, engaging script and the adequate acting of Affleck, Aaron Echhart, Colm Feore, sultry Uma Thurman, and always humorous Paul Giamatti. The profound(albeit somewhat lost in the action)lesson in the film's end resonated strongly for me and had me thinking about my future and OUR future here on planet Earth. If a film can do that, it can't be all that bad in my book. The film is based on the science fiction writing of Philip Dick, a great mind and perhaps a soothsayer to what lies ahead for all of us. A great theme for this film might be little things mean a lot OR thanks for the memories!",2006

8,"Yesterday, I saw the movie ""Paycheck"" and against the so-called rating I found the movie pretty good. This movie has everything that one can expect from a sci-fiction action thriller which carves it way beautifully during its course. The reviews have unnecessarily demeaned and underrated this movie and has spread bad-word which is not at all deserved by the movie. ",2011
10,Every movie has flaws so does this. This movie is pretty interesting and is also pretty obvious but it was fun to see how ben affleck uses his items wisely. the action in this was hardly like a john woo movie.,2004

1,"Paycheck is a very poor film. It has a weak story and was poorly written and plotted. It also has unremarkable actor, direction or action. Paycheck is based on a short story by Philip K. Dick. Some of his stories have turned into good films such as Blade Runner, Total Recall and Minority Report, but also some turkeys have also been made like Next and this film. I have only read one Philip K. Dick novel, The Man in the High Castle, which was a good read.",2008
5,"One of film critic Roger Ebert's pet peeves in the movies is when the killer hesitates before knocking off the good guy. He begins talking, instead of doing the job, and by then he is killed. I agree: it's stupidly insane.",2006
2,This film is pretty bad. It's starts of bright with an interesting premise which admittedly drew me in. After this though the film becomes less and less interesting as Affleck's character utilizes some items he's left himself in a brown paper bag to try and decipher the riddle that has resulted in him now being on the hit list of his former employees and wanted by the FBI. The plot is too convoluted and the clues that guide him towards escape are less than inspired. The direction/camera shots are pretty standard and at times it feels more like a TV movie than a John Woo flick. The action is predicable and cliché and some of the acting is pretty poor from the likes of Aaron Eckhart in particular. So to conclude this film involves some very boring characters doing partaking in some very boring chase sequences in order to live happily ever after...which is something I must try and do after watching this drivel. 2/10 (1*).,2011

8,"Horrors have a bad reputation for poor sequels and bad remakes, which is why when people heard there was a remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the general thought was that they would be butchering the classic(excuse the pun). ",2006
9,"I am a hardened spectator; that means, I have only seen a couple films in my whole life which I considered scary. I like horror films but usually get disappointed with them, as 99% of them do not frighten me in any way. This one did. It is an extremely consistent and successful effort to create a sense of horror which is, in the end, the ultimate means of the genre. It is not even about the plot; it is about the director's possibility to create an atmosphere of hopelessness which penetrates the film from the beginning on. The tension is built in a masterful manner, cinematic means like light, soundtrack and camera shots highlight the events in the most fitting way, the pace is just right, all elements contribute to a consistently thrilling and gruesome outcome. This film seems very modern in its effects and camera style but somehow retro in its imagery which is a successful tribute to the original version of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". A seldom example of a good remake.",2012
4,"TCM is an adequate horror film in its own right but will play better if you have not seen the original. The makers of the 2003 remake have stripped the original of its dusty, dirty intensity and its blacker than black humour and replaced them with a few Hollywood conventions so as not to challenge the audience too much. The problem is that 30 years later the remake is just so much more conventional than the visceral original. The directors do copy some of the original shots but see fit not to try to copy the nasty humour that made the original stand up to repeated viewings. Remember the scene in the original where Sally wakes up, tied to a chair, surrounded by the nightmare freakshow of a family and screams her very soul out whilst the camera zooms into extreme close up of her tear filled eyes as her tormentors laugh and taunt her? One of the great moments of 70's shock cinema. Well, here, its a lukewarm rehash where she comes to on the floor with all the horror of waking up with a bit of a hangover. Other pointless changes include trying to normalise some of the originals quirkier moments; originally they wanted to find out if their granparents bodies had been dug up by graverobbers; in the remake, they are on their way to see Lynyrd Skynard. And what happened to wheelchair bound Franklin? Here the nearest thing to a disability is that one of the characters wears glasses. And whats the deal with water? The house in the remake should have floated away the amount of leaky pipes it has. OK its not a BAD film despite using all the old tricks but it seems to me that if you want to see a great film you may as well watch the original and see some really good film-making",2004
7,"On August 18th, 1973, in Texas, the youths Erin (Jessica Biel), her boy-friend Kemper (Eric Balfour), their friends Andy (Mike Vogel) and Morgan (Jonathan Tucker) and the hitchhiker Pepper (Erica Leerhsen) are returning from a vacation in Mexico to a concert of the Lynnard Skynnard. Kemper is driving his van, when they see a disturbed young woman dangerously wandering on the road. They decide to help her, and the woman commits suicide inside the vehicle. They decide to look for a telephone to call the Sheriff, and they end in the house of Thomas Hewitt (Andrew Bryniarski), where their lives are threatened by the sick Leatherface and his deranged family.",2005
8,"This Is One Hell Of A Horror Film!!! I have to say too that the acting was very good, though I wonder how hard it is to fake fear when you see some of the scenarios the actors were in, but even the background actors (especially the actor portraying Leatherface and the wonderful R. Lee Ermey as the sheriff) are very good and add an element of paranoid fear to the film. The thing that shocked me most was how brutal and graphic the film was, the gore being very realistic, and used very well. Instead of buckets of blood, we get moments of horror that end in a very bright splash of red. And like the first, the most brutal killings are shot in a way so that you see what is happening to the victim but yet DON'T see it at the same time. This is not a perfect film. It is too decadently dark and a lot of people will hate the film for that reason, and it will be hard to see this as being a movie you will want to watch over and over and over again. But in saying that, I admit that that is why the film succeeds so well  they nailed the mood perfectly. They didn't grave-rob it from the original but created their own. As a horror fan I cannot recommend this film enough. It stands just behind 28 Days Later as the second best horror film in a year that has turned out pretty darned well for the genre. Yes, it is a remake, and yes, the original is better, but having said that, I also must tell you that this is a very well crafted horror film and a wonderful spook show ride. I dunno if I am happy that it is going to do well at the box office or not (it won the box office battle its opening weekend) because I don't know what that means for all the other propose remakes. But if nothing else, at least they didn't screw this one up.",2007

7,"This movie is meant to be brutal, dirty, disgusting, awe inspiring, and terrifying. It succeeds on being each and evry one. The movie, once it ""picks up"" is unrelenting, suspensful, and leaves you with an uneasy feeling. There is such a stong sense of hopelesness throughout the second half, such negative emotions are elicited without so much as a second of comic relief. Yes, there is some comedy, but its all in the first third or so of the movie. The movie drags for a bit at the beginning, but once it all begins, its some scary s**t. I am an avid horror movie fan, I watch everything that comes out. Nothing has really scraed me, at least not in years. This movie scared the crap out of me. I actually wanted to turn away at one point. I wanted to run, I had second thoughts, kind of like being on a rollercoaster for the first time. I left the theater with an uneasy feeling. I couldn't stop laughing nervously, I guess I was trying to cope with what I had seen. My girlfriend was absolutely terrified. Two girls behind us were literally crying becuase they were so terrified. All around us people were screaming, jumping, squirming. After the movie, everyone was saying ""that was the scariest movie I have ever seen"" and ""that was nuts."" I couldn't agree more. This movie really, actually, truly scared me. It was just so brutal. I felt terrified for the victims; I felt afraid of the villian (Leatherface was awesome). I loved this movie. It obvioulsy has flaws. The beginning was slow, there were like thirty ""jump scares,"" people walked around exploring stuff alone, etc etc. But this movie, if judged based on how much it did what it intended to do, gets a 10 out of 10. Easy. I thought this remake was going to be easy to stomach, I figured it was going to be ""hollywoodized."" I was dead wrong. This movie was insane, period.",2003

Im not saying that this is better then the original or worse, because in my opinion the two films were made very differently.  This isnt the exact same movie, there are different characters, and many scenes are different.  There are lots of similarities and references.  The movie had one of the darkest atmospheres ive ever encountered in a film and was extremely brutal and gorey.  A must see for a fan or the original and its sequels and horror films.

I watched this movie alone in the dark at midnight, with my DTS surround sound speakers, and it scared the HELL out of me! This movie intends to makes you feel damp, filthy and frightening. It takes itself very seriously, no jokes. The horror is non-stop, not allowing you to take a break. The fright and the gore satisfies most horror fans. Good style, good cinematography, well-directed.

This remake is nothing like the original. If anything, it's LESS gory, and not scary at all. The thing that makes the original scary is the sheer insanity of all the killing, and all the other things that happen to the main character (the dinner scene, for example...watching it still makes me want to cover my eyes). All the ""horror"" of the new version is from the old ""surprise!...something jumps out of hiding and makes a loud sound"" trick.

7,"Being one of the few commenter's on TCM that hasn't seen the original, and is only 15 years old, I thought my 2 cents in would be considered useful or interesting to contrast to that of other comments written on this movie. I watched this movie hoping to be freaked out. I wanted to scare myself. But to be honest, I spent most of the time critiquing the directing of this movie and the way Nispel has tried to create and attain the climax of this movie. The only thing truly massacred in this film was the potential of gore and thrill. The over-dramatic music, inappropriate choice of costume and actors massacred the message the producers were trying to get across. Like all slasher films, the only thing you're meant to achieve out of watching it is a few hours of having the sh*t scared out of you. And the sad thing is the raw thrill of this movie could have fulfilled that, but instead was squashed by its modernistic screenplay. Throughout most of the film, i believed the face shown on Leatherface was what was meant to be depicted as his own, only to realize that was a skin-made mask. I'm still waiting to find a villain truly horrific and disgustingly distorted that their image is tattooed into your mind every time you shut your eyes. The highlight of this movie would have been the scene with Jessica Biel and her limp friend finding refuge in a house that they first tried to secure shut with a lounge. I congratulate Nispel on the way he created the sense of being, for want of a better word, ""so close yet so far"" from death. The supposed ""footage"" found really killed this movie. Particularly when you've just been reading up on what this movie really is based on (which isn't, much to my friends dismay, a man psychologically challenged with a skin disease and a chainsaw). Above all, i felt lied to! The only thing people should take away from this ""slasher"" film is- JUST BECAUSE THEIR FILM EDITOR CAN MAKE A SCENE APPEAR 80 YEARS OLD FILMED WITH A 1950'S CAMCORDER DOESN'T MEAN THERE REALLY IS A DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILY OF CANNIBALS WITH A SON WITH SKIN DISEASE THAT TAKES HIS ANGER AND RESENTMENT OUT ON TEENAGERS BY DETACHING LIMBS WITH A CHAINSAW RUNNING WILD IN THE OUTBACK OF AUSTIN, Texas!",2005
10,"(SPOILER WARNING) It has been 30 years since the nation was shocked by the extreme carnage of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  Now, 30 years later and numerous horrible attempts to re-create it, we are presented with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2003.  It takes so much effort to create a remake that has the same shock value or scare tactics as the originals.  This is an example that had that success.  Although it was different, it had its moments that everyone actually thought as if it were the original.  It is a hip and scary film with a new twist to the teen horror genre.  And as for recent horror films such as, Cabin Fever, Freddy vs. Jason, Wrong Turn, and Cold Creek Manor; they add virtually nothing new to the genre.  This has the effect that had the theater screaming and talking about for weeks after.  Five estranged, hormone driven teens are on a road trip to Dallas, Texas for a Lynard Skinnard concert.  On the way they made a quick stop at the neighboring Mexico to buy a load of marijuana.  On their way, they pick up a stunned and extremely traumatized hitchhiker.  Disturbing comments and a graphic suicide lead to the gritty violent content and gore that we are faced with. Scenes of graphic torture involve a guy getting his knee sawed off and being hung on a meat hook through the back.  Adding to the torturing, it leads to rock salt being placed on the wound and where the knee once was.  The acting is surprisingly fresh and you become involved with the characters and find them greatly unfortunate instead of the way the victims usually die.  Most of time the characters are so dumb that you just want them to die.  In this movie, it is a different story.  In the final clips of the film, it shows `actual footage' of the real mass murderer most commonly known as `Leatherface.'  It gives a Blair Witch-ian style to it.  Disturbing and immensely scary, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is sensitive to gore and/or who scares easily.  I found myself glued to the screen, not being able to take my eyes away for one moment.  This is definitely one of the top horror movies I have ever seen and it brings a brand new meaning to the words scary and disturbingly violent.  The killings are so realistic and the gore as well.  I would recommend this movie for any horror fan and anybody that enjoys a good scare. 10/10",2003

The first time I watch it, I couldn't finish it because I did not understand it and I felt bored with the movie. The second time I kept watching I just enjoyed the movie and I wanted to know more, what will happen next. I think the movie end perfectly the trilogy, tough it did lack on a story and on the action, there very barely in it, that it was in the original and the second movie.

Revolutions is undoubtedly different from the previous films both in general and in terms of tone but why is that necessarily a bad thing? I won't be so arrogant as to say that the people who don't like this film are unintelligent. Whether or not people like a film or not is a subjective matter but I can't help feeling that the people who dislike (or even hate) this film are missing something because Revolutions is an intelligent, entertaining, beautiful, sad and moving picture.",2006
9,"The first Matrix movie is one of the more ground breaking movies in the last decade as evidence by a pretty massive influence on pop culture. I could immerse myself in this review of just how great I think the first movie is, but I digress. The second was received with so much hype that it couldn't possibly live up to in all fairness, but I thought the second movie was wildly entertaining and a bit like the first one in the fact that it made you think quite a bit after the movie was over (The first one ""blows your mind"" an over-used phrase when it comes to reviewing movies, but it certainly applies in this case).  However, I thought the second had too much action, I believe Keanu has close to 5 fight scenes.  Morpheus has one, Trinity has 2 I think, all this fighting I think cuts out of the plot which is why the the Matrix is cool to begin with.  The action is fun and out of this world at times, but without a good enough plot, a viewer can feel disconnected from the characters in the action.  The plot of the second movie I did enjoy, I just thought more time should have gone into it.  I thought there were many twists and turns and it ends with a decent ""cliffhanger.""",2004
9,"Matrix Revolutions is deliberately constructed as a puzzle in which you have to work out the complete picture for yourself. It contains some fundamental questions of philosophy, a war story of a hopeless struggle against the machines who besiege Zion and it comes to a conclusion which is not understood by many viewers. The philosophical questions are answered (e.g. some choices lead to a string of consequences which may often appear as predestination), the war scenes in Zion are overwhelming and the final scenes depict the reestablishment of harmony between body, mind and soul. The absence of this harmony being one of the major reasons for conflict and war.",2008

10,"Revolutions is much more concise and to the point than Reloaded was. The action is much more focused and purposeful, mostly because the movie is working its way toward a conclusion, rather than an open ending or a cliffhanger like either of the first two movies. The dialog is geared toward answering unanswered questions rather than raising new ones, and even the new questions raised in the third film can be answered by watching the film again (watch all three a few times over and you'll be as pointlessly knowledgeable about The Matrix universe as I am!).",2003
9,"Initially, I was expecting the movie to be more plugged into the matrix than unplugged from it.  After deciding to go back and see the movie a second time with that expectation already established, I watched it again and thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  I understood then that the movie really required to be primarily ""unplugged"" in order to make any type of sense at all and close the trilogy.  It didn't hurt that the second viewing was on an IMAX, as well.  The sound and effects were simply amazing once again, and in spite of all the negative reviews out there, I am satisfied with the trilogy as a whole.  I look forward to adding the DVD to my collection; it will be well worth the investment that is required.",2004

1,"What was the point of this trilogy? Why take the pill to begin with? What were they fighting for? In the end the free humans settle for survival, and trade slavery for the rest of humanity for their own survival. If ""peace"" is the most important thing, why start the fight? In the first movie they tell us that freedom is the most important thing--without it you aren't really alive. It's worth giving up your life in the matrix; it's worth living a life underground in sewers and caves; it's worth fighting and dying for. By the third movie freedom wasn't as important as any of that. Leave humanity in bondage to the machines. Leave the matrix running and leave the free people in their caves. Just give us peace.",2005
10,"So we have reached the end of Matrix. This was an amazing trilogy with a lot of metaphors which everybody have missed. Third film have it's down & ups just like the second. The problem is, first film was so perfect that everybody wanted to see the rest like that. But after all, we have a very effective trilogy here and it only shows you are not ready if you didn't like the second or third film. From that point you are free to choose disgracing yourself by saying ""this film sucks"", ""this is soo bad"" etc. etc.",2003
8,"Going into this movie I had one wish: To leave feeling that it was a successful conclusion to a two-part film.  Taking Reloaded/Revolutions as a single (very large) movie with an intermission is the best way to evaluate it.  Viewed that way I think it succeeded.  I thought Revolutions was the equal of Reloaded, yet I can see how many will think it failed.  The ending gave us everything we needed to know, but did not show us all we wanted to see.  I'm speaking of the last twenty minutes or so here.  After a visually robust middle, in which I felt my eyes grow larger in their sockets more than once, the ending seemed like an anticlimax. It needed to be longer, and I would gladly have traded some of the fx flair used earlier to give the final part of the film it's justified due.  It will be awhile before I can look at it more objectively (perhaps I'll have to wait to view the two parts as one on DVD).  I only suggest now that anyone seeing it let it sink in completely before being too critical.",2003

8,"Hollywood has never been very kind to aging couples. If you count a ratio of the movies that have been made with actors in their prime and put them side by side with movies where the same actors are reaching 50, 60, or even 70, you'd be hard-pressed to find more than a smattering over a decade's time. And to sell a romantic comedy above all to a youth-obsessed public wanting to see the inevitable tight curves on the female lead's body and the rippled muscles on the male's, where instead there are none, is a gamble that would surely signal a train wreck by default.",2005

Diane was delightful and sexy and a wonderful role model for older women.  Keanu showed more range than people give him credit for, and did an excellent job playing the role he was cast as - a supporting character, who is not supposed to outshine the lead roles, but rather enhance them (which he did). I was very pleased with this movie!  It did have ""several endings"" which, actually, didn't detract but instead made me think, ""Well, that's closer to the reality of what might happen,"" instead of being annoyed.  As Jack's character says, ""Finally, closure,"" and I was happy.  It was a good movie and I liked it quite a lot.  It'll be on my mind and in my thoughts for a while, which is the sign of an impactful movie.",2003

It would have been nice to see more input from Frances McDormand and Keanu Reeves, but otherwise I really enjoyed the movie.",2004

To my surprise, I liked it.  I too am a woman ""of a certain age"" and I found myself responding to this movie very much in the context of a woman Diane Keaton's age.  I laughed to tears over her creativity surge-- she very accurately portrayed that kind of grief over a relationship lost... amazing!  I must say however, that if I were in a position to choose between Keannu Reeves and Jack Nicholson.. well there's no decision to make--the young stud muffin would win in a heartbeat!...(although Jack really was quite charming once he got over being such a putz)..

10,"Of the many things I like about going to the movies there are two experiences that always stand out more than others.  The first is going to see a film that you have so-so expectations for and finding out that it is not only better than expected, but very good indeed.  The second is going to see a film you have high expectations for and not being disappointed. Something's Gotta Give falls squarely into the second category.",2003

But friends told me this one is different--it's fresh, it's funny, it's different.   Well, it's not.  Nicholson is Nicholson, only more so.  The other actors are OK, but they get pushed out of Nicholson's huge ego.  The story is inane and boring.  Some of the scenes involving Nicholson's anatomy are disgusting.  The ending is as implausible as it is predictable.  Yep, hard to believe you could come up with something both implausible and predictable, but once you buy into the bizarre premise that (spoilers ahead) Amanda Peet is hot for Nicholson's flabby body, and that Diane Keeton would give Nicholson a second thought after Keanu Reeves puts the moves on her, then you'll believe anything.  Worse than how Nicholson looks is the utterly despicable and self-centered character he plays.  That he winds up with an attractive woman who adores him only goes to show that if you have lots of money you can get whatever you want, even love.",2004
1,"Perhaps it's because I'm not over 40, but I did not enjoy ""Something's Gotta Give"".  I cannot fathom ever, and I mean EVER actually CHOOSING Jack over Keanu.  I mean COME ON!!!  So besides this movie's wildly ludicrous ending and setting it is also not a comment on what women think or feel, but what men believe they should think and feel.  So I guess with that view it's hardly surprising that a lecherous fat old man who had dated her daughter, messed up her house, and insulted her in her own home was Diane Keaton's pick of the heap.  I don't know where writer Nancy Meyers gets these ideas. Wouldn't it be nice to see a movie where the women ends up with a young handsome man who treats her well and adores her?  I don't see how laughing over being unable to see the time on a wrist watch without your glasses constitutes finding one's soul mate.  Was I on crack or was it Keanu's character who had seen all Diane's plays and loved her work?  Clearly Diane's work is almost biographical so isn't it actually Keanu who ""gets"" her?  And why is Diane so uncomfortable kissing a man who is 20 years younger than she, but Jack has no problems having sex with a woman 40 years his junior in her mother's home.  Anyway, this film is just not what I thought it would be.  It had some funny moments sure, but I still left the theater feeling empty.  I certainly do not believe it is in any way a good take on romance in old age.",2003

2,"I ticked 'spoilers' but I think any depiction of a spoiler here would enhance this bomb. I kept waiting for a script to happen and wondered why I was so irritated ALL THE TIME. Diane Keaton ( I honestly can't believe she got a Golden Globe award for her performance) acts as if there is always a third party in the room. She keeps glancing sideways and laughing flirtatiously at NOTHING. Jack just phones his performance in, enough said.....and speaking of laughing, I, for one, hate those scenes where the main characters are on a beach, over dinner, in bed, and they are laughing, laughing, but you the viewer are not privy to the stream of jokes. And believe me there are so much of these giggling no-script scenes as to make you NAUSEOUS. You are on the outside, paying your decent money to be part of the movie/play but you are left guessing as to what is actually being said. RIP-OFF. Seems to me as if the writer just ran out of script. Speaking of which, there is NONE, no script, in this sodden wreck of a film. It is rocking with clichés (the sobbing, crying, has to be the very worst ever captured on film). And what was Keanu Reeves doing in it? Here's a young doctor madly in love with the older woman playwright, has seen all her plays and absolutely worships her, is kind, considerate and fresh (vs jarringly jaded), but the older woman just hankers after moronic old Jack who treats her incredibly badly. And in the end, unbelievably - Keanu, her new fiancé, gives her up without a fight or a word. He is just deleted from the script. I for one would have chosen Keanu any day.

In Something's Gotta Give, there is a period where she has to cry in brief scene after scene, and either she can't cry or the direction was very, very poor (I kind of think it was the latter). For me, her crying symbolizes everything that was bad about this movie. In the crying scenes, she just wails and wails - loudly. After awhile, it is supposed to be somewhat funny (I think), but it's really just kind of annoying. The crying is supposed to convey that she is getting over what is hurting her and channelling it into a more productive activity. But it just feels so disingenuous because of the brazen way it is portrayed. There is a way to get crying to be sad at first and then funny (see Broadcast News), but this ain't it. This crying is more like ""Ooh, look. It's Diane Keaton trying to ball her eyes out.""",2004

I give it another point for Frances McDormand--I'm not sure why she chose to be in this movie, but for the little screen time she had, she was good. Everything else about this movie was mediocre. The writer/director, Nancy Meyers, obviously wrote this story about herself, and in this way made her main character a writer who is writing a story about herself. I find this whole phenomenon incredibly tedious. This is the same problem I had with Adaptation, but at least Adaptation featured characters outside the realm of the ""New York/The Hamptons"" bourgeois lifestyle which I find to be over-portrayed and about as interesting as a thumb tack.",2004

I found this film a good entertainment. There are lots of action, funny moments and in the end, it is a good action movie. The beauty of the unknown Jaime King is very impressive.

I love Chow Yun-Fat and I'm a major martial art nut but this film just made martial arts look bad. Compare this to Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or House of Flying Daggers and it doesn't even come close to the brilliance of these two films. John Woo...this was not one of your best pieces of work. The enemies were typical and idiotic. I was yawning all the way through. You need a film to keep you interested and wanting to find out what happens next.

Lots of fighting and gags, and Fat and Williams work well together. The contents of the scroll, which bounces back and forth between the good guys and bad guys, provides something of a surprise near the end. Roden makes the perfect villain, and the climactic fight between Roden and Williams is eye-popping. Wire fu abounds, but this is a fantasy flick, after all, and not to be taken seriously.

There are only two real criticisms I have about this film the first is that I felt that the Kar/Monk relationship could have been built upon a bit more, when Kar says (just after monk has been kidnapped) Monk is the only family I've got I though but u only new him a few days, if they were supposed to had trained even for a few weeks I could had believed there bond a bit better.

Archaeologist and explorer extraordinaire, Lara Croft, journeys to a temple which has sunken underwater in search of lost treasures. During her expedition, Croft happens upon a sphere that contains the mythical Pandora's Box, only to have it stolen from her by Chen Lo, the leader of a Chinese crime syndicate. Chen Lo is in league with a bad guy named Reiss, who wants to use the priceless Box as a doomsday weapon. The plot sounds okay but the main reason someone would see this film is for the action scenes and Angelina Jolie. People just wanting those two things will probably enjoy this film. People that want a good story and better direction should skip this film. The action scenes are really cool and are done well. However, the story is weak and the film doesn't quite make sense at times either. I think the person that should be blamed is Jan de Bont. He is a terrible director and can't build up suspense very well. He did a bit better then Simon West but still the studio should have hired someone else. The acting is good not great but nothing horrible either. Angelina Jolie does a good job of playing Lara Croft and she is also very breathtaking in the film. Gerard Butler does a good job as well though sometimes his performance wasn't very interesting. The action scenes are really cool and are done well. Another problem I had with this film is that it gets boring at times. Having a lot of action doesn't mean its audience will be entertained. The movie's running time is 117 minutes which is a bit longer then the original. I think they could have cut the film down to about the same length as there some pointless scenes. If you hated the original then you should skip this film as the film is more of the same but it is more entertaining. As long as you don't try to notice too many of the mistakes in the film then you should enjoy it. If your looking for a serious action flick then just skip this. Rating 6.8/10",2005

Lara is having none of that, and enlists her former partner Terry Sheridan (Gerard Butler - The Phantom) to help find it and keep it away from evil doers.",2005
5,"ANGELINA JOLIE makes the most of showing her prowess at performing stunts that any male would envy, but the showcase for her physical skills is hardly worthy of her presence. The script is as shallow as the video game it is based on and no one has much of a chance to give any depth to their characters.",2005
6,"This second movie in the 'Tomb Raider' series was a disapointment for me. I was not a great fan of the first one either. Certainly Angelina Jolie is as sexy as you can get, but there is too little else in her character to make her the female James Bond that the authors of the series want her to be. Even the sentimental track in this second movie does not succeed to make her more real. Director Jan de Bont succeeded much better with the original story in 'Speed' or the reality-TV like effects in 'Twister'. In 'Tomb Raider 2' he is just mixing a potion of James Bond with a little bit of Indiana Jones, without too much of a result. If you did not see it yet, you may as well wait for the DVD. 6/10 on my personal scale.",2003
2,"When I look at Jan De Bont's resumé, I think of all the brilliant Dutch projects he has worked upon, and then I think of the films he has directed in America. The gulf between the two is such that even the less discerning can't help but be amazed. This is, after all, the guy who worked alongside one of Holland's favourite sons, the legendary Paul Verhoeven, on such indisputable triumphs as Turks Fruit or Flesh + Blood. To call directing such dreck as Speed or Tomb Raider 2 a comedown is a form of flattery.",2004
7,"Let's face it, the James Bond franchise has become rather limp lately. ""The World Is Not Enough"" was a debacle of miscasting and an an endless parade of meaningless subplots and tertiary characters.  ""Die Another Day"" suffered from much of the same, but was also saddled with an inexplicable amount of stereo feedback and one of the oddest (if catchiest) theme songs in recent memory.  The series has been re-energized with the new entry ""The Cradle Of Life,"" a high-spirited, far-reaching film that doesn't quite succeed but is such an improvement on the originals that you're ready to overlook all that.",2003
10,The second film was better than the first one in the sense that it relates to stories that are more accurate to the video games. However the fantasy used to create the stories of the video games does not suit very well hollywood movies. Successful video game stories turn out to be cheesie on the movies and a movie stories of video game characters are too far away from the original. ,2003
1,"Where to start?  I'll start by saying i was near leaving the theater, something i have never done before.  I only stayed cuz i was with my friends and we were havin a good time makin fun of it.  If u've been following the talk shows and what not u'll know that Jolie has been saying that she tried to add depth to the character.  That failed miserably.  What's worse is that in attempting to add depth to the character they tried to write a good plot. It was a horrible plot.  Predictable and trite.  To just put the icing on the cake in trying to write a good plot they ignored making good action scenes.  So the result was scenes that just looked somewhat stupid.  A flip here and there that was totally unnecessary and (spoiler) a missed gunshot from 5 feet away from some guy who was supposed to be an expert karate master/soldier.  She even had her back turned.  I could have shot her.  I wish someone did.  So the bad plot took over the movie.  U know, I wasn't even expecting a good plot, i was just expecting good action and a plot just so there could be more action.  But no they had to ruin it and write a really bad plot and ignore making good action scenes.  When they're showing this movie on pay per view don't even bother watching it even if u steal ur cable.",2003

4,"Considering ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"" was pretty good entertainment, this sequel was a disappointment. Critics disagreed and liked this one better, but I disagree with them. As with most sequels, it just overdoes what was popular in the first film.",2006
10,"I thought the movie was nicely paced, and the action was, to say the least, pretty darn good.  Granted, the story line could have been ""fished"" out a bit, Ms. Jolie's action made up for that short fall.  Being a huge fan of Mr. Chris Barrie, it was nice to see the character of Hillary have more to do than just clean up after the mansion gets raided.  Let's hope the next installment has the same action, fast paced locations and even more realism in the storyline.  All in all, The Cradle of Life hits almost all the right notes.  Ms. Jolie has done some fine work here.",2003

1,"It's doubtful if there will be a worse film this year then Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life.  I was a fan of the original film, but I'll be the first to admit that there was room for improvement.  Tomb Raider 2 promised to improve on the original, but surprisingly, it's almost unwatchable.  The action scenes are perhaps the most dull you'll see this year, and the always entertaining Jolie sleepwalks through the picture. From the unremarkable opening, and throughout the picture, the film has the attitude that it just doesn't care.  The film has no flare, which is surprising because director Jan De Bont is usually known for his over-the-top style.  What a waste of a picture, and probably the final nail in the coffin for this franchise.",2003
1,"What a world we live in. we're in the middle of an economic decline yet people still feel inclinsed to throw money into a bonafide stinker like Tomb Raider 2. The first one wasn't even that great, yet the justification for a new chapter was still issued. Let's face it, Angelina Jolie's accent has worn out its welcome as much as her daily appearance on the gossip pages. Hopefully, Jan De Bont's failed and miserable career will be officially dead after this,",2003

Plainly, the passage is through the Indiana Jones series, and several of the James Bond installments, including ""Dr. No"", ""Goldfinger"", ""Moonraker"", ""A View to a Kill"", and ""Tomorrow Never Dies"". Note her partnering here with a 'rogue Scot'. ""Mission Impossible 2"" and ""Point Break"" are thrown in for good measure.",2006

Well laura croft was at it again trying to find some treasure, (I forgot what it was because I fell asleep). Then I tried watching it again then I fell asleep. The action sequences don't even get you into the movie. The acting good but the storyline didn't really draw me in this movie. I tried giving this movie a chance and I'm not a person who wants it extactly with the video game or something, I didn't want a movie that would change my life or anything, just an enjoyable movie I can watch over and over again.

2,"As a fan of the Tombraider video game, and of Angelina Jolie, as well as a fan of the original film, I was raring to see this film. Especially after many critics claimed it was better than the first. I'm not sure exactly what made them say that, but boring action scenes, mostly poor dialog, and less screen time for Christopher Barrie made for a far worse film than the first. If you are going to make a tongue-in-cheeck action film, you don't need a believeable plot, or a brilliant script, but you do need exciting action sequences and funny one-liners. There were perhaps 3 scences in this movie that weren't boring, not worth the $6 I paid (yes, I only paid $6, I'm a student, and I'm not in a metro area).",2003

7,"I think us movie buffs sometimes forget that not all movies are made to have some sort of under lying message that can or will change our lives. That's why it pains me to see some users give this film a bad review because ""the dialog is weak"" or ""the scenery isn't vibrant"" or something along those lines. This is not a stab or an insult to you, but what I'm saying is; sometimes movies are made with one intended purpose... ENTERTAINMENT! I could careless if this film had poor actors, poor script, poor lighting, that doesn't matter when you watch an action film. This movie delivers your monies worth too, in my opinion Will Smith and Martin Larwence make such a great team that part of the fun is just watching these two get into it from time to time. And with Michael Bay directing, you know you're going to get some good action scenes. Let's face it, Bad Boys II has one of the best car chase scenes ion recent history, it dominates the dismal over played chase in Matrix Reloaded which was the other big summer sequel of that year. I think all that needs to be said here in a retort is the movie is an action movie ans needs to be looked at as an action movie. To hell with the elements that the Academy looks at, appreciate the film for all the stuff that blows up and the laughs the cast can bring you to.",2005

I for one am gonna defend the guy here.  And no, i'm not some idiot teenager who thinks Charlie's Angels is the best movie ever made.  I am an avid film watcher.  I probably see close to 100 movies a year IN theaters.  Big movies and small alike.  I appreciate any genre of film if it's done well.  But obviously my first love is, and always will be, action.

10,"This movie was a hell of a lot of fun to watch. The action sequences were really well done, and there was tons of them. It was a lot more violent than the first one as I noticed. I thought the scene with all the cadavers was really unnecessary. It was kind of gross. And the chemistry between Will Smith and Martin Lawrence is great. The arguments really reflect from the first one. I was really enjoying the tense scenes where the cars were flying off the truck. A great movie. 8 out of 10.",2003
10,"I just got back from seeing Bad Boys 2 and it was the coolest move ever.  It had so much action in it topped off with comedy.  For a 2 and 1/2 hour movie it didn't seem that long at all.  I loved that it didn't have a whole lot CGI effects in it.  I liked how they actually destroyed the cars and how they really blew up that mansion, no fake model stuff.  This was just as cool as the first movie was but a little bit better and cooler.  I don't know how the critics in different areas rated the movie but the ones in my area only gave it 1 and a half stars.  I think it deserves at lease 3 and a half to 4 stars.  I can't what for this movie to hit DVD I be there to get it definitely the first day it hits shelves.  If you haven't go and see this BAD movie.",2003
7,"This was a really fun movie to watch. It has some intense action sequences. Actually, a lot of intense action sequences. The shooting never stops and the explosions keep on coming. Martin Lawrence and Will Smith are hysterical, again. And Joe Pantoliano makes every movie better. The two funniest scenes are when Burnett and Lowery are scaring the hell out of Burnett's daughter's date and after the chase scene with the dead bodies and Captain Howard goes off on the two. Absolutely hilarious! My only gripe is that it seemed that the writers were running low on material and resorted to gross-out humor like rats having sex and corpses losing their heads. Not funny. Otherwise it was very funny, due to the amazing chemistry between the two leads. I still prefer the original Bad Boys, but this is still a great time at the movies. 7/10",2003
8,This movie was very entertaining.  It had me wanting to watch all the way until the end.  It was about 30 minutes too long I'm afraid though.  There were many times that I thought there were scenes that could have been cut and still made this movie funny and with great action.  Some of the parts were a little overacted as well.  All in all I thought this was a good film and I will watch it over and over again for a few scenes.  It does have some horrible language in this movie so do not let you kids see it unless you don't care if they repeat what they see.  Check the movie out if you are of age.  It's a good film.,2003

Again we have the usual camaraderie of two old friends who are also partners in the police, non-stop action and stunts that keep the average action junkie interested like myself. As for plot and storyline, I would say Bad Boys 2 has a reasonable one. I could compare Bad Boys 2 to the original, and come up short with anything new but what I do come up with is the same as with the original. Bad Boys 2 gives us more of what the first film had, only this time in 2003 and not 1995.",2008

The action in the movie is unlike any movie, the only movie I've seen with better action was another Michael bay movie and that was transformers. Bad boys 2 is great all around, great action, great acting, great music, and amazing cars. The movie is very entertaining, it goes back and forth between action and comedy all the way through.

The movie is full of spinning camera angles in about 97,6% of the time. C'mon Mr. Bay, the effect of the circling camera works about once in a 90 min movie if well placed. It is not cool at all when used three times (in slow motion) for every 90 seconds all the way.",2004
8,"It must be awesome being Michael Bay. I mean, can you imagine any other director who is given mega-budgets every few weeks and told to blow up more than he did in his previous movies? In the first Bad Boys film an air-plane hanger was blown to bits and was swiftly followed by an asteroid being nuked in Armageddon and the destruction of Pearl Harbour in...uh, Pearl Harbour. Not to be undone, Bad Boys 2 has him indulging in not one, but two chaotic car chases where muscle cars which most of us would spend our lives saving up for are torn to pieces like yesterday's newspapers and rounding everything up by detonating a sizable part of Cuba. If this trend continues, there won't be a building left standing in the whole of North America once Transformers is through. Not bad for a smug little geek with a rubbish haircut.",2007
1,"""Bad Boys II"" is quite likely the worst movie I have seen this year, and in a summer that gave us both ""LXG"" and ""From Justin to Kelly"", that's saying a lot.  I left the film feeling irritated and angry that two and a half hours of my life were spent exposed to unoriginal, vulgar, poorly edited and written tripe.  I enjoy a good action movie.  Chase scenes and things going SPLAT and KABOOM can be fun, but Michael Bay manages to drag every moment for what seems like an eternity.  Several scenes manage to plagiarize one another, and often felt like clips from the trailer instead of part of the movie.  The continuity is horrible, and a chase scene that ends with the ""heroes"" crashing their car into a body of water, is immediately picked up on a road somewhere!  ",2003
10,"This was bar-none the best action I have seen in years!!! I am not only one of the most critical people I know when it comes to movies but I'm also not a Michael Bay fan. Oh My God!!! Most action films now-a-days are just ho-hum and use warmed over effects and stunts from other films, but this one pulls out all the stops. When I first saw the ads for this film last year, I said to myself, ""Why are they making a sequel to that film?"" Not only that, but why did they wait 8 years to make it. Needless to say, I didn't have much faith in this film. The underwhelming trailers didn't help either. Boy, was I wrong. This was the summer film I didn't know I wanted to see. Most action films are mere spectacle, but I actually felt this one in my gut. None of the sequences give up one inch of slack. This film is on major steroids. Oh...and did I mention the comedy? The exchanges between Martin Lawrence and Will Smith are completely raw and off the chain. I don't even like Martin Lawrence!!! This had to be one expensive movie, especially at 2.5 hours long. I was so pumped up after leaving the theater that when I got home I immediately put on some Slayer. This film is that good. This is by no means an Oscar winner, but who cares.",2003
8,"Bad Boys is one of the Best Cop Buddy movies I've seen. Two hours, packed with Action and Comedy. Will Smith is back in a Comic role and delivers a good performance. Martin Lawrence is one of Hollywoods underrated funniest actors. He is ever so funny in this sequel to Hit movie Bad Boys. Part One was very funny and enjoying. In my opinion, Part Two was more funnier and had some good violence and stunts. The funniest scene is when they both have a conversation alone in the electronic shop and it gets recorded and misunderstood. Some Great Stunts including the car chase sequence, where cars get chucked at. This is one non stop entertainer, not to be missed.",2006

It was hilarious Will and Martin were really funny especialy Will in the scene where some poor kid comes to take Martin's daughter out to the movies.  The main reason critics were unkind with this movie is because it had a lot of racially motivated jokes and unfortunately critics are trying to be politically correct and not loosen up.

8,"Wide-eyed, hard-working young woman in Holland circa 1665 leaves home for a job as scullery maid to a painter and his family; quickly, she becomes the artist's secret assistant and muse, eventually posing for Vermeer's famous title-named portrait. Stunning art direction, lively pacing and an absorbing narrative all make up for a few key performances which seem too modern, and minor instances where the editing isn't as sharp as one might hope. The maid's many entrances and exits are repetitive, but Scarlett Johansson proves to be a very intuitive actress who excels in a role with very little dialogue. Quite good overall, with a finale that smartly leaves the breathless viewer wondering...asking...wanting more. ***1/2 from ****",2006
9,"Girl with a Pearl Earring is based on the novel by Tracy Chevalier, who tells the story of a forbidden love affair (pardon the cliché) between painting master, Johannes Vermeer (Colin Firth), and the only woman who seemed to appreciate his work, a timid young maid named Grit (Scarlett Johansson).",2004
10,I was fascinated by that movie. Every scene looked like a painting and they perfectly captured Vermeer's light . I also liked the historical references to how Vermeer liked to paint young people so he could work on big surfaces of colour and avoid the shading wrinkles give. The music was beautiful and gave off a Dutch feeling of the 17th century as it should have. The time customs that were mentioned are also a great asset.Griet looked so much like Vermeer's original painting that I thought in a moment that this was real (but of course it couldn't cause back in 17th century were no cameras around :p).It was a perfect movie for someone interested in art. Other might find it a bit tiring but if you are an art lover you definitely have to watch this.,2004
8,Is this an incredibly dull movie about a single painting - or is it a mesmerising and penetrating insight into art and a particular 17th century Dutch artist? It probably depends on your point of view.,2004
9,"I can't imagine a lot of people, especially anyone under 40, sitting through this extremely slow film....but I thought it was excellent. However, I am biased because I love great cinematography and stories about famous painters. Sometimes the cameras stay on subject longer than normal, affording the viewer time to really soak it up. ",2006
9,"I have just seen ""Girl with a pearl earring"" and I am already willing to see it again. The feeling is very much the same as wanting another tour in a gallery of paintings of old Dutch masters, to enjoy repeatedly the beauty of light and shadow and colours. Scarlett Johansson is both very pretty and talented and the camera lovingly moves around her, searching for her beautiful eyes and puffy lustful lips, very much reminding me of Bertolucci's love for the beauty of Liv Tyler in ""Stealing beauty"". Colin Firth is again producing a most powerful impact by his tall dominating figure, deep beautiful voice and reserved yet sensual and passionate attitude. A strikingly good picture in the ocean of mediocre productions.",2005
8,"""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" tells a fictional tale about how the title painting by 17th century Dutch painter Vermeer might have come to be. Outwardly, the film is a story about the painter and a household maid who becomes the subject of the painting. Inwardly, the film is about the unspoken but palpable feelings between two people of very different stature and station which may or may not be forever cast in the crazed pigments of the masterpiece. Those who can tap into the subtle human emotional undercurrents will find this film far more satisfying than those who cannot. Regardless, all will find ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" a masterpiece of filmmaking. (A-)",2004
9,"In Delfti, Holland, 1665, the poor seventeen years old Griet (Scarlett Johansson) is hired as a maid in the household of the Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer (Colin Firth), to maintain her family. The Vermeer family is supported by the powerful and wealthy commissioner Van Ruijven (Tom Wilkinson), and is totally dependent on the inspiration of master Johannes Vermeer to keep their high standard of living as if they were rich. When Griet arrives in the breast of Vermeer's family, she understands the relation of power among the members of the family and Van Ruijven, and meanwhile, a platonic love and attraction develop between Johannes and her, due to her feelings and perspective relative to his work. ""Girl With a Pearl Earring"" is a magnificent contemplative art work and a beautiful dramatic romance based on a famous painting, which has this name. It is known that the maid who worked in Vermeer's house was the model and inspiration for such a piece of arts. However, the dramatization, based on an adaptation of Tracy Chevalliers's novel, is a fiction. The reconstitution of Delftt in the Seventeenth Century is amazingly perfect, being based on paintings of that time. Watching this film, the viewer feels as if he or she were seeing paintings at an exhibition, and if he or she pauses the DVD on any scene, will have a magnificent painting on the screen of the TV. The intense performance of the cast and direction are overwhelming, highlighting the spectacular Scarlett Johansson, who is in my opinion, one of the best ""new""actress in the cinema industry. Most of the feelings and sensations of the characters are transmitted through the looks and expressions of the actors and actresses. This movie had three Oscar nominations in 2003 (cinematography, art direction and costume design) and two Golden Globe nominations, and is highly recommended to any viewer who appreciates arts. I am a positive fan of movies, I always try to find the beautiful points or entertainment it can offer, instead of looking for destructive parts, like most of the professional critics do, but ""Girl With a Pearl Earring"" has superseded my uppermost expectations. My vote is nine.",2005
4,"After being assaulted by the Vermeer-painting cover of 'Girl with a Pearl Earring' in Barnes and Noble for months after it was released, I finally acquiesced and bought a copy. The concept of the novel is a fictional exploration of the creation of that Vermeer classic, and suggests that the model is Grit; a young girl in 1600's Holland whose family falls on hard times after her father is blinded, so she is sent to work for the family of Johannes Vermeer, the master painter. She does the back breaking work for the family and deals with the many difficult children and the mistress of the house, but then eventually strikes up a friendship with and develops romantic feelings for Vermeer, culminating with her posing for the painting.",2004
1,"To quote Tracy Chevalier, the originator of this pseudo-historical rubbish, ""Girl with a Pearl Earring is a story about a painting and how it came into being"". However, 'Girl with a Pearl Earring' is not a story about ""a painting"" as she put it; it is the title of a famous masterpiece that has been admired for over three centuries; the exquisite work of Dutch master Johannes Vermeer. ",2004
3,"It's hard to think up ideas for novels. So hard that eventually you make a novel that's a fictional story about a painting. When it gets down to that, it's sad, but then when they make a movie about it is the lowest tier. That's the case with Girl with a Pearl Earring, an insanely overly dramatic version of Tracy Chevalier's supposedly acclaimed novel. The results by this half-baked script by Olivia Hetreed are unintentionally hilarious. I mean this, I was almost rolling on the floor with laughter during this movie.",2004
2,"Last night I was feeling edgy. That fidgeting edginess that seems to arrive and then settle in for the evening. Then I pressed play on my video and half an hour later I was, according to my girlfriend, sleeping like a baby. Cue the jabs in the ribs that forced me to endure the remainder of this anaemic folly. I must say that I am often a fan of films in which very little of any consequence occurs. The previous night, for instance, I had loved every minute of The station Agent. This sort of film however can only work if it manages to engage. And in this The Girl with a Pearl Earring, for all its beautiful costumes and scenery, spectacularly fails. Colin Firth plays the same role we all know by heart, and Scarlet Johansson simply fails to bring any sympathy or life to her character. Tom Wilkinson is as good as ever, but his character is so one dimensional you wonder whether he has simply been copied and pasted from a comic book of villains. I was left rather annoyed by this pointless work. Firstly because I had been woken up to suffer it, and secondly because every time I see the beautiful painting that inspired it, I will be left with the painful image of a mute Scarlet Johansson and a mute Colin Firth in a room together, with not an ounce of tension between them.",2005
2,"This is definitely an art film. Beautiful cinematography, but not much plot. I think having read the book prior to seeing the movie spoiled it for me. There were so many touching parts of the book, which were omitted and I think vital to understanding the main characters and the time period. This movie needed much more character development to gain my attention. Other than the beautiful costumes and scenery, I was quite bored. I normally like Johansson as an actress, but found her quite annoying in this movie. Griet was portrayed to be too insipid. Who wants to watch an insipid main character for 2 hours? Also, annoying were the multiple accents in the movie. This movie needed a lot more consistency. I feel this was a poor adaption of the book. I can only hope someday someone will create a better movie of it.",2006

1,"The director of this film seems to believe that having a passing acquaintance with Vermeer's lighting style (or knowing a Director of Photography who does) is sufficient substitute for narrative, nuance, characterisation, composition or or any other kind of cohesive idea at all. Unfortunately it is not. Some of the images are pretty but none so beautiful, poignant or so suggestive of inner meaning as Vermeer's original which closes the film. The wait isn't worth it. The script and direction are utterly inept. Hopeless. Some points to the Art Department and a glimmer of promise in the performance of Scarlett Johansonn, which almost transcends the total lack of direction. See LOST IN TRANSLATION to see what this extraordinary young talent is capable of in the hands of a director who knows what she is about. Otherwise, visit an art gallery or read the book rather than endure this tedious botch.",2003

Granted, it is a pleasant time at the movies, but as far as telling us something about the genius behind a meager art production that the world has come to love and cherish, it will have to wait for another film with better material than this one.",2003
1,Beautifully filmed piece of boring crap.,2004
8,"I really do not know what people have against this film, but it's definitely one of my favourites. It's not preachy, it's not anchored by it's moral, it shouldn't be controversial. It's just God. Any possible God, no matter the religion. And it's really funny.",2003
9,"Jim Carrey is back to much the same role that he played in The Mask, a timid guy who is trying to get ahead in the world but who seems to be plagued with bad luck. Even when he tries to help a homeless guy from being harassed by a bunch of hoodlums (and of course they have to be Mexican, obviously), his good will towards his fellow man backfires. In that case, it wasn't too hard to predict that he was about to have a handful of angry hoodlums, but I like that the movie suggests that  things like that shouldn't be ignored. I'm reminded of the episode of Michael Moore's brilliant The Awful Truth, when they had a man lay down on the sidewalk and pretend to be dead and see who would actually stop and make sure he was okay. The results were not very promising, so it's nice to see someone in the movies setting a good example.",2003

8,"Well, was Morgan Freeman any more unusual as God than George Burns? This film sure was better than that bore, ""Oh, God"". I was totally engrossed and LMAO all the way through. Carrey was perfect as the out of sorts anchorman wannabe, and Aniston carried off her part as the frustrated girlfriend in her usual well played performance. I, for one, don't consider her to be either ugly or untalented. I think my favorite scene was when Carrey opened up the file cabinet thinking it could never hold his life history. See if you can spot the file in the cabinet that holds the events of his bathroom humor: I was rolling over this one. Well written and even better played out, this comedy will go down as one of this funnyman's best.",2004
8,"If you want a serious laugh pain, watch this movie, and the things Bruce inflicts on his fellow newscaster. The deleted scenes are priceless. I don't know why they didn't include them in the original movie. It can't be because of time, since the movie is only 101 minutes long. Morgan Freeman is a brilliant actor, who has been overlooked for too long. Jim Carrey needs meds!",2003
8,"As someone who lives near Buffalo, New York, this movie scored points with me before I even saw it, since the story is based here. There are even some bit parts with real-life news-TV anchor people from Buffalo..and, for once, it doesn't knock the area. Hallelujah!",2008
10,"How would you handle the most awesome responsibility in the universe? Asks, the 2003-classic 'Bruce Almighty'. Some films have a certain feel to them, and this is amongst those films.",2010
7,"Bruce Almighty is the story of Bruce Nolan, an average man who feels God is messing up his life. God confronts him and show Bruce the error of his ways. Of course, giving someone God's powers could take a turn for the worse. Bruce Almighty is a good comedy, Jim Carrey is good, as always Morgan Freeman is first-rate and seems right at home as God and the cast brings the plot together well. The jokes are almost always on target, although sometimes they resort a bit too much on Carrey's facial expressions. I liked the fact that the movie actually portrayed God, not only that but also as a black man. I thought this quite well, especially with the brilliant Freeman. There are some hilarious scenes, the opening cookie scene for instance, others miss the target slightly but still a good film. 6/7 out of 10",2008
3,"When I read the summary of the movie, something like what happens when a man gets powers of a God, and how he later learns that having supernatural powers requires giant responsibility and strength, I though that was clever and original concept. Casting was promising too, Carrey, Freeman, Aniston... How can movie with a good idea and good actors, not to mention costs of filming, can be bad? It can. Idea is good, but script and story itself is terrible. Bruce Nolan is, let's be honest, a pretty mediocre journalist, with not exactly great stories (like a story of a giant cookie, what a faux pas, and the Niagara report is complete fiasco!), he's a man with a job he completely DESERVES (he's not a good journalist, he's a comedian), considering his potentials, with a nice home, sugar sweet girlfriend, and OH HORROR!!!! Dog who is not house trained!!! Yes, as soon as Bruce, at the beginning of the movie starts addressing GOd in a ""God, why do you hate me!"" manner, average viewer must think: ""Why, what's wrong with your life, Bruce?"". Bruce is not, and definitely NOT the man with real problems in life. Most the troubles that happen to him are minor and not really worth of all that fuss he makes, and some of them are really only the result of his stupidity. Most people have really big problems, worth of attention, most people are more worth of attention that Bruce, who doesn't seem too human after all, doesn't look even realistic, too goofy and neurotic, but God still addresses to him. Why? Though Morgan Freeman looks nice as a God, I can't help but to ask what is he doing in this particularly bad movie. And what does Bruce do when God gives him his powers? God in this movie could as easily give his powers to a 5 year old kid and there hardly would be any difference. No, wait, a smart kid would probably use his God powers better than Bruce. What does Bruce do? Pulls the moon closer to earth to create romantic atmosphere, parts the red soup, lifts up a pretty woman's dress on the street, answers prayers via e-mail and make all of them come true!!!! No more, Bruce, please! What Bruce did could actually end the world, but in the movie, that doesn't happen, because this is ""nice, family, little movie"" and doesn't make any sense at all!!! Not a hint of sarcasm, of real humor, of wittiness, of some dirty humor at least!!! Nothing. Just Carrey playing silly, which is starting to look pathetic on middle aged actor. Aniston here is understated. She plays pale, undeveloped character of Bruce's girlfriend Grace, and stays completely forgettable in this movie. Nobody in the right mind would believe that this two have any chemistry at all between them. When Grace says prayer for Bruce it sounds not only lame and pathetic, but completely false. These two are not meant to be together. I would give three stars, but I doubt movie deserves a one. Bad script, lame dialogs, lack of real humor, wittiness and any sophistication, as well as undeveloped characters and understated Freeman's and Aniston's roles, total lack of boldness and sarcasm, it all makes movie hardly worth ***. But OK, there were few funny moments, and Freeman is always nice to see in any movie so, lets leave three stars.",2005
1,"First of all, Bruce Almighty is a poor shallow comedy. Everyone loves slapstick but this film purely plays on Jim Carrey's wellknown trademark.",2003
7,"""Bruce Almighty"" looks and sounds incredibly stupid, especially from the trailers. Nevertheless, I found in it a deeper message that actually made me like this film more. Bruce (Jim Carrey) is angry at God and is given divine powers by him to be God for a week to see if he can do a better job. Morgan Freeman plays a man symbolized here as God, and though it isn't his usual type of film or one of his best roles, he does excellent with what he is given to work with. Although crude at times, the film does have quite a few laughs, from Bruce parting his soup in half like the Red Sea and the customers' reactions to him, as well as Freeman's seemingly laid-back and wisecracking image of God. It is overly exaggerated at times, and there is some crude humor, but overall it manages to be somewhat funny. There is a decent supporting cast, such as Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Ann Walter, and Steve Carrell, which always helps. The end of the film proves to be very romantic and tear-jerking, and the message is clear, that we should do what God has called us to do and ""be the miracle."" The film is far from perfect, but still enjoyable, and far better than I and many people probably would have expected, especially if we see the deeper message of the film.",2008

1,I was excited to go see this film.  It had been a long time since I went to see a Jim Carrey movie and I was definitely up for a good comedy.  So why not go see Bruce Almighty? I loved the Cable Guy and Carrey's had a few other shining moments despite some of his recent films looking pretty bad. This film seemed to have potential...,2003
1,"This was, by far, the worst movie I have ever had the misfortune of paying to see.  Jim Carrey with God-like powers, and the best he can do is make a monkey come out of a dude's ass?  Give me a break.  There were no jokes to speak of, unless you think giving a man a speech impediment or creating natural disasters to report on are funny.  Even the cookie and milk scene felt tacked on, a last, desperate attempt to make at least one audience member chuckle.  It failed, miserably. Ha ha, you danced to a cheesy 80's tune that smacked of failed irony and blew up a fire hydrant, what a larf!! Oh, sorry, I meant Barf. I know Carrey is a funny guy, but this piece of crap should have been bagged long before it went to film.",2004
1,"Doubtless fans of the title actor will disagree, but I couldn't find any redeeming features in this film.

1,"If some studio head, or person who was ivolved with this film ever reads this, I must apologize for my harsh comments which will ensue. I know that it is very difficult and time consuming to make a movie, whether it's good or bad. It demands time, more money than I care to think about, and the combined efforts of hundreds of individuals. Yet despite all the effort that goes into the production of a film like this, so many films fall under the aforementioned bad category. Bruce Almighty only supports my statement. If one were to read any of my other comments, it would be immediatly apparent that none of them are positive. I don't like to think of myself as an overly cynical person though, rather, I only review movies which in my opinion were overrated. Bruce stands proudly in line with the best of them. It could have been funny, and in fact, some parts were, yet they were all shown in the previews, and so, the movie was entirely predictable by the time I saw it. Not that this would have really mattered. This film tries to blend comedy and drama which movies like Heaven Can Wait have done in the past, and it fails miserably. You don't care what happens to Bruce, or any of the other characters, so when it goes treacly, the hands on your watch begin to move all too slowly. I feel bad putting down Bruce, for it could have been something-yet it wasn't. In addition, it had terrible production value(look at all the streets-they are all on the backlot). I am really off put by movies which act like they are important, and aren''t, and this was one of them.",2003

Jim Carrey was PERFECT for the lead! Totally awesome.",2003

9,"I agree that the Brits seem to be able to produce well written shows that can make you laugh out loud one minute and then be tearing up at the sincere drama of the next minute. This is a unique and entertaining crime drama with good humor and great actors. I became a fan of Amanda Redman in spite of first seeing her in a terribly crap TV movie called ""Suspicion"". She was clearly working hard to make that script interesting and I knew an actress that determined must be good. Now that I'm seeing her in a decent show I am not in the least disappointed. She is great (and getting more beautiful with each year). She's completely believable as the tough policewoman in charge of this motley crew of men, and the guarded, reluctantly vulnerable woman sort of dating a younger man. The entire cast is superb. Alun Armstrong has never disappointed in anything I've ever seen him in and he is hysterical as the cop on multiple meds in this show. It's nice to see real looking people rather than bimbos & himbos. These are talented actors having a good time and creating something extremely entertaining.",2007
9,"For us Brits, it's always nice to see familiar faces back where they belong, and this show does that for both Dennis Waterman and James Bolam.

9,"I absolutely adore Touch of Frost, Midsummer Murders and Inspector Morse, but the thing I love about New Tricks is that it is contemporary, funny and still manages to be serious when it needs to be. True, it is a bit corny at times,my only criticism of the series, but it is sterling entertainment for those who want to relax in the evenings. Allun Armstrong is both touching and funny as Brian, a man of intellect and charm, but this is perhaps under-appreciated by his colleagues. James Bolam makes the most out of his character, and one of the main reasons I watch New Tricks in the first place. Jack Halford is seen as quiet and composed, yet there is a certain sadness to him that is quite appealing. Amanda Redman never disappoints in anything she's in, and she gives a thoroughly entertaining and sometimes serious portrayal of Sandra, and Dennis Waterman from The Sweeney and Minder delights with his vocals in the title song(which is quite catchy), and equally delights with his three-times-divorced, heavy-smoking character of Gerry Standing. The episodes allow the four stars to have fun, and the witty and fresh, though sometimes corny, script allows plenty of character development. Standout episodes are when Jack is slowly poisoned by a man played by Richard Briers, and Sandra finding out how and why her father died.(I felt sorry for her then)All in all, an entertaining and often funny series. 9/10 Bethany Cox.",2009
9,"Few series about cops - albeit in this case retired, but re-activated - and criminals are as original, thought-provoking and fun as New Tricks!

9,"This series just gets better and better. You cant pick who is the better actor, they are all first class. No stereotyping here, all believable, no suspension of reality required.. its just pure entertainment and the fastest hour on the TV. It remains to be seen how far they can extend the series using the same premise. This is quality viewing from the Brits, the way they do it best. Amanda Redman showed us what she was made of in "" At Home with the Braithwaites "" another show you cant wait to see the next episode ! She has an unconventional beauty that makes her irresistible to watch, at least to THIS viewer. The male part of the cast work so well together, as they should as they are all veterans of the screen.....the show is smooth, seamless, funny and with real non plastic people who do not look all the same unlike in police dramas from the US, which seem to run to a tired formula, tired dialogue.... and is it just me ....but in US dramas when actors leave through a door....why do they inevitably have to turn and say something ??",2007
9,My wife got me watching this as she is into Detective/Crime Drama and I must say I was very pleasantly surprised for several reasons. The use of actors who probably had their heyday twenty years ago was one and the stories are very well written. The show is classed as Drama but there is fun and games in there too.,2007
9,"Bizarre and fun, New Tricks doesn't take itself too seriously, which is why it doesn't get bogged down in the mire that so many American cop shows do. Nothing against American TV, it's produced some hilarious shows, (Arrested Development and Friends come immediately to mind). But this particular type of gentle comedy / drama can only be done by the Brits. Eccentric, charismatic characters, quirky situations and witty dialogue are the strong points. Erratic pace and stereotypical minor characters are the main weaknesses. I find the problems with this show can be overlooked because it's willing to laugh at itself. I think it's great. The actors are right at home and it's sharp and original. Go for it, watch it, why not.",2006

This show is one of many that I recommend, including Murphy's Law, Murder City, Life on Mars, MI-5, Dr. Who, Torchwood and Primeval. US shows like Numb3rs and NCIS may rival them, but we can learn a lot from the Brits. I've just ordered my second multi-region DVD player because the last four years of Tricks has not come out in the US. The good thing is the episodes are usually fuller and richer on the international DVDS. Come on BBC, give us some more good stuff.",2010

I personally think that ""New Tricks"" is not only more entertaining but it leaves you with a feeling sad that it is over.

However, I appreciate it for its light touch and its ability to use British women actors ""of a certain age"". British TV and movies make good use of their talent pool of women over 40. If Hollywood needs a mature woman actor, they usually take a gorgeous twenty-something and make her spend two hours in the make-up trailer prior to shooting. Think Charlize Theron in ""Monster"". In ""New Tricks"" we have seen some splendid faces from the past, most of whom have been making a steady living in British theater and TV since their glory days on the screen.

8,"I must say that when I first approached this TV series I was kind of skeptic. I thought that it would be based on the predictable jokes on retired cops and on aged people in general. I was quite surprised to see instead that the jokes are funny and work well thanks to the 4 main characters, each one with a defined personality. Besides this the plots are well made and the murderer is never obvious. Plus,the stories are credible and are not exaggeratedly far from reality. An interesting feature of the ""New Tricks"" is that each character has some dramatic event or problem left behind that arises now and then in the story, which contributes to give more definition to the personality and it also represents a constant present during the entire series. To wrap it up I would say unexpectedly original.",2014
9,"Love the show in that each show has a very definitive set of elements one can look forward too. I found this show while roaming through HULU. The good part is I get to see one show after the other and so far love the shows that are available Season 1 and 2. Amanda Redman is very good as she navigates and works through the old and the new police work ethics. along with the fact that she has to manage the issues of her personal life along with waking up everyday to handle the trickiness of her professional life, since non of her superiors appreciates what she does as she goes about solving crimes that no one else has or will solve. The guys are great and they have very good story lines and they seem to use the past to build the future solutions using DNA and more. Great show to watch",2013
10,"We consider this one of our all-time favorites, a top-rated series. The main cast – Dennis Waterman, Alan Armstrong, James Bolam, Amanda Redman and Susan Jameson were so much fun to watch. The initial investigations got to take a backseat to the interaction of the characters. The banter among them had us cracking up. I especially remember Alan Armstrong on his bike chasing a girl and riding the bike down some steps. The landing was hilarious. We were disappointed when the original cast started to leave. Things are never the same with different characters. In all fairness, I don't believe that they developed Denis Lawson or Nicholas Lyndhurst characters the way that they should have. They were not able to bring the same light-heartiness to the series and it faltered. It seemed that perhaps the writers/producers were getting away from this. I got the impression that especially Denis Lawson was at a loss as to what to do with his character. He might not have the capability of bringing off humor. I feel that Nicholas Lyndhurst was too much of a serious actor to make an attempt at humor. Besides these things, as with all series, the stories were getting a bit weak. It would have been interesting to see if the original cast could have brought those weak scripts to life. But all in all it is a series that we highly recommend.",2017

I wouldn't miss it for any reason.I just savor every moment of this wonderful series about a group of ""old"" British detectives who constantly runs into trouble with fine humor and everlastingly rocks ""the establishment"" within the police force. Quirky, eccentric and not adverse to bursting the bubbles of his snobby and stiff bosses, they're really copper's copper (without the helmet) and always leads us through such an entertaining series of plot twists and turns, it's really quite irresistible.

This series will make you laugh, feel a very deep compassion for the characters, want to make you scream in rage, make you want to scream with happiness, and yes, even cry. Yeah. I cried a couple times. And the plot, oh yes, the plot. It's one of the best I've ever seen. Some might say it's too dark, I disagree, it's just honest. It explains that what's gone is gone, and we can't bring it back, people die for a reason, people die for no reason, life isn't fair, you only get what you give, all good things come to an end and we can only make the best of what we're given. Now the Characters, from Edward to Envy, Winry to Hughes, Scar to Rose, Riza to Roy, all characters have something special about them, and it will make you feel a deep compassion for them, weather it's Edward or Roy. Each character is developed and deep to it's full extent. The music is great, the Japanese voice actors are amazing, and the English Dub is one of the best I've seen.

9,"This anime is about two gifted brothers who are intelligent, kind and ambitious. They live in a world where Alchemy, and subsequently Alchemist, is the law of the world (vs. science in ours). With alchemy, one can do wonders... repair broken items....change physical properties of a matter...etc. However, alchemy is bound to one rule....one cant take (or make) a thing without giving something in return. With this simple rule, the two brothers go in a maze of exciting adventures, meeting wonderful characters and even sometimes, respectable enemies. The anime is 51 episodes long, which might seem a little too long initially, yet fortunately...each and every episode will tie you to your seat and make you crave for more. Story line is good, a mix of brotherhood, friendship, love, humanity and (like any other anime) the effect of war on people, not to forget the hilarious moments this anime is mined with. Character development is excellent. Drawing is top notch and music is entertaining. Unfortunately, this anime is not concluded after 51 episodes.

As the story gradually unfolds, you are drawn ever deeper into a believable alternative world where magic replaces science and its practitioners (Alchemists) are held in high esteem. Yet, few are what they seem and you cannot trust anybody. The good are, in fact, capable of deeds of great evil, and the bad are often doing what they do for good reasons. And just when you think you're getting a handle on it, something comes along that shocks you in such a way you are left thinking about it for days to come. Whilst there are obviously anime elements (the look, fighting segments) the story and, above all, the willingness to shock the audience by hurting and killing characters we have come to know and admire, make Fullmetal Alchemist well worth your time. Of course, you will have to invest a lot of time - 51 half hour episodes and a movie means 26 hours or so of viewing. But it is time well worth spending.",2007
10,"It has been 2 weeks since I have finished this series and the ending is still lingering with me. I heard that this was an excellent series from a friend so I decided to check it out myself. Well, all I can say is that FMA has exceeded all my expectations and have become my favorite anime in recent years. It has actually surpassed my other favorites including Neon Genesis, Cowboy Bebop, Berserk, Escaflowne, GTO, and even Gungrave which is second on my list. The writer and director of this series has such a wonderful imagination. I just don't know how they come up w/ these ideas. The voice acting (Japanese), writing, animation, music, and action is awesome. I just can't praise FMA enough. This is definitely a journey worth taking for all those looking for a good anime.",2005

10,"When I heard of ""Full Metal Alchemist"" i didn't know what to expect! But only after watching the first episode I knew this series was special! From the start it drew me in and took me on a journey in to incredible adventures! It is the story that is truly amazing! At first the story is quite simple,but after a couple of episodes you will get some twists and turns you won't see coming! They managed to dazzle and surprise you almost every episode! Once you start watching ""Full Metal Alchemist"" you will not stop! The anime successfully mixed different genres (sciencefiction,drama,action,horror and comedy)! Also FMA throws in some serious subjects for us to think about and be entertained at the same time! But what really makes this anime works are the characters! A lot of attention is paid to them! The good guys,the villains all have their good qualities and bad qualities! Evil characters don't have to be pure evil! And the good characters also make mistakes! In that sense most of the characters are very similar to us humans and therefore are very appealing! This anime sure will make an impact on you on different levels! A MUST SEE!",2007
10,"Fullmetal Alchemist (Or to the purists Hagaren no Renkinjutsushi (Not sure I spelt it right)) Has become one of the most popular animes in both America and Japan. The story revolves around Edward and Alphonse Elric who attempted to bring their mother back from death by attempting human transmutation. But they paid a hefty price. Edward lost his left leg and Alphonse lost his entire body. Edward then sacrificed his right arm to seal Alphonse's soul into a suit of armor. The Elric brothers now seek the legendary Philosopher's Stone (Not the Harry Potter one, lol) to restore their bodies. However there are others out to get the stone for their own purposes. In my opinion this may actually be the best anime around. Sadly it's only 51 episodes :(. But it's worth every second to watch this show.",2006

10,"This anime first came out in English when I was a freshman in high school. I was a real anime geek and would watch whatever would come on Adult swim, but there are certain shows, books, or movies that can change a person's life because of the characters. That's what Full Metal Alchemist was to me. The characters were so well written, each with a past that was unique. This show had me on my seat routing for the two characters Edward and Alphonse. They made the personalities of the characters into someone that people could relate to. They even made the ""Bad guys"" the homunculus into people that you, in the end, felt kind of sorry for (with the exception of Envy, he can burn for all I care) Also, may I just say that normally I don't like English dubbed anime, but the dubbers of this anime did such a fantastic job and put all the right emotions in to all the right places and they did an extraordinary job with each of the characters. Especially Vic Mignogia with Ed, my hats off to that man, he is an awesome actor! This anime actually, as cheesy and lame as it sounds, helped me a lot with my own personal life. There's one phrase that Edward says, that stands out to me, and that's ""You've got a good strong pair of legs on you, it's time to get up and use them"" It made me think a lot about how people just sit on their butt and dream, but if you don't take action, then those dreams and things that you want will never become attainable.",2006
5,"Well, I can understand why anime fans love this series, but personally, it contains a lot of the stuff I personally *don't* like about anime. My main gripe is with the writing for some of the story lines. I do like the overarching series themes about equivalency, man's role in the world, and more specifically the adult themes of government corruption. However, I felt that the story lines to support these themes were poorly written, as if they were written by a child for a mature audience. For example, in that episode where there's an obvious rift btw Edward and Al, the reason for the tension is completely ludicrous. The method used for this is immature and clichéd, and is the type of plot vehicle used in really bad Jerry Bruckheimer action films to form a skeleton of story on which to base action scenes around. The end of the series has less of this type of trash writing, but it's quite a lot of garbage to wade through in order to get to a decent end.",2011
10,"When I first started viewing anime, I was at the age where anything action-packed was likely to impress. I regarded the classic DBZ and Gundam Wing to be the best anime ever made and quite frankly I did not agree with the later charts which placed Fullmetal Alchemist above all others. The name said nothing to me but the fact it constantly received comments of high regard persuaded me to watch it...It did not take more than the first episode to bring the realization that this was something of higher class. A superbly polished and well-built story which takes the viewer away from traditional level-up characters and fillers, combined with some of the best characters ever drawn make Fullmetak Alchemist a totem of originality. Whoever said anime are for kids has not been exposed yet to the sheer genius of this series. At the end of the viewing, the only regret for anyone will have been that only 51 episodes were committed to the story (and there is not one which can be called disposable). Fullmetal Alchemist sets a standard of anime which will probably stay unsurpassed for years to come.",2008

9,"This is probably the most shocking movie experience I've ever had, not only because of the emotional impact, but because this is truly a moral-horror movie that slapped me in the face.",2009
9,"Tough. Once again Lars von Trier tortures the audience (as he did previously on Dancer in the Dark) by upraising the darkest side of the human being. From the beginning you know that things can only get worse, but I doubt that one can figure out neither what's to come nor the powerful conclusion. Nicole Kidman's interpretation is perfect - intense, poignant, passionate, you name it. She is fantastic and so is the small cast locked inside Dogville's scenario (a wonderful creation - I wonder how something so simple can bring such a strong effect). Again, the entire cast is fantastic and for that goes an extra credit for Lars von Trier. His capability of pushing actors to the limit and extracting painful emotions from them creates a heavy atmosphere, full of tension and, at the same time, so familiar. It is not that Dogville represents the essence of our communities, but it exposes some aspects of our lives that we prefer to hide under the carpet.",2005

The end is so powerful, I was speechless. That's one of the best movies I have seen in a long, long, long, long time. I don't agree with the Anti-American comments I read here in some of the comments. Human emotions are all the same all over the world and this movie could have played in any country. Anyway, go watch this movie it's soooo worth it.",2004
9,"I watched this film after much of the controversy about it at Cannes had passed. The buzz in the U.S. press was that the film was slanted and reflected Lars Von Trier's ignorance of American society. Such arguments are specious on their face--there are examples of great literature and film making where the creator never set foot in the setting, as any reader of Shakespeare well knows. So discounting the self-appointed guardians of America, what exactly is this film about, what are the film's merits and why does it evoke such strong feelings from its audience, especially American ones? What Von Trier has done is take several American icons: the gangster, the small town, the woman in distress, the ideal of the common person, the local sage and the wise elder gentleman doctor, and has turned them on their head to create a timeless play about human motivation, greed and the corrupting influence of power. The people of Dogville are on the surface simple and decent people. Grace's arrival and her helplessness is the catalyst that, step by step, tempts the people of Dogville to inflict upon her greater and greater humiliations to feed their now unrestrained desires. So complete is her humiliation that the twist at the end leaves the viewer very little sympathy for the fate of Dogville's citizens. It is a powerful message and the judgment of the characters is one that takes no prisoners. That there are more than a few examples of this behavior in contemporary American society (and in the American past) and that it confronts these issues directly is the reason for the controversy surrounding it and--apart from the brilliant acting, especially by Ms. Kidman and Paul Bettany--what makes it great art. Von Trier has made a movie that is part of the quintessential American proletarian artistic tradition and its setting in 1930s America is part of the film's genius. That he is not an American and that this movie did not originate in Hollywood should give us all pause. There is a scene in which Grace confronts the people of Dogville with a critique of their bad behavior. Their response is to either deny the truth of what she has said or to blame Grace herself for tempting them. This movie, without being preachy or dogmatic, attempts to provide its own critique and received much the same reaction as the movie's protagonist. I would not be surprised if this was Von Trier's original intent. Dogville is a disturbing and powerful film.",2004
10,"On the Great Depression, the fragile and beautiful Grace (Nicole Kidman) arrives in Dogville, a small town in Colorado, escaping from the mob. Tom Henson (Paul Bettany), a young local man, welcomes and introduces her to the distrustful community. They decide to vote whether she could stay with them or not. After a brief meeting, they decide to lodge her for fourteen days, when they could judge her behavior and come up to a final decision. Meanwhile, she should perform some small jobs for them in a sort of retribution, receiving a symbolic payment. Later, the police come to the town with some pictures of her, informing she was a missing person. The vulnerable Grace becomes a slave of the community, being used by the locals in the most sordid and cravenly way. The conclusion of the story is spectacular. ",2004

So slow that I would occasionally flip through a book I was reading at the time until something of interest caught my attention and I was watching again.

9,"When I went into the movie theater to see this film I didn't really know what I was getting myself into. All I knew was that ""Dogville"" had Nicole Kidman in it- an actress I have always liked- and Lars von Trier, a director I have always respected. I was quickly surprised by what the film was. Set entirely on a stage/sound stage I couldn't believe my eyes. As a theatre actor it was exciting to see how this all was going to work out. Dogville did not disappoint. Lars von Trier clearly creates a town that may seen ordinary and odd into masterful. Nicole Kidman was excellent and the supporting cast was flawless. It was great to see Lauren Bacall and I enjoyed her performance. When I first saw Paul Beattany in the film all I could think of was the awful film ""A Knight's Tale"" that he is also in. However he proved me wrong in his well developed character. Patricia Clarkson was great in her role as Vera, she is a stunning actress. If she keeps getting these great roles an Oscar is sure to be in her future. The film on the whole is wonderful. My only complaint was the length. Around the 2 hour mark I was getting kind of antsy, but the film brought me back to finish the roller coaster ride that the film gave. Truly an original. Go see it.",2005
10,"Yesterday I saw Dogville after almost one year of waiting its release in Mexico. I didn't know anything about the movie besides the basic plotline: a fugitive from justice seeks refugee in a small town that takes advantage of her. I knew that it was shot in a stage and that it was being criticized for being anti american. To my surprise and being a big admirer of both, Von Trier and Kidman, Dogville exceeded all my expectations. The movie is about major issues and throughout its exciting imagery, raw performances and sharp script, Dogville digs deeper than what its detractors are saying about it. It is not, in no way, an anti american film. ***WARNING. POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD*** My interpretation is that it is metaphor on Jesus, as a female character, an arrogant rebel that denies her own father (because she doesn't understand his and thus, her power) and doesn't want to be her daughter.",2003
9,"First of all, I am surprised that 'Dogville' is not on IMDb'S top 250: it is one of my favorites and one of the most original movies I already have watched in my life.Many people doesn't like the lack of scenarios,special effects and soundtrack, but all of these things are secondary in Dogville: the high point to pay attention here, is the story and the message it is trying to show you: That power can corrupt and even people who seems to be nice, can exploit and use other people for their own selfish uses. Full of metaphors,I already heard some people saying that Dogville can be a metaphor of God/Christ and Human race, and many of the parallels can really fit in the story. ",2006
1,"I really did not like this movie. I have followed Lars von Triers career for a long time, and have seen all his movies, and the only one i really enjoyed was RIKET (The Kingdom) and Breaking the Waves. What annoyed me about Dogville was a lot of things: The main thing is that it never really gets to me, i don`t feel anything while I see it. And Von Trier himself once said: ""Film er følelser"" or ""Films are feelings."" Dogville is surprisingly cold and it leaves a great distance between me and the characters. Another thing is the experiment in form. For those who havent seen it: It all takes place in the studio. The actors are in costume, but instead of streets, houses and trees and bushes there are markings on the floor that the actors were forced to relate to. The move through invisible doors, and you hear an invisible dog barking. Far away form his DOGME film THE IDIOT. It`s all very neat, but it all becomes very artificial. Which off course is why he did it. It all looks like a theatrical play that is being filmed, which is a thing i really hate. The story is ok, I was never really bored during this 3-hour movie, and the main reason for that is the wonderful actors. But if you come from Scandinavia you will find the story no more advanced than a Finnish tv-drama, filled with really evil people pretending to be nice, and the problems in small towns. Finnish tv-drama is an expression in these countries, and a genre Von Triers knows a lot about. But this kind of story demands an intimacy with the characters that you don`t get in Dogville. The theatrical appearance of the film creates a huge distance to the whole story, and the film falls between two chairs. It never moves or inspires. It just tells a long, long story, that frankly is not very believable, specially the ending, when we find out who Nicole Kidmans characters is, and she orders the whole village to be executed. A scene that never would have worked if Von Trier had uses film effects in stead of theatrical effects. It would have been to violent, and the N. Kidman character would have been even more difficult to swallow. The last thing that annoyed me during the entire film is John Hurts voice-over. He has a fantastic voice and presence in the film, but I hate it when a voice-over is telling me what I`m looking at. ""Now you`re seeing this, and now you`re seeing that!"" It is overstated the whole way through and it creates even more distance. All in all, a HUGE disappointment. Lars Von Triers experiment with the form of cinema fails big time. And I really feel a lot of people like this film just because it is weird and strange, and experimental. And I really feel sorry for the actors, see DOGVILLE CONFESSIONS and find out why. That doesn`t really matter, Hitchcock was terrible to his actors too. But go see it if you get the chance, find out what you think, I would love to discuss it, and as I said; the actors really save this movie from total failure.",2003

1,"I agree with those who say this film is a disappointment. Funny, I watched this the same day I watched ""Tree of Life."" Within 5 minutes of Tree I knew I would love it, and I did. Within 5 minutes I knew I would hate this film, and I did. But not for the story, since I hadn't seen much yet, but for the, as the French say, mise en scène. It was a theater piece, but if I want to see a theater piece, I can go to the theater. But, unfortunately, it got worse. The acting was too theatrical except perhaps from Kidman. The story was numbing in its non development. First the town people help her, then they demand more for some nonsensical reason (it costs double to protect her), then Tom's solution is absurd. Then they turn to sadistic tortures, physical and mental, but it's not really punishment. Unbelievable for a film that takes 3 hours to tell. And of course the cruel finale that shocked many. Some have said that this could be an anti-Jewish film. Could be, but I see it more as a modern version of Sodom and Gomorrah. Grace is Abraham and at first wants to save the town, before the revealing light of the moon convinces her to have it destroyed. Whatever, this film is not worth the trouble thinking over long. It is not, clearly, a brain teaser like Mulholland Dr or Tree of Life. It is pseudo intellectual at its finest, like other films by this director, like the equally mediocre Melancholia. Final note, while watching this I didn't think it was especially anti- American, but once the end credits started rolling, it was a shock to hear Young Americans and to see images of poor Americans. Then, and only then, I thought that this piece is anti-American, and I believe it is. The song itself is anti-Americana at its best. Then I thought that the cheap set might reflect the idea that American life is seen as cheap and artificial, compared to the real, authentic European life. In any case, I can't recommend this film. It is over touted like most, if not all, of von Trier's films.",2012

The first episode generally starts a clip show with a Tyra-logue about modeling. How far she made me, how she struggled, how she is(or was, depending on who you favor) #1. Then we go through 30-something young girls who get flown in to some city for an in-person interview of sorts so Tyra can get a glimpse of their TV personalities and hear sob stories. The Tyra makes a series of cuts to get down to the top 10, 12, 13, or 14 contestants.",2007

How many little girls (and boys) grew up seeing images of beautiful people in magazines and on TV and wanted to be just like them when they grew up. Hell many of us still do that now. ANTM lets you live out this dream and see what it really takes to be a supermodel.

A lot of the past winners have looked semi decent but are horribly cruel and starting trouble for the other girls. I see Tyra less involved with the girls in every season. About the only thing worth watching Top Model for is Mr. Jay Manuel. Recently, Tyra had a contestant who was a pre-op transsexual. I felt that she should have done more to encourage her. It was obvious that she had insecurities about her original anatomy showing through her feminine look. Tyra should have given her tips or perhaps she could have sent resident Trannie Ms. Jay to help the girl out. Instead, the contestant was met with harsh criticism and not enough positive criticism. It's a shame because I truly enjoyed the first 3 seasons. There's a reason why Project Runway has all 4 seasons out on DVD and Top Model only has 1 season on DVD. It's called taste.

I do not buy magazines anymore because they are one sided on this matter. We would really love the show to consider women of all sizes. Thank you.",2007
7,"I mean let's face it, all you have to do in modelling is pose for photos. The judging is so over the top with it's criticism. The show however is entertaining, especially with Tyra Banks, Nigel Barker, J Alexander and the supermodel herself Twiggy. I've watched season 5, 6, 7 and in the middle of season 8. It looks like American Idol gone sexy but I'm a guy and I only watch it because of the hot girls posing in their bikinis! The show can be quite boring, when it comes to judging, Tyra tends to go on and on and it's really off-putting. Anyway would I recommend it? Yes, Would I recommend it to women wanting to go into the modelling business? No.",2007

I'm really lost, no Pop, no swag and lackluster story lines. 😔 The challenges aren't fresh and the struggle to be inclusive is cliché. When you leave at the Top you don't want a team that could use a makeover. Hurry and press redo.",2017
10,This is the best show ever no matter what you say!I have been watching this show since cycle 1.This show is never boring its wonderful how you see peoples dream come true of being a model.Tyra is trying her best to help young women not be ashamed of their bodies and make them believe that they are beautiful in their own way and that you don't have to feel beautiful by being anorexic.And just as Tyra says on the Tyra show so what if your curvy so what if you have a big round booty so what if you have a big nose so what if your not as beautiful as the people in magazines you are beautiful to her.SO WHAT...............................,2007

Insight into that shall be revealed as well. Such sage wisdom ye shall not find in other reviews. Read on.",2004
10,"Tradition be damned! I HATED the Mary Martin, Sandy Duncan, Cathy Rigby productions of Peter Pan! There, I've said it. I realize I'm in the minority on this point, but I have NEVER been able to accept the idea of some actress dressing up in silly green tights, singing equally silly songs, while pretending to be a prepubescent boy pretending to fly on silly piano wires. I fully admit that it's a pet peeve of mine and not meant to denigrate those who have delighted in this tradition. As a long time lover of the J.M. Barrie stories and play, all I can say is that P.J. Hogan's ""Peter Pan"" is the Pan movie I have waited my entire life for. It is simply a glorious retelling of the J.M. Barrie tale. After Spielberg's dreadful 1991 abortion, ""Hook"" I was convinced that the story had been buried forever as far as big budget film-making was concerned. I thought all there would be was the 1953 Disney animated film, which unfortunately is more Disney than Barrie or worse, that I was condemned to a lifetime of endless reruns of Mary Martin and Cyril Ritchard. Boy, was I wrong. Taking its visual cue from the wondrous illustrations of Maxfield Parrish, Edmund Dulac, N.C. Wyeth and Arthur Rackham, this new film recreates the storybook Never Land on a level that has never been achieved before, nor will ever be again.",2004
10,"When I was very young, the first version of Peter Pan I saw was the annual televised production of the Broadway Musical starring Mary Martin. It was delightful in its own limited way because after all, when Mary as Peter took to the skies you could definitely see the wires. Not to mention that Peter's shadow looked suspiciously like female hosiery sewn together in the shape of a boy. Some years later, when it was first released on video, I finally was able to enjoy the animated Disney version of J.M. Barrie's classic story. The songs, the animation, the characters were all first rate. Later, I caught a special showing of the Broadway Peter Pan again, this time with Cathy Rigby filling the shoes of Mary Martin. She was full of spunk and energy, and certainly had the physical frame for the role but you could still see the wires. Then Stephen Spielberg tried his hand at it, bringing us Robin Williams as a grown up Peter Pan, Dustin Hoffman as Captain Hook and even Julia Roberts as Tinkerbelle. Spielberg called his film Hook, and it's the first time that character was ever given star billing. I like Julia Roberts, but the beam of light used for Tinkerbelle in the Broadway production gave a better performance. Of course, being a Spielberg film you couldn't see the wires, but surprisingly Spielberg somehow forgot to make his film either interesting or magical. I'd rather have had the magic and seen the wires. The question is, just how many versions of the story does one need? Please don't despair, as it turns out, the latest may just be the greatest of them all.",2004
10,"From the moment when I saw the first preview for this movie in the theaters, I was completely captivated. I've always loved the story of Peter Pan; I grew up watching the Disney and Mary Martin versions, and always thought the story to be one of undeniable power and beauty. When the film was released, I went to see it with my family, and was overwhelmed. I laughed, gasped, and cried, and the movie had my complete and enthralled attention from the opening notes of James Newton Howard's equally magical score through the end credits.",2004
10,"This movie is, in a word, BRILLIANT. I've always been a fan of Peter Pan, and LOVED the Disney and Mary Martin versions we all grew up on, but this film is 100000x better than any other version! This is THE definitive Peter Pan. I can't say enough about it! This has quickly become my favorite film of all time. It's hard for me to explain why, but, NO movie has touched my heart like this before, ever. It's dark, funny, SEXY, intelligent, and a bit scary; just like the original novel.",2004

7,"Remember Betty Bronson and Ernest Torrence as both Peter Pan and Captain Hook respectively?  Doubt it.  That is because to even my amazement, the last time the true story of Peter Pan was done in a live action format was in 1924 starring the two above mentioned actors that while appearing in over 80 films collectively, we probably wouldn't recognize them if they walked down the street with name tags on their shirts.",2004
7,"The film centers about Peter Pan (Jeremy Sumpter), Tink (Ludivine Sagnier), Wendy (Raquel Evan-Wood) and brothers who escape from parents' home (Jason Isaacs and Olivia Williams) and they are going to Neverland . They will take on captain Hook ( Jason Isaacs) and pirates henchmen . The argument is similar to Walt Disney's classic , it's alike the cartoon had been made reality. The starring couple as Jeremy Sumpter and Raquel Wood are top notch and Jason Isaacs, sometimes good (the dad) and other bad (Hook) is excellent . Cinematography by Donald McAlpine and James Newton Howard musical score are breathtaking and spellbound . Industrial light magic (ILM , George Lucas production) special effects are awesome and spectacular . Sets are astounding and gorgeous . The picture mingles adventures, action, humor ,tongue in cheek , fantasy and a lot of entertainment . Since the beginning until the end the amusing is interminable .

10,There's only one word for this film: AWESOME.,2006
10,"I loved this movie. It is one of the best movies I've ever seen. The acting from both Peter and Wendy was great, not to mention Jason Isaacs as Captain Hook. Jason Isaacs is one of my favorite actors, and this movie just proved why. He was able to play a kind and lovable Mr. Darling, then turn around and play the fearsome James Hook. There were several moments in this film that just hit home. It gave me shivers when everyone was chanting ""I do believe in fairies."" You can't watch that scene and not be touched. It just lifts you into the air with joy and I couldn't help grinning. Another beautiful scene is the fairy dance. It is so pure and sweet. I must touch again on the brilliance of Jason Isaacs. Never before have I seen a character who is so evil, yet, in some scenes, likable. The portrayal of the character was amazing. I recommend that everyone see this movie. It will be enjoyed by adults, children, boys and girls. Girls will especially enjoy seeing young Wendy sword fighting instead of letting Peter have all the fun. This is an amazing movie that everyone should see.",2005
10,"Peter Pan was one of four family holiday flicks that came out at the Christmas season of 2003, along with Elf, Cat in the Hat, and Cheaper by the Dozen. Peter Pan took viewers on a magical adventure to Neverland and back with the three Darling children, portrayed beautifully by Rachel Hurd-Wood, Harry Newell, and Freddie Popplewell.",2005
9,"Having grown up with Mary Martin's television performances of Peter Pan, I never imagined the character portrayed by anyone other than a middle aged woman. With Jeremy Sumpter's agile and gender correct performance, Peter Pan becomes the screen's most attractive youth who won't grow up with adolescent bravado and impish cuteness. An all-round exceptional cast of actors whose credits rarely include children's stories, this film is a delight, and truly aimed at the young as well as older audiences who might accompany them.",2005

10,"The mixed reviews for P.J. Hogan's 2003 hit ""Peter Pan"" leave you wondering if adults should be permitted to give a bad rating to a children's film. The vast majority of the reviews were positive ones, as the reviewers either liked the film themselves, or were convinced that it would be very entertaining viewing for children. The negative reviews came from adult critics who found little ""personal"" enjoyment and never really bothered about the children factor.",2006
6,"Having seen the movie a few hours ago and the initial joy wearing off, this movie still leaves a pleasant taste in your mouth. This is Peter Pan as it should have been done years ago (although quite possibly couldn't have, effects wise). The movie is highly stylised, which works brilliantly, and very rarely has any cringe-worthy moments.",2003

6,"I haven't read the comments of others, so I'm not sure why it's rated so low. This is a pretty decent yarn with some good action and suspense in it. The story is almost believable. A drug dealer is detained by the Police and offers $100 million to anyone who can spring him. The offer is taken up by several people and the Los Angeles Police Department finds itself outgunned. Their only hope is the newly formed SWAT team, headed by Samuel L. Jackson. The whole SWAT thing is new and no one likes it. While, today, many people still don't like the idea of SWAT teams, they are now a part of the law enforcement landscape. It's too ""Military"" for most people. The film shows the build up and some of the training of the SWAT team, and their duel with the bad guys in the end. It kept my attention and I found it entertaining. And isn't that what the industry is all about? I gave it a 7.",2004
6,"'S.W.A.T.' is a movie that does nothing more than deliver. It promises nice action scenes and gives us some. They look pretty good, so I guess in that way I can recommend the movie. The story is, of course, about S.W.A.T., a respected part of the LAPD. We follow a team with leader Hondo (Samuel L. Jackson), Jim Street (Colin Farrell), Sanchez (Michelle Rodriguez), Deke (rapper LL Cool J), Boxer (Brian Van Holt) and T.J. (Josh Charles). They have to deal with a criminal named Alex Montel (Olivier Martinez) who offers 100 million dollars to the people who will help him escape from jail.",2004
7,"S.W.A.T. is a nothing more and nothing less than what you expect from it - god action film, the script is very predictable and full of clichees, but it has enough logic and good sense to avoid the ridicule. Acting is average good, effects are average good, and directing is average good - so what you get is an average good action film. Get your popcorn, biers as well if you are at home, sit back and relax. Nothing more, nor less 7 out of 10 on my personal scale.",2004
10,"I seriously had so much fun watching this. Is it clichéd yes? Is it stupid? No. First off, the performances are great. Sam Jackson is still a badass. Colin Farrel is very cool. LL Cool J does a decent job. Also Jeremy Renner was awesome.",2011
6,"People may dismiss S.W.A.T. as one of those films that stands there on its own as pure entertainment for the average film going Joe and overall, they'd be right to do so. You don't need me or anyone else to tell you that this film is indeed a bit of light-hearted fun that most people can enjoy but what struck me was that more popular 'fun' films such as Snakes on a Plane and Pirates of the Caribbean didn't do as much for me as S.W.A.T. did and this makes me think that S.W.A.T. is a tad underrated, albeit as a popcorn fest.",2007
5,"It's difficult to review action movies fairly.

So, we'll add that Spanish woman alongside the singer with a tough stomach. What a terrific setup!",2003
2,"I expected a straightforward format movie. No extreme expectations, even though Jackson and especially Farrell have a fair track record. Yet it still managed to be really disappointing. Everything about this flick is just not enough to make the viewer shift in his seat. (Well maybe your girlfriend, I've heard Farrell is eye-candy in this one.) The storyline is so utterly predictable, it never requires more than a few braincells to know what's coming next. The acting is tame, bored, everybody just seems to want to go home and have a beer instead. Without this being a spoiler, if I say: eager having-to-prove-themselves-worthy S.W.A.T members, a wary chief, a (former) colleague, turning rogue, wealthy rich absolute stereotype bad guy arrested early on in the movie and you and maybe even your pet hamster easily can join up the dots.

Farrell does well enough with his role as does Jackson but they both look like they are ""acting"" the part. I know that is what they are really doing but as an actor they have failed to instill the belief in the audience that they are in fact members of an elite SWAT team. It's not all their fault though as the writers and director don not give them much of a chance to really bring that belief across. ",2007
10,i thought that this movie was awesome. and of course you have Collin Ferrell's bad a** attitude and all the shooting of swat. and in the movie Colin's partner is way more bada** than he is i guess i would say Ferrel plays kind of a nerd in this.but his partner is tattooed ears pierced and just awesome in this a great movie i would suggest to rent it a good plot good writing humor but at the same time drama but a good solid movie. i do like the whole swat concept and it captures if you were in a swat officers shoes than this is pretty much what it would feel like to be rushed under pressure nervous scared get the job done i am telling you to get it it is a terrific movie,2006
7,"As cop movies go, this one isn't bad at all. It gives some nice background information about the characters without overdoing it, and the plot is satisfying if not awfully surprising. My main quibble is that hottie girl-jock Michelle Rodriguez didn't get enough screen time. It's nice to see she made the SWAT team, though, and we can always hope she'll have a bigger part in the sequels. On the other hand, Colin Farrel, who evidently has a modest following among female moviegoers, gets plenty of screen time. Something for everybody.",2003

1,"This is just another example of Hollywood tiring to turn a buck at the expense of a great show or movie. lets see since the 90's began they have killed so many classics either by cheesy remakes with the same title or else knowing they were really bad movies, tried to play them off with different titles. even most of the sequels have been so bad that they barley worth mentioning let alone seeing. I am wondering why Steve Forest lowered him self to even be in this movie not to mention Trebeck, are there careers in that much Jeopardy that they are reaching for straws? This movie had a lot of hype that died at the door to the theater, it relied on using big names that tried to work with a poor script that relied on a lot of action and no story. If you want to see SWAT then get the original series, it may be outdated and a bit slow by 21st century standards but it is a better value then this attempt at being a movie, I hope that they do not add insult to this by even thinking of making a sequel. If they do I hope the real LA SWAT forces sign a petition banning it being filmed before they get a real bad image, worse then they still have since the LA riots. Of course a sequel could set of another set of riots of film goers just getting fed up with horrible movies.",2005

This movie was described be in depth self-interest of modern people. Also the scene of actions had very real and hard.Probably it becomes addicted to first watcher. Actor's performances were charming. Conclusion was very surprised me. And I can't estimate the conclusion. I think this movie is very epoch-making! So I think many people support think movie. As a matter of course,this movie was received many awards. So I recommend this movie!!",2009
8,"Some people would tell you that X2 is more conventional and mainstream than the first movie and to that I can only say: What a load of rubbish! Not only does X2 continue in the style set by the first film but it also improves on it greatly. This is achieved by adding more characters, making a deeper story and making the ever expanding universe even more chaotic so as better to capture the essence of the comic book. Two thumbs way up! The story picks up after the events of the first film in a way that pleases the viewers of the first film and is satisfactory to new viewers. The story is still well written and the pacing has improved a lot from the first film. There are no real slow points during the movie and the director takes special care to cram many of the scenes with breath taking visual effects so the audience will never lose interest. The dialog is once again both very sharp and witty and intelligent and allows for adequate character development. The character development is something some people have seen fit to criticize as they claim there isn't enough of it and except for only two characters I whole heartedly disagree. The character development of the main characters happened pretty much in the first film and therefore it is only necessary to add a bit more depth to the characters instead of repeating the character development from the first film. I did feel, however, that the film seemed somewhat rushed at times and that is a shame as it definitely had potential to be a 2½ hour film.",2005

Brian Singer himself must've been sweating adamantium bullets, not only being held under the gun by the studio to lead their next big moneymaker, but most importantly and fortunately for us because of his deep and honest desire to make the most accurate and cohesive comic book-to-film adaptation in the history of cinema.  Well Brian I am thrilled to say that that is precisely what has been achieved with your amazing film X2: X-Men United!",2003
7,"They've done a hell of a lot right. That's my response to Singer's X-Men films; they're slick, funny, emotive and a real blast to watch. Without overdrawn character introductions and explanations, X2 launches right into seventh gear and doesn't let up.",2004
9,"This movie was great--much better than the original film, which was pretty standard as far as summer blockbusters go.  X-2 skipped all the awkward and unnecessary attempts at a backstory (and I'm speaking as someone who knew next to nothing about the XMen when I saw the film) and went straight for an intelligent route.  The characters were fascinating and the special effects were truly pretty good--and that's saying something, since I'm usually bored out of my mind by that kind of thing.Some of the acting was absolutely wonderful.  Rebecca Romijn Stamos, Ian McKellen, Alan Cummings, Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, and Anna Paquin more than made up for the mediocre attempts of Halle Berry and Famke Janssen.",2003

Before the security guard can do anything he is down on the ground, alerting all security in the area of a mutant attack. ",2003

In the end, the film was released and of course, I wasted no time in getting to the theater to see it on opening day.",2003
10,"After the success of the first movie, Bryan Singer brings the X-Men back to the screen. He has stated X2 is the X-version of The Empire Strikes Back. He's not totally wrong: like Empire, X2 is darker than its predecessor, characters are developed and dealt with in a more mature way, and the foreboding climax is quite shocking indeed (there's even a ""I am your father""-style revelation concerning Wolverine's past, which is given more space here than in the first chapter). In fact, the movie could have been named X2: Humanity Strikes Back. ",2005

While it has by no means been a smooth ride, the fact remains that the long-running series has been a widely beloved and infinitely important one, especially when placed into historical perspective. Director Bryan Singer's original entry was one of the first major comic-to-film adaptations that convinced studios and audiences alike that comic-book movies could not only be mature and enthralling, but could be certified hits once again after the genre seemed to die-out in the 90's. And thus, a franchise was born and has stuck around ever since, through thick and thin.",2017

DC and Dark Horse comics have always been my favorites, and aside from The Punisher and Ghost Rider, I do not care too much for Marvel. However, despite that, I enjoyed the original X-Men very much. I think Bryan Singer is one of the most talented directors of his generation (see The Usual Suspects.) Yet, I was really disappointed by this sequel. Don't get me wrong, X2 is a very well done comic book adaption when compared to shameful misfires such as Hulk and Elektra, yet I do not believe it to be nearly as wonderful as everyone says. The whole film just feels so muddled and pointless to me. The ending drags on forever, and doesn't really have much of anything new to offer. Perhaps I missed something, but other than the addition of the awesome Nightcrawler character, this felt very routine and meaningless. I can't say I have very high hopes for X3 either. I do highly recommend the original X-Men, but I don't feel either of these films come close to the real masterpieces in the genre, such as Batman Begins, Hellboy, V For Vendetta, or Sin City.",2008

It has smart script that doesn't make you groan because of the stupidity of the screenwriters half the time as most of the other superhero movies do. It's really entertaining, lots of humor, magnificent fighting scenes(the opening sequence will forever remain a classic in that department IMO - astonishing combination of creative special effects, fight choreography and totally fitting great classical music), actors who  are really good and concentrated on their job(especially Ian McKellen, who is once again awesome as Magnetto) and even some actual message behind all the fights and superpowers, that really works. It also has what is always most important for a good movie and that's a smart director who knows his job. Bryan Singer is showing his talent here, getting good performances from all of his actors despite the CGI scenes being aplenty(but they are  really well done, much better than Spiderman 2 for example) and also creating a visual feast and an unique feel to the movie. And I've never even read the comics before, but I really felt close to the characters and easily got engaged in the X-Men universe.",2004

10,"""X-Men"" is responsible for reviving the once dead Super-hero genre of movies. Since then, we've seen Spider-Man and Daredevil protecting the streets of New York while accomplishing box-office success. But 'X-Men', to me, is still the best Super-hero movie since Batman. So it will be rather difficult to achieve the same kind of success with a sequel, right? This is the first 'part 2' sequel from the super-hero genre since Batman Returns. So it's sort of testing the waters, on Hero staying power. 'X2' continues right where the first left off. Wolverine arrives back from his trek in Canada,at Xavier's school for mutants. Magneto is still in a plastic prison for his attack on Liberty Island. And all is right for the mutant world. But not for long. A mutant named 'Nightcrawler', attacks the president by infiltrating the white house with his teleportation powers. Which causes civil unrest in the country. Gen. William Stryker finds out about Professer X's mutant academy, and uses the attack on the president as a means to invade it. Here groups of mutants are seperated, but they find out about Styker's plan to destroy every mutant on the planet using Professer X, and a secret weapon. This situation calls for the X-Men and Magneto's (you may have guessed, he escaped) Brotherhood to unite to save the mutant population. While not exactly better than the first, it is better than most original movies. It starts off wonderfully, like the first movie never ended. The production design was consistant with the first movie, unlike the Batman franchise. And the action was superb and top-notch. My only problems are some characters dont get as much screen time as they should, Cyclops for example is only in the movie for about 20 minutes. But he does make the best of it. And the character 'Lady Deathstryke' should have been more developed. She hardly spoke at all. But the biggest problem (while still small) is the movie is a bit anti-climactic. It does have a climax, but a bit toned down for the X-men. Just a bit. Other than that, its an exciting story with a very brave ending. Everyone gave a good preformance. Most notably, Hugh Jackman (Wolverine), Alan Cumming (Nightcrawler) and Aaron Stanford (Pyro). The movie progressed the X-Men storyline very well (unlike the Lord of the Rings: the Two Towers. I can't wait to see whats in store for us X-fans, in X3",2003
8,"I think the X-Men films have been so popular because the X-Men dare to be different. The concept of the X-Men strays far from superhero conventions. If you approach the X-Men films thinking you're getting something akin to Superman, Spider-Man or Batman, forget it.",2012
10,"Not counting X-Men: First Class since that's a different lineage if you just count X-Men, X2: X-Men United, X-Men: The Last Stand and the Wolverine movie this is the best of that bunch. The first movie a big part of the story was just establishing all of the characters so this movie has the advantage over that in everything is already in a groove without having to spend a good chunk of the movie just explaining everyones character background. Last Stand had so many flaws there's not enough time to explain them.",2012
10,"Bryan Singer really proves himself here, bringing us possibly the GREATEST superhero film ever. If you loved the first film, this one will exceed your expectations and beyond!! I'll begin with the incredible story, which will involve audiences throughout, done by Zak Penn thankfully. This time around much more screen time is devoted to personalization these characters and Singer makes sure each one gets their adequate amount of screen time.",2009
7,"Much like the tradition of the raunchy flicks of the 80s, Old School encompasses the age old tradition of tactless and tasteless film creation. Buy the oddity of the situation, this is one of those films I can tolerate. Mid-life malaise couldn't have been drawn better in the lives of Mitch, Frank and Beanie. Men who serve no purpose in society, especially to their significant others. But that's the significance of the frat house. No, it isn't about being drunk and hitting on 19-year-old girls, its about reaffirming your role in society and making the inner soul feel good and relaxed. So, say what you want about the random nudity and cussing, this film is a life affirming film for all men hitting their 30s.",2003
10,"Frank (Will Ferrell), Beenie (Vince Vaughn) and Mitch (Luke Wilson) three men who form a fraternity to legally stay in the house Mitch just purchased. This movie is jam packed with endless comedy of course it's Will Ferrell you can't help but laugh at the dude every time you see him. Old School when it hit DVD was the number one rented movie in North America thats quiet good for a movie anyone barely heard of when it first came out. But this movie caught the eyes of many fans. It should have a higher rating but I guess some people thought it was average. but to tell the truth it kicked some major comedy's to the curve. Not using so much of a teenage scene they conquered the mix of adulthood with college students forming a fan base for both a younger and older audience. By younger I mean 16 and up but usually movies either aim for 16 to 25 years of age. But this movie provides an entertainment that everyone can enjoy yes even your grandma. This movie definitely deserves a 10 and I have the power to do that. Buy this movie for god sakes it's a great movie to add to the comedy collection.",2005
10,"This has to be one of the funniest movies ever made. I laughed so hard during this movie. I've heard a lot of bad reviews for this movie, and I can't believe what some people have said. Apparently some copies of this movie were taped over with that godawful Jennifer Aniston debacle ""Picture Perfect"", because that is the only explanation that I have for the people who have said those things. Seriously, Old School has some of the funniest scenes in movie history...and I've seen a LOT of movies. Mandatory for all movie fans to see. One of the greatest movies ever created! If you haven't seen this movie yet, go get it NOW! Buy it, rent it, borrow it, steal it, whatever, just see it somehow. 10/10",2004
10,"This is the best comedy since Tommy Boy. Every college educated male between the ages of 25-50 knows someone just like Frank and Beanie. Absolutely hilarious. Will Farrell is perfect as Frank but Vince Vaughn steals the show. Half of everything Beanie says in this movie is just classic. The plot goes a little off towards the end, but it doesn't matter because my friends and I have been repeating some of the lines for the last 2 years. With all the really lame comedies that have come out in the past 5 years it is nice to see something that will stand the test of time- a modern Animal House. A little too cheesy towards the end but still a top 10 comedy of all time and a must own on DVD.",2005

Think frat, fat, and fag jokes. And, they're not even funny. Snoop Dogg and James Carville appear as lame versions of themselves. If that's not enough to turn you off, be forewarned - the performers you'd least like to see naked take off the most clothes, with Mr. Ferrell's bare ass hanging around for an interminable length of time. Apologies are in order. Director/co-writer/co-producer Todd Phillips may have taken it the wrong way when someone told him, ""This movie should be shot."" ",2010
10,"I saw Old School yesterday night on a french channel completely by chance. I knew nothing about it. It's a wonderful movie. I hadn't laughed like this since years. The main characters are caricatures but hilarious (especially Franck the tank...), the story is completely stupid (but fantastic) and the parties these thirty year old men who don't want to grow up organize are contagious and push you to go back to university with a good beer... Some celebrities make successful appearances (Juliette Lewis, Sean William Scott...) playing completely deranged characters, adding energy and fun to this well rhythmic comedy.",2005
9,"I just got out of Old School and let me say I laughed myself silly. Todd Phillps has made a great follow up to Road Trip and the same way Tom Green stole the former, Will Ferrel steals every scene he's in. Luke Wilson and Vince Vaughn also have equally funny scenes. If you want a funny movie then this is for you.",2003

The plot is original and hilarious and you can watch it from front to back 10 times in a row and still laugh every time. I'm a huge Will Ferrell fan and he doesn't disappoint. As Frank ""the tank"" he manages to be one of the funniest characters in movie history. This is a movie that most guys can relate to. If you've ever wanted to get back to the days of partying and girls, yet are stuck in the boredom of everyday life, then this movie will have you rolling around. Hecks, i'm even contemplating starting up my own fraternity. I can only hope that there will be a sequel to this one. I'll be the first in line to see it when it opens.",2005

Don't see it, it's not funny and can make you totally idiot. If you live in the U.S., this movie was rated R for strong language and nudity. But if you live overseas, be cautious with your children (if you have) because the movie was allowed to all audiences (in most of European countries). Prevent them from watching this awful and very vulgar recipe. All you will find in it is rubbish at all levels. Not even a piece of laughter. In the same category, avoid movies like ''Not another teen movie'', ''American Pie 3'', ''Van Wilder Public Relations ''. Rate : 1 out of 10.",2005
1,"(I'm from Europe. Sorry for my English) I can't believe I spend half an hour of my valuable life watching this crap! This thing is totally crap! Anyone call this a comedy and is ready for drowning! Most of the scenes were disgusting, the air was full of these stupid American habitats and way of life which make me sick and I really couldn't believe my eyes when I saw an actor like Will Ferrell running totally naked in the streets after that ""party"" - for God's sake! Do you call this a movie? I call it the reason why Steven Spielberg will suicide! I really hated this ""film"". I know I a being rude but and only I rent this DVD really strikes me! If you are not Americans 1st) thank God and 2nd) break this DVD! Oh! And sth else! I just noticed that this monster - with the bad meaning - is going to have a sequel! With the same characters! Sorry, but this cannot be commented! WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE UNIVERSE?",2006
1,"To start with, why make a comedy that is for the most of it not even funny? If your idea of a good laugh is Will Ferrel showing off his white fat ass running naked in the streets this film may be promising. But something is really wrong in this screaming advertisement of ""male freedom"" of brainless vulgarities parading as ""real men, untamed and free"" to go get ass drunk and something really wrong with imposing the idea that for men to have a good time must exclude marriage and children and certainly should include blow jobs as the utmost desirable form of sex.",2010

I got the Unrated verson and made the mistake of watching it with my family... I might have been the only one who liked it besides my younger brothers. This is not a slapstick comedy and its not a dark one either. Rent this and watch it with your friends.",2003
1,"I can't believe that people that are older than the age of 18 actually liked this movie. It is moronic, childish, and immature. Will Ferrell does his usual SNL acting, which wasn't to good in the first place. Everyone else seemed to be in this movie because they wanted the paycheck. Therefore, didn't take this job seriously and did not do the best job they could have. I think that everyone in this movie was trying to pretend that they were actually younger and more immature than they actually where. Adding to the actual negativitity of this movie. I don't know how to explain how terrible this movie is without actually using bad language and added swear words. The best way to describe it is that this movie is for the very immature and self centered losers who peaked in high school and couldn't climb out of being a kid and actually become a REAL Adult who is successful personally as parents and REAL Adults. I am very disappointed. Unless you are a 15 year old male kid then I suggest that you keep away from this movie.",2012
10,"The great thing about Old School is the lack of pretension in the story and the characters. Yet another film where will ferrell steals the show, just as he did in zoolander and starsky and hutch (thats no disrespect to stiller, vaughn or the Wilson boys!). This film has so many wee lines and scenes which you may not even notice the first time you see it but become hilarious and unforgettable after several viewings with your friends over a few beers. One example is the way Ferrell reacts after (SPOILER?) taking his first beer at the party and there is of course the well known brilliant consequences of these beers, not to mention the scene with the tranquilizer dart! A great show which fans of ferrell, Wilson and co. will love and anyone who enjoys dumb, entertaining comedies about grown men acting like complete idiots!!!",2005
10,"Master and Commander succeeds not so much in the fact that it has an exceptional plot, but in the fact that it carries the viewer along on its voyage exceptionally. It follows the voyage of Captain ""Lucky Jack"" Aubrey sailing for the English empire while being chased by a French vessel during the Napoleonic Wars. It's not an entirely innovative or original plot, but it's the experience rather than the plot that drives this movie. The chemistry between the characters and strong performances by all is what make it an exceptional movie. Rather than casting good-looking Hollywood types as crew members, Peter Weir went after people who look like believable seamen who are also great actors in their own right. The cast even had a sort of boot camp training so that everyone knew how to make the ship function. It is this attention to detail that make the movie so believable and enjoyable. Rather than indulging itself in melodrama and Hollywood type moral-based clichés, this film pulls no punches about how it perceives the workings of a British Naval ship to function in the early 19th century. It simply bleeds authenticity at every corner. Excellent performances by Crowe and his doctor right-hand-man played by Paul Bettany only add to the thrill.",2004
9,"And surprised I was. After hearing a friend rant endlessly about it, and having nothing to do one Friday night, I rented Master and Commander. The marketing staff should be cackling in glee, that a female in her 20's, would love this movie. It's an amazing movie. Russell Crowe is a force of nature, and all the other actors from Paul Bettany to Billy Boyd give wonderful performances. I especially enjoyed the details of life at sea, though most would call them boring. The day after my 5-day rental, I had to run to the nearest shop and buy the DVD, and have since re-watched it endlessly. I've never seen a more beautifully adapted, filmed and acted movie. Five stars out of five.",2004
10,"A very complete tale, interwoven with beautiful cinematography, powerful performances (Russel Crowe, especially), masterful score (Bach, Motzart...to name two),and a truly believable storyline with many twists. At the heart of which is the conflict inside Capt. ""Lucky"" Jack Aubry (Russel Crowe) who balances his duty to the British Empire and his personal relationships with friends and crew members on board the HMS Surprise. All this while playing cat and mouse with a french enemy vessel that is twice his ship's size and double her strength. The conclusion is a great blending of commonality of human cause and duty. All in all, this is one of the most well rounded stories I've ever seen on the motion picture screen.",2004
10,"Peter Weir has directed a bunch of will-be-Oscar-nominated movies. For me, this is not a merit for a filmmaker, since Oscar-dramas are usually 95% of entertainment, which by itself isn't interesting. His style is very compromising and clean, you are not surprised by originality, but you can enjoy the professional touch he has in his work.",2005
10,"Interestingly, Russell Crowe helps rather than hinders the picture. It's hard to believe that he's such a jerk when out of character, because his acting as the captain is totally believable. His character is great because he's smart, very stern, but very caring of his crew. While they fear him, they look up to and idolize him too.",2004
10,"From start to finish, this movie had me feeling every emotion, except hate. I found the brotherhood outstanding, the witty dialog at times near on side splitting, for e.g. When Aubrey suckered Maturin into the Weevil analysis. Maturin's response was equally as funny, but then Bettany has the ability to rise to the occasion in practically every role I have seen him in. Crowie, once again, Brings a fictional Character to life, and if you didn't know any better, you would think the story was based off a real life account. Killick, he kills me, "" Killick"" yells Aubrey for the Albermarle, "" I'm already ere in-nit I "" I have watched this flick now about 10 times, and I just don't tire of it, because each time something else catches my eye. I wish I could just climb aboard that vessel and experience the sea-dog life, as I am a sailor from way back. All the Actors in this movie, collaborate to make it a memorable epic. Weir When are you doing another? If you do, get Crowie and Bettany back, and Killick please. Loved it.",2005
10,"Me being a seaman in the US Navy for four years and spent a few years in the merchants serving on board cruise and cargo ships in both oceans Atlantic and Pacific. I honestly think director Weir has put together his best Maritine sea saga yet. The crew looked like a crew on an 18th century sailing vessel. the costumes were authentic looking. There was a scene near the end where Crowe was up on the poop deck standing on the starboard side , the cameras was panning away from him, To me that was a classic pose.Everything about that picture was done well. Since the first time i saw this film i must of watched it about a dozen times more . My hat goes off to all who were involved in the making of this fine motion picture.I also understand that originally the french ship was to be an American one , but was changed for the American audience.One other post script There was a scene of a few crew members on there hands and knees scrubbing the wooden deck with a cobble stone what they were doing for the land lubbers out there is called holy stoning the deck. Its like sanding the old wood off the deck surface bringing up the new wood this is a practice that is still done today .",2005

The end though, no spoilers really, was ... well I sprang up out of my seat and hollered at the screen, slapped my leg and wish the movie would never end. The more I thought about the film, the more I read into it, the better it became. It is more than a war film or a sea film, it portrays the old world, and the new together.

Absolutely absorbing in every respect it affirms Peter Wier as one of the best story-tellers working in Hollywood today.",2007
10,"This is a wonderful film that speaks of a time when ships were wood and men were iron. The Royal Navy truly shaped the modern world we know and understand today. It was a time when our ships, Royal Navy, Merchantmen and indeed, Privateers, ruled the waves with their bravery, discipline and determination. Master and Commander is a true classic that will stand the test of time, because the era it speaks of is timeless. The performances were all magnificent but the real stars were the ships Surprise and Acharon. The detail was amazing and I really felt the Visual Effects team really should have received an Oscar, it was just unfortunate they were up against The Lord of the Rings that year. I rate this film very highly and would recommend it to anyone wishing to see a historically accurate and highly memorable piece of cinema. ",2006
10,"I was first bothered to see, when i came to the IMDb.com site for Master and Commander that the sample review that was available was that of a person who hated the film. It upset me, but i have no real problem with it. In fact, it's good to see that there is a difference of opinion. It is hard for me to remember what i first thought when i first saw the movie, because since then i have completely delved myself into the world of Patrick O'Brian. First of all, let me say that i must have liked the movie well enough to buy it, because i now own it and watch it a lot. What i think made this movie great was the fact that it got me to read the books. i loved it so much, i went out and bought the books. The movie, unlike what was stated in a previous review, is not overly-nautical. In fact, it explains very little of the nautical process, unlike the books. It took me several weeks and about 2 or 3 books into the series to figure out the nautical terms, and i still have trouble with a few, but i'm much better now. Speaking of the books, this review said that 'Purportedly it's factual and based on real people'- wrong. It is based on the books. And in fact, it is not entirely based on the books in which it is named after (Master and Commander- the 1st book, and The Far Side of the World- the 10th book). The ""lesser of two weevils' joke is taken from the 6th book, and the plot is not from the 1st book at all and only bits of it are from the 10th book, other elements of the movie are taken from various other books. WHat makes this movie so great is the fact that it melded these elements wonderfully, without being overly-nautical. Paul Bettany, being my favorite, did excellent, though he really didn't have much (in comparison to the character in the books). Russel Crowe i thought did great- he really captured the character wonderfully, minus the occasional stupidity exampled by the character in the book. There are several elements about this movie that make it a movie and not an adaptation of the book. For instance, in the book, Jack is fat and Staphen is ugly- this is obviously not the case in the movie. It wouldn't work well in the books, but it works magnificently in the movie, and i'm glad i saw the movie before i read the books, though i don't think i would have been disappointed had i read the books, then seen the movie. The whole point of this is to simply say that if (1) the movie was half as nautical as this viewer might think, then he would have been too lost to even finish the movie. He wouldn't even know how they got from one place to the other (as i often am in the books). (2) It's not based on true events, it's based on books. And in all of those points, are my opinions. Enjoy.",2004
10,"Very reliable entertainment, as Las Vegas amuses as well as intrigues, very light hearted and very much bolstered by Josh Duhanel!! I like this television show and I think that many people watch it as a form of escapist voyeurism...Voyeurism in this case is very positive, and many females in this series are very nice to look at...This show incorporates Las Vegas legends such as Wayne Newton as intermittent characters to authenticate the Las Vegas genre!! There have been copious depictions of sin city, this is one of the better efforts...The producers and directors are lucky to have James Caan in the show, as he is very much a totally accomplished actor!!! By and large, I like the T.V. Show Las Vegas and I watch it on Fridays, I watched it on Mondays as well, but with Monday Night Football, I could see why NBC switched it to Fridays...Nonetheless, I like Las Vegas a lot!!",2006

He really brought a nice fresh addition to the show. What does NBC have now? Lame reality and night time game shows. I mean come on Keep the Old and Tired Law and Order? Not even putting Jack McCoy as DA can keep the show interesting. Gee let's keep quality program like Deal or No Deal or ED? ER should be put out to pasture to. NBC is worse now than it was in Pre Seinfeld Cheers days. With cable and internet, NBC cannot afford to fall flat on its face.PLEASE BRING BACK VEGAS! i remember when Homicide Life on the Street ended the way it did. At least they had a two hour series final. Hey CBS are you listening? Please pick up Vegas it is a great show.",2008

A hunk on a television show is a must in order for women to enjoy watching something, especially just for purposes of innocuous entertainment!!

10,I think that Vanessa Marcil is the best actor in the cast. She makes Sam one of the best character on the show. James Cann is also pretty good. I love it when he worried about Delinda. One of my favorite scenes in when Ed and Delinda are beating the crap out of some guy. That was funny. Nikki Cox is also good and she has great chemistry with Josh Duhamel. Lara Flynn Boyle was awesome in her guest role. I wish they hadn't killed her off. The show has a great cast with no bad actors which isn't something you often see on TV. I still think Vanessa Marcil is the best though. She should have got an Emmy in my opinion. It's a shame the show was cancelled,2009
6,"Now I'm only at the the end of the second season, but I have started to enjoy this show more and more. This reminds me of some of mid 80's show like ""Magnum P.I"" & ""Hawaii Five-0."" It's a show that doesn't take itself too seriously and knows it. Unlike so many of the shows today which take everything seriously. Don't we have enough unpleasant issues in everyday life and the world to just go and watch it at home as well? It just seems a shame to have to deal with it every week too! It's nice to see a usually simple show try to entertain us tortured & overworked (most of us that is) folks instead of all the dramatic and unfunny garbage on TV. I am looking forward to the great Tom Selleck back to his rightful place on Television. James Caan will be missed, but the great new character he is portraying brings some freshness to the show. Give this a try if you are looking for a good old fashioned fun show.",2007

Needless to say that after seeing a dozen or so episodes I think this description is right on the money. An assortment of pretty boys and strutting model types play out an assortment of paper thin stories while all the time trying to pretend they are serious business people. One dimensional characters, in a one dimensional setting, pursuing one dimensional stories. That pretty much sums up Vegas. I still watch from time to time to see if the show is trying to evolve and take itself a little serious but alas to no avail. So far.",2008

5,"You can't really rate this show more than 5. It's very superficial, but it's watchable, in other words, if you are bored enough, you could chain-watch several episodes and be fulfilled, on a very primal level. There is a lot of TNA, which although mentally degrading, will allure a large male fan base. Molly Simms, whom prior I didn't care for (seeing as she was, seemingly, just a hot blonde airhead) actually puts in a pretty good performance, but the real jewel in the cast is James Lesure, who plays Mike Cannon, and steals every scene he's in. Josh Duhamel, who plays Danny, is a rather palid, one-dimensional actor, with a performance to boot, and James Caan is James Caan. The show isn't particularly funny, or suspenseful, but it's light and it's easy.",2007

6,"2 years after the surprising success of ""Jeepers Creepers"", Victor Salva returns with a sequel that continues where the original left. Although at first reluctant to making a sequel, Salva crafts a competent horror film that continues exploring the formula of the supernatural hunter in the desolated rural setting. Despite having the obvious flaws of a minor sequel, ""Jeepers Creepers II"" is a worthy follow up that has its own share of tricks to keep the fans happy.",2006
8,"Sequel to the terrific 2001 horror film is a wildly fun ride, even if it doesn't quite live up to the chilling original.",2005
8,"I really resent that talent and genius have no say in who they inhibit. It hurts that I enjoy a Woody Allen movie or book, and it hurts when I like the Jeepers Creepers films.. Victor Salva was convicted of raping one of his 12 year old co stars in one of his earlier films. He went to prison, paid a fine and now he is out, making millions of dollars and probably watching a lot of child pornography at home ( which he was also convicted of) I suppose , unlike Woody Allen, at least this guys movies make sense. He makes twisted movies, horror films. Which you would half way expect from someone that did. So despite my real trepidation at giving a high rating , it is a good horror movie. So is the first. Great idea, great monster, great horror. I have to admit. Thought it less than a coincidence that these movies feature a monster/demon that feeds on and mutilates young men ( Victor Salvas type) that in this particular film, they are shirtless, good looking and sun bathing. That the demon seems to become sexually aroused at the sight of them, licking the window and shuddering as if having a orgasm , while they scream in fear. Yep. This is probably a jack off movie for the director and I'm sure he probably violated a few of these fame hungry actors in more than one way . But it's a good horror movie. Period.",2014
7,"I recently re-watched the first Jeepers Creepers and I don't really get why so many people seem to hate it. Sure, it had quite a disappointing climax and Victor Salva is an infamous figure in Hollywood but his visions did lead to one of the best horror films in the post-Scream era. And the same goes for part two! If you leave logic behind, this is quite an intense and well-elaborated scary movie. Opposite to most directors nowadays, Salva perfectly knows how to create suspenseful situations and emotional devastation. The Creeper (portrayed once again by Jonathan Breck) is a far-fetched new horror icon but it does bring terror in the most isolated outlands of America. This sequel takes place a few days after the original (of which the happenings can be heard on radio-broadcasts all the time) and features a bus full of high school jocks and cheerleaders terrorized by the Creeper. Judging by their fear's smell, he picks out victims to devour and to re-furnish his rotting corpse. ",2004
9,"Now this is what I call some good old entertainment. The creeper is one of the best movie icons out there in my opinion. I thought the first movie was quite mediocre. It was all a bit too cheesy for my liking. But then this sequel came. At first, I didn't't expect too much from it: I rented it at the local Videoland. But when I watched it, I was sold. I bought it at the very next opportunity and I watched it 3 times so far (quite a lot in my book). It's too bad the dutch release is a sorry excuse for a DVD but hey, this one is all about the contents! The plot is quite simplistic, and it's no Oscar material but if you're looking for some good entertainment with a mean ""mofo"" playing the star of the evening, this should be your pick. The action is wonderful and it has a healthy dose of humorous moments (well, they may not be humorous to some but to me they are :)).",2008
5,JEEPERS CREEPERS II ,2005
7,"More elaborate sequel to the effective monster movie of 2001, ""Jeepers Creepers II"" is more about action than anything else. It's definitely not as creepy (although it does have its spooky moments) and since we now know a fair bit about the Creeper, the mystery element is gone. This story takes place on the last day of the Creeper's feeding cycle, a few days after the events of the first film. A basketball team is returning from a championship game, and the Creeper, after snatching a kid away from his farmer father, tails the teams' bus, crippling it by ruining the tires with something akin to a ninja's throwing stars. It proceeds to decimate the coaching staff & the bus driver, and then terrorize the teens, making sure they can't escape. It's true enough that there are many points in the script with which a viewer can take issue - even yours truly had a hard time buying some of them, and he's a pretty forgiving person. Things tend to get particularly muddled when it comes to the big climax as the teens finally leave the bus, and we wonder where they all get to from scene to scene. It does take a lot of suspension of disbelief to enjoy this movie, but if one can accomplish this, ""Jeepers Creepers II"" does reward us with some exciting moments and some extremely amusing money shots. For one thing, it's a total hoot to see the Creeper forced to regenerate certain body parts. It gets a LOT more damage done to it this time around; it's good to see various assorted characters be able to fight back. Particularly interesting is the vengeance-obsessed farmer Jack Taggart (veteran character actor Ray Wise (""RoboCop"", 'Twin Peaks') getting a rare case of top billing), who fashions some killing implements using his post puncher. Naturally, due to there being a greater number of characters this time around, they don't get fleshed out too much, although writer / director Victor Salva tries to give the material some meat by introducing an element of racism. Overall, this suffers the same fate as many sequels, lacking the originals' freshness and in truth it doesn't give the viewer too many people for whom they can really root. At least it allows Justin Long to reprise his Darry character from the first film, appearing in ghostly form to offer warnings and information to one of the characters here. Nothing especially good, but not bad either; fortunately, one thing it's not is boring. Seven out of 10.",2012
6,Not since the early days of Wes Craven thrillers have we had a really good fright flick to scare us in true Halloween fashion. This one does the trick thanks to some extra good CGI effects and some scary situations in the middle of a deserted countryside where teens find themselves menaced by a winged creature determined to make them his flesh-eating victims.,2006
7,"The first ""Jeepers Creepers"", which was released in 2001, brought much-needed life into an ailing genre of films.  That movie redefined horror and its settings, which instead of the usual ominous darkness, and confined spaces, took place mostly out in the open and in broad daylight.  The movie also introduced us to a truly terrifying creature that could give any other slasher a run for their money.  That movie earned a lot of its merits through tension, genuine shocks, and a general cloud of mystery of the ""Creeper"" monster.  It didn't try to gross you out with the requisite gore, but the movie worked because so little was explained and a lot was left up to the viewer.    ",2003

I was in my club hoping to watch a GOOD movie and my friend brought this in and after I watched it, there could be only one word to describe it; ""bullc***"". This movie felt like a 10 minute episode of SpongeBob season 6 as it was very boring. The main synopsis here is that a bus full of kids gets stuck in the middle of a strange road near a forest, I think it was; i.e. like the middle of nowhere. They soon argue about stupid things and soon a hideous monster comes to ravage them which ISN'T scary at all! Like as I said in my title, I even find Teletubbies scarier than this insanity, what the writers call a horror movie. It doesn't seem like a movie at all due to the one location plot if ya know what I mean.",2015
10,"Jeepers Creepers II is much better movie then the first one ever was and i think is the best one of the two! Here we find out more about the Creeper like who he is, what is he want's. Better story then was in first one, high school kids on corn field. Part 2 is the best one of the Creeper. I was also reading about Gina Philips that she declined offers to reprise her role as Trish Jenner in sequel but i'm so glad that Justin Long did return in this movie as Darry Jenner when he warned Minxie Hayes what is going to happened to her and her friends and what has happened to him. Ray Wise did great job as Jack Taggart Sr. getting revenge on Creeper for kidnapping his younger son. Great story, plot, writing and acting i was really surprised with this movie. The best one of the two. I still don't understand why people don't like this movie, criticizing and saying not better then the first one or first one is the best? You don't have a taste in movies. What did you except that is going to be like 1st one a copy of the movie? What's wrong with you? Part 2 beats the first one and you can't say it was the worst one when it was not! You don't understand this movie if you leave complain about it!",2012

10,"Yes, oh yes.  This was great.  I loved this movie even more than the first. The odd thing was that the CREEPER was able to fly faster than what appeared to be, the SPEED OF LIGHT.  He was super fast at flying.  I liked the way he stayed still enough to view.  The scene where he was staring into the bus was terrific.  One thing though, how come the father didn't just crush him into sawdust after the 23rd day?  Instead, he is waiting for him to awake???",2003

2,"Jeepers Creepers 2 (2003): Dir: Victor Salva / Cast: Ray Wise, Eric Nenninger, Nicki Aycox, Garikayi Mutambirwa, Luke Edwards: Every bit as stupid as the original and it is filled with characters that are about as bright as a pile of cow dung. The creeper apparently feeds every 23 years and in the opening scene it makes off with a boy that thought it was a scarecrow. His father and brother make chase and are surprised when it takes flight. Cut ahead to a bus load of moron football playing teenagers who become stranded when a boney object is found embedded in one of the tires. Before long the adults are snagged leaving the teenagers to bicker while the creeper places them on the lunch menu. They use the bus radio to call for help and it is overheard by the farmer in the film's opening who arms his truck with a harpoon. Stupid and irritable showcasing special effects and mayhem. Directed by Victor Salva who made the very stupid first movie as well as another annoying piece of sh*t called Powder. Ray Wise at least is putting in a reasonable effort as the farmer who is aiming for revenge and justice against the creature who violated his family. Luke Edwards plays the older brother of the first victim who witnesses the attack in the film's opening. The teenagers unfortunately have more air in their heads than a hot air balloon. The bus should be driven over this senseless junk. Score: 2 ½ / 10",2015

7,"Casting for this film was brilliant. In fact, it could not have been anything less, given that the final edited product - which boasts of great interplay and chemistry between the crew, cast and the kids- was a great family film (decent, entertaining, and heartfelt). What is particularly nifty is that in this film, like some others including Judge Reinhold's Vice Versa (1988), we get to see a children's movie for adults with both the kids and the adults sharing equal stage presence, which really is splendid. ",2005
8,"I've seen this movie a couple of times and I'm feeling rather mixed about it. On one level I have a new kind of respect for Eddie, seeing him in a nice family movie that I can show my baby cousins and still laugh at myself. However I also know that we've passed the point of no return on this one, we will never again see the strong 80's Eddie that we once loved. I suppose we should look at this as a new chapter in the career of one of America's funniest men, and while it is depressing I'm still slightly awed that Eddie is still on the scene. After several blundering movies and one very sorry attempt at singing stardom we find an enduring man who can in fact change with the times. So for all the Daddy DayCare bashers I think you should just be glad the our favorites Murphy man is still around.",2005

Nothing inappropriate either. It is one of those movies that you come away smiling. It's a feel good movie. I imagine if more people would support these kinds of movies maybe Hollywood would make more. I do wonder if there are more people than we think who secretly enjoy a good wholesome movie. And love Steve Zahn. Eddie Murphy is so good when he keeps it clean. He seems genuinely nice and, of course, love his voice for animated characters.",2013

But then again, you can't put this film down simply because the kids were so great. So, I put down Eddie Murphy, who must be longing for the days of Beverly Hills Cop.

Yes, it's a cheesy movie and very typical, but you have to learn to have a little fun with it. It reminded me a lot of ""Kindergarten Cop"".

The plot doesn't sounds great but it does have some potential, Fortunately, it delivered as this is film was actually quite funny. It wasn't over the top funny or Finding Nemo funny but it defiantly can stand on its own. At most times Daddy Day Care may just seem like a film with a bunch of screaming kids and nothing else which isn't true as there are many laughs to be found as well. Eddie Murphy stars and gives quite a funny performance. The real stars of the film though are the little kids. Most of them were funny, some were annoying but they were all tolerable. Regina King plays Kim and she doesn't really appear in the film very much but gives a funny line or two. Steve Zahn was really funny as Marvin. Sure sometimes his character was too stupid to like but it never crosses the line. Anjelica Huston plays the same role I usually see her in, she plays a mean person well but it is tiring seeing her do the same thing. Lacey Chabert has a small but funny role and she is a bit underrated. Jeff Garlin wasn't that good, like when compared to everyone else he was weak and not very funny either. Steve Carr directs and does a decent job, nothing special. I don't know why I liked this movie as much as I did. It was stupid and kind of had a weak story but I still liked it. It does get dull at times, particularly the beginning as it starts off slow but it becomes funnier as the film continues. The running time is 92 minutes so it wouldn't be that much of a punishment to watch. The movie isn't very clever it's a simple film but it does contain enough laughs to entertain most people. Daddy Day Care is also a lot better then The Haunted Mansion. So, if you have a choice between the two, I would go with this one.

Eddie Murphy, Jeff Garlin|Phill| and Steve Zahn are the perfect trio for this movie, and they are the main reason this movie succeeded as well it did. This was actually my 2nd time viewing this movie. I first came across this movie when I ordered it in my hotel room. I enjoyed it than, and I enjoyed it just as much now. Anjelica Huston played the perfect villain for this movie, and I must say watching her get the injustice that deserved in the end was a real treat.

Till one day they decide to run a daycare center, much of the dismay of their wives. But managing a bunch of 4 year olds is not as easy as it seems. But when they become a success, an evil strict school principal sets up a scheme to ruin them. And that's all I will tell you about the movie. It was a funny family orientated movie.

6,"This cute, harmless comedy proves that Eddie Murphy doesn't have to be wearing a fat suit or brandishing a firearm to be entertaining. Murphy stars as the recently laid-off Charlie Hinton, who, with a friend, decides to open a daycare with men as the caregivers. That opens the door to all sorts of fun rambunctiousness, as the tykes make the entrepreneurs earn every penny. The side story about a prim and proper care center that won't let kids be kids is amusing, if not familiar, and makes a gentle social commentary. Murphy's performance is strong and convincing, and the comic supporting cast -- a geeky Steve Zahn and Saturday Night Live alum Kevin Nealon among them -- is great. This is a family film that you won't watch just for the kids' sake.",2006
8,"I had never heard of this Comedy Central series, nor had I even heard of comedian Dave Chappelle, until after the first two seasons that were completed had aired, and probably after Chappelle had walked out of the third season. I was introduced to the show on The Comedy Network in Canada, where I started seeing ads for it, and eventually started watching reruns. Obviously, it didn't take long for me to see that it was a crude, very politically incorrect show, but I had seen and enjoyed that type of comedy before, and found this show pretty funny overall. It was basically the same when I recently decided to watch episodes on DVD after not seeing any in a while.",2008
8,"While ""Chappelle's Show"" was occasionally uneven (which is true of any skit comedy show), the successful skits easily predominated. But the reason I liked the show so much was because it was so brave and honest--particularly when it came to race. Chappelle's program was the only show on television that talked openly and honestly about race--something ALL folks need to do in this ultra-politically correct world. But even more importantly, these supposedly offensive skits were hilarious and worked. Plus, no one I know felt offended by them--particularly the wonderful skit about the blind black man who hated blacks because he didn't realize he was black! Another great one was his getting the seemingly white bread Wayne Brady on his show for an insanely funny skit! Brave...and insanely funny. Probably NOT a show for kids but wonderfully entertaining.",2013
2,"I am in a distinct minority when it comes to this show. I found Chappelle oddly amusing as the insult comic in THE NUTTY PROFESSOR but not the slightest bit amusing on his own show. The characters, the routines, the gags, all leave me cold. Clearly, the show is aimed at a very specific audience. I just don't happen to be a member of that audience. I grew up during the heyday of Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy. Now, those guys were funny. Chappelle is about as funny as Steve Urkel. Come to think of it, Urkel has had funnier moments. And now I have to type some nonsense to get up to IMDb's required 10 lines. Bear with me while I do this. At least my filler is funnier than anything Chappelle ever uttered.",2006

10,"The Chappelle show is a Three season long sketch comedy show hosted by Dave Chappelle. The series is closely related to Key and Peel in the sense of how the show works. The Show is made up of different skits put together for a 30 minute episode. Dave Chappelles creates high quality skits. Most of his skits involve celebrities, comedians, and movie stars that were popular around the episodes launch. Some of his appearances include Charlie Murphy, Rick James, Red Man, Lil Jon and many more. The Chappelle show is the most popular Comedy DVD to ever be released. The first day season one was released it grossed over 1 million dollars. Although the show was very popular not everyone agreed with his style of comedy. Most of Daves skits are vulgar and mature ,some episodes even deal with racism. If this is a turn off for you then you should look elsewhere for sketch comedy because this show is not for you. Another show related to this is the Key and Peele show. Both shows are made up of sketches and put together to make an episode. The Chappelle show is more popular than Key and Peele show but everyone will have an opinion on which is better. In my opinion the Chappelle show is better because his sketches are well thought out, planned, and executed. I highly recommend buying the Chappelle show. I got all three seasons brand new for a low price of $20, an amazing price for the amount of gut busting laughter you will have from watching this show.",2014
10,"When i heard of the Chappelle's Show i saw 1 sketch about a man name Clayton Bigsby a Black white supremacist LOLL! how is that possible? the man was blind and in the shelter for blind kids the nurses and the Doctors decide to tell him that he was white because it would be easier for him with the other kids because he was the only African-American and he grow up to become a white supremacist spokesman, publish 4 books with tittles like (smell like ""N"" Word) all about white supremacy and in his public appearances he uses the Ku Klux Klan hood so nobody knew that he was black until... Well you have to see it ; But that was it for me ,I'm addicted to his unapologetic ,racist (to all races) stereotypical , dark and clever humor and his impersonations are amazing I just found it",2012
9,"This show is beyond funny. Dave Chappelle is hilarious. I like his brand of comedy. He has the jokes and sketches that make everything funny. I love his Tupac sketch with that song. That was the funniest sketch he has done. I couldn't stop laughing through the whole thing. I also like some of his early season episodes too. Dave Chappelle has starred in some countless funny movies. This show features some of the funniest episodes of comedy made so far. I think he should make another season but that is my opinion. All in all this show is one of the funniest shows i've seen. Also When the Chappelle Show first came on Comedy Central, I was amazed that they were able to air it. It made so many racist jokes that I thought for sure it wouldn't\'t last 3 episodes.",2012
8,"This is one of my favourite TV shows of all time and one of the greatest sketch comedy TV series ever made in my humble opinion. Dave Chapelle does an amazing job as the host and he is also in pretty much every single sketch that they do on the show. The Rick James bits are of course all time classics and I wish there was more of that, it is a real shame that this show only lasted two seasons before all the bitterness and craziness that made this show end. It's a shame how much great comedy there still could have been if he had decided to stay on the air but I'm still just glad he did these two seasons (avoid the unaired extra episodes they put together after he quit because they are not very good at all and only make the show seem worst). The stuff with Wayne Brady is also classic, and the black blind klan member, and the crack head character, so much great comedy in this series!",2010
10,"Dave Chappelle is a genius. He takes racist stereotypes and skewers them in the funniest ways imaginable. Some critics say he is too foul mouthed and crude, but walk into any middle school in America and you'll hear 11-year-olds saying worse stuff than he does. Dave is a brilliant comic and it's a shame this hilarious show didn't last longer. If you've never seen it, SEE IT!! Some of the best sketches:",2009
10,"As shows like Mad TV and Mind of Mencia finally see their ends, one must look back on Chappelle's Show and wonder what comedy television would be like today if Chappelle didn't get burned out and leave the show. Believe it - Comedy Central wasn't paying him ridiculous money because the show was just good. It was and will always be LEGENDARY.",2008
9,"There's no way I would call Chappelle's Show the funniest show ever, but as far as sketch-comedy, it achieves far more than the recent years of MAD TV and Saturday Night Live. From Dave's impersonations as Rick James, Prince, and Samuel L. Jackson, there's truly a laugh-a-minute with those bits. The comedy can fall flat in some skits, as it goes too far in raunchiness and loses the comedic effect intended -- but this is rare. Dave's skits are hilarious, from The Mad Real World to Charlie Murphy's True Hollywood Stories, there's a lot to enjoy.",2008
9,"My summary line comes from(if you count compilation shows as episodes)the amount of shows this ran for it's two year,two and a half(really)seasons. A shame,really,because between all the material that's out there,and the fertile minds of Chappelle and his writing co-horts(among them co-producer and writing partner Neal Brennan and Charlie Murphy),there could've been so much more than that amount of shows.But alas,between DAve's lack of enchantment of being on a television production rigors and routines(he claimed he never wanted to do more than two seasons)and the network(Comedy Central)'s demand for more shows on THEIR schedule,this show was probably doomed to only go so long. Still,that shouldn't ruin one's enjoyment of the gutsy,edgy comedy supplied here(if anything,it might ENHANCE it)which featured equal parts sketch comedy based out of celebrity parody(riffs on Prince,rapper Lil'Jon,R.Kelly and Samuel L.Jackson stick out)and sly social commentary(his take on shows like ""Law and Order"" and ""Thje Real Wrold ""spring to mind). I think I may be interested in checking out the DVD's for extras,suspecting that there may be extra material where that came from. A show that need not be missed,since syndication(WGN,among others)has kept this show circulating. Highly recommended!",2007

Good actors, a solid storyline that doesn't drag, great make-up and visual affects, and fast paced directing make this movie a must see for the serious horror fan.

Desmond Harrington is nice to look at and has a strong quality about him. these two working together can be enjoyable and have the ability to survive. this movie is different enough and scary enough to be enjoyable. i sure enjoyed it, and i bought it.",2005

7,"The title is chosen well, and from this title it's pretty easy to imagine how our protagonists get into trouble. It all starts out with Chris Flynn (Desmond Harrington, playing Joey Quinn in 'Dexter') who is out for a job interview but ends up in a huge traffic jam, which makes him search for an alternative route. Needless to say that the road he takes is a wrong turn. Driving up a dirt road through mountains and forest, he crashes into an other car. Nobody gets seriously hurt and after the initial shock they split up (of course, after all this is a horror movie). Two stay behind, the other four, including Chris, go to get some help. But they will soon find out that the crash wasn't just an accident, and that there are inbred people living around who's help you really don't want. ",2011

9,"This film shows you how a horror movie should be done with a good cast good acting and beautiful cinematography. I really enjoyed this film i thought it was very entertaining and the reason this film works is many reasons.1 you have a great location for the story to take place in which is of course deep in the woods miles from civilisation and you get the feeling of dread as the movie goes on which is a good thing in a horror film. 2 the directing and acting are all top notch in my opinion and the music throughout the film is very good. 3 this film has allot of (likeable Characters) yes that's right LIKEABLE characters and that's one thing i really like in a horror film! i like having characters we actually care about rather than some stupid bimbo characters that don't matter at all. That way when characters get killed you actually feel sorry for them because you liked them to begin with. That's one of the big reasons this film succeeds because you care about almost everyone,there were maybe one or two i didn't care much for but that's only because i knew nothing about them,however our four lead characters are extremely likable and sometimes funny and because of this you want them to survive when they get lost out in the woods. This film also holds a lot of tension which is another reason it works well and the film has quite a dark atmosphere and is a little creepy in places too. ",2013
7,"In the day and age of unoriginality and persistent remakes, we must treasure the brave and audacious horror film that know they pack in a typical formula, but are still determined to go for broke and sometimes even surprise us. That is exactly what Rob Schmidt's horror film Wrong Turn does. It has its typical side, with the formula and pretty dense characters, but it also has its creative side, showing off impressive camera-work, cinematography, and very amusing effects work. It is, what some might call, a joyous bloody excursion.",2012
7,"I used to disdain Wrong Turn as a hollow derivative of The Hills Have Eyes and for some time actually preferred the sequel, until checking it out again recently and rather changing my tune. It is still derivative of The Hills Have Eyes to an extent, Wrong Turn being among the earliest of the newer rash of inbred cannibal against resourceful prey films and The Hills Have Eyes being if not the earliest then certainly the first definitive entry in the genre. But the two differ crucially, the earlier film comes from a critical eye, a director who has watched society and sentenced it, while Wrong Turn is simply a fun horror film. And its a whole lot of fun, with some rather wonderful traits that do not seem to often appear among later films in the genre or even mainstream horror in general. The key to it all comes in the very first scene as scaling a rock face becomes a terse nightmare for a couple of cannon fodder youths. The girl falls enough to incur broken ribs and likely unconsciousness, maybe even broken legs and back but still manages to get up and keep moving. The entertaining fusion of tension and silliness seen here informs the rest of the film and it really works, especially since things never aim for truly gruelling nastiness, just engagement and fear. Thus the car crash that brings the protagonists together yields less angry recrimination than instead cooperation and good vibes and in the films barmiest moment characters perform feats similar to that which nearly killed Jackie Chan on Armour of God, one of them even with a gunshot wound to the leg. And the inbred villains of the piece can wield a bow and arrow like Robin Hood, as well as climbing trees like the most fearless of gymnasts. Its all thoroughly silly but great fun at the same time, and it never really jars with the more frightening moments (there's one real winner of a suspense sequence here), unlike say The Hills Have Eyes '06 with its ill fitted marriage of brutality and cheesy action. The gore here is almost well judged as the silliness, there isn't a whole lot of grue but whats there is mostly short, sharp and effectively savage without any appearance of trying to make the audience sick with realism. A smidgen more would definitely have been beneficial though, particularly when the villains are buying the farm. Acting is generally reasonable, a stone faced Desmond Harrington bears little charisma, but Emmanuelle Chriqui emotes to good effect, Kevin Zegers and Lindy Booth make for amusing stoners and in the best written part Jeremy Sisto has chilled out but ultimately heroic ball. And Eliza Dushku delivers mondo hotness which is a big plus. The handiest thing about the characters though is that they are all written sympathetic rather than obnoxious and self absorbed or resolutely vapid, there's a sense that the writer cares about them rather than just treating them as cannon fodder and it makes for a much more involving experience. I'm not sure I have any serious complaints about the whole film actually, it really rubbed me the right way. Actually I have one, it needed nudity. In a fun trashy horror film, nudity is virtually an essential and there ain't none here. Still righteous stuff though, strong 7/10 from me.",2011

8,"Wrong Turn is excellent proof that you don't need to re-imagine (or as I call it, ""ruin"") a classic movie to mine horror's archives for inspiration. Originality may not be this film's strong suit, but when a movie packs in as many good scares and gleefully gory bits into its lean 84-minute running time as Wrong Turn does, it's hard not to conclude that it's okay to reference the past, as long as you make good use of what you borrow.",2011
8,Well i never knew this film existed until i found it in a store it was on sale.I saw this film and to be honest it had me on the edge of my seat i did not expect the film to be that good. Well the film is about a group of people become stranded in the woods after a accident they are hunted down by really ugly flesh eating mutants. Alright lets start off the cast is nice they're good looking and they seem really real like the couple in love which is sweet. The acting is nice too but not as good as the deaths which in that time are creative like the girl who's life is cut short with the barb wire. The deaths you can say are gory. The killers in the film are really creepy and actually act like rednecks. The suspense was superb it had me on my seat i had to ask myself whats going to happen now. After i had finished watching it i watched it over and over again. I recommend this film to only horror fans,2010
8,"I wasn't to sure what to expect from this film, but i can say that i really did enjoy it.The location of the film is West Virginia and the locals are somewhat inbred. It has plenty of action and if your a fan of such movies as Deliverance, Southern comfort and Hunter's blood, then you will certainly enjoy this. If you expect to see a great film with a great plot then don't watch this, but if your looking for a bit of fun and some gory action, then watch it. What you have to remember is that this film wasn't intended to be a Hollywood smash. It's basically a budget movie, not to be taken seriously. I sat through this film and i can honestly say that it's worth watching.",2010
8,"As soon as I saw the preview to this film I wrote it off as a silly Matrix rip-off trying to attack a subject that is so tired (vampires/werewolves). I really never had any intention of seeing Underworld until my girlfriend, who saw it in theaters, repeatedly suggested I watch it.  After watching the DVD just now I must say that I enjoyed it a lot.  I was completely into the story, which is surprisingly rich and engaging.  One would have to be a bit naïve not to admit that Underworld does indeed borrow from a variety of action films, most notably The Matrix.  It should be obvious to any free-thinking person that none of the ideas present in Underworld are original, but what this film does well is take ideas that were established in the past and build on them more.  This is by no means a carbon copy of any of the films from which it borrows from.  Slow motion gun battles didn't originate with the Matrix films.  The most refreshing aspect of this movie is the story, which surprisingly has many layers and puts a totally fresh new spin on the vampire/werewolf stories.  This aspect, along with the excellent visual effects makes Underworld an enjoyable experience.  A sequel for this is inevitable, and I must say that I'm really looking forward to it.  Underworld was a very pleasant surprise. ",2004
7,"Everything you've heard from the critics, everything you know about vampires and werewolves, everything that is standard in most fantasy/action films. Then you'll enjoy this film. I, unlike a lot of fans, will not claim that this is a move masterpiece, I will not claim that this will change movie making history. I, however, will go against the critics and say that this is a good film. Not getting a chance to see this in the cinema, when it came out on video I rented it out immediately. Now, at first, I could see what the critics meant it wasn't how the trailers depicted it and the script and acting in places was a bit rusty. I put it back and gave no more thought to it. However I soon found myself thinking about the film and the bits I'd enjoyed. I soon realised that this was good because it wasn't conventional and I couldn't stop thinking about it. There had been so many plot twists, so much to take in that I knew I had to see it a second time. This time I bought it, on DVD, and I found myself watching it again and again. This film gives you wonderful villains and just when you start to hate them something nastier comes along or they give you a motive which makes you confused. In one film the world which you are presented with at the beginning, Lycans (Werewolves) vrs. Vampires, is thrown into doubt. There are no longer good and evil, it is no longer this side versus this side and our hero Selene is stuck in the middle. The thing is every villain in this film seems to be fully justifiable in their actions yet completely nasty. I was trying, after falling in love with this film, to work out where it went wrong. I realised there was too much. You are thrown into this world and you have to keep up, there is no chance to sit down and work things out. That comes after seeing the film, this world explains itself through the characters actions. It is as if this world is real and we are meant to know about it already. Their is a history, their is a false history, their are legendary characters and not all of it is gone into in particular detail. Pieces of the world's history are just thrown in by the characters, as they would be in real life, with no long detailed explanation. That mixed with the cliff hanger ending, the promise of more characters from the past. MEans that even if you weren't sure about this film, the sequel Underworld: Evolution looks like it will be amazing.",2005
8,"When Underworld was release in the theaters I didn't bother seeing it, because of the bad reviews. I recently rented it because the video store didn't have anything better to offer, that I had not already seen, and I must say that I was very much surprised. It was far better than expected. I especially liked the acting of Bill Nighy as the vampire lord Viktor, and Micheal Sheen as the werewolf leader Lucian. I think that the plot is quite strong, and it does not ruin the vampire or werewolf legend. What i didn't like as much was the werewolf costumes. I didn't find the convincing. But apart from that, it was very entertaining, and I am looking forward to see the sequel i the theaters.",2005

7,"""Underworld"" is no ordinary horror movie.  It tells the tale of a secret war between vampires and werewolves (or as they're called here, lycans).  Kate Beckinsale stars as Selene, a lethal assassin on the vampire side.  Scott Speedman plays Michael Corvin, a man who finds himself wrapped up in this brutal war.  This movie is rather well done, despite all the blood and graphic violence.  The look of the movie is dark, Gothic and brooding, which fits very well with the story.  The script is interesting, using science to bring the vampire and werewolf legends into the modern age (such as saying the lycans are allergic to silver).  The story of the bitter rivalry between to two mythic characters would make a fascinating prequel, and the sequel should follow ""Underworld"" with real impact as well.",2004
10,"I loved Underworld. But I love most decent Vampire or Werewolf films, so that's a bit biased, eh? Basing the two species on a genetic, scientific idea makes them work exceedingly well, and removes all those problems that mysticism brings to a film, like reflections or holy items. This Vamp-Werewolf model make explanations easy, rather than requiring long prologues or in-depth discussions. The whole 'virus' idea is logical, and easy to follow. It's slick, modern, fast-paced action combined with classic, Gothic Vampire & Werewolf ideas, like the Vamp's high-tech weapons being kept in a massive, stately manor. I'm a real fan of the whole colour scheme, with few colours used in any one shot, and blues used for almost everything, keeping it looking cool, and sleek. I am also a Kate Beckinsale fan, and I love Action films that don't use women like an extra person to shout 'watch out!' or hit someone over the head. K.Beckinsale's character is great for this, it's someone who could easily be a guy. (Although, I'm thinking the outfit'd need a bit of enlarging if it were)",2004
10,"Let me start this review by saying that, while this work is NOT scary, it was not MEANT to be scary. This production was classed into the genre of ""Horror,"" strictly due to the ""monster"" factor. There are ""tense"" moments, to be sure, but this is not a ""boo!"" kind of movie. There is; however, plenty of action, lots of well enacted drama and wonderful realistic effects. I was actually amazed with the apparent lack of high-dollar effects, the almost Rice-ian Vampire clans lounging in the well designed lush and lavish ""mansion,"" the gritty tension held throughout the movie, and the stunningly clever costume designs. But what held me mostly in thrall were the effects.",2003

It's just a tad absurd, though.",2006
1,"I really think that this movie was made for young, self-centered people with no knowledge of the vampire lore. It made me furious to watch Selene as I saw her as a very narcissistic person who constantly was too aware of her own appearance. It made me feel like I was watching somebody up on the catwalk each time I saw her. The way she jumped, walked, shot with her guns and the way she looked from under her hair. I was so annoyed. Completely without any kind of character. It has been stated that she falls in love with Michael Corvin but that is something we have to deduce from the fact that she kisses him. I didn't see any affection, tenderness or soft spoken words between them. She is just too hollow. ",2008

1,"I have rarely seen a movie that had SO much potential, and seemed to ignore it almost on purpose. The premise is sound: a secret war is being fought between vampires and werewolves. a great premise, but unfortunately, the flaws hold it back from being either an action or a horror, and especially from it ever being a romance. The first flaw is noticeable all through the movie. Let me get this straight, these two creatures have been fighting for years, and years, yet humans have no idea. They shoot in subways, and hotels, and sewers, yet we have no idea. In Blade the humans who knew about vampires became Familiars. They worked along side them. Here, they just don't exist. Oh, except for speedman, he exists solely for the plot, to give it a bit of life. Sorry, nothing could give this bore-heap life. The other huge flaw, is the supposed romance between Speedman and Beckinsale. It has no merit. It just evolves without rhyme or reason. There's no connection or chemistry. The script calls for a love relationship between the two, so it seems like they just through it in. They kiss, they fight along side each other, but never have chemistry. It just goes through the usual motions. Most of the characters are generic and dull. They all seem to just exist on the most basic level. They simply go on pouting or scowling the whole movie. My favorite example of this is Kraven (Shane Brolly). He keeps one angry expression on his face the entire time. He looks about two seconds away from a temper tantrum. The last big gripe I have for this movie is simple and basic: Where oh where was the action through all this? I counted two and a half basic action scenes. I wish I could have slept through this boring mess, but my insomnia was acting up that day. My rating? 1 out of 10 My advice? If your in the mood for a GOOD action horror, stay away, go rent a Blade flick.",2004

1,"I swear this is the single one film that made me throw up my hands and yell ""what's the use?"" It is the single most cliché-ridden film I've ever seen. In corner number one, we have vampires. (How original!) In corner number two, werewolves. (I didn't see that coming!) The two creatures are so clichéd that the very mention of them is a cliché. Of course, the two races are at war. (That one blew me away, it came out of nowhere!) And they both have their weaknesses; vampires to sun and werewolves to silver. (Where do they get these fresh ideas???) A vampire is in love with a werewolf. (I couldn't believe it!) And the bad guy wants to combine the two into a super-being. (Really??? OMG Best. Plot. Device. E-var!!) The movie is a direct copy of not only a novel, but two games as well. Not to mention a shameless copy of Romeo & Juliet. I mean, come on!! Why are people still copying a 500 year old play? And not even changing a single detail!!! Writers should be able to write a novel without being afraid that some producer will come along and flat-out steal the ENTIRE thing!!! And the worst part of it all is the way it shows off the worst in humanity; the mindless killing just for the sake of killing. There's no point, no plot, no point, no nothing. I've seen it all before, I don't need to see it again. What a travesty.",2005
5,"First time director Len Wiseman definitely knows how to make a good looking movie, but not much else. Mr. Wiseman has nailed down the look that is evident is most of today's vampire movies: dark, grainy, gothic, leathery, bluish hued skin and RAIN!  Lots and lots of RAIN.  Most annoyingly, outside of the terrible overacting of Shane Brolly as Craven (he espouses anger in EVERY look and in EVERY word he utters) and the stoic, zombie-like acting of Kate Beckinsale is the director's use of DOORS! Every damn scene of this movie either starts or ends (and sometimes both)with someone slamming open/closing a door, or gate. My guess is that doors must swing to and fro over 100 times in this movie.  This must have been the editor's first movie and asked the director to use the doors as cues for his cuts. Once I pointed this out to my friend, he couldn't stop laughing every time a door swung.",2003
6,"I know it's easy to put ""Terminator 3"" down. Everybody had great expectations and it was clear that this movie would have lots of enemies, especially if someone else than Cameron was going to direct. So, here it is now, T3, and the truth is, it is a good action movie, just not as good as Terminator 1 & 2.",2004
7,"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.",2006
6,"No matter what people say Terminator 3 was a turkey.The tone was wrong and bad decisions were made in the casting and character phase of the film.Sarah Conner is feebly written out of this story and the film suffers badly for missing her presence.There is also too much self referential parody,there are times when Arnie is made to look silly through the use of badly timed and misjudged comedy moments.I partly blame Jonathan Mostow,he held the reigns on this one and would have had a big say in how it all played out.I couldn't believe they went as far to copy the scene in T2 when Arnie gets his leathers in the bar only this time he gets them from a gay bar and ends up wearing 70's style plastic Elton John style glitz glasses instead of his iconic shades.This was embarrassing.Ed Furlong is replaced by the inferior Nick Stahl and Clare Danes is just filler. The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",2008

5,"I'll say that for the most part this third film by Johnathan Mostow is pretty decent. He clearly made an effort to bring back the same atmosphere that was present in the first two films. This I very much enjoyed that aspect of it all. However, there is a somewhat diminished sense of realism in my opinion. This new terminator has flamethrowers and plasma cannons, built in of course. Oh geez... But I've come to embrace that actually. Except for that scene with KAte's 'fiance'. Didn't anyone notice a guy driving with an arm through his gut. Overdone...",2010
1,"Even if there were no Terminator or T2, T3 would be a horridly mediocre movie. The original Terminator was an exercise in imagination conquering budget limitations, while T2 showed what could be accomplished if imagination were wedded to an unlimited budget. T3 shows what a tremendous budget with little imagination gets you - a terminator whose unique ability is to make her fingers into sharp points. Whoopee! There are narrative lapses too numerous to mention, such as our non-tech hero operating an atom smasher. Or a heroine who doesn't know exactly what her father does for a living traipsing into the super secret underground & armored military installation where he works. T3 operates best as a self-administered IQ test: if you thought this movie was good, you should seriously consider remedial education.",2005

10,"When I first heard that James Cameron wasn't going to be involved with the third installment to this fantastic series, I was less than pleased.  The thought of another director taking over the franchise kind of upset me, I just had to hope that they would find a director that could fill those rather large shoes.  I later heard that Jonathan Mostow was named director of T3 and was pleased due to being VERY impressed with both of his previous directorial efforts, ""Breakdown"" and ""U-571"", but of course I was still skeptical.",2003
8,"T3 was actually very good. Put it this way, if we had never been treated to the classic and innovative T2, I believe a lot more people would have been in love with T3. T3 was looking at some serious obstacles: 1.) following up T2, a monster success 2.) an aging Arnold Schwarzenegger 3.) making a cohesive story that wouldn't contradict the former Terminators 4.) making a better terminator than the T-1000.",2007
7,"In musical terms T-3 would be the 'difficult' third album, the one that perhaps didn't need to made, or was over-produced and over-hyped. Think 'Be Here Now' by British band Oasis, following in the footsteps of two hugely critically and commercially successful albums.",2007
10,"I did not expect so much after the announced names of the producers Kassar and Vajna; I also did not know anything about the director Jonathan Mostow. But I must confess that even though I still prefer the first Terminator, I very liked the third one. First I read the announcement of the T3 with a female terminator around 10 years ago in a magazine, so I was looking forward to it long time. Today I watched it (my first Terminator movie in cinema), and I declare all the staff made a good work. Ms. Kristanna Loken was so the good choice!",2003
3,The Terminator is a character idolized by thousands of people around the world. The imagery - along with unconscious symbols - made this character an icon for generations.,2004
8,"Terminator 3 was nothing short of a thrill-ride of explosions, over-the-top action and fun - although after three movies I am finding the Terminator series getting very repetitive.

1,"OK, so critically i'm forced to accept that my one star rating could be seen as maybe a bit harsh, the action was OK after all, the film looked pretty enough and the story was genuinely not as slap-dash and floored as we all dreaded it would be. As a stand alone film i could've genuinely forgiven this movie it's quirky sense of humor and cartoonish action sequences (that comedy 'DUNK' noise when Arnie is hit by a truck whilst riding the forklift truck is pure Wylee Kyote). ",2006
10,"Brilliant, really brilliant. I love this movie exactly as I loved T1 and T2. Arnie is still Arnie :) and I think, if there's a fourth part it should be with him again. I have just one little note - too much humor. Why he had to put these stupid star-glaces?? Why saying ""I'll Be Back"" and ""She'll be Back"". Just a few moments that made me a little nervous. The pressure from the first and the second part wasn't so great here because of these comedy elements. But everything else is just perfect and I'm saying to everybody - Watch this film... it really deserves your money.",2003

6,"Following James Cameron's original in this series, few could have projected Arnold Schwarzenegger's rise to Hollywood legend. The first film was a low-budget, B-grade (in theme and style only; the story was superb) sci-fi actioner. Arnie may have gone on to star in ill-advised yet somewhat bearable comedies, and the budget for ""T2: Judgment Day"" may have been among the biggest at the time, but at heart, Arnie was always a B-grade action movie actor. Films like ""Raw Deal"", ""Total Recall"", ""Commando"" and ""Predator"" reinforce his B-grade credentials. And as the final film in his career, ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" is the fitting B-grade send-off for the most popular action star of the last twenty years.",2004
10,"I'm really surprised at all the negative reviews T3 is receiving. It was as good as the previous two Terminator films, which makes this franchise the only title out there that's great, quality entertainment without any interruptions of garbage in the middle (ala Alien 3).

John reunites with an old girlfriend, Kate Brewster (Danes) who gets into the action because she's John's future wife and daughter of an Air Force General. This isn't a bad sequel, but it's not as good as the first 2 films and I missed Linda Hamilton. I still recommend this for your Terminator collection.",2012
7,"As a big fan of the Terminator movies, 1 and 2 were superb! Unfortunately, T3 suffers from the ""Hollywood blockbuster"" syndrome, the need to out perform and surpass its predecessors with bigger, bolder, more blast-worthy action.

There is always something new to discover watching and I just fall more in love with the characters each time.

I think the story of two thirty something men running into endless mishaps and comedic well timed catastrophes was what gave the show it's true to life feel. It wouldn't make sense if it all worked out in the end, and that's why I was satisfied with the ending, but I do see why some would be disappointed. All in all, a very funny show - Matt King is also very funny in this, delivers some great one liners. I doubt there will ever be another comedy to take it's place.",2016

Peep Show focuses on the lives of Mark and Jeremy. Mark is a social outcast and a loner, he is awful in social situations and longs to find a relationship. Jeremy is a unemployed loser, who enjoys sex, music and drugs (in that order), who believes he is a talented musician and thinks he is God's gift to women.

True talent is shown by the way the characters' complex personalities are so easily understood. The mother's situation is one that so many mothers can relate to. She glances away for just a moment - a moment that slips right past her when she wasn't paying full attention. Almost overnight it's as if her daughter has become a completely different person. It is an eye-opener for all parents of young teenage girls. My overall mood/feeling after watching it reminded me of how I felt after I watched The Basketball Diaries.

It is one of the first movies that I have seen where a cutter is not looked down on and where the ending does not leave the viewer with false hopes. It is an excellent movie that gives everyone a real insight into a teenage girls life. It shows very well how Tracy has a hard time coping with life, drugs and things at home so she turns to drugs, boys, sex and cutting to comfort herself. This is sad to say but this is how many teens today are learning to deal with there pain by cutting themselves and loosing themselves in drugs. Very excellent movie that will open anyone eyes and leave u sitting in your seat wondering about yourself and your children if you have any.",2006

It is honest and terrifying, for some they can relate to the pain, frustration, and confusion that the main character goes through but for others it can serve as an eye-opening view of what that life is like. For those who think this is like any other teen-on-drugs movie I'd have to say they are completely wrong. True the movie does show a girl experimenting with drugs and sex but it also taps into the emotional and psychological problems that drive kids today to do so. The honesty of the main characters cutting problems is absolutely both terrifying and breath taking. I think thirteen was one of the most truthful and beautiful movies I have seen in a long time.",2007

10,"***WARNING:THIS MIGHT BE A SPOILER*** Look, I'm no Ebert or Ropert, but I do want to say that I though this movie was amazing. I watched it when I was thirteen; I was channel-surfing and found this movie, and, it being entitled ""Thirteen"", I thought it would be interesting. I'm so glad that I watched this movie two years ago because I honestly believe that it showed me the reality of drugs and sex and that entire lifestyle (look, I'm not stupid. I know it's glamorized for Hollywood, but it's as real as movies get, okay). I honestly think that ""Thirteen"" is a very well filmed movie; one thing I noticed was that the movie began in full color, correct? but as her life got darker and darker, so did the movie. By the end, it was nearly in black and white, but when Tracy woke up after her mom found out about her cutting, it was back to color. The language used, the actions of the people, everything...just so realistic, or, as I said before, as real as Hollywood would let it get. Basically, I loved ""Thirteen"" and recommend it to any teenager who isn't impressionable enough to want to do drugs and have sex because ""Evie seems so cool"". (There's a post by a girl who tried that. What a mad, mad world we live in.) Thanks, Bianca",2006

For several minutes afterward, I still felt the power of this motion picture. The film is shot hand-held (except for three shots) which enhances realism. Holly Hunter and Evan Rachel Wood have great chemistry in this picture and their performances are top-notch (Holly should've won the Oscar). For a first-time actress, Nikki Reed's performance is also amazing. This film is probably the most real look at adolescence because it shows what teens go through and how far we (teens) are willing to go to fit in. This whole film is an American masterpiece and is a must-see for those who love movies.",2007
10,the movie thirteen in my opinion was amazing. as a teenager myself who is now 14 i can totally relate. last year i met a girl who did all that stuff the Evie did (ie. drugs sex piercing drinking smoking). In my opinion the movie is very realistic and saddening to see such young girls do this to their bodies... But the truth is girls at this age and even younger are doing it and parent across America need to open their eyes and this movie is a real eye opener. It will make you appreciate the life you have. This movie is so good. I would suggest every teen girl and her mother to go see this movie as soon as possible. You wont be sorry. But if you do go to this movie you must be warned there is sex references and cutting scenes. You must also have an open mind to watch this type of movie. But overall i love this movie and would watch it over and over again,2007

The girl that played her did an incredible job.  I read some reviews that said she over-acted and such.  I never thought that...have you ever had a spat with a 13 year old girl?

Maybe it is because we live in New York City, but I see this behavior often.  My girls were not as extreme but there were (are) definitely elements of this behavior in their teenagedom.  The mother's helplessness is something I can relate to and I think Holly Hunter did an excellent job as the loving, hip, but overwhelmed mom.  In fact, I think all the actors were wonderful.

5,"weeeelll I thought ""thirteen"" was just okay.  The main reason I found it just okay, was that it just wasn't that interesting and believable to me. Before you start bashing me for the 'believable' comment,  I'd like to address something.  Unlike many detractors of 'thirteen', I won't say the things portrayed in the movie dont happen.  They do.  However, what I found INCREDIBLY unbelievable was how Tracy transformed into a bad ass, selfish, mean bitch instantly immediately after meeting Evie.  She didn't evolve into a badass, selfish, mean bitch.  She immediately became one in the scene right after meeting Evie.  One scene she was the sweet, smart 'nerdy' girl, the VERY NEXT SCENE she was the selfish angry bitch.  The transformation just wasn't shown.  Also, I felt the bulk of the movie was trying to shock us by constantly one-upping the stakes and shocking us.  The two things that show the movie's true intentions of shocking us is (1)the movie's opening scene which has absolutely NO reason to open the movie and (2) the provocative poster showing the girls' tongue rings. However, I thought it was a promising performance by Evan Rachel Wood.  While it is impressive that she co-wrote a screenplay at such a young age, Nikki Reed's performance is nothing special.  On the other hand, Holly Hunter gives perhaps her best performance ever as Tracey's mother.  And I thought the final few minutes were very true and heartfelt- it almost made me think I liked the entire movie.   I know no-one will agree with me, because it seems like everyone either LOVES the movie or HATES it, but I thought 'thirteen' was a fair movie with a few very good aspects.",2003

1,"Tolstoy once said that all dysfunctional families are different, and all happy families are the same.  Then again, it might be the other way around -- I'm not sure, I can't remember and I don't care (neither do you.)  As THIRTEEN (the new film which, in the words of my thirteen year-old little nephew, we're all supposed to go ""oooh oooh"" about) wishes to stress that all dysfunctional families ARE the same.  THIRTEEN may have a lot of heart, but that's it's problem.  It's nothing but heart, and has very little [sympathy] for its supposed hero.  If I'm not mistaken, this film was written by a thirteen year-old; it's called thirteen; and it's about thirteen year-olds -- this makes it unique - a film experiment of sorts. In fact, when I heard about it in all the ""thinking man's"" magazines, not much attention was paid to the quality.  It reminds me of the fifteen year-old writer I read about in the Times, who had his first novel published on a whim by some stupid publisher.  The content and quality are irrelevant, the fact that a thirteen year-old girl can write a screenplay is so astonishing (to some) that the movie is instantly garners some attention.  And, I will grudgingly admit, it deserves it.  This is the first movie to (sort of) address jailbait, or underage girls who are sexually active.  Although their exploits do not reach far beyond sucking off the occasional brown-skinned fellow (which was a strange choice by the writers, but makes sense in its own little way) the sexual encounters are well executed, but everything else in the movie is stilted, and unrealistic.  The first thing in the film that not only surprised, but genuinely upset me, is that Rachael is not a depressed character, yet she cuts herself and lashes out at her recovering drug-addict mother with venom.  She's an empty vessel, a dimensionless character -- a large, clean dinner plate encompassing  every teen ""issue"" on the menu.  Whereas most sad, little girls mutilate themselves because (according to some ""experts"") the healing of the cuts makes them happy, echoing the purgation of inner pain -- Rachael is an afterschool special; every ""Lifestories: Families in Crisis"" character ever.  The ""dysfunctional family"" scenes are so hokey, they're comical (such as Rachael and her brother, Mason, playing tug-of-war with a broom) and the fact that we view them through lame director Catherine Hardwicke's use of the dutch-angle shot and shake and bake-cam packs all the more pulled punches.  The idea that a thirteen year-old could write a screenplay does not baffle me.  I recently saw a film called ""White Oleander"" with an equally clumsy narrative structure, which was written by an adult (who probably has a PHD in pap) and you wouldn't know it was about a dysfunctional family if you didn't see the trailer.  The thirteen year-old white girls who dress like gucci models, dance to hip-hop music and scream for joy at the thought of hooking up with the ""hot guy"" at their school; Rachael goes ""yesss!"" and starts dancing when the most popular girl in school invites her to hang -- these are a few ""real"" moments in the movie that are gone about terribly by the writers and director.  Another example is the implicit reference to the fact that Rachael feels obligated to ""keep the change,"" as they say, the first time she performs oral sex on a man.  I feel like I'm going against everything I believe in as a film critic in saying this, but this is one of those films that doesn't rely on craft, but gets an unhealthy dose of it from the director.  Don't see it, I suggest Heavenly Creatures which it is almost identical to in every way, and far superior by traditional film/literary standards.",2004
10,"I've saw this movie like 2 times. I'me 17 now and the second time I saw it was a few days ago; the first time I saw it, I was 13 or 14. At the first view, this movie seemed to me like a bag of sh*t and totally unrealistic. Later, at the second view of this movie, my perspective changed...Having been able to surpass a lot of stuff and to try a bunch of things that seemed tempting at this age made me see that this movie wasn't at all unrealistic. Watching this movie was like seeing my own story put on TV, on fast forward and with some ""ingredients"" and sequences missing (unfortunately major sequences). I found myself in Nikki Reed's character, Evie Zamora and found my best friend in Evan Rachel Wood's. It seemed sad for me to realise that doing all the stuff I did and thought was good, was so wrong but I just couldn't stop...It ws the addiction holding me there and I didn't quite realise that I was ruining my best friend's life...well actually, I didn't quite care, nor did I know. Anyway, the point I'm trying to make is that even though I paid my dues, I'm conscious of the fact that this movie is no generalisation. There are few kids that pass through this situation - for instance I'm known for doing what I did back then and I'm like an exception - and the most important, all the sh*t they talk about in the movie doesn't take place in one year nor does it come up at once. The age of 13 is just a starting point but it's not the time when you do all bad things. Fot instance, even when I was 14 and 15 I didn't realise I was doing something bad; I'm not quite the ""Little Miss Perfect"" now either. Anyway, I see an excuse to clogging up so many things and so much action in such a short period: the movie had to depict the essential problems of teenager (though it doesn't depict all...). As a conclusion, I think this movie is worth seeing because it's educational and it should be seen especially by parents.",2007
10,"Season 1-3 are the best television I've ever seen hands down, although they are a bit of an acquired taste. Many people take against the graphic violence and sex of this show, and the stomach churning realistic portrayal of plastic surgery. The show requires a suspension of belief because it covers such a wide variety of depraved and twisted issues that you just kinda have to go with it, but if you do, it's well worth the ride.",2010
7,"It's sad to watch one of the best series in television self-destruct, but that's what has happened to NIP / TUCK over the last three seasons. Season One contained some of the finest moments in television history. While not as good, Season Two had many memorable moments. Even Seasons Three and Four had worthwhile performances. However, by Season Six, all of the main characters are so decadent, they've become unpleasant and, worse, boring. Christian, while always dis-likable, at least had some interesting demons. Sean, on the other hand, has become a whiny pedophile. Julia, the weakest of the leads, has now become a caricature, as has Matt. Sad to watch, but thanks for the memories. Also, PLEASE GO BACK TO Miami!!!",2008
5,"After watching the first few episodes, I was instantly hooked. ""Nip/Tuck"" was witty, full of black humor and it treated every character with the utmost respect. However, after the third season, it became clear the show's going downhill. Like so many other series (""The Riches"", ""Dead Like Me"", ""Bad Girls"", ""Lost"", ""Prison Break"" being some of them) ""Nip/Tuck"" completely looses it's edge. Why? It was going so well! Maybe they should have ended it after the third season instead of dragging it to the point where it's no longer watchable. My advice: watch the first three seasons, which are a perfect ten. Even season 4 is passable, but anything after that is plain sad and you WILL be disappointed.",2011
10,I come home back from college and I'm already turning the TV on. It's nip/tuck on FOXlife (here in Brazil).,2008
1,"For years friends expressed amazement that I had never watched ""Nip/Tuck"" -- just my kind of show, they insisted. And so, spurred by the recent assault of pre-season publicity, I decided to pay a first-time visit to Nip/Tuck last night. I was expecting sly and witty satire. What I found instead (in repeat episodes that focused on a serial mangler and a deranged racist) was a puerile, unrelenting torrent of violence and sadism. Robotic and/or hysterical acting, moronic plot contortions, and enough deep shadow (in Miami, yet) to make Edgar Ulmer spin like a top. It was like watching Joel Schumacher direct Ricky Martin as Hannibal Lecter. Nice to know what my friends think of my taste.",2006
10,"Nip/tuck's greatest irony lies not within its vast web of lies, deception, cruelty, satire, and tragedy, but within the fact that most of the show's fans have completely missed the point. This show, along with The Shield, is one of the most challenging pieces of art ever crafted. The creators of the show are wise enough to understand that most will interpret the show as a glorification of sex, desire, selfishness, etc. For those reasons, viewers will either love or despise the show. But both parties are wrong. Nip/tuck is a satire of superficiality and a thoughtful portrait of human misbehavior and its damaging results. But unlike the so-called ""insightful"" attitudes of most satires, this series is subtle in its commentary. So subtle, in fact, that at times it seems to be promoting superficial beauty and selfishness. But underneath all of this, there is a cosmic layer of feeling and emotion that I cannot describe in words. Throughout all of the wickedness and absurdity of the events depicted in Nip/tuck, I realized that I deeply care about the characters. They have become more real to me than some actual people I know. This series could have easily been just another medical show or even trashy pornography, but it cuts too deep and sees far too much honest pain for that to be the case. It is a brilliant series and I recommend to those with the stomach for it.",2008
9,I've been hooked on this show for the past 2 months. I've watched the first 3 seasons on DVD (im writing this review right before watching the season 3 finale).,2007
7,"Original script,unexpected developments and very good acting is something that is positive in this series.The place where everything happens is South Beach,Miami.This one ""cuts"" deep under the surface of the plastic surgery world and dramatically discovers fragile nature of the patience's who are trying to hide their flaws by going on expensive surgeries.",2007
10,"Nip/Tuck is one of the best shows on TV. The story is deep and there are plenty of twists and turns. The show is about two plastic surgeons, Christian Troy played by Julian Mcmahon and Sean McNamara played by Dylan Walsh, and their lives. Christian Troy is the type of person who looks out for himself, and wants the best life he can get. Sean McNamara is more of the family man, who really stresses out at times. Dylan Walsh did a great job as a Sean, he really makes Sean realistic. This show is amazing, and if you have FX I highly recommend you watch this.Ryan Murphy did a great job inventing this show, its much better than most of the stuff that comes on nowadays.",2006
10,"This could be a Spoiler, so please, if you haven't watched season 2 then stop reading now.",2006
10,"Personally, i think no other show can top Nip/tuck. with all the great characters to come together and make a great cast, the great story line, and the great atmosphere on the show really makes it a classic. i love it, and would die without it. as the carver says, beauty is a curse on the world. i recommend everybody watch this show, because you will not be disappointed! it is now coming back in its 4rth season September 5th, and if you haven't seen the others, they are out on DVD now! GO OUT AND BUY! i give this show a 10 out of 10, and give it the name of, a Disturbingly perfect drama. so once again, a perfect 10, and Lady's and gentlemen, do yourself a favor, go out and get it, NOW!",2006
3,"I honestly don't understand all those positive reviews. This gotta be one of the worst series of all time in my book. Is there any cliché left they didn't do? Come on, we've seen it all before. I gotta give them credit for the operations scenes but that's all that is good with this show. Their effort to present this as something cool and fresh is pathetic. If you wanna see some quality drama with humor go for ""Six feet under"" and not this. I've watched four season of this and it only gets worse. It's obvious that this show has big budget and it's evident in every scene, it's too bad that that's the only thing they have cause the story is trying so hard to be provocative that it gets irritating. The characters and screenplay are your typical American soap opera cliché after cliché thing. There's no doubt that the cast has some really good actors but their skills are lost with such a poor screenplay. I don't know, maybe you have to be American to actually like this (not meant to offend, it's just different culture and state of mind than European) but I have yet to find someone I know that actually like this show. But I guess users here are exception. I understand that everyone is entitled to their own opinion and that a lot of people like this show but I'm writing this review to show that there's the other side too and that we don't all think this is such a brilliant show but poor, and lousy attempt to shock and nothing else. Superficial as their characters. If you wanna see show that will make you laugh, that will make you think, that will touch you in any way DON'T watch Nip/Tuck. If you wanna see dumb entertainment that is popular today, pathetic excuse for a characters and story, Christian Troy's ass in every episode and some gross but rather impressive surgical scenes than this show is great for you.",2007
8,This movie totally surprised me on every level. I had never even heard of it until recently; when an observant video store clerk noticed how many thrillers I was hiring and suggested it. ,2007
9,I've never before seen a film that made me sit on the edge of my seat practically from the opening credits. And I never got to sit back.,2004
9,"OK, everyone seems to be confused about this movie so let me explain it for everyone. The killer has a multiple personality syndrome, and was being treated in a psychiatric home. They have tapes of him portraying many different personalities, and they believe that one of his many personalities is the killer. The reason everyone has the same birthday is that every person is really him, all of these characters are made up in this guys mind. The way they figure they can cure him of his multiple personalities is to have them all come together inside of his head and hopefully they will all be killed off, with the risk that the killer will be one of the personalities killed. Let me repeat, the point of that motel, is to have all the personalities come together hoping that they will all die except for one, that one takes control of his life. As each character dies, that is one less personality he has left. In the very end they think he is OK because all of his personalities are dead, except for the girl. But really that kid is still alive, and he kills Amanda Peet. The exercise that they tried to do was complete, all the personalities died inside of his head, unfortunately the only personality that survived was the one that was the killer. I hope that clears it up a little bit.",2005
8,"Because of what seem to be unusual circumstances, eleven people, strangers to each other outside of their respective ""groups"" (two families, two professional associations), end up stranded in a desolate Nevada motel on a dark, stormy night. One of the ""strangers"" is a death row murderer being escorted to another prison for execution. When bodies start turning up and the murderer goes missing, he's the obvious suspect. But things are not what they seem. Identity provides a ""double mystery""--a traditional whodunit and an increasingly bizarre ""rubber reality"" mystery that we must figure out along with the characters.",2005
10,To be honest I didnt want to watch this movie but it was my wifes turn to choose so I had no choice. After 20 minuites into the movie I was so glad it wasnt my turn to choose. This movie was absolutely fantastic. The Premise as you will read here on IMDB or on the back of the dvd in the shop/rental store seemed very lame to me but I was so wrong.,2004
10,"For a start,i would like to say that this film is worth seeing.It is one of the best psychological thrillers that exist so i highly recommend to those who like this kind of movies.The plot was very nice,the twist also and the cast outstanding.Cusack,Liotta,Peet and Hawkes did their best and the result was excellent.I liked a lot the flashbacks that were made -mostly in the beginning. Furthermore,the idea of the whole film was terrific.On the other hand,speaking frankly there was an excessive gore and emphasis on the murders that didn't impress me;a big part of the movie was ""dedicated"" to murders.Another thing that i didn't like was the continuous rain that made me feel tired,seeing again again the storm. Moreover,what i liked most-contrary to many people- was the end of the movie.It was unpredictable and,besides that,it is one of the few thrillers that you cannot find out the end easily.It was very interesting and made me sit tight on my couch .If you don't pay attention for a while you will ""get lost"". I should not forget to refer to the hot presence of Peer that embellished the movie apart from her casting abilities. Lastly,you should make sure that you will be 100% concentrated on the film in order to understand what is happening cause i regard it as one of the most difficult movies to understand.It is certain that this film will dominate you with mystery and in parallel make you think a lot of things that will be predicted wrong in the end. I would give 9 -at least- out of 10 to Identity.",2005
10,Let me tell you that I will give away nothing about the plot in this review and no spoilers will be included.,2003
9,"Today I have watched ""Identity"" for the second time in less than two months, now on DVD. Again, I found it an excellent and intriguing film. There are two versions in the DVD, and I selected the one with scenes that were cut in the final edition (the other option was the theatrical version). Now I paid more attention on the details of the plot, trying to identify flaws in the screenplay, but the story is very tight. There are many extras in the DVD, including deleted scenes, making of, filmography, comments etc. It is amazing the filmography of John Cusack, composed mainly of good movies. I keep my initial vote (nine).",2004
10,Story genre: a thriller which borders on the lines of a horror movie,2004
10,"Seeing the plot and reviews at IMDb,i decided to see this movie . It is one of the best mystery movies which keeps you at the edge of your seat until the last moment when you are baffled . If you are a suspense movie lover , you cannot miss this one . It is one of the best well written plot and the characters though not that famous (apart from John Cusack) still they glue well with this plot. ------ ""When I was going up the stairs , ",2010
10,"SPOILER - Now knowing the ending I find it so clever that the whole movie takes place in a motel and each character has a different room. Even sane people have many different aspects to their personality, but they don't let them become dominant -- they are controlled. Malcolm's various personalities and needs were personified in each character. The prostitute mother (Amanda Peet), the part of him who hated her for being a prostitute (Larry), the loving mother he wish he had, the loving father he wish he had, the selfish part of himself (actress), the violent part of his personality (Ray Liotta and Busey), the irrational emotions he feels and his need to be loved (Ginnie) and his attempts to control those feelings (Lou), the hurt little boy who sees far too many traumatic things in his life, and of course, John Cusack who seems to represent Malcolm himself trying to analyze and understand all the craziness in his mind, tries to follow the rules (accepting responsibility for the car accident), help others (giving Amanda Peet a ride, and stitching up the mother). Very cleverly done!",2003
8,On a dark and stormy night 11 strangers have to take refuge in an isolated motel when a rainstorm turns into a monsoon.  One by one they begin to be killed...but by who and for what reason?,2003
7,"Identity is not a horror flick. This is a mix of several genres, from thriller, to mystery, a who'dunnit with gore. But still a very surprising movie. Normally I don't respond well to movies who lie to the audience, who show a whole story and suddenly, in the end, without warning just say ""oh well, after all it was nothing like that at all, the guy was just asleep!"". Hitchcock once said you should never lie to an audience, you should never show something that isn't true. It's one thing to tell a lie in a movie, the other is to show it to the audience as if it was the real thing. It's the easiest trick in the book, of course you'll be surprised, anybody will. To understand it better see the difference between ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""Seven"". The first shows a story that wasn't there and in the end pulls a rabbit out of the hat(easy!). The other builds up to an explosive and unexpected finale without any cheap shots, it just carries you through. With Identity the movie suddenly pulls a fast one on you and leaves you wondering... But Mangold doesn't gives the twist at the very end, and keeps a tense film until the last frame. It's a worth see, inventive film and with a great cast to back it up.",2003
10,"Identity is a very thrilling and spooky film! The all star cast performed very well especially Ray Liotta, John C. McGinley, Amanda Peet, Jake Busey, Pruitt Taylor Vince, and John Cusak! The music by Alan Silvestri was good. The film is a little hard to understand so it not predictable! If you want to watch a horror, a mystery, a action, and a murder film then see Identity today because it has all of that in it!",2003
1,"""Identity"" is yet another movie that thinks a ""SHOCKING TWIST"" is better than a good narrative.  I have had it up to here with movies that continue to play the ol' ""pull the rug out from under the audience"" trick when the ONLY purpose behind it is for the sake of the twist/shock itself.",2003

See this movie only to see how well a thriller can be done, and how important it is not to go the cheap way and go for a big shock, that destroys characters rather than makes your jaw drop in awe. This is a film that could've been brilliant if the writers of the script had used their brains.",2004

John Cusack as Ed gives his usual completely professional performance. I don't think this bloke has ever made a bad movie. Like ""Mulholland Drive"" I didn't have a clue what it was all about when I walked out of the theatre. I'm just staring to work it out now, two days later. (""Mulholland Drive"" I've still got to work out)  This is 21st century cinema noir! Don't miss it!",2003

8,"I often find that in order to be captivating, a film these days needs to be stressfully suspenseful or have a complicated story line. This film had neither, and yet I found myself hoping it wouldn't end while at the same time, anxiously awaiting its conclusion. I have to admit, I was distrustful of Burton as many of his more recent films have had less-than-satisfying conclusions. Nonetheless, I went to see Big Fish (3 days before its release in Canada) with no expectations and was astounded. This movie is an absolute treat for our hearts, ears and especially our eyes with each cartoon/fantasy-like scene painted with Tim Burton's reliable brilliance and magical touch. Ewan McGregor is pure sunshine and Albert Finney gives one of the greatest performances of the year- he *is* Big Fish. But I suppose that when you strip away the beauty, the doll-house sets and all the abracadabra of cinematography and modern day technology, all you have is a very simple story, and therein lies the heart of this film; that one can create their own legacy, ""the story of my life."" Not through either extreme of extraordinary adventure or unbelievable lies, but through the art of storytelling- and THAT is what this film is about. It is through our *stories* that we are immortal.",2003
10,"I approach Tim Burton films with a certain trepidation.  Will it be ""Edward Scissorhands"" or ""Batman II?""  With Burton you could get a quirky comedy, a dark thriller, or sweet morality tale.  And there's always the possibility of Danny DeVito chomping down on a raw fish.",2004

Venturesome as though he may be, Ed Bloom leaves his Mayberry, joins the circus, and decides to fall in love...True love comes along less than once in a lifetime...The intuition for true love in this movie is succinctly illustrated through a dark angled idealism, and suddenly, problems with falling in love are romanticized by a myriad of quirky determination patterns, as well as utterly human shortcomings!!. Married, having a son, a house, etc, etc, etc and so on and so on and so on and so forth and so forth and so forth, pans out to whereby his emeritus years become those of expounding dissertation about his exciting dare devil nefarious life as an impervious adolescent.. Spinning Yarns? We know better!!...Try telling his son that...Too incredible!! Too spectacular!! Too heroic!!...Ed Bloom's blindly motivational love and devotion towards the woman he cherishes, makes Romeo and Juliet's relationship seem platonic...

Can you ask for a stronger conclusion than what we are offered at the end of this? The end ties together everything perfectly, going all the way back to the beginning of the movie! I mean, the fact that we finally get to see what was in the witch's eye (regardless of the fact that it was all made up) is reward enough. Not to mention that we find out throughout the last bit of the movie that not EVERYTHING Edward Bloom told was a lie. All I can say is, the beginning and ending lines about the fish really tie the movie together, despite a few comments from non-fish lovers!!",2007
6,"Many people have said how great they found this film, personally it didn't really do it for me.",2005
10,This is one of the 10 best movies I've ever seen.,2005
1,"Tim Burton has made a number of films I really like (Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, Pee Wee's Big Adventure), but this is not one of them.  The son trying to figure out his father is a wholly unlikable character.  If I were his dad, I'd disown him.  Like everyone else in the picture, he is successful, very clean cut, and middle class.  In fact, these words can be used to describe the film in its entirety, and I don't mean that as a compliment.  ",2004
2,"I have to start this by saying that Tim Burton has always been one of my favorite directors. I like his skewed point of view, his Edward Gorey-ish surrealism, his way he will show the not merely odd in his films but also the unpleasant, the ugly, and the weirdly bizarre, and show them in a lovable, accepting manner that makes them sometimes hauntingly fascinating. Instead of that ""train wreck you can't look away from"" feeling, Burton always leaves you with a voyeuristic sense that makes you want to watch his films more than once, to see the things you missed the first time. Instead of hammering away at the viewer with the weirdness of the characters, Burton lets the personalities speak for themselves; and perhaps this works because his characters have always been inherently likeable.",2004
9,"My father was a brilliant sculptor and a great visionary. When I was a kid, I never could explain what he was doing. I got it a month before his death when i was 26. This film filled my eyes with tears, because it reminded me him. he had a lot of ideas and brilliant and original ideas for improving the world, but for all his life he could not sell it to anyone, because those ideas filled his whole day. Literally. His whole apartment was filled with papers. Thank you for this movie. Thank you for the message. I would add a note that when we dream, we are escaping from the world of facts and truths. When my father said that if you think of anything in life, you have to write it down because what comes to your mind it never comes again it changed my life. Now I'm writing a book - a novel from environment of Mesopotamia and that just because my father was someone who believed in imagination and creative values​​.",2013
10,"Director Tim Burton is notorious for his inventive, unique brand(s) of images he puts into his films, and a style that seems to regenerate in each film he does (though not always successfully- Planet of the Apes proved that).  Now there's Big Fish, a film loaded with visual spectacle, and it shows Burton working an adaptation to his own advantage for the first time in years.  Here he tells a story about storytelling, using both make-up, sets, and CGI at his disposal, and it's about one man's own imagination and how he carried it on to others, whether they were delighted by the tall tales or not.",2003

1,"A really unfortunate waste of a film, chock full of contrived, manipulative, false-sentimentality that would almost, but not quite, make Spielberg blush. Okay, that sounds a bit harsh, but this is bland, un-affecting Hollywood tripe. Burton doesn't insult his audience's emotional intelligence to the Spielbergian degree, but nor does he inspire us the way he once did my sharing his unique vision. This film has the emotional subtlety of a jack-hammer and it contains none of the imaginative wonder of 'Beetlejuice' or 'A Nightmare Before Chritmas.' Sadly, this is what Hollywood/Middle Age can do to a former bright light. The kind of movie that guy from 'Good Morning America' would call 'loads of fun' in one of his lobotomized reviews. Skip it.

I don't cry when I see money movies, the last movie I saw that made me cry was Pay It Forward. (hey come on the ending was a heart breaker) But this film just had little moments of sadness that made me shed a tear and a handful of happy moments that made me cry like a baby.

9,The Matrix Reloaded (2003) is the greatest action movie of all time and a good sequel to the original The Matrix (1999) that I went to see it with my mom in the movie theater in 1999 when the movie come out. I love this movie even if some people are saying is not that good I still love it and love The Matrix Revolutions as well. It is one of my personal favorite Keanue Reeves movies. ,2015
9,"Watching The Matrix Reloaded, one is absolutely entitled to say that it is overloaded, too lengthy action sequences for instance, and indeed, a way too lengthy dancing scene in Zion. But next to that, it is obvious that this sequal to The Matrix (1999)takes the story to a whole new dimension. Different characters define the working of the matrix, and the meaning of life itself, in different ways, depending on their onthological background. A conclusion is not (yet) given, which adds to the movie a kind of postmodern quality. For as far as the action sequences are concerned: Groundbreaking. You'll see stuff that you've never seen before. Sometimes the scenes are a little lengthy, which harmes the narrative, but that is compensated easily by the visual spectacle. And yes, the Architect at the end is difficult to understand, but when you watch the film more than once, you'll find out that it does make sense what he says. All together this movie may not be as fantastic as 'The Matrix', but it is definitely a good movie that will keep you thinking for a while.",2004
8,The Matrix Reloaded has everything you could possibly want from a summer blockbuster but it like its predecessor has a heck of a lot more and while Reloaded is not as good as the first Matrix film it sure is close to the standard of the original. I don't understand the seeming reluctance to accept this film a suitable continuation of the original film. I'll be the first one to admit that Reloaded has a few slow points and that the story line has a tendency towards the pretentious but the film is also highly intelligent and entertaining but most importantly the film gets the story from A to B with adequate and in some cases remarkable character development.,2006

People in the theater also laughed at the overdone scenes that were very very long. The key maker part of the story was so incredibly pathetic. It somehow reminded me of some of Spielberg's worst movies from the 80's (Indiana Jones 2). Anyway, If you like computer games, go see it.

5,"During one University Class on Film Violence our tutor went around class asking the students to nominate a film where we felt the violence was unrealistic . My nomination was the Randall Wallace debacle WE WERE SOLDIERS down to the fact every time an American was killed there was always enough time for the dying soldier to make a short speech as to how much he loved his wife/mom /pet dog . One of the other students , a young lad called Ivan , nominated the battle between Neo and the multiple Mr Smiths' from THE MATRIX RELOADED . I remember thinking it was a rather good nomination since it seemed to go on far longer than needed and that Neo could have escaped the fight anytime he wanted . Having recently seen the film again I have to say it's a brilliantly obvious nomination since the sequence is ridiculous and unconvincing as is the whole movie ",2010
1,"Man would expect that a movie shot with an approx. budget of 300,000,000 U$D should at least entertain you for the time you are spending in the cinema actally watching it. ""Matrix Reloaded"" proves this assumption wrong.",2003
1,1/10 and that's only because I don't go lower with my ratings.,2003
1,"The first Matrix movie was lush with incredible character development, witty dialog, and action scenes that kept with the flow of the story. These elements -- coupled by incredible special effects of the day -- presented a magical ride that kept you in suspense the entire time. Enter Matrix Reloaded (and its sequel, Revolutions). The problem here isn't the special effects or the fight sequences as some may argue; The brothers have taken well-developed characters from the first film and hollowed them out like rotten tree logs. The connection that was first established between viewers and on-screen characters in the first film is lost when you realize these are not the same characters from the first Matrix movie.",2007
2,Spoilers of both this and The Matrix follow.,2003
10,"The thing that really strikes me about The Matrix Reloaded is that the increase in quality, if it can be said that there actually is one, from the first movie is more the result of an increased budget than anything else. I loved the new movie, but the talent was there in the first one, you can just tell that in the sequel the Wachowski brothers had a virtually endless budget, which allowed them to do pretty much anything they wanted. They have a very distinct style that is clearly evident in all of their movies, even if they are not laden with special effects. The fluidity of the camera movement and the strangely dark tones of their films are only a couple of the techniques that make them recognizable. These things really come to the surface if you watch the Matrix films, some of the most recognizable films ever made, and then watch an earlier one of their movies, like the trashy 1996 thriller, Bound.",2003
3,When I watched The Matrix I really liked it. It was not the best film in my life but it was interesting and twisted. I think the best in The Matrix was the SURPRISE factor. So when Matrix Reloaded was released I went to the theater with high expectations.,2006
1,"I was 11 when the first Star Wars movie came out. I wasn't mature enough to appreciate Harrison Ford's space-cowboy smirk or Carrie Fischer's sarcasm, much less the swagger of their respective deliveries. All I cared about was robots blasting other robots.",2006
9,"Being a casual fan of the original The Matrix, I was looking forward to seeing The Matrix:Reloaded in the theaters. However, I was not quite ready to line up at the door donned in a Neo costume for a midnight showing on opening day. Having seen Reloaded, I can now say that I may be one of those people (sans the Neo costume) when The Matrix:Revolutions is released this winter. I cannot say that I think that Reloaded was as good as the original. Yes, it contained more action. Yes, the special effects were better. Yes, both the plot and the dialogue were more intricate and at times more head scratching. But Reloaded lacks what its predecessor had, the element of complete surprise. The wool has already been removed from our eyes. We know what the Matrix is. I cannot think of any plot twist that will be able to match what happens when Neo swallows the Red Pill. All that being said, after seeing Reloaded, I now appreciate the story as a whole. The Matrix and The Matrix:Reloaded when viewed as one complete story far surpasses viewing each as it's own single entity. While the original had mildly peaked my interest, I am now fully enthralled by the entire mythology of The Matrix (I highly recommend viewing the back stories available online on the Animatrix). Much like The Lord of the Rings series, I can no longer imagine The Matrix without contemplating Reloaded. As for Reloaded as a movie itself, the fight scenes are amazingly choreographed, though sometimes a little excessive. I would recommend the movie for the fight with the multiple Agent Smiths alone, as it is a phenomenally staged battle. My criticism lies mostly in the editing. This is a movie that could have definitely been shorter. Many scenes were unnecessarily long, such as the dance orgy after Morpheus' speech, or flat out unnecessary, such as Neo's fight with Seraph. But beyond the flashy fight scenes and special effects, its strength lies in the most unlikely (to me at least) of places, its story. It is a movie full of philosophical questions and religious allusions. The end scene with the Architect in and of itself warrants a second viewing, as it is quite a bit to wrap the brain around. And the way it handles its main theme is done exquisitely. What is reality? Is the ""real world"" just another part of the Matrix? Is Neo The One? All questions I will be asking as I stand in line for the midnight opening of The Matrix:Revolutions.",2003
10,"I thought this one is better than The Matrix (1999). More Action, More Love, More Biblical References, More Matrix. More Matrix is better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! When I saw this movie in the theaters I was amazed by the amount of action that was fit into a 2 Hours and 18 min film. The stakes are raised higher! A film like this ONE dosen't come along very often!! I hope The Matrix Revolutions (2003) is just as good.",2003

10,"I can't say anything good enough about this movie.  It had it ALL!  Love, action, effects, and a great plot make this movie a serious hit for whatever genre you're looking for in a movie (it was for me, at least).  All i can really say is watch this movie and do yourself a favor.  It's the best film in a long time.  I seriously thought I wouldn't be surprised much after seeing and loving the original movie for this series.  The first had great shock and awe; with its great plot.  BUt this one was just as awesome and it DID take me by surprise.  I can't say it enough.  SEE THIS FILM!  You won't be disappointed.",2003
9,"Anthony Minghela's (writer/director) Cold Mountain is a carefully constructed, sensitive, and intelligent drama set in the social context of the confederacy during the civil war. It deals with the politics of the war in a very subtle and realistic manner. While it accurately depicts the brutality and inhumanity of that war, it also does something that many films related to this period do not handle effectively - Cold Mountain studies the southern context from the inside out, and portrays changes among the non-slave owning common people wrought by the war. Almost uniquely, Cold Mountain does not over-generalize southerners, northerners or anybody else.",2007
8,"'War movie' is a Hollywood genre that has been done and redone so many times that clichéd dialogue, rehashed plot and over-the-top action sequences seem unavoidable for any conflict dealing with large-scale combat. Once in a while, however, a war movie comes along that goes against the grain and brings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen. The Civil War-era ""Cold Mountain,"" starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Renée Zellweger is such a film.",2005
10,"This movie moved me more than I was expecting, and I was fully prepared to cry. The acting mainly carried this film, with superb performances from Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Renee Zellweger, as well as the supporting cast. These actors portrayed characters so intensely human that they lingered the remainder of the night with me, and I had trouble shaking this war drama. The costumes and cinematography were also magical, but didn't get carried away with themselves. They didn't take focus, but added to the whole effect. Cold Mountain could never become my favorite movie, as that title will always belong to The English Patient, but it's in the top five. The story itself was well developed, and stayed fairly unpredictable. I did not find myself guessing what line came next. A heart-wrenching story about humanity and war. In fact, this movie was so strongly real that it was barely noticeable it took place in the 19th century. It seemed to apply to all times.",2005
9,"In Cold Mountain, North Colorado, near to the period of the American Civil War, the Reverend Monroe (Donald Sutherland) arrives in the small town with his daughter, the shy Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman), due to health reasons. Ada meets the also shy Inman (Jude Law), and they fall in love with each other. With the beginning of the war, Inman becomes a soldier, and his great support to stay alive is the wish to see Ada in Cold Mountain again. Meanwhile, Ada meets Ruby Thewes (Renée Zellweger), a survivor of the war, who helps her in the farm and becomes her best friend. The story alternates present and past situations, disclosing a beautiful romance. I liked this film a lot. Having names such as Philip Seymour Hoffman, Natalie Portman and Giovanni Ribisi in the supporting cast, a magnificent direction of Anthony Minghella and seven indications to the Oscar, this movie does not disappoint. My remark is that there are some very important scenes deleted in the story and presented in the DVD. At least one of them, which show what happens with Sara, her baby and the three dead bodies in her farm, should not be deleted as it was. My vote is nine.",2004
2,"When I first saw the trailors for this movie, I was overjoyed. Anthony Minghella is one of my favorite directors. His English Patient has always captured my imagination and moved me deeply. The actors in this movie were some of my favorite. Jude Law and especially Nicole Kidman, whose last year's performance in The Hours shocked me with her undertone of power. And with a cast of amazing supporting actors, including the likes of Phillip Seymor Hoffman and Giovanni Rabissi. How could anyone not love this movie? Simple, it was sold to you. You were not expected to buy it or believe. It was a bad soap opera on wheels rolling into a ravine. True, this movie had its moments. But that is all it had moments of average filming that swept you away for a second. Yet, you were brought back quickly by the stereotypes of the film. The one that bothered me the most about this film was its love story. Contrived, that is all I can say. I am an avid movie fan and am usually quicker to love movies than to hate, but this rubbed me the wrong way.",2004
5,"Loosely based on Homer's 'Odyssey', 'Cold Mountain' tells the story of the final days of the American Civil War, and one man's struggle to get home. Unfortunately, it's also a world where the heroes, even when supposedly starving, have 21st century muscles, and the heroines all have 21st century teeth. More than that, they have 21st century values as well: I'm not saying that all southerners were slave-owning bigots, but the film establishes very early on where it's coming from, where the hero shows, in the very first scene, what was surely very unusual courtesy from a southerner to a black man, while shortly afterwards the heroine declares her happiness to be away from slaves, though without specifying the nature of her objection. Which means, of course, that the film offers no insights into how white people, viewed as having the highest moral character in their own community, could have fought a war ultimately for the purpose of the right to enslave others. Meanwhile, the various foes who stand in the path of a happy ending are all depicted as evil and venal, in contrast to the nobility and modernity of the sympathetic characters. This is less history than 'The Lord of the Rings'; where moral merit is not a judgement passed on a set of behaviours in a particular environment, but rather an innate property of the good and the beautiful.",2014
1,"Did you people watch the same movie that I did???? It was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. To begin with Nicole Kidman's heavy makeup in the beginning of the movie would probably have had her branded as a prostitute in those days. Also, she was miscast and her acting was terrible. Jude Law tried, but again he along with the rest of the (mis)cast never evoked any emotion in me. Rene Zelweiger's acting was convincing, but reminiscent of Granny Clampett in the Beverly Hillbillies. The characters were one dimensional and even Natalie Portman's scene did little to arouse any emotion in me. Donald Sutherland was the best actor in the movie and he was gone during the first half hour!! The script was terrible and laden with clichés from the characters to the dialogue. Even when Inman and Ada meet again, a scene that shouldn't leave a dry eye in the house, it left me cold, as did his death at the end. I just didn't care because these characters and actors never invited me into their world. If you want to see a movie with good acting and a realistic view of the Civil War stick to Glory or Gone with the Wind. Don't waste your time on this sterile tale.",2010

Scarlett fights and connives for what she wants; Ada gets depressed and turns inside herself until Ruby, (Renee Zellweger,) shows up to save the day. Sort of, in a round about way. Deserters instead of officers trying to get back to their families, the lists goes on and on. Even the love story was opposite. If this is what the producer and writers were trying to get across it succeeded with me. ",2004
2,"The Civil War was a horror, but this movie seems to take prurient delight in blood, body parts and lots of grisly bits of gore.  What makes this even more irritating is the fact that the acting is so strong, that the audience would have understood the horrors of war so much better if the director had allowed the actors to do their work.  I can't blame the director for the ending, that's the author's contrivance, but that's what it is, utterly predictable, hokey and contrived.  The script at best is an excuse to allow a whole bunch of fine actors do some thankless, but brilliant character work.",2004

Horribly staged battle scenes, laughable dialogue, generic southern accents, and a story-line that would make the writers of daytime TV hide for shame.

I don't fit any any of those classification. The other classification that needs to be on the list is 5) people didn't like this movie because it was not good. I found the film to be booring and forced. My wife picked it for us to see because she is a huge Kidman fan and she also likes Jude Law.,2004
1,"This movie was so bad, I thought I was going to scream in the middle of it. It was all I could do to sit through it.  The beginning of the movie where they are at war was promising.  Only it smacked of ""Saving Private Ryan"" to me...or at least an attempt at it.  Only we don't care for these people. There was no build up to the characters.  The kid that dies I guess was suppose to make us cry...but for some reason it just irritated everyone.  Then we have to listen to line after line of sappy dialog that tried desperately to mimic ""Wuthering Heights"", which of course was also quoted in the movie.  Go figure.  There was nothing original about the movie at all, it was like sitting through the most mundane parts of every war movie ever made, with a little bit of humor thrown in to keep you hoping that it was going to get better.  Sadly it doesn't.  3 hours later, I leave the theater feeling cheated.  Anthony Menghilla should be shot for trying to duplicate the English Patient, which for it's time was a good movie, but now I wonder....should I rent it and make sure I wasn't just caught up in the HYPE???  Maybe I was, but I definitely wasn't caught up in the hype of this film.  I really went to the theater wanting to like this movie.  I am a die hard Nicole Kidman fan.

Every time you get attached to a character in the least, this random band of 5 murderers comes along and kills them. Why didn't somebody just shoot those Home Guard fellas if everybody knew they were just coming around to kill you and rape your family? There was not a single redeeming quality about the plot of this movie. It started out depressing, got more depressing, looked up for 1 day in movie time, then it got REALLY depressing. Living in the South, I've heard stories all my life about how terrible things were back then, about how there was no real government for a long time there, and there were constant murders and lynchings surrounding the war. But this really took that theme to an unbelievable and ridiculous extreme. Don't waste your time, you'll just wind up feeling like all the life got sucked out of you.",2005
1,"Critics are falling over themselves within the Weinstein's Sphere of Influence to praise this ugly, misguided and repellent adaptation of the lyrical novel on which it's based.  Minghella's ham-fisted direction of the egregiously gory and shrill overly-episodic odyssey is one of the many missteps of this ""civil-war love story"".  Are they kidding?  After Ms. Kidman and Mr. Law meet cute with zero screen chemistry in a small North Carolina town and steal a kiss before its off to war for Jude and his photo souvenir of the girl he left behind, it's a two hour test to the kidneys as to whether he will survive a myriad of near-death experiences to reunite with his soulmate. Who cares?  Philip S. Hoffman's amateurish scene chewing in a disgusting and unfunny role pales to Renee Zelweger's appearance as a corn-fed dynamo who bursts miraculously upon the scene of Kidman's lonely farm to save the day.  Rarely has a performance screamed of ""look at me, I'm acting"" smugness.  Her sheer deafening nerve wakes up the longuers for a couple of minutes until the bluster wears painfully thin.  Released by Miramax strategically for Oscar and Golden Globe (what a farce) consideration, the Weinsteins apparently own, along with Dick Clark, the critical community and won 8 Globe nominations for their overblown failure. The resultant crime is that awards have become meaningless and small, less powerful PR-driven films become obscure.  Cold Mountain is a concept film and an empty, bitter waste of time.

Kate carries the day only when she can show her unique mixture of vulnerability and worldly sophistication, which amounts to mere seconds of screen time in this film.  Matthew McConaughey mostly looks confused and waiting for a punchline which I suppose is what the screenwriters intended.  Is there chemistry?

8,"The Italian Job is a real blast to watch. It's a genuinely entertaining film, something you watch just for the sheer enjoyment of it. It's not heavy with drama or emotional hand-wringing, it has no cosmic statements about life, and it's not violent or profane. It's just a fun movie. Between watching the little Mini Coopers fly around the crowded streets of L.A. and the great bits by stereotypical computer geek-turned-crook (played gleefully by Seth Greene), I had a lot of fun watching this film.",2005
7,If you are looking for a film that is quick witted and won't bore you then this is the place.  It is fast paced and funny with some decent acting comeing from the characters.  It is always hard for me to see Mark Walhberg as anything except Marky Mark.  That image is burned in my mind forever.  As an actor though he is pretty good.  This movie is a must see for action fans who like to see a few little twists and turns.  I will have to pick this movie up one day and buy it.,2003
7,"My reaction to this remake of ""The Italian Job"" is probably hopelessly mixed up with the events occurring in my life when I saw it; This is the first movie I saw after I had just landed a job after 8 months of unemployment and going back to school for retraining. Money was still tight, but I no longer had to choose between seeing a movie in the theaters and paying bills (or eating lunch), and the sense of relief and gratitude I was feeling at the time was enormous. In consequence, my enjoyment of ""Italian Job"" was probably far out of proportion to its actual worth. ",2005

9,"I enjoyed the movie very much. Everything in The Italian Job is simple. An explosive guy, a safe-cracker, a computer genius, a wheel-man and a man with a spectacular plan of stealing 35 million without using a gun. This film is entertaining although it has no central idea. It is a non-stop movie with lots of actions. All the stunt work is gorgeous. From the speedboat chase in Venice at the beginning to the chase on the busy roads in Los Angeles involving three mini coopers and even a helicopter. The best boast chase I have ever seen. I like the mini coopers. The expert thieves used mini coopers for the getaway cars. The chase between the mini coopers and the motor-bikes is amazing. They chased underground. I can say there was not a moment I was bored. Mark Wahlberg (Charlie Croker), Charlize Theron (Stella Bridger), Donald Sutherland (John Bridger), Jason Statham (Handsome Rob), Seth Green (Lyle), Mos Def (Left Ear) and Edwin Norton (Steve) really did a good job. I like the actors in this film. I have seen a lot of heist movie but The Italian Job& is one of my favourites. A great Hollywood action movie without a drop of blood. After all, I do love this kind of movie.",2005

Everything that made the original ""Italian Job"" entertaining has been bled out of this festering sore of a movie ""scripted"" by Donna and Wayne Powers and listlessly ""directed"" by F Gary Gray. I am amazed that Troy Kennedy Martin (the screenwriter of the original film) allowed his name to be used in the credits for this pig's ear.

After all, what can be more galling to an Englishman than an American remake of an iconic picture celebrating Little Britain from the swinging Sixties?

Shouldn't that tell you enough?",2004

1,"What was the point of making this movie? I went to see it with friends thinking the stunts might be good, but they were nowhere near as impressive as in the original. The stunt with the helicopter was original, but the rest were yawn-inducing. The script is appalling and the resolution of the relationship between Theron and Wallberg at the end was laughable (I dropped my Coke container in the cinema in shock). It was so obviously tacked on to fit the traditional Hollywood hero-gets-the-girl ending. Jason Steatham had some awful lines to deliver. Whereas the original is very tongue-in-cheek, this was too serious and the little humour in it was weak. What is it with screenwriters today? They think they can fill a script with weak one-liners and we'll all be so happy? Mark Walberg is a terrible actor. He ruined Planet of the Apes too (another poor remake). There was no chemistry between Theron and Walberg at all and them getting together at the end was clumsy and contrived. Donald Sutherland had the right idea by dying early on. He didn't need to suffer the rest of it like we did.",2003
7,"When I heard about a directors cut to this movie I never imagined it would be so much better than the original release. Why must movie studios always feel they know better than the director. This film would have been much more successful had they left it alone, but by insisting on so many cuts and changes they shot themselves in the foot. All because they wanted a family friendly spider-man type film instead of the much more dark and violent world of daredevil. Every scene added to the film makes you wonder why they cut it in the first place. It isn't just about adding scenes though they have taken a couple out too. I can't imagine anyone who would miss the fireside love scene. I urge everyone who saw the theatrical cut to watch the directors cut. It isn't a perfect film but it's a more complete and enjoyable one. Also watch the documentary on the directors cut DVD and see one of the producers trying to defend the original release and then actually saying he thinks it is the better cut. I think he must be more blind than Matt Murdock!!!",2005
9,"This review is for the Director's cut DVD of Daredevil. In all honesty, i liked the theatrical version of this movie. But now that i have seen the true version of this movie, the director's cut, i don't have any desire to watch the theatrical cut ever again. The director's cut is an improvement in every way. Everything makes sense now, and the characters are more fleshed out, which is a very good thing. ",2004
9,"First of all, i was never a reader of the comics, and didn't know much about daredevil before venturing into the cinemas to see the original when it was released. At the time, there wasn't much action out and i like most of Ben Affleck's movies, so though i would give it a go. Although i liked the theatrical release ( but didn't love it) i still bought it when it came to DVD...and to be honest, when i watched it the 2nd time on DVD, i didn't think as much of it, as when i left the cinema.",2005
7,"First off, this was a more complete version of the DVD which came out earlier. In this edition, about a half-hour of new material was added to the disc (and what was shown at the theaters.) All reviews I read said it elevated this film from ""fair at best"" to ""good."" I agree. It made the movie much, much better.",2005
10,"As I titled this, I really enjoyed the movie since I am comic nerd, but I rated this as a 5 out of 10. I got the Directer's Cut for Christmas and OH MY GOD it made this movie so much better. The subplot with Coolio really rounds out the character's of Matt and Foggy and little scenes added back in here and there like Matt's rituals after patrol and in the morning, and the extended version of him and Elektra on the roof before the rain made part of the ending make more sense. One thing I really enjoyed was the additional time to developing the Kingpin and making him really seem like a bad guy helped a lot. All in all whoever made the call to cut all this stuff from the movie should be fired from the studio because the theatrical release was a butchery and a farce. I felt bad having to admit that I didn't like the movie too much at first, but now I can tell people how much it kicked a$$ (didn't know if curses were allowed).",2005
8,"I give DareDevil high grades, 8/10, strongly due to the excellent casting. Affleck is a terrific DareDevil who seems to exude confidence as a lawyer, but then exudes pain as a tortured soul. Look for his father, the boxer, who I remember from Officer and a Gentlemen. Jennifer Garner is another good casting as the sexy Elektra. But the stars really are Colin Farrell who plays the totally lunatic assassin BullsEye to the T. And Paul Michael Duncan steals the show as Kingpin.",2014
6,"This is one of my absolute favorite comic book movies ever made. It's dark, it's entertaining, it has great story. And I gotta tell that Ben Affleck is great too in the costume of Daredevil. He's great and that's that! I don't know why he was nominated Razzie Award, in my opinion he was awesome. The other actors in the movie are great too! There is Colin Farrell. Usually I not a fan of him, but here, he's gave us an awesome performance as the professional killer the Bullseye. He can kill you with nut. No joke. He's a great character. And there is Michael Clarke Duncan as the Kingpin. Well, I know that in the original comic book, the Kingpin is white, but you know what? Doesn't matter. This Kingpin is similar to the comic book-Kingpin, except the color of they're skin. Both of them are big, both of them are brutal and Duncan has a voice that makes my skin crawl.",2009
7,"I have recently seen the Daredevil Director's Cut, and was surprised - the movie is pretty entertaining and well played. It even has some memorable poetic scenes. I believe Ben Affleck lends more depth and plausibility to Daredevil than Christian Bale did to his monosyllabic Batman. Collin Farrell delivers an intriguing and funny superhero movie villain (a rare treat, that was later brought to perfection by his friend Heath). Michael Clarke Duncan and Jennifer Garner are, each in their own way, beautiful to behold, and perform well in their archetypal roles. Overall, if you enjoy superhero movies and skipped this one, see it - just make sure to get the Director's Cut.",2014
8,"Another great superhero movie with some very colourful characters. I love that the original creator made a very unique superhero who is blind and has his other senses heightened (which helps!) Ben Affleck was brilliant as The Daredevil, I think they chose the perfect person for that role.",2005
9,"Despite the low ratings this movie has gotten from the masses, I honestly can say that this is probably the best Marvel movie to come out in the recent barrage of comic based movies to hit the big screen. I'm guessing the reason for the lack of high ratings is that most people were looking for a super hero along the lines of Spiderman who saves people and is always doing ""the right thing"". Well this obviously isn't the case here, as one can clearly see from how Daredevil does away with the baddies. I personally think that the concept of an avenging lawyer who serves up street justice to those that manipulate the system is a great concept. I also think that everybody did a great job of playing their characters as they should be played, yes I know, even Ben. The only person I thought did a mediocre job was Colin, who only helped to make the already stupid looking Bullseye look even dumber then the character deserves. As you can no doubt guess from reading this, I'm a huge fan of the series. What you probably wouldn't guess is that choosing Michael Clarke Duncan to play the Kingpin is by far the best ""improvisational"" casting choice I've ever seen. For those of you who don't know, the Kingpin is ""supposed"" to be a big white guy we're talking sumo style big. While Michael isn't quite that big, his size and look are by far better then anybody else they could have ever gotten to play this role. So, in conclusion, if you like your hero's on the darker side, a la Batman, then this should be a good choice for you. The effects and story line are great; I can only hope that the only ""acceptable"" attendance at the theaters won't stop them from making a sequel to this movie I know, don't hate me but with Ben playing Daredevil again as well don't worry, I hate myself too!!! And P.S. Elektra isn't a sequel it's a separate plot line all together, although they try to link the two at some point in the movie, but that's another comment for another movie.",2005
10,"The story of the Daredevil, since when he was a boy, is the storyline of this movie. The plot presents how he became the lawyer Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck) during the day and the blind hero in the night. The movie shows his accident with toxic waste, the incident with his father, his crush with the gorgeous Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner) and this fight against crime, mainly against Bullseye (Colin Farrell) and Kingpin (Michael Clark Duncan). This excellent movie is completely underrated: the story of this Gothic and dark hero is very well presented, even for those viewers like me, who is not familiarized this character. The effects, showing how Daredevil 'sees' being blind are great. The heavy soundtrack is marvelous. The storyline and the characters are very well developed. I am a great fan of Ben Affleck, but I have never paid attention to this wonderful actress Jennifer Garner in other movies. Colin Farrell is great like the caricatural villain and Michael Clark Duncan is 'great', as usual. I have loved this movie, and recommend it for those who like action and fantasy movie. An excellent entertainment. My vote is ten.",2003

8,"This might date this review a bit, but let me begin by saying that I am watching this film well before ""Batman vs. Superman"" is being released, and I don't know what all of the Ben Affleck hate is about. I know there's a new ""Daredevil"" show out on Netflix as well and it's sure to gather a lot of people dismissing that ""old movie"" as trash, but hey, just wait a moment. I've just finished the director's cut (which ads a full 30 minutes to the running time), and it does have some flaws but otherwise this is a solid 2000's superhero movie. I like it a lot and putting it in the same category as ""Ghost Rider"" or ""Fantastic Four"" is a grave mistake. I can't remember what the theatrical cut was like, but this version runs about 2hrs and 15 minutes so there are some significant changes.",2015

But when I saw that there was a better version in the director's cut, I had to see for myself. Daredevil happens to be a dark, brooding film that came out at a time when superhero movies were all light and fluffy. I liked that because it led to the rise of the dark Christopher Nolan Batman films. This film has some cool villains, a blind superhero with good intentions, and even some wit.",2013
10,"I saw this film only recently on HBO and I must say I was impressed. I wish I had seen it on the big screen as the cinematography and stunts were wonderfully evocative and would have been more appreciated in a theatre. I was also impressed with the storyline, being that it was much darker than I anticipated. Much more interesting. I like the fact that Daredevil/Matt was at a crossroads in his life, that he didn't know anymore if he was ""the bad guy"" or not. It was all about the dreams of a super-hero lost.",2004
9,"This is without a doubt the best superhero movie out there. Forget Spider-man with its colorful character swinging through the streets of new york. Forget Batman with it's dark brooding character and over the top comic to film transition. In half of the batman movies I half expected Wham Kasplat or kazump to show up in the middle of a fight scene. But this isn't about Batman, or spider-man for that matter. This is about Dare devil. A super hero that most people have never even heard of. Which is one of the reason's why it didn't do as good at the box office as it should have done. Which in hindsight this is a shame as some people out there are missing a great film. Right from the start we are drawn into the story by meeting a beaten up Ben Afflick in the title role. We then hear him say the immortal line ""they say that when you are about to die you see your whole life flash before your eye's. That is also true of a blind man"" And then of course we are taken to back to when the hero of the film was a normal boy growing up in a part of new york called hells kitchen. An origin story that to my mind hasn't been implemented as well in any other movie. The film doesn't let up from that moment either, and if superhero's existed they would exist in the form of dare devil. The scene where Mat Murdock return's home after dispensing of a really nasty rapist is masterful. Beaten and bruised he steps in the shower, and as the water trickles over his battered body you can see the blood trickling down the drain, then cut to his face as he pinches a single tooth that comes away from his jaw then clunks to the bottom of the shower with a ching. Then after stepping out we see him go straight to the medicine cabinet and pop some painkillers into his mouth. Then after stepping into his sound proof coffin so that he will not go mad from the high intensity sounds he is constantly hearing, he passes into something slightly less pleasurable than sleep. You know at this point that this is a super hero. There is no Aunt May or butler Alfred at home to cook him a nice cup of tea. He is completely alone. Doing what he does not to get thanks. But because he has the ability to do it. I don't even class this movie as a movie. This move is pure Art. Made and written by people that love the whole daredevil mythos. The man without fear. And to all those people that hated the movie I am sorry. I am sorry that the film hasn't got the recognition that it deserve's and i am sorry that everyone who hated the film so much hasn't really watched the film. Just remember as daredevil said in his own words. ""I'm not the bad guy""",2005

The dialogue was weak and, in particular, the special effects were disappointing for this day and age. There was too much obvious work in front of the blue screen and the situations were so preposterous that I eventually gave up on the film after enduring too much of a particularly ridiculous chase.

5,"The verdict is in and hopeful critics and public alike seem to agree that director McG pushed the envelope so far it broke and turned  ""CA:FT"" into a colossal dud. Not an uncommon problem when one is trying to out do himself with a sequel, especially for a young auteur working in the action genre. McG appears to have fallen victim to that more-is-more mentality as he takes the ""Angels"" into the realm of action movie super heroes of comic book proportion. The loss is credibility, personality, and humanness...qualities which keep us riveted to the screen through all the action and fluff for there is no suspense or thrill if good is unequivocally invincible and the doom of evil a foregone conclusion. Perhaps the most sadly laughable moment in this film is when Demi Moore's trains her Desert Eagle on the speaker box with a tear running down one cheek. At that moment it is blindingly obvious that someone should have been working smarter, not harder.

(Nothing wrong with having an African American ""Bosley,"" but give him some decent material.) The action scenes were so preposterous that they made me roll my eyes.

The film is similar to the ""Toy Story"" pacing, in that we follow two different protagonists in their attempt to return to one another.  In brief summary, Marlin the overprotective father clownfish must overcome his own fear of open ocean to try and find his only son, Nemo, who has been captured by a diver and transplanted to an ocean-view dentist's office fish tank.",2003

It's the best movie I've EVER seen, and I know I say that about alot movie, but I actually mean it this time. Never, did I ever come out of a theater after seeing a movie smile for the rest of the night. The movie just completely blew me away. I knew it was going to be good, but I had no clue what was in store for me when I saw it opening night. This movie is a work of pure genius. The animation is just beautiful, acting is awesome, the music fit everything that was going on. I could go on and on with this list, but I think I'll stop there. What I liked mostly about this movie was that it didn't lack anything at all. There was just the right amount of comedy, drama, suspense/action, and even romance. And it all blended together beautifully. This is why I gave this movie a full 10. Believe, me if I could give it more, I would.",2004

I don't think so. has any animated film ever had such detail? probably not. but it simply isn't worth sitting through the hour and half view time of this depressingly slow movie just for the visual dynamics. I have the sneaking suspicion that the animators at pixar had the visual concept LONG before a storyline and had to make one up on the fly. the beginning is so sad and miserable that the ending feels utterly anti-climatic. never have I seen such a gorgeously animated children's film that left me feeling so hopeless and sad. in short if you want realism and breathtaking detail. watch some nature shows on discovery channel in HD. and if,like me. you want to be entertained stick with Monster's Inc or Ice Age",2013
6,"I remember the first time I saw this Pixar movie when it first came out when I was in elementary school. I thought it was alright back then but nothing special. And didn't have the impact on me during my childhood like the movie ""Lion King"" or the first ""Toy Story"" did. Didn't think it was a bad film back then but wasn't enthusiastic about it to the point I wanted to see it a second time. Now seeing it again as an adult in 3D my opinions about this movie is still about the same but I appreciate it a bit more. So the story is about a Clown fish that loses his only son and he goes across the ocean with a friend fish named Dory played by Ellen DeGeneres. Who did a amazing job with her role, in fact her character stood out the most in the whole movie. And through the journey it shows what Nemo is going through after being captured by the humans but mostly shows Nemo's dad's journey with clever fish scenarios thrown in different areas. And the clever scenarios mixed in with different fishes is what drives this movie. Overall it was a alright movie and you can tell quite a bit of effort has been thrown into this animated flick. But it didn't really have that impact to make it all that memorable.",2012

7,"""Finding Nemo"" is obviously a good movie. But, like many Pixar films, it's overrated. It seems they give more attention to CGI movies than older animated classics like ""The Lion King"" and ""Beauty And The Beast"", that deserve to be in the Top 250 instead of this kind of film. There are good Pixar films, like ""Cars"" and ""The Incredibles"", but I don't think that it deserves to rank the 2nd best Disney film ever behind only The Incredibles. Now, they also leave out ""Pinocchio"", ""Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs"", ""Dumbo"", ""Bambi"", and other classics created during Disney's life. This is a very good movie, but I think it deserves the highest rating of a 7.3 or 7.4.",2006
7,"This film is supposed to be ""the best Pixar film"". I disagree. The film is incredibly overrated. Sharks that are trying to not eat fish, what the hell are they supposed to eat? Just wondering. Although Ellen DeGenerous is awesome as Dory. Dory was one of the 2 things that saved this film. The second was the animation. The beginning is beautiful and truly has the pixar animation. Although I feel this film could have been PG. The mom is killed and some of the scenes can be scary.",2006

Superficially, he is an unstoppable raging behemoth whose strength is rarely matched. This alone would be an obvious foundation for a film franchise. What is surprising (and ultimately refreshing) about this one is its willingness to explore the depth of the Hulk's dilemma. If the film's jade giant were absent from this movie, its story could still be the frame for another.",2003
7,"If you saw this when it first came out, you would probably have hated the split screen cut away's etc The story seemed complicated at the time and it was the first re-enactment since the TV series so a lot of the audience had a sentimental attachment to Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno. I've watched this on TV over the years and for some reason I am strongly drawn to it. I just think its underrated. Watching it now 21st May 2016 I think it does fit in with the Marvel Universe and offers a good backstory especially of his love for Betty Ross. The affects are not totally bad as when you watch you become more enthralled with the story. I am still not a fan of the split screen/24 dual story imaging but otherwise I think it is an underrated film. I'm neither DC or Marvel i'm more the action hero and for me it was always Superman and Spiderman /Incredible Hulk as the also rans. Superman was just the hero. As a kid growing up nothing more i'd love to do sometimes would be wear a shirt id grown out of and try and do muscular stretches at 10 and burst that old school shirt. This film has grown on me now i'm 43 and while I did n't like it at the time its grown on me the more I've seen it over the years on TV. Superman Returns V Hulk then this wins as Superman Returns was such a missed opportunity. Casting is great Bana,Elliot,Connelly and even Nolte buying into comic book Folk Lore for the time. When I first watched Hulk id have given it a 5.5 i'd now have to say its worth a 7. The special effects are not bad still - ie they draw you in and you don';t question the rendering like some tech head. The story seems easier to understand and HULK as a character fits in with the current Avengers Marvel Universe. Overall it's a film thats aged well and should be up-rated rather than under rated.",2016
10,"I know the current ""Avengers"" movies are popular right now, and everybody digs Mark Ruffalo's version of the Hulk (myself included), I still consider Ang Lee's 2003 ""Hulk"" to be one of the finest comic book based movies ever, and contrary to popular belief, one of the most faithful. Being a true fan of the Hulk comic stories from the 60's to the 80's, I think I can say this with credibility. I'm also coming from the angle that the 70's TV show is not the real Hulk. ",2012
6,"Hulk is poorly directed. I know it. You know it. Ang Lee knows it. However, while the direction nearly destroys the film, the performances of Eric Bana, Jennifer Connelly, and Nick Nolte are the saviors of the film. Bana is great as the ferocious green brute, catching every emotion that is required playing the most complex character in the Marvel universe...well The Punisher's up there too, but whatever. Connelly as Betty Ross is a good move, and the Oscar winner does not mess up. She is extremely likable as the love interest of Bruce Banner, more likable then Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane Watson, Katie Holmes' Rachel Dawes, or Kate Bosworth's Lois Lane. Nick Nolte as the father to Bruce (simply credited as the greatest credit ever: father) is bone chilling and creepy. He plays a wonderful David Banner in this film, and he becomes a classic villain in the film (no spoilers here). What really drags this film down is the cheesy music, crappy direction, and crappier writing. Be forewarned that the Hulk will not appear until about 45 minutes into the film, and before he appears, you'll feel extremely bored. In Spider-Man, you only had to wait about 7 minutes for Peter to get his powers, then about another 20 until he became Spider-Man. Daredevil is already born in the beginning of the film, and the Fantastic Four are created within minutes of the film's commencement. Hulk is a waste of time for the average moviegoer unless one is a comic lover or an action lover, because the action is pretty good. I liked the scenes where Hulk races away from the military, especially the ones in the desert. Bana and Connelly have great chemistry in the film, but sadly the terrible writing and direction, not to mention poor decision making overshadow this and a chilling performance from Nick Nolte.",2006

What I had been expecting and hoping was just endless scenes of the hulk smashing sh#t up. What I got was an art film. At the time I didn't understand or care about any of the split screens, dream sequences, etc, I was just waiting for the hulk to show up and destroy stuff.(The hulk dosen't show up till about 40 minutes into the movie, by the way.) I eventually began to get restless because it is a very slow movie and when it was over I felt very disappointed.",2012
6,"Ang Lee attempted a different approach in his direction in Hulk. The recipe for superhero comic book movie was not followed and for that, it failed in entertaining the mainstream audience. It is more off-beat, more difficult. The music score by Danny Elfman is much heavier than on the average Spider-Man film. The character is not a hero--nor is he a villain. It is a dark story of a pretty dark character. I believe that this is its essentially biggest problem: it is humourless to the core and when featuring a dark character like the Hulk, you need some serious light-hearted comic relief to counter it.",2006

But that's just it, Hulk is not a super-hero, his story has less to do with epic battles than it does with an idea. The Hulk is an allegory for uncontrolled rage.",2006

10,"Hulk (2003): Dir: Ang Lee / Cast: Eric Bana, Jennifer Connelly, Nick Nolte, Sam Elliott, Josh Lucas: A tremendous vision of the popular comic book hero. It regards massive problems that affect us mentally. For Bruce Banner that would be a childhood trauma that resulted in the imprisonment of his father. He realizes that a force surfaces inside him when his anger peaks. Detailed setup introduces Banner and co-worker Betty Ross, played by Jennifer Connelly testing research while an ominous figure poised as a janitor observes. Spectacular work by Ang Lee who previously made the excellent Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. Eric Bana is engaging as Banner whose past is a blur but he fights to use his condition towards good. When he transforms into the raging green Hulk he is misunderstood by all except Ross. Connelly provides understanding and sympathy as she is targeted for danger yet protected by Hulk. She knows in the end what viewers are given a glimpse of when all seems gone. Sam Elliott plays her military father who previously shut down the lab. Now he faces new dilemmas that involve his daughter. Nick Nolte brings forth a father functioning by mistakes. Josh Lucas plays a sinister former soldier attempting to force Banner and Ross to work for him. The Hulk's battles against tanks are impressive mirroring our expectations.

Meaning no disrespect to Eric Bana, but Edward Norton is more believable as the cerebral Banner, and Liv Tyler with her glasses on is sufficiently bookish for Betty Ross. A great cameo by Tim Blake Nelson (with a hint of Simpsons' nutty professor) is just manic enough without being overly comedic. Unfortunately for a Marvel flick I feel that it was let down by the action sequences, but I suppose it could have been worse, I could have been viewing in 3D, good enough in the end, but roll on The Avengers.",2013

When a suspect asks for lawyer, the usual answer from any of the detectives is: ""why? you have something to hide?"" and the suspect does not insist. So do not wait to see any lawyer in the series-you will not find one. Furthermore, the detectives violate any right, beating suspects, creating false evidence, doing whatever they want without any fear. Its simply a fascist series.

Eventually, the detectives have gone through everyone the victim has ever known, and now they discover that one or more is lying. So they question the supposed the liar, who in turn puts the blame on someone else, and so on and so forth.

Every Vietnam veteran character they've ever had has turned out to be the killer, unless it was another Vietnam veteran. There has only been one black murderer, and he was put up to it by his white boss. The only Hispanic killer was a ""race traitor"" who killed another Hispanic to frame a Hispanic street kid for a crime that (naturally) two rich white kids committed. What a bunch of propaganda.

Can't believe all the praise lauded onto this film. The story could have been so much more meaningful had Penn finally done something to help his friend Robbins after abandoning him in childhood.

Yesterday, I saw it on DVD and I was impressed with the direction of Clint Eastwood and the performance of the cast. It is almost impossible to highlight one actor or actress, but I was stunned with the performance of Sean Penn. It is a film based on the acting, and not on special effects, shootings or race of cars. I was very impressed, since the tragic story of the loss of the youth is very real, full of human flaws, disturbances, prejudice and judgements.

4,"The last time I saw Sean Penn's work, he was taking himself far too seriously in the tragically flawed 21 Grams--a depressing and simple story jazzed up by cutting into pieces and presenting them out of order. Mystic River is a depressing and simple story jazzed up by over-acting and music (written by Clint Eastwood) that sounds like a grade-school etude exercise. Why is it that contemporary auteurs believe that lack of a sensible plot, comic relief, and meaningful themes can be overcome through extreme close-ups of actors mimicking emotional turmoil, lingering for eternities as Penn's eyebrow twitches or Robbins pouts. Essentially, Penn thinks his old pal Robbins whacked his daughter, so he whacks Robbins. Oops, made a mistake. That's the story. The backstory involves childhood sexual abuse, and has nothing to do with the plot. It's tacked on to the side with a few pins related to where Robbins really was (whacking a child molester) and why he was such a loser (haunted, of course). Unfortunately, the film does not address in any meaningful fashion the issue of child molestation. It also does not handle the murder mystery very well, since the actual killers of Penn's daughter turn out to be related to Penn in a way that would make a hack writer blush with shame. Mystic River is also riddled with gangster flick clichés most writers discarded decades ago -- the Savage (!) brothers who do all the dirty work, the crusty wife who encourages Penn's criminality like Lady Macbeth, the cop from the old neighborhood (Kevin Bacon) with mixed feelings about the gangsters he investigates, and the (old man) river (running through it) that serves as ""silent witness,"" and so on. This is an altogether mindless, humorless and simple flick all done up with production values and more meaningful looks than a Mexican soap opera.",2004
5,"Glad to see there are other disappointed viewers of Mystic River. This is the movie that could have been good based on the story. But the actual script, directing and yes, acting , are off just enough so that the parts to do not add up to an exceptional whole. Sean Penn was really ""ACTING"" as hard as he could, Marcia Gay Harden seemed overly fidgety and pathetic. SPOILERS: The biggest weaknesses of this movie are the story elements- why did Sean Penn's relationship with his daughter seem incestuous and yet that was never examined, why is Tim Robbins in a gay cruising area when he attacks and kills a man, what does Kevin Bacon's estranged wife have to do with any of this (except to confirm that it's a ""happy"" ending for him), why does Laura Linney suddenly turn into Lady Macbeth at the end- excuse me, was Lady Macbeth even in this film before the end? And the main thread of the movie- who killed Sean Penn's daughter- oops, it was just a couple of foolish kids and they don't know why they did it. Oops, sorry. The potential for tragedy is so untapped here- the little kid that actually committed the murder should have done it for revenge- Sean Penn killed his father years before! Hello, why is there no connection here other than a weak coincidence that up til then had been the PLOT! Clint Eastwood dropped the ball big time.",2004

4,"Your bitter reviewer walked into the theater with high expectations, I had to beg my fiancee to see this, promising her the masterpiece that the hype said it was. It was, to put it gently, not as good as an average episode of ""Law and Order"". The characters that weren't overdone or hopeless cliches (e.g. Celeste) were given no consistent motivations or satisfactory explanations for their actions (Jimmy, Sean). The movie waffles on the strength and extent of the boys friendship; Are they still friends? If so, do  Dave and Sean know that Jimmy is a small time mafioso? Is all of Boston related to each other,  at least six of the major and minor characters are cousins, including Jimmy and Dave (by marriage I assume) yet supposedly they barely know each other anymore. Celeste was a horrible character, first the whole film she looked like she'd scream and cry if her kid or anyone else sneezed. Then she sells out her husband to Jimmy, someone who will most likely at least beat him within an inch of his life if not kill him and then sells JIMMY out to Sean after the situation she brought about has climaxed. This is not a woman you want to go hunting with. And the murderers, where do I begin? Sean said they HAD NO MOTIVE. This is bad writing. They just wanted to play tough guys and the random passerby, the victim, just HAPPENS to be his brother's girlfriend and not only that, the daughter of the hood that his father ratted out when he was most likely two and sent up for a stretch. The kid had no way of knowing, and I give the movie credit for not suggesting it, that Jimmy murdered his father. To top it all off, if this was a random act and an accident that she died, why did they abuse the body? Like I said, bad writing. Kevin Bacon's last five minutes in the movie is on repeat somewhere in actors and filmmakers Hell. He goes from hearing about his friend's death, someone he obviously feels indebted to, to laughing and smiling on the phone to his creepy, stalking wife. He follows this gem with the ""finger gun"" during the parade with a bizarre smirk on his face. Methinks making movies like ""Wild Things"" has damaged the acting center of his brain. This movie is nothing what critics or the hype said it would be, there are better films by all these actors and this director, both in front of and behind the camera. Go rent those. Movies like this make orphans cry.",2003

1,"The nauseating accolades that this monstrous movie has received just prove that Hollywood does its job very well. Throw in some brilliant actors, clever cinematography, a melodramatic score and an iconic director, and voilà - suspension of disbelief - of good sense - of morality itself. Perhaps it is the result of playing in too many Westerns in which there is no rule of law. Mr. Eastwood, for whom I had the greatest respect UNTIL I saw this film, seems to advocate a return to those times when we settled our differences with our guns and with impunity.",2005
9,"This movie is a kick in the gut. Rarely is such a brilliant cast assembled, and even when it happens, rarely do they act like this. Tom Guiry (very impressive), Tim Robbins and Sean Penn show emotion that directors don't often stick in. And it comes off flawlessly. During a scene with Marcia Gay-Harden and Tim Robbins crying in their kitchen, there is an energy coming off of the screen that strikes you right in the chest. Which is really the way the whole movie works. It grabs you and shakes you, and makes you watch even when it can be painful to do so. The only reason that this film didn't win best picture is Return of the King. Any other year, and Mystic River has it. Eastwood's finest moment. Check it out--you won't be disappointed.",2005

Holes is a story about Stanley Yelnats IV.  He is unlucky in life.  Unlucky in fact characterizes the fates of most of the Yelnats men and has been since exploits of Stanley IV's `no good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather.'  Those particular exploits cursed the family's men to many an ill-fated turn.  It is during just such a turn that we meet Stanley IV.  He has been accused, falsely, of stealing a pair of baseball shoes, freshly donated to a homeless shelter auction, by a famous baseball player.  He is given the option of jail, or he can go to a character building camp.  `I've never been to camp before,' says Stanley.  With that the Judge enthusiastically sends him off to Camp Green Lake.",2003
9,"I couldn't keep from commenting after reading the very short ""Not bad"" commentary. This movie is much better than just not bad. The acting is stellar, even from the children in the cast, who don't play cute or anything else but act just like my son's friends. The movie is smart and expects it's audience to be as well. The double back flash story lines are imaginative and contribute to the story rather than act as time filler. I watched this movie with my kids and then I watched it again by myself a few days later. If you have kids and are sick to death of movies that inspire a diabetic coma with their syrupy sweetness, then check out ""Holes."" My 6-year-old enjoyed it as much as my 11-year-old, and my husband and I enjoyed it as much as the two of them. How many movies can you say that about?",2006
9,"HOLES is not your average Disney stuff- it's very, very fun, even for adults who usually cringe at the cutesy, focus-group designed ""family entertainment"" that Uncle Walt's studio passes off as live-action. Perhaps the secret of this film's success is in its faithfulness to the original book, which is a little bit darker than your average kid stuff. The action begins when Stanley Yelnats is sent to a boys' prison camp, where all the inmates are forced to dig holes under the desert sun as a form of rehibilitation. But as the story progresses, Stanley's tale becomes interwoven with that of a legendary treasure, and this adventure becomes ten times more fun than any Disney movie about an all-boy prison camp has any right to be. Jon Voight is especially nasty and colorful, and Sigourney Weaver is beautiful, as always.",2005
8,"Typically, ""kids"" films have some annoying quality to it that makes it way too sappy and unbearable for someone over 13. But then again, that's before Holes hit the scene. Sure, it has the very same moments that often times give a kids movie its aforementioned quality, but this film does a good job of staying away from such conventions. The acting was decent, and the uneasy dynamics that Stanley had with some of the other campers was more realistic than what most movies seek to portray. What I especially liked about this movie was the fact that this film didn't try to break your heart or make you cry. The emotional power was a little more natural than most would imagine, kind of like The Shawshank Redemption in many ways (which Holes also has a similar, redemptive ending to it). The only down side? The hokey looking lizards. Overall, however, an 8/10.",2003
10,"And I'm serious! Truly one of the most fantastic films I have ever had the pleasure of watching. What's so wonderful is that very rarely does a good book turn into a movie that is not only good, but if possible better than the novel it was based on. Perhaps in the case of Lord of the Rings and Trainspotting, but it is a rare occurrence indeed. But I think that the fact that Louis Sachar was involved from the beginning helped masses, so that the film sticks close to the story but takes it even further. This film has many elements that make it what it is:",2005
9,"Holes, the novel, was forced on me in an education course. I didn't think I would like a children's novel; plus, the other couple of books I was forced to read for the class were really bad. But, to my surprise, I absolutely loved Holes. It really is one of the most perfectly written novels I've ever read. I think it has the rare quality that makes it appeal to pre-teens, teenagers, and adults. Everyone who reads it, I think, will walk away a better person. While I can't quite say that for the film, I am happy to say that they got it mostly right. I don't think viewers of the film will walk away as enriched, but they will certainly be entertained, without the side effect of being stupider when they sat down. It is an intelligent story, and it's very well told. I think it moves a tad too quickly. The novel takes more time in developing the characters. And the flashbacks come in and out so quickly that they don't have too much time to register. The interracial romance in the past feels more cliché and trite than it does in the novel. And the ending, which ties together all the loose threads, seems very ridiculous. It's exactly the same in the novel, but there's a sense of the absurd that doesn't quite exist in the film. It works a lot better. I also don't like the multitude of pop songs. I wish Disney didn't feel it such a necessity to sell soundtracks. The cast is across-the-board excellent, from the young kids to the old pros. Jon Voight is especially great. Not quite sure why we need Catwoman and the Fonze, though. 9/10.",2003
10,"This is one of my favorite films of all time. I read the book and liked it, but this movie expands on everything the book made famous. The acting is fantastic, especially from Jon Voight, who plays Mr. Sir, a very evil character. This film has a certain way of storytelling that keeps you hooked throughout, until the end where everything is pulled together for a great ending. I also love the way this is directed, by flashing back and forth between the modern day and Stanley's ancestors' stories. The story was written by Louis Sachar, yes, but it seems that this story is made for film, and Andrew Davis does a great job directing it. I definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys good movies.",2008
10,"In the area of movies based off of screenplays from some other area (or whatever the title for that Oscar is), ""Holes"" has credibility.

Aside from that, this review is about ""Holes"".",2003

8,"A Disney movie that dares to do something different should at least be awarded for effort. ""Holes"" doesn't make the same mistakes as one would expect from a Disney movie about troubled teenagers put in a camp. For the first time events are not explained in details. The flashback scenes really do serve a purpose and present several mature topics that may surprise the viewer. I must admit that at first I was a bit put off by the seriousness of the movie. But soon I realized that we had to endure those moments to see the beauty of the story. Besides the story this movie also does a good job of questioning some methods that are used in correctional facilities. (One example where Caveman is forbidden to teach Zero to read because they have to dig holes in order to build character,like learning to read won't contribute to that). ""Holes"" is a movie that is smart and beautiful. A must watch!",2009
6,"Holes is a wolf in sheep's clothing. It appears to be a simple Disney kids film, but turns into so much more. Of course, that's where it's dragged down: when it tries to be a Disney film. At times it has quality of older films that are PG because there's not much offensive material in it, but at times it seems like a film fit for a Disney audience. When I went into Holes, I expected the script to be mutilated from the book, even though it's written by the author Louis Sachar. However, it's similar to the book, except with both a few welcome differences and a few unwelcome ones.",2003
7,"This film is an entertaining, fun and quality film. The film very cleverly follows the guidelines if the book, and tries to stick to the exact lines. The actors are all suitable, and you would expect them to be the part. They use some famous actors which give a great effect on the film. The graphics is a bit dodgy in some parts, and there are quite a few mistakes throughout the film. There is no such thing as a Yellow Spotted Lizard, for example. The camp is not as gruesome as explained in the book, and they tend not to show the goings on in the camp as much as the book. All of his group are mentioned a lot in the book, but are not in the film. Overall, a great film for a rainy afternoon",2007
7,A very unexpected Disney gem about friendship. This is basically about a group of kids digging holes. Sounds boring right? well luckily we get a western side story to keep the movie rolling.

Never mentioned any other children or wife prior to his speaking with and falling in love with the teacher? Maybe she had a child prior to becoming the kissing Kate Bandit? Even with the mistakes in the movie. Just loved it. The acting was great. Not sure where the story was with Mr. Sir being Marion a women at the end but makes his character even funnier. The other ""counseler"" did seem concerned for the kids but of course maybe not so much. Poor Warden must have had a really stinky childhood to be so mean when she grew up.",2008

Through flashbacks, we learn that a number of things are closer than we realize (you'll understand this better when you see the movie).

I noticed that one loser, jpd 9 admits that he had a premature ejaculation at 20 minutes into the movie (of the cassette, that is) but that's okay, because he magically surmised the entirety of the film in those first 20 minutes. LONG before the warden made her appearance, LONG before Jon Voights absolutely hilarious almost over-the-top performance and especially his great ""story"" that he tells the boys about the magical kingdom where it never rained. He goes on to say that he can't tell us much about the movie cause he didn't watch it. Well. Thanks for the heads up on that one, chatty cathy. Maybe next time you could just keep your stupid mouth shut. And FYI, those ""aging stars""? What, you think they're STUPID?

9,"The characters of ""The Dreamers"" love movies. They pass their time quoting them, reenacting scenes from them, and debating age-old questions such as the merits of Chaplin versus Keaton. When at the cinema, they make sure to sit in the rows closest to the screen. Why? So the images will reach them before anyone else, while still fresh. If this strikes you as illogical, perhaps ""The Dreamers"" isn't the movie for you. This is a film about film lovers and will likely be most appreciated by lovers of film in return. The basic narrative follows Matthew, a young American (the boyish Michael Pitt), who is studying in Paris during the late 60s, the time of the student riots. The film does a good job of setting up the loneliness which engulfs him in this foreign place, so we are quick to understand why he so eagerly accepts the offer to stay with French twins Isabelle and Theo (Eva Green and Louis Garrel) he has met at- where else?- the cinema.

Two are brother (Garrel) and sister (Green) identical twins (or so we're told) who have an almost metaphysical bond and the third is an interloper (Pitt) who falls in lust with the sister. There's little plot to this slice of young adult life flick which seems to be more of a Bertolucci pet project than a commercial product for the masses. Less than engaging and much less than compelling, ""The Dreamers"" immerses itself in the esoterics of the place and time to the exclusion of anyone who wasn't there then. Beautifully filmed and masterfully crafted with some young actors doing superb work under difficult circumstances with plenty of graphic nudity and sex, ""The Dreamers"" will play best with aficionados of French cinema, Bertolucci fans, etc. Those who are squeamish about sex/nudity should pass.

One thing I need to complain about the movie, is the hypocrisy that I read in the trivia section, saying that if they show Matthew's and Theo's relationship it might have been ""too much'' for the public, but Theo and Isabelle, that are brother and sister, can sleep together and have the most unusual behavior of all.

The main characters are a young American student who has come to France to study film... and a very unconventional brother and sister who recruit him to their offbeat lifestyle. All three are obsessed by film (as many young people were in 1968... the glory days of the avant garde)... and also with the concept of breaking rules and societal taboos. With their parents away for the month and the flat to themselves, bets are made on film trivia and the penalties for not identifying a particular moment from a particular film become more and more shocking. Only leaving their home to watch films, the trio are basically oblivious to the growing trouble in the streets... until finally they can sit passively no more. Very intriguing concept and the acting is fine... but ultimately I thought the conclusion fell a little flat... the transition from sexual hedonism to political activism didn't really work for me... it all seemed a little abrupt and could have been explored a little deeper.

This film is as far away from Maborosi as you can get yet both films are up there as great pieces of cinema. I wont divulge the plot or end this comment with a Latin quote to reinforce my self importance i'll just say go and watch it, preferably if you're not too squeamish and don't mind subtitles.This film left me thinking about it the following day which is normally a good thing (atleast it shows my memory is working!)",2007
9,"Oldboy takes a hammer and ""batters"" its American equivalents, leaving them as pulped as a chewed up squid. Park Chan Wook displays what America misses with his ultra-stylish, ultra-violent thriller. Why watch Ben Affleck fail spectacularly to summon any displayable talent, when Min sik Choi serves up a memorable role as the disturbed, vengeful Dae Su Oh, in the second of the Vengeance trilogy. Park skillfully creates a compelling plot that will have you guessing through the entire film, up until the final shocking revelation. The Cinematography expertly done by Jeong-hun Jeong, who also worked on the follow up to this film, Chinjeolhan geumjassi. Everything about this film is done in style and panache and creates a memorable experience, and has many memorable scenes.",2007
10,"Yes this is a twisted movie with plots that unravel slowly and sometimes there are scenes that are slow. But over all it's incredible. Some of the symbolism behind the scenes are stunning. You have to go deep to appreciate it. There is a lot of gore and violence that can turn you off, but I was simply amazed by the depth and width of some of the scenes.",2007
1,"This movie is horrible. You don't find out the plot line in the exact order I'm laying it out, but in the end this is all that has happened:",2010
1,Why? That is the main question about this movie. When I watched this movie it didn't yet have its devoted followers. I just wanted to enjoy an Asian movie a friend had recommended. And as I like many Asian movies I had fairly high hopes. As you can tell by my rating of it they were disappointed.,2010
10,"While Hollywood is slowly choking to death on clichés and unrealistic budgets, the movie lovers turn their attention to Asia. Especially interesting is Korea's emerging movie industry. Japan has a long tradition of quality horror and anime and China dominates the epics with state-sponsored spectacles. Which place Korea will take we don't know but if Oldboy is any inclination it would be intelligent, disturbing drama-action movies.",2007
1,"Please do not blame Korea for this bad movie. I am in Korea (please excuse bad English). It sadden me to see these movies which make Korea look like obsessed with blood and sex. It sadden me even more to see animal killings and hear Americans say that is how Korea is. We do not eat live animals!! So please stop excusing movie for its crime by saying it is the culture! There is scenes with the man eating live animals and non Koreans think it is normal. No it is disgusting to us too. The director is a misfit, sick individual who has obsession with killing and sex with family members. I wish America and France will stop glorifying this bad man who is laughable in his own country. Please watch ANY OTHER movie from Korea, that will give you ideas of how artistic we really are. This movie is rubbish.",2007

1,"This movie was awful, plain and simple. It will probably be revered by those who only see ""films"" and not ""movies"" and will therefore feel sorry for me for having such a limited understanding of the theatrical brilliance of this film, but I am secure enough in my intellect to say that this boring, self-aggrandizing and painfully drawn-out movie was a waste of two hours and nine dollars.",2005
10,"Oldboy is one of the most intense movies you will ever see. Breathtaking, brutal and easily one of the best revenge movies ever made. The acting is amazing, especially Choi as the main protagonist Dae-su Oh. All the actors did great but his performance was powerful and emotional (all you need to do is see the infamous squid scene). Chan-wook Park gives this movie a very unique style with his direction. The plot starts off like a fairly standard revenge drama but he slowly makes the movie darker through a series of beautifully shot flashbacks and a huge scene involving nothing but a family photo album.",2007
10,"In an age of American cinema where our biggest blockbusters are based on films already successful overseas, this is one movie that needs to be seen by more American movie goers. This is the movie that got me hooked on Asian revenge films. Oldboy is an original movie that shows what happens when a man's freedom is taken away and he doesn't know why, or by whom. He is sudden thrust back into society where he must track down the person that took away his freedom. Along the way come multiple plot twist and surprises that you just don't see coming. ",2007
5,"Old Boy sucks! No, wait, let me rephrase that: Old Boy is a stylistically challenging, highly innovative, but ultimately hollow and repugnant exercise in genre film-making. ",2004
1,"I have been reading comments on IMDb for some time now. An 8.3 average for this movie just plain gets on my nerves. I don't mean to pull one of those ""I just signed up for an account so I can post on this movie"" bits..... but, i just did. The only theme you will come away with from this movie is that incest does not deserve to be ridiculed.",2009
1,This comment is meant mainly as a warning to the people who might be attracted to the title by its (temporarily)high user rating which I find frankly puzzling. The reasons why I didn't like this title are following:,2005
1,"It seems that some viewers assume that the only thing which can make the viewer dislike this movie is the graphic violence. In fact violence, both disturbing and cartoonish, is the last of ""Oldboy""'s deep flaws. The characters are unidimensional, underdeveloped, primitive. The ""intensity"", an obsession and a goal in itself with this director, is served up with the cheapest of means. Let's not confuse a mindless shot of adrenaline with artistic worth. By the end of the movie, it seems that all the cards were exhausted so the script becomes almost inadvertently funny in its efforts to find new levels of ""horror"", to continue to ""shock"" an audience which is already numbed by the plethora of dumb soap-opera ""revelations"" already served up in big bunches. It would be hard to imagine anybody even vaguely familiar with the masterpieces of the last fifty years of Asian cinema being enthralled by this pompous piece of trash. Imagine Homer Simpson hesitating in front of the cinema theater: ""should I go in or should I buy five cones of ice-cream for the same money?"" Be smart, Homer, go for the ice-cream.",2005
1,"I am sorry to rain on everybody's parade. Just a little background about me: I like and know a lot about Asian cinema, especially Japanese, Chinese and Indian. Admittedly I am a novice when it comes to South-Korean cinema but, if this is the best of the best, sorry. I just want you to know that I am not at all narrow-minded when it comes to appreciating foreign movies and I do not fit the stereotype of the ""dumb American"" . . . well, not perfectly.",2005
10,"Old Boy is my favourite film. As far as I can see, no amount of superlatives could explain quite how much I love it. After my first viewing, (all on my lonesome) I realised I probably hadn't blinked during its entirety and I could quite possibly have been burgled during its course and been none the wiser, such was the extent to which I found it totally and utterly engrossing. Obviously a review consisting of very little other than me spewing praise would be a fairly dull read which was why I never bothered to review Old Boy until after my second viewing, with my Po'. My father being the eternal sceptic that he is turned out to be an extremely worthy person to watch the film with, and his response to it opened my eyes a little as to why I love it that much.",2009
7,"A quick glance at the story or trailer tells you that School of Rock is probably the cheesiest, gratuitous, airhead excuse for a movie in ages, but if you thought that was a good reason to avoid it you'd be wrong. Jack Black plays the slightly past it rocker, stuck in a groove of 70s heavy metal rock and roll and refusing to move on  until his (more up to date) band fire him. Struggling to pay the rent, he takes a phone call intended for his schoolteacher flatmate and accepts a job as supply teacher at a top school. Soon he has the kids not only studying the history of rock and roll, soundproofing the room and playing rock instruments, but actually competing in a major Battle of the Bands' competition.",2004
8,"Greetings again from the darkness.  With so few good comedies these days, it was pure joy to laugh out loud a few times during this Jack Black showcase. Is he over the top? Absolutely.  Is his humor and delivery similar to the great John Belushi?  Yes, down to the arching eyebrows.  And I say SO WHAT? Jack Black is hilarious in this movie and director Richard Linklater (the underappreciated gem ""Dazed and Confused"") uses his spot-on observations of Rock music and school days to deliver a wonderful film going experience. Writer Mike White (""The Good Girl"") also plays Black's wimpy friend and former bandmate.  Although his acting is fine, it is White's writing that will make him rich in Hollywood.  The kids in the band are wonderfully cast and appear to be very talented musically as well.  Special recognition to Joan Cusack, who just nails the role of the uptight private school principal who is just itching to be unleashed.  I would have enjoyed a bit more of the Rock History tossed in for the sake of today's youngsters, but the tributes to Pete Townsend, Jimi Hendrix, Zeppelin and the Ramones are much appreciated.  Look for Nikki Katt in a brief role, but mostly just sit back and enjoy a pure comedy that truly ROCKS!!",2003
10,Finally! Somebody has done right by Jack Black. Somebody has actually made a movie where Jack Black can be the man and show off his talents. This is Jack Black at his best and I feel privileged to be alive while this guy's star continues to skyrocket! ,2004

One day as he shows up late for band practice he notices a new guitar player who is replacing him. Poor Dewey feels so bad about it and also about Ned and his girlfriend threatening to kick him out since he doesn't pay any of the bills. After a few days of trying to sell his guitars, which doesn't go very well, the head of a school calls and asks for Ned Schneebly, who is a talented substitute teacher with a good reputation. In a desperate attempt to getting money fast, Dewey impersonates Ned and conveniently finds himself the teacher of a third grade ( or something like that ) class for several weeks ahead. Yet another one of his crazy ideas strikes him and his plan to turn his class into a rockband to win the Battle of the Bands competition is set in motion. ",2004

When his friend and school teacher Ned Schneebly (Mike White) is called to a temporary work in an expensive private school, Dewey pretends to be Ned and accepts the job. He finds talented young musicians in his class, and he decides to form a rock-and-roll band with the students and win a competition called ""Battle of Bands"" to raise the prize and be recognized in the show business.",2005
10,"Has anyone noticed that School Of Rock is like a modern, rock version, and 10-millions times better version of Sound Of Music? Both are about a teacher who spends time with a small group of kids and inspires true music in them. Anyone who is 50-90 years old loves the Sound of Music, as a member of the younger generation today I think it's safe to say The School of Rock is the ""Sound of Music"" version of the new millennia, because I doubt another movie in the next 100 or maybe even 1000 years with the same plot (teacher inspiring kids with music) will do better than School Of Rock, just like no movie between 1900-2000 did better than the Sound Of Music in this regard.",2006

7,"After distinguishing himself in any number of memorable supporting roles, Jack Black finally comes into his own in ""The School of Rock,"" a sporadically funny comedy that is part ""Sister Act"" and part genial spoof of all those movies about a ""super teacher"" who brings meaning and purpose to the lives of his students.",2004
9,"The perfect vehicle for Jack Black, a film to show that given the right material he's a bona fide comedic actor of some worth. Plot has Black as Dewey Finn, a wastrel musician who has no job prospects and who spends his time mooching off of his best mate Ned Sheebly (Mike White). When Dewey is fired from his rock band he's left in limbo and in danger of being homeless. But when he answers a phone call offering Ned a job assignment, Dewey decides to take it upon himself to impersonate Ned and take the employment himself; as a schoolteacher!",2014
8,"Can a movie with Jack Black, an insanely excellent comedian, combined with a bunch of insanely talented kids and the insane rock music be anything else than insanely fantastic? Nope. Jack Black really gives it all whenever he's in a movie and he's also a musician, actually. It's pretty impossible not to roll on the floor laughing when he gets his crazy attacks and rock 'n roll visions. The kids in the movie aren't older than 11 or so, but they're already better musicians than what most adults are these days. The story actually surprised me in a good way too, still at the very last moments i thought it was going to end in a cheesy way, but it didn't. It's entertaining and funny from the very beginning to the very end, i can tell.",2006

One of the few movies that I wish was 15 minutes longer. And those kids! They are marvelous! not like the typical kids in movies (With huge crocodile tears). Snow White and the seven Dwarfs, modernized. Jack Black was throwned out into the world because a rock band thought he was too wild. Snow White Was throwned out of a castle because she was too beautiful, by an evil stepmother (or a boring ego tripped band leader, or a step-mother using witchcraft). Jack Black found new faith and hope and energy in all those pupils (Snow White found the same in the seven dwarfs)",2005

I've always wanted to be an actress in the movies so its good for people like me that want to make it in the big times but don't know how to and don't think i have the quality to do that but the movie made me get a feeling inside me saying that i can do it if i put my mind to it. ,2006
10,"School of Rock, well, it rocked! I had to say that I had my doubts, I mean, I love Jack Black, but this seemed like most of his movies where he just plays the typical junkie and probably has either the same or lame humor. Don't get me wrong, I love Jack, just I was starting to get worried about him being type cast. But School of Rock proved not only to be great, but an incredibly touching movie with some great humor.",2006
3,"Jack Black is one of those actors who always play slight variations of themselves. He could be described as a character actor or less nicely, an actor with not much of a range.",2016
10,"When I first watched this film I did not know what to expect. But was entertained and delighted by its content and spirit. My first thought was how come nothing quite like this has ever been attempted before. It had all the elements that go to make a great story,the enthusiasm of a yet to make it musician, a responsive youthful group of teenage, gifted but unrealised musicians, a controlling, misguided, but persuadable Establishment, and in the blend, the unauthorised teacher of the group nearly discredited. To top it all a contest was entered by this new group of hopefuls, and after initial resistance and disappointment, a final electric performance, gave them all the prize they deserved. There,s only one thing left to say, ""they stuck it to the man"".",2014
10,"This movie is great! When I was young I didn't like rock, and when I saw this, it change my world. That is how good it was.I was surprise on how good it was. It pretty much about an low life scum that is in love with rock music and can't stand leaving it. He also changes the kids life's by teaching them about Rock. It could be the best movie I have ever seen in my life. No matter what movie I seen, this would be my # 1 movie. I just wish people could see it. It made me feel like I was Jack Blacks character. It is no lie at all that it made me feel like him. Jack Black is a good actor. I believe Jack Black taught me everything that I know now. He makes me feel like I am the student. But I wish he was really here. Somehow he change my entire life. I just wish there was a way to thank him for that. I also wish I could rock with him. He made me feel like he respect my decisions.",2005

9,"The first time I heard about this time I thought that this was going to be something stupid and boring like many of the live action films produced by Disney. Fortunately, this was much better than I was expecting, mostly because of the performance of Jack Black, which makes here one of his funniest roles. But also, the direction of Richard Linklater was more than correct, creating a film that could be enjoyed by children and adults as well, avoiding stupid stereotypes and predictable plot lines that usually appear on this kind of films. The performances of the children were quite good too, and this movie kept a good level from the beginning to the end.",2010

10,"This movie is a must fo anyone's collection. It's clean, exciting and fun to watch. It gave me a whole new view on piracy. I mean every pirate in movies and plays before this either had a parrot, a peg-leg or an eye-patch. Pirates of the Caribbean doesn't have any of those stereotypes. Depp plays his role brilliantly, there is not a dull moment when he's on screen and Bloom portrayed the love-sick blacksmith perfectly as well. Knightley's role was a bit modern(strong, take-charge feminist), but that also added to the movie, she was great. I could go on about the actors, but there wouldn't be any more room, they were marvelous! This movie is mysterious, every single time I watch it, I can barely pull myself away from the screen! THis is without a doubt, the best movie I've seen yet.(A)",2004

I've watched this movie at least a dozen times and I still can't get over how amazingly well Johnny Depp fits the part of Captain Sparrow. His gestures, facial expressions, and his script make this movie not far from a masterpiece. Honestly it took me 2 or 3 times to completely understand the plot and all the dimensions of the curse. However, watching all the extra scenes and info on the DVD made me realize how much fun the director had making the movie (when was the last time you saw a pirate movie that cool??) Again, I greatly applaud Johnny Depp's performance and I can't wait to see Pirates of the Caribbean 2!",2004

I never could figure out why people kept getting into sword fights and shooting at skeletons they couldn't kill.  Wouldn't you run away if you shot some guy in the head and he just shook it off laughing?  Clearly nobody in this film caught on. Overall, I was not entertained.  It wasn't even so bad it was funny.",2003
3,The first thing I realized when I saw this film was that Disney is running out of ideas for good films. I never thought they would be resorted to base their films of rides in their amusement parks.

1,"The Pirates of the Caribbean the curse of the black pearl, is  a very good film. Everything in this film is quite outstanding, but lets face it, people are starting to get over obsessed with this film and calling it ""The best"". I don't think it deserves to be in the TOP 250, and in a better number than IN America, Henry the Va and 21 Grams. Johnny Depp's performance is very good, funny and realistic, however, it didn't deserved an Oscar nomination. The OSCARS should pick the best performances for the nomination, but Johnny's performance was not that great.

The first time I saw it, though, I knew it would be a hit. The casting was perfect, the music spectacular, the special effects astounding, the story intriguing--this was as close to a perfect movie as I have seen in a long time. It's great fun, making you laugh, gasp, hold your breath, cheer, and sigh, and it appeals to all ages--I even heard grandmothers commenting on how adorable Johnny Depp was! It's not surprising that we've seen more of Keira Knightly, who gave quite a twist to the ""damsel in distress"" role. Orlando Bloom was a pleasure to look at, but his character was the only ""cardboard"" one of the lot. He did OK, and at times was great, but overall he was just overshadowed by Captain Jack, whereas the other characters seemed to hold their own. Maybe he was tired from fighting trolls (Lord of the Rings)? I've seen the movie a good two dozen times now, and it just never gets old, mostly thanks to Depp, who so deserved the Oscar for his performance. Maybe he'll manage it with one of the two sequels. Even if he doesn't, though, this will be one of his best roles ever, and it's truly a movie that everyone involved can be proud of.",2005
