10,"Here is one film that lived up to its hype, and by the time I saw it after it had arrived at the video stores, I had heard and read a ton of things about it, and seen all the awards it had received, and expected a lot. To my surprise, it did not disappoint.",2006
10,"...but oh was I thankful for it!!! All through the movie I kept on having this big large smile sculpted into my face. For the record, I'm 25 years old, and I've read ""The Lord of the Rings"" in three times for the first time when I was six or seven years old. Ever since then, I read it at least once or twice a year - therefore you can count me as a fan, for I follow the same cult fan procedure with ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Silmarillion"" as well. Now onto the movie... Gosh, I saw it more than one time, and I keep wanting more of it. It just never gets boring! I really enjoyed the little stuff that is found throughout the movie for fans of the books (the map on Bilbo's table in his house comes to mind, it is exactly as the one in ""The Hobbit"" book that I own), and I also incredibly enjoyed the intro sequence with the re-telling of the battle against Sauron from the Silmarillion, never has an ultimate evil being been so well depicted on the screen. It truly is Sauron.",2002
10,I think I can watch this film a billion times and not get bored. Today I saw LOTR for the third time and I noticed a few details.,2002
10,"I think it is important to remember that Peter Jackson took up this film not in order just to make a film of `The Lord of the Rings' but because he wanted to make a 'fantasy just like the `The Lord of the Rings'"" as he himself put it.  After repeating that phrase on a number of occasions the question popped into his mind: ""Well, why not the `The Lord of the Rings' itself?"".  In doing this he, of course, set himself an enormous challenge: he had to make a really good `fantasy' film, one which would stand on its own and be true to what he had originally wanted to do but he would also, and here the task he had set himself was enormous, be true to the original book and to make a film which the legions of people who have loved this book would feel happy with.  In the latter task he was certainly not helped by the author or the book: Tolkein, it would seem, hated cinema.  The book itself is `HUGE': this was not going to be the kind of task that the James Ivory team set themselves, or Scorsese nor the kind of task facing Branagh with Hamlet; nor was it going to be like the puny task that faced Columbus with `Harry Potter' who had the bigger budget ($130 million for one film as compared with Peter Jackson with $300m for three).",2001
10,"Barely ever hearing of The Lord of the Rings, I went in to see this film in theaters the consecutive Friday it was released, to not only be flabbergasted at its greatness, but wanting more! Since then, I devoted myself to seeing the following two films on the first day of release -- a promise I kept.",2008
10,Simply incredible. Never before have I seen a 3 hour movie that didn't seem like 3 hours. I read the Lord of the Rings very recently and I was surprised at how similar Peter Jackson's vision was to my own.,2002
10,"Star Wars has been dethroned.  Although George Lucas' movies are good in their own right (except for the juvenile elements he puts in to sell toys to finance the franchise), his scripts (which borrow heavily from J.R.R.Tolkien, mythology & religion) can't compare with the brilliance of the literary trilogy `The Lord of the Rings'.  Granted, Lucas took on a herculean task in writing & directing his story himself, but Tolkien's words, along with Peter Jackson's faithful adaptation & inspired vision, have created something no one man could equal.",2002
10,"The first part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the Fellowship of the Rings opened the door to a whole new world for me. I'd never read any of Tolkien's books when I saw the film for the first time at the theatre and, now that I've read them, in retrospect I think being a neophyte to the mythology made my LOTR movie experience all the more miraculous.",2006
10,There is very little that can be said about The Lord of the Rings that hasn't been said already many times over. But what can be re-iterated is that The Fellowship of the Ring is an outstanding piece of film-making.,2006
10,"'The Lord of the Rings' is one of my favorite books, I have read it several times, and remember thinking the last time, about 3 years ago that if I made a film I'd want to make it of this, but wouldn't it be almost impossible. You can then imagine how strong my expectations were when I went to see the eagerly awaited first installment.",2003
10,"Peter Jackson set out to make movies which the author of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, J.R.R. Tolkien would have endorsed. All three were resounding successes, though because of the film medium they necessarily varied from Tolkien's story-line. Purists may have issues with Jackson's theatrical license, but as someone who has read Tolkien's books several times and seen the films 4-5 times each, I never felt that Jackson went too far or compromised Tolkien's story, the mythology he developed or the wonderful characters he brought to life. Many have said what Jackson did could not be done. He has not only proved the nay-sayers wrong, but lovingly crafted a set of films which will, for many decades to come, stand out as a great achievement. ",2007
10,"Whether it was the opening action sequences or the finale, my heart rate was going a mile a minute watching this movie.  FOTR did everything every other fantasy film should have done; it had fantastic creatures and beings that had previously only appeared in my dreams and my imagination.  Jackson did a tremendous job making tangible what I previously had to visualize by reading the books. Without getting too specific and spoiling the ending, my only critique of the movie was that it was a little anti-climatic.  Then again, the book was also anti-climatic because it was the first part of a trilogy.",2002
10,This film is a triumph in almost every aspect.  I had never read the books upon seeing the film and was a little sceptical about what many people were claiming that it would change the way films were made.  Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring has become my favorite movie of all time.  And I have seen a lot of freaking movies.,2003
10,"Incredible adaptation of the first book of J.R.R. Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy.  I'm not going to summarize the story--there's way to much going on.  All I'll say is they took a verry difficult book with a intricate plot and made it an exciting, totally accesible movie.  The film moves quickly (with a few slow spots--but that's to get in the plot) and there's a lot to take in, but I was never confused.  I should mention that I tried twice to read the books but found them too hard.",2002
9,"The reason why this first part of Jackson's 'Lord of the Rings' is superior to his latter two parts is because of restraint. Jackson was restrained from over doing it with the CGI and ""epic"" battle sequences, which in my opinion does not make a story epic. Part of the reason was simply because Tolkien did not have very many battles in the first part of his book, which thankfully forced Jackson to focus on creating a believable world rather than a believable hack-n-slash action movie.",2004
10,"I've never been a fan of the sword and sorcery genre . I'm surprised film companies decide to make rubbish like THE BEASTMASTER, HAWK THE SLAYER and RED SONJA but I am aware of the popularity of JRR Tolkien's massive novel LORD OF THE RINGS and of it's popularity , I remember in a survey carried out by a very well known British fantasy/SF magazine in 1987 Tolkien's book was voted the greatest fantasy novel of all time ( THE STAND by Stephen King was a long way second ) , but it's a novel that has always struck me as being read by anoraks who - like fans of STAR TREK and STAR WARS - insist on reading subtexts that are just not there . When the THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS shot to number one in the IMDb top 250 films I put the popularity down to obsessed anorakish fans who were going to vote the film a classic no matter what . Stranger still I found groups as diverse as neo Nazis to gays to enviromentalists proclaiming "" This is our film "" so when I finally sat down to watch TFOTR I was expecting only some average entertainment for a non sad person with no political axe to grind . After seeing the film I had to admit THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is a masterpiece .",2002
10,"I absolutely love this movie, partly because the acting is really good, but also for the CGI effects and the good storyline. I watched the extended version and realized that it isn't boring like some people think because some people I know think that FOTR is quite a lengthy movie because of all the talking, but in my opinion, if there's not talking, there's no story! If they just jumped to the fighting scenes without any of the introduction, then you won't know where the movie started from. I love the scenes where they get to fight, whether Orcs or Nazgul, the fighting scenes are still the climax of the movie.",2005
10,"There's a very obvious problem when transferring any book to the big screen, namely that some of us may already have seen it.",2001
10,"...I wasn't sure anyone would have ever guessed (except in a 2004 Fangoria magazine article written by Mexican visionary Guillermo del Toro) that New Zealand native Peter Jackson, the director behind the ""goriest movie ever made"" (1992's ""Dead Alive""), would have been behind the epic three-film installment of ""The Lord of the Rings"" saga, which include ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" (2001), ""The Two Towers"" (2002), and Best Picture Oscar-winner ""The Return of the King"" (2003).",2005
10,"For those of you like myself who are fans of the books of the same name,you will not be disappointed by this movie. Unlike the animated versions that have previously been made where much of the story was condensed either for budgetary constraints or time limits, the Fellowship of the Ring while it does take a few shortcuts, there are very few. It is very exciting getting to see places that up until now have been purely figments of my imagination portrayed by someones elses imagination on the silver screen. I felt myself holding my breath waiting to see the various locations of middle earth and how others have dreamed of them. The movie does a breathtaking job in transporting the viewer to this other world and does so with magic good enough to be from the hand of Gandalf himself. Yes, there are places where for dramatic reasons or to prevent a lengthy historical context that certain events from the book were either shortened, modified or changed. These changes however do not change the storyline itself and makes for a very entertaining movie. I do feel however that if you are one of the uninitiated, it would serve you to either read the book before going, or immediately after the film pick up a copy and read it as it will provide more breadth to the story than what an almost three hour film can portray. In addition, there are several scenes in the book that while not central to the main story, add more to the lore of middle earth and help to explain some of the history leading up to the time of the story. The characterizations in the film were very well done and the choices of the actors to play the hobbits were perfect. While I was somewhat anxious to have Elijah Wood as Frodo and Sean Astin as Samwise, after seeing how well they were portrayed on film left me no doubt that these actors did a very admirable job bringing the characters to life. The majority of the cast has some English accent which was my main concern. Both the principle American actors portrayed a passable English type accent themselves which helped prevent them standing out on their own. How the filmmakers made several average height men such as Wood and Astin, and probably more so John Rhys Davies as Gimli appear much smaller than their Elvish or human companions is spellbinding. Special effects in this movie while at first don't really seem to be that obvious eventually take on a more obvious tone as the fellowship moves further into the adventure. As one would expect from a magical world, many things which we take for granted from reading the books are very difficult to accurately portray in a live action presentation. The filmmakers not only did a good job, they surpassed by far my expectations and truly made the experience an enjoyable and fulfilling one. As with any film where there will be sequels coming out, the ending left me longing for December 2002 to follow our adventurers further on their quest.",2005
10,Minor Spoilers,2002
8,"I've been watching this movie and its accompanying extras on DVD this week for the first time and I thought is ironic that this very American war story should be directed and produced by an Englishman (Ridley Scott) and have a large number of British actors cast as the American servicemen (Ewan McGregor, Jasson Issacs, Hugh Dancy, Euan Bremner, Orlando Bloom.) I suppose it's the equivalent of Steven Spielberg directing a film about the Battle of Goose Green during the Falklands War and casting Americans as members of the Parachute Regiment.",2005
10,"When talking about war movies, there are many great ones that immediately spring to mind. Since the 70's, three of them have formed a bit of a holy trinity: Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now, Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, and Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. These three movies have set the bar for all other war movies that have come along since then. When it was announced that Gladiator director, Ridley Scott, would be adapting Mark Bowden's book, Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War, filmgoers knew that they would be in for a treat.",2002
9,"Unlike most of the war movies of our time, Black Hawk Down sticks to the facts about what happened in Mogadishu and doesn't romanticize the story. To support this observation, the viewer will notice that there is not really one main character. This shows that the film focuses more on what happened in Somalia instead of on the characters personality and/or struggles. Another important aspect of the film that makes it so great is the cinematography. Not only was the setting of the film accurate to the real thing, but the way that the movie was filmed is great because it seems like someone is running along the battle scene getting everything on tape. In addition, the film contains small aspects that one may not notice that are important to the situation in Mogadishu. For instance, the bullet shells that fell from the firing helicopter fell into one of the soldiers' vests, and he scrambled to get it out because of how hot it was. This small detail makes the movie that much more realistic. To conclude, Black Hawk Down is a great movie that is both an eye opener that sticks to the facts as well as a quality film. I recommend this movie to any war-film fan, as well as anyone that likes watching movies in general.",2005
10,"Black Hawk is quite simply the best movie of the year (2001) and the best war movie I have seen.  It's an astonishing achievement that puts you right in the middle of the hellish horror faced by U.S. soldiers in Somalia in 1993. Every explosion startled me and filled me fear, every gunshot felt like it was whizzing right by me, every mistake or unforeseen event had me on the edge of my seat with stress and anger. I felt as though I had been transported to Mogadishu for 2.5 hours and plopped in the middle of the ambush faced by the 100 or so U.S. Rangers and Delta Force Troops as they set about to capture a Somalian warlord responsible for stealing Red Cross food shipments in his starvation-ravaged country. I really felt this movie, it was tangible to me; the confusion, the fear, the sense of dislocation and horror the soldiers must have faced. At the end I was emotionally and mentally drained.",2002
10,"I've just got this movie on DVD - I did see it on the big screen and it blew my mind.  Being from Australia we had practically no idea of what was going on in Somalia, and after seeing this movie and then reading the book - it is an eye opener.",2002
8,"I vividly remembered the news reports in October 1993 of the body of an American serviceman being dragged through the streets of Mogadishu following the battle there . A couple of years later my interest of the battle was rekindled by an edition of the BBC`s excellent history show TIMEWATCH  that spoke to the survivors of "" The biggest firefight involving American troops since Vietnam "" , so when Mark Bowden released his book BLACK HAWK DOWN I opened the first page and found myself unable to put it down , and when I heard Ridley Scott was going to bring Bowden`s book to the big screen I was looking forward to seeing it ",2003
8,I have seen many War movies and I am myself a very die hard Military Technology Enthusiast but I have hardly seen any movie which is as correct as this one. This movie simply gives you the feel of the actual action which went on during this battle. ,2008
7,"Black Hawk Down, co-produced and directed by Ridley Scott, is based on a true story taking place in Somalia, Mogadishu in the early '90s. Elite forces were sent there to participate in a UN peacekeeping action and the task was to abduct two of Farrah Aidids, a Somalian warlord, lieutenants. But it proves more difficult than they previously had thought after two Black Hawk helicopters were shot down and in turn led to a fiasco, a failure that has devastating consequences. Starring as Eversmann is the well-known actor Josh Hartnett, from Lucky Number Slevin. Tom Sizemore (Saving Private Ryan) plays Danny, a tough and fearless sergeant, and as the comic relief is Ewan McGregor (Trainspotting).",2011
9,"Ridley Scott seems to have a knack for high intensity in movie-making (Gladiator, Blade Runner, Hannibal and Thelma and Louise among others come to mind) and Black Hawk Down, a war picture set in Somalia, is another prime example of his knack. Black Hawk Down is a war movie that does something I haven't seen much (or dare I say haven't seen at all) which is not going directly into the battle scenes, but instead keeping the audience in check with how the soldiers are reacting and feeling and never diverging much from the action. It is a daring move by Scott.",2002
1,"Letting Jerry Bruckheimer produce this movie was a mistake. Bruckheimer's gift is the creation of stupendous summer blockbusters with good guys, bad guys, mad stunts and huge explosions. I can understand him wanting to handle more serious material to gain credibility but ""Blackhawk Down"" is not one of his better films.",2007
1,"Nothing short of American war propaganda. Americans are portrayed as like Jesus in the bible, sacrificing themselves to save the world, or so they'd like us to believe.",2009
1,"I find it ironic that many of the comments being circulated from outside (rather luckily, I'd say) the hornet's nest of U.S. news media are doling out the most thoughtful and reasonable opinions on why ""Black Hawk Down"" is such a rank slice of flag-waving propaganda.  Those who say, in so many words, ""leave your politics at the door"" are the ones who are missing the point of a democratic society--even in something as simple as film criticism, dissent is not a privilege, but a right for all people who disagree with the preset opinions of others.",2003
7,"Black Hawk Down(2001) is truly a great war movie. Filmed extroirdinarally with gritty action scenes, this movie is (one of) the best war movies I've seen since Saving Private Ryan.",2002
8,"In my opinion, this is the best movie about war ever made. It surpasses even such masterpieces as Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan or Stone's Platoon. Reading comments on this website, I came to conclusion there is no middle way (there are exceptions, of course) with this movie; or you love it or you hate it. Well, I love it. I can't agree with arguments given by people who hated it, furthermore, I can't even understand most of them, which mainly are:",2004
8,"This movie is a factually based, and done in a way of a real life documentary.  My friend Tony told me about the book, and its pretty close to the movie.    There is a mention(very lightly) about not having heavy armor, from what Tony told me because it would look bad on CNN, and if I remember right this event cost Bill Clinton about 17 points in the polls, he would have lost the election if it was called right away.  I don't think CNN will affect foreign policy again, when they called for the US to help out a country, and Bush being ex CIA chief just wanted to convoy some food and get the hell out.  This movie shows why.  It's not a action movie I would call it more of a war/horror movie.  We see what army life is about, how well trained the special forces are, and the confusion, and horror of war.  The film is one constant feel of fear.  It was accurate, but according to Tony left  some of the grimmer parts out.  Where the troops got lost because the city has no street names, a lot of women and children died because the war lords used them as shields, and spotters.  You really feel bad for the men, and it must have been an eternity for help to arrive.",2002
10,EDITED FROM A REVIEW ON 7 FEBRUARY 2016.,2017
10,"This film was one of my favorite films growing up as a child. Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down hits close to home as I grew up in Fort Campbell, Kentucky home of the 101st Airborne division. Mostly all of the people involved in the incident were from that base including my father who served in Mogadishu, Somalia. I remember seeing the film as a child and being blown away with the visual effects and sound. I have always been keen the quality of film. Meaning cinematography and sound editing have been one of the most important parts of making a film and Black Hawk Down hits the nail on the head. Scott has always been an amazing film director and he always manages to choose the best cinematographers and film editors on the market. With this film winning two Oscars it has proved to be one of the best war films ever made. ",2017
10,Black Hawk Down is a movie that really shows the brutality of war. It doesn't feel like a fake movie about war. It feels as if I'm there watching the reality of what is going on in the battlefield. It is a perfectly edited film with some really amazing cinematography. The score/soundtrack is outstanding. This film is filled with tearjerkers. The movie really brings you on to the battlefield and you feel what the characters feel. The film doesn't really have a main character like other war films. This is saying that war doesn't have a face. All the soldiers are in it together and they all feel the same pain. It is truly a masterpiece! Bravo!,2015
7,"After the success of Saving Private Ryan in 1998, the war movie was rebranded from the moral fable of the Vietnam era to something that was essentially an exciting experience for its audience. Black Hawk Down was perhaps the most extreme example of that approach, a pure video-game movie that pares down all the camaraderie and humanising to just a handful of brief exchanges, and puts almost all its attention upon the actual business of killing each other.",2012
8,"Scrolling through the 135+ comments, I'm amazed at how outraged so many viewers are at the ""excessive violence,"" ""explicit sex,"" ""foul language,"" etc., etc., etc.  C'mon.  A film is advertised as Elvises robbing a Las Vegas casino during an Elvis convention.  How much more lead in do you want? You expect, action, thrills and ... content?  Amazing.  Listen.  This is one of the funniest, outrageous films I've seen in a long time. Yes.  The story's incredible.  But, in any film, we have to consider the level at which we're willing to ""buy in.""  I mean, some people were outraged at the farting scenes in Shrek.  Now, they're complaining because Russell and Costner-- especially the latter-- are too violent.  Well, let's go back a year or so when Russell and Costner both made Wyatt Earp films, playing the title roles.  From my view, both vehicles were ghastly but entertaining. So, I submit that what we have here is the COSTNER and RUSSELL Revenge vehicle.  Costner is always on the leafy edge, whether he's dancing with wolves, building baseball fields for ghosts or water-skiing as bait for sea monsters.  Russell, whose track record in shoot 'em-ups is no less than Stallone or Arnie, is likewise coming off some hound dog roles, such as being an automated soldier, a remake of his Escape from New York (LA?  Why'd anyone want to go there in the first place?) and the sci-fi Stargate.  Now, we get these two guys in a mindless, black comedy, full of S&V-- the most since the cult film Thursday-- with quirky twists and turns.  Mindless violence? Yes.  Gratuitious sex? Yes.  Entertaining?  Yes-- but only if you don't take it too seriously.  I loved it.",2001
7,"Like True Romance, and Pulp Fiction this film is movie junk food that I love to eat.  Film purest will classify this film as crap, and so it is; but this is crap that the masses want and the movie elite hates.  For action films this is great, a few slow parts, and the action scene at the end got a little predictable, with the high kill counts, but rebounds with a great ending.  An old western show down, and being a road movie it gives the junk food escapism I love and need.  The acting is great, Costner plays such a great jerk in this film, his attitude makes the viewer dislike him, like a bad guys in wrestling.  Costner should keep playing bad guys. I believe this is his strong point.  Russell plays the hero or the not too bad bad guy. Russell character is the all American type he acts too the tee.  Stay at the end of this film for they have a bonus with the credits, an Elvis video and a funny out take from the film.   Taker easy, and give yourself a break and watch this film.",2001
1,"I owe Roger Ebert an apology regarding this film.  I was surprised by his review trashing it.  What did he call it?  ""Mean spirited,"" I believe.  He also described a few plot points that I had trouble believing.  I thought, ""He must be joking.  They couldn't possibly have done something THAT stupid.""",2001
1,"This movie is one of the worst I've ever seen.  I like Kevin Costner.  I like Kurt Russell.  But why they made this waste of screen time is beyond me.  Much of it made no sense, like why Kevin's character kills everyone in sight but leaves one particular character alive.  There was absolutely nothing likeable about Kevin Costner's character and yet at the end of the movie the comments the cops made about him made it seem like he was supposed to be a folk hero to the viewer.  I don't think so.  If that is what the writer intended, he/they sure missed the boat.",2001
9,"Blah, Blah, Blah.  Yes, there is a lot of violence and foul language in this movie.  If that is the sort of thing that offends you than don't see this movie.  If not, this was a great action movie.  I was really surprised because of negative reviews.  I wanted to see it in the movie theater, but couldn't find anyone else to go.  I regret now not seeing it at the theater. Costner was EXCELLENT as the bad guy.  Russell was good too.  And there was an excellent supporting cast.  You will see this movie and after you were done with it you will say this movie was different than I thought - guaranteed.  This is a perfect example of critics killing a great movie (it was the violence and language).  One of the best action movies I have ever seen.",2001

10,"Directed with a slightly overused yet still very affective ""artsy"" style by relative Hollywood virgin Demian Lichtenstein, GRACELAND starts with a bang. Judging from the television spots and theatrical trailers one would assume the film revolves around the slowly bubbling brewing plan to knock off a Vegas casino dressed as Elvises on International Elvis Night. But that is where you would be wrong. The ten minutes of nonstop action that are a result of the casino robbery (and in a weird dimension almost mirror the bank robbery scene in HEAT)happen in the first ten minutes of the movie; the other 120 minutes, revolve around the aftermath and repercussions of the bloodbath.",2001

The acting is good, Kevin Costner's bad guy is great, it's well filmed with a lot of excellent cinematography, combined with absolutely perfect use of the soundtrack from minor audio cues right through to the explosions.  This is not a sophisticated movie, but in its genre it is excellent.",2002
1,"This movie is hyped to be dark and funny - I was expecting something along the lines of True Romance or Resevoir Dogs.  I have liked lots of violent movies and lots of movies in which women are treated pretty shabbily. This movie was totally offensive in the treatment of women which I presume was aimed for laughs but fell flat.  The violence is not well done - just shooting of endless bodies with big guns.  Frankly, the movie made me terribly sad for the state of our nation - that we consider this movie to be ""entertaining"" in any sense.  When cultural critics talk about the glorification of violence and the numbing effect of seeing it, this is the movie to which to refer.  Nothing thought provoking, nothing funny, nothing fun.  At best, it is a waste of time and money that you can forget about.",2001

None of the stars do any Elvis songs, the characters ( if you can call them that ) never interract effectively. And David Arquette is beginning to have the Paulie Shore effect on movies he's involved in . I wonder if it's anything to do with him ? I would like to say more about this mess but I am as perplexed about it as I was disappointed.",2001

1,"My wife and I have taken an oath: no more Costner movies without a baseball theme. This was as bad a movie as we have seen in a long time. There wasn't an original idea in the plot, the acting was terrible and it was embarrassing to watch Mr Costner act. I was angry after seeing Waterworld and recognizing what he had stolen from the Mad Max series without credit. I gave him another chance. If I waste more money seeing another movie with Mr Costner, my wife has my advance permission to seek certification for my commitment.",2001
6,"This started with such great style, color and pizazz, I thought I had discovered a real ""sleeper,"" a film I didn't expect to be good that was turning out to be very entertaining.",2006
7,"Costner's best bad guy role since Eastwood's ""A Perfect World"". He is  an Elvis-loving criminal who robs a casino with his buddies and  proceeds with plans to annihilate them all before they can collect  their share of the loot. Simple set-up, heavy-handed execution.  The thing is, though, it works as mindless, forgettable trash. Director  Demian Lichtenstein is clearly churning out his Boys Own Gun Movie and  he does so with unapologetic enthusiasm and not a single concession to  political correctness. Which is refreshing.  As usual, Kurt Russell is fine as the guy Costner underestimates and  gets a world of trouble from. The climax is predictable, unfortunately,  and doesn't leave us with much to chew on, but the overwrought stylings  are the thing.  The shoot-outs are big and brassy, and there is much collateral damage  to be had. The Elvis angle is misleading because it suggests a lighter  movie in the ""Honeymoon in Vegas"" mold; but there is no lightness here,  just nihilism and firearm fetishism.",2006

The combination of modern music to medieval setting should be awful, but no, it works!

Heath Ledger is an Aussie (what happened to the black hair he had in 10 Things I Hate About You! I didn't recognize him!) and Alan Tudyk is a Texan, so their accents should have tanked! But they didn't, just a few slippages a la Mel Gibson in Braveheart or Jonny Lee Miller in Hackers...",2001
9,"I first saw ""A Knight's Tale"" by chance.  A few of us had decided on an ad hoc visit to the local cinema and selected ""A Knight's Tale"" simply because it sounded the least ""teen"" movie on the bill.  We slapped down our cash and took our seats.",2002
9,"This comment is to counter those who have issue with modern rock and other time problems being in this movie. This movie was designed to entertain. It was NOT a historical piece and nowhere does it claim to be one. This is the story of a boy who aspires to be more than what society set out for him. The movie uses odd references to history's great figures and humor to bring its story across to the viewer. So I say that, for those of you who cannot enjoy a piece of entertainment due to its well placed use of anachronisms, I strongly suggest you stay away from any of Shakespeare's works. (Not to say that this movie was on level with Shakespeare...) The makers of ""A Knight's Tale"" set out to entertain, and did so dutifully.",2005

Of course, that was when I had gone in expecting a film like Braveheart or The Patriot, with real historical lessons.  A Knight's Tale was nothing like either of those. After you get past the first one or two scenes, everything really grows on you.  The humor is, yes, cheesy at times, (the Nike armor) but I still laughed.  Chaucer was great, the villain was definitely evil, and the jousting/action scenes were very well done.  Put all that together with some other funny sidekicks and a little romance and you've got a pretty good flick.  Definitely a must see more than once, and a must buy video/DVD when it's out!",2001

I went to see this with my spouse and a good friend of ours because THEY (the spouse and the friend) wanted to see it. I am a non-fan of comedies, and had been annoyed by the stream of trashy Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court films that had been coming out since the 1980s. My spouse had also informed me that I would be seeing Jousting performed to Bachman Turner Overdrive. My reaction was to reach for the nearest bottle of hard liquor. I didn't need it.",2005

Casenove's performance as John Thatcher is superb and touching. Not to be taken too seriously, this movie will please if viewed for what it is- an action comedy.

It is so full of wonderful background, and each time I watch it, I can focus on another area of screen. The costumes of the extras are so great, the expressions on their faces are very interesting. The props and real life buildings are also very interesting. One would think that the modern music would be totally out of place in this film, but it made it all the more enjoyable. I have watched the dance scene dozens of times, and it is fun to focus on a different dancer every time and watch their moves and expressions. It's now my all time favorite movie.",2004

8,"This film has been criticised for having a thin plot, and also for having a somewhat anachronistic soundtrack. These are perhaps fair - not a huge amount happens to any of the characters beyond what you can glean from the tag-line and the music is the 'best of the 70s'. However that doesn't matter one bit. This is, and will always be, one of my top 10 films simply because it is just so damn fun to watch. Ledger is - as always - impressively watchable, but it is the supporting cast who truly make this film great. The ever-brilliant Tudyk is a scene stealer extraordinaire, and Bettany is just fantastic. It's a pity that Sossamon never truly achieved greatness in her career, but for me that just means she will always be the lovely Jocelyn - a feminist icon 600 years too early. Watch, and enjoy!",2013

He plays excellently against the stunning Shannyn Sossamon, who fits perfectly into the modern medieval setting of this film.

I'm pretty sure that when Brian Helgeland wrote this film he knew that the song 'We Will Rock You' hadn't been released 400 years ago. I'm also sure he knew Nike hadn'd been founded yet. I think people are missing the point, because they thought it was going to be a film like Braveheart. A Knight's Tale is a story which is set in medieval times, and as a JOKE, they have mixed in things that weren't around at that time, such as the Nike sign, and Ulrich being introduced by Chaucer before his matches.",2007
8,"Get your nappies off people! All the literary crap aside, this movie is a crack-up. The love story isn't really interesting, but the concept of the film is spot-on. It's such a tight film, with solid performances from the leads/lovers, high comedy from Chaucer and low from Wat, and a real message. When Will realises what he really is - a knight - you can't help but be drawn in to the adventure. The sets and extras are awesome (it was shot mostly in the Czech Republic), and Will's arch-rival has such depth as the villain.",2004
5,"I'm not a big fan of fantasy films set in Medieval times. They just end up boring most of the time. While this one wasn't as bad as most for me, I still didn't like it that much. As much as I admire him as an actor, Heath Ledger just didn't do it for me as the lead. He felt too dry at times, and I just didn't sense the charisma in him that I did in a lot of other movies of his. This one was meant as light-hearted, and it worked in that sense, but I just found myself looking at my watch more than anything else.",2010

Ron Howard does an amazing job of engaging his audience, introducing a brilliant main character, and making the audience experience the reality of mental illness.  This could have been an unbelievable story to which very people could relate; however, the directorial mastery Howard exhibits throughout allows the audience to accompany Nash on his journey and awareness of his illness.  Anyone who has been close to the frailties of the human mind will appreciate how respectfully and honestly this film approaches the subject.  Howard is able to portray all the complex reactions to mental illness while maintaining the humanity and dignity of the patient.

I thought this was suppose to be based on the true life of John Nash.  Didn't his wife divorce him in real life? Yes, she did.  Wasn't Nash a homosexual? (Nash says no, but.) Yeah, right, Mr. Nash.  Let's not use truths here let's just make up some stuff that an audience will like.  Well, Hollywood, I might have liked the movie more if his wife had divorced him or if there was a homosexual tinge to the film.  I needed to feel for the character and all this character was is a jerk.  Hell, he says it himself, ""I have a chip on both shoulders"".  The movie makes him come off as a womanizing jerk.  How can I care about him. Well, because Hollywood says we should feel for him and the media says it is a great film.  That's why we like it.  Give me a break.  I know this day will never come, but, I sure wish it would, when will people learn to make there own decisions about movies, music and tv shows, etc. instead of allowing themselves to be conned into liking something just because the media says it is good.  And, don't get me started on the Academy Awards because all that is now is a popularity contest.

Don't waste your time with the movie, read the book which is infinitely more interesting and gives you a real sense of the human being. Not this badly directed and filmed Hollywood whitewash. Ron Howard is probably one of the least interesting directors working in Hollywood today. So save your time and money, watch the PBS documentary or read the book.",2005

After the film ends, it's almost impossible to keep yourself from thinking of all the possible way to interpret such a film.  It's not quite surreal or full of quirky nonsense, it's more like a set of events, which seem to make sense on one level, no sense on another level, and finally perfect sense on another level.

I've never seen a movie like this. The movie has a beautiful aspect (especially the end). And there are a few chuckles as well. Contrary to the more critical commentary, there is depth and complexity to the story that kind of requires you to see it more than once. I'm no genius, but what I gathered the basis of Donnie Darko to be is about our part in the deliberate DESIGN of our destiny, and I catch more each time I watch it. ",2004

But in the end there is frustration as you realize you were never going to be able to put it all together. There are pieces missing. So while the film, which is certainly captivating and thought-provoking, is often fascinating it ultimately is setting you up for a bit of disappointment. It's nice to have a film which makes you think, which makes you work to understand it. It's also fine to have a film which is open to interpretation. But if in the end you don't have all the information necessary to make a reasonable interpretation that is a problem. And that is the case here. What just happened here? Hard to say. The untidy ending doesn't completely ruin the film, this is still a film well worth seeing. But there's no denying that the ending is a bit of a letdown.",2014

Most people will probably not understand the movie the first time they watch it, because they don't know what to watch for, but the 2nd time you watch the movie most will consider it a great and profound movie. Another way to understand Donnie Darko is to have someone that has already seen the movie to watch it with you and tell you which parts of the movie to remember towards the end of the movie. This is not a movie to watch if one does not like to think during movies. Donnie Darko is also not a movie for the lazy movie watcher to watch.

And then the time travel and the convoluted, confused plot - laughable that the director is trying to (mis)use Stephen Hawking's ""Brief History of Time"" to lend some scientific credibility to this sorry concoction. It feels as if the film can't decide if it has anything to say but insists on plodding on regardless - with a vengeance...

1,SPOILERS,2004
1,"Although I do not recommend this film, neither do I recommend reading this review without first seeing the movie.  Though I have not given away the ending, or most of the plot twists, this movie would be best viewed without any prior information. It's hard to pinpoint the chief problem with the film Donnie Darko, as there are many to deal with.  Richard Kelly, in his first feature film, seems to have collected enough scenes of adolescent rage, late-night stoner diatribes, self-righteous justifications and inoffensive, banal philosophy to inspire twenty teen-angst dramas; then mashed them into a single two hour package with a sci-fi twist.  The result is deeply distressing-- for all the wrong reasons.  The film attempts to lead the audience down convoluted paths without any sense of symbolism or meaning, to make them sympathize with one-dimensional characters, and above all hopes that they will ignore the underdeveloped plot, full of unreconciled loose ends, by hiding it under a veneer of CGI effects and neo-surrealism. The main character, Donnie Darko, is a young man, committed to therapy, misunderstood by his friends, and rendered hostile and disaffected by his suburban life.  We are meant to feel that he is more intelligent than his schoolmates, although sometimes that is a difficult assumption to make. For example, when one of his friends comes up with an absurd theory about the Smurfs, and Donnie counters with a theory of his own, his friend complains about Donnie acting ""all smart.""  Donnie's speech, however, is no smarter than that of his friend-- just angrier.  The only clear evidence of his intelligence is his principal's description of his standardized test scores as `intimidating;' but given the director's slant against simple categorization of human elements (as shown in the FEAR-LOVE sequence), this is a poor substitute for character development. Donnie takes prescribed drugs to combat mental problems, which are not addressed directly in this film.  In fact, the entire issue of the drugs is understated, and one of the first chances the director has to redeem the film is lost.  The ambiguity of Donnie's strange destiny, the possibility that all of this may be a product of his imagination, is pushed into the background, making the film 100 percent science fiction. This would not be a bad thing in itself, except that the ""science"" behind the ""fiction"" is very shaky.  The explanations of time travel are weak, at best sounding like detached, uninformed rambling.  We get the idea that the film's writer once read a book about time travel or a few chapters, and can't quite remember how it worked, but was sure that it was really interesting and wanted to work it into the film.  The scientific portion, as a result, depends more heavily on expensive computer animations than actual development of the theories involved (at one point, a teacher discussing time travel states that if he continues to speak on the subject, he'd be fired.  Apparently no further explanation is needed). Donnie's dealings with a visitor from the future lead him to commit several vicious actions.  The justification for these actions is a tricky business. He damages his school, but it's okay, because his school doesn't treat him like a person.  His punishment of a creepy self-esteem advocate (somewhat similar to Tom Cruise's character in Magnolia) results in the man's public humiliation.  But should the audience believe that Donnie is some sort of avenging angel, striking out against ignorance and debauchery?  He himself seems ignorant of the effects of these actions until after the fact. Aside from these flaws, the film is riddled with flat, uninteresting generalizations of humanity.  The story is set in 1988, just before the Bush/Dukakis election, and the director touches on this point during the film.  The focus, however, extends exactly this far: Donnie's gruff, blue collar father is voting for Bush, while his free-spirited, rebellious daughter plans to vote for Dukakis.  There is nothing even remotely resembling a political statement here; simply a statement of the obvious. The former are not necessary to make a good film, but the latter should be left out.  Likewise, Donnie's heartfelt speech about not being able to lump all human emotions into the bland categories of ""fear and ""love;"" this doesn't ask the audience to make any great leaps of understanding. Everybody knows that there are more that two human emotions, and particular emphasis on this fact is worthless. Mr. Kelly gives homage to several symbols of 80's pop culture in his film: E.T., Stephen King, the Smurfs, Back to the Future.  At it's heart, this film feels like the director's homage to himself, a collection of his own experiences, interests, personal heroes and adversaries, affirmations and disenchantments, roughly stitched together by untrained hands.  Entire songs are played in music video format to the characters actions, seemingly because the director likes the songs.  Characters who have little to no bearing on the plot (including the archetypal bully, fat girl, and right-wing idiot teacher) are given unnecessary focus, because the director really wanted to pack them in somehow.  The awkward mess that is Donnie Darko leaves us wondering if Mr. Kelly has enough ideas left in his head to make another film, or if he has wasted all his creativity in one pointless, cluttered, meandering effort.",2002

6,"Lara Croft Tomb Raider may be the silliest movie to ever grace multiplex screens, but it may well be one of the most enjoyable to. The action is thick fast and stylish, the stunts so unbelievable you'll love them and little pieces of Angelina Jolie thrown in for good measure. The story is a B movie classic, Tomb Raider Lara Croft finds a clock that contains a powerful map. The map shows the way to the pieces of an artifact that if placed together when a planetary allignment occurs grants the bearer the power of God. However the evil group the Illumenati want the map for themselves and thus steal it from Lara. Lara then goes after the group in order to stop them from using it for evil. The acting is the campest of the year with Iain Glenn as the stand out. Jolie is the perfect person to play Lara and looks great in some of the action sequences. The supporting cast which includes Daniel Craig are very much background players but they add plenty of color and fun to the story. The Director Simon West, who is also responsible for the excellent Con Air deserves applause for catching the essence of the Video game perfectly. So sit back and relax because when it comes to Lara Croft Tomb Raider only a churl won't love it.",2006

7,"Many video game enthusiasts were looking forward to the movie adaptation of the ""Tomb Raider"" game series.  When ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"" was finally released, not all of them were satisfied.  But the movie does have its good points.  Angelina Jolie takes the lead as Lara Croft, the famed archaeologist/adventurer, woman warrior and gamer's dream girl.  She plays the role as if she were meant to be Lara Croft.  The movie also boasts some very good visual effects and exciting action.  The plot does leave a bit to be desired, though.  The ancients may have had deep knowledge about the universe and the planets, but the concept with the planetary alignment was just barely plausible.  But, really, with movies like this, it's all about explosions and the star's body.  Lara Croft's game might not be for everybody, and the same goes for the movie.",2002

Lara musts discover and destroy halves-objects of an old relic which can control time and a nasty (Iain Glen) also wants to obtain it with the aim to ruling the time . Lara Croft is helped by an adventurer (Daniel Craig , future James Bond) and by two sympathetic underlings (Noah Taylor and Christopher Barrie). Her dead father (John Voight, like on the real life) will give up clues to find it . She'll have to take on several risks , dangers and adventures until reach her aim.",2005
8,"Lara Croft Tomb Raider is enjoyable camp. All the parts are clichéd such as her evil nemesis, Manfred Powell, her ever dependable butler Hillary, and Wilson, the old man she seeks wisdom from and then betrays her. The story is about a group called the Illuminata who are looking for the 2 halves of a triangle which when joined and after following a series of steps, gives the holder the power to control time and space like God, putting the stability of the entire universe at risk. The plot and action scenes reminded me of a video game and I didn't mind it one bit. Jolie poses in various monochromatic outfits and pouts her famous lips a lot but I think this will one day secure it as a cult classic. The film is if anything, gorgeous to watch, moves quickly, and has an excellent lead player. Finally a film that knows 100 minutes is enough time to play itself out. Jolie brings a depth to the role of Lara Croft that many other actresses would have fallen flat with. And the stunts were fantastic; I was surprised during the bonus footage to find out Jolie did all of her own stunts. She's not only fit, she's brave. The stunts look difficult because they are. I thought the scene where she is being chased out a tomb by water was computer animated, but it wasn't.",2006

She carried this movie on her back and pulled the stunts off with gusto and grace(I want a bungee exercise room!). She is a great heroine. I am inspired to raid tombs myself now, or perhaps help refugees as Angelina does in real life. I hope for a sequel. This movie made me a Jolie fan and I'll see her future films and rent her past ones. Overall, a beautiful film to look at, but doesnt allow the watcher to get completely immersed into Lara's world. I give it a 7...",2002

I think this movie is the best of all. Ever since i watched this movie, Angelina Jolie has been my favorite action star.I have collected all her action figures and i still admire them to the same extent i did when i was young. Her style, her voice, her acrobatic skills ,her gorgeous smile still amuses me. I've watched this movie over 7 times and still i long to watch them. So my action superstar has always been Angelina Jolie. But the sequel didn't live up to my expectations. In the sequel Angelina was portrayed somewhat differently that i didn't seem to interest me. So i rate this movie 10/10 .No doubt about that.",2016
7,"When I first watches this movie, I'm not sure why I didn't enjoy it.  It could be just that I was in the wrong mood.  However, I did find the movie lacking a convincing villain challenging enough to make you root for the heroine.  Indiana Jones had a good villain, Jackie Chan movies always pit him against the odds - that's what makes for good action.  In Tomb Raider, not only is it clear to everyone that Lara Croft is greater than the villains by a long shot, worse still - she joins forces with them!  This creates a confusing scenario where natural sympathies for the main character get thrown out the window.",2003
8,"With Angelina Jolie in the leading role as Lara Croft, and her real-life father (Jon Voight) playing her archaeologist/father in the motion picture, the dynamics are, of course, believable. She, having starred in roles as diverse as a psychopath in ""Girl Interrupted,"" and he, having portrayed a displaced rural dreamer in an urban metropolis in ""Midnight Cowboy,"" the duo perform up to expectations. As is so necessary in an action-adventure, the editing was tight and the sound editing (nominated for many international awards) was tighter.

Besides it being a financially successful PC game, this film was a financial success and even spawned a sequel in 2003. ",2012

All the characters we know and love (or hate) from the original are back and they're constantly being placed into outrageous situations which will inspire gut-busting laughs.

I went and saw the movie downtown Seattle the night it opened at the Cineplex Odean at midnight...that was the best crowd I've ever seen a movie with.  I could usually tell what was coming, but I was still shocked when it actually happened.  I'm usually pretty conservative when it comes to movies, but the American Pie movies have been two of my favorite movies ever.  The second movie takes over at the end of the first year of college.  The first scene can be figured out by seeing the previews, but there were still a lot of surprises in the movies.",2001
8,"I don't think this movie would work, if you haven't seen the first. It relies too much on characters and story from the first encounter set one year earlier. ",2005
8,"First of all, this is (of course) a film for people who want to laugh (mainly at others screwing up). Especially Jim (Jason Biggs) seems to get himself in the most embarrassing situations over and over again. But there are other funny moments too, with the Stifmeister (Sean William Scott), Ozzy (Chris Klein), Kev (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Finchy (Eddie Kaye Thomas). Mainly the film is about what moves people my age and any other age most, the opposite sex. All that obsessing and wondering about the other (does he / she like me, do I love him / her?) is really greatly portrayed and realistic. Of course the people in the film are all not too shabby looking and there are some sick and perverted moments in the film, but you really have to look at the bigger picture. You have to look past the babes, the booze and the parties. You have to look past that every guy's perfect summer' and see that this film is not about sex, it is not about being sexy and cool. This film is about being whoever you are, being true to yourself and your friends, but most of all it is about love. I mean the latter thing may not be true for all characters in the film (e.g. Steve Stifler), but it sure concerns the main characters' life (Jimbo's life). The rest of the film is however pure fun and freedom, that any college student hopes to get. I sure hope my first summer of being in college will rock like that. Can't wait to see the sequel. And again, I do not think I have to force someone to make a sequel.",2001
7,"Raunch used to be so simple! You'd go see Porky's, you knew you were gonna see some T&A. Oh, and maybe a small heartfelt lesson about how people are generally good, even those who are different from us, as long as we have the same goal of getting laid in mind. Those were such wonderful days! Now, everyone's more jaded, even (especially) the kids. You show a kid the shower scene from Porky's, and he'll love it, but I bet after the first few viewings it won't be as much fun. Kids need something new all the time. Now, American Pie is an R-rated film, so at least the intended audience isn't the teen crowd, exactly, but then neither was Porky's (or any of its knock offs). The cast from the original American Pie is reunited. The time is now one year later, and the gang's home from college for the summer. Jim (Jason Biggs) still has his sexual hang-ups. Remember Michelle (Alyson Hannigan), the band-camp girl? Jim went to the prom with her, and she didn't talk to him after that. But don't worry, she's at band camp again and figures prominently in this movie. It seems Nadia, the exchange student whose escapades with Jim made the Internet, is back in the country and is ready to hook up with our hapless lead character. What to do! Jim still has no experience. The guys try to help him out by renting a lakeside cottage for the summer. Meanwhile, Stifler's (Seann William Scott) still trying to hump everything in sight; Oz (Chris Klein) is remaining celibate while his girlfriend Jessica (Natasha Lyonne) is in France; Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) is still lusting after the legendary mother of Stifler, after their much-talked-about union at the party in the first movie; and Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) is aching after his breakup with Vicky (Tara Reid). There have been no drastic character changes, either; everyone's as you'd expect after a year of college. Which means, of course, that all the guys are hornier than a sex addict in a penny whorehouse. But that's what drives raunch comedies - the testosterone of single-minded males.   As in real life, although the males in the movie have grown up, they still think like high school kids. (And someday this nubile cast will learn that that particular characteristic never really leaves the male of the species!) But while the theme of the movie is sex, sex, and sex, hidden under the layer of bombast and teenage oversexdrive is a theme of tenderness and fallibility. When kids graduate high school, they think they know it all. ""Bring life on!"" they chortle with glee. ""We know it all!"" But there's a certain vulnerability that everyone feels at some point, and that's the issue of sexual conduct for the first time. And here's where American Pie 2 deviates from other raunch films. In those yesteryear movies, there was always tremendous pressure for one schlub to get lucky once and for all. I'm talking huge peer pressure! But in this movie, while all of Jim's friends want him to get laid, they never, ever make him feel like he's below average or beneath them because he's not experienced what they have. And that, to me, makes this a very special movie - although, rest assured, it's still as raunchy as the first one.   In addition, the ending is so unlike those earlier raunchfests that you actually sit there and admire the screenwriters for not, for once, pandering to the least common denominator.   But hold on! Don't look at me like that! You're thinking that if it has good intentions and good messages, how much fun could it really be? Trust me, if you enjoyed the pastry coitus in the first movie, you'll get a kick out of Jim's misadventures in this one, too. The writing is way above par for movies in this genre, and the cast is both lovely to look at more than capable in their deliveries and actions.",2001
6,"The first film was a big box office hit and a highly successful teen movie, and many of the fans must have been thrilled that every member of the cast of the original were coming back for a sequel, from director J.B. Rogers (Say It Isn't So). Basically Jim Levenstein (Jason Biggs), Chris 'Oz' Ostreicher (Chris Klein), Kevin Myers (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) have all returned to their hometown in East Great Falls, Michigan after finishing their first year of college, and naturally they attend the party hosted by still oversexed Steve 'Stifmeister' Stifler (Seann William Scott), but this is cut short by the police. With nowhere to party because of the police Kevin finds out that there is a beach house in Grand Harbor, Michigan, so the four friends, plus Stifler for rent, pack their bags and make themselves comfortable, finding work as painters and decorators to pay the rent and prepare for the big party. Kevin is feeling awkward with ex-girlfriend Victoria 'Vicky' Lathum (Tara Reid) back in town and he feels may want to get back with her. Oz is missing girlfriend Heather (Mena Suvari) who is away in Spain and they keep their relationship going with attempted phone sex. Finch have discovered the sexual art of Tantra to keep in his desires as he waits patiently for the opportunity to possibly get with his goddess, Stifler's Mom (Jennifer Coolidge). Jim is worried because Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) will be returning, and he feels his lack of sexual experience will put her off, so he seeks sex tips and advice from his prom date Michelle Flaherty (Alyson Hannigan). Stifler is fascinated to see that the painted house owners Danielle (Denise Faye) and Amber (Lisa Arturo) may be lesbians, and with Jim and Finch he breaks in to find his proof, and they return and catch them they decide to mess with the boys, giving them homosexual acts in exchange for them doing it, e.g. the girls kiss if the boys kiss, and for a while they go with it. Jim's confidence problems only get worse when Stifler provides him lubricant, and distracted by pornography he unintentionally grabs super glue he used earlier to masturbate, and he ends up with his hand glued to his penis, the other to the porn video, at hospital, supported by his Dad (Eugene Levy) he is told there will be swelling for a while, and he is shocked to see Nadia arriving early. While preparations for the big party get underway, Jim has Michelle pretend to be his girlfriend until everything is ready and he has all the tips he needs, and with his penis back to normal they fake breaking up on the day of the party. So the party gets underway, Kevin is crushed Vicky has a boyfriend, Finch disappointed earlier that his goddess was not coming spends his time talking philosophically to various women, Oz has Heather surprise him having taken an early flight, and Jim lets Nadia down saying that he realises he has feelings for Michelle. The party is a big success, all the guests drinking and dancing with joy, with Jim and Michelle becoming boyfriend-girlfriend, Kevin and Vicky happy as friends, Oz and Heather still happy together, and Stifler ecstatic in bed with Danielle and Amber who turned out to be bisexual, even Chuck 'The Shermanator' Sherman (Chris Owen) scoring with Nadia. The end sees the boys packed and ready to go home, promising that if they can they will do the same again every summer, and Finch is happy to say Stifler's Mom, real name Janine, pop by and pick him up to go and have sex again. Also starring Natasha Lyonne as Jessica, Molly Cheek as Jim's Mom, Justin Isfeld as Justin - 'MILF' Guy #1, John Cho as John - 'MILF' Guy #2, Eli Marienthal as Stifler's Brother, Casey Affleck as Tom Myers, Joelle Carter as Natalie, Bean's Larry Drake as Natalie's Dad, Lee Garlington as Natalie's Mom and Austin Powers' Kevin Cooney as Doctor. The cast are still as likable as ever, Biggs more foolish than before, Thomas weirder with his holding in of an orgasm, Scott much more foul-mouthed and sex-obsessed, and Levy in his moments still amusing and embarrassing. The story is simple, just teens getting back together to drink a lot, have sex and party hard, but the slapstick and dialogue jokes still work when they need to, the highlights are Stifler being peed on, the terrible trumpet playing, the phone sex scene, the lesbian fun and the super gluing, it is a fun comedy.

1,"A really lousy sequel to the original dud. The first film is essentially reprised here, with similar jokes (bodily fluids disguised as other liquids, intercourse being interrupted by parents) and with the same unusually bogus characters, a bunch of rich white frat boys. Everything seems so contrived and convoluted that it's impossible to sympathize with actors like dweeby Jason Biggs, who can't get laid properly but still has the most gorgeous woman trying to bed him. And the other principals are either so outsized (like Seann William Scott as the obnoxiously unfunny Stifler) or lame (the impossibly good Oz, played by Chris Klein) that there's no possibility to connect and no reason to try. Only Eugene Levy, as Biggs' father, has some mildly humorous moments, but they're in his appearance and not in his lines. Teens will like the gross-out humor--this is who it's designed for--but it's a case of `been there, done that' and even they probably won't be clamoring for a trilogy.",2002

It just seemed like they pretty much remade the first, just taking it a little further, making it more gross and more extreme, which may work for some fans of the first, but I honestly enjoyed the realness and laid-back feeling of the first far more than the gross scenes and stereotypes. Now, the stereotypes and the gross scenes are multiplied, to a point where it just gets a little tiresome. The apparent lack of any real original ideas, rather than just rehashes of the first, was a bit annoying too. But, all in all, it's an OK sequel, and a reasonably good teen comedy. The plot is OK, but it just seems too much like it was made up just in order to make a sequel to the first. The characters are a little too stereotypical, and not as well-written and real as they were the in first one. The humor is more or less the same, too much the same, in fact, as many of the jokes are just reused from the same formula as the first, like several of the scenes. Overall, the movie is not as good as the first, but it's OK. It's worth watching, if you want to see the characters again. I recommend this to fans of the first, and fans of teen comedies in general. 7/10",2004

The crew of Earth's latest breakthrough Warp 5 starship; led by Captain Jonathan Archer, are making their first steps into the galaxy. Firmly believing humankind has been held back for too long by Vulcan interference, Archer is eager to embark on Enterprise's mission of deep space exploration. Survival proves perilous the farther from home they travel. Outmatched by superior aliens equipped with far more powerful weaponry, this first crew face a steep learning curve. Among their challenges will come Klingon aggression, militaristic Andorians, territorial Romulans and the Suliban; a race receiving aid from the future. This Temporal Cold War story arc heats up with the arrival of a probe sent by the Xindi and seven million people die in an unprovoked attack. With another more powerful weapon being assembled deep within the Delphic Expanse, Starfleet hastily curtails the Enterprise's assignment, sending their most experienced crew in a desperate attempt to save Earth. Along the way, we discover familiar trek-nology from future Star Trek series at a less advanced stage including a crew scared to use the transporter, so frequent use of space suits, decompression airlocks & shuttle-pods and instead of shields, polarised hull-plating. Those coming straight from JJ Abrams' 2009 movie will probably appreciate this uncomplicated style the most. The rest of us get to have fun spotting familiar elements from past series, especially by the fourth season - as we visit the Mirror Universe, encounter green skinned Orions, as the Vulcans gradually come to respect their illogical allies, as they make the very first steps toward uniting warring races.",2009
10,"I read a little about the history of Star Trek and wonder every time about the strange relation between cult status and commercial success. TOS was not a commercial hit back when it was aired. However, after decades, it reached that cult-status that led Hollywood to produce the movie series first, and TNG later. It would be nice to see a pattern, a cycle (or anti-cycle if you wish), in such Trek developments (not to forget about Voyager and DS9 of course) and maybe there is one: at the apex of amount of series, commercial flop once again seemed to have hit Trek universe. Oddly, I still encounter numerous fans of TNG and VOY today (less DS9 ones, but I always thought that one was not so bad at all).",2007

I have watched all Star Trek reincarnations, and I do love every single of the episodes, characters, seasons. I want to believe that part of who I am today is because of the 40-odd years I lived through Star Trek. As others have already commended on this list, it fuelled my imagination, it shaped my motives and my desires, and helped me learn valuable lessons about morality and humility. I never publicly questioned or criticised Star Trek. Never. Even when I wasn't sure where it was going with its plots, I wholeheartedly surrendered to it and let it take me wherever it wanted. After all, I was just a passenger hitching a free ride on this intergalactic adventure. I simply let myself be 'assimilated'.",2008

The series kicked off with the best pilot by far and a bloody good run of four seasons. I firmly believe Voyager had an awful lot of Trekkies turn against TV Trek. This show was carefully thought out and had a good crew with likable characters. The series met an unfortunate demise and was not continued. With Star Trek's history now altered by the latest movie this is the only 'valid' show and should be continued with a TV movie or movies. A story involving a disastrous first contact mission leading to the establishment of the Prime Directive and/or the onset of hostilities with the Klingons would make for great viewing as this cast was top notch and deserves it....,2009

The actor's, on the whole, are better actors, The story lines are a bit less fantastic than some of the unbelievable ones in the some of the other shows. Enterprise is often outgunned, and often the underdog. It has a grittier feel to it, somewhat more believable.",2007

It is interesting getting a retrospective look at the foundations of Star Fleet and what becomes the United Federation of Planets. We see the development of relations between the Vulcans and Humans, and the introductions of a number of classic cultures from TOS, as well as TNG.",2008

7,"I want to give this series a 10 but... I loved seasons 1 and 2 and the end of 4. I felt that most (not all) of 3 & 4 got lost. Conflict is a part of Star Trek. New things always give rise to questions and phobias. However, it turned vengeful and militant for far too long. There were some long standing problems and issues but I felt that one episode ran into the other. There weren't enough stand-alone episodes - which could easily have included those recurring themes without them being the entire episode. I wanted to see a season 5 to deal with the Federation, T'Pol's heritage, T'Pol and Trip, the Borg, etc. My feeling is that if the show hadn't gotten lost we might have had that number 5. However, the quality of acting never diminished. The relationships continued to be tested and to grow. There were individual episodes of seasons 3 & 4 that made me fall in love with Enterprise again - and buy the series. If I had to pick a most outstanding character it would be T'Pol played by Jolene Blalock. Her portrayal of the logical Vulcan fighting pesky emotions was outstanding.",2013
7,"If you view this show as a standalone, instead of trying to tie it into all of Trek canon, it's actually pretty good, and for the most part, got better as it went along.",2008
10,"When using superlatives with this show it is totally fair. This show does something all other movies, shows, etc cannot do: it can safely apply any genre and still function as a deep and very entertaining show. As everybody episode goes by the show only becomes more addictive. It taps into almost every aspect of life. Every emotion is shown; love, hate, forgiveness, triumph and the list goes on and on. In fact this show depicts life the most realistically. The strangeness and peculiarity of the many themes perfectly displays the confusion in life and how it affects us. The show displays confusion in the clearest way making it almost impossible not to some how relate to the characters in the show. Not to mention also the series ends on one finest note you will ever see not just satisfying the viewer but taking the show to a level far and above anything else I have ever seen before. This show does the impossible twice over.",2009

Finally, my ex-husband, who'd seen it, volunteered to watch the last show with me so I could get on with grieving its loss...knowing I'd never see these characters (I mean people) again, their incredible lovely, funky, quirky, unpredictable, moving, funny, loving interactions. Somehow, sitting down with that show made me feel at home in myself and I love myself more for it. So, tonight, I saw the last episode and I'm here because I needed to tell someone...I miss it, I love it, I'm sad, I'm better for it. Thank you Alan Ball and everyone connected with making it happen.",2006

10,"Although it is dead and buried, at least physically, Six Feet Under lives on as simply one of, if not, the greatest television show of all time. Event television is something that doesn't come along very often but the likes of Twin Peaks, The Sopranos and Six Feet Under are perfect examples of 'must see TV'. ",2006
10,"Six Feet Under, HBO's most accomplished and consistently excellent show, ended a little more than two years ago. So why review the show, and learn about it now? Six Feet Under is much more than it seems. A rich show with several layers, it's all about people living their lives, making discoveries about themselves, and of course some drama, romance, and suspense thrown in for good measure. Not only is the show the best and most amazing show in television history, but it is also an incredible portrayal of human life and what it means to live. We live, we die, and the world keeps moving on. Six Feet Under is all about life and loss and all of the emotions, horrors, and realization that come with it. It is at times depressingly realistic, but it can also be beautifully true. There are so many beautiful things in this world, and if you just look or listen, you can find them. You can take joy in your life and make it worth living.",2008

Three siblings have spent their childhoods growing up with death ceaselessly in their home. And as a part of the business of death, they are on the receiving end of the grief and shock of murders, diseases, accidents and old age suffered by the loved ones of complete strangers (mostly). Each episode, save a baby's handful of significant ones, opens with the death of any given person, caused by anything from gang shootings or heart attack to too much LSD, and that death generally sets the pitch for its episode, pressing the characters to consider their present fortunes and hardships in a manner that is clarified by the death and its aftermath.",2009
10,"This was one of the best series on TV. It was such a shame to see it end. I was glued to the TV every Sunday night waiting to see what would be happening. It was touching and hit a lot of spots, it was sexy, funny, serious, and creative. Seeing Nate die was a shock i think i didn't see it coming at all, i think one thing about this show was its constant turn on what was going on, it was always moving around and they always kept you guessing as to what could happen. It was great seeing David and Keith together and stay together. They struggled and had to find their place but they made it. Brenda was one of those characters that you either hated or liked and with that it was almost transitional at times to see yourself being supportive about her and for her. With Nate i think we saw someone who was bitter from the start and to the finish. As to whether or not he honestly was ever happen who knows maybe when he was dead. Claire we saw her become a grownup, taking responsibility and making her way into something good. Not destructive. And seeing her find a good person who would be strong and be hard on her was good to see.. Seeing Brenda grown into an adult who raised Nate's daughter as her own was great, i personally didn't want to see them take that little girl from her. There was so much we saw and so many we saw change before us, it was good to see. It was an amazing show and seeing that it ended the way it did was sad and a true ending. It ended it, and we saw how, it was heartbreaking to see Keith die i cried the whole time it was playing the end. It was a warm, touching show and it will be missed and yet enjoyed every time its seen.",2006

This show is Awesome, Brilliant, Breathtaking, The Best in the history of cinematography, the Best in the world and the Best in the whole Universe. I've seen lot of series in my life - ""Friends"", ""X-Files"" and I'm currently seeing some shows like: ""Lost"", ""24"" and all of them are great, because you can't wait for the next episode etc. But SFU is the best from all of them. Not because of Visual effects or great action in every episode but because shows life, simply life and all of troubles you find out or you will find out in your life. After seeing some of episodes you would like to dance and laugh because you know that in spite of all troubles Life is good and worth to fight to keep it good. But after seeing next episodes what you only want to do is go to sleep and don't think about all the nightmares around you.

5,"My wife and I never caught the the 24 hysteria when it originally aired on Fox so we just finished watching the first season last night. I'm sorry, but are we all watching the same show? How many times can his wife and daughter be rescued within an instant of being killed, recaptured, nearly killed, rescued and then recaptured before being rescued again in 24 hours??? The final twist with Nina being the German super mole is ridiculous--the writers clearly wrote these episodes with little concern for continuity. Why did Nina help Jack at the clinic when his wife and daughter were first brought in and she see's a hit man on the phone in an adjacent room--Nina clearly didn't have to build Jack's trust and all it would do is set her conspirators back so why look for him?? We almost looked forward more to the side story with the senator and his viper of a wife--essentially like the true politics of our time. I will agree--the unique nature of the show definitely hooks you, Kiefer, Haysbert, etc, are all superb, but then doing things over and over and over tries your patience. Then the ending, oh the ending, what a bunch of uninspiring crap! The final tragedy thrust upon us that was Nina's doing betrays any and all trust you had in the writers bringing you some feeling of closure. When the credits rolled we looked at each other and were quite simply p***ed off. 6 discs and weeks worth of watching for such a lousy ending--we feel used. Forget it.",2006

Each season speaks about a terrorist problem, and what's the problem? do they look so much alike? no! If you start to watch a episode with all the suspense and REALLY GREAT action, you'll keep sit on the couch till it's end! Watching 24 won't make you smarter or add anything new to your brains, but will definitely entertain you more than any other TV show for 43minutes and you'll pray till next Monday arrives! If you expect a drama, or worst, a similar show to any of those recent movies such as ""body of lies"", you can turn your head to the other side, 24 only offers what best the TV got, the pleasure of be inside the screen..",2009

NBC is so lucky to have a great show like Scrubs, and I can't wait to see Zach Braff win an award for ""Scrubs."" If you haven't seen ""Scrubs"" then watch it.

Zach Braff is a very talented actor/writer, believe me.",2007
10,I have to say the wrongness of NBC in the case of Scrubs. A show that has been successful for years brining millions of dollars and viewers for NBC. Now when WGA strike'd Season 7 had 11 episodes done out of 18. Now after the strike Scrubs asks from those 7 planned; 3 episodes to wrap up the season. But no NBC had no interest. Luckily that worked rather good for Scrubs. Now we can see a full season on ABC. ,2008
10,One of the absolute best acted comedies in television history. It's a shame that next year will end what I consider one of the most under-rated comedies ever. This show was much more than just about trying to make someone laugh. The story lines for the the most part were excellently written and the actors terrific. I remember the depressed feeling I had when Wonder Years had run it's course. I was hoping Scrubs would last much longer than it's seven seasons. I'm lost as to why this show never had a bigger audience. Does anyone know if Scrubs is ending do to a ratings issue or is this because of any of the cast members wanting out??,2007
10,"Scrubs is perhaps one of the most original shows I have ever seen, and the most laugh out loud funny of all. There are few shows that ever made me laugh out loud, Seinfeld, Whose Line is It Anyway, Mr.Show and this gem of a show, Scrubs. It has the perfect blend of wacky comedy that is so broad, so strange, so amazingly out there and imaginative and with drama that is sincere, devastating and at times heart warming. But what also makes this show great is the amazing cast of characters and actors. Zach Braff is wonderful as the goofy, lovable and determined J.D. John C. McGinley as Dr Cox is perhaps the backbone of the show. His portrayal of a mean spirited yet in a funny way doctor who will do just about anything to help his patient and is the re lucent mentor of Jd, who is always trying to impress DR Cox. The cast also includes, Donald Faison as JD's best friend Turk. Sarah Chalke as the ditz blonde Doctor Elliot Reid with a bit of neurotic mind. Neil Flynn plays Jd's arch enemy The Janitor, Judy Reyes the nurse who is also Turk's girlfriend and later wife and Ken Jenkins rounds out the main cast as D.r Kelso who is always at odds with D.r Cox. This show is just flat out amazing, its one of the few shows I can be laughing out loud to weeping in a span of 23 minutes. The writing is great, the acting is incredible, the jokes, (ecspecially JD's daydream fantasies) are funny as hell. I implore anyone to see this show before it ends next season. Its just my favorite on TV. Hands down.",2007

There are many reasons, from its great chractor development, great story lines and fantastic and real performances out of every single actor, but mostly it is because it is funny and does not rely on what most stupid American TV shows rely on today (Two and A Half Men, How I Met Your Mother which is not the worst but it annoying sometimes) with laugh tracks in this one the laughs just come naturally and you have the ability to feel with these characters, from their loneliness, embarrassment, guilt and pretty much every type of emotion known to man.",2008
10,"l have seen a lot of comedy shows, from Seinfeld to everybody loves Raymond but no show can compare to scrubs. Scrubs is like the mother of all shows. The show mostly has sarcastic and cynical scenes, which is by the way the best thing about the show. But besides that, you can also find some inner spirit. That inner spirit contains friendship, love and mostly Dr. Cox calling J.D. girl's name. So, because of these scenes which involve different kinds of meanings, it deserves to be rewarded the best show ever and what is more important that they continue shotting scrubs for at least Dr. Cox and Dr. Kelso don't retire.",2007

Zach Braff is terrific, a real find as a comedy actor more than ably supported by the brilliant cast. It is surreal and entertaining but also has salient points to make about life friendship and the rest. If you have never seen it catch it-each series maintains the high standard that it sets for itself and is always entertaining. Sexy, funny, touching, rib-tickling, amazing with its inventiveness. All comedy should be this good.",2007
9,"This is by far one of the best comic shows on Television!! It is so funny, witty, sill and also deals with some heavy issues tastefully! I even cried in a few episodes. I love the way the characters show different sides to themselves. One moment Dr. Coz is is making fun of someone calling them ""Betty"" or ""barbie"".. then the next he is seriously concerned with a friends life! One of my favorite parts of the show is JD's fantasy's ... as he drifts off into his make-believe world of hilarity and insanity!! The humor and acting is hilarious and great and the star cameo's are fantastic and keep the show so interesting!! watching SCRUBS makes me want to work in a hospital !!",2006
9,"""SCRUBS,"" in my opinion, is a pure definition of must-see TV! Despite the fact that I've never seen every episode, I still enjoy it. My favorite one would have to be either the one that was filmed before a live studio audience or the one where Michael J. Fox guest-stars. You'll have to have seen them for yourself if you want to know why. Oh, and by the way, I especially love the theme song. Everyone always gives a good performance, the production design is spectacular, the costumes are well-designed, and the writing is always very strong. Before I wrap this up, I hope that all you die-hard fans of the show will always have it live on in syndication. In conclusion, if it becomes syndicated after it finishes its run on NBC, I strongly recommend you catch it before it goes off the air for good.",2006

10,"I have read virtually all of Ambrose's WWII books, and this mini-series faithfully follows one of his best. The experience of these men of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne, was mirrored throughout the many divisions of Army and Marine ground troops in WWII. I feel that this series represents that collective experience in the finest, most forthright manner possible and pays tribute to them all. The acting, mostly by previously unheralded actors, was superb--particularly that of Damien Lewis (Capt.Winters). Winters had to mature along with his increasing command responsibilites, had to learn to turn over his initial company-level responsibilities to others as he was promoted to battalion commander.  It was clearly tough for him, particularly when he had to order attacks on heavily defended objectives, without being to lead his former command directly.   All of the characters were developed enough that you cared about each of them as individuals, and felt the loss of each of them through the attrition during the brutal fighting in the Northern European Theater. They cared for each other as fighting men do (confirmed by my own experience in the infantry in Vietnam), but at the same time they had to carry on with the mission regardless of loss.  Replacements are regarded warily at first, but then managed to blend in with the veterans if they showed they were worthy of joining this band of brothers.  The plot is real, and as such is neither macho nor macabre--it just is presented as it really happened.  The truths of combat are stranger than fiction.  The interviews with the actual veterans, interspersed throughout the series, added authenticity, verified what the series was showing. These representatives of ""The Greatest Generation"" did themselves and this nation proud. Though I knew the story well, I eagerly looked for to each new episode to see how well it tracked with the book and how well the actors and director portrayed it.  Up to this series, I had thought that ""Once an Eagle"" (starring Sam Elliot) was the best war series, but this one is now at the top of the class in my view.",2002
10,"Band of Brothers finds us following the exploits of Easy Company throughout their campaign in Europe, from their inception all the way to the end of the war. The commentary from the actual soldiers that were in those situations is touching, to say the very least. These commentaries also help to move the character development along quite a bit, as it lets us into their own personal thoughts on the situations they faced. This project, to the best of my knowledge was undertaken at roughly the same time as Saving Private Ryan, using many of the same locations and also employing DreamWorks special effects, giving it a very familiar feel for anyone that has seen Private Ryan. As I've already touched on, the character development is greatly due to the fact that this story is not told in a two hour segment, but throughout several hour long intervals, giving us the chance to truly ""get to know"" the characters personalities as the story develops. In my humble opinion, the only other military type mini series' that even come close to the scope of this one are The Blue and The Grey, and North and South.",2005

The second was 'De Tweeling', a Dutch film about two twin-sisters, separated in 1926. One of them grows up in Nazi-Germany, the other in The Netherlands. That movie shows us more of the common persons during the war, Germans and not-Germans. The third was 'Band of Brothers', a true story about combat in the war.

II.It tells the story of Easy company,a group of soldiers who fought in this terrible war.The first couple of episodes are about the drill of the men,the drill-sergeant is played by David""Ross from Friends""Schwimmer(not quite Full Metal Jacket).Then the company gets dropped on D-Day in Normandy where we follow their moves.The serie ends with an episode after the war when we see the company,or what is left of it,""relaxing"" at a lake and thinking over this dreadful period. BoB is very realisticly filmed with great acting,although there are no big names in it.Maybe that is why it is so realistic. The series is produced by Tom Hanks(directed 1 episode) & Steven Spielberg,so it couldn't miss.

10,"I was a little hesitant to watch this miniseries because i'm not too fond of war movies, but this one was amazing! The acting was amazing, as well as the quality of picture. It was made to look like it was back in the 40's. It's not in black and white, but it has that older look. The actors, mostly British, are absolutely amazing. You really feel like you are there with them participating in the battles, feeling the pain of losing a comrade, and the fear of the battle. It starts with the basic training in Toccoa,Ga, and continues through Normandy, The battle of the Bulge, and Operation Market Garden, among others, as well as the liberation of a concentration camp. If you liked Saving Private Ryan, or even if you didn't, you will definitely love this miniseries!! Once again, Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg created a masterpiece!",2005
10,"Judging by other comments, it seems that this miniseries struck a chord with many viewers. I almost hate to add yet another glowing endorsement since the other reviews are pretty much identical...but here goes. This one made me wonder WHERE DOES AMERICA GET SUCH MEN? The things that Easy Company (boy, there's irony for you!) went through. I've always been grateful to all those who fought for my freedom (I served my country but never had to fight) and have wondered how men could do the awful things that had to be done. I've admired those who actually faced combat. Anyway, Band of Brothers is superbly done historically correct documentary about E Co, 101st Airborne. It follows the lives (and sometimes deaths) of the men of Easy Co. The miniseries takes the men through most of their combat engagements. The cinematography is outstanding. Spielberg and Hanks really did a great job on this miniseries! There are some interviews with some of the survivors, who have remained close to this day. Disks 1-5 are the actual miniseries but WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T SKIP DISK 6! There is a lot of information about how the film was cast, the ""boot camp"" that the actors went through and how soft actors were turned into lean, hard fighting men. There are more interviews with surviving members of Easy Co. Folks, this is a don't-miss series!",2002

Everything is believable, both sides are shown, nothing important is left out, being it the Nazi-crimes, war-crimes from all sides, the horror of being shelled or wounded, the breaking of men facing the terror of war, the thrill of fighting in a battle and the final horror of dying in battle, accidents or the ultimate horror of the concentration camps.",2005

10,"when I aw Saving Private Ryan I thought it was really nice, but in general I thought it was too short, and the idea to rish a compagny's life for one person, really sounded too odd to me. Then year it however managed to runn off with all the important Academy Awards. Which was totally an unjustified reward in my eyes. Cos the other film Thin Red Line was alot more striking and realistic to my eyes than SPR.",2004
10,"I think ""Band of Brothers"" is a true masterpiece in the history of motion picture. Not only because of its historical accuracy but also because of its presentation of humans in war. It takes its time to present life and death of soldiers in modern war. The action sequences are a major part but ""Band of Brothers"" true strength to me is the intense presentation of war's dullness, inhumanity and senselessness. It's finally the end of the discussion ""Are there two genres - war-movie and anti-war-movie"": As soon as war is realistically arranged there does not need to be an ""anti-war-movie-genre any more.",2006
10,"How do we perpetuate the honor, the memory, and the lesson of the nameless and faceless thousands that fought and died for their country during World War II? To document WWII as mere history is to marginalize it as merely another fact on an eventual high school exam. To merely acknowledge that it was war merely because war is a terrible thing is to ignore its consequence, and its undeniable relevance to the lives of everyone that followed them.",2005
10,"But then again you see names like Tom Hanks and Steven Ppielberg as the masterminds of this amazing production . Detailed choreography , detailed costumes , everything was there where they should be . It's like watching a really big well produced movie in 10 small pieces . Amazing , amazing , amazing .",2017
7,If BAND OF BROTHERS was made to show the gut wrenching cruelty of war it certainly succeeds . My god what a thoroughly depressing series full of scenes that will make your jaw drop . A young German not a day over 15 looks an American officer in the eye just before he is shot dead . Another German soldier falls wounded under the path of a tank and is crushed to death and German POWs are routinely shot dead . We also see soldiers on both sides with their limbs blown off and soldiers being killed by friendly fire and the whole bleak atmosphere of this series feels like we've been transported to the era of Vietnam or even to the first world war where slaughter felt like slaughter instead of a moral crusade . That's right we look upon the second world war as a crusade against Nazism as if that lessens the carnage and sacrifice people experienced in those days as if that made their deaths and injuries less painful or traumatic in some way ,2005

10,"I've seen the entire mini-series 3 times and never tire of it. The realism of the battle scenes makes you feel as if you are embedded in the history. As a WW2 history buff, I am always intrigued by stories from this era. The fact that these were real people, adds much more to the overall story. Aside from the movie itself, I also appreciated seeing the interviews with the surviving heroes that appear before and after the various episodes. One episode that I would have liked to have scene would have been an ""epilogue"" of the veterans returning to the US and their experiences with assimilating back into society. For most, I'm sure that it was difficult after experiences the horror of war.",2006

I suspect that this version has more emphasis on plot and the older one has more emphasis on the pack.",2007

10,"A rarity--a remake that's better than the original. 11 men led by Danny Ocean (George Clooney) prepare to rob a vault linked to 3 casinos in Las Vegas. His partners in crime include Brad Pitt, Carl Reiner, Elliot Gould, Casey Affleck, Matt Damon and Scott Caan. Also, the casinos are owned by Tery Benedict (Andy Garcia) who is romancing Ocean's ex-wife Tess (Julia Roberts). Fun, engrossing, just simply the most enjoyable film of 2001. It moves smoothly, the entire cast plays it cool and easy and Steven Soderbergh directs it with flair and intelligence. Yes, it's light; yes, it's a trifle but it's so FUN! I really loved this film. Affleck and Caan are hilarious as bickering brothers. My only complaint--Julia Roberts (the only woman in the cast) is shot very cruelly. She's beautiful so why does she look so bad? Aside from that this is a fun movie. Just sit back and enjoy.",2001
8,"Ocean's Eleven is a very easy-going and purely fun movie to watch. The film is loaded with celebrities such as George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia, and Matt Damon. Ocean's Eleven is very ""loosely"" based on the original Ocean's Eleven starring Frank Sinatra. Steven Soderbergh did a fabulous job directing this movie and having all the characters to connect to Danny Oceans group of 11. The plan is to steal 160$ million dollars from three Las Vegas Casino's. Sounds wacky? The planning time took up most of the movie, and you almost believe that it could be done after you see this. Andy Garcia did a fabulous job playing Terry Benedict, the owner of the Casino's where Ocean (Clooney) plans to rob. Brad Pitt plays and interesting role as Danny Ocean's sidekick. The plot flows quickly and some parts leave you laughing on the floor. Each one of the eleven characters had its own story behind them and it is seen when Rusty Ryan (Pitt) and Danny Ocean (Clooney) first go to recruit them to plan this heist. I have to say Julia Roberts didn't have a flexible character but nonetheless her presence in this film as Tess, Danny Ocean's ex-wife, is apparent. Ocean's 12 is due out in December with the same old cast and it promises to be a hit. This movie is one of my favorites because the premise is great and the actors are great.",2004

8,***SPOILERS*** I watched this movie because the guy I was dating at the time sat me down one night and said I HAD to see it. I am so glad he did.,2005
1,"Ocean's 11 (2001): Dir: Steven Soderbergh / Cast: George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts, Don Cheadle: Disastrous remake starring George Clooney as a thief named Daniel Ocean (how clever). He is released from prison after serving time for being part of Batman and Robin, and immediately hooks up with fellow thief Brad Pitt to (ominous drum roll), rob a casino! The casino is owned by Andy Garcia playing Al Pacino and he is dating Julia Roberts who dumped Clooney due to his lifestyle. For every great film Steven Soderbergh makes he tops it with sh*t. For example, Traffic is terrific while Erin Brockovich is overrated garbage. One can suppose that this is his bad counter to his effective Out of Sight. The cast sleepwalk through the charade with Roberts embarrassing in her pitiful grinning in the backseat bull- crap when she accepts the redeeming Clooney. Yet we are suppose to be proud that they pulled together a cast that play like a high school class of roll call. The original film isn't much better with Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin leading a large cast through the same charade. The remake is so much worse in its pointless bull and yet somehow this garbage managed to gain popularity. This is one that Soderbergh doesn't score high in terms of character driven writing, but it can claim to be one of the year's very worst films. Score: 0 / 10",2016
9,"I've always had a low opinion of Frank Sinatra, so I've never seen the original version of ""Ocean's Eleven"", but the remake was pretty neat. The plot of course has ex-con Danny Ocean (George Clooney) getting eleven people to help him pull off a heist in Las Vegas. The neat factor mainly comes from their planning, which takes up most of the movie. Really cool performances from Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia, Elliott Gould, Carl Reiner, Don Cheadle, Scott Caan, Casey Affleck, Bernie Mac, and everyone else, make this one neat movie. Apparently, it has a different ending than the original had, but obviously only those who have seen the original will even know that. Really cool. I have yet to see the sequel.",2006
10,"When you want to steal $160 million in cash from a huge casino in Vegas, you can either do it with force, or you can do it in a sneaky way. Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his gang map out the casino and find a way to get down into the vault without anyone knowing what is going on until Rusty (Brad Pitt) calls the owner of the casino, Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) to state the terms. A large reason for the heist was that Benedict was going out with Danny's sexy ex-wife (Julia Roberts) and he wanted her back. The key to Danny and Linus (Matt Damon) getting into the vault was a device that Basher (Don Cheadle) stole, a bomb powerful enough to wipe out the power of Las Vegas. Not many people would find a movie about stealing money entertaining, but the way that this one was made certainly can catch people's eye. I really think that it is one of the best of the new decade.",2007
1,Why do modern movies not have original ideas? This movie is horrid. Everyone knows that this is a remake of the classic 1960 of the same name. There are so many things that are bad about this movie that I can only focus on the most egregious problems.,2009
1,"No idea why- perhaps it was the needless Joshua Jackson cameo, or perhaps Brad Pitt's sickening ego- but I genuinely couldn't stand this film.",2005
1,"This is a really bad film. First of all, there is the acting. Most of it was rather dull, with the exceptions of Brad Pitt, Elliot Gould, Carl Reiner, and  Andy Garcia. Even Matt Damon--one of my favorite modern actors--gave a dull performance. Clooney was the worst, as the arrogant thief who sets out to prove that it's okay to steal $160 million dollars, as long as its because some respectable businessman who works for his money dates your ex-wife while you are in jail. That is pretty much the theme to this film. Then there is the dialogue. It's just plain terrible (with a few good one-liners here and there, I must admit). Probably the worst dialogue comes at the very end (in Rusty's car). By far the worst scene was near the end, when the robbers are standing near the fountain, it was bad stuff. This film does not even compare to the original. Frank Sinatra is much, much more of an actor than Clooney is, and he's not conceited. The original was better, and the premise was better. I liked a group of army buddies with nothing to lose better than some guy trying to 'screw the guy thats screwing his wife' with a bunch of people he had never before met. The original had the far superior ending too.",2002
6,"Movie goers around the world undoubtably drooled at the prospect of a movie carrying four heavyweight, A-list actors and the hottest director of the moment.

George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts and Matt Damon, this movie was sure to make Roadshow Entertainment a bucketload of money on the premise alone.  It has done so, and while it may not be the world's most original and inspiring movie, it is a solid piece of entertainment, pleasing critics and audiences alike.",2002
10,"After the (2001) Ocean's Eleven re-make they should have left it alone. Lightning struck, but not twice unfortunately. Having a second time around where they get 'caught' by Garcia's character is slightly more than just a little embarrassing. Get my meaning from the spelling there?! It made them look like a bunch of 'Wussies'. ",2006
10,"This is one of the best movies I have seen all year, and one of the top horror stories ever told.  It's creepy, simplistic, and eerie.",2001
8,"The Others is a very remarkable film from more than just one viewpoint. In an era where you can only impress young horror fanatics with bucket-loads of blood and gross-out effects, Amenábar actually re-teaches his audience that fear is especially caused by suggestion and the absence of explicit images. The Others is the first intelligent horror film in years, completely relying on atmosphere and eerie set pieces. It's such a relief to finally see a subtle film that is also effective! I'm normally not much of Nicole Kidman fan but she's very convincing as the prudish, over-concerned mother who desperately tries to protect her children from the outside world (daylight in particular). She lives in a remote mansion and waits, along with her 2 children, for WWII to be over. With the arrival of 3 servants, strange events star to occur in the old house and the daughter spots 'intruders' everywhere. The screenplay - by Amenábar himself - is not totally unique (filmfreaks who're familiar with expressionism highlights from the 60's will quickly guess the hidden plot twist) but it's filled with ingenious findings and sublime dialogues. The Others reminds you of 'The Innocents' and there are far worse films to get compared with, if you ask me! What also is rather amazing about this production is that Amenábar seems so confident! This is his first giant Hollywood adventure with stars in the cast and American money and yet he has total control over everything. The acting is great, the plot actually scares you and the directing is solid. The Others is a total winner and easily one of the greatest genre-films of the last few decades.",2004
10,"The Others is yet another in a long list of great horror movies of the new millennium. I have always loved ghost stories, and this film has easily become my favorite ghost story ever.

10,"It's funny that I see this movie the way I do, perhaps I'm more perceptive to little dramatic, human touches, but I saw this movie and was satisfied with it. In fact, I fell in love with it. This movie is chilling, very spooky, with a few moments that will make you jump, but it's a movie that works itself up, and by the end of the movie you feel scared, and like someone has zapped you a few times, chilly from inside out, but fulfilled.",2001
10,"If I had to sum up this movie in a word, it would be ""chilling.""  The Others is a delightfully atmospheric suspense film.  It's tense, scary, and very memorable -- I don't think I'll ever forget the image of a terrified Nicole Kidman clutching her rosary beads around her shotgun as she tears down the halls of her dreadful Victorian mansion.",2001
10,"Alejandro Amenábar is a very young and talented director, born in Chile and raised in Spain. He revolutionized Spanish cinema when he arrived on the scene with Thesis, at only 24 years of age. The came Abre los ojos, a very powerful second film that immediately put him aside some of the leading directors there, like Pedro Almodóvar, Carlos Saura, or Fernando Trueba. The others is only his third film and you can now see a hint of who may become one of the best around in a couple of years (he's only 29).",2001

An isolated house in the Isle of Jersey, it's constantly enveloped in thick, blue fog, all doors must remain closed, and drapes block the sunlight because the children suffer from an illness in which they are extremely sensitive to it. Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman, finally coming to her own in a story worthy of her talents), wakes up one morning screaming from what may have been a nightmare. Three strangers arrive to the house and they tell Grace they are replying for her request for domestic help -- and almost immediately, though subtly, strange events begin happening and it slowly becomes clear that there are other unseen, unwanted people occupying their quarters. This only becomes more evident when Grace discovers, to her horror, that these servants are more than what they seem to and that her own reality is not what she believes it to be.",2005

7,"Rarely does a scary film come around that isn't schlocky and obvious. 'The Others', directed by the great Alejandro Amenabar (Abre los Ojos) is a stylish, spooky and fun film to watch that doesn't cheapen itself like so many in the genre. It is 1947 on the island of Jersey in England, and Grace (Nicole Kidman) is the mother of two small children, Charles (Christopher Eccleston) and Anne (Alakina Mann) who are allergic to the sunlight, so they are not allowed to go outside. Moreover, any room they are in has to be locked with the curtains shut, a cumbersome task in their mansion with its 50 doors. Mysteriously, the mansion's staff left the week before, which precipitates the arrival of three new servants; a gardener and two housekeepers who are promptly hired. Further complicating matters is the fact that Anne keeps talking to an unseen child, and unexplained footsteps, opened curtains and doors opening and shutting are starting to wear thin on the already uber-fragile Grace, until the occurrences threaten their lives.",2004
8,"I'll have to admit that I put off watching this movie despite being told by several friends that it was pretty good and worth checking out. That's mostly because ""scary"" movies usually turn out to be nothing but crap riddled, cheap thrill fests with terrible acting by actors just looking for their next handout...not to mention directors that care nothing about the progress of their careers. That and the slew of B- horror/thriller movies that seemed to come out very close together along with this movie made me a little apprehensive. However, I was pleasantly surprised.",2004

9,"Nicole Kidman is a lucky girl.  She's got two great movies out there.  All in the space of a year and both showcasing her ample talent.  The Others in particular, while devoid of OTT performances, costumes and sing along songs, will appeal to a lot of people.  People who enjoyed 'Sixth Sense' in particular will enjoy it, and those who're into X-Files' will surely enjoy this too.  However, it isn't a slasher thriller, with some ditzy teenagers running around a school chased by a homicidal fisherman. No, it's much more intelligent and, to me, seemed a far slicker movie than even  'Sixth Sense'",2001

4,"Before I saw this movie today,I read the reviews & they were very positive & given high ratings,so I decided to see it. I was very disappointed in it. I was expecting alot more & kept waiting for something good & scary to happen for the first while.I found alot of it to be confusing. For example: What's the deal with the husband showing up from nowhere in the fog,and what was the purpose of him in the plot? Am I missing something? Also, how come ""Ann"" was the only one to see the intruders? I left the theater trying to figure it all out. On the other hand alot of it was copied from other movies & predictable. I did not feel scared during this film overall. It had only a few creepy moments worth mentioning. One of them can be seen on the 30 second tv spot.(Ann as the old woman with the white vail) The other is the photo album that Grace(Kidman) finds. That was creepy!",2001
1,"I guess people are really easy to please because there are so many good reviews for this movie. Well - I am hear to warn you that this is not either good, entertaining or original. If you can't figure out the ""surprise"" ending which has been done a trillion times before ('Carnival of Souls' 1962, 'Voices' 1973, an episode of 'The Twilight Zone' 1959, 'the Sixth Sense'1999, etc....) then you mustn't watch many movies. This movie is long and boring if you don't know the ending and if you are like most people and see it coming in the very beginning of the film then it is excruciating to sit through. It has been called ""spooky"" and ""eerie"" and ""atmospheric"" by other reviewers - but in my opinion it is over produced and in your face and at no time let me forget I was watching a movie.

I said to him, ""Let me guess the ending, I think I know it."" I was able to guess the ending with great detail. Seem impossible? Well not exactly, you see I was able to put together the ending and the plot just from the commercial and the coming attractions for it. I finally decide to see the movie because I wanted to be able to critique it. So I pay for my ticket and go watch the movie. It was so bad. Nicole Kidman cannot act.

10,It's one of the best TV shows I've seen. I watch it several time. It's so engaging and educational without losing the sense of humour and its main aim: make people laugh I recommend it to those are tired of lame comedies. Those some young fellows turn on and off girlfriend boyfriend relationships. Those are funny no doubt but they are just comedy nothing extra you gain watching them. It's not the case with Reba though. I can compare it to 10 Simple Rules to Date my Teenage Daughters. These two series are rare in American media. Giving value to family is not common in American TV shows. Most of them are based on humour nothing more. Hope I see more like Reba. I'm not hopeful though. People now are forced to see modern ones those with fake gay characters.,2013

This show is only for those American people who haven't ever heard that there are far more funnier, better and wittier comedies - not only in Great Brittain, but also in America (The Simpsons for example). I simply can't understand what is so good about ""Reba"" that it has lasted for long a while in television. It has nothing new to offer, it underestimates the (possible) viewers in so many ways and it simply isn't funny at all. I could have lived with the fact that there are so bad shows as ""Reba"", but why the hell they had to run it here in Finland. If I see few seconds of this horrible show the rest of the day is ruined for me. Take my word and believe me - this show sucks ass even more than these kind of American ""comedies"" usually does. This is simply horrible. Do yourself a favor; don't ever watch this peace of sh*t. ",2006
8,"Firstly, if I see another review labelling Ghosts of Mars, Vampires or Escape from L.A 'Carpenter attempting to have another hit movie' my head will explode like Snake Plissken's would have done. Hello people: CARPENTER HAS NEVER HAD A HIT MOVIE! Besides maybe Halloween, Starman, Christine and Escape from New York to a lesser extent, Carpenter has made bomb after bomb. Certainly the films that have the biggest following today; The Thing, Big Trouble in Little China, They Live, they all were torn apart on release. So, surprise surprise everyone hates Ghost of Mars like they did The Thing. Now, I am in no way comparing Ghosts to The Thing, which is an vastly superior film. But Ghosts is in the same position; as it will be in fifteen years time when people will look back on it and say 'Maybe it wasn't that bad.' WHICH IT ISN'T. What elements in this film aren't Carpenter? The western atmosphere? The focus on action and story, and not character? Vast hoards of nameless enemies? These were all in Assault on Precinct 13. Oh wait, no one liked that in 1976 because they were so brain dead they had to wait for a cult following to develop before they gave it a second chance. So it must be the structure. Is the structure, with it's flashbacks-within-flashbacks and weird editing any more bizarre than the corkscrew science behind 'Prince of Darkness'? Oh that's right, everyone hated that in 1987. So I'm looking for the faults. That's it, the action isn't very good. Oh damn, it wasn't very good in 'Big Trouble in Little China' either. Wait, didn't it take people fifteen years to 'get' that film as well? Maybe it's the fact that it has Ice Cube in the lead. Yeah, Carpenter defiantly shouldn't have let a non-actor take the leadoh wait, Roddy Piper! If 'They Live' was made in 2001 that would be bashed for having an non-actor carrying it, but for some reason because it was made in 1988 (blasted on release) Roddy Piper's performance is the stuff of cult legend.",2005
3,John Carpenter has made a pretty decent living out of directing low-budget action-horror flicks in various sub-genres. A couple of his sci-fi efforts are genuinely good fun. This movie isn't one of them.,2017
7,"A team of future cops take a bullet train to a Marsian colony to retrieve a murderer played by Ice Cube. Upon arrival they're attacked by colonists possessed by the Ghosts of Mars. John Carpenter's penultimate theatrical feature to date is easily one of his best, considering the odds against it. The film borrows from Total Recall, The Thing and Assault on Precinct 13, but still looks fresh and original. The pace is steady and the mood consistent. The electronic/metal score recorded by Carpenter and Anthrax, while being uncharacteristically modern, still is very much signature Carpenter. The glorious Panavision cinematography is fresh just like it was in the 80s. The (then) young stars Natasha Henstridge, Ice Cube, Jason Statham and Clea DuVall fit their roles perfectly, most notably Henstridge, who effortlessly portrays a woman in command and *not* a tough chick with a chip on her shoulder. The seasoned actresses Pam Grier and Joanna Cassidy add a punch here and there. Ghosts of Mars leans closer to Escape from LA on the fun meter, but retains the quality and edginess of The Thing. A good movie.",2011
7,"Mars has fascinated humans for years.  It's the closest planet to us, and the only one that comes close in terms of livability.  Its forbidding landscape and dire red color scheme are magnetic (at least in movies; I can't tell you how disappointed I was when that little NASA toy-car thing sent back pictures and Mars looks like Utah.  No red sky, even.)",2001
10,"First of all, i have to say that John Carpenter is a brilliant, flawless director because his every shot, every scene, narrative style is perfect, whatever he wants it's on screen. I know, then why his movies are flops at the theatrical release? - 'cause there's a problem with us(people) to understand his films that are really old-fashioned aiming rather at the people in the 60's-70's and that's the only Carpenter's flaw as a director, his bad timing(maybe born out of time). But when his movies at its core are good it's only a matter of time to be fancied. I think we should start appreciate such a director who's devoted to an old genuine film-making and not to these days where everything has to be big, right in your face. I love his subtle style especially in future classic as Ghosts Of Mars. This film is very essential: it represents every directorial aspect what John Carpenter uses in other films(hardy women equal to men, defiance against authority etc..), but it's not just a hotch-potch of his early works it has its own low-key style and Forbidden Planet-like feel, it combines genres Sci-fi, Horror, Western, Action, Comedy, it has a message(perhaps Carpenter's biggest at all) that beautifully reflects us. I know it is a B-Movie, it has a silly dialogue, silly situations but that's exactly what Carpenter wanted and he takes all these elements to encapsulate into its own form and never let it slip out, it never tries to be serious, it never tries to be something what it's not, there's nothing what doesn't fit in (that's what i can't say about for example Kill Bill), something what should these young filmmakers learn from. i've been watching Carpenter films since the early 80's and still like them all so i'm deadly serious when i'm rating Ghosts Of Mars as a masterpiece and one of his best that will certainly stand the test of time especially for its form and uniqueness. ",2004
1,"*** MUST READ BEFORE PAYING REAL MONEY *** John Carpenter was once a really good filmmaker, well at least a good director. Just think of the 1982 classic ""The Thing"", which is simply excellent. He didn't write that movie, but the cinematography is very good. Unfortunately he DID write ""John Carpenter's Vampires"" a few years back, and it sucked. It sucked bad. He also wrote ""Ghosts of Mars"" (referred to as GOM from now on), which sucks even more. I'm a fan of horror, sci-fi, monster movies and dramas.",2001
4,"well i went to see this when it came out  in the theatre with some friends and they wanted to leave halfway through the movie because of the absolute dragging on of the set-up of the story.well i left with them always wondering what happened in the second half.i rented the dvd when it was released and wished i had stayed the first time to watch the entire picture.i have since bought the dvd and watched the special features[which has the some behind the scenes footage,special effects,and making of the soundtrack]which include the commentary by mr carpenter himself and his lovely star natasha.carpenter explains that he had a real hard time with the first part of the movie.he wanted to get things moving along but he was also trying to develop the characters and set up the movie as well.the flashback scenes were really wearing me out though and this is not shot like a typical carpenter movie.carpenter has always been a master in creating and building up suspense but,it doesn't quite work in this movie.it would have helped if the dialogue had been a little more interesting but it is pretty straight-forward stuff.when we finally get to the action sequences carpenter himself says in the commentary""FINALLY INTO THE ACTION PHASES"".even carpenter was really ready for the action pick up.the fight scenes are top-notch and the special effects get kicked into high gear during this second half of the movie.also there is some pretty funny humor during this time which seems to work.during the commentary carpenter keeps heaping praise on his lovely star ms natasha.she does do a good job and considering the fact that she was a last minute addition to the cast{only one week before filming}her performance is worthy of praise.one thing to keep in mind DO NOT TAKE THIS FILM SO SERIOUSLY.this is  something that carpenter told his cast and should be told to viewers.yeh it's a little monotonous during the early stages but the payout later is worth it.not carpenters' best movie or worst.village of the damned i thought was his poorest but i have since changed that because like this movie it grows on you.",2002
9,"Sometimes you want a deep film, sometimes you want escapism and a few shocks and thrills. Ghosts of Mars fits the bill perfectly. It is a very easy film to get into. The tension is palpable as along with the characters you see things rapidly going downhill on this mars colony but don't know exactly why, what is doing this. This leaves ones imagination to fill in the blanks, all you know is that crazyness is everywhere. The sense of dread and tension in the film is palpable as you feel the Ghosts of Mars closing in on the heroes. The film moves along at a good pace and when things finally reach their boiling point the movie delivers the goods in an all out action tour de force.",2008
7,"John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars never appeared in the theaters of Turkey,have seen the movie on DVD about two years ago.As a big John Carpenter fan,enjoyed the movie from beginning to end.The movie has all the basic elements which we look for in a Carpenter movie;a cool anti-hero,a beauty in the lead,raw action,some effective scares and of course great Carpenter dialogs.(cheesy but very smart)Also the movie has a strong and effective Carpenter score like most of his movies.As you can guess from the headline,the movie is a brief summary of his earlier works.The plot reminds us one of his very best movies;Assault on precinct 13 which is now considered as a cult classic and which caught a minor attention before Halloween.Like his masterpiece about human nature and paranoia;The Thing,the story is set in a resurrected area where the characters are all by themselves.Carpenter created almost the same atmosphere just like he did in Assault on precinct 13 by making the criminals and the police squad fight against the enemy together.Finally,Ghosts of Mars can be considered as a weak chain in Carpenter's career by some of his fans but if you sit on the couch just to have a good time without thinking much,the movie gives plenty of excitement.Remember,it's a Carpenter flick from beginning to end.",2006
7,"Yeah Ghosts of Mars! Liked the movie a lot.Liked the soundtrack, the heavy angst ridden sounds fit real well with the surreal psychedelic imagery and well accent the bleak horror of being in a situation where the force to fight against is super horrific and unseen.There is nowhere to go and no way to survive except to fight in an all out only the strong and fast can survive,shoot,splatter,and chop mode.This is reminiscent of the bleak and inescapable horror of John Carpenters masterful remake of ""the Thing"".It put me in the space of hopelessness and despairing odds.A tailor-made""B"" movie of excellence.This movie reminded me of one of my favorite authors of science fiction and horror,Mick Farren.Specifically his book ""Mars-The Red Planet"".The storyline and imagery are similar.If you liked ""Ghosts"",then you might want to check out this Del Ray book,out of print but available in used condition. Anyways Kudo's to Carpenters Ghost's of Mars",2005
8,"This is how to make a hybrid of action, horror and science fiction. John Carpenter knows exactly how to set a mood, and, as proved by this film, also knows how to direct good action. The plot is not really new, but it's not a story that's been done to death either. The actors all perform pretty well, considering that most of them are B-list actors. The special effects are great. The music is perfect for the film; John Carpenter knows the importance of a good score. The atmosphere is incredible; any fan of Carpenter's earlier work will at the very least enjoy it. The film is exciting and scary at the same time; a thing most other films can't accomplish. The action is well-choreographed and cool. The story is told in a reasonably original fashion, and it works perfectly. The pacing is great. The humor is very dark and cynical, and fits perfectly with the overall mood of the film; very good decision by Carpenter. I'd recommend this to any fan of action, horror, science fiction or John Carpenter. Just keep an open mind about it; it's a bit different from what you might expect from these genres. 8/10",2004

8,"It's 3 AM on a midsummer's night and I just watched Carpenter's ""Ghosts of Mars from television. Please excuse me for any errors in this review, but I'd like to say this now. This movie could be described as hardcore action movie. It is important to say that it's not about bad manners but meaningful bad manners. Some modern scifi movies such as ""Pitch Black"" has meaningless posturing and insulting and bad manners, but in this movie people insult others with a grin. On some occasion the director even lets the viewer's nerves rest with compassion and gentleness. This is an intelligent action movie which takes a lot of nerve with it's sharp Carpenter-style violence and brutality, and perhaps suits best for people who choose to listen heavy rock and hang out with motorcyclists. Perhaps too hardcore for my taste. Still, this movie is A, not B as some have said; a classy movie with the vision of a great director. It is very consistent and the scifi features are captivating.",2005
10,"Ghosts Of Mars is not John Carpenter's best film however it has to be one of his most visually interesting and action packed. The basic idea is much like Carpenter's earlier film Assault On Pericent 13 however it has some new twists. In the future Mars is a colony and humans are living and mining there. A group of cops are sent out to a mining town to transport a criminal back to the city. The first hour of this movie is all about building the characters and the atmosphere. Most of the characters are not very well developed besides Ice Cube and Jason Statham characters and Nastaha Henstridge is just hot and fun to watch as the leader. After some build up the movie goes from creepy outer space thriller to good old classic hard hitting action with a cool mean heavy metal soundtrack. The last half of this movie never lets up and the ending while isn't original it works very well. If your looking for something deep about space and ghosts look elsewhere, the title is Ghosts Of Mars this movie isn't to be taken seriously. All you need to know is the story takes place on Mars, there are ghosts and plenty of Carpenter action and fun.",2004
1,"Okay, I saw a number of reviews by some kids who claim that they know Carpenter's work and review this movie, while they have only seen 'Vampires' and 'In the Mouth of Madness', so I decided to write a second review here.",2002
7,"John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars has Natasha Henstrige (the Species babe) as a Lieutenant of a police force on mars that is assigned to transport a prisoner (Ice Cube in good leading form) from a city compound, but they find that is the least of they're problems as they encounter a whole army of zombie monster types that are really just possessed ghosts.",2001
7,"This is one I can remember going to the theater as a freshmen in high school. As a long- time fan of John Carpenter and oddly Ice Cube, the combination was enough for teenage-Denham to count down the days until it released at one of the two theaters in Baton Rouge (now, there are six theaters thanks to the rapid growth in our population after Katrina).

10,"Okay, I am not from India, not even close. I am from Scandinavia. Before Lagaan I had never watched any Hindi movies of any kind. I know about 3 words from the hindi language. And I don't like musicals much. I viewed the movie on a DVD of rather poor quality compared to the state of the art DVDs I am used to. And I was told the movie lasted close to 4(!) hours... I figured this would be a complete waste of time... BOY was I wrong! This movie is completely the opposite! It is just amazing! Mr. Gowariker has selected an incredible cast with Aamir Khan in the lead. He makes an stunning performance as the village rebel, Bhuvan. He tries to unite the village in a struggle for life against the greedy Britons. The Britons exploit the villages by collecting lagaan (tax). This means that most of the harvest surplus is gone and there is just enough left for food for the farmers themselves. It's a classic war between ""David"", the native villagers of India, and ""Goliath"", the powerful and greedy Britons. But what makes it really interesting is that this war is fought in a Cricket arena. This is a challenge from the Britons, who are well known with Cricket, against the village, where most people have never laid eyes upon a cricket bat. If the villagers win, there will be no lagaan at all, for three years! And if the Britons win, they will collect triple lagaan, which will mean the end of the village.  The stakes could not be higher!!",2002
8,The setting is historical The year is 1893 The British Raj imposes heavy taxes on the poor villagers despite all the problems droughts have caused on their income ,2008
10,"In 1893, India was a colony of England. The starving native farmers had to pay an imposed tax to the British soldiers for the protection of their lands, delivering most of their harvest to the British Queen. In those years, the lands were very dry due to the lack of rain, and the inhabitants of Champaner decide to request to their Rajah Puran Singh (Kulbhushan Kharbanda) to waive the taxes. While waiting for the Rajah, Bhuvan (Aamir Khan), the beloved friend of Gauri (Gracy Singh), comments that the silly game of cricket was a stupid game, comparable to the Indian child game 'gilli-danda'. The nasty and arrogant Captain Andrew Russell (Paul Blackthorne), who had had a previous discussion with Bhuvan, listens to his comment and challenges Bhuvan to play a match against the British team, imposing the following condition: if the natives win the game, they would not need to pay Lagaan for the next three years. Otherwise, they would triplicate their payment in that year. Bhuvan accepts the bet despite of the opinion of his people. The sister of Captain Russell, Elizabeth Russell (Rachel Shelley), finds the competition unfair to the Indians and decides to help Bhuvan and his friends, teaching them how to play cricket. ",2004
9,"LAGAAN (4+ outta 5 stars) Years of subjugation and unfair taxation by the British Empire come to a head and the inhabitants of a small Indian farming community face off against their evil oppressors... in a cricket match??? This may seem like a ridiculous idea for a movie (and I won't even mention the fact that it's a musical) but this was the most exciting and wonderful movie I've seen in quite some time. Yes, it all comes down to a cricket match between the upper class British twits and the neophyte Indian farmers... and the movie is almost FOUR HOURS long... but, wow... what a movie this is! The slow building of trust and community among the usually-bickering villagers as they prepare for their ultimate battle is both fascinating and inspiring. It's like watching The Magnificent Seven or The Wild Bunch gathering together for a big showdown... only instead of shooting and killing... there's cricket! A cocky British Captain (Paul Blackthorne) makes a deal with the proud, young Bhuvan (Aamir Khan): he will give the entire region three years of no taxes if they can defeat the British cricket team... but if they lose they have to pay triple tax this year. Since there has been no rain all season and they can't even pay their regular taxes... this becomes a tense, do-or-die situation. Aamir Khan is terrific in the lead (he resembles a cross between Tony Curtis, Peter Sellers and Al Pacino). He is always believable, whether trying to inspire his fellow villagers or facing his English enemies in stony silence or wooing his the lovely Gauri (Gracy Singh) with song and dance. Great story! Great music! Don't miss this one!",2005
9,"Initially I was warned about the length of the movie-3hrs and 50 mins.But believe me, its worth it.There is a refreshing Indian-ness about the movie,which is welcome after a recent bout of Hollywood remakes in Hindi that have become such an eye-sore.",2001
8,"This is actually the first ever film I have seen where the audience clapped cheered and booed effectively as if they were a part of the actual proceedings in the film. I heard someone say that they felt that they were really at a cricket match. I loved the movie even though admittedly at the time (surprising for an Indian) I didn't know cricket at all...I learned while watching it with the help of a friend but also found I didn't need to! It certainly renewed my interest and made mea cricket fan soon enough, the next match that year I watched with grave interest.",2003

It's not as warm and colorful as K3G or as funny as Main Hoon Na, but the story is so involving that I spent almost four hours anxiously following the main characters' efforts to win the game. I almost started to bite my nails at the end, keeping thumbs up for Bhuvan and his friends! The strength of the film lies in the fact that it shows how important cooperation, faith and effort are if you want to achieve something in your life. And although I, as a Pole, have no idea whatsoever about the rules of the game of cricket, I was not bored for a second during the second part of the movie - thanks to the director's ability to introduce tension at the right moments. I liked the songs a lot and I think they've been nicely choreographed. The camera work is good, emphasizing the dryness of the land and the hopelessness of the people anxiously waiting for the rain. To sum up, it's a good film with an interesting plot, some catchy music and nice acting. A must-see for a Bollywood fan.",2006
9,"I saw this in a Paris cinema on a Sunday afternoon. The French audience loved it, as did I. They clapped at the intermission and they clapped to the music while the credits were running. I thought the song and dance routines were great, providing the perfect bridge to a semi-mythologised narrative. The audience sometimes laughed at the exaggeration and coincidence of the plot, especially at the end -- the rain, the Englishwoman who never married. Astonishingly they even got the joke about 'this country will be the future of this game'. It seems that lack of knowledge of cricket and subtitles with words like 'runs', 'overs' and 'no ball' were not a handicap. Of course the pillorying of the British didn't go down badly here. I especially liked the representation of the Raj, not as a moderrnising influence, but as straight agrarian civilisation, extraction of the food from peasants' mouths.",2002

I have never really been a fan of any of the actors, which would probably explain why I didn't catch ""Frailty"" when it was still in its first-run.

In this world of bizarre cults, religious fanatics, weekly Armageddons, etc., it would be easy to imagine a misplaced, misguided, or just plain crazy guy declaring his intention to heed the word of the Lord and start killing ""demons."" The fact that he dragged his two young sons into this carnage made it all the more sick and twisted - especially the younger boy, whose enthusiasm for his father's ""mission"" turned my stomach. Only Fenton, the older boy, seemed to have a conscience. However, thanks to a wonderful script and excellent direction, we find out that even this is not exactly the truth. Or is it? The ending of the film, when the viewer discovers that each of the so-called ""demons"" executed by Mr. Meiks was indeed a murderer, leaves room for doubt about the sanity everyone involved (including the detective with matricidal tendencies). I am almost middle-aged, and have only sat through three movies that left me with the creepy and distinct feeling that I will probably burn in hell just for viewing them. ""Rosemary's Baby"" is one, followed by ""The Seventh Sign,"" and now ""Frailty.""",2011
10,"Stunning. Absolutely stunning. This is a movie about two kids who's father suddenly has a vision. He claims an angel visits him, and tells him that they need to kill ""demons"". He gets instructions later, and they start rounding up the demons, which are, to the naked eye, ordinary people. They kill these so-called demons with an ax to the head, and chop them up, burying them in the rose-garden. Their father claims he can see their sins when he touches them. The movie continues, with a twist at the end.",2006
9,People have different perceptions when they evaluate movies. I will only tell you what I felt when I saw this Close to Masterpiece Motion Picture.,2009
8,"In rural Texas, a man contacts an FBI agent claiming to know the identity of the ""God's Hand"" killer, an unknown serial murderer who claimed victims beginning in 1979, and has recently had a second insurgence. He recounts his disturbed childhood, detailing his father's belief that he, himself, and his brother were chosen by God to eradicate the ""demons"" on earth.",2015
5,"This movie made me really quite angry. Technically, it's well done and it has some scenes that will have you at the edge of your seats. But who the hell financed its making? The ""United States Christian Serial Killer Association""?? The movie seems to be saying that guys who kill a lot of people, claiming that God told them to do it- are probably right! They know things you and I don't. Hello?? What kind of message is THAT? That the brother showing up at the office of the Powers Boothe character turns out to be the younger brother who naively went along with the lunacy of his father from the beginning was a nice plot twist, but what follows as soon as they reach the notorious rose garden is an insult to the audience. Even if you're a Christian -which I am not- there can't be any justification for the message this movie's ending is sending, what with ""Thou shalt not kill"" and all...these self-styled demon-killers would roast in hell.",2005
7,"Frailty suffers somewhat towards the end of the film by confusing the story into a guessing game of which guy is which (McConaughey is a part of this not to spoil anything important), but for the bulk it's worth the time and popcorn.  Paxton and his crew have concocted an often original, deep thought inducing picture with more chills than gore, which also works for the feel. ",2002
2,"!!! Total Spoilers!!! Read for your own good!!! This review contains spoilers, and I sure as hell hope I will spoil things for anyone out there who is even contemplating viewing this piece of garbage! I have to say I was preparing to praise this movie and to give it a very high rating - until the last 10 minutes or so when the sheer nonsense the plot is based upon was finally revealed! In fact, I feel utterly insulted by how stupid the makers of this movie and particularly the one(s) who wrote the story/script expect the viewers to be! So, although I was never planning on writing reviews on IMDb, my fury at the hidden agenda this movie seems to have as well as at the fact that I will never be able to regain the one and a half hours of my life that have gone to waste simply compel me to compose this review as a warning to those who value their intelligence too much to be subjected to what I have gone through.",2010

I saw it from the middle to the end, the first time around, thought it was interesting and DVR'd it so I could watch it from the beginning. I have since watched it several times. I do not have the DVD so I have not had the opportunity to view any of the commentaries. If this has been laid out there, I am sorry to waste your time here.",2011
9,"Bill Paxton, of Aliens, Near Dark, and Terminator fame, surprises me with his debut as director for Frailty. He hits on all cylinders, but there is one implausibility near the end that involves the FBI agent (Powers Booth) which deducts a point from this otherwise chilling and thought provoking thriller. Other than that, this movie was just fine.",2006
8,"It's true that there are more than enough thrillers about serial murder - and so it's always great when a film comes along and plays with this premise - and Frailty does that brilliantly! Bill Paxton is obviously best known for his acting work (which includes film-stealing performances in films like Aliens and Near Dark), and here he gets to work both in front of and behind the camera as we get a typical Paxton-style show stealing performance, and he directs also. Obviously, this isn't a film that will break any boundaries; but Paxton takes his plot and spins an entertaining and exciting thrill-ride around it. The film opens with a man named Fenton Meiks arriving at a police station. He tells the agent in charge of the 'Gods Hand' case that he knows the identity of the killer that has been terrorising the local community. The film then moves into flashbacks, as we find out that the man's father received a vision from God, in which he was told to destroy demons. The film focuses on the father's two young boys; one of whom believes his father's visions, and one that doesn't...",2007
10,"This could be the most underrated movie of its genre. I don't remember seeing any advertisements or commercials for this one which could be the reason why it didn't do so well at the box office. However, Frailty is an excellent and a truly original horror movie. I rank it within the top 10 most favorite horror movies on my list.",2006
7,"<Spoiler Warning, don't read if you haven't seen and don't want to be spoiled>",2002
9,"A true hidden gem in the horror genre, Frailty is a slow burn movie with a strong premise and fantastic acting. It takes a pretty common motive (God made me do it) and shows the darker side of being God's right hand man. The perspective of the movie makes it look like the person who is committing murder, 'in the name of God', look like a total lunatic who is off the walls insane. And at the same time this possible 'hero' is willing to sacrifice his relationship with his son for the man upstairs. Is it worth it? That's just one of the many questions Frailty poses through its dark and tormented story. ",2015
7,"The plot starts out in a very straight-forward manner: a man with an ambition to become criminal legend kidnaps the daughter of a congressman right out from under the nose of the FBI. He then sends a note and a sneaker of the girl to Detective Alex Cross, hence forcing him out of his self-inflicted isolation, the reasons of which are explained in the opening scene. Along with the FBI agent who was in charge of security at the scene of the crime, he follows the clues laid out by the kidnapper in order to find the girl. And so the story goes. ",2002

5,ALONG CAME A SPIDER / (2001) ** (out of four),2001
7,"Crime story-wise, this was nothing extraordinary but was a pretty solid film. He isn't always like this, but Morgan Freeman does best in films where he's the likable hero-cop. He is definitely that in this film although his character, Alex Cross, is a little too sharp for believability. There were just a bit too many ""oh, come on's"" said by me watching this as Cross would get computer passwords with no trouble, etc. The odds of that happening are millions-to-one but not in the world of films. There were other examples, too, of him figuring out things that were almost impossible.",2006
5,"Along Came a Spider is not a bad movie all in all.  It is just a generic movie and a pretty decent generic movie at that.  Lets face it, every plot is based on clichés. What counts is how these clichés are used.  The screenwriter's challenge is this: Can he blow enough smoke and juggle his mirrors in such a way as to make the viewer believe he is seeing something new or, at least, enjoy the same old crap?  Shakespeare did it.  Dickens did it.  Stephen King has made a career out of it.  The problem with Along Came a Spider is that no-frills clichés are all you get, basic and unadorned. The movie's ad campaign should have featured bare white posters, a bar code and the word `Thriller' printed in the middle. Okay, I overstate.  You do get Morgan Freeman and Michael Wincott. Mr. Freeman has never given a bad performance and doesn't start with this film.  Mr. Wincott is also very, very good. He makes you feel a little sorry for his character despite his murderous escapades. You rather want to comfort him when the inevitable problems start cropping up.",2002

It leaves you on the edge of your seat throughout the course of the movie.   The only flaw that I have with the movie is the decision to use special effects in the first few minutes of the movie.  These special effects with the car were not very ""special"" at all. In fact, it was so unrealistic looking that it was borderline pathetic. Fortunately, this only occurred in this one scene.  However, the scene with the thermos (as to not give anything away) was excellent and extremely creative.  Morgan Freeman did his usual brilliant job of acting.   If you like a good suspenseful thriller/mystery, this may be a good choice for you. 8.5 Stars.",2003
6,"""Along Came a Spider"", with Freeman leading the way as a super sleuth cop who sets about to solve the kidnapping of a Senator's daughter, is strictly Hollywood formula film-making. The flick follows the rules, lacks in creativity, twists and turns a little in the middle, and provides a modicum of entertainment. With the always good Freeman and the always delicious Potter in the foreground, there's little to fault and little to rave about in this middle-of-the-road thriller.",2001
6,"This is a strictly routine kidnapping crime thriller. Morgan Freeman is the profiler/cop who delves into the criminal's mind. Monica Potter is his cop partner. It's a shame to see a marvelous actor like Freedman wasted on trite stuff like this. He has an endearingly lumpy face and a soothing voice, the kind of guy you wouldn't mind going to for reassurance when you're in doubt. He can be mighty mean too, as in ""Street Smart."" ",2002

2,"Terrible film. Laughable 'computer jargon' scattered around for no apparent reason, plus a vast number of incredibly tenuous 'clues' that are followed by the police that bear no logical connection to each other (look out for the 'picture missing on the wall' scene and try to follow the logic). Senator's daughter is seemingly a trained commando for some unfathomable reason. Female lead is so unrealistically good looking it's distracting and boring. Music is pretty bad. Best part, (the money drop), is taken from ANOTHER FILM! ",2006
4,"""Along Came a Spider"" makes use of two of the most overworked clichés of the modern crime drama. The first is the criminal who commits his crimes as a sort of intellectual exercise and then plays games with the police by deliberately leaving them clues. In reality, of course, most criminals are motivated either by greed or by strong emotions such as anger, hatred or jealousy rather than by the desire to commit the perfect crime for its own sake; Leopold and Loeb may have been exceptions, but even they were not stupid enough to taunt the police in the manner of some fictional criminals. The second cliché of which the film-makers are guilty is that of the twist, the sudden revelation of information, previously withheld from the audience, which makes them aware that the true situation is not what they had previously been led to believe. Such twists normally occur towards the end of the film, and often involve the disclosure of information about the identity or motivation of one or more of the characters.",2007
6,"Morgan Freeman is, as ever, terrific in this movie which must have looked good as a written script. However, I don't think it quite hangs together as a plot - probably because some crucial scenes probably got lost on the cutting room floor.

They discover that the crime is more complex than either of them thought.",2005
3,The ridiculous plot is so full of holes it might be mistaken for Swiss cheese. Don't waste your time or your money.

3,"...unspiced by unwise ""life-observations"" freely offered by the Alex Cross character (Freeman) to the Jezzie Flannigan character (Potter). In this way the movie is perfectly symmetrical; meaningless insights embedded in a pointless story. The plot has very few twists  if by ""twists"" we mean the head remains connected, however tenuously, to the tail. A lot of strange stuff does happen (it's just not connected to anything that went before). My suspicion is that the writer got these ""ideas"" by throwing darts against the wall - and came up with the final surprise when one bounced off the board and hit him in the head. Monica Potter is absolutely lovely to watch, and Morgan Freeman is suitably grim. My guess is that the film made money, and so for the principals, was worth the week it took to film, and the ten minutes it took to write.",2008

There are certain films for which one needs to be on a certain wavelength to enjoy, no matter how cultured or intelligent. This film is best for those who have sat around thinking about the big questions in life for long periods of time, dying for someone to talk to about them. I guess Waking Life isn't about those questions so much as it's about the people who are asking them, the wonderers, the thinkers, and especially the dreamers. For those who can appreciate it, it's a cleansing experience, one of a purity and beauty that has no equal in the films I've been fortunate enough to see.",2003

10,"Okay, i haven't read any comments yet, but a lot of the ""one line summaries"" sound negative. I just finished watching this film, and registered an account with IMDb solely to speak of this film. These are the types of movies that we should be expecting from filmmakers today. Aren't we all tired of the blockbuster bullshit by now? True, it's not a ""typical movie"" and yes...it is a cartoon. But, the style is completely unique and entirely necessary for the story. If it were simply caught on film and released in that same manor, it would not have had the monstrous effect that it had, and it would not have come across in a way that would retain the interest of this generation's ADD youth (which SHOULD be it's primary demographic...they are the ones who can still change this world, and create the paradigm shift that is necessary) This movie is the fiber of all life, it IS that collective unconscious from which we all draw our own, personal beings. It explains the philosophies of years gone by and minutes gone by in a way that anyone could understand them. While I know that some closed minded people are going to be scared and confused by all of this necessary information, if only one mind is opened because of it, I know that Richard Linklater would be greatly pleased.",2004
10,"Waking Life has broken new ground surrounding the idea of animation. Filming people, then having artists with different styles ""animate"" the recorded scenes was brilliant. The visuals are constantly changing, providing an aurora of sights that you can not take your eyes off of. Trippy? Yes, Burnt Out? No- This movie can not only be appreciated for the wild images, but for the story-line as well... On second thought-story-line might not be the right word. The actual ""plot"" of this movie can be seen as an hour and a half of the most interesting philosophy course one can find. The characters and conversations are deep, fascinating, and thought-provoking. You must see this movie more than once because it is almost impossible to absorb what you see and be able to fully appreciate the genius of the script.  I've seen it about 5 times and there are still some scenes I have yet to fully grasp. Sit back and treat your eyes and mind to the most stimulating film of the year.",2002
10,"I greatly enjoyed Waking Life, I was most impressed by the animation and the philosophical dialog that just kept hanging on the characters' every word. This movie is not for everyone, at least not for those who like their films 'light'. The fact is that Waking Life consists mostly of the main character discussing philosophical topics with various colorful characters. At some point it was difficult to remain concentrated to everything the characters say, for they were rambling quite discoursively, making the audience feel like they're attending a lecture. But the animation makes up for that, because the film has so much visual content that one could also watch it with out the dialog, just being immersed in the art.",2003
8,"It is rare for a director to return to a film and improve it but Linklater does it here. Taking the general form of Slackers, he adds a metaphysical story line and coats it with extraordinary eye candy. ",2003

1,"...who don't know anything about psychology or philosophy. Given the general lack of plot and characterizations in this movie, its ideas are all it's got. And as it turns out, its ideas are catastrophically weak and largely banal. The majority of the ideas in this movie are borderline incoherent and poorly elaborated, steeped in the intellectual waste that is post-modernism and consisting of vague and sweeping rhetoric that only simulates the act of actually thinking about anything. The few ideas that do have merit are used to draw outlandish and untenable conclusions, with only one exception in the entire movie (your job is to figure out which one). Additionally many of these are very basic and simple and could be found just by reading secondary sources on philosophy, psychology, linguistics and evolution. On top of all this, Linklater fails to provide any structure or stance for these ideas, tossing them about all haphazardly, trying to impress the viewer with the sheer volume of ostentatiously dressed but poorly thought out, banal ideas. This makes the movie come across as extraordinarily self-indulgent and mind-numbingly pretentious...which, it is. The only redeeming feature of this film is the use of rotoscoping, which is a very versatile technique and used to decent effect in this movie. Unfortunately, because the movie itself is so bad, rotoscoping is sadly reduced to a gimmick to distract viewers from thinking about how much money they just wasted to see this movie.",2008

""Talk about"" scenes are scenes in which characters ""talk about"" something without doing anything.

Tom's theory was that you should always show your audience instead of ""talking about"" what you want to show them.",2003

Both have troubled home lives and both are overly dedicated to their jobs. They bicker and they fight, but all while a real respect grows.",2007
9,"I have really enjoyed this series. I have not read any of the books so I cannot comment on how true it is to them and really do not care. As a stand alone series I love all of the characters and I especially think Nathaniel Parker is a beautiful man and he and Sharon Small have an excellent chemistry. It is a dark show and the characters are neither perfect nor brilliant and they solve crime the old fashioned way. In other words, it is very non-Hollywood. I don't know how indicative they are of how crimes are investigated in Britain but I assure you CSI isn't even remotely close to how things are done in the US. I also like that the characters are not in their 20's and are mature, seasoned people. This is the only series that I have actually purchased. I cannot praise this show enough. I did not give it 10 stars simply because I know it isn't perfect.",2008
8,"I like the stories and the contradiction in characters with Lynley and Havers. It would happen and it gives a broad view of the crimes and their details rather than having two people from the same background. They have their problems but work together well in solving the mysteries. Sharon Small is a favorite of mine anyway but I like Nathaniel a lot too. I recognize the Jensen Interceptor in the first lot but what is the red car he drives later on. The ""Helen"" character is a dead loss and superfluous in the extreme. She gets In the way and contributes zilch. I like the series a lot, the stories are complex and different. A few of the episodes are exceptional.",2015
7,"I've just finished watching the whole series over a period of a month or so. This series is hard to rate, due to inconsistency -- not the actors' fault - the writing for these series is distinctly weird. It starts off as a pretty good series, then sometime around the middle or end of S2 it becomes distinctly bad, then for s3 and maybe early s4, almost too bad to watch, then it gets tolerably good again.",2013
8,"I find this series very satisfying. It is character driven and has compelling dialog between Lynley and Sgt Havers. Havers is the real star of the show. She has very real problems in addition to working with her ponce of a boss. She lives paycheck to paycheck while caring for her parents, who suffer from dementia. How she juggles this situation with the need to be seconded to different locations to work on cases creates real angst in her character. In comparison, Lynley's problems are more social, as he frequently moralizes over dilemmas in his love life. Still, the rich detective and the hardscrabble sergeant work well with one another while solving cases that are twisty and intelligent. Like CSI, many of the cases are fashioned after recent cases in the news, so to say they are far fetched is not true. Try it out. You'll like the series.",2009
10,"Having seen the television version before reading the books, I can heartily recommend the video version over the print one. It takes liberties with stories, as any script-from-a-book would, but stays close to the characters. The chemistry between Lynley and Havers grows nicely, with a wall that will never go away that keeps any romantic entanglements out of the picture. As much as some might like to see that, it would ruin a really good friendship between unlikely people. The episodes are well shot, in beautiful locations, and constructed in a way that keeps you wondering how they're going to find their way to the end of this episode. The shame is that they were cancelled before being allowed to have one wrap-up episode. A good watch, but don't worry about reading the stories.",2008
10,"Four British detective-type series from the noughties stand out...Inspector Lynley, Rosemary and Thyme, The Last Detective, and Judge John Deed.

9,"I do admit it is not my absolute favourite of all detective shows, Inspector Morse gets that honour, but The Inspector Lynley Mysteries is a very underestimated and compelling one, made possible by the superb performances of Nathaniel Parker and Sharon Small, who play two somewhat mismatched detectives Tom Lynley and Barbara Havers. Their chemistry was very believable and grew in the show's run. All the episodes were very well shot, and the locations were beautiful. The story lines were interesting, some are slower moving than others, and there were one or two disappointing final solutions, but other than those two minor problems the stories are fine. The dialogue is well written and delivered, the banter between Lynley and Havers always working a treat, and the direction of each episode is convincing enough. Overall, a very good detective show, not the best, but the worst? No. 9/10 Bethany Cox",2010

The stories are very contrived and not particularly realistic, the pace is very slow and nothing really breaks that pace. It's exquisite boredom and the series gives itself an exaggerated air of seriousness. To me, the Lynley series, both the novels and the TV shows, are the most overrated items in crime fiction.",2008

As a matter of fact, I'm watching it right now, but I got on here and looked it up because I wanted to see what other movies the writer had written (unfortunately---it's the only one.) After looking at the ratings and comments I had to voice my own opinion.",2005
1,"The only thing more baffling than how movies this bad could ever be made is how movies this bad could go to #1 in the box office. I despair for humanity at times. The Wedding Planner features a rehashed and unoriginal plot, poor acting, no funny moments, and a ridiculous scene where Jennifer Lopez is prepared to risk getting flattened by a runaway dumpster in order to pull her shoe out of a hole in the street. riiiiiight!",2001
4,"Jennifer Lopez is right at home playing the strong, intelligent professional, Mary, and despite her inability to properly tell a joke (""What, you think Kissinger wrote his own stuff?) or properly communicate strong emotion (like despair), she does well in the cutesy moments. Matthew McConaughey is charming as the conflicted Steve, and expertly plays both his character's dry, cynical side and his boyish joyfulness. The two play against one another well, unlike the boring Fran, whose idea of the perfect wedding song is Olivia Newton-John's ""I Honestly Love You,"" and who can't seem to find one legitimate reason why she wants to marry Steve in the first place.",2013
7,The Wedding Planner tells an identifiable story about falling in love and failing to recognize it. ,2001
4,"When I got to watch this movie I thought it would really suck, but I got disappointed. This movie is by no means great, actually I think it is quite bad, BUT it has it´s qualities. The story - while not very subtle - has a few interesting points. The acting is not great, but it is not that bad, either.",2003
1,"I really do love romantic comedies, but this one was so stupid, so simple, so naive, that it made me feel sick. The chemistry between the main couple - or any of the couples - was so superficial! An other same kind of movie, My Best Friend's Wedding (Julia Roberts film), is not my favourite either, but it has at least some sense and moral. Comparing to this -- piece of junk.",2002
7,"True, ""The Wedding Planner"" does have its share of cinematic conceits.  Just watching the previews, you pretty much have a good idea what's going to happen in the end.  But unlike many romantic comedies, this is not predictable by the minute.  The characters are likable and charming, and you get quite engrossed in them.  The actors are charming as well.  Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McCoughnahey are equally good and have a fine chemistry. The scenes, in general, are handled in a sweet-natured fashion without becoming nauseatingly sentimental.  The opening scene is very original and made me laugh.  In the first scene, we get an idea of how Mary (Lopez) plans her weddings, staging them like a secret service operation, strapping wires to the bride and groom, feeding them suggestions as they walk down the aisle and making sure all the guests are in order pronto.  There are certain moments of ""sitcom stupidity.""  There's a scene where Steve (McCoughnahey) gets his hand stuck to a statue's privates.  The comedy was badly timed and the scene appeared quite lame.  A similar joke was used in Rodney Dangerfield's ""Meet Wally Sparks,"" but was done in a much more structured manner and spawned hilarious results.  About the member of the cast who I felt was a little hammy was Alex Rocco as Mary's Sicilian father.  His accent comes and goes, and in some scenes he struggles so much with it that he starts talking like someone with down syndrome.  Fred Willard has a short but funny, scene-stealing role (when hasn't Willard stolen the show?) as a ballroom dance teacher.  There are some moments in the plot that are forced and created simply to move the film along, so we can quickly arrive at the ""juicy climax.""  One of the subplots involves Mary's father trying to fix his daughter up with this silly, thick-accented Sicilian cassanova.  He wants her to get married to him, but she refuses.  Throughout the film, they don't seem to have any more than a friendly bond.  Yet later in the film, he makes a sweet proposal and Mary actually agrees to marry him.  The ending is far-fetched and over-the-top, and though I can't discuss it you've probably seen this ending before.  One thing I have to credit the writers for is refusing to make Fran (Bridgette Wilson-Sampras--Man, is she sooooo beautiful!!!) a total b**ch, like they would in most films of a similiar plot.  The way the formula goes is the guy's engaged this girl, while another girl captures his heart.  But the girl he's engaged to is usually so unlikable that you wonder why he wanted to marry her in the first place. I'm glad they didn't take that cheap route.  Even Fran has a certain charm to her character.  The charming characters and the charming actors are really what makes this movie worth seeing.  Yes, it's pretty much (though less than usual) a formula romantic comedy, but a likable one because of the way we're captured by the people on screen.  This is not a great film, it has its dull moments, it has its silly moments, but it's often a fun and pleasant movie experience.  You'll fall in love with ""The Wedding Planner.""",2001
7,"""The Wedding Planner"" is just another romantic comedy, and just another one starring Jennifer Lopez, and just another one starring Matthew McConaughey. As I have said before, Jennifer Lopez has such a beautiful feminine figure that I would prefer to see her as the romantic lead as opposed to most other Hollywood actresses working today. McConaughey is of course sexy with a laid-back charm, but that's just who he is.",2010
1,"Seriously, this movie gets about a negative 20.  Jennifer Lopez has always been a mystery to me, why does she do acting?  She's obviously awful at it. The characters are pretty flat, the story is painfully predictable and upsettingly trite.",2002
9,The Wedding Planner is the must see date movie of the year.  It's a romantic comedy with all the right elements.  But it goes above and beyond the standard chick-flick with so many lovable characters that you can't decide which one you want to win at the game of love!,2001
4,"""The Wedding Planner"" is a comedy and romance movie which has to do with a woman who is a wedding planner and she fell in love with a man who finally will be the groom of the most important wedding in her entire carrier. We watch her being in a dilemma and this has to do with what is she going to do, is she going to help the groom with his wedding or is she going to be his bride.",2014
1,"The whole plot seems forced, and things that are not funny are just crammed into this movie by the truckload. Jennifer lopez was rushing her lipstick application when she heard Matthew McConaughey's voice coming. How is that supposed to be funny ? Yet the director seems to think it's funny.",2001
1,"Three astonishingly pretty actresses in Jennifer Lopez, Bridgette Wilson and Judy Greer can't help this sugar sweet and sentimental chick-flick. The plot is to say the least thin - it is totally predictable and the story has been done a hundred times before. This movie never takes off and is dull from beginning till end. No laughs. The characters are uninteresting and you never really care about any one of them.",2001
1,"Jennifer Lopez has gotten herself into quite a quandry of sorts here. Only as of recently has her musical career exploded internationally, her focus on acting seems to be diverted elsewhere as her last few movies have been quite awful (ie. ""ANGEL EYES"", ""U-TURN""). Before her musical career took off, her movie roles were quite commendable (ie. ""OUT OF SIGHT"", ""SELENA""). For Jennifer, it is unfortunate that I feel she should have to choose between one career or the other because I don't think she can handle both. She is a great singer and she can be a great actress but it is apparent that she can't manage both at the same time. This mess of a movie is supposed to showcase her 'comedic' talents yet displays the worst side of her one-dimensional acting abilities.",2002
2,"No chemistry, no laughs, no reason to care!",2001
6,"This is a JLO romantic comedy. Make no mistake this movie defines the term ""by the numbers"". It is predictable to a tee, has the typical ""formula"" plot and sticks to it rigorously. BUT then again-if your looking for a piece of predictable fluff.... you could do worse.",2004

7,MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS,2001
5,Let's make a list of the major flaws in this movie.,2001
3,"This is one of those movies that you rent/watch for your significant other. I rented it for my wife since most of my movies as of recent have been mostly for me. However, I tried to keep an open mind and give it a fair shake. Unfortunately, this movie just fell below my already low expectations. First time director and first time screenwriters, what can you expect?",2003
9,"i found this movie very delightful and funny. Something was always going on in the movie, and i found it creative. Nothing was exactly slow in the movie. It kept going. This movie is good to watch to get a good laugh, and it teaches you a lot about finding your love. It wasn't the best movie in the world per say, because it was like a lot of romantic comedies. But seriously, all romantic comedies are exactly the same and i love them. This movie has a lot of different movie genres to it. Drama, romance, comedy, and even action. Whats there not to like? Ever since i was a little girl i loved watching this movie,and i memorized the dialog from watching it so much. I have nothing bad to say about this movie except that its common. Otherwise, it seems like a perfect stay-at-home movie to watch when trying to buy some time. ",2007
1,"Kissless wedding coordinator (into Scrabble matches and vintage movies) meets the guy of her dreams--a doctor, no less!--only to find out he's the intended groom of her latest client. Toothless romp written by Pamela Falk and Michael Ellis, neither of whom has an original thought or clever idea. The film is designed to make ladies swoon, but if they do they are easy targets. Almost completely worthless, the picture comes off looking like a Julia Roberts or Sandra Bullock reject. In the leading role, Jennifer Lopez tries but can't carry the load; she sparkles, she twinkles, but it's a fairly transparent put-on. This just about scrapes bottom. * from ****",2002
9,". . .and it's not really even about Lucia! Lucia y el Sexo is actually about Lorenzo, Lucia's novelist boyfriend, and the consequences of a sexual encounter he had in the past which has led to a catastrophic event in his life.  It's a languid and tempestuous poem of a movie, told in a non-linear way by the extremely ambitious Julio Medem. ",2002
7,"This is one of the better structured movies ever put to screen. It's as complex as Lynch's Lost Highway, but that only adds to the experience. A non-linear structure (in time and space) is applied and Lucia y el Sexo blurs the line between reality and imagination.",2005
10,"The earlier film by Julio Médem (Lovers of the Arctic Circle) is a prelude to the kind of cinematography that this Spanish film director/writer presents here.  I have read most of the other comments, but they don't do justice to it, mainly because of the lack of understanding the original tongue of this film.  The screenplay is excellent, full of metaphors and a rich use of very carefully chosen words.  People who consider this film just an excuse for depicting sex scenes as the highlight of the movie are pretty much clueless.  It is more than that, it is the complex storytelling that tangles the characters in this movie and the way that is told. Compelling and breath-taking.  A must see.",2003
8,"(8/10) Refreshing, delightful, sexy. moving and thought-provoking movie from Spain. Not really porn (as the title might suggest) although there is some very artistic explicitness. It is movies like this one that remind us that European cinema can scale the emotional dilemmas and mountains of a story where other films look at a storyline in terms of physical developments. Lucia, a young waitress in Madrid, falls completely in love with a writer. After a period of blissful togetherness, something from his past pulls him in two directions. We are caught up in his moral dilemma, of not wanting to lose the wonderful gift he has found and yet not wanting to be untrue to himself. The semi-autobiographical novel he is writing pulls together the story and the emotions and hopes of the characters and introduces ideas that enable them to heal some of their hurt.  A central idea is that of finding a hole (symbolically on the sandy beach) where, after reaching the end of the story, you can jump back into the middle. That way you can try an make things turn out better (""If you give me time"", says Lorenzo, Lucia's boyfriend.) 	A more mature and rounded work than the Director's earlier ""Lovers of the Arctic Circle"", Sex and Lucia combines wonderful acting, a great story, innovative cinema and spine-tingly beautiful photography. One of my favourite films of the year.",2002
8,"I found this film absolutely terrific. Ik know there's a lot of sex in it and yes, there are a lot of suspicious coincidences, but I looked past that.",2004
9,This is really one of the better constructed movies I've seen in a while.,2007
5,"Stories told in a so-called ""magical realism"" style like this film can be very tricky. The story and the characters need to be very strong to sustain all the twists of the plot and I don't think this was pulled off here. I was disappointed, as I'd enjoyed Medem's previous film Los Amantes del Circulo Polar, where the passionate love story seemed a lot more genuine and the tragic ending seemed to fit better with the theme of fate playing with people's lives than Lucia y el sexo's tragic-to-happy contortions. ",2004
10,"Once again Julio Meden reminds us that doing movies is an art. Not just story telling, but Art. The very way of telling the story can be artful, and this flick is a nice example. Newspaper reviews in my city gave it two stars out of four, but this guys would never give good ranking to a movie without gay action or dark, 10-ton-of-sadness endings. Great movies, artistically speaking, can be done without leaving the feel-good mood, like this one. Good acting, superb job of photography, optimistic way of portraying the human being, an excellent movie!",2002
1,"There is nothing to like about this movie. Even the much talked about sex scenes start to get boring, since they are so gratuitous and repetitive. The film is poorly scripted and none of the psychological reactions of the characters ring true. No one could take seriously the character of Lorenzo the novelist who writes such juvenile autobiographical stories. And what about the plot holes and loose ends? Why the hell does the family dog suddenly attack the young girl, with whom it had lived for years? What purpose does it serve to leave open the fate of the babysitter, her mother and Carlos (who literally disappears down a hole)? The movie tries to be deep, but fails embarrassingly.",2003
10,"SPOILER ALERT Sex and Lucia is one of those movies that will grab me and won't let go. I saw it with the fascination a child has for her bedtime tale, I connect to it with my soul and viscera. The movie speaks of an island where one can change the course of one's life, an island that floats like a raft atop the sea, that is so full of caves as to be nearly hollow, so that each of the many holes you may fall into is really a tunnel that will take you somewhere else. This is the island of Lorenzo the writer, Lucia's boyfriend.",2003
1,"Julio Medem had directed a few movies before this one, with his ""key"" movies (Vacas, Tierra, Ardilla roja, Amantes del circulo polar) being basically the same plot rehashed in a different way.  The afore-mentioned movies, in my opinion reflected limited directorial skills and zero originality.",2004
9,"Every time I watch a film by Julio Medem, the same thing happens to me, and that is that I feel weightless and it feels like time is slower and the images have a different color. With this film, it was no exception; the moment the credits appeared and I left the theater my feet felt like I was floating over the ground.",2001
6,"I can't remember seeing many movies that were more beautifully shot than this one. It doesn't hit you over the head like one of David Lean's colossal spectacular stupendous architectiptoptoloftical magnificences but it is quietly effective. Faded when it needs to be, dark and moody when required. It's not just the pretty setting. The interiors are as well done as the undulating sea grass. And the performances are equally accomplished.",2006
10,"This is the kind of movie you'll like and you'll have to see again. So smart, so amazingly entertaining, full of details you begin to realize as the end is approaching. As opposed to what some people may think, I believe that all the sex scenes, although they are pretty explicit, are totally necessary in order to tell the story and to show the characters just as they are. It's a movie to really think about and it goes from what it seems a twisted story full of rather weird elements to a (if you wanna see it in that way) sweet and simple love story. The acting was good, but mostly because there was a great book and a great direction behind it: Médem's work was remarkable. If you don't mind seeing some, you may say, awkward sex scenes, and you're looking for a really great plot, with great dialogs full of symbolisms, and also excellent photography, then you're just gonna love this one.",2005
8,"Movies like this that tread heavily into the surreal are fascinating to me. The moon (positive), the hole (negative or inverse of the moon), the man suddenly arising from the still mud (creation). I think that we can consider the movie as ""real"" or plausible if we consider that the characters arise from the writer's consciousness. ""I'm going to kill them now (babysitter and her porn-star mother)"" Lorenzo says as he arises from bed, then over to his computer where he starts writing. Why does the dog kill the little girl? Does the dog symbolize lust (note Lucia keeps saying, ""I'm dying!"" as she has sex with Lorenzo)? This is all in his head, I think, or in the computer, and finally in the manuscript displayed at the end.",2006
9,"With Lucia y el sexo Julio Medem draws on a lot of his familiar themes. Destiny,coincidence and fate alternating courses during people's lives. He also handled love and memories as important drives of people. Children tend to portray people's consciousness, with their fresh and honest innocence. As Luna's fate in this movie both infects and cleanses Salvador, taking him through his past and present.",2002
1,"This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Despite the sex and nudity the plot is ridiculous, the actors are mediocre, and the script is so bad that it verges on the involuntarily funny. ",2003
6,"There are two major problems with this movie. One is that a large amount of time is devoted to gratuitous sex scenes between Lucia and Lorenzo. Delightful as they may be, by the time Lucia is walking out on Lorenzo, there has been very little in the film to demonstrate that the bond between them is based on anything besides Lorenzo's acquiescence to Lucia's sexual aggressiveness. Lucia's initial contact with Lorenzo is the result of the fantasies she has about him based on his novel, which implies a delusional state of mind (not to mention her stalker behavior). I have nothing against on-screen sex nor against sexually aggressive women, but there was so little emotional connection between them established in the film that I had trouble buying that they had been together for six months, let alone several years. Besides, who keeps the same bad haircut for six years? Lorenzo, that's who.",2003
5,"Has anyone picked up the trend of Spanish film directors? When they don't have anything better to say, or to present anything worthwhile, they resort to showing sex, preferably, female genitalia, or even male apparatuses, to distract the naive viewer into believing they are watching something artistic.",2002
9,"""THE GUARDIAN,"" in my opinion, is a pure CBS classic! I haven't seen every episode, but I still enjoyed it. However, I think it was always touching when a mishap occurred. I always felt deeply moved. It's hard to say which episode was my favorite. It would probably have to be the pilot. Despite the fact that it was a short-lived series, it would have been nice if all the main characters had stayed with the show throughout its entire run. It seems that no one stays with a show throughout its entire run. Everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well-designed, and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, I hope they bring it back on the air for fans of the show to see.",2006
5,"I am left with much sadness after watching the entire series. Simon Baker has such a great smile, unfortunately I didn't get to see much of it here. Nick's casual drug use results in slow death for his high-profile law career as community service hours make it impossible to keep up. No human could keep up that pace. Although he is often called ""a great lawyer"" you almost never see any positive outcomes from his work at his father's firm. He is sullen, moody, non- communicative. Almost without exception his interactions are awkward. You just want to grab him and shake him up. Eventually he gets rejected by everyone. Is it his fault? In this way he is much like the rejected, abused, damaged children whom he represents in the courtroom. ",2015
8,"I know I watched this when it was on air but somehow watching it streaming as a sort of marathon makes it more powerful. Others have commented and disagreed on the acting also speculated why the show didn't last. I wanted to add my couple of cents. Simon Baker basically does play the same role in the Mentalist, (savior) but smiles and wins more hence the show not being canceled. In the Guardian, the hero does not always win, the ending is not always happy and the characters are always flawed. This might be too much for network TV. The theme song and introduction are obnoxious when compared with cable shows such as Dexter, Oz. Lulu's character is not written with as much depth as the others so its hard to fault the acting. I think the viewer felt a bit manipulated by the drawn out back and forth with Nick. Its always hard for writers to get over the hump of what to do with all that sexual tension. Just look at what happened to House. Dabney Coleman is brilliant in his intensity. This show has many shades of gray and is very much worth watching.",2011
7,"I have written here about this short-lived show in the past. Simon Baker is a perfect fit as the troubled son of a famous lawyer, played by Dabney Coleman of MARY HARTMAN fame. Because of some drug transgressions, the son, also a lawyer,must put in time at a child advocacy law firm. He also continues to work for his old man, and the two often do not see eye to eye. As time goes on in this show, things change: the father is up for a judgeship and the son starts his own law firm. Also, the son is hot for a lawyer at his father's firm, but alas, she loves another. The cases are usually intriguing, but the show is really about the father and son, and both actors pull off this thorny relationship with aplomb.There is an occasional soap opera aspect to the show, but it is kept to a minimum. Well worth watching, if a little depressing, as the son never seems to be able to stay out of trouble. It is not a lighthearted show and humor is basically nonexistent. Maybe that's why the show did not last longer than it did.",2009
10,"One of the best TV series I have ever seen. Best watched in binge mode for full appreciation of the subtle progression and change of the characters. Beautifully acted and written - like a fantastic novel you cannot put down. Really compelling because of the hugely varied types of people and characters that appear. For every beauty there is a leather-faced craggy guy, for every slick lawyer, there is a schlubby counterpart - the endless variety in the casting was fascinating, and they all threw each other into relief in such a cool way. Glad that in spite of being cancelled, it was beautifully wrapped up. Thanks, Mr. Hollander, for this great series.",2014
10,"What a great show!! Simon Baker has done an amazing job in this! I'd never get bored of watching this series! It's got everything - drama, romance, angst and much more, but the best thing about this series is the character - Nick Fallin and the superb portrayal by Simon Baker. I enjoyed watching his character grow from Season 1 - 3. Miss this series, it had a great story line. One of Simon's best performances till date :)",2017
10,"It is an excellent, excellent cast, Simon Baker is really excellent actor. I like the drama. I enjoyed every single episode, I did not see the moment to continue to the next one. It was so good and interesting. I am looking forward to more seasons. All cast is good, I am looking forward to see the other actors. I love the music, the drama was really good. Simon Baker is acting in The Mentalist which is as good as this show. It was interesting all the episodes, I did not get bored at all. I will miss the show. I hope Simon Baker do more shows as this one. His performance is excellent. Not to mention the character Lulu was excellent also as Nick. Oh and Nick's father was great.",2013
9,"The ins and out of jurisprudence, with psychologically valid portrayals of the personalities of those involved. Well produced and directed with some terrific performances.",2013
10,"I just finished watching all 67 episodes of The Guardian. I didn't know anything about the show when it aired on CBS 8 years ago, but now, thanks to Netflix, I found it. I found The Guardian to be excellent in so many ways. The writing, the acting, the stories: almost all uniformly great. As other reviewers have stated, the show was often very moving, thanks to the quality of the writing and the acting. It was believable (most of the time) without stereotypical behaviors or responses. The character portrayals were super: from Simon Baker as Nick Fallin to Dabney Coleman as Burton Fallin to Alan Rosenberg as Alvin Masterson, to name a few. The overall plot/theme of the show, with Nick Fallin as the corporate lawyer who must juggle his time between his father's wealthy law firm and Legal Services of Pittsburgh which serves the indigent, is engrossing and thought provoking. The show raises many deep issues without being (overly) clichéd. In addition, I feel that I gained insight into the legal system and what it is to be a lawyer, on both sides of the socio-economic spectrum.",2012
10,"I have never wanted to watch more than a few episodes of anything on TV-- The Guardian is my one exception...I watched all three seasons of The Guardian this summer (on Netflix). The Guardian is simply a superb show on many levels. The writing is forceful, believable, and basically brilliant. Kudos to the writers for excellent dialog and story lines! The casting and acting too was excellent...I loved each and every character. They are interesting, complex, sometimes confused, but always believable. My highest praise for the actors! I will miss them and the characters they portrayed with great skill and consistency. All the rest was great as well--including the sets, the music (perfect!)the editing, and the ending. Bravo for a fantastic show to all who were involved--I truly can't imagine a better show than The Guardian. I miss it already!",2012
9,"Anyone who is gripped by the popular crime drama, The Mentalist, and currently waiting for its next season can assuage the pain of waiting by viewing this ""old"" series of The Guardian currently showing on 5USA. It really should be picked up by the main television channels as its brief 3- season run can provide fantastic dramatic viewing over several years. The basic premise of the programme provides endless possibilities for plot twists and personal conflict and resolutions.You have the touching theme of a man defending vulnerable children's lives in court who appears to have no genuine emotion or depth himself, yet clearly does.",2011
7,RAT RACE / (2001) *** (out of four,2001
9,"From a point of view it is not convenient to give a very high mark to a movie like this, but I believe that movies have to be rated in different categories. So it could happen that such a movie receives a greater mark than a movie from a different category, which by the way has a greater artistic value. ",2006
8,"If you've seen the trailer for this movie, you're probably thinking it looks hilarious and you've made a mental note that it's one you don't want to miss.  More often than not, however, the funniest stuff is in the previews, and when you see the whole movie it's a let-down.  But I'm here to tell you, that is decidedly NOT the case with `Rat Race,' directed by Jerry Zucker, and furthermore, make a mental note:  This movie is hilarious, and one you DO NOT want to miss.  In the tradition of Stanley Kramer's 1963 BIG comedy hit, `It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World,' this one is exactly what it is supposed to be-- Fun (yes, with a capital `F'), and Funny-- with one laugh after another that just keep on a-comin'.",2002
8,"From start to finish, it's all laughs.  The movie is meant to be wacky and to be really taken seriously. I especially love the part when Jon Lovitz looks like Hitler.  It's one of the best popcorn comedies of 2001. Just sit back and have fun. B+, 8/10",2002
7,"After seeing the first trailer for this film, I thought",2002
10,"I laughed throughout this comic masterpiece and so did everyone with me, who ranged in age from 60 to 12 (I am somewhere in between).",2001
10,"I have seen Rat Race about 50 times, and it still packs the same punch for me that it did on view number 1. I absolutely love the stellar cast, which is highlighted by the performances of Rowan Atkinson, John Lovitz, and Whoopi Goldberg. Bringing many comedy stars together under one roof hasn't been done often enough. It did happen in Mars Attacks, which turned out to be a total waste of time and was and absolutely horrible movie. In this case however, the actors/actresses aren't awkwardly stuck into their roles, they all sink into very unique characters who each have a story to tell. Rat Race is a hilarious comedy that everyone should see, I have never met anyone who didn't like it. If you have nothing to do on a Saturday Night, you will enjoy this one for sure!",2005
10,"I didn't know I could laugh this often in one sitting. What a great movie. Maybe the ending wasn't the best and I don't know what Siskel and Ebert would think, but this was the funniest movie I have ever seen. You hear people talk about how funny Blazing saddles was. Well, this movie had more laughs in it than hormel has chili. I would love to know what movie packs more laughs than this. I'm sure it compares to the 1st 10 minutes of the new Austin Powers. I know it shares an actor or two. I'll let you know once I've seen them both...",2002
4,"This movie had the potential to be funny, where a group of billionaires led by a Las Vegas casino owner all made a bet to see which group of six strangers will be able to race from Vegas to Silver City, New Mexico to retrieve $2 million hidden in a locker. The first one to get there gets to keep all of the money.",2014
3,"I certainly enjoyed the original movie, but this ""remake"" just lacked everything. The plot is not the best, most characters are a very bad joke and the acting is far from splendid. The only time I could really laugh (probably because I am a history student and on top of that from Germany and therefore knew what was meant) was in the scene with the ""Barbie"" museum. I was watching this in a movie theater in Scotland and apart from me, nobody seemed to get the joke... I wonder how it was in America (or anywhere else for that matter). Apart from that, the classic is still way ahead of this. So, why even try to make a new version of a classic when you can't even get close to it?",2005
3,"I saw this movie at a .50 cent theater and it was a rip off. The one and only funny scene is of the two high school drop out teens.

3,"Rat Race is an average film at best, and unfortunately is a victim of it's own construction. Essentially a re-make of a 1963 film called ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"", it suffers from too little character development, and far too many stupid scenes that aren't very funny.",2003

8,"I always wanted to see Rat Race but I never did, don't know why, but I thought of it last night while I was renting some movies. I watched it last night and I have to say that I cannot believe that I missed out on this film! I thought that Rat Race is one of the funniest movies I have seen. As silly and outrageous as the humor is, I think that's just what I needed to put me in a good mood. The cast in Rat Race is absolutely perfect, they couldn't have picked a more comedic cast, not only that, but they all clicked so well together and made the film just an absolute blast to watch. Not to mention, cows are just getting a reputation as the perfect comedic relief, just look at not only Rat Race, but Twister, lol. The story is extremely clever, just how far most people would go to get money in their pockets.",2007
8,"I just bought the DVD today (7/3/07) 6 years after I saw it in the theater. The visit to the Barbie Museum is just as hilarious, and ""hell hath no fury like a woman scorned"" - well, you have to see Amy Smart in this role. ",2007
8,"This is a very funny film, that often had me in stitches, as it's really good fun, with a great story, and hilarious performances!. All the characters are awesome, and I think this film should be higher then 6.3 in in my opinion, plus Rowan Atkinson and Cuba Gooding Jr. are simply amazing in this!. One of the funniest moments in the film for me is when Amy Smart's character gets angry at her boyfriend for cheating on him and she goes psycho on him, and Rowan Atkinson's character was really just Mr. Bean as Enrico Pollini but he was still amazing! plus I loved the scenes him and Wayne Knight had together. The ending was just perfect in my opinion, and there are so many hilarious gags to enjoy as well, plus Seth Green and Vince Vieluf are hilarious as the two crook brothers. It's very well made and written for the most part, and if your not rolling with laughter, You'll at least be chuckling, plus John Cleese was very good in his role. I loved the scene where they search for the heart that they lost as that was very funny, plus I also loved the squirrel segment with Kathy Bates!. This is a very funny film, that often had me ins stitches, as it's really good fun, with a great story, and hilarious performances, I highly recommend this one!. The Direction is great!. Jerry Zucker does a great! job here with excellent camera work, cool angles, and just keeping the film hilarious and at a very fast pace. The Acting is lots of fun!. Breckin Meyer is fantastic in his role, he had this easygoing charm that I loved, he was also great with Amy Smart, this guy is quite underrated in my opinion, I loved him here!. Cuba Gooding Jr. is hilarious as the bone headed Ref who cost the Dallas Cowboys the game, as he did so many hilarious things, he just rocked!, especially loved the scene with him and the Lucille Ball imitators on the bus that was a scream!. Seth Green and Vince Vieluf are hilarious as the two crook brothers, and stole a lot of the scenes I loved them!. Whoopi Goldberg is OK in her role I'm not really a big fan. Lanei Chapman is good in her role I liked her. Jon Lovitz is surprisingly funny and effective in his role, because he usually annoys me. Rowan Atkinson is amazing as always and is amazing here, now he is basically just playing Mr. Bean as Enrico Pollini but it's still very funny, he brought a lot of laughs to the film!. John Cleese is good in his role just wished he had more screen time. Amy Smart is very cute and is quite funny in her role, especially loved the scene where she went psycho on her boyfriend. Wayne Knight is hilarious as usual, I loved him, he worked well with Atkinson. Kathy Bates is funny as the Squirrel lady I liked her. Rest of the cast are fine. Overall I highly recommend this one!. ***1/2 out of 5",2006
4,"'Rat Race' practically sells itself because of the number of big celebrity stars in the film. Normally films that use several big stars are not that good, and 'Rat Race' is no exception there. The film is about a group of people who are brought together to race around for money, locating different clues to lead them to the treasure. This race brings together all sorts of characters. Sure, some of the film is funny, but it's a film that once you have seen it, that is enough and the humor is quickly forgotten. Pretty much, what you see is what you get with this film. You will laugh in some places, and you will get into the action, but do not expect anything more than that.",2006
1,"How should I begin my comments on this movie, hmm.......let me think......stinks.....sucks.....awful....non-funny......how about crap! This is without a doubt the least funny, least interesting, least intelligent movie I have seen this year and maybe in the last decade. What happened to Zucker? The poor guy used to have funny movies, not this slime he offered to the public. Rowan Atkinson, can you say an Italian Mr. Bean? Wayne Knight, can you say Newman from Seinfeld? Jon Lovitz, can you say any one of his boring bits from Saturday Night Live? John Cleese, can you say the manager from Fawlty Towers? So on and so on and so on!!! Don't let me forget the leading romantic couple...its hard to believe they could be any worse than they were in ""Road Trip"", but guess what, they are in this garbage. Couldn't Zucker come up with any funny ideas? Oh wait, a cow tied to a hot air balloon....ha-ha-ha not! Wasn't funny. Wait, the dog and the heart....nope! The pierced tounge...zzzzzzzzzz! Ooooooo, I know, the Hitler car and the cigarette lighter....nada! I'm glad I checked this out from the library so luckily I didn't have to pay a rental fee. My only wish is that IMDB would allow you to give a ""0"" rating on movies, because that is the rating it deserves. Instead I gave it a ""1"". By the way, Mr. Zucker, if you are having nightmares in your sleep after making this dribble, its probably Stanley Kramer's spirit causing it. I think you owe his ghost a public apology.",2003
9,"Billy Bob Thornton has the perfect face for film noir.  His craggy, drawn features lead up to sunken but large and staring eyes, and cheeks that look to be made out of plaster.  Particularly when shot in black and white, his face becomes a landscape of shifting shadows, while he doesn't move a muscle.  He is able to give the impression of a man at war with himself even while sitting perfectly still and staring ahead.  He's Jeremy Irons, only without that unsettling accent.  The Coen brothers take great advantage of their stars' granite physiognomy throughout ""The Man That Wasn't There,"" constructing several shots around Thornton staring into a point just slightly away from the camera, impassive as an Easter Island head, moving only to smoke an ever-present cigarette while the obligatory noir voice-over narration runs.  His voice is perfect, too: a kind of calm, measured rumbling, which describes incredible events but never seems amazed by them. Thornton says ""I don't talk much,"" and it's true: he doesn't do much either, but he is still fascinating, and commands our attention.",2001

Score another one for the Coen brothers.",2001
10,"Joel and Ethan Coens' The Man Who Wasn't There doesn't (how could it) top their first film-noir classic Blood Simple, but it is still an incredibly stylish and acted with pizazz type of film which should definitely get better with multiple viewings. Billy Bob Thornton turns in another top shelve job (geniusly subtle, even for him) as a quiet and observant barber named Ed, who gets drawn into an unfortunate string of events with his wife (Frances McDormand) who has cheated on him with Big Dave (James Gandolfini who in his scattered minutes on the screen shows his ability for Oscar nomination-type work) and with the usual line of events that would come from a noir comes compelling characters and set-pieces that show's Ed in a downfall though it is from a life the never wanted to lead in the first place. If Sartre decided to throw out the politics and religion and stick to the being and nothingness and write a hard-boiled novel, this might be it.",2001
10,"What a difference a good director makes! Billy Bob Thornton, who was sadly misused in Bandits, gets to recover himself in his brilliant characterization of Ed Crane in this film directed by Joel Coen. His performance is so detailed and subtle that he uses his face to great advantage in the close-ups while the narration goes on in the background. The use of black and white heightens the atmosphere of this 40s-style film noir. The brilliant cinematography is incredible in the use of shadows and dark tones that enhances the story to such an extent. Frances McDormand is incredible in the film as well. And what could one say about James Gandolfini? He gets better and better all the time. The atmosphere of the era is captured even in the small details. It's very refreshing to see the Coen brothers get over their last disaster of ""State and Main"" with such panache, aided of course by their star, Billy Bob Thornton and the ensemble cast and a great and ironic story.",2001
10,"Besides being great stuff for film maniacs who like to debate the technical aspects, the cinematography or the artistic ideas and influences in it, 'The Man Who Wasn't There' is also a great film. One of my all-time favorites. The sort of film where the best possible choice of cast plays even the most insignificant walk-on role. The Coens' signature in there: being visually very conscious, especially for their film noir venture, they must have spent a huge amount of time to find the best possible faces for every single shot. Not necessary to waste words on how well they did in their choices for the lead roles. Fortunately these 'faces' they collected can also act, everyone does incredibly well here.",2007
8,"I haven't seen too many films by the Coen brothers(Ethan and Joel Coen)... in fact, this and Intolerable Cruelty are the only ones I've seen. I decided to see this after hearing many positive things about it, and finding out that it's a tribute to the old 'noir' films of the 40's and 50's. I love noir films, and neo-noir films are often great as well. So I decided to see this film, and I'm am very happy that I did. The plot is great... something that we all can relate to, and yet very recognizable for noir... which is quite impressive, since many noir films suffer from the plot being of limited appeal(the P.I./detective who gets *the* case, etc.). The pacing is excellent. I wasn't bored for a second. The atmosphere of the film is great... very dark and moody, even in the humor. The acting is great... Thornton, McDormand, Gandolfini, Johansson, Shalhoub... everyone is great. Billy Bob Thornton's character is easy to relate to(who hasn't felt that their life wasn't going anywhere, at one point?) and his narration as well as flawless performance is part of what makes the film noir... his character talks very little, but the voice-over and his subtle acting(which includes very little dialog) is great and he carries the movie perfectly. The characters are all well-written... there was only a short period where I didn't entirely understand a characters actions, but this was more because I hadn't thought that much about this particular character than a lack of credibility, character-wise. The story is great... it has some very interesting twists, and it holds your interest and entertains you for the entire run-time of about 1 hour and 45 minutes. The humor is good, but there is fairly little of it in the film(considering that this is what the Coen's are well-known for... well, part of it, anyway) but all of it fits perfectly. Much of it is dark, like the rest of the film. I watched this on a DVD which I borrowed from the library, and when I was about to start the film, I noticed that there were two disks... one in black/white, and one in color. I thought for a while, considered which would be better, but then I remembered that this is a homage to noir films... and, possibly more importantly, the directors intention is to make something that looks as if it could have come from that period where those films were at the peak of popularity... and why would I want to go against the directors intention on a film? That would negate the very point of watching it. All in all, if you're a fan of the Coen brothers directorial style or neo-noir/film noir, you'll most likely love it as much as I did. If not, maybe you can just enjoy the great acting and atmosphere. And if not that, the film probably just isn't for you. I recommend it to any fan of the Coen brothers and of film noir/neo-noir. Fans of any of the actors might also like it. Just be prepared; it is quite dark, and many will not like it simply for that. If you believe you can sit through this film, you definitely should consider it. 8/10",2004
9,"I'm sorry, but I like my black and white black and white - ESPECIALLY in a film that sets out to be the most pure film noir of all.  The shadows should be, simply, black, not black tinted with dark green.  The greys should be, simply, grey, not pearl grey or slate grey or any of the other shades of paint-catalogue grey that are the result (I presume) of trying to make a black and white film without using any actual black and white film.  I don't know the precise technological explanation; I do know that the film would be at least twice as good if the Coens would simply take the master print and transfer it to whatever material they use when they screen, say, ""Double Indemnity"".  This is not hyperbole.",2002

Its story about a man who makes an error of judgement that sends his life into a downward spiral will, of course, be familiar to noir fans but in this case, the adverse consequences are so far-reaching that they also go on to devastate the lives of a number of other key characters as well.",2015

1,"The closer you look, the less you know. This is the favorite parable of the nihilist attorney, Freddy Riedenschneider, in The Man Who Wasn't There. It almost doubles as the theme; you just have to tweak the last part. The closer you look, the less there is. The Coen Brothers' latest offering plays like a David Lynch piece that never made it off the shelf. At face value is a film with some of the most talented actors around today, with the smallest yet most dynamic role going to James Gandolfini. Upon closer inspection, however, is a film that isn't there. It is tediously long, bogged down in narration, has no redeeming characters, and fumbles through excessive, uninteresting subplots. It is as if there were four different editors, all in conflict about where and when to end the movie. Billy Bob Thornton's main character has all the enthusiasm of a dying Eeyore. Something seemingly haunts his character but we never find out his interests in life or anything about his past and, thus, have little interest in his future. So he falls into some extreme bad luck and is finally convicted and killed, not to mention everyone else. His bad luck is over the top, however, and we, as an audience, cannot relate to it in a context other than a weird Coen Brothers film. Further, we have little sympathy for him when he dies because he was never alive. The other characters, which are virtually all killed off, have the same lack of a lust for life. Why Thornton's character is the main focus remains a mystery, because he is actually the most boring of them all. You can always count on great, quirky performances in a Coen Brothers movie, but unfortunately there is little more than confusion and uninspired surrealism beneath the black and white surface of this one.",2001
10,"The Coen Brothers are arguably the best film makers working today and this film proves it once again. Shot in black & white the film follows seamlessly in the tradition of the classic film noirs that came before it and adds its own Coensian twist. The performances are top notch with a stand out by lead Billy Bob Thorton. The movie should have been nominated for Best Picture! What's wrong with these Academy Members anyway???? Instead A Beautiful Mind (HUGELY overrated) grabbed its spot. As for the noms for Best Actor in a lead role that year, overrated performances by Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe robbed Thorton of his nomination. The Man Who Wasn't There is stylish and beautifully paced, wrapping it's timing around a bit of classical music from Bethoven that's played throughout the movie. Also a nice chance to see an early performance by up and coming Scarlett Johansson in a small but important part. Could quite possibly top my list of favorite Coen Brothers Movies.",2004
7,"Man Who Wasn't There is lost out of the gate. It's much clearer the second time you view it. It flits between 10 different incompatible story lines, and can't figure out a way to develop any of them. It goes nowhere. Many viewers were tricked into thinking this movie matters due to its cinematography (It looks nice) and by the authors (The Coens continue to receive unearned accolades). It's a bunch of Noir posturing/noodling with scenes designed to kill time, not add up. It drifts and drifts and drifts. It's a catalog of half-hearted, half-developed ideas, so it begins to feel like it's running long after only 20 minutes. Who can tell what they set out to explore? A viewer will never figure out why it was brought into existence because the Coens have not imbued it with any sense of purpose. Long before Burn After Reading, and O Brother, the Coens were making movies that lacked a reason for being.",2011
7,"The 2002 Cohen brothers film is a delight. ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" combines everything I like in the Coen brother's unique way of telling a story. From the comic of the situation witnessed in the famous ""O Brother Where Art Though"" (2000) to the originality of the scenario seen in ""Barton Fink"" (1991), not to mention the singularity of the characters and their lack of control over the situation in the excellent ""Fargo"" (1996), all those ""hints"" have been gathered to built this well thought story. Joel and Ethan directed and wrote this picture about a bored and boring chain-smoking barber admirably played by Billy Bob Thornton (best role for this under-rated actor)who blackmails his wife's boss and lover for money to invest in dry cleaning. As you sense the plan goes terribly wrong. I believe this story is a pretext to show us how little is our grip on the reality of our lives. And to demonstrate how justice easily becomes a comico-pathetic masquarade when given by men. On the contrary true Justice eventually lies in the wrinkles of men's destiny. As a conclusion you are better off expecting a landing of an alien spaceship than a fair and clear trial in a court of law. Whether we agree or not to this demonstration, it does not take away the pleasure of watching these terrific actors putting into play the original and dark scenario of the two brothers. Billy Bob Thornton is a master portraying to perfection Ed Crane (the laconic barber). Since Dead Man (1995) I don't recall a lot of movies where directors have capitalized on his enormous talent. Frances McDormand (Doris Crane) is as usual fantastic. We remember her in Wonder Boys (2000) and of course as the sheriff in Fargo (1996). Here she plays wonderfully the barber's wife going from bitterness to sorrow. Some characters can be seen as ""cliche"" like Freddy Riedenschneider the lawyer played by the good Tony Shalhoub, however they are all enjoyable to watch: James Gandolfini is terrific as ""Big Dave"" and Jon Polito very colorful as Creighton Tolliver, not to forget the very talkative and sincere Michael Badalucco as Franck Raffo or the great job done by Scarlett Johansson in the role of Rachael 'Birdy' Abundas the not very straight and quiet adolescent you would expect. The Black and White picture is more an artistic exploration from the Coen brothers and I don't think has anything to do with the chosen period (late 40's). However the black and white picture is very well shot by Roger Deakins and impose tremendously well Billy Bob Thornton's character and therefore never becomes a burden for the audience. ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" does not belong to any genre in particular. The Movie is made of a myriads of genres and characters that the Coen brothers have managed to master throughout their career of story tellers. The movie is a ""film Noir"" but not only, it is a dark comedy but not only, it is a light thriller but not only, it is shot in black and white but still have colorful characters, it tells a simple story of a laconic barber but there is more to it, eventually Justice will prevail but not the way we think it will. In the end it is a unique movie and in times where everything seems to look the same this movie becomes a true jewel.",2002
2,"I saw this film on 10/15/01 at the Denver International Film Festivale and found to be very dissapointing. I'm still trying to understand why the Coen Brothers let me down. The characters were flat, the plot was dull and if this was an ode to Film Noir the Coen Brothers didn't do a very good job. Several people who left the screening behind me commeted the same way. I almost fell asleep in the middle of this mess. The Coen Brothers best films were: ""O Brother Where Art Thou"", Blood Simple"" ""Fargo"" and ""The Hudsucker Proxy"". I was all hyped to see there new film in advance and what I came away with was a headache, James Gandofini didn't make his character worthwhile and France McDormand seemed to sleep walk through her role along with Billy Bob Thorton at her side sleep walking too. Billy Bob seemed bored and his line reading reading came aross like cardboard, very flat and lifeless. It seemed Billy Bob was trying to be redo his Sling Blade role the way he walked and talked. A very Zzzzzzzzz movie. Very forgettable. No Oscars in sight for this film or its actors, mabey some more ating classes and that is about all.",2001

Only two of their films, in my opinion, achieve anything more, Barton Fink and Fargo, but even they only walk a few steps past that line.",2002

I really like the kids and think Keanu Reeves plays it straight with them.  New York Times and local reviewers aside--way aside, this movie is definitely worth a look.  I spent eight years on Chicago's South Side, and i'm grateful a cinema team is willing to show some emotion about some of the stuff that is part of grim daily life.  The plot formula is good:  i don't like cold voyeuristic slice-of-life with this material.  I like that the material is used with an up-beat ending.

From the coach struggling with his own morality, vices and (of course) romance, to the kids plagued by the daily atrocities of their neighborhood.

With out flinching an iota in portraying the material decay and the real fear of violence that permeates its setting, the film still shows the beauty of life--the importance of ""just showing up"" and trying. The young, unknown boys give outstanding performances which are matched by a moving performance by Keanu Reeves. Reeves, in his most emotive performance to-date, plays the team's coach who is redeemed by his contact with the kids, by simply learning to care about someone besides himself.

It's very well made and written and it has a very emotional scene near the end involving the character G-Baby, plus The baseball action is actually not too bad. Diane Lane was really good as usual, but I wish they gave her more screen time and more to do, and I liked the ending, plus Keanu and Lane had pretty good chemistry together. Keanu had a pretty cool emotional speech, and I feel this film is underrated, plus it took me a while to warm up to Reeve's character at 1st because he was rather unlikable at the start, and an obsessive gambler. Keanu had a great relationship with the kids, and while I wish they would have shown us the final game, The ending they chose fit the film well, plus there were some pretty nifty defensive plays as well. This is great fun for the whole family, that may be Baseball's version of the Mighty Ducks, with a really good story and excellent performances, I highly recommend this one!. The Direction is great!. Brian Robbins does a great! job here with very good camera work and keeping the film at a fast pace. The Acting is excellent. Keanu Reeves is amazing as always and is amazing here, he is rather unlikable at 1st, but then grows on you, he also had pretty good chemistry with Lane, gives one of his best performances, as always had charisma, and you will begin to feel sorry for his gambling addiction after a while. (Reeves Rules!!!!!!!). Diane Lane is incredibly gorgeous, and is amazing with what she had to do, just her screen presence and beauty is enough alone for me, she had pretty good chemistry with Reeves, I just wish they gave her a bigger part and more to do (Lane Rules!!!!!!!). John Hawkes is amusing as the weasel I dug him. All the kids do surprisingly well and were very likable. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall I highly recommend this one!. ***1/2 out of 5",2006

I like some of the work that Keanu has done but I can't say that I liked all of it.  Hardball was a pleasant surprise.  The boys made me laugh, the story made me want to cry and at one point I did.  I really do think that Keanu surprised me and made me reconsider my views on his abilities.  Given the right material and good Direction, the man can act.  One scene literally brought my friends and I to tears.  I would recommend this movie to just about anyone.",2002
7,"I didn't really want to see Hardball, I went in with low expectations. So I was almost surprised when staring at the 'rate this movie' screen I gave it 7/10, but let me tell you why (and trust me I thought about it for a few long moments deciding what to give it and why). First the downside: the story was predictable in every way, it was almost painful for me to see children so young using such language and being abused in so many ways, but it was realistic. The high rating I gave it was because the young actors were so very talented, and while the story was obvious it still managed to make me care what happened and what was happening. I wasn't engrossed, I didn't sob like a baby, I didn't find it a revelation on life and death. However, it was very much what it purported to be, a story about showing up. And it did have an interesting message about how something, that to one person can be so insignificant, can be so profound and life-changing to others. Keanu Reeves gets a lot of bad press about being a 'bad actor' but I found him very believable and thought he did an extremely good job. He has a lot of charisma and an amazing ability to make you care about his characters, and want, in the end, the best for them.",2001
4,The director should be ashamed of this movie.  I hope the screen writer used an alias.  This movie was stuck together with sticky notes.  The director could not even get the day and night sequences to make sense.  I noted this movie is getting an average rating of 7.0.  Just goes to show how desperate the movie going public is for a good movie.,2001
4,"Imagine what Hollywood would make if it combined ""The Bad News Bears"" with ""Boyz N the Hood?"" Or ""The Mighty Ducks"" got tight with ""Dangerous Minds?"" ""Varsity Blues"" director Brian Robbins and ""Summer Catch"" scenarist John Gatins cover ""Hardball"" with so much sap they should have called it ""Spitball."" This hopelessly derivative and shamelessly schmaltzy sporting fable offers little that hasn't been done better before, aside from its star appearing in such a movie. Hollywood spouts ideological gobbledygook through both dialogue and actions. ""Hardball"" rolls back time to the 'white man's burden' problem dramas. I haven't seen anything in the press about Spike Lee's reaction to ""Hardball,"" but I'm dying to know about his complaints. ""Hardball"" dodges the question why whites are coaching blacks in modern-day American team sports. Is this commentary about the paucity of black role models in contemporary America? ""Hardball"" mirrors the 1965 Moynihan report. Assistant Secretary of Labor Daniel Patrick Moynihan argued racism prevented African-American men in the ghettos from obtaining good paying jobs. Humiliated because they could not support their families, these men without self-esteem abandoned their role as husbands and/or fathers and fled, leaving their wives an awful burden. ""Hardball"" projects this image of African-Americans in Chicago's real-life Cabrini Green, more of a war-zone itself than a housing project. Lacking black father role-models for themselves, a team of foul-mouthed fifth graders bond with an amoral, compulsive gambler who smokes like a chimney, guzzles like a fish, and frequents sports bars. Baseball redeems oddballs in this bummer of a hardboiled sandlot saga. Reportedly, Paramount Pictures slashed the controversial R-rated version of this rough-hewn opus and wound up with a strongly-worded PG-13 rating. Nevertheless, Gatins' heavy-handed, tear jerking morality tale still comes out swinging.",2008
4,"At first, I expected this to be another Mighty Ducks-type of movie, with heartwarming interaction between a messed-up guy and a lovable group of kids who teach him about teamwork and the love of the game.  But no.  In Hardball, Keanu Reeves started out grumpy, and he stayed grumpy.  The kids, despite the trauma in their lives that could be pretty sympathetic, weren't lovable, and you didn't feel like you got to know them on any kind of personal level.  If Keanu's character had grown, if his coaching had seemed to mean anything to the kids or if you could in any way understand Diane Lane's contention that the kids trusted him and they're never wrong, then this movie might have been okay.  As it is, however the story was bad, and the weak acting only added to that to make this movie less than enjoyable.",2004

7,"A movie that proves that what you see is not necessarily what you get, as a mother/daughter team con one well-heeled member of the opposite sex after another, in `Heartbreakers,' directed by David Mirkin and starring Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt.  Yes, the con is on, as mom takes em to the altar, daughter seduces em (getting caught in the act by mom, of course), and mom settles for a divorce and some big bucks.  For the women, it's like having the goose that laid the golden egg, and all is going well; the bucks are rolling in and Cupid's path is being littered in their wake with the carnage of the men they've despoiled.  Then Page (Hewitt), much to the chagrin of her mother, Angela (Weaver), decides it's time to strike out on her own and take down a score for herself.  But as fate, luck, chance or what-have-you would have it, at that moment the IRA steps in and not only wipes out their bank account, but hands them a bill for back taxes that far and away exceeds the amount already confiscated.  At that point, what's a girl to do, but find another mark.  Only this time, it has to be one rich beyond their wildest dreams.  And with that, the hunt is on.",2001

Maxine (Sigourney Weaver) and Paige (Jennifer Love Hewitt) are two very slick con artists who find rich patsies and marry them, only to divorce them for big settlements after enticing them into indiscretions.  When they get nabbed by the IRS for not paying their taxes, they must score one more time to climb out of their financial mess.  The target is chain smoking billionaire William B. Tensy (Gene Hackman) who is dying before our eyes of lung disease.  The only question is whether Maxine can get him to propose before he keels over.

10,"What a fabulously funny film!!!! Jennifer love Hewitt and Sigourney Weaver work so well together, and the emotional scenes in the film are so believable. Plus looking at Jennifer love Hewitt in a series of brightly coloured micro dresses is fabulous. You can really tell she is turning from a little bitch to a sensual beauty who cares. Sigourney Weaver is so funny, I was in stitches listening to her as ""olga"". What I did find confusing though was her constant hair colour and length change. One minute its long and red, the next like a bob and blonde, was it a wig, if so where was the indication!!!! Her rendition of ""back in the U.S.S.R"" was hilarious yet catchy. Ray Liotta, Gene Hackman and Jason Lee as the love-struck victims are perfectly cast.In the scene where Jennifer Love Hewitt is on the bed ""sleeping"", and opens her eyes crying, I was and still am choked when I see it.

Heartbreakers is a delightful comedy that proves how deceitful a clever woman can be,as Weaver demonstrates as the gorgeous and alluring Max Conners,who targets wealthy gentleman,walks them down the aisle,and then empties their pockets through divorce when she discovers that they have eyes for other women.But the amusing thing about this film is that the other women is Max's sexy younger daughter Page,and she can turn just as many heads as her mother.Unknown to her husbands,Page is trained to seduce them,helping her mother get out of her newest marriage with a few bucks in her pocket,and the freedom to put more foolish men under her spell.Ray Liotta is hilarious as Dean,and Vinnie Stagliano,the ex husband of Max,who is bitter and desperate for revenge when he discovers how much of a bitch his ex wife is.Meanwhile,Page believes she could just as easily lure men into marriage like her mother,and sets her sights on Jack Withroe (Jason Lee)a bar owner who falls in love with her,unaware of her game.But the plot really gets interesting when we learn that Page has a heart and is in love with Jack.The ending is exciting,enjoyable and romantic.Heartbreakers is a fun film for the females,with plenty of eye candy and cleavage for the males!",2005

Not just hot, but smoking hot. I mean hot enough for you to cry in pain at how unfair life is hot. So hot she might as well have wore a nun costume in ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer"" because she was never as hot as this.

10,"I can't believe some of the nonsense I've read here. People are complaining that Redford looked too old in the flashback scenes -- for one, I thought he looked believable. Secondly, Hollywood hasn't cloned Redford in a vat yet so we'll just have to live with scenes like this. So get over it. Others complain that the movie is somehow BORING, which blows my mind, considering it's non-stop, fast paced action and dialogue. If you're attention span is too short for this movie I'm sure you'll enjoy crap like ""XXX"". Others complain about messy plot logic (how did a CIA operative get into a Chinese prison? Huuu duhh, I dunno! It's a popcorn flick you morons! It's not a 900 page novel or a documentary). The plot takes a few leaps here and there, but a Snake Eyes or Face/Off this film is not. I read complaints about the 'arty', flashy 'MTV' style editing and filming techniques -- I actually thought the movie was filmed and edited superbly and the contemporary, TV-commercial style actually complemented the film. It's crisp, tight, taut and entertaining. You get the feeling this is a high-quality production, whereas with something like ""Mission Impossible 2"" the same type of style is implemented but it comes off feeling cheap. Not here, not with this movie. As with Enemy of the State, it works. I have a feeling some of the people that thought it was boring simply couldn't follow what was going on. The plot does make sense if you have the attention span to keep up.",2002
8,"Spy Game is everything we're not supposed to expect from a major Hollywood movie: engrossing, intelligent, well written, acted and directed.  But that's just what it is and more, this is definitely the best thing I've seen since Memento.  Although Pitt is really good and Redford plays himself as well as he has in years, I think the most credit should go to Tony Scott. In the hands of a lesser director this could have been something more like Mission Impossible.  But Scott stays right on target, keeping us interested, developing the characters, and keeping the pacing nearly perfect.  Scott also shows us that he's stayed with the times: he employs the full array of modern camera tricks like fast motion, reverse zooms and funky lenses but in a way that actually makes the film better instead of being an annoying distraction.  The dialogue feels natural, all the actors do good work, no one tries to steal the show or be the star.  The story is interesting and almost never lapses into the kind of hyper violence or sappy sentimentality one has come to associate with modern studio pictures.  You get a feeling this is pretty close to how the CIA really operates, a place with fantastic technology at its disposal but who's ultimate effectiveness is determined by the fallible people who run the missions and take the chances.  I really enjoyed this film, I hope it's a sign of things to come and not a rarity.",2001
9,"There are many reasons why we like a movie or not. For me, this is the case in witch small things were enough to like it: the two main actors, the places in which the action occurs, and the fact that it has more to do with a love affair, in a tragic atmosphere than about spies. Well, of course this is about spies - two of them - and mostly about the relation between them; if they are similar enough to understand each other, they are also different enough to generate some tension in the relation.

It's an underrated, taut masterpiece that gets everthing right -- the writing, directing, editing, acting is all Oscar caliber. Not to mention it's one hell of an ambitious production. Spy Game is what happens when professionals in the business come together to make an intelligent, masterfully crafted thinking man's actioner that as a viewer you can have complete confidence in while viewing -- that's a rare thing these days in Hollywood. It's a rare gem that reminded me of Clear and Present Danger.

So the story is told by Redford as a narrative. He narrates how they came together, carried out missions together and ultimately parted their ways.

9,"This is what an intelligent and entertaining Spy movie should look like. And I don't mean the ""Super-Spy"" genre with its gadgets and sly wit. In contrary. This is a very clever plot using many time and space spanning scenes. In short it revolves around a young CIA agent (Pitt) who tries to rescue his one time asset and then beloved (McCormack) from a Chinese prison. He gets captured and will be executed a few days later. 24 hours before the execution the CIA learns from his capture and, a presidential visit and trade talks ahead, decide to burn the rogue agent. They contact his recruiter and mentor (Redford) to fill them in on the young agent. This he does. Between these flashback scenes the senior agent uses all his wile he gained as a field agent to set his protegé free. The plot twists several times in unexpected ways and the tricks Redford uses in his scheme are simply great. The fine scene from ""Clear and present danger"", where Ford tries to outsmart his fellow deputy director are but a mere faded memory from this scheming. The directing utilizes modern fast paced cutting and editing, but mostly in scenes where there is action. Unlike many other movies using these methods, here it enhances the film instead ruining it (I regret watching the otherwise great movie ""Man under Fire""). Speaking of action, if you expect an action packed spy movie like the fore-mentioned ""Clear and present danger"", you'll be disappointed. The only shooting involves a bunch of soldiers (first Vietcong, later on US Marines) and is only mere background. Most of the suspense is created verbally and the movie is filled to the brim with adrenaline rising suspense. The acting is very strong, especially Redford and Pitt, which seem to have developed a great chemistry. Having worked together before may have helped. But Redford definitely dominates the movie. His scenes are more than intense and when he unpacks his most dangerous weapon, his smile (in the scene when the nasty superior thinks he has nailed Redford) it is most memorable. I think this is one of his strongest acting. Summary: If you read and like intelligent thrillers from authors like Forbes, Le Carré or Nichols you might already have devoured this gem of a movie and if not, go and get it.",2008

He does an excellent job of appearing normal and not star struck. Robert Redford is excellent in his ability to draw you into his character and wonder what he is thinking throughout the movie. Redford is even better at appearing smart and witty than he was in 3 Days of The Condor.

The acting was great by Mark Wahlberg.  Jennifer Aniston  had a great supporting role, and looked lovely as ever.  What made this movie for me was the music.  If you do not like 80's glam metal or hair bands, then you probably wont like this movie.  Its all about being a rockstar.  Some cliche's were present, but didn't bring down the movie at all.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes rock and roll and remember to Stand up and Shout!!! 8 of 10 for great acting and awesome music.",2001
6,"As a huge fan of 80s Hard Rock, I was really looking forward to seeing Rock Star. As the movie started I was more than satisfied. A lot of the early scenes were funny and entertaining. The concert scenes made me feel like I was actually there. One major compliment I give this movie is that they made the songs from the fictional band STEEL DRAGON sound realistic for the time period the movie is in. If I didn't know better, I could've been fooled into thinking Steel Dragon was a real band, and all their songs actually were made in the mid 80s. The underdog portion of the story may not be original, but it still works none the less. And by the time Wahlberg's character was in his first concert with the band, I really thought Rock Star could be one of the coolest movies of the year.",2001
7,"Surprisingly well-acted, well-written movie about hard rockin'-but-decent young man getting that much-hoped-for ticket to stardom: his favorite heavy metal band wants him to replace their lead singer. Not far-fetched, the film tries keeping things in perspective and doesn't go over-the-top; it certainly makes you think twice about those lingering adolescent fantasies about being in the music business. But the script, despite solid dialogue, follows a tried-and-true, formulaic pattern, and gets bogged down by its own clichés in the final act. I enjoyed it much more than the sugary fluffball ""Almost Famous"". It has a nice, bitter edge to go with its heavy metal decadence, but a stronger finish might've made it more memorable. **1/2 from ****",2002

When the opportunity comes for him to take over his ""idol's"" role in the band, he jumps at the opportunity.  However the role of a rock star may not be what it is cracked up to be... and relationships can change ....  This movie certainly struck me as having the theme of what you attain for may not be what you think it is once you get it.  Overall a really good movie with great performances from all the cast as well as the two leads, Mark Walhberg and Jennifer Aniston.  It did make me feel sad, especially when Emily, (Jennifer Aniston), met up with Chris in Seattle and saw the depths to what he had sunk.  If anybody ever dreamed of being a rock star or a groupie they should watch this movie to see that the lifestyle, although glamourous for a while, is very lonely and ultimately not what you may want.",2001

It is also a movie I, as a MAJOR Hard Rock fan enjoyed-no-loved actually-while all the while being very consciously aware of its many flaws and that the movie, while a decent effort in some respects missed the chance it had to escape into greatness and become a rock movie classic. Oh well....",2004

8,WARNING - POSSIBLE SPOILERS!,2004
1,"This is the movie that is somewhat based on the exit of Rob Halford from British Metal Gods 'Judas Priest' and how the band replaced him with Ripper Owens, who used to front a Priest tribute band. Originally titled Metal God this movie could have been something great. Instead, someone in an office somewhere who knows little to nothing about metal music decided to water it down. From the title change of Metal God to the 'safe' middle of the road 'Rock Star' to the lame soundtrack this movie plays out badly. Having spent most of my life in a professional metal band I was really looking forward to seeing this, I was very let down by several points of the film. The soundtrack is very NOT metal for one, and the ending of the movie is lame as well. The movie does have a few bright spots in the writing and acting but as a whole, it fails in the end because...1)A movie based on a metal band should have a metal soundtrack. 2)There is NOTHING metal about Marky Mark or Jennifer Aniston. If Bon Jovi, Warrant, Def Leppard and Poison are your idea of 'heavy metal' go see this movie. If Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Dio & Black Sabbath are your idea of metal see this movie for a good laugh.",2002
2,"No emotion. Bad music (and I am a reformed eighties metal guy, so I would be vulnerable to some good stuff.) Everything is half done. The brother is a parody, there is nothing to hold us in except to see what horror from the eighties they'll pull up next. The tour manager tries to bring a humanity to the thing but isn't given enough time. Wahlberg is okay and Aniston is slumming. We know she didn't need the money. Is this the only role she could fit into her summer break? Surely she must slap her forehead every time it pops up on VH1--which is only slightly less often than Ozzy does. It barely qualifies as a TV movie. It's just hard to believe that it was actually released theatrically.",2006

7,"2001's ""Rock Star"" is loosely based on the metal band Judas Priest, who hired the lead singer of an Ohio JP tribute band, Tim ""Ripper"" Owens, after losing their original singer, Rob Halford, aka 'the metal god' (taken from the Priest song ""Metal Gods""), which explains why the movie was originally to be called ""The Metal God"". All the major plot points of this film parallel the Judas Priest story; only the names and times have been altered.",2014
6,"A simple film that plugs in a talented singer for a cover band dreaming to become a genuine 80's rock star. Chris (later to be known as Izzy), is looked upon as a strong leader of his cover band but eventually his obsession with Steel Dragon (his favorite band)and unwillingness to alter the bands sound creates waves of dissatisfaction to his fellow band mates. After a confrontation over the seriousness and intention of playing cover songs, Chris was thought to be misdirected and was eventually kicked out of his own band. Things change, however, after two girls who make themselves out to be groupies, showed front man and lead guitarist Kurt Cunning his video performance. He auditions, he gets in and the rest is pretty simple.",2011

Myles Kennedy-Thor-(Real singer for Alter Bridge)Great Singer.Also Michael Matijevic does a lot of the singing along with Jeff Scott Soto.I like the movie mostly because of the story.A Guy just off the Street gets to sing & be part of a great band.I'm not giving anything away but everything is not what it seems.Give the movie a try you won't be disappointed.,2010
8,"I think people have been a little to harsh on this movie. No it is not revelatory but it is a nice glossy diversion. The all-star cast, especially Hugh Jackman, is more than competent though they aren't really challenged. There are enough special effects and stunts intermixed with a fairly compelling narrative (it is not confusing if you just pay attention) to make the film more than worthwhile. Overall good entertainment, 7/10.",2003
6,"Action... explosive action. Clever script. Eye popping special effects. A strong cast, but too much confusion in following the story line. A highly successful computer hacker(Hugh Jackman)is coerced to help a ruthless spy(John Travolta)steal billions of unused government monies obtained in an old DEA drug operation. Don Cheadle is the run ragged FBI agent trying to spoil the by-computer hijacking. Sam Shepard has a small role as a corrupt Senator. The alluring Halle Berry is supposedly an undercover DEA agent whose purpose in the whole procedure is not clear cut.",2002

9,"Swordfish was one of my anxiously awaited summer flicks.  And after seeing it a couple hours ago, I am not at all disappointed.  It's been awhile since I've seen a truly enjoyable, mature action movie.  With the slew of PG-13 action movies of recent years, it's refreshing to see one that at least acknowledges that many intense situations do involve language, sex, and mixed character reactions - it wasn't just another black and white, good and bad movie where the good guy does only good things and the bad guy has only evil intentions.  The good guy (Jackman) didn't always do the right thing, and the bad guy (Travolta) could hardly be accused of sinister motives.",2001
6,"Here's a film I really liked the first time, and was totally turned off on the second viewing as the Hollywood bias machine was in high gear again, and you can guess in what director (left or right). Anyway, two things remained the same: John Travolta as ""Gabriel Shear"" was riveting as an anti-terrorist terrorist. The explosion scene where people are flying sideways is awesome, particularly in the sound department if you have surround system. Oh, and yes, Halle Berry and her figure was on display in this film and quite a sight. Wowzer!",2006
1,"It's ironic that Travolta wastes the first 3 minutes talking about the ""problem with Hollywood"", and then the movie uses the next 2 hours to evidence the problems in detail. Why can't film-makers actually use input from computer and security experts to improve their scripts? How hard would it be to have the computer-related bits make sense?",2007
1,"SPOILER WARNING : this movie has the most repulsive morality I have seen in a LONG time. We are supposed to root for a heroic villain with despicable methods (slaughtering innocent bystanders) just to keep the American way of life safe, no matter what the cost. The fact that all these innocents are considered as pawns by the filmmakers, not even given a shred of individuality or humanity, just shows how utterly immoral and dishonest the whole enterprise is. If this is what the action movie has stooped to, then maybe the whole genre should be put in the cooler for a few years. And the writer obviously never heard of the saying 'patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel'. Instead, in the world of Swordfish Might Makes Right, and any terrorist attacks on Americans are 'rightly' avenged on an innocent civilian population. Apart from this moral point of view which will play really badly outside of the US (but then, who cares about the population of 5 other continents, right?), the movie as a whole is disappointing. The plot never makes much sense, the emotional aspects of the story are forgotten quickly and clumsily developed. Hugh Jackman should go very far, he is reminiscent of the younger Mel Gibson and a magnetic screen personality. Unfortunately, the character is so underwritten that he spends the last 40 minutes scowling desperately, rather than being allowed to actually act. Add some excessive CGI which diminishes rather than enhances the spectacle, some really bad one-liners and an unfortunate penchant for ridiculous sub-Tarantino monologues about movies (geek country - would any rogue superspy REALLY spend his time thinking about the difference between Hollywood movies and real life? Of course not. But slacker video clerks would), and you are left with a subpar action movie which leaves a truly foul taste in the mouth. Any good points? Well, Jackman, of course, and the sight of a bus being hauled over the LA skyline by a helicopter. But apart from that, a total waste of time, money and (some) talent.",2001

1,"There is not one redeemable quality about this movie.  It was sheer torture to watch, as the characters undergo sheer torture at various points.  Too much senseless violence, too much ridiculous chase material (e.g. the main characters somehow remain standing though all others are burned, exploded or shot), and a difficult to follow plot.",2001
4,-SPOILERS-,2004
1,"In the opening sequence of the movie, John Travolta laments the lack of realism in the Hollywood movie industry. As this over the top movie races through its seemingly endless scenes of gratuitous violence, overkill and overacting, I could only wonder at the illogical hypocrisy of this argument.",2001
1,"I've read several of the reviews listed in here and I am amazed at how many people are receptive to this movie.  Is good storytelling not important anymore?  When should an audience have to fill in all of the holes by conjecture, based on their own opinions, not what the film showed them?   The filmmakers claim to have created complicated characters...who is good and who is bad...but the film was so poorly written that I doubt that the actors even knew what their character's motivations were.  That is except for the Hugh Jackson character, whose motives were so blatantly obvious (getting his daughter back).  If the screenwriter had written one more dialogue scene stating that fact, I would have screamed!!  We know, we know!  He loves her,  he loves her!  He wants her back!!  Just don't say it again, please!!!",2001
1,"Even the outstanding cast couldn't help this movie.  Weak plot and way too much senseless violence.  It was such a waste of time.  If IMDB had negative numbers for voting, I'd give this movie a -5 stars.  Horrible, horrible movie.",2003
3,"It's easy perhaps to understand why films like this get made. Nominally they're lightweight, action thrillers with a catchy theme. In this outing, the theme is ""hacking"", the ability of some shady genius to get into mainframe computers, anywhere, anytime, and work super-scams that will shift millions of dollars - or in this case almost $10 billion - into the bank account(s) of your choosing. It sounds harmless enough, but it all goes badly wrong in ""Swordfish"", and what comes out the other end is a nasty, stupidly obscene film. I have  difficulty imagining why wealthy big-name stars like John Travolta, Halle Berry, Don Cheadle, and Hugh Jackman allow themselves to be involved in this sort of enterprise. Do they really need the money? If the answer is ""yes"", then can someone tell me just how much money such people want or need?",2002

8,"For you action movie buffs out there, Swordfish has enough great action to rival the Action Masters Arnold and James Cameron in, say, True Lies or Bruce Willis in the first Die Hard. The airborne sequences are great and the car chase definitely rumbles. Holly Berry gives us all a great shot of her boobs (thank YOU) and at the end of the movie I only wished there was such a bad guy as this running around taking care of certain kinds of business, especially these days after Sept. 11.",2012
6,"There are a lot more reasons to see ""Swordfish"" than Halle Berry's bare breasts.  Although they are quite awesome, as is the rest of Ms. Berry, you can enough them in the IMDB photo gallery, thanks to Ms. Berry's decision to wear a see through dress to one of the award shows. No, for much of the film, ""Swordfish"" rocks, with plenty of action and two notable performances, Halle Berry and John Travolta.  Sadly,he movie possesses some of producer Joel Silver's usual gaminess and the climax and denouement is not particularly satisfying.  Nonetheless, ""Swordfish"" is a reasonably good romp at the movies, and theres always Halley Berry...",2002

1,"This is a horrible film about horrible people who do horrible things. There are lots of unnecessary explosions to excite the simple-minded: a helicopter gets shot down by a missile, plenty of cars explode, things bang into skyscrapers and cause fear and panic. What more could a male moron want to see? Oh, I forgot, there is of course Halle Berry. She gets to show her tits, wiggle, and stand around in a skimpy bikini bottom, inviting us ('us' must mean men, no woman would sit through this ridiculous film) to think what a great body she still has. By 'still' I mean after, you know, making films and things, which takes it out of a gal so much these days. As for John Travolta, or should I say John Revolta, he gets to look slitty-eyed and ruthless as he gleefully describes how many people he is prepared to torture and murder. Yes, a charming fellow, and the Scientologists can keep him (preferably in a cage). And we must not overlook the fact that Halle Berry gets to deliver the immortal Shakespearian line: 'I'm not here to suck your dick.' Thank goodness! She is so eager to please, I was worried she would jump out of the screen and try it. The art direction and sets are nauseating, the girls wiggling in their thongs are ludicrous, the whole thing stinks. Shall we take up a collection to enable the idiots who made this offensive waste of celluloid to commit mass suicide? That at least would have an iota of drama about it, which this thing which they call a film does not.",2007
10,"The teenagers viewed at the center of Larry Clark's ""Bully"" seem, at least to me, to really have nothing going for them. They have sex almost on a constant basis, drink, smoke pot, drop acid, and have reckless, meaningless lives. It might appear that ""Bully"" could possibly be a darker continuation of his 1995 outing ""Kids,"" which also focused on endangered youth, but I think the questions at this film's core run deeper.",2004
9,"I watched this movie five days ago and I'm still affected by it. Afterwards all I could do was cry for the youth of America, because this isn't just some movie. It really, truly happened. The actors turn in outstanding performances as teenagers with nothing to do but turn to sex and drugs to fill the empty voids in their lives. Nick Stahl is particularly amazing as Bobby, the boarder-line psychotic who tormented his friends until they could take it no more.This is a sad, realistic look at how many teenagers really do act with their peers. Don't look for your typical teenager fare here because you won't find it. The language, sex, and drug use may bother some people, but thats because no one wants to believe that young adults can be this way. Well, I got out of high school two years ago and I can tell you that this is not far from reality. Thats probably why it has affected me so much...because I know that stuff portrayed in this movie really does happen. This is a great movie. Watch it. Then go tell your kids you love them.",2005
9,"Controversial director Larry Clark's based on real-life events ""Bully"" is sometimes quite hard to watch, but you can't quite stop yourself from watching the misadventures of these messed up children either. This film feels so real, so nitty-gritty, that at times, you may feel like an intruder, watching someone else's life. These children are so far removed from being children, it is hard to think that they actually are just children. After all, the concept of a group of kids killing their so-called friend, well, its hardly child's play now is it? The cast are great. Brad Renfro is top-notch in all his performances, here is no exception. Bijou Phillips is great, Rachel Miner is cunning, Kelli Garner is a lot of fun, Michael Pitt is slightly annoying, but entertaining nonetheless. Nick Stahl is intense, to say the least.",2005
9,"This is a interesting and frightening film, worth a viewing by every parent of teenage children. Whether they know it or not, their children at least know children like these; they are living in a world that includes this reality. Some of the best insights are in the portrayals of the parents.",2005
10,"This movie is not for everyone, but if you enjoy gritty realistic dramas and aren't afraid to wallow on the underside of American society, this movie is definitely worth your while. The script and direction are top notch, a refreshing break from the many vapid ""style over substance"" crime thrillers being churned out by rock video hacks and overpaid stars. Production values are excellent; beautiful photography and a charming attractive cast.",2002
8,"There's something about the kids in Larry Clark's films, such as this, Bully, and his 1995 classic Kids (which took place in New York and had the feel of an un-interviewed documentary), where the characters are brought so vividly to life, and their contemplations and actions in their dead-end lives, that I get reminded of the people I was around back in my grade school days (I've been out of the public school system for six months now). I remember the lay-abouts, the complainers, the overly medicated, and of course I remember the bullies, laying on abuse that sometimes they weren't even aware they were inflicting.  ",2002
9,Very real and compelling portrayal of a murder involving a group of teens growing up in suburban Florida. I could relate to the characters on many levels. Growing up in suburban Philadelphia I could have easily replaced the characters in the movie with people I in knew in my youth. It was a rude reminder of just how easily things can spiral out of control if you get involved with the wrong crowd and put yourself in such a precarious situation.,2005
7,"Larry Clark first shocked the film world in 1995 with the explicit and relentless 'Kids'; and that's the movie he has become known for, and will be remembered for. However, Bully is a superior movie in every way.",2004
1,"Lots of teeny/twenty something viewers will wax indignant if one can't see this as a brilliant piece of art. However, if Larry Clark is a genius then why does he deal with the blindingly obvious? Virtually every kid I know has behaved like this; I behaved like this when I was a kid - jeez I'll bet even some of our parents did. Okay - apart from the murder part. It does misuse the 'based on a true story' to portray events - from what I have read it is very, very loosely based on a true story. ",2006
10,"After a friend of mine died in such a similar way, I began to research this story. The real story. I followed all court trials, read all the articles and books. This movie, BULLY, is an excellent portrayal of what really happened. The actors do a great job, especially Nick Stahl, who is the total best. This movie is not for weak stomachs, it is totally gruesome and it holds nothing back. Freaking excellent. If you like true crime and haven't seen this movie, check it out. I give it a 10+++++. NICK STAHL RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",2003
1,"If this review strikes anyone reading it as biased, I apologise, but I have very strong feelings regarding this movie. I saw it in good faith, foolishly believing the critics who poured out their praise. Imagine my shock then when I witnessed possibly the most offensive and worthless creation I have ever seen. The problems I have with 'Bully' and Larry Clark are almost endless, and I will not mention everything here. The characters are vile, and there is nothing there to make you care in the slightest about them. The plot is weak and the script corny and pathetic. The main problem I have with the movie, however, is the apparent perversion of director Clark. Seemingly Clark is the definition of ""dirty old man"", as he has his young actresses nude whenever possible. Almost every scene involves nudity in some form or another. I'm sure Clark will claim he is making a statement about the repetitive and pointless lives of Suburban teenagers, but that seemingly is his excuse to be a pervert. PLEASE do not see this movie! I dont know how I can put my disgust into words any more plainly. DO NOT SEE THIS!",2002
1,"so many other comments say the film is ""astonishing"" but what is astonishing to me is the fact that the people who actually liked Bully can utilize a keyboard. the movie was boring, true event or not. the characters were all stereo-typical and appeared to be mildly retarded. the plot follows these pseudo mongoloids as they plan to kill a main characters boyfriend, who is, as the title implies, a bully. they even go to a hit man for help, though he is neither a hit man, nor of any help at all. there is a lot of warning of drug use and sex in the movie, but neither one of those usually entertaining to watch subjects helps this movie at all. the closest the movie comes to being at all entertaining is Michael Pitt's character, who kind of floats through the movie having no idea whats going on.",2005
1,"Words cannot truly express how awful this movie was.  What is worse, everyone seems to have really enjoyed it.  There is nothing unique about Larry Clark.  All he is is a pedophile who enjoys seeing teenagers strip naked and rut like cockroaches in a tin can.  Truly sickening movie.  There was no character development in this story at all (despite the fact it is apparently true).  The motivations of these kids did not convince me nearly enough.  It seemed to be a completely random decision that they made and, with the horrible script, seemingly unjustifiable.  Larry Clark needs to seek some severe mental counseling and stop trying to make a reputation for himself as the town kiddie-rapist.  NOTE TO DIRECTOR: IT is entirely possible to make a good film and not thrive purely on how riske you can be.",2002

7,"I, like tons of 20-somethings trying to relive their youth, picked up KIDS, the first movie from Larry Clark, a director who loves reality to the point of bypassing actual actors for kids on the street in almost every movie he makes. He loves crime and the demeanor of kids in their early stages of understanding society and people around them.",2005
10,"Let's set the record straight... Larry Clark was the director of Kids, if you hated that, than you might not like this.

But there are different ways in which many people perceive humour, some believe it's all about the jokes, some enjoy the swearing involved and others might love the typical Woody Allen script.",2008
9,"Firstly I want to say: I have to comment this film as reaction to negative commentaries. I found that people who have written attacking commentary must have a bad experience with drugs (I mean light, I count alcohol in this group), or are hypocritical and never taste it. Most people are enjoying talking (and writing) about things that they don't know and that they don't understand. I vote 9 because it is great comedy even I know that most people will not understand 90 percent of jokes. But every voting is subjective, isn't it? So for people who did not see this film ever and maybe they will: don't expect anything, because expectation will make deformation of your feelings and understanding. And If you are apriori of anti-drugs intence: do not see it rather. It is very easy to give it bad evaluation but it is very difficult to make good comedy. Keep it in mind and vote if you like it. And if you liked it, watch it again: you will find another jokes.",2005

From the 1st scene till the last scene,this movie does not stop. There are none not funny scenes to built up the story. You could see is as one funny sketch after the other. The story basically is a guy Silas, who grows weed,and one day his friend dies. He puts his ash in his next plant,that he names after him(The Ivory,still want to smoke that one day). He meets another pod head at THC's(test for higher learning) and with the help of Ivory they get the highest score. And they choose the Ivy League atmosphere of Harvard. They turn Harvard up side down. You have to smoke one before you watch this movie,it's still funny if you don't,but its meant to be seen stoned!!!!

7,"Jesse Dylan's (yes son of Bob Dylan if that's and indication) How High is a concoction of weed, more weed, college and sheer belly laughs.  There is something about marijuana used in comedies that makes the comedy better, though it depends on if the jokes are delivered right and with the right zing.  Cheech and Chong had that to a T and comedies like Half Baked and Friday got pretty close to that tradition, as does this movie which is surprising since this is Method Man and Redman's first comedy together and is co-produced by Danny DeVito.",2001

Anyone looking for a funny movie in this vein try The Wash or one of the Friday movies. How did Fred Willard end up in this boring crap hes the bomb.

7,"Okay, so it won't bring home a little golden guy. . .it's from MTV Films for crying out loud.  But who says everything has to?  I will say this; this movie actually had a little more substance than what I walked in expecting. I went to the theater on opening night with 5 girlfriends expecting to hear some good music and see some good choreography and scenery of Chicago--a city I dearly love.  I got all of that.  But I also got a glimpse of broken homes, the dynamic between a father and daughter who don't know each other, friends who've gone by the wayside that you still don't want to let go of, I could say more.  Oh, and the thing that really still pisses people off though it's 2001. . .interracial relationships.  I'm not saying the plot isn't a little rehashed, but there's not a whole lot that's new out there. No, it's not a great film--I give it a B, but I'd see it again.  In fact I did see it again with another set of friends on Saturday night.  All in all, I saw this movie with 10 friends of varying sex, age and race and all of us liked it.  I think that's a pretty good showing.",2001
7,"Let's get one thing straight.  Teen movies are starting to get unbearable. So it is a relief when something like ""Save the Last Dance"" comes along and offers something up that's just a little off of redundancy.  There seems to be a lot going on here, with the main characters dealing with everything from death of loved ones to single parenthood to racial issues.  You don't see THAT often in teen movies!  But what it really comes down to is DANCE! Julia Stiles plays a former ballet dancer whose dreams are self-imposingly dashed by a tragic event, and the rest of the movie is about her re-chasing her dream in totally different circumstances than what she's used to (mainly: being the only white girl in a rough Chicago all-black neighbourhood).  The movie does touch upon a lot of issues, as previously mentioned, but none of them are explored enough to give  the film a lot of substance.  What does make the film somewhat enjoyable is the dance sequences and the performances.  There seems to be a real chemistry between Stiles (who's great in everything she does!) and Sean Patrick Thomas, who is really talented!  I've only seen him in supporting roles, but this film shows he can be a leading man.  The scene stealer award goes to Kerry Washington, who is so much fun in every one of her scenes.  I hope to see a lot more of her in the future.  IN A NUTSHELL:  It's good to see a teen film that deals with more issues than just prom dates, and it will make you think, but it's not deep enough to be more than just a ""dance"" movie in the same vain as ""Centre Stage"" and ""Dirty Dancing"", culminating in long dance routine by Stiles, and when the routine is over, everything is resolved. Are all the issues REALLY resolved?  Only in Hollywood!! Skippy's Rating: 7/10",2001
6,"Unless you like cheesy MTV-style teenage movies of the ilk of Flashdance, this may not be for you. If you do, it's a well-made piece of that easily digestible junk-food genre. For me, it was interesting mostly because of the dancing (fusion of hip-hop and ballet). There's some interesting performances, even if the editing is there to show the dancefloor moves to a perfection that might not have actually been achieved by Julia Stiles. The standard boy-meets-girl, gets-her-to-realise-her-dream-as-a-dancer-stuff is the stuff large buckets of popcorn were made for . . .",2001

""i have to see this movie"", but naother part of me was going ""but what if this is just another teen film"". I went with my initial instinct and saw the movie and i'm glad i did. This film is so much more than just a teen film. in fact i saw a lot of adults in the audience when i saw it. Save the Last Dance really makes you think about some of the issues that are addressed in the film.",2001

3,"This movie is a sort of updated Romeo and Juliet- meets- Dirty Dancing, and attempts to take on the complex issues surrounding racism and stereotypes while showcasing some fun dancing. Unfortunately, it fails on every level, thanks to a poor script that allows this movie to lapse into the many stereotypes it was hoping to dispel.",2006
6,"I think the title pretty much sums up what I'm going to say in this review. I finally got around to watching 'Save the Last Dance', becoming quite tired of the 'How can you not have seen 'Save the Last Dance', it's the best dance film out there!' comments each time the film came up in conversation. And yes, I enjoyed it, it was a good, entertaining film, but it definitely was not one of the greatest things ever created and I don't think it deserves quite as much hype as it receives.",2008
5,"I had no real information about the film's story, i.e. I didn't realise it was about ballet before hip hop dancing, but it was when I saw the scene spoofed in Scary Movie 2 that I really got into it more. Basically Sara Johnson (The Bourne Trilogy and 10 Things I Hate About You's Julia Stiles) was once an aspiring ballet dancer, but her dream to become a professional was cut short by the death of her mother, and since she has moved in with her father Roy (Terry Kinney). He lives in a predominantly Black neighbourhood, and she has to be transferred to a new school where she is one of the few White students. She finds a friend with small-time ghetto girl Chenille Reynolds (The Last King of Scotland's Kerry Washington), and later she gets to see Sara's ballet ability. Later after starting a friendship with Chenille's brother Derek (Cruel Intentions' Sean Patrick Thomas), he teaches her how her ballet skills can be put to use for an audition (the one she could have had if not for her mother's death). In a really cool scene he teaches some small cool moves, like the spoof in Scary Movie 2, and as time goes by, she gains more and more hip hop moves till she has a routine for the judges. There is the small quarrel between Sara and Derek before this audition happens, but she sticks it out, they make up, and she makes a very good impression with the judges mixing ballet with a bit of hip hop. Also starring Fredro Starr as Malakai, Bianca Lawson as Nikki, Vince Green as Snookie and Garland Whitt as Kenny. Stiles and Thomas are attractive leads, the dance sequences, especially the all important audition are fun to watch, and the soundtrack (including songs from Fatman Scoop, Ice Cube and Blaqout) is very good, and not too much sentimentality to sour the film, a crowd-pleasing dance/music film. Worth watching!",2008
1,"Ok I am not going to waste alot of time on this as I have already wasted enough on this movie. Someone commented earlier about they would have liked to see a black girl try to be white instead. RIGHT ON! I am SO tired of black people being shown as the oppressed and ""cooler"" race while whenever white people complain about other races they are viewed as ""racists"". This double standard alone kills this movie as well as the predictable pathetic plot. The characters are overacted as well as lousy dance routines which add a layer of desperation to this movie. Do yourself a favor and watch Unbreakable instead.",2001
2,"Lame script, bad directing. The school scenes were so unrealistic -- c'mon, on her very first day at school a black girl completely befriends her out of nowhere and treats her like she's her best friend, even sticking up for her to every other girl in school. Couldn't they at least have set it up better, where Sarah does something to gain her trust, or her friend has a white parent, or anything interesting? Something besides no reason or charity work.",2004

1,"to say that this movie deals with difficult issues is complete BS. the 5 minutes devoted in the plot to deal with sub-issues of teen pregnancy, divorce, and father daughter relationships hardly qualifies. honestly, the first several times i watched this movie, i turned it off an hour into it because it was so boring. i had to come back to it and watch it from the beginning several times before i could stop falling asleep. the only reason i actually watched it the whole way through is because i wanted to make an educated comment here. someone earlier said that it was a ""sleeper"". they were right... but i don't think they meant it the way i do.",2002
1,"It's very rare that a film comes along that's truly worthless but 'Save the Last Dance' is most certainly it. Thomas Carter has created a film full of embarrassing black stereotypes. We have the males; 'gangstas' and guys trying to forget their criminal pasts (if you are a black male in this movie, than you MUST have some form of criminal past) and the women, who are crack-ho's or single mothers. Enter Julia Stiles prissy little white ballerina who has daddy-issues but being white, is the only decent person with a squeaky clean past. The only way black people will accept her, is if she alters her ballerina classical training by embracing r'n'b or gyrating on the dance floor to hip-hop. She must also learn to talk like she is auditioning for a female version of 'Malibu's Most Wanted', although sadly this is no comedy. This might on a good day be considered a forgivable piece of film-making but add to this dialogue written by a retarded child (a look at the 'bitch' argument in the school gym drives this point home) and you have a film that's both poorly made and offencive. The soothing thing is this predictable bland nonsense is most audiences will get what exactly what they need to reinforce black and white stereotypes....the disturbing thing is it's popularity and acceptance as a 'feel good harmless film'. In an ideal world this would be banned...or better still not made at all. Fortunatly later attempts at this, like the recent 'Take the Lead' handle this subject with a little more competency.",2006

I have seen so many great movies lately (such as Fight Club, Gladiator, Memento, Snatch) so the only good thing about Save the Last Dance was to give me some perspective about the good movies from the bottom. I pity the people involved in this movie... and the audience.",2002

This summer, I had several opportunities to see this film and of course took those chances because I just couldn't stop laughing at this film, no matter how I knew what would happen in the next scene. It has great humor and great chemistry that we haven't seen between two actors since Mel Gibson and Danny Glover.",2001

Then when i heard that they were making Rush Hour 2 I couldn't wait until it came out, however i was worried that it might not be as good as the first as very few sequels are these days, but i was not disappointed in the slightest. I laughed all the way through this movie and even more than the first one. Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker are perfect for the roles and both are excellent throughout the movie which has even more humor than Rush Hour 1. Rush Hour 1 is still excellent but i think Rush Hour 2 has to be funnier having watched them both hundreds of times. I cannot wait until Rush hour 3 comes out!",2003

Both actors create likable characters with slightly more depth to them than the average comedic archetypes. Tucker is a loudmouthed clown from the LAPD, and Chan is a quiet, methodical Chief Inspector from Hong Kong. Not just racial stereotypes, their characters are developed just enough to make you want more from them - particularly Chan's.",2005
8,"Some might say, hearing about Rush Hour 2: Not another sequel! / Not another cop buddy film!' and so on. But with these kinds of films, it is not so much originality at all. It is about being entertained.

Either way: THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN",2001

A deadly gang are destroying buildings with bombs, and Carter and Lee (originally on vacation) are assigned to find the gang. Lee has the past haunting him during the process, because the gang leader, Ricky Tan (John Lone) killed his Dad. Carter is funny at being loud talking, and Lee is good at all his stunts.

Lee is on the case again, in his town, but of course, James just wants to 'Par-tay' ""I want some moo-shoe man!"" Carter quips, ""Oh you are hungry?"" Lee inquires to his friend and guest. Nope! Carter is looking for some 'action' of the female species, again. Always. They are getting literally no where until, they reach The 'States' again, and it all takes off! On the trail off a cold-blooded mafioso killer. These two are to naive to be scared, well at least one of them anyway. The pressure is on and getting hotter, they take a lead that gets them through into a semi-truck all tied up. When they figure on their demise in this situation, thanks to Lee's insight, they work had and break-free!! Along the way of breaking from it, they accidentally stumble onto a load of C-notes hidden in some artistic statues. Carter sees them and picks up a couple",2006
10,"The above sums it up pretty much. It's a bit better than the first, and the martail arts sequences with Jackie Chan as always were a pleasure. And surprisingly enough, Chan and Tucker have very good comedic chemistry. One of those weird facts of life I guess. 3/5 stars-",2002
9,This movie is very enjoyable. Tucker's comments are toned down and ease the pain of the first movie. Chan once again does a great job of doing awesome stunts. This movie takes place in Hong Kong so it also adds to the fun. They also stop by LA and head to Las Vegas. Chan and Tucker have great chemistry in this film. The bad guys are more believable here than in the first. Chan and Tucker provide hilarious moments. The fight in the massage parlor is THE best fight sequence I've ever seen not to mention the funniest. We gets some new characters that provide some hilarious moments. Like I said before the villains are better here and they also have a better plot. The plot is existent throughout the film and it adds to the nice pace of the movie. You'll enjoy this one more than the first. Cant wait for Rush Hour 3.,2006

It is at this point in the film when all kinds of problems start to take place, and the bad guy who is in on all sorts of rackets comes face to face with Inspector Lee and the stunts and all kinds of action is enacted through out the entire picture. There is great photography around Hong Kong and more action than you can handle. Enjoyed this film more than Rush Hour #1.",2006

Lee confronts Tan on his yacht; it looks as though he is about to ask for protection when he is shot by Hu Li, a beautiful female assassin who worked for him. Carter notices a LA based billionaire hotelier on the yacht so assumes he must be behind whatever Tan had been smuggling. Lee and Carter head to LA, where events lead them to Isabella Molina, a secret service agent they'd first met in Hong Kong; she tells them that she is looking for printing plates for making 'superdollars'; near perfect forged hundred dollar bills.

10,"Actor-comedian Chris Tucker cracks me up every time he tells a joke. He captivated me the first time that I saw him clowning around as the character Smoky in director F. Gary Gray's riotous 'N the Hood' farce ""Friday"" (1995) with Ice-Cube. Tucker attained outlandish heights with his unforgettable coiffure and his loose-lipped loquacity as the ridiculous Ruby Rhod in director Luc Besson's sci-fi extravaganza ""The Fifth Element"" (1997) with Bruce Willis. Anybody that supports the American Rifle Association should praise Tucker, too. In director Brett Ratner's ""Money Talks"" (1997), the Tucker hero, Franklin Hatchett, summed up his philosophy about guns. ""Guns don't kill people,"" Hatchett ranted, ""Stupid motherf*@kers with guns kill people!"" Probably the giddiest moments of director Quentin Tarantino's ""Jackie Brown"" (1998) featured nappy headed Tucker arguing with villainous Samuel L. Jackson about climbing in the trunk of Jackson's car. Tucker has rejected movie offers left and rightly largely because nobody wanted to pay his asking price. No matter how astronomical Tucker's salary demands may have seemed, Ice-Cube definitely blew it when he left Smoky out of ""Next Friday."" As a result, ""Next Friday"" pales by comparison with ""Friday."" New Line Cinema, which produced the ""Rush Hour"" thrillers, learned it lesson from Ice-Cube's disaster. Mind you, Mike Epps is funny, but he isn't Chris Tucker funny! Nobody could possibly fill Tucker's shoes in either ""Next Friday"" or ""Rush Hour 2!"" They paid the Def Jam stand-up comic from Decatur, Georgia, a whopping $20-million so he would reprise his ""Rush Hour"" role as LAPD Detective James Carter opposite Jackie Chan in director Brett Ratner's turbo-driven sequel. Producers Arthur Sarkissian, Roger Birnbaum, Jay Stern, and Jonathan Glickman spent their bucks wisely. The comedian chemistry between Tucker and Chan, surely the oddest couple of mismatched cops ever, has lost none of its spontaneity. Altogether, ""Rush Hour 2"" proves a hundred times more satisfying than its tame 1998 blockbuster predecessor.",2008

True, there's no big ideas behind this film like there were in ""Dogma"" or ""Chasing Amy,"" but really, the grand ideas in those movies came from the main characters, not Jay and Silent Bob. They were there for comic relief mainly. Therefore, it makes sense that ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" would be pure slapstick comedy.

Now I kind of dig the man myself, liked a few of his films-hated a few more, but I entered the theatre as more of a impartial film fan rather than Kevin Smith nut.  Keep that in mind as I say these words: Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is one of the most horrible pieces of nonsense ever put to film.  It was so bad I expected Pauly Shore to have a few lines.  The titular characters are really not interesting enough to carry an entire movie, especially seeing that one is silent.  After 90 minutes the voice of Jay was an inch away from giving me a seizure.  Crude and stupid, in all of the bad ways, this film puts a black mark next to the name of a filmmaker who really isn't all that talented in the first place.  Luckily these characters are being retired, hopefully a forced change of scenery will force Smith into making a film that isn't horrible.",2001

I guess he must have stitched together the lamest bits that didn't make it into those films to creat 9and I use that term loosely) this one.",2001
1,"I used to think Kevin Smith was a good director. He made two great comedy/dramas-Clerks and Chasing Amy-that I admired very much. His latest film, however, is the work of a sell out and an insult to the intelligence of moviegoers everywhere. It seems that the main impetus for the film being made was Kevin Smith's fragile ego not being able to take criticism over the internet. In place of the wit and insight of Smith's best films, this movie has phony hollywood stars trying to be self-deprecating, mindless profanity, and ridiculous situations that make no sense. Even Chris Rock isn't funny in this movie. Please don't waste your time on this awful disgrace to celluloid.",2001

Stoner humour is not my normal genre, cheech and chong bored me, as did many other films based around the same sort of thing.

8,"Whatever went wrong with Kevin Smith's 1995 film Mallrats has been fixed in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. Now in 2001, Kevin Smith devotes ninety-five minutes of film to himself. Any negative reviews you may read are surely written by critics who weren't big fans of Smith's previous efforts (especially Mallrats). J&SBSB is a movie for the View Askew fans. The film contains many references to Clerks (1994), Mallrats (1995), Chasing Amy (1997), and Dogma (1999) as well as the Clerks comic books and the Jay and Silent Bob comic book, Chasing Dogma, that bridges the gap between Chasing Amy and Dogma (actually, a great deal of the film's road trip comes directly from this book).",2001
2,"Having enjoyed Clerks and most of Chasing Amy and Dogma this is an incredibly inept flick. Which got tiresome quicker? The flatulence and oral sex jokes or the ""acting"" of director Smith? The shrugs, eyerolls, the hand gestures. Ugh. Also, how many times do you have to say the f-word? And how many times do you have to mention what a slimepit Miramax is? It must be pretty bad because they're responsible for bringing this to a theater near me. In that vein, how does Smith expect his mostly college-aged audience to react to repeated references to Miramax? ""Ooh this film was made by Miramax, it MUST be..."" Who goes to a movie based on the studio or production company? For a movie that supposedly rails against Hollywood (see tagline) this is an incredible supposition. This is about as anti-studio as ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"". This film also proves that any movie which relies on a steady stream of walk-ons (unless it is directed by Robert Altman) is doomed to failure.",2001
1,"If anyone has to refuse people to be allowed in to see one of his junior high movies then, something is wrong.

Completely stunned would be close to how I felt sitting through this trash. Following the 'Wayans Pattern' of once putting great stuff out then quickly decomposing to trash is what I would say about Smiths stuff thus far. I can't believe a writer with his talent degraded to 'drooling idiot fanbase' level. His previous movies always had insight combined with wit and fantastic dialogue. This 'thing' had none of that. The fact that he even stooped to the 'white guy' jokes with that racist idiot Chris Rock,was a major disappointment.

Not only did I not hear one funny line the entire episode, but who ever was working the canned laughter button (every laugh track was the same pitch and length, and nothing was funny) needed to pick his or her moments. Sitcoms that are actually funny don't have the audience laughing every 3 seconds, let alone shows with no funny lines.

All I'll say right now is that I laughed really hard at that episode.

I was kind o shocked at Norton playing a handy-capped young man in this as well as he pulled it off. He just stole the show in the midst of the plot too! It was a treat to see Brando and DeNiro sitting talking it out at the bar in the middle of town. The story was an exciting setting-up of a heist that these men are all about. This is their line. On top of the style of the story overall I loved the fact that DeNiro's character owned a jazz lounge club and had a townhouse above it. That would be my favorite type of living arrangement. The deception that Norton's man brought was building for a long time at his job and he being the inside man was looking at being recognized the fastest and overall he was the one that worked in the company not the other men in his crew. So he was the one with his neck on the chopping block if authorities put two and two together. This is a great story that has style and a sharp twist together.",2007

Also though another elements is from director Frank Oz, who is a household name (at least for me) by being a muppeteer since 1963 and has also directed some hits (Bowfinger, What About Bob) and misses (In and Out, Stepsitter).  Now he tackles his first crime drama, and he does it exceptionally well in holding the suspense in a way that will hold it all together, unlike some thrillers that always pop up suspense and by the time the end comes your tired out from it all.  While The Score holds a couple of things also that keep it from greatness (Angela Basset's character isn't really needed for DeNiro's motivations and also the trailer revealed too much of the movie so that the movie had to try extra hard to be thrilling), it also holds controlled and outstanding performances and crackerjack suspense throughout.

9,"Edward Norton is one of the best actors working today, and Robert DeNiro and Marlon Brando are among the best film actors in history, so it is to be expected that a good film would result from a combined effort from all three of them. DeNiro plays Nick, a veteran break-in artist who is forced to do one last score before his plan to fade into blissfully obscure retirement with his clichéd girlfriend, and who doesn't like the entire set-up from the beginning. Norton plays the characters of Jack (the man who investigated and set-up the heist from the beginning) and Brian (the man who works as a janitor at the building where the priceless scepter is kept, and who pretends to be mentally challenged to avoid drawing attention to himself). You can't help comparing these performances to his similar roles as Aaron and Roy in Primal Fear, which was Norton's second best performance ever, second only to his role as Derek Vineyard in American History X and followed closely by his Jack in Fight Club.

Edward Norton delves into Arnie Grape territory with his janitor alter ego, but Leo still did it better.  Angela Bassett is along as The Girl, as she has no identity outside DeNiro.  She also doesn't seem to be having the time of her life. ",2001
9,"The Score is an above average heist movie focused on a master thief (Robert DeNiro) who accepts a job which forces him to take on a partner (Edward Norton) and break all of his own rules of doing business for the possibility of a big payoff. Both of the leads are very convincing in their roles, particularly Edward Norton, who really plays two completely different roles here. Bringing them together is Max, well played by Marlon Brando, in what can be considered a cameo role. Once the caper begins, the tension builds steadily and the plot twists begin, leading to a very satisfying climax. The jazz-inspired score fits the movie well and is reminiscent of those from the great 70's caper flicks. The film's only flaw is the slow-moving romantic-interest plot, which really isn't necessary anyway. It would have been more effective the filmmakers had focused more on the planning and execution of the heist in even more detail and found another way to frame the film (perhaps using the Brando character), but all in all this is a very good Heist movie with a rich payoff ending. It is a fabulous looking movie as well, with noir-ish, rich, dark tones. An old fashioned caper, carefully made, this is what going to the movies is all about, or should be.",2005

Also, the kung-fu/wirework action set pieces work well with Seagal's Aikido skills, and he does move about a fair bit in the film.

It opens with a scene that bears nothing to anything. Steven Seagal rescues a public figure and authority comes down on him for it. Seagal is sent to anger management seminars and suspects foul play regulated by members of the police force. He teams with Isaiah Washington to find answers as well as support the whole idea of this being the umpteenth bad buddy cop film. This all arrives at the ever familiar violent solution. Sloppy directing by Andrzei Bartkowiak who throws in the justified violence theme for good measure. Seagal isn't any different here than in any other film where he beats up countless people. The only difference is that here he seems to have an unlimited amount of handcuffs. In really awful supporting roles are Washington as well as DMX and Anthony Anderson. Michael Jai White appears in what is as bad as another film he did called Universal Soldier: The Return. What is even worse about this junk is how the audience reacted to it.

I'm honestly not sure why this became a hit for Seagal. It's certainly not bad, but there is really nothing all that special about it. It has plenty of lame comedy, thanks to the unfunny Tom Arnold, and some admittedly funny lines by Steven Seagal. It doesn't embarrass itself in the action department. It has a great opening, and Seagal does do some of his trademark bone crunching, and seems to be relatively in shape, unfortunately Seagal's laziness was starting to commence as well. There are some laughable kickboxing moves, which do not seem to be coming from Seagal. The story itself is familiar. Seagal's ""Orrin Boyd"" character is a little bit like Serpico. ",2013

It is being displaced by the cops 'n robbers, grisly hero shoot'em-ups and a variety of other overly violent superhero vehicles.  As a kid, I grew up on Westerns and could not get enough of them.  The bad guys always wore black hats and the hero, like Roy Rogers, Gene Autry and others always wore the white hats coming to the rescue of the ladies at the last moment.  Villains were slime-suckers and deserved all they got.  I mean, who could even feel a twinge of regret when Joel McCrea shot Brian Donlevy in the Virginian after he engineered Sonny Tufts getting hung?  Well, this film loosely based on a Louis L'Amour story takes us back to a time when heros were just that: bigger than life figures that placed honor, decency and the love of their horses above the petty greed and avarice of the weaker villains.  Selleck is outstanding in this role as Rafe Covington who comes to ""take care of"" the widow of a friend (whom we later learn he knew but a short time).  What commitment!  Now, we get some growls here from the peanut gallery from some who fail to understand the archetype the Western Hero is based on and even one faithful Louis L'Amour fan who cries foul at the departures from the original.  OK.  We can let that go.  Someone observes that Selleck leaving his Magnum PI role is a ""natural"" for Westerns.  I second that!  He does. His pals, veteran character actor Wilfred Brimley, Kane and O'Hara add texture to the hero role while the villains are outright scumbags, especially usual good-guy Mark Harmon and refugee from the rapture, Brad Johnson (glad he made it out of the apocalypse).  These baddies are REAL bad. Cheap made-for-TV has-been Western flick?  No way, José.  This is FINE entertainment and I wish they had a lot more of it.",2001
9,This was a surprise gem that we rented on dvd. The directing and cinematography are excellent. Mark Harmon is wonderfully evil. Tom Selleck the hero....but with support of friends.  Great cast all around. Beautiful scenery. A very enjoyable movie.,2003
9,"The performances were non-cliche (a rarity in westerns), script was tight, locations in Calgary were beyond stupendous, and Tom Selleck brings a humanity to a tough cowboy that few actors, if any, can bring. He's the most charismatic and likeable of all leading western actors today. Best television show I've seen in ten years. Hats off to TNT for the foresight.",2001
8,"I don't like modern Westerns. Even as meticulously accurate a history as 1993's Tombstone, with all the contributing artists turning in splendid job performances, left me cold because at the end of the movie all that stayed with me was the mind-numbing brutality of ceaseless violence.",2003
10,Tom Selleck and co-stars did honor to Mr.L'Amour's story. It is time Westerns made a come back- lots of action-no raunchy sex- no filthy language-the good guy wins.  The scenery is beautiful-though the houses looked fake-and the history was on target. If I wore a hat I'd tip it to all involved with the making of Crossfire Trail- Now Mr Selleck and Sam Elliot need to make one together. Thank You for some good entertainment.,2001
8,"I enjoyed this. Nothing out of the ordinary. Great Casting. Sellect and Brimley are very enjoyable and believable. Great scenery. Nicely shot. This is a western. Black and white are the paint of choice. And after perusing the 24hr moviechannels line up I truly am amazed how many truly bad movies are made. This isn't one of them. Plus the added bonus was these actors left the ""open range"" pretty much the way the came in. Respectful and Gracious.",2004

7,"Though the story is entirely formulaic, gorgeous Canadian backgrounds and excellent casting give ""Crossfire Trail"" a formidable presence on the small screen courtesy of cable mainstay TNT. I never could quite picture Tom Selleck in Westerns following his 'Magnum PI' days, but he's entirely convincing here as Rafe Covington, fulfilling a dying wish to a friend who was shanghaied and beaten to death. His arch rival is town boss Bruce Barkow (Mark Harmon), who's effectiveness as a villain requires him to overcome his good looks and fine manners. Maybe that's why he's such a great bad guy, even without a black hat; his nasty turn near the end of the story runs completely against any stereotype you may have of him from his earlier work. But if the devil is in the details, you really have to admire the casting of the supporting players. The part of Joe Gill doesn't look like it would fit Wilford Brimley, but Brimley makes it his as he takes up with Rafe's cause. William Sanderson as the bartender starts out one dimensionally until that fateful stand he takes in defense of Anne Rodney (Virginia Madsen), and wait, didn't Barry Corbin look and sound just great channeling Edgar Buchanan as Sheriff Moncrief?

9,"What a great movie.  Since I was a small child, the genre of the cowboy western has enthrawled me.  The photography is incredible, being filmed in the Canadian Rockies shows the unspoiled West,  the love of the land they show in trying to protect and use it wisely.  Authentic clothing and weaponry enhance the enjoyment of the picture.  I believe the same director was in Quigley Down Under.  After all, what else do you need if you have Cowboys, guns, horses, good guys and bad guys.  I hope Mr. Selleck continues to make fine westerns.  Everyone that has seen this movie has come away impressed with the quality and timeless story of honoring a promise and carrying it out.  Doing what is right, even though the consequences may be high. Thank you all to those that help make this picture,  and thankyou to Turner Network Television.",2001
8,"For those who thought his career began and ended with Magnum, P.I., it's a pleasant surprise to find Tom Selleck has become a credible and familiar face in--surprise, surprise--westerns. This classic Louis L'Amour story seems tailor made for the tall, rugged actor who is apparently just as comfortable on a horse as in a Ferrari. With Mark Harmon playing the essential villain, Virginia Madsen playing the not-so-helpless widow, Selleck gives us the quintessential western hero, an average guy just trying to make good on a promise to a dead friend. While the gunplay may not be appropriate for young children, this is a film with both high quality of production and high quality of content for all viewers.",2001
10,"I am an avid fan of westerns. No one is a bigger fan of the greats like John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart, and Clint Eastwood, however if we are going to be realistic about westerns I have to go with Tom Selleck's characters. He does a great job. This classic has been researched very well. I am also a gun enthusiast and the weaponry was VERY accurate in this and all of the movies done by Selleck and Wincer. I also like the attention to detail concerning little things that Louis L'amour would pay attention to. If you will remember when Rafe braced Snake Corville he pulled the leather thong off of the hammer of his sixgun(which I think was a Smith and Wesson). This is a re-occurring theme in L'amour's books.This movie may never get the praise it deserves in the world of westerns but what a great one it is. I hope Tom Selleck does more of these.",2005
6,"Though it's well-photographed on attractive locations and features an above-average cast, the story is tired and familiar, and the climactic shootout downright silly. A herd of cattle in the middle of a small town (with no railroad--so why are the cattle in town at all?) wanders about in the middle of a blazing gunfight without so much as a horn being nicked. Bullets slam into the swinging doors of a saloon--we see splinters fly--without moving them a micrometer.",2004
4,"Weak, dull and extremely predictable western adventure where a gunman (Selleck) comes to a small town to defend a young and beautiful widow (Madsen) of a bad and ruthless rich man (Harmon) who practically owns all the city. A peasant direction, cardboard performances and a ludicrous ending make this one a bad choice. I give this a 4 (four).",2001

7,"A dark and meticulous tale, based around the murders of Jack the Ripper in Whitechapel, London. The films look is no more than what you would expect from a one based on Jack the Ripper. Dark shadows loom over the characters as the satanic nature of The Ripper is emphasised. It's such an intriguing story and character that every time I watch a film based on this story I come away slightly disappointed. This time was no exception. While the acting was good (minus some quite unconvincing cockney accents - Heather Graham and Johnny Depp, I'm talking to you) and the direction assured, the script seemed a little reserved. There was no great insight into any of the characters, and much of it played out like a simple murder mystery. But this didn't stop me from enjoying the 120 or so minutes. ",2003

9,"I had always been fascinated by the story of Jack the Ripper, but surprisingly this was my first film based on the story. From Hell is an outstanding mystery and a dark, moody film. This is the type of film that sticks in your mind days after seeing it. You'll have the image of old Whitechaple in your head. You'll have the terrific murder scenes stuck in your head, but most of all you'll have the image of Jack the Ripper in your head. From Hell will disturb you. It might scare you, and it might even bore you (action fans will not enjoy this film). From Hell is certainly not for everyone, but it certainly was for me.",2001
10,"I wasn't expecting much from this movie. The critics passed it over rather quickly, saying a few kind words but without a strong recommendation. The couple of people I knew who saw this said that it was ""good,"" but never cared to say much more than that and have never brought it up again. As I sat down to watch it, I thought it looked nice but moved too fast, was a little dumb. But by the end, I was astounded. I think it's one of the best films of 2001. Sure, it's a triumph of style over substance, but I think we need a couple of good films like this every year. I love style.",2002

The ending is brilliant! If you're see this film expecting to be entertained, you will be. If you see this film to seek validation of your Ripper theories, you may not like it!

The actual Ripper story drips with drama, mystery, enigma, colourful individuals, should I go on? No, but some third rate, coca-cola drinking scenario writer thought the American public would be better off with some fifteenth rate love story soap. It could even be oscar material. Let me tell him or they, thanks to this 'penny-novel' approach, every well made, well acted and sometimes brilliant visual approach was destroyed thoroughly for me. Victorian England was something else. One piece of advice: check your sources well, if you used sources other than your bank account. A good advice: don't be confronted with European historians or you will end up like... To conclude: Jack the Ripper doesn't translate to Disneyworld.

I am not saying I know who is, many theories abound, but the 'Queen Victoria sending her personal physician out to kill the prostitutes that gave her son VD' is one of the more laughable. ",2001
1,"I was appalled to see that yet another version of the famous ""Jack The Ripper"" has come and was unsure as to how this one would pan out compared to the rest. Happily, it did not compare to the rest. This film not only took the legend that is ""Jack The Ripper"" and made it in a farcical romance but took a dimwitted view of the monarchy. How can the directors in their right mind sanctioned a film like this without doing their research. And on top of that, took the time to make out that a possible romance could have happened ?. If they think that they could get away with producing crap of this magnitude, then it is another attempt to ""crap"" on the English with a pathectic attempt to re-create what can only be described as ""The most unsolved and greatest who-dunnit"" in modern times.  If anyone is thinking of renting this out, I would strongly advise against this as they will be dissappointed to the brink of switching it off.  I hope that in the future, someone will take the time to make a version which contains a lot more of the facts and not pure speculation as this film did.

Although that's a positive endorsement of the film--it's rare that a film has me basically speechless afterward (I usually suffer from logorrhea, which sounds close enough to diarrhea that you could call it (verbal) flatulence instead if you like)--it turned out to be quite a problem, because we went to dinner right afterward and I had to give a lecture.

9,"I haven't been a fan of Sean Penn's since Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Since that time, nearly all his films have left me flat. In fact, I nearly didn't watch this film since he was in it. What a loss it would have been if I'd missed it! I won't go into the story line since that's been reviewed a lot by others. The story is sort of a cliché'd one and has been done before, though not as well. The story isn't this film's strength anyway - it's the acting. Rarely have I seen a film with this much powerful acting. Penn's performance as Sam is brilliant! He must have studied autistic/mentally challenged people to pull this performance off. I also want to mention how good Michele Pfeiffer was in this. Her character starts out as a hard-hearted witch and ends up being very human, thanks to her exposure to Sam. The change in her is gradual, subtle and fun to watch. Sams friends, very well played by Brad Silverman, Joseph Rosenberg, Stanley DeSantis and Doug Hutchinson are very important support characters. Laura Dern gives a stellar performance as Randy. Dakota Fanning as Lucy very nearly steals the show. This little actress has quite a career ahead of her, I hope! This film is delicately balanced, and has a good bit of humor interspersed with parts that will have even the most insensitive of you reaching for a tissue. The film has a sort of a sappy (and somewhat surprising) outcome, but by this time any other ending would have been pretty much unacceptable to most people. This movie blew me away and I gave it a 9.",2002

This movie is utterly beautiful, so feel it deeply and follow to the end of the story about Sam struggling for the right to return his daughter Lucy Diamond home. Truly Inspiring. Although, personally I felt certain scenes needed improving; of course with some as great as could be. Finally, the film has a great message: Does being educated prove you to be a worthy parent?

In the history of American animated TV series I have never seen such great craftmanship...  The backgrounds are exquisite.  Painted, airbrushed, computer-generated -I DON'T CARE!!!  They are beautful.  Not only in it's execution but it's scheer originality and beauty.  The lack of symmetry and use of light and odd colors add to its uniqueness and effect.  It adds so much to the wonder of the bizarre Aku-ruled Earth.  ACTION!  SO MUCH ACTION!!!!  Wonderful, swift, exciting and technically magnificent.  The fight scenes are choreographed wonderfully and just plain EXCITING!!! I've never said that about any animated show!  Jack's eyes and movements flow sweetly and say so much.  Very few cartoons come across so well (Ren & Stimpy is an exception) with such grace and simplicity without losing it's integrity.  But the artwork isn't the end of it:  GREAT WRITING!!!  What's that?  Writing?  Wha?  Yes.  The terrific stories and engaging characters are just as electric and fresh as the artwork that represents it.  Every time I watch an episode there is always something I don't expect.  So much creativity pours from either the animator's pens or the writer's pens. BEST ANIMATED SHOW OF ALL TIME.

The music is wonderful also, a perfect mix of oriental and electronic sounds really add to the authenticity. The story lines are superb and interesting springing from a great idea, and the writing is top notch, funny and intelligent.

Episode plots range from dark and epic to lighthearted and comic, but often contain little dialogue.

We are accustomed to being flattered as an audience, sent home feeling good that ""our"" side wins in the end against the evil.  In this film that stereotypical and simplistic Good vs Evil is taken apart.  The revenge leaves us feeling unusually unsettled, which is a very good thing in a deeper sense.",2003

9,"A rarity in modern cinema, In the Bedroom is a movie for thinking adults that is one of the most thorough yet subtle examinations of violence and its consequences I've ever seen. Tom Wilkerson gives a masterful and restrained performance, and Sissy Spacek and nearly everyone else is uniformly excellent. Although it is a searing and unflinching look at nearly unspeakable grief, it is poignant and thoughtful and even has scenes of humor if you are ready for it. Todd Field's screenplay is one of the most brilliant in recent memory.      I really wish we had more mature stuff like this coming out of Hollywood. Powerful films that deal with violence and its aftermath and meaning like this make films like Kill Bill look even more repellent than they already are.",2004
10,"So simple.  So honest.  So heartbreaking.  I dare you to see this movie and not go through a self-invasive, heartfelt understanding for the familial and emotional conflicts these characters go through.  one of the best films shown at Sundance, hands down.  Not a movie for the emotionally squeamish...brutally powerful...  Violent, excruciating truth and beauty...the raw emotional power imbued into the scenes with Wilkinson and Spacek are Oscar-worthy.  Marisa Tomei finally gets a role worthy of her talent since My Cousin Vinny.  Utterly unforgettable, and a slam-dunk certainty for some kind of oscar, whether screenplay, acting, or directorial.",2001

10,"Everything about this film is wonderfully done, from the restrained direction and acting, to the inexorable progression to tragic conclusion following preceding events. All the actors and acting are excellent, with a particularly subtle and brilliant portrayal by Tom Wilkinson as Dr. Fowler. Always great, he is, in my estimation, one of the unsung and underrated actors in film today. Sissy Spacek is also wonderful, and the inevitable emotional fall-out in their relationship after their shared experience is beautifully done. Very human - and very real. ",2006
9,"An exceptional film which emulates the astounding talents of Tom Wilkinson. I thought he was OK in The Full Monty, but he is exceedingly well cast in the role of father who is grieving inside the loss of his only child. Tom acts with intelligence and resounding compassion as a man driven to revenge. The film is delivered and directed with a slow build up of tension towards a shocking and absorbing climax. This film offers great performances from the ensemble of actors and is directed intelligently. It maybe a tragic and slow film but it will leave the audience empathising with the characters rather than sympathising with them. A truly remarkable and contemporary film.",2006
9,"This movie was so well done, I felt as if I were an outsider, looking through someone's window. Then the tragedy occurs, we were treated to what probably would have happened after a crime of passion, the imprecision of the evidence, the lack of a witness, and the ability of the perpetrator to avoid prosecution. Mostly the movie is about acting. Sissy Spacek is amazing, so tightly wound and in control. Her somewhat passive husband becomes her foil until the fuse is lit. Then it all comes to a head. I can't imagine living through something like this where your allies become so worthless. There is a scene where the prosecuting attorney jingles his change and looks at his watch while spouting a bunch of meaningless jargon about justice. The father goes catatonic while this is happening. Things play out like they do in life; there are no winners and no losers.",2009

1,"I wanted to like this film so much, but I can't help feeling that I was cheated out of two hours of my life that I can never get back.  The main problem lies in the fact that this is supposed to be a realistic look at tragic events in a small town and the emotional devastation two parents feel over the murder of their son.  Yes, most of the acting was naturalistic and nuanced, but I didn't buy for a single moment any of the main turn of events.  I blame this on a hackneyed script and over confident director (Todd Field seemed to be screaming ""Oh, look at me, I can do long meditative shots of pretty drapes blowing in a breeze, oh, aren't I artistic?"").",2003

It builds up to its Big Dramatic Event much earlier than most movies, then spends the majority of the film exploring the event's aftermath and how the characters cope.

3,"Given that ""Scary Movie"" was a huge hit, I can understand the studio wanted to strike while the iron was hot. This sequel came out less than a year after the original, they really wanted to make sure the audience hadn't forgotten the first one yet. Sadly, the time pressure is very apparent. This whole movie just seems very unfinished, lots of scenes look like blueprints of something that could potentially be funny. Take the scenes with the handicapped character for instance, those had so much more potential than they actually showed. Other scenes however are just plain lazy and repetitive. Yeah, Shorty still smokes weed, the gay guy is still gay, Cindy is still ditzy and Brenda is still loud. Nothing new or creative is done with any of these characteristics, the actors just routinely reprise their stereotypes wondering when they're finally going to get a funny line. At 83 minutes, this movie is really quite short, but it's still packed with needless filler material and jokes that just appear to be rejected material from the first one. Very disappointing flick.",2011

The interpretation was still very good, and Keenan Ivory Williams is still able to direct his movie, but let's just say it's not as funny and as organized as the first Scary Movie. Yeah, you get a laugh every once a while, but still, that's not enough to make this movie one of my favourites. It's watchable, but still, as I said many times, Scary Movie 1 is way much better. The Wayans brothers are still pretty good, but I've seen a lot better (and funnier) results from them than from Scary Movie 2.",2008

1,"How would you define 'film'? If you define it as something that's filmed and put together, I suppose that you could claim that this falls under that definition, but if you define it as something that has structure, continuity and meaning, then this isn't a film. It's just a bunch of gags and scenes(badly) cut together. Every single character that you hated in the first, and was glad to see die, has returned, including a few new cliché characters to hate. The film is entirely carried by stereotypes, and tries continually to make you laugh at stuff that anyone with just a tiny amount of moral wouldn't laugh at if his or her life depended on it. Stuff like homosexuality, the physically and/or mentally disabled, junkies, etc. The list goes on, but I really don't feel like typing it all here. The gags and jokes are powerfully unfunny. I think I smirked once during the film, and that's it. The humor obviously tries to offend, and it certainly succeeds; they just forgot to make it funny, in the process of thinking up stuff that will make plenty of people find the film disgusting(what's wrong with the Wayans', anyway?). The humor consists entirely of tired clichés, worn-out stereotypes, gross-out comedy, and bad spoof sequences. Throughout the entire run-time(which is less than 90 minutes, what's wrong Wayans', did you run out of material?), there was only one single gag that was mildly amusing; a spoof of the Nike commercial that was on TV back in '01, which of course doesn't seem funny now, when they're not sending that commercial. Pretty much all of the movie spoofs in the film don't work, they mostly seem forced, and very weak. I guess you could basically sum up my opinion of this ""film"" by quoting the very words my father said when he saw the first few minutes of the first Scary Movie; ""All that sex and violence... what's the point? Really, it's not even funny, it's just offensive and disgusting."" I don't really recommend this to anybody, except, of course, if there actually exists anyone who are *that* big fans of the Wayans brothers, that they actually could sit through this badly edited and terribly unfunny mess. 1/10",2004
3,"I actually enjoyed the first Scary Movie, I gave it 7 out of 10. But Scary Movie 2 is absolutely horrible. I don't mind gross out humor if it's funny, but here, it's not, it's just plain stupid. I do have some respect for the Wayans Brothers (and the endless list of other writers involved) for at least trying to parody different movies this time around, instead of sticking to the same ones as the first (although a few of the same jokes do show up again here). Unfortunately, they just couldn't pull it off. The teen slasher movies from the original were easier to parody, I think, because they're just really horrible to begin with and very easy to make fun of. People would have laughed no matter what. It seems like they were expecting the same thing with the second movie. However, most of the movies they choose to parody are a little more on the serious side, and therefore, are more difficult to make fun of. Not that it couldn't be done, but the writers would have to put more work into it. They didn't. All but a few of the jokes fall flat, and are more likely to inspire blank stares, not laughter. There are a few really funny jokes, but not nearly as many as the original Scary Movie, and not nearly enough to fill an entire movie.",2001

The attraction is instant and they spend a romantic evening cavorting around New York City together.  At the end of the evening John wants to see her again, but Sara decides that if it is fate that they should be together, they will find each other again.

Likewise, she makes him write his number on a banknote, which she promptly spends, telling him that if fate decrees it, the note will find its way back to her.

9,"Magic happens, if you let it; and sometimes even fate or destiny-- or whatever you want to call it-- steps in to lend a hand.  But when it concerns love, and finding that special person you're going to spend the rest of your life with, should you risk tempting fate with a test of that love or what is seemingly meant to be, or should you just follow your apparent destiny and embrace it?  Such are the questions two people must face and answer in the romantic comedy/drama `Serendipity,' directed by Peter Chelsom.  Jonathan Trager (John Cusack) is shopping for a gift for his girlfriend, and Sara Thomas (Kate Beckinsale) is looking for something for her boyfriend when they reach for the same pair of gloves on a rack at Bloomingdales.  And the wheels of fate are quickly turning.  Or are they? Jonathan and Sara proceed to spend the next few hours together, including a romantic interlude skating in New York's Central Park, and there are definite sparks flying between them.  For Jonathan, it's a significant emotional experience, and he realizes something has happened, that something has changed in his life; Sara feels the same, but being a true believer in destiny, she needs a sign that this is meant to be before she'll consider pursuing whatever it is that's just happened between them.  So she puts it to the test.  And for Jonathan, knowing only that her name is Sara, it's the beginning of an odyssey-- a quest-- to find true love with the woman he already knows in his heart of hearts that he wants to share his life with. For Sara, it's the beginning of a search for love, and for that one special person she knows is destined to be her soul mate forever.  They both find, however, that the path to pure love is filled with every obstacle the known universe could possibly place in their way.  And is the journey worth it?

9,"The first time I've seen this movie, I knew I'd add it to my ""classics"", and here it is. Kate Beckinsale shows her talent -finally- within the movie by blending right into the act of John Cusack. Since I'm in love with these kind of movie scripts, the movie got me in its clasp as I've heard Armstrong's deep voice in the beginning. As the movie starts, the movie's philosophy starts to reveals itself through a pair of black Kashmir gloves. The fact that love will find a way through it all is buzzing all around the movie and makes you feel warmer even though it's winter and snowing. The ice skating section and the ending section on the same ""floor"" are wondrous moments which any people would like to live - which makes the movie closer to the audience. The thought of someone ""right around the corner"" waiting for you is all around the movie and makes you feel like go out and find ""them"". A really cute story with a good sense of humor.

8,"The plot premise, in a particularly streamlined nutshell:  In holiday-season Manhattan, Sara Thomas (Kate Beckinsale) and Jonathan Trager (John Cusack) meet cute and, although they both have Significant Others, they end up spending a charming and romantic evening on the town (including coffee and dessert at the aptly-named Serendipity III restaurant).  Despite their obvious chemistry, Sara insists on leaving their future up to fate (she turns out to be a therapist, so you'd think she'd know better, but more on that momentarily), whereupon they get separated in the Waldorf=Astoria. Years later, Sara and Jon are both engaged to other people, but can't stop thinking about one another, so they each take a last stab at finding each other again before their respective nuptials.  Knowing what a big John Cusack fan I am, a friend of mine recommended I rent SERENDIPITY. Between a parade of people phoning us and our own busy schedules, however, I had almost as much trouble getting to finally sit down and watch the DVD from start to finish as Jon and Sara did trying to get back together in the film itself!  But it was worth the effort:  even though I was growling at Sara under my breath for being so stupid as to leave their budding romance up to fate instead of running off with Jon when she had the chance (and was Sara so new to NYC that it never occurred to her that other people might take Jon's elevator in the Waldorf=Astoria during their decisive elevator race? Do fate and common sense have to be mutually exclusive?), I found Cusack and Beckinsale so endearing and so full of romantic chemistry (and they both looked yummy, I might add) that I found myself forgiving a lot and rooting for them to get back together.  Marc Klein's script is so chock-full of funny and frustrating near-misses that at times I found SERENDIPITY as suspenseful as a Hitchcock film! :-)  NYC and San Francisco locations are used wonderfully (I was pleased to see that although the second floor of Serendipity III as shown in the film was quiet enough for Sara and Jon to hear each other talk, it was still as crowded as it usually is on a holiday week! :-).  Cusack and Beckinsale are surrounded by a delightful supporting cast, too, particularly Jeremy Piven and Molly Shannon as their respective best friends and the scene-stealing Eugene Levy as an officious, self-serving Bloomingdale's salesman.  I also found it refreshing that the filmmakers didn't take the obvious route of making the leads' current Significant Others so horrible that you can't imagine what attracted Our Heroes to these creeps in the first place (that sort of thing always makes me lose respect for both the protagonist *and* the screenwriter).  Bridget Moynihan and John Corbett (did the casting directors just stroll on over to the set of SEX AND THE CITY one day and say ""Who's free to make a movie?"" :-) were appealing enough that I could understand what Cusack and Beckinsale saw in them, yet they were just self-absorbed enough and not-quite-on-our-heroes'-wavelength enough that I didn't feel bad when they got dumped. If romantic whimsy is your bag, give SERENDIPITY a try.",2004

The best love stories arent so much about the story as they are about what we wish romance in our lives was.Instantaneous...Tender...Magical...Hearts all a flutter.If you like good chemistry between the likeable Cusack and Beckinsale in a magical setting...prepare to be touched.I was.This is by far one of my favorite love stories,only slightly behind "" Somewhere in Time "" .If you expect realism dont bother -but if you want what love SHOULD be...hypnotic,mesmerizing,a heart awash a sea of tenderness...then get ready to enjoy yourself.May you all find your true love as well....",2004
10,"This is the ideal romantic film, brilliantly directed by Peter Chelsom (why does he not make more films?) and perfectly cast with John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale. Jeremy Given gave a wonderful performance as Cusack's friend, which greatly helps the film work. And special mention must be made of a hilarious cameo role played by Eugene Levy as the salesman one most dreads meeting at Bloomingdales in New York. (His hysterical 'don't step behind the counter!' is what we have all encountered so often with neurotic sales people. Of course, one 'understands', while laughing uncontrollably at them.) This film is funny, warm, life-affirming, ironical, strange, disturbing, comforting, and licks your face like a puppy. Its theme is the invisible tapestry and connecting threads of fate which lie behind the events of the visible world, especially as they relate to True Love. In other words, 'serendipity', or fortunate chance. Cusack and Beckinsale find each other, are eternally meant for each other, lose each other, and - well, I don't want to spoil things, - but let us say, search for each other for years, with results to be discovered by the viewer. It is all so charming and just right that rather than find another romantic film, one might just as well watch this one again over and over, with a steadily increasing and delighted smile. Above all, it is Cusack who makes this, as he is the ideal romantic male lead for such charming and elfish fare. His slightly pixie-like looks are just quirky enough, not too much to make him look truly odd, but enough to mark him on the brow as 'an innocent at large' who can have these adventures and really mean them.",2007

This stupid plot has been used too many times, and the only time it has had success is in Sleepless in Seattle. Has anyone realize what self-centred jerks these people are? They dump their perfectly nice fiancés practically at the altar, and at the altar in some cases to find someone they met for one evening about 5 years ago.

OK--- that might fly, given the whole ""soul mate"" destiny motif of the movie. But then he becomes engaged to a sweet, attractive woman who obviously loves him very much, and even the night before his wedding to this innocent and utterly charming lady he STILL chooses to chase after this rather frigteningly stubborn memory he has of the English girl.

Being a romantic I am almost obligated to be riveted. My favorite scene is where Cusack is on the ground and snow starts falling. The finale is almost too sweet, but most deserving. This is not one of Cusack's deeper roles, but who in the hell could not be smitten by Beckinsale. Notable support is provided by Jeremy Piven and Molly Shannon. John Corbett plays the worst role I've ever seen him in. On the other hand Eugene Levy is quirky and funny. Watch this with your soul mate.",2002

At first my friend introduced me to the show and it became our favorite show, she has every episode taped and believe me she protects them with her life, but in the last few seasons the show has become less about the Drover's Girls running a cattle station than a few love triangles/ pentagons. Although i still love McLeod's they (Writters) have gone off the track a little. After the deaths of some characters, and the everlasting on/off relationships between too many characters we were becoming less and less happy with where the show was headed.

I think that we are finally seeing the original Mcleods in its glory, and I'm liking what i see.",2006
10,McLeod's Daughters is a great TV series.,2006
10,I loved this serial with everything contains from events to actions to human relations to the hope of tomorrow no matter how hard is the time been but yet we have to work & survive ........,2006
9,"OK, I'm a man that sometimes watches female-centric programming. Mostly because I like to understand the opposite sex, which I love. And, the women on this show are very attractive. But, like most hetero men, don't always understand what's in their heads. So, I thought I could learn a few things while watching this series from down under. Understandably, and based on all the other feedback from this series, it has been given high marks for story, character development, setting, landscape, actor performance, and everything else. All well-deserved. However, I was especially surprised and amazed at a male-centric episode in Season 5, episode 31, titled ""Body and Soul"" near the end of the season. I want to recognize Fin Edquist as the writer (I looked it up on IMDb.com) It was the best episode I had seen so far. I won't spoil it, but it was just amazing to see what the men of the story could do. They came through for their women, and brothers, and best friends in spades. Just the kind of heart wrenching story even a guy can appreciate. Keep it coming.",2010
9,"My wife and I saw some of the re-runs on TV, and quickly became addicted to the show. Other TV favorites include Westwing, House and The Sopranos ... each different from each other, but highly recommended.",2009
10,"As a guy, i am not a fan of TV shows aimed at a women's audience, which i guess McLeod's Daughters is, but when i first watched this show a few years back, i found it to be great and entertaining. Apart from the annoying pop soundtrack, this is a brilliant show, it is well acted and it seems to be believable and realistic up until around season seven anyway. Claire and Tess were great as the two original McLeod's sisters, and with the arrival or new characters and the departure of the original characters. Like Home and Away and Packed to the Rafters, McLeod's Daughters is another great show to come for down under. I would recommend this to anyone who likes Australian television.",2010
10,"This is honestly one of the most brilliant and beautiful shows that I have ever had the absolute pleasure to watch. It is one of those shows that you can easily sit down and marathon through an entire disc or two in one sitting. The characters are really well fleshed out as this is more of a character driven show. The countryside setting isn't always my favorite but for Mcleod's I make an exception as Drover's run is now one of my favorite television show settings. The scenery is always breath-taking and the dialog is really intelligent as the conversation flows naturally. When disaster strikes it hurts the viewer to watch their favorite characters pass on, especially since the actors and actresses have hardly been on anything else it makes it all the more realistic when they depart (which is a shame because they are really talented actresses). The Australian landscape is hauntingly beautiful and adds to the seductive factor of the show. The characters leave too soon. The new characters (although they do take a bit of getting used to) end up stealing the show, especially Regan, Kate and Moira. The soundtrack is from an Australian singer- Rebecca Lavelle- and sometimes the actors of the show, such as Michala Banas, record their own songs for the show. The show is definitely one not to miss and if I wasn't going to spoil anything for you I would honestly chat with you for 10 hours straight on the entire series. An extremely underrated series please give it a watch.",2014
10,"Unfortunately the show ended long ago and I had to watch on Netflix. I have now seen every episode and would like to applaud the actors-each and every one of them. Out of all the films I've watched over the years I think these actors built strong characters for the roles they played. I was lucky to watch one right after the other and really got attached to these characters. Whatever emotions they were going through they did them so well that we were right there with them. I think one of the things I like the most was the way the characters were written.I like the fact that they didn't keep their hair ""perfect"", they were comfortable in their choice of clothing. I just can't tell you how much I enjoyed this series. I'm very sorry to know that season 8 was the last, I think it could have gone on for a lot longer without dulling our interest. Again, congratulations to each of the actors,in my humble opinion you did a fantastic job...now I love you all....and wish you nothing but success in your professional lives as well as your personal lives.",2014
5,"Season 1-3 was brilliant, I find that with Intl series the cast leaves and changes the character dynamics. Seldom do I see those actors go on to bigger and better & it really does a disservice to the audience when characters are written based on their relationships on screen. Season 4 brought on many new characters to fill the hole of Clair, Meg and Becky. None seemed to hit the mark. The character of Stevie is harsh almost to the point of uncomfortable to watch the actor, and the character of Kate has no personality and no presence on the screen. Kane was a shocking addition, he killed his flock of sheep because he was too lazy to treat the illness which was over the top. I could barely watch the show following the slaughter. I was more surprised at the characters response to this mass killing than the character Kane. I don't know if perhaps the writing staff changed from 4 on. The only salvation is Jodi, Tess and Dave as well as Harry & Alex. Those actors bring the scenes to life with wonderfully written personalities & acting, I do hope it get better!",2013
4,"Aside from the variation created by the setting, McLeod's daughters provides little more than a trite, caricatured image of rural Australia. With uninspiring lead performances and plot lines that belong on a daytime soap, this series will impress only ardent feminists with a romantic perception of outback life. ",2011
10,"The year is 1939. The Spanish Civil War is nearing its bloody end. Ten year old Carlos, the orphaned son of a slain Republican, is left by his tutor at an isolated orphanage for boys. The school is destitute, barely able to provide enough food for the children, but headmistress Carmen and Dr. Casares do the best they can. Carlos accepts his fate bravely, but there are still school bullies to contend with, an unexploded bomb sitting in the courtyard as a constant reminder of the war which still rages, and an abusive caretaker named Jacinto who has his own secret agenda. As if that were not enough, a ghost begins stalking Carlos, the ghost of a boy named Santi whose demise is shrouded in mystery and who solemnly warns Carlos that many will soon die. As the war begins closing in on the orphanage, violence erupts within and Santi's prediction comes sadly true. But the worst has not yet happened. The abandoned boys must band together if they hope to survive, and the dead will aid their cause if they are to be avenged.",2005
10,THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE (El Espinazo del Diablo) ,2005
8,"THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE is a Spanish language supernatural thriller.  It consists of a haunted school for orphaned boys.  Now, in an American film that would be all you get, a ghost running around scaring the young inhabitants of the gloomy building.  That's it, and it would not be scary at all.  It is to the credit that the makers of THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE present the actual ghost as the least frightening aspect of the film; he becomes, in fact, the moral center of a deeply complex story.",2003
10,"Great care has been taken with the art direction. You are immediately transported to 1939, with Franco's army about to descend on the Spanish countryside. Even the crumbling buildings of the boys' school the characters inhabit play a role. The actors are superb, and the child actors give award-worthy performances.",2005

8,"I'm a massive fan of the horror genre, but I don't like ghost stories. To me, ghost stories are a poor manifestation of the genre. It's not the idea of ghosts that's the problem, it's the way the stories are presented; often dull, slow moving and uninteresting, and those are things that do not make a good movie. However, there is an exception to every rule; and this film is the case with that one. The Devil's Backbone is a mesmerising and inventive addition to the ghost story tradition. The film moves slowly, but that is a definite advantage to it. The slow pace allows us to get to know, and even care for the characters before the horror starts, and this makes the horror all the more potent when it does start. The Devil's Backbone has been touted as 'the Spanish Sixth Sense', and although this is unfair as this is hardly a bad film; I can see where that notion is coming from. The main difference between the two, however, and the reason why this film works and Shyamalan's doesn't is that the parts between the horror here aren't boring, are well acted and serve a purpose in that they allow us to get to know the characters; Shyamalan got too caught up in trying to make his twist work and the drama in-between caught the brunt of that, rendering the film boring.",2004
5,"Dull ghost story with half-hearted commentary on the Spanish Civil War. The whole thing seems to exist to prop up a few nifty special effects and a vague sense of atmosphere. I struggled to maintain interest... the characters are bland, the scares entirely absent (unless you have a weak stomach for mildly gory bits), the story feels slapped together from fragments of ideas. There's a reveal that I suppose is meant to be a surprise twist, but it's pretty obvious from the first act. It's just really hard to care about what's going on, and there's not much going on anyway. Carlos approaches the ghost and then gets scared and runs away. Creepy Eli Roth-looking dude does something nasty. Repeat, repeat, repeat. While the craftsmanship is somewhat impressive, it's an empty experience, free of passion, wisdom or thrills.",2012
1,"From the writer-director of HELLBOY and MIMIC, what else can I say?",2004
6,"It looks like Guillermo del Toro will be one of the busiest directors around in the coming few years. IMDb tells us that he has one film in post-production and other five booked in different preparation phases, and all this until 2011. This is more than all films he has done until now, and certainly much of this busy schedule is due to his so very different film 'Pan's Labyrinth'.",2008
6,"The style and atmosphere are palpable in this intriguing suspense film. The best parts are the scenes between the children, which recalls the awe and joy of youth seen in such films as Stand By Me and The Outsiders.  The story is simple and beautiful, and the performances are generally strong.",2002
7,At its most basic this is a ghost story set in a remote school/orphanage for boys during the Spanish Civil War.,2009
6,"Was rather disappointed, expected something the likes of ""The Others"" or ""Les Rivieres Pourpres"" but nothing in this movie was very horrific, or fantastic for that matter. The story seemed very promising at the beginning, but was a let-down in the end because it gave hopes for a much better unveiling and disclosure. Not quite sure about the title either, or the coincidence of the bomb that never went off. I guess the worst thing about ""El Espinazo Del Diablo"" is that it has no idea of its potential. SO many intriguing things, the lady with the missing leg, the mute kid, the gold, the actual children with deformed, so called ""devil's"" spines, the doctor seeing ghosts (a rather disturbing scene where he drinks a glass of liquid that's used to preserve the deformed-spine children), so much stuff going on yet NOTHING is executed to the end. Weird, the dying Casares, the old wise doctor, says the exact same thing, about never finishing something to the end. He doesn't even die properly, he sticks around as a ghost.",2005
10,"The Devil's Backbone may just be the finest ghost story ever put on film. No need for a twist ending or Hollywood shocks here, this is intelligent, thoughtful, imaginative film-making at its best. Guillermo del Toro is one of the most talented directors working today and this is the best film he's made so far. Seeing this movie makes The Others and The Sixth Sense look gimmicky and weak. Set during an orphanage during the Spanish Civil War we are treated to wonderful performances by the kids and adults, a very cool and creepy ghost (who always appears to be underwater), and a nice dash of action. All and all this is horror film-making at it's best, del Toro is truly a master as evidenced by this and his debut film Cronos.",2004
3,"The Devils Backbone is in my opinion a very dull and boring movie and is not scary enough to be classed as horror. The story did nothing for me and was very bland, just the simple ghost who died a tragic death wanting revenge on the one(s) responsible. However there are many questions that the film leaves unanswered such as ""What is a ghost?"" and a suggested answer ""a tragedy doomed to repeat itself?"" These can leave interesting thoughts and can keep you watching the film in order to come up with an answer.",2013
4,"I have to certainly ask myself what the other people saw in this film.  To me, this film suffers from a lack of interesting plot, laughable interaction amongst the characters and a mediocre and conventional approach to a ghost story.  To me, there was absolutely nothing interesting or ""frightening"" about the ghost and the 'ambiance' was typical fare.  The story concerns a child who is left at an orphanage in the middle of the desert in Spain during the Spanish Civil War and instead of analyzing his soul, which one would hope would happen, considering this is a foreign movie, we are merely given cliched storylines like ""the ghost is here for a reason,"" or ""there's a ghost in this building,"" and its really all empty.  Nowhere do we get to understand the nature of the inner dimensions of the characters.  There is the typical mean kid bully, the nice teacher and then the sexual young man who is having sex with the older matriarch in one of the most brainless events in the film.  Most of the effects were done with a computer and that takes away any imagination.  The war planes flying above, the explosion in the rectory and even the ghost itself were ""enhanced"" with digital imaging and it further ruins this attempt at life so we are basically left with a modicum of interest.  What is lacking is something inherently interesting, or movable, so there is a ghost, so what?   What does he mean to us?  By the end, we are numbed by the excessive and irrelevant use of violence from one of the characters.  It all fails in the end when this becomes just another good vs bad soap opera in the world film.  The only commendable part was the beginning and the end, where the teacher is contemplating the nature of what a ghost is, other than that, this is blantantly unintelligent.  Grade D-",2002
1,"I'm sorry, I like good films. I like good scary, horror films with a bit more than just horror, something to say. Gimme The Wicker Man, or Alien, or even The Shining, Blair Witch Project or Eden Lake, but don't give me this rubbish, this is contrived, undeveloped, infantile nonsense. NONSENSE! And it isn't even scary. Watch it, and just have a think about all the different elements of the film, and how little they add up to. I'm not even that smart but it's so glaringly obvious it's almost embarrassing. So what if it's about the Spanish Civil War! It says NOTHING about the Spanish Civil War! Or anything else. This guy needs to give up making films and make cardigans instead, I'm sure he'd do a better job. I can't even stand thinking about his film making style, it's painfully bad. I respect everyone who goes a long way to make their vision a reality, but this only proves to me that said particular director is the product of a very naive, crowded and hyped up bandwagon of arty foreign horror nonsense film fans merrily giving up their money and time to elevate him to the inflated and undeserved status he has. Don't fall for it! Demand more! RAAAAAHHHHH! Sigh.",2009
3,"I have no idea why this movie received so positive notes. This is a movie about generally nothing, boring as only very few I saw in last few years. Do not expect anything you did not see in previously seen horrors. Its not even a horror, its some kind of a tale, but well, there is not even 5 % of this spectacular ""shining"" in it, shining that some horrors carry inside. There is no action, no twist, you watch it and you yawn, nothing more. Plus there is some leftist propaganda. Thanks God much much less than in Pan's Labyrinth but still... Save yourself 2 hrs and skip it, believe me.",2010

3,This was one of the most unpleasant movies I have ever seen. Adults killing children - and children killing adults. People drinking the alcohol out of jars with preserved fetuses.

9,"If you think piano teacher Erika Kohut (Isabelle Huppert) in Michael Haneke's film ""LA PIANISTE"" is the ultimate degree in the personification of derangement, perversion and darkness, I've got news for you: the piano teacher in Elfriede Jellinek's novel ""LA PIANISTE"" (on which the film was based) is twice as ""repulsive"", ""disgusting"", ""deranged"" and even more fascinating -- though there can't be words enough to translate the level of artistic proficiency that Isabelle Huppert has reached here, above all other mortal actresses in activity today. And who else could have played this character with such emotional power, complete with the best piano playing/dubbing an actor could deliver?",2003
9,"To be honest I had to go have a stiff drink after this film; I felt drained and my shoulders were knotted. I also had to talk the whole thing out with the friend I saw it with for a good half hour. Whatever else this movie is, it's not dull - you have to have respect for anything that produces such a visceral reaction, even if you couldn't claim to have 'enjoyed' the experience. (Anyone else I've talked to who's seen it has responded in much the same way.)",2002
9,"I saw this film at the 2001 Toronto International Film Festival. La Pianiste reinforces the ""Austrians=grim"" thesis I'm formulating. Isabelle Huppert won a well-deserved Best Actress award at Cannes for her portrayal of a woman who, in her efforts to attain the artistic ideal, loses her humanity. Trapped by her talent, she suppresses her emotions and her sexuality until they can only be expressed in twisted and terrifying ways. When a younger student falls in love with her, our hopes rise, but are soon dashed by the realization that she cannot experience love the way others can. It is too late for her, and the film's final 30 harrowing minutes are, tellingly, devoid of the beautiful music that carried the first 90 minutes. The message seems to be that the music itself is not enough without the life and beauty it's describing.",2002
9,"As with all Haneke films, make your own decision--don't be swayed by what you read and if you are interested in someone using the medium of film for their own unique ends, see it yourself.  Isabelle Huppert is stunning in this film--combined with Haneke, these two never pull their punches. Haneke reels us in with the lure of golden boy,  Benoit Magimel, but this is an anti-romance as much as Funny Games was an anti-thriller.  You'll have to force yourself to watch much of it and the catharsis is much more in the range of sustained anxiety than any kind of emotional release but it's incredibly nervy and thought provoking; Haneke continues to hold up a mirror to how desensitised Western civilization is or has become.  People may turn their noses up at this but it's only taking what Solondz did in Happiness a few steps further.  While grounded in reality, much of what Erika (Huppert) does can be viewed as emotional metaphor.  I'm not recommending it but I wouldn't dissuade you either...it definitely divides people but given it's largely about repression--that's no surprise.",2002
8,"Isabelle Huppert must be one of the greatest actresses of her or any other generation. ""La Pianiste"" truly confirms it. As if that wasn't enough, Annie Girardot plays her mother and Annie Girardot is one of the greatest actresses of her or any other generation. So, as you may well imagine, those pieces of casting are worth the horror we're put through. Isabelle and Annie play characters we've never seen before on the screen. A mother and daughter yes but with such virulent fearlessness that sometimes I was unable even to blink or to breath. Personally, I don't believe in the director's intentions, I don't believe they (the intentions that is) go beyond the shocking anecdote and the ending made me scream with frustration but I was riveted by the story written in the face of the sensational Huppert and the fierceness of Girardot's strength. I highly recommend it to cinema lovers anywhere and to the collectors of great performances like me, you can't afford to miss ""La Pianiste""",2009
8,"In the first twenty minutes we are swept away by several powerfully portrayed emotions: a suffocating and overbearing mother has a violent argument with her live-in 40yr old daughter; a piano teacher (and professor of music)'s love for her pupils expressed in unswerving critical appraisal; the joy that music can inspire both in the listener and the performer. Within this short space of time our senses have been assaulted convincingly with very real characters. We are also swept away by powerfully performed music and shown the difference between great and mediocre performance with a lot of attention to nuance. Such material alone would have been the basis for an outstanding film of widespread appeal. But the trend in French cinema being what it is, it goes deeper, exploring the repressed sexuality of the teacher, the expression of sexual freedom and subsequent breakdown within a context of passionate attraction, and the inevitable cycle of real abuse. We are drawn to her suffering and, at least initially, wonder how much suffering may be related to the accomplishment of genius, particularly in the composers she admires. The Piano Teacher contains graphic dialogue and depictions of sex and brutality in scenes that some people might rather not watch. The scenes are essential to the dilemmas which the film seeks to raise and so can hardly be called gratuitous. A great film it may be, but mainstream viewing it is not.",2001
8,"Erika Kohut is a woman with deep sexual problems. At the start of the film, we see her arriving home late. When her older mother protests, Erika goes into a frenzy, attacking the older woman without pity. Erika, as it turns out, is a musical teacher of a certain renown in the conservatory where she teaches. When we next see her, she is the model of composure, but she shows a cruel side in the way she attacks a young male student because she feels he is wasting his time, and hers. The same goes for the insecure Anna, a talented girl who Erika hates, maybe because she sees in the young woman a promise that she is not willing to promote.",2006
10,"The only director who really matters right now is Michael Haneke.  The 60-ish Austrian is only just now becoming known to American audiences (despite having been making films for a decade), because in this age of false freedom and faux radicalization, he's the real thing: a genuine free thinker and radical.",2002

Otherwise, stand clear, for this is just a portrait of a really, really sick person that will leave a hole in your soul.  Yes, we see how controlling the piano teacher's mother can be and so get some inkling of the roots of her depravity, but we know nothing of the teacher's history.  So it's not a study of how someone becomes sado-masochistic which might have made this a more interesting psychological study.  ",2003
1,A Really Mixed Up Movie. Mixed up? Yes. It contains a lot of classical piano playing and a great deal of sexual deviation. If you like classical piano you will hate the deviant sex. If you enjoy deviant sex the piano playing will bore you.,2006

I'm not telling you to steer away from the film, but be aware that what you're about to see is some disturbing material.  Definitely not a pleasing film to watch, but nothing is put on screen strictly for shock value.  But I must admit, when I watched the film for a second time, I had to skip to the next chapter when the ""razor blade scene"" came up.  ",2003

3,"I do not fail to recognize Haneke's above-average film-making skills. For example, I appreciate his lingering on unremarkable-natural-day-lighted settings as a powerful way to force a strong sense of realism. However, regarding the content of this film, I am very sad to see that in the 21st century there is still an urge to pathologize domination-submission relations or feelings (and/or BDSM practices). The problem that the main character has with her mother is unbelievably topical as is the alienation and uncomprehension felt by Walter (I don't mean the frustration of a lover which is not loved back in the same way, which is understandable; I mean that he looks upon her as if she were crazy, or as if he was a monk, come on!). I mean D/s is not something new in the world and I think it is rather silly to treat the subject as if it were something ""freakish"" or pathological; it isn't. In general, films dealing with this subject are really lagging behind the times.",2007
1,"Overlong scenes and some stupid scriptwriting makes this rather tedious. I think it's supposed to be a portrait of madness, but it takes the rather dated Freudian sexist way there. This film doesn't like women much, perhaps resembling it's maker and his influences.",2005
8,"I'm a fan of Meg Ryan and think that she's one of the best there is in Hollywood right now. Yet, I believe that it was HUGH JACKMAN who stole the show in this movie. He is so charming and charismatic that you can hardly resist falling head over heels for him! Leopold is a duke from the 18th century who mistakenly lands up in the 21st century one day...and is obviously bewildered with everything he sees. He stays with the man who got him there at the first place, Stuart,Kate's (Meg Ryan) ex-boyfriend. Predictably, Leopold falls in love with Kate and she retaliates. Yet, he has to go back where he came from, and that poses a problem for their relationship. It's a cute movie, yet, I couldn't agree with the ending, though it was predictable. I just couldn't see eye to eye with the reasoning they gave us for the step Kate took. Okay movie...great if you have nothing else to do and like chick-flicks. That's exactly the reason I watched it. I liked it..but I've seen better by Meg Ryan.",2005
8,"Honestly, my wife rented this and I wasn't planning on watching - but the luscious cinematography and some interesting writing drew me in.  Hugh Jackman sealed the deal with his totally straight portrayal - this guy's earning power can only go up!  Looking for some fluff and a laugh? It's better than most of the romantic comedy crap out there.  Not a waste of time if you are in the mood to have something wash over you.",2002

7,"This movie wouldn't really be anything to write home about. You could call it science fiction because it's about time travel, but any serious science fiction buff would know better. But, there's something absolutely extraordinary about this movie that has me watching it again and again. I wasn't a big Hugh Jackman fan when I watched this movie. I suppose I'm still not. I'm too old for that kind of thing, but the character Leopold has a stillness, a quality of listening and putting other people (man or woman) first. He demonstrates an etiquette that is not at all stiff, that is less about precise forms and rules than about a genuine care for other people. I go back and watch Kate and Leopold when I wish I knew somebody who cared that much for me.",2006

10,I must admit the characters in Kate & Leopold were superb.! Meg Ryan was great and Hugh Jackman .... incredible.  This is the kind of movie you'd skip a night out in town on a saturday night to watch. This is definitely for the women out there who still believe in true romance. I'm one of them ! I really don't mind watching Hugh Jackman in more comedy romances. Leopold will sweep you off your feet and steal your heart away.!,2003
5,"I was disappointed upon seeing this movie. I expected something different than what I actually got. The premise is brilliant, but the result is poor. I mean, overlooking the time travel thing - it wasn't badly thought out actually - I found myself thinking that Kate and Leopold really didn't have that much chemistry. They fell in love way too suddenly to make it believable. However, Hugh Jackman pulls this film through. He made it enjoyable to watch, especially in the scenes where his character is teaching Kate's brother about women (ironic though, since he's never been in love before). I was sorely disappointed by Meg Ryan, though. This movie is good to pass time, it's OK entertainment, but it lacks the emotional appeal and chemistry of so many other romantic comedies out there.",2007
10,"This movie kind of reminds me of Hayford Peirce's ""Napoleon Disentimed,"" when a con-man playing Napoleon invents champagne - this for me connects where there is a plausible yet apocryphal reference to Hugh Jackman's character inventing a modern-day convenience (Leopold - but a member of royalty did perform a type of invention; speaking under correction, but I think Philip II of Spain created the precursor to the current thermometer used nowadays)! The further irony was that Leopold was discovered by another would-be inventor, played to disarming effect by Liev Schreiber - which is a far cry from Liev's chilling performance in the remake of ""The Manchurian Candidate"" - and he is also the benighted ex-lover of Meg Ryan (Kate).",2006

9,"I can understand why people would be put off by a movie like Kate & Leopold, even if only because it's a little TOO cute. Consider, for example, the scene early in the film, just after Stuart (Liev Schreiber) has accidentally brought Leopold (in a wonderful performance by Hugh Jackman) to the present day, and Kate (Meg Ryan) sticks her head in the window to see what's going on. When Meg Ryan is kneeling down and looking in the window in this scene, she is probably more adorable than I've ever seen her in any other movie, and she is without a doubt one of the most adorable actors working in Hollywood today.

I advise everybody watch it (for male it is a great manual about how to escort a lady; for ladies - the level of standards they should demand from men). No kidding it is fantastic.

5,"While my wife and I enjoyed watching this film (except for the wretched haircut on Meg Ryan), I was amazed that the obvious historical anachronisms got past the writers and editors of this film. I was even more amazed that none of the comments on the film have pointed them out. For example, Leopold is supposed to be plucked out of 1876 New York to the modern day city. But in one scene, he shows more than superficial knowledge of the opera La Boheme, which was not composed until 1893. Further, he sings and teaches the songs from Pirates of Penzance, which had its world premiere in 1879. And the movie opens with the celebration of the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge (then called the Great East River Bridge) which was not completed until 1883. Didn't anyone check these dates and see that they were just out of whack with 1876?",2004

10,"It's very rare, but occasionally a film comes along that plays out so realistically that it doesn't even seem like you're watching a movie, but participating-- albeit as an observer-- in this particular drama of life that is unfolding around you.  And so it is with `Monster's Ball,' a riveting film, directed by Marc Forster, that is so real it transcends entertainment and becomes a voyeuristic experience that leaves you with the sense that you've been through everything that's happened yourself.  It's a thought provoking examination of relationships and perspectives, including the ingrained, subjective attitudes-- especially prejudices-- that have such a profound and lasting affect on our lives, as well as the lives of those around us.  It's a film that says so much about the way we respond to one another, as well as certain situations, and why; in short, it's about the world that we, as a society, have created and must live in together-- right or wrong, good or bad, black or white.  And at the heart of the story is a message that rings through loud and true; a perception that we can do better-- and must-- if we are to survive as a civilized, dignified and progressive species.  In the final analysis, we are, all of us, members of the family of Man; and it's time we realize and acknowledge it.",2002

And to make things ""worse"", it's controversial as well because the story isn't exactly about a family living together happy with more money than there is water in the sea.

10,"When I first heard that Halle Berry was getting publicity over a film called ""Monster's Ball"", a movie I had never even heard of, I was a little skeptical. I mean, come on, this is HALLE BERRY. The star of ""B.A.P.S."". The actress who said ""You know what happens to a toad when it gets hit by lightning? The same thing as what happens to everyone else,"" in ""X-Men"". I was not convinced. Then I saw the movie and my jaw dropped. Who knew Berry had this in her? A performance of emotion, range, and power, Berry's Leticia Musgrove redefined the actress' career and brought new meaning to the phrase ""emotionally distraught"". The film's plot, while fundamentally simple, hides layers of emotion and deep character analysis. Billy Bob Thorton is as strong as he's ever been as Hank Grotowski, a selfish and racist prison guard who lives with his vicious and hateful father, Buck (Peter Boyle), and his sweet and utterly decent son Sonny (Heath Ledger). Hank hates his father, who has ruined his life up to this point in time, and also says he hates his son, in who he sees the character traits he lost so long ago. Halle Berry is a deadbeat African-American mom of an overweight son (Coronji Calhoun) with a husband (Sean Combs) who is on Death Row. Unforseen tragic events bring these seemingly unmatchable people together, and their mutual hurt and sadness climaxes in one of the most powerful and emotional love scenes in film history. A common complaint I have with sex in the movies these days is that it doesn't ever seem to make sense with the story. This sex scene, however, is a perfect evolution of the story and is an extension of the two characters' mutual need to feel something other than grief. ""Make me feel good"" Berry cries in a mix of ecstasy and anguish. In another brilliant moment later in the film, Hank gives oral satisfaction to Leticia, but the moment is not uncomfortable or pointless because it illustrates Hank's devotion to this woman and how he is now wholly devoted to giving everything he has to this other person (""I've never done that before.""). His act of rescuing her is his own redemption. ""Monster's Ball"" is a truly beautiful and effective film about redemption and the importance of our love for other human beings. The final shot, with Hank and Leticia on the front porch of Hank's house with a bowl of ice cream, is one of the most quietly poetic and effective endings I have ever seen, and Hank's final line is a perfect closer to a film about the ultimate redemptive quality of love-""I think we're gonna be alright.""",2003

Halle Berry's intense insecurity mixed with a murky but strong sense of personal pride anchored this film, but Billy-Bob Thornton's brilliance gave it wings. It is incredible to me that he plays such unlikable characters with such pathos, but I am always grateful that he does. He doesn't choose easy stories, and this one is no exception ... a man ugly from the inside but still the most advanced person to come out of his raising. Heath Ledger showed such a weary sadness ... you almost feel glad that he escapes the same cycle, however terrible his method of doing so. I was surprised when the film ended and I felt a sense of hope and not hopelessness. It seemed to be saying that we have a future if we try to forgive and protect each other ... some secrets are about who we have been and will never be again. Forgive.",2006
1,This movie will insult your intelligence. It mocks humanity. It is very poorly written. Why did these famous actors agree to do this? Did they go out together and lose all their money in Vegas and become extremely desperate?,2008
10,"This is a very brave movie.  Not because of the racism or the sex or the execution, but because it trusts its viewers.  It does not insult us by making the characters chatter for hours beating the themes into the ground until even the most simple-minded viewer ""gets"" it.  The screenwriters (like William Faulkner and Hemingway and Welty before them) understand that they won't reach most of the population.  They teach to the top of the class by entrusting the theme to a few well-placed, well-acted lines.  In a culture where few people have ever read a novel, much less a good novel, much less a great novel, this movie is brave enough to be literary.  It challenges the viewer to draw from his or her own emotions and life experiences to meet it half-way.  Most aren't willing to do that.  They take their movies like they take their food, fast and easy.  But for those of us looking for more, this is art.  10/10",2002
9,"I first became interested in this movie because I am a Halle Berry fan. It was not at all what I expected when I first watched it, so I was unsure of it. But I watched it again and now I love this movie and own it on VHS. It is hard hitting and hard to watch in places. But also very tender in a subtle sort of way in others. It confronts all the issues laid out in the movie with gusto. It is what I would call a ""no holds barred"" movie. It follows the lives of two very different people and their families and the people that they meet in everyday life. After a series of unfortunate, and sometimes tragic events these two people's lives become intertwined. In every day life, there are issues of racism, the death penalty, abuse and loneliness for these people. Tragedy strikes the two main characters, Hank and Leticia, in different ways yet the tragedy is similar in that they both lose their sons. The fact that they have this in common brings them together in an ironic twist. Sex also plays a part in how this movie progresses. From signifying the loneliness of a man who has to depend on a prostitute for affection, to the need of two ordinary people to get a respite, even if temporary, from a lot of heartache. The movie pivots on the latter of these sex scenes. It gives Hank and Leticia hope that things may not be so bad from now on. It is a raw, emotional and explicit scene, but it works because it is essential to the plot. After this the movie explores the highs and lows of their relationship. But you want things to work out between them after all that has happened. Can they learn to overcome their personal tragedies? Can they learn to love again? What does the future hold? If you want to know the answers, watch this movie. I would recommend it to anyone who is open minded about the issues dealt with in this movie. In my opinion Halle Berry deserved the Oscar. But Marc Forster and Billy Bob Thornton should have got one also.",2005

Instead of war coverage and serious drama, this has become a ray of hope. Make no mistake, it ain't winning any Oscars. But the slapstick is funny, has great co-stars like Joe Don Baker and Chris Walken. It has a good plotline, a search for his family. It's a lot of laughs and fun for plebes at heart.

I saw this in the theater and thought, ""wow what a funny movie."" But then I caught in on Comedy Central a few years later and lo and behold I was hooked. Good plot, great humor, hot chicks, and even Kid Rock playing his white trash nemesis (it was a real stretch for him :P).

I also enjoy watching this movie with the special feature commentary from David Spade again and again. The hair, the car, the poo, the girl, Kickin Wing, Buffalo Bob: ""It puts the lotion on the skin!, it does what it's told!"" has me laughing in my sleep. I have rewound the carnival scene with G. Thorogood's ""Who do you love"" to the point of wearing out the reverse button. My favorite scene is the shortest scene in the whole movie, when he's hitchhiking and holding that sign (oh my goodness that hysterical with the green stonewashed jeans), the space peanut.... oh i could go on and on, but I have to go watch the movie again....

Adults can enjoy every moment of the movie as well as kids, with some of the jokes going over their heads (I'm yer sister! I'm yer sister!). This is one movie that our family has watched over and over again and it never gets old. The musical score of the movie is exceptional! The music goes hand in hand with the movie scenes and while the movie itself needed no improvement, the music perfected the movie like good wine perfects a good steak.

Not surprisingly, Sandler's production company 'Happy Madison,' which also made ""Deuce Bigelow: Male Gigolo,"" produced ""Joe Dirt."" Predictably, ""Joe Dirt"" (*** out of ****) appeals to the mentality of an 8-year old in its fixation with all kinds of fecal matter, fart jokes , and big-breasted babes. Strictly speaking, guys more than gals will guffaw at the juvenile escapades of our eponymous character. Although scatological humor dominates this picaresque tale about our thirty something protagonist's search for the ungrateful parents who abandoned him at age 8 at the Grand Canyon, David Spade's sympathetic but half- witted hillbilly hero towers memorably above those lowest-common-denominator-jests. Aside from Dennis Miller's hilarious but obnoxious jeers at Joe's appearance and pedigree, ""Joe Dirt"" shuns mean-spirited melodramatics and contents itself with showing how our resilient hero bounces back from more hurts than anybody should have to endure.",2007

Occasionally some people get together and make an unexpectedly good movie and this was one of those time. With a good amount of humor and cuteness about it, and a surprisingly sympathetic performance from the normally acerbic David Spade it was a pretty nice waste of time, like Fifty First Dates was. There was some guttural humor (an atomic *stink*bomb), it was a well layered joke when you think about it, but it was (thankfully) no Farelley brothers piece of... well you know.

I was lucky enough to get into a sneak preview last night, and I was not disappointed. The movie, like the book, has the most hilarious lines and moments, and each of the actors portrayed their characters so well you couldn't imagine anyone else in that part.  Renee Zellweger IS Bridget, there is just no arguing it. No other actress could have pulled off what Renee did in this movie. Hugh Grant makes for an excellent Daniel, who is completely two faced and has a smarmy sort of charm that makes you want him just as badly as Bridget does. Colin Firth is a superb Mark Darcy, but that was a given because the character was practically written with him in mind - as all avid BJD readers know, Mark Darcy's character is a play on the Mr. Darcy Firth portrayed in Pride and Prejudice.",2001

In order for the movie to work for me, it had to capture Bridget's plucky-heroine character and the hilarious-poignant emotions that are in the book.  Needless to say, `Bridget Jones's Diary' the movie worked very, very, very well.  Although Helen Fielding also wrote the screenplay (w/ Richard Curtis, very skilled with romantic comedies) and keeps the laughs coming, this movie could have fallen flat on its face.  But it doesn't because one, the casting is absolutely divine and two, smartly builds on some elements the book downplays.  ",2004

Being given such a thin material to work with, playing a `dreadful cold fish', he has artfully shown Mark Darcy's kindness and charm that gradually wins everyone's heart.  This would be an impossible mission for actors other than Colin Firth.  I enjoy every minute of his performance.  In my opinion, they should give this nice boy more camera times - that's the only complain I have about this movie.  Besides this complain, I have to congratulate the whole production team for successfully creating a movie of such weightless fun, and at the same time being honest and sincere to the human emotions. It is very hard to believe that this movie is Sharon Maguire's first one. I never read the book.  So, you can trust my observation to be totally independent of the book.  If you wish to have some fun and also like to dream a little bit, this is definitely the movie for you. BTW.

Not to mention that ""fat"" Bridget is not that fat at all - the majority of women these days wouldn't look half so good in that bunny suit. For all the glorifying praise Renee got for gaining weight, there really wasn't anything to write home about. Frumpy clothing does not make someone fat. I actually think she looked better in BJD than she did in her wedding pictures. While I love Colin Firth and ""Pride and Prejudice"", I found his character boring and uninspired. I suppose he probably was bored and uninspired, considering this is exactly the type of role Colin keeps getting thrown into.",2005
4,"I thought that after all the good words I'd heard about BJD, it would be a safe-bet rental. I was wrong. This was a first for me; my first DVD in which I had no desire to check out any of the extras on the disk. Indeed, I found myself calculating the remaining time during the last half of the film.",2001
1,Get it? Boy if this isn't the kiss of death to 1000 years of western culture then I don't know my Spengler. What is it with this Zellweger person? Is she a new generation of gremlin?

10,"i absolutely LOVE this movie. Its had me in tears of laughter. Bridget Jones, arguably the funniest film of 2001, I think you'll agree. This is a film for anyone over the age of 15, but honestly I think seeing as I'm not fifteen myself, everyone will most probably love it. But, I'll give you one piece of advice, DO NOT, and I repeat DO NOT watch it with your parents or grandparents because it will lead to utter embarrassment.The Storyline- It's New Year's Day, hung over and still single, Bridget Jones- a 30-something year old journalist girl from London-decides to start a great new life. And in order to do so, she decides to keep a diary. Of which she rights down everything from her calories gained to her instant messaging with Daniel Cleaver (her boss). She makes new years resolutions such as: to stop smoking; make better use of time; and learn to programme video. It is a film like no other, a masterpiece of great storytelling. As for the genre-it is a Romantic Comedy, which is very equally balanced, which on one hand, makes you feel very sorry for Bridget at times, but on the other will leave you laughing uncontrollably. I mean, come on, how many films have you seen with a great storyline, a love triangle, and that can make you laugh till your ribs hurt? Now I think of it, not many!Characters: Mark Darcy, the love of Bridget's life, and Daniel Cleaver, quite funnily enough, also, the love of Bridget's life are sworn enemies. Mark is a very upper-class sophisticated character. Who is sometimes very up himself. Daniel is the complete opposite; he is a very laid back easy-going character. Jude, Sharon and Tom-Bridget's three best friends which give her some of the worst advice you can think of. But they do try to help, Tom-The main character-Bridget is a working class girl, slightly overweight, or so she thinks. She is infatuated with Daniel before Mark comes along.",2006
1,"this is, without a doubt, the biggest pile of putrescent garbage it has ever been my misfortune to watch. i would rather jam spoons under my eyelids than be forced to sit through that ordeal again. Bridget Jones is a brainless tart who sets the women's movement back about 50 years. my boyfriend thought it would be romantic to watch it together. he was wrong. this film reinforces every bad female stereotype there is. the characters were unbelievable and extremely annoying, the acting vapid and fourth rate. i consider it an insult to my backside that it had to suffer the discomfort of prickly cinema seating for the duration of this dross. if Bridget Jones were a real person, i would track her down and beat the crap out of her. if you haven't seen this film, please, PLEASE do yourself a favour and avoid it like the plague.",2006

1,"One word sums up this movie: Idiotic.  British humor can be funny.  `Men Behaving Badly' and `Coupling' are very funny British shows I see occasionally on BBC America. But, for the love of God, this movie is positively not funny.  It also is complete foolishness, not funny foolishness but utter foolishness.  Sleep inducing foolishness.  Most of the characters are unlikable in almost every way.  Bridget is not very intelligent to put it lightly.  Her escapades I assume were supposed to be amusing but were more or less annoying.  Hugh Grant is by far and away my least favorite actor of all time.  If I had known he was in the movie I would most likely have skipped it altogether.  Colin Firth's character was the only character I enjoyed watching.  He at least had some kind of intelligence and depth along with a little mystery and intrigue.",2003
1,What can I say about this movie except it's possibly one of the worst movies of it's type ? I've sat through movies on the Lifetime Channel with my girlfriend that were better than this ( and that's saying a heck of alot bub. ) Avoid this movie like the plague people.,2004

10,Bridget Jone's Diary is of course the book that was made into a movie. This movie was released in 2004 mostly for European countries. Renée Zellweger plays the main character called 'Bridget'. Bridget is in her late 30's and is not married; she is very concerned and starts to keep a diary. Now starts the movie. Colin Firth and Hugh Grant co-star as amiable men that she falls for. Other actor/actresses like Jim Broadbent and Gemma Jones also co-star. I would give this movie a 10/10 for an excellent script. The movie is very humorous and shows different personalities of all the actors. The movie does contain sexual references and swearing so watch out if you are seeing it with younger children. Renee shows how wonderfully she can fake an English accent in this movie as well because of course she is American. This is probably one of the best pieces of works i have seen from Colin Firth as well. The movie must have been good you may think because there was a follow-up. The movie soon spread to America and critics from over here also give it wide remarks. I would recommend this movie too you 100%. Thanks for reading this and have a nice day! Bye,2006

10,"It would be all too easy to dismiss Enemy At The Gates as being an attempt to cash in on Saving Private Ryan's success, but in my opinion, it is a very worthy competitor. In fact, it is a better film. I say that primarily because I am sick to death of Americans using World War II as a basis for films that generally amount to little more than propaganda. Of course, Enemy At The Gates comes off as being somewhat fantastic due to its attempt to balance entertainment with historical fact, and it came as a surprise to me to learn that Sergeant Vassili Zaitsev was a real person (whose sniper rifle is still an exhibit in a Russian museum), but this makes it all the more entertaining to watch.",2001

1,"This movie is so much about Hollywood propagating stereotypes and an ideological agenda and too little about portraying the true History behind the story. The Germans as usual are monsters and child killers and the Russians are controlled by a brutal communist ideology. The movie missed the true historic dimension of the tragedy that Stalingrad was, the horrific losses of life on both sides and how human lives are worth nothing during a war. The part that I found the most untruthful was the killing of the boy by the German sniper. In order for this story to be true we will have to believe that a 12 year old Russian kid in Stalinist Russia was capable of speaking perfect German and Russian to communicate with his enemies and move back and forth between the two sides unless of course both combatants spoke English during the war. So much for Hollywood and historical facts. Chepe (jmek052)",2004

9,"At first glance I must admit I thought ""Oh no!"" not another war movie trying to cash in on the success that Saving Private Ryan had. However when I viewed this film it turned out to be a great surprise in my mind. Its the story of a man brought to fame in a form of propaganda to help the disintegrating Russian forces keep faith. The boy (Law) was obviously talented however nearly lost his own faith when poised against his greatest challenge, the prized German sniper. The story line throughout kept me glued to the screen leading up to a wonderful climax.",2001
1,"When my American friends told me about this Movie I thought I might enjoy it. After 5 minutes I did not know whether to be angry or disgusted. The battle of Stalingrad(Leningrad is modern St. Petersburg up north, Stalingrad is Volgograd in Russia's south) has never before been so knowingly destroyed and revised to demonize and smear the country that won the war in Europe, and helped to fight and defeat Japan before it attacked the US in 1938-39.",2005
1,"I hated this movie. War movies are difficult to pull off as it is, at least historical ones, but this one fails more miserably than any I've seen. There are some okay moments. There's a few good moments between actors, and occasionally you can get the tension of the cat-and-mouse game of the two snipers. However, the rest is terrible. It's all war scenes, with one drinking scene and one sex scene. There's no chemistry between Jude Law and Rachel Weisz, and this is the probably the main reason why the sex scene is so weak and distasteful. It seems a little like a last-ditch attempt to say both ""Look! These characters really do have a relationship! They're having sex!"" as well as ""Look! It really is hard for these characters! They're having sex on a tiny cot!"" Not to mention an excuse to show Rachel Weisz' ass.",2006
8,"I simply want to weigh in with a very positive response to Enemy at the Gates. Taken as a historical drama rather than an attempt to flawlessly depict an historical incident, this is topnotch entertainment. ""Enemy"" portrays the conflict between a young Russian sniper played by Law and the German sniper (Harris) who is sent to kill him during the German attack on Stalingrad during WWII. Apart from a scene which awkwardly caricatures the Russian field commanders and the occasionally distracting accents, the film successfully immerses the viewer in this tense war drama. Appreciate it it for its tight focus, uncompromising realism, and fine characterizations by the main actors. Research the historical accuracy later, if you must, but don't let it spoil the film.",2005

For me, it was the chronicle of that small group of people who don't, and probably never will, quite fit into this world. They're here on the fringes though, just existing in their own parallel universe, or their own ""ghost world."" Though it sounds depressing, this film is hardly a downer, it's full of humor, satire and acute observations on life. The overall production is excellent (the brightness and colors in the photography, costumes and sets is stunning)... plus it pulls off the impossible by successfully steering toward dead-on seriousness near the conclusion to drive it's point across.",2002
9,"Movies that criticise the world can fall into many traps, leaving the viewer to feel jaded by the film's experience.  Ghost World's witty appraisal of 'America' successfully avoids being childishly caustic or self-important and thus emerges as one of the best films of 2001. We sympathise with Enid (the luscious Thora Birch) without being expected to completely believe that her cynical world-view is necessarily the right one. Enid's (and her best-friend Rebecca's)negativity is turned on all around them, and their obsessive need to be cool but on their own terms sees them take post-modernism to its absurd conclusion.",2002

Enid (more than Rebecca) is a counter-culture rebel who hates this world of frauds and losers, and she subsequently has trouble getting and keeping a job. One day the girls decide to play a prank on a lonely middle-aged loser named Seymour. Their plan backfires, though, and Enid becomes a little obsessed with the man. First she feels sorry for Seymour, then he becomes something of a hero to her, and she resolves to help him at least find a girlfriend.

From the comic-book which takes a perverse delight in celebrating the geeky side of all of us, ""Ghost World"" is profane and cynical, but also surprisingly blithe and bright. I rather enjoyed it but realize it's not for every taste. Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson are incredibly rich and vivid in their roles (low-keyed, deadpan, but not blanks); their love-hate friendship is convincing and blessedly free of melodramatics--even they seem to cherish the personality conflicts that come up, it may give them more ammunition. As for the ending, I'm not sure whether it is ingenious or a cop-out, but it did leave me touched (in a bemused, nostalgic way). A movie with much to offer. ***1/2 from ****",2002

Terry Zwigoff is a master director who i believe deserves a lot more credit than he gets. this movie captures not just female teenage life, but teenage life wonderfully. i actually have a tattoo of this movie it means so much to me, i love it and always will have a special spot in my heart. i watch it twice a year and i don't get sick of it, in fact i pick up more every viewing.

To me, ""Ghost World,"" the title, refers to a world that's no longer alive to the main characters, especially Enid, though also to a lesser degree Rebecca and Seymour. Enid's life is no in longer in the world in which she has grown up, certainly not with her father, and not being carried along with the mainstream thoughtlessness and a lock-step life (e.g., just going to college cause everyone else does).

But most importantly, what I found was a similarity between me and her in the way she handles every day life. Basically, I loved this movie because I felt a connection with Enid's personality. The script and acting helped, of course. But I think it goes back to Enid, and I really believe that people who do like this movie will probably say that the best thing about this movie is Enid, and how this character is so great. Obviously the humor in the movie isn't for everyone. They ""don't get it"", and it's quite understandable. Still, for those who do get it, you're in for a treat.",2004

Every single time I watch this movie I discover something new and that is why I keep watching it. If there are original movies left in this world, then one of them should definitely be Ghost World.

""Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles"" is a FUN movie.It's fun to let go and get in on the silliness of the jokes. Critics should not be comparing it to the first or even the second Dundee movies. This film is wonderfully different than both of them, and uniquely funny and endearing all on its own. Yes, Paul Hogan's Mick Dundee is still the same--still sweetly naive. Why critics feel the need to rip the character up for that just goes to show how jaded our society has become when people can't appreciate and embrace a quality like that in a film character. I, for one, love that my children can sit and watch a character who is moral, who is loving and attentive to his wife and child, who seeks out new things and learns from them and for the most part who sees the good in people. What's wrong with sending our children THOSE messages?",2001

The minor disappointment for me is that Paul and Linda had lost some of their charm from 80-s, they are just too old now. But the biggest problem with Crocodile Dundee in L.A. is the thing that this movie is too similar to previous old Crocodile Dundee movies. One idea very rarely can work twice but third time it's simply too much. So if you like the first two Crocodile Dundee movies most likely you will enjoy this little movie or at least you'll tolerate it. The story was a bit primitive (can anybody explain to me what's going on with screenwriters?) but young Serge Cockburn had brought a bit of fresh magic to the movie, though overall acting was pretty average.",2003

I figured he'd have a difficult time with the culture change, but not do such crazy things like he did! LOL absolutely nuts!! The best part has got to be when they are trying to save the skunk on the express way! OMG I though for sure I was going to faint from laughing so hectically hard.

And that's why it's so refreshing to find respite from the drama of day-to-day living-- a safe haven, if you will-- even if it's only for a couple of hours or so at the movies, which is just what you get with the light-hearted comedy, `Crocodile Dundee In Los Angeles,' directed by Simon Wincer.  In this third installment of the `Dundee' series, once again starring Paul Hogan as the famed and fearless crocodile hunter, Mick Dundee, we find Mick, his significant other, Sue Charleton (Linda Kozlowski) and their fourth-grade son, Mikey (Serge Cockburn) living in a small hamlet (population 20) in Australia on the cusp of the Outback.  When the editor of Sue's father's West Coast office of his newspaper in America dies suddenly, Mr. Charleton asks his journalist daughter to fill in for a few weeks until he can find a permanent replacement.  So it's off to Los Angeles for Mick, Sue and Mikey, where Sue quickly finds herself involved with the investigation of a shady new movie studio, while Mick gets work there as an extra on their latest production. There's also plenty of time for Mick and Mikey to explore the terrain of the big city, which is new territory for Mikey, but for Mick-- already a veteran of a trip to New York-- it becomes just one g'day after another, mate.

8,"I went in to this film hoping to entertain my children, a few of their friends who came along, and myself for 90 minutes on a weekend afternoon, and what I got was quality old-fashioned family entertainment and a reintroduction to Paul Hogan's fine comic talent. To most kids my children's ages, Hogan is better known as a spokesman for Subaru station wagons than as an actor. However, he is a wonderful comic actor, fully deserving of vehicles such as this. The yokel- among-the-sophisticates plot is timeless, ranging from Buster Keaton's ""Elmer"" character through the Bowery Boys, Ma and Pa Kettle, Jerry Lewis, Jim Varney, etc. Hogan is working in that classic tradition, and his skills as a physical comedian, his superb comic timing, and his loveable persona will make this film a favorite on cable TV and as a video rental for decades to come. There were no dazzling special effects, nothing shocking, no social or political agenda--just well-performed, funny family comedy. The only flaw, if it can be called that, in the film was that Paul Rodriguez's character was not given enough screen time. I could imagine those two making a great screen pair. Maybe in the next film, Mick Dundee could call on his old friend from the movie business, the character played by Rodriguez, to help him out of some jam. With that large Aussie sidekick who accompanied Dundee in the second half of the film (the name escapes me)playing off both Hogan and Rodriguez, you'd have a great combination! Think about it, Paul Hogan and Lance Hool! I'll pay to bring my family to Crocodile Dundee 4 when it comes out. We had an 8 year old with us viewing the film, and she loved it, so I'd guess that the film should be acceptable to children 6 or over, and there's nothing really offensive in it if you have to take children younger than that. With this and SPY KIDS coming out in the same month, it's been a good season for family films.",2001
6,"All of the Dundee series are light comedy and should be viewed with  that in mind.  Let them entertain you and don't look for an award winning film. Paul Hogan and his wife Linda are pleasant enjoyable personalities, and the story line is innocent with some clever lines thrown in.",2001
4,"The original Crocodile Dundee film was fresh and creative, as was the first sequel, as it juxtaposed the culture of the Outback with the shallowness of modern urban society, tipping its hat to the superiority of the former over the latter. This film, however, seems to have been shot with the idea of profit paramount. The product placements are obvious (Pepsi, Apple computers, Wendy's and, who could miss it, a Subaru Outback station wagon), as is the thinly-developed plot. Paul Hogan was very effective in the earlier films, but in this one he seems tired of the role. Without the novelty available to the earlier films, the only thing that would have saved this one was a vibrant Mick Dundee, and, unfortunately, Hogan could not pull it off.",2006
7,"""Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles"" follows the same fish-out-of-water formula as the original 1986 film with a different setting. That probably explains why its overall IMDb user rating is just 5. People get the feeling that the movie is only repeating, with minor changes, something that was already done. (Like when Mel Brooks used jokes in his Robin Hood movie that he'd used years before in ""Blazing Saddles.""",2001
1,"The first movie was good, the second was the same as the first and the third one was typical third movie syndrome like Spider-man 3, Karate Kid 3, Ninja Turtles 3 and so on.",2014
7,"Crocodile Dundee 2 was not as good as Crocodile Dundee 1 etc, etc.... So we always hear, but so what? View this third offering with an open mind and you will enjoy it without comparison to the first two. I was very pleasantly surprised at the very funny one liners and situations, and came away from the cinema with a smile on my face. Do yourself a favor and rent this for a bit of occasionally hilarious escapism. As one of the other contributors stated, don't take it too seriously, it's a comedy!",2002
7,"Ok, I was three when the first one came out, so I don't remember seeing it in 1986, but I do remember no. 2 in 1988. I've seen both of them too many times to count. Honestly, I never expected another Crocodile Dundee. I thought they had done all that they could with the idea. But, when I saw this movie, I thought wrong. Although this is not even close to being on my list of fav movies, it was worth the 4 bucks I paid to rent it. It wasn't original, but it was funny and entertaining, and that's what's important. too many people take movies like this and compare them to the movies that win Oscars. Personally, I thought this movie was more enjoyable than ""Lord of the Rings,"" and I'm usually in to those kind of movies. 7 out of 10.",2002
7,"It's a fun movie that works for all age groups.  The plot line is thin, but this is a comedy movie and it does deliver on that line.  The jokes are good and the movie is fairly clean.  Don't expect any big theological issues to be discussed, but do be prepared to laugh.",2002
7,"This movie was good nonetheless, but why wait 13 years to make another one? After waiting for about 5 years for a third movie after seeing parts one and two, I was kind of disappointed that I would probably not see another one, but after a 13 year wait, I finally got my wish. This movie didn't have the plot-structure as the first one which would probably hint as to why it was no where near as successful. It was good to see Dundee (Hogan) in a different venue other then the played out scene of New York. It was also good to see Hogan in another theatre release, since he really hadn't appeared in one since he starred with Elijah Wood in 1996's Flipper. Another person I was happy to see again was Sue's character played by Hogan's real-life wife, Linda Kozlowski. Even after 13 years she is still a very beautiful and attractive woman. With the release of this, I wouldn't be surprised if Paul Hogan tried to stay in the spotlight again by releasing a sequel to another one his movies. Lightning Jack 2 or maybe even a Flipper 2. That would be entertaining. Nevertheless, Paul Hogan remains my favorite Aussie actor.",2001
8,"""Not ANOTHER 'Another Teen Movie,'"" is the accompanying groan to most introductions to Wet Hot American Summer. How could a title and premise that simultaneously stupid and generic be anything more than the sum of its exorbitantly familiar parts? It doesn't help that every plot summary reads roughly exactly how you'd expect it to; even stray quotations out of context play like recycled outtakes from American Pie. If anything, it seems amazing how barefaced the film is about its complete unoriginality. ",2015
9,"The strangest point in this film is a point, about a half hour through, when all of the seemingly normal camp counselors go out in to the city.  In a montage shot, they slowly go from reading books at the library, to smoking cigarettes, to smoking joints, to buying cocaine from a guy on the street, to becoming prostitutes, then becoming strung out heroin-addicts at the local crack house.  This is not your parent's parody movie.",2002
1,"OK, I am pretty forgiving and can enjoy a lot of stupid movies. But I REALLY don't get what it is people like about this movie! I like a lot of the actors, but the jokes were NOT funny. I mean maybe 5% of the jokes worked. It was like a long bad SNL skit or something. I just really rally don't get it. I would rather watch Weekend at Bernie's 2 three times in a row than see this again. This movie was flat, unfunny, and just a complete waste of time. I am sorry, I really wanted it to be good, but I think I laughed once the entire time. ",2006
1,"I've been wanting to see this movie ever since I read an article in Entertainment Weekly about how funny it was and included many comedians, that were unknown in 2001, that are well known now. I was completely set to see a movie about camping in the early 80s and when I saw it on Netflix I knew it was time. Then splat, I couldn't believe the garbage I was seeing. Yeah it was cool to see some of my favorite comedians and actors in one of their earlier films, like Paul Rudd, but I didn't laugh once. I saw it as a dramedy trying too hard to have some comedic value but failed miserably. Maybe it was my expectations or maybe you had to have experienced camps similar to this to understand it. Whatever the reason I can safely say that I am glad I never watched this film when it came out or I might not have risked seeing some of the actors' later films.",2011
9,"""Wet Hot American Summer"" is an overlooked comic gem and an absurdest spoof of those god-awful summer camp movies from the 1980's. If you enjoy ""Monty Python"" style sketch humor or were a fan of ""The State"" (many of the players are employed here) or ""Kids in the Hall,"" then this is the ticket for you. People who enjoy humor more in line with the Farelly Brothers or the ""American Pie"" films probably just won't ""get this."" It's all a matter of taste and your sense of humor. But seriously, how can you go wrong with a movie that has a pep talk from a talking can of vegetables or an overly dramatic chase scene where the person doing the chasing is thwarted by a single barrel of hay in the middle of a wide open road? My personal favorite is when the guy is driving the van singing along to ""Danny's Song"" and then out of nowhere screams bloody murder as he slams into a tree. Oh, and who can forget the hilariously rapid decent into the underworld of drugs and despair by the kids spending an hour away from camp in town? This is also a must see for people who appreciate Janeane Garafalo's comic timing and Molly Shannon's bizarre brand of humor. This film was grossly overlooked when it hit theaters, but I think there is a cult following waiting for this movie. I hope these people are allowed to collaborate on another comedy. If they are, then we may have a new dawn of ""Monty Python"" style humor infecting the barbarian hordes.",2003
1,I can only assume the high ratings and stellar reviews for this film were bought and paid for. I registered for an account for the sole purpose to warn others what a complete waste of time this movie was. I tuned in because the cast contained so many actors and actresses I have enjoyed in other roles and expected at least a modicum humor.,2015
10,"Wet Hot American Summer is without question, the funniest movie to come out in years, and certainly among the funniest I've ever seen. The reason you might not have heard of it is because it isn't as advertised as other movies, because it doesn't have the type of budget to advertise itself. It breaks my heart that horribly made, unfunny, unoriginal movies, such as American Pie 2, were in more theaters and are more available to rent or buy.",2002
9,"Wet Hot American Summer is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time. It has an excellent cast, including: Janeane Garofalo, David Hyde Pierce, Michael Showalter, Paul Rudd, Chris Melloni, Amy Poehler and Michael Ian Black. This spoof of summer camp movies from the 70's and 80's does a great job of recreating the implausible and predictable plots of the movies of the ear while still staying incredibly funny and fresh. WHAS touches on all the old themes, such as the nice guy trying to get the hot girl, the director awkwardly trying to find love, and the outcast who saves the day. Some of the funniest scenes in the movie are the ones that are so random and unexpected-Andy and the kids in the van, the trip into town, etc.-that you just have to laugh. I have no idea why it didn't receive more attention. It's a shame that a movie this good hasn't received the attention that it deserves.",2004
1,"I checked this movie out based on the recommendation of a local movie critic. He mentioned all of the young actors (mostly unknown at the time) and how the movie was underrated. Well he was dead wrong! There are a couple of good laughs involving Paul Rudd, but mostly this movie is just terrible! There's a reason most people have never heard of this film. Halfway through this film I kept checking the clock, thinking ""is this over yet!?"" The only redeeming feature of this movie is to play ""name that star"". Some are young enough that they are hardly recognizable (i.e. Bradley Cooper). Save yourself the wasted time and go rent ""Meatballs"", an actual fun and funny camp movie.",2011
5,"Wet Hot American Summer is the kind of movie where you either get it or you don't. If you do, you're good. If you don't, you are the red-headed step child among your friends and are subject to ridicule because you didn't laugh all that much. I have to say I'm in that category, but I appreciated what the film was doing. It was trying to be a different movie for a certain crowd. It succeeds in being different, but not much else.",2011
1,"There are so many struggling film makers with good ideas, who would love to have David Hyde-Pierce or Jeanine Garafolo help get their films made. Good original films. Bit, no! They star in this tripe. Why this was made, I don't know. Writer/producer/director David wain obviously has unresolved issues about being a nerd at summer camp, but this unfunny movie ought to have stayed private between him and his therapist. Porky's and American Pie , though gross, each have something to say about youth and sex. This movie says nothing. Even Meatballs is better. And of course, Woody Allen does the alienated Jewish intelligentsia experience definitively. Wet Hot American Summer is not even good enough to be so bad its funny.",2002
8,"This movie made me so happy.  The performers are so gifted.  The details in the art direction and characterizations were pretty spot-on too.  Amy Poehler in particular delighted me.  That girl rocks my world.  Everyone has their moment though.  In this time when parodies are almost more common than original ideas, this movie stands out as one of the best.",2002
10,"This movie is not funny.  It's Friggin' HILARIOUS.  The first time I watched it was during the winter and I laughed a few times, but remembering the motorcycle chase scene, I gave it another run and was blown away.  I haven't laughed so hard since the second time I saw ""The Big Lebowski"" and I ended up buying my own copy.  ",2003
10,"They don't get any worse than summer camp movies, but nothing is funnier than this satire aimed at that very genre.  People who came of age in the early eighties ( like me ) may get more of the jokes, but the movie is great all the way through.  The cast is impeccable, the writing is spot on, and a much neglected era is brought to life convincingly.  Many jokes start out as the same old predictable stuff but get turned on their heads.  Watch until the very end of the credits for one of the funniest jokes I have ever seen on film; it's worth the price of admission for that alone.  Fans of the State, the most brilliant sketch comedy show of the past 187 years, will go absolutely crazy over this.  A must see film that puts to shame many a period piece.",2002

1,"I guess a lot of the reviewers are less that 14 years old and think that jokes about lice are just the funniest thing in the universe or maybe they just have the IQ of a rock. This movie was so BADLY over acted and TERRIBLY directed and the script so CHILDISHLY written that the mere watching of it was worse than ""train wreck"" status. The budget is listed here at approximately 5 million: Cheap enough by 21st century standards. Opening week it brought in $17,481 and did a gross business of $292,102! That pretty much sums up what the theater goers thought of this dreck. They hated it!!! No word of mouth here! So about 48 thousand people actually paid to see this and it died on the vine virtually overnight. There are over 5,000 theaters with over 39,000 screens in the USA. If it had a general release at just 100 screens, with 3 showings a day, the average audience for the weekend was about 50 people per show. That translates to about 20 viewers per showing on Sunday. The producers, investors, and even theater owners lost pot fulls of money on this dog.",2014
10,"Hilarious. A goofy, nostalgic spoof of the early 80's. I loved this movie in all its crudeness and sincerity. See it, these people deserve to make more films.

This film doesn't want to do anything but make you laugh and it succeeds.",2001

I think I was almost lynched at the end of the evening!  NOBODY LAUGHED ONCE!  I completely get the concept (and it is a good idea) the problem is, every 80's summer movie it lampoons is actually at least a LITTLE funny.  This movie has at most two half smiles. It is awful.  There is no continuity, bad tech. srtuff all around.   There are some very funny people in this film - but they must have owed money to somebody, because there is absolutely no excuse for this crap!",2002
1,the internet movie database lists this movie under the genre of comedy and i think they should review their choice and possible invent a new genre called worthless. Jeneanne Garofolo an intelligent comedian picks another unintelligent movie to star in. this film even with a ton of attractive ladies in it manages to avoid anything that might be considered a redeeming quality. The movies like Meatballs and Porky's that this movie aspires to at least never insulted their audience. This movie never gives you a chance. The characters are played so absolutely paper thing that 2x4s could aptly fill the acting spots. Whatever deeply troubled soul is responsible for this movie should probably spend the rest of their life in prison in order to give them time to think about what they want to say in apology on the day they meet their maker. I would recommend this only on the basis of showing someone that ANYONE IN THE WORLD can write a better and funnier movie than this.,2003
1,"I understand the parody aspect of this film, but Wet, Hot American Summer makes Meatballs look like Shakespeare.  I'm not saying that the film doesn't have its moments, but they are far too few and far between for me to give anything other than my lowest rating.

There are directors who have done nail-biting suspense, usually drenched in subtext, like the Director, Alfred Hitchcock. There are others who can do whatever they want and create beautiful, detached yet powerful films like Stanley Kubrick. Then there are ones who are brilliant with ensembles, telling stories which converge and often overlap within a main plot. One of them is the great Woody Allen. The other one is Robert Altman.",2005
10,"The reason why many viewers strongly dislike or even hate the movie ""Gosford Park"" is because they misunderstand the point trying to be made. Gosford Park wasn't made to focus on whodunit (if it was, why would they tell you who did). If viewers think that Gosford Park is ""boring"" or ""confusing"" or even ""the worst movie ever"", it may be that you're not willing to see what really is portrayed: the authenticity and its story. The authenticity of Gosford Park is as close as it can get to real life as it was back then as it can get. Experts who were maids, butlers, or cooks themselves were constantly at the scene criticizing the actors behavior and moves. Another main focus is the story behind it. The brilliant story as well as excellent character development are like no other: only Robert Altman could do a film such as this. So, next time you see it (which I highly recommend that you do), be PATIENT and actually be WILLING the enjoy the differences in film-making, not just the kind of films you like.",2004

People think that this film sucks because they don't like multi-story plot and they find it difficult to follow the stories.

However, those who really appreciate and understand the movie know more than clear that the film itself focuses on the life of the upper-class people (and the life of the time) rather than a bloody crime.

1,"I saw Gosford Park in theaters way back in April 2002, after it was nominated for a slew of Academy Awards a month earlier. Naturally, I was looking forward for some good social satire in the shape of the always reliable ""clash of the classes"" theme. Robert Altman had the right pedigree as a director, and I actually liked some of his previous works such as The Player and Dr. T and the Women, so there was some cause for interest there. Also, this was promoted as a story of a classic old Hollywood murder mystery, another motivation to go see it. Boy was I wrong. ",2007
4,"nice costumes, good performances, but an EXTREMELY long movie with an uncreative, unimaginative script.

I guess from a tech standpoint, the look of the film is handled well and the stuffy british actors which dominate the proceedings act like stuffy british people.. and Ryan Phillippe looks way out of place in his role... but the film did manage to remind me of why i usualy dont like Altman movies, his last several have just been incredibly dull.

I was hooked after 1 episode and watched an entire season in 1 night. By the end of the 3 months I had watched all 19 seasons of the show. It became my new obsession. Easily the best show on TV, even the duller seasons such as 4, 8, or 13 are still awesome and entertaining. I know this show is definitely not for everyone, you need to like reality shows to enjoy this (obviously), but if you are a fan of survivor, big brother, or even fear factor, I would definitely suggest giving this amazing show a chance.",2012
10,"'The Amazing Race 5' is the BEST of all six complete seasons to date. If you've never seen the show, I recommend this season over all others. Why? Season 5 had a combination of interesting and amiable teams as well as original locations, only 2 of which had already been visited in previous seasons. The 'Bowling Moms', Linda and Karen, added a lot of fun to the show - they were almost always lively and seeing them go so far on the race (to 4th place) was a highlight. Although I liked Colin and Christie, seeing Chip and Kim win was great - it was unexpected - and this is what added to this season's success. What I particularly liked about the locations visited was that producers for the most part avoided Europe (save for Russia, which was interesting) and visited other places, more interesting places, like South America and the Middle East. I'm just hoping that CBS releases the seasons on DVD - if they do, choose this one! 5 Star Entertainment - so much more refreshing than Seasons 6 and 7.",2005
9,"There are hundreds of reality shows on television now, all over the world, but only one captures the excitement. fun, drama, exhilaration, competition and intelligence of a great show. That show is The Amazing Race. Eleven paired contestants travel all over the world completing objectives and challenges on their way to the final ""Pit Stop"" of the day. Not only are these challenges physical, but all mental and frustrating. Players have to keep it together with themselves and their partner if they are to make it to the end ahead of everyone else. The last couple who makes it to the ""Pit-Stop"" is usually eliminated. The show is so fun to watch not only for the incredible locations and exciting race on foot, in car, by plane and train through each city, but also because of all the drama between contestants and their partners. Many partners are so competitive, that they get frustrated with their partner or themselves and it shows on camera in many different ways. Every episode is a blast to watch. you never know what's going to happen next or what location they will travel to. It's fun seeing the world and culture of other people. It's even more fun watching the couples navigate though an unfamiliar environment. One wrong turn or flat tire could push them into last place. There are other great reality shows like American Idol, So You Think You Can Dance. Top Chef, Chopped, America's Got Talent, but none of them are as creative or interesting as The Amazing Race. No wonder it's already on it's 18th season, as they've decided to do 2 seasons a year now. The show is so popular. Definitely check this show out.",2011

I particularly like the fact that a normal sibling relationship was shown, the rivalry and disdain but still the reality that blood is thicker than water and no matter if you think that your brother or sister is a twerp, you still do anything for them. The family sticks together and although it is a very far-fetched concept, it was a movie both my children and I liked. It was filled with action and adventure but the good guys come out on top in the end against overwhelming odds. I think we could all use a little more optimism now and this movie delivers it. Carmen and Junie were not the impossibly perfect kids seen in most movies now. Nor were they brats who only care about themselves in other movies.  They were too athletic to be real children, but I'd like to think that they are showing the kids seeing the movie that they can do anything that they put their mind to. Overall, a terrific family movie the kids will actually like-even though their parents do too.",2002
7,"This is a somewhat unusual film; it's a children's film, but it doesn't talk down to its audience. And as an added bonus, it can be watched even if you are over ten. As the far too little-known short Bedhead, Robert Rodriguez has here created a film for children, featuring children... which doesn't treat them with the lack of respect for the smarts and sense of logic that they do already possess. Adults often forget what children are like, and think of them as 'less' than the grownups. Rodriguez gives them(and us) a film that allows them a similar status to adults. The film has stuff that will appeal to kids(spy equipment hidden in children's things) but it isn't offensive to us who aren't. While it is more directed towards those of the preteen persuasion, it doesn't aim so low as to feel stupid for us who aren't of said persuasion. The plot is pretty good, though I guess it's not all that original... and as usual with children's films, the kids are the heroes, which puts too much pressure on them, as a Danish film critic so perfectly put it. The acting is a usual high(as most of the actors are quite talented), no performances really let you down, even the (intentionally)overplayed ones. The characters, many of them fairly clichéd and thin, are all credible. As with many(most) Rodriguez films, pretty much all of those that he's written, himself... there are subplots and such, many of which are either overly easily resolved or not properly addressed. The humor is pretty good, I laughed out loud several points, rather unusual for children's films, and I was never insulted by the humor. None of it tries too hard to garner laughs, either. The special effects are quite impressive, and though it's still evident that it's Rodriguez' mini studio, it will fool you for the very most part. The action is quite intense and exciting, and like the humor, it's got Rodriguez' unique touch. Any fan of Rodriguez(such as myself, which is by far the main reason I watched this very film in the first place) will enjoy this, if maybe not to the same extent as one of his typical films. I recommend this to any fan of Rodriguez or any of the actors, and definitely most kids. Very much worth watching, even if you've outgrown childhood. Indulge your inner kid. 7/10",2006
4,I loved this film as a kid and wanted to go back and watch it again to spot all the moments I enjoyed first time around.,2015
9,"Finally, a live-action family movie that entertained me and my wife immensely, while my six-year old daughter had a blast too!",2001
5,"""Spy Kids"" was a big kids hit! I thought it was pretty cool that there are these two kids Carmen and Juni Cortez who have to save their parents from danger. But I think it could have been better. I didn't really like how they showed how Carmen and Juni's parents got married because seriously, lets get on with the movie!!! But I LOVED the cast. Alexa Vega, i thought was the best one in the cast! She is a great teenage actress and should go really far in the Hollywood movie making business. Daryl Sabara was so cute playing Juni and should go far as well. There was Also Antonio Banderas, and it was an okay movie, not the best, but i expected better.",2005
7,"I watched the first one finally, and have to say that despite the cheesy story plot at times, it wasn't that bad. Some kids find out they are spies and end up having to save their parents from some evil dude. The technology and gadgets are very impressive and funny. I liked the age the kids were, not too old (teenager) but not too young to not be, I guess, easy to relate too.",2012
1,"This movie is best described with a capitol S, and it's not for,""super,"" trust me. The concept was rather cute, ""little kids save their spy parents,"" but the execution was, well, weird. The bad guys live in a virtual world of Thumb Monsters and deformed mutants, which manage to look stupid and creepy all at the same time. Often, the special effects and screen concepts look simply rediculous, the plot turns are stupid, and the characters are 2 dimensional. What could be worse than Spy Kids? The SEQUEL! OH, NASTY!!!!!!!!!! I don't want to think about it, and I am DEFINITELY not going to see it!",2001
2,"this movie was incredibly stupid with meaning what so ever. i fell bad for all the actors and actresses that ruined there career to be in this stupid movie. the entire movie was based on how unrealistic they could make it, to make little like it which made it even stupider. even some of the names were unrealistic. the film is fun to watch which is why it had 2 out of 10 stars. this is probably the 3rd stupidest movie ever made. i got really made after i realized that it had mostly adult actors in it yet in was a kid movie. the most upsetting one was Danny Trejo a horror movie actor who is always dirty. the other actors were pretty much clean as far as i'm concerned.",2008
5,"I saw the ads and thought SPY KIDS looked awful.  Saw the stills, thought they looked awful (just posing the kids defensively in front of the parents, all in a fighting stance, implies incredible irresponsibility).  I kept reading these wonderful reviews about what a delightful confection this is, and eventually I got suckered in, thinking I didn't want to miss another BABE or something, and the film was probably being poorly marketed to get the kiddies.",2001
2,"This is really an awful film. There is almost nothing good about it. The music is pretty good. The beginning is OK and the scene with George Clooney in the end is good too. FAST forward the rest, for it is pure crap and a complete waste of time. I mean it is nice to see actors as Trejo, Marin, Banderas and Clooney pay tribute to Rodriguez, who all starred in one of his films before becoming (more or less) of an item (again or not), but they all are mostly wasted here. I hope I'll see Banderas, Clooney, Trejo and Marin in Rodriguez' next though: Once upon a time in Mexico. (I'm kind of hoping for Tarantino as well).",2002
1,"Wow, this is a really bad movie! O.k., it's supposed to be a movie for kids, but is this a reason for a bad story development (this kind of story definitely had the potential to produce a good movie) and a huge mass of logical errors? I think not. And so did many kids that saw the movie, as I noticed afterwards. There are lots of good movies for children, but this one is definitely not one of them. We all know Rodriguez can do it better, at least in the ""grown-ups-section"". Maybe he should just keep his hands off of movies for children. Anyway, keep your hands off of this movie. You will regret if you don't.",2001
1,"Honestly, I don't know where to start. I first saw this movie when I was nine years old, and it insulted my intelligence then. Having just seen a few fragments recently while my younger siblings were watching it, I decided to do a comprehensive criticism of exactly WHY it was so terrible. And let me tell you, there are plenty of reasons. Here are my top three.",2013
10,"When I saw this movie, I immediately was pulled in and obsessed. The trailers made the movie look bad, so I decided, no I shouldn't see it. Then on rotten tomatoes, I saw 93% which is a great amount. I decided to see it, and I loved it. For anyone who is uncertain about seeing this movie, go for it. It is an original, unexpected journey, that you can see repeatedly, and will not get bored. I think the best part of this movie is... the storyline, and the acting. Outstanding roles from Alexa Vega, Daryl Sabara (Carmen and Juny), and any other actor/actress in the movie. I recommend any parents to go take there kids to this movie.",2012
7,"Robert Rodriguez's Spy Kids has a very special significance for me: it's the first movie I ever saw in theatres, and therefore left quite an impression on me. It has loads of Rodriguez's trademark imagination and vision, as well as a stacked cast and a whimsical sense of adventure that makes it a super charged Saturday morning cartoon style bucket of fun. Rodriguez makes two types of films: shamelessly violent, over the top, bloody genre fun, and family orientated sci fi/fantasy for kids. He fares better in the former, as this is really the only good one in the secondary category. The sequels are trash, and I don't know what he was thinking with Sharkboy and Lava Girl, but with this one his filmmaking skill and passion for the craft work its charm and provide a wonderful experience. Newcomers Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara play youngsters Carmen and Juni Cortez, who are surprised to learn that their unassuming parents (Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino) are in fact lethal undercover spies, and need their help after being kidnapped by eccentric megalomaniac Floop (Alan Cumming hamming it up terrifically). Aided by their uncles Felix (Cheech Marin) and Machete (Danny Trejo) they embark on a dazzling adventure to find Floop's surreal, isolated palace, take down baddies Ms. Gredanko (Teri Hatcher) and Mr. Lisp (Robert Patrick) and save their parents. The four have amazing chemistry as a familial unit, especially when it comes time to kick major butt. The practical based effects have a wondrous vitality, from the Thumb Thumb henchman to the eye boggling, Terry Gilliam-esque realm that Floop resides in. There's also work from Tony Shaloub, Mike Judge, Richard Linklater and a sly cameo from George Clooney. No shortage of imagination, creativity and fun.",2016
9,"Spy Kids (2001): Dir: Robert Rodriguez / Cast: Antonio Banderas, Carla Gugino, Alan Cumming, Tony Shalhoub, Richard Cheech Marin: Wonderfully inventive and exhilarating experience for families. It is about little people doing big things. The special effects are totally creative with a story that is straight forward but a lot of fun. Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino are captured spies by an entertainer who mutates spies as props for his show. Gugino tells of the two spies who were suppose to eliminate each other but ultimately fell in love instead. Their children catch on quickly when villains that resemble thumbs search for a device called the Third Brain. Alan Cumming plays a villain who desires to take over the world using robotic children and the third brain is needed. Director Robert Rodriguez outdoes himself here with inventive visuals and creative gimmicks. This is a far stretch from the gory horror films he is known for such as From Dusk Till Dawn and The Faculty. Banderas and Gugino are a wonderful pairing with Alan Cumming on target as the entertainer. Tony Shalhoub plays the scheming villain. Richard Cheech Marin is an amusing edition as an uncle who is in on the big parental secret. The third act is mainly numerous action sequences that present cartoon style violence and predictable results. Otherwise this is a challenging family friendly visual delight. Score: 9 / 10",2015
4,"Childhood nostalgia, that is simply the 2 words why I saw this movie again. I watched the first three movies quite a bit as a kid and I can even tell you why. Around the time I was into James Bond so when I saw this movie I saw it as the same except with kids (I was 7!). So watching this movie again did bring back some childhood memories but that's about all it did.",2014
8,"Spy Kids is a special kind of family film that will please adults and children alike. What a rarity. I critique family films by judging if both the parent and the child will enjoy seeing the film. The parents buy the movie or the ticket for the kids, so they should both be provided with entertainment.",2011
7,"The only problem i found about ""Thirteen Ghosts"" is that it is not scary. It has the elements to be a horror movie, the ghosts, the gore, but it is not frightening at all.",2005
7,It doesn't rely on too much splatter and it doesn't try to startle you out of your seat every two minutes so that immediately makes it better than the average horror flick. The ghosts were unusual enough to be memorable and there was not a lot of familiarity to the plot. This was very nearly an excellent film with a solid cast and very good effects. Five or ten more minutes of scary interaction between the ghosts and the children(if you can call Shannon Elizabeth a child) would have made the movie much better. I call it a near miss which is as good as most horror fils can aspire to.,2002
6,"I watched this movie last night, and I thought it was entertaining. Sure, it's a B-movie and has its flaws - it's a bit silly, it's not particularly horrifying (although I must admit no movie has scared me in 10-15 years, and I've watched quite a lot of horror flicks), it's a tad silly (Ghostbusters meets Buffy the Vampire Slayer?). But as B-horror movies go, this one is entertaining for those who like films with supernatural phenomena and people dying in ""imaginative"" ways. Actually, Thir13en Ghosts reminded me of one of my favourite films, The Cube. But that's just the reason I can't give a lot of points for this movie - there are better B-movies with which to entertain yourself. Cube-films sum up the better parts of the film and dispense with boring love-issues. But then again, there are heck of a lot more crappier films than this, and it was funny enough for me to even buy it for five or so euros in case I came across this in a store.",2006
6,"'Thir13en Ghosts' is a movie with lots of flashing images and loud sounds. Most of the time that is a little annoying, although there are moments it adds something to the scary events that happen. I am not a big fan of the horror-genre, although I can appreciate it when it is done good. Here you have no real story, but there are some real scares. Since it is about ghosts those things can turn up anytime and anywhere. One of the characters even explains that ""they like to do that"".",2004
8,"I saw the original 13 Ghosts when I was 12 years old and it scared me half to death. They gave you a viewer so when the ghosts appeared on screen you looked thru one color and could see them, but if you looked thru the other color you couldn't see them. Now that I see that movie again I wonder what I was scared of. But I loved all of William Castle's movies. He was the master of gimmicks and chills in his day. Now comes a new version of the old story, packed with gore and shocks galore in living color. No glasses or special optical device handed out at the theater this time. The film hits you with a punch to the senses in the opening scenes before settling down to a poor man struggling to make ends meet after the tragic death of his wife. He later learns that his dear wife's ""ghost"" has been captured by his eccentric uncle and is kept in a special cage in the basement. While vastly different from the original, this film can stand on its own. It is a complete retelling of the story with great action, special fx, acting and a few laughs thrown in as well as some references to the original. If you are just looking for some mindless supernatural fun and maybe even a moral (love is stronger than evil) this film is for you.",2006
6,"This is one of those movies that you cannot hate fully, but you cannot like fully either. Something is missing, I can't point a finger to EXACTLY what it is, but I know if ""it"" were included, this movie would have been a blockbuster.",2002

10,"I see that most people aren't nearly as fond of this one as I am, so I feel compelled to write why I *did* like it.",2003
9,"This film is very much like Marmite. It makes you sick to the back teeth because it's just that bad, or it makes you twitch every time you see in the paper that Thir13en Ghosts is on. I, myself, fall into the latter category. I loved every second of this film! I saw this a few weeks back, I was bored and I was flicking stations on TV. Luckily, the film was only just starting. The scrapyard scene had me hooked. One downside to this was that Cyrus Kriticos (F. Murray Abraham) got killed off quite quickly. I would have liked to see a little more about his past, but then that would be trailing from the path of this story. Notwithstanding, the very feel that this film gave me was astounding. The makeup on all the ghosts had me looking away at times. I thought it quite strange that the ghost we saw the most of was naked to the eye, there should have been a bit of camera-share there. As we are really starting to get into this story, we find out that Kalina (Embeth Davidtz), the woman who is also trapped in the house, is actually helping the ghost of Cyrus. A small problem there, is he dead or not? He had a chunk of metal wrapped around his neck, yet he can be seen without the ghost-seeing glasses. Perhaps it's just me, I may have had my fingers clasped around my eyes.",2005

As reclusive Dr. Zorba has died and left his eerie mansion to his penniless nephew Cyrus Zorba (Tony Shaloub) and his sons (Shannon Elizabeth , Alec Roberts) .

An ethereal voice ? Well fill in your own favourite voice from nowhere film moment .",2003
4,"Before i went out to rent 13 ghosts I was expecting it to be a little different than other horror movies and a lot more scarier. After viewing it for the first time i was dissapointed as their didn't seem to be much of a storyline to this film. This was a movie about greed, betrayal and wasn't realistic enough. The film though did have its good bits as well as the bad bits. Some things were done ingeniously such as the glasses as when you would put them on you could see them or with the role of the psychic (played by Mathew Lillard) who I must say once again performed brilliantly in this role as he does with his other movies. The way the ghosts were captured was cleverly done and most of them were very well costumized and they looked the scary part but others didn't. Overall I gave it a 4/10 because of the special effects, the brilliant acting of Mathew Lillard which I must say I'm a big fan of and some of the scenes were actually pretty cool and well done.",2002
1,"While anyone must admit that the original ""13 Ghosts"" was no masterpiece, it stands as a monumental achievement in filmmaking when compared to this reeking, plotless mess. Aside from a funny line here and there, this movie shows no discernible quality that makes it worth watching. Sure, the implausible, mechanical glass house with the allegedly Latin inscriptions on the walls is rather interesting to look at, but, unfortunately, glimpses of it are interrupted and marred by the silly film that keeps intruding.",2001
1,"""Thir13een Ghosts"" really only exceeds in one area: that it's just another addition of the list of cheesy movies with numbers incorporated into the title (see: Murd3r 8y Num83rs).  This hasn't been clever since ""Se7en"", which fits because this movie is anything BUT clever or original.",2002

1,"This is a continuance of the disturbing trend in Hollywood where movies that have a lot of effects, are ""scary"", with absolutely no substance are being produced. I just finished watching it and it was the worst crap I've seen since (i am sorry to say)...last week... =)",2002
1,It seems that the director spent too much effort on the set design and not so much on giving the movie some meat. The movie has too many botches in it to maintain any suspense for a sustained period. The story had potential... only wish more effort was put into getting more dramatic acting from the cast.,2002
9,"""MY WIFE AND KIDS,"" in my opinion, is an absolute ABC classic! I haven't seen every episode, but I still enjoyed it. There are many episodes that I enjoyed. One of them was where Junior (George O. Gore II) got his driver's license. If you want to know why, you'll have to have seen it for yourself. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well-designed, and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, even though it can be seen in syndication now, I strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good.",2006

7,"This show was crap when it first came on. The first actress that played the daughter didn't fit the role, the writing was hit or miss, and Damon Wayans CLEARLY wasn't comfortable doing such a cornball family friendly show. The chemistry between himself and Tisha Cambell (they're long time friends, as are all of the Wayans clan with Tisha's husband and Will Smith and Jada Pinkett) DID work so they retooled the show. Once it returned, they recast the daughter, made the son much dumber (a la Eric from ""Boy Meets World"")and made the youngest daughter into a genius...(later they gave her a little genius boyfriend to do comedic guest appearances). The show, while if often rollercoasters from over the top buffoonery to being corny walks the line enough to keep it as a show that you can see Damon Wayans be comfortable in his own skin on the set (especially since the main writers, directors and consultants were ALL members of the Wayans family) AND in his character. Once everyone had been on the show for a while, they worked to everyone in the casts strengths and were able to make a consistently funny show on the air.",2006
1,Lets be realistic here. This is one of the worst shows I have ever seen. My Wife and Kids showed real promise in its first season and only went down hill after that. It is so bad that words do not describe. The acting and writing are so dreadful on a consistent basis I wonder if Damon Wayans was producing such an atrocious show on purpose. From top to bottom every performance is ridiculous. Damon Wayans completely phones it in and George Gore II is so horrible I cringe at every over-acted line. Can anyone really watch this show and find it to be entertaining let alone funny? Please I implore you. Do not watch this show. As soon as TV affiliates stop picking this up in syndication we can finally be rid of this absolute garbage.,2007

2,"I never really started watching the show until it was canceled and started showing re-runs. I actually enjoyed it for the first to third season. Once I saw the fourth and fifth one I was beginning to get irate. The first problem was that they did that irrelevant, scenario of history repeating itself (Jr having a kid like his parents did). The second had to be the one where they had everyone paired up with someone (ex: Katie and franklin) . The third one was when they made Jr even more idiotic than before which was beginning to be tedious and vexing to the point where I wanted to go into the T.V. and beat the stupidity out of him until he's unconscious . The fourth one had to be that zealous dork that Clarie claimed as a boyfriend. The fifth one had to be Katie, she was beginning to be too good for herself and was treated her ""boyfriend"" Franklin like the pushover he was. The last but not least was Noah Gray-Cabey!! Franklin, Franklin was just scary. It was like watching a terrible combination of Urkle and TJ Henderson only more annoying!!! They seriously jumped the shark when came he to the show. There was little to no realism to his character and the way he laughed was a sign of obvious force showing that Noah can't act. Eveytime I saw that kid just made me want slap he silly.

Michael Kyle is not your average father, he teaches his family life lessons with sometimes outrageous ploys. He goes to great lengths just to get his point across.

8,"No contest, I will say this marks the best of the Farrelly Brothers.  Not because this film is laugh-out-loud funny--it's funny, but not hilarious--but because it has a great heart and delivers a beautiful message without any corny Hollywood pretentions.  Sure, the premise is funny--a shallow guy gets virtually hypnotized into thinking all the unattractive women he sees are foxes and ends up going out with a 500-pound woman who he also thinks is a fox.  It's a great premise, but the Farrellys don't fixate on that premise alone, preventing it from turning it into a lame, one-joke slapstick comedy.  This is a comedy with heart--a rare finding.  In between laughs, you really get wrapped up in the characters and storyline.  The gags flow quite naturally, without the Farrellys forcing any humor onto the screen.  If a comic opportunity comes along, they take advantage, but there's no random acts of slapstick.",2002
10,"I loved this movie and thought Jack Black was at his best in it.  He carried the whole movie along with Gwyneth Paltrow and they both did an excellent job filling roles unlike any they have done before.  Many people will like this non traditional comedy that has a strong moral message.  If you are someone who enjoys a lighthearted meaningful story than definitely see this movie.  Don't be fooled by reviews that say it makes fun of overweight people (only) because it's message is that size doesn't and shouldn't matter. Yes, the main characters are shallow and say some awful things, but their main purpose is to represent those of us who need to change the way we view and treat other human beings.  I've always like Jack Black as a comedian but never pictured him as a ""boyfriend"" character until seeing this movie.  He was able to transform the very shallow unappealing Hal into a very likeable person. See it for Gwyneth if anything, she is very cute in it.",2003
10,"I know many complain it wasnt as funny as past farelly movies such as ""Something about Mary"" or ""Kingpin"".  But it wasnt supposed to be.  It was intended to be a comedy, and it was extremely successful, and it was very funny, however it wasnt supposed to be non-stop, grossout laughs like their past efforts.  I always liked the Farelly Brothers's movies because while hilarious, they always had an underlying sweetness to them.  I think this one prevailed the most in that department-  I think 'Shallow Hal' is an incredibly sweet, and even more upon second viewing, just a charming, great movie-watching experience.  I think if people give it another chance and cut it some slack in the non-stop jokes department, they will see it for the great, enjoyable movie with a message that it really is.",2003
7,"The Farrely Brothers, these are very odd film makers, they have such hits like There's Something About Mary, Dumb and Dumber and Me, Myself and Irene. I wasn't too thrilled with There's Something About Mary after all the hyped reviews, I was thinking that their other movies would be like that. Especially with the touchy subject of obesity in our world that usually big people are not attractive, making it into a comedy is tricky. But somehow I really loved Shallow Hal. Even though it was a bit hypocritical, it's still really funny and I think it's mainly due to the cast. Jack Black made for a great male lead going from a total jerk into someone that the audience absolutely adored in the end.",2003
10,"""Shallow Hal"" is the best film about love, dating, and being shallow that I have seen since ""The Tao Of Steve"".  This is also the best Farrelly Brothers film I have ever seen.  It even beats out ""There's Something About Mary"". Jack Black rocks as 'Shallow' Hal Larsen, a man who wants the perfect woman but ends up falling for the perfect woman.  Gwyneth Paltrow did very well as Hal's overweight but big-hearted girlfriend.  Not only were the characters well-written, the story was well executed and well plotted.  It was unexpected in several ways and I really liked it.  The Farrelly Brothers score a critically-acclaimed in-park home run with ""Shallow Hal"".  I give this film 10 out of 10!",2002
8,"Part comedy, drama, and romance this one was a rather good little movie to watch.  Black and Paltrow were great and Jason Alexander was hilarious.  The movie is about a guy named Hal who is a rather decent guy, but he has a problem.  When picking women he only looks at the outer beauty of a woman...this is explained in the opening scene.  Hal gets trapped in an elevator with a guy who opens Hal's mind to the inner beauty of women.  Hal then suddenly finds the more unattractive girls perfect for him and this leads to some funny scenes.  This also leads him to Rose Mary a gal he finds perfect, but everyone else sees a 300lb gal.  This movie says a lot about how shallow our society is and does a good job of it.  Though I don't think every unattractive or fat gal is beautiful on the inside and every attractive gal is ugly on the inside as the movie implies.  The movie also could have been more clear that people Hal already knows would still look the same.  I just wish ladies were as open and approachable as the movie portrays.",2003

10,"Guys, let me hand you one piece of advice. If you have a girlfriend or S.O. of another designation who has self-esteem issues, sit down with her and introduce her to this movie. I can't recommend it enough. It's the kind of romantic comedy that you can both enjoy evenly, without one of you or the other gritting their teeth and trying to make it look like a smile. Yes, it shows people being shallow, callous, and sometimes mean, but it also portrays some of those same people growing, maturing, and taking on depth. The casting is great. Gwyneth Paltrow is cute and sweet, and Jack Black walks the line between comedic goofball and serious romantic very well. Sure, there's a predictable happy ending, but the most popular romance stories tend to have that in common. Romeo and Juliet isn't everyone's cup of chai, after all. There are laughs, but this movie has heart, too. 10 out of 10. Both thumbs way up.",2008
1,"I could not stop watching this film because I was desperate to know exactly how the Farrelly brothers could possibly get themselves out of the huge pit they had dug for themselves. This film claims to be challenging what is considered beautiful in our society. In one section a character expresses the moral heart of the film by saying that ""beauty is in the eye of the beholder"" and by suggesting that we are hypnotised into believing what is and is not beautiful by the media etc. Fair enough! However, all representations of inner beauty are portrayed in clichéd and predictable stereotypes of female beauty in exactly the same way you would find in any Hollywood blockbuster. Thus, the film reinforces the same notions of beauty that it claims it is trying to undermine. Also, all fat people are not nice with a ""good sense of humour"", this is as HUGE stereotype. I am fat, unpleasant and not funny.",2005
7,"""Shallow Hal"" is a mix of a very sweet and earnest love story with a comedy that often doesn't really work. I was won over by the fantasy love element and I do think it has more appeal than it doesn't. The idea that the titular character Hal (Jack Black) is a shallow guy who gets hypnotized into seeing women as they are inside instead of what they look like on the outside. He begins falling in love with Rosemary (Gwyneth Paltrow), a fat woman that has a big heart.",2015
10,"'Shallow Hal' proves the genius of the Farrelly brothers. Instead of taking the downhill route of following their own imitators ('American Pie(s), Road Trip etc), they create this brilliant comedy that takes the genre to a new dimension. (Note: They DID try to get into that gross out comedy race though, partially with 'Me, Myself and Irene' which failed in so many ways).",2003
10,"What more could you want? Great cast, funny lines, and a movie with some real depth. It's one of those chick-flicks that is bearable for even guys because of it's humor and the fact that it doesn't get too cheesy and when it does, they don't make the scenes last forever with unbearable lines and over-the-top romance.",2010
7,"A frustrating film in a way. I was hugely disappointed in it for a long while, but as the film progressed I kept wondering if my disappointment was merely a product of my unfair expectations. That's probably the case. I expect a daring comedy from the Brothers Farrelly, but Shallow Hal is surprisingly low-key. It doesn't go for easy laughs, as it easily could have done. The plot concerns a looks-obsessed guy (Jack Black) who is hypnotized into seeing the inner beauty of others. He falls in love with a fat woman who appears to him as Gwyneth Paltrow. When the film came out, a lot of people complained that this was terrible; he only loves her because he is attracted to Gwyneth Paltrow, not the fat incarnation that appears in only a couple of shots in the first 90 minutes of the film. But these people didn't really stick around for the payoff in the third act. What's so surprising about this film is how emotionally involving it is. A lot of this is due to Gwyneth Paltrow, who actually gives one of her best performances. But fans of the Farrelly Brothers, as I am myself, will not be shocked to find that emotional center. It was there in both Kingpin and There's Something About Mary. It's just as fun when the Brothers are mean-spirited, however, as they were in Me, Myself, & Irene and, even better, the unfairly maligned Dumb and Dumber. The serious themes are really on full display here, though. The Brothers have a true and touching affection for physical outsiders. I still wish that they wouldn't have forsaken comedy so much, though. I suppose the only jokes would have been fat jokes, but maybe not. Jason Alexander provides almost all of the good laughs. We wonder why he and Jack Black are so mean about the looks of others when they aren't especially gorgeous themselves. Some people are still asking how such a man as Jason Alexander can be so shallow in this film, but they, as I've said before, didn't stick around until the end. This film may improve on repeat viewings, as it was bothering me for a long while. 7/10.",2003

Dad 2008) So, I watch this movie and get 2 great experiences out of it. #1 laughing until you have a stomach ache,tears are rolling down my cheeks & my face face hurts. #2 reminds me of my dad and how much he loved the movie..at dinner my dad would always throw one-liners from the movie at you and your food would go flying out of your mouth from laughing so hard. Gweneth Paltrow plays a great role as a large woman in the movie. Jack Black is hilarious, he has a really big heart in the role he plays. I love Shallow Hal and I recommend anyone to watch Shallow Hal if you're having a good or bad day. Laughter is the best medicine and sitting on the couch watching Shallow Hal will bring you much laughter. Enjoy watching Shallow Hal and be ready for the belly laugh aches, tears rolling down your cheeks and face laughter pain. I love this meaningful comedy. 10☆",2016
9,"From the posters and trailers, you'd expect the Farrelly Brothers to be crude and offensive with this kind of material but it really isn't. It has a much deeper message than it appears. It knows when to be funny and knows when to be serious. Why so many people disliked it and why critics panned it is totally beyond me!",2015
10,"This is one of the better, if not the best, of the brother's movies.  It's smart in it's plot and premise, and it's challenging in it's characters. But while their movies seem to move positively in one direction, in story and maturity, it seems to move downhill in being funnier than their last efforts.  And the movie sacrifices plenty of big laugh out scenes for a really smart story, and supplies just enough laughter without over doing it, unlike EARlier works (Dumb and Dumber - which seemed it's only purpose was to make you laugh).",2001
10,This is a very funny movie with a great message. It's a bit of a departure for the Farrelly Brothers. They've created a movie with a lot of heart. A film that women will love as much as their bathroom humored boyfriends and husbands do. Go see it with someone you love.,2001
10,"I think that this movie was a great one to hire out and watch. I watched this a few times and it still didn't get old. It's a great movie and you just don't see lots of movies like this. It's packed full of all sorts of things that make this a good movie. Here's a few things it has comedy, warmth, good storyline, it's re-watchable,got a moral, and it's based around what life is really like in the whole relationship thing (well for some people). I'm giving it a 10 out of 10 and I recommend it for anybody that is around 13 or 15 years old people and above. If want a good movie to watch, take a look at this.",2005
10,"It seems to me that the prevalent objections (flimsy at that) by most to this movie is how offensive and hypocritical it is. Ok so it's a bit thin on consistency and not strictly politically correct, but hey that's what having a sense of humour is all about. Consider the guy with spina bifida, do you think that the Farrelly brothers made up every joke in his script?, of course not, these are probably lines he uses every day to help him keep his disability in perspective and enjoy down-to-earth relationships with others (at least I hope he does, as that is what every mature, well adjusted and truly confident person must be able to do no matter what the scale of imperfection they have, and incidentally something that those with greater disabilities have generally learned to develop much quicker in life than the often seemingly perfect paragons of beauty in society who're always checking their face in the mirror to spot the first sign of a wrinkle or whether their butt looks big in their outfit) and if not, I can't imagine he would allow those jokes to be said of him in a movie that gets worldwide distribution and not in everyday life. And from those people I think we can learn an important lesson because whether we want to accept it or not, no matter how beautiful we are, at some stage our physical attributes will decay, and the longer we prolong acceptance of this fact the longer we delay the agony of the paralysing insecurity that only grows stronger as our bodies grow weaker and is an intrinsic result of placing greater importance on aesthetic qualities. And the movie demonstrated that beautifully through the juxtaposing of Walt's genuine contentment with Mauricio's ever growing obsession with his receding hairline.",2002
2,"It's a nice thought experiment. How would you perceive the people around you if all you could see was their inner beauty? How clearly would it demonstrate we mostly judge people based on their looks, clothing, make-up and style. Unfortunately Hollywood has managed to use this premise and ruin it in Shallow Hal. It may seem to be a filmed version of exactly that experiment, yet is isn't once you think about it. It's not our shallow lead character only sees Rosemary's inner beauty, he is mind-tricked into seeing inner beauty translated into a hot and sexy package. So after all he is not wooing Gwynneth Paltrow because of her great personality, he is still chasing his usual hare, today's ideal in looks, who also happens to be a nice person. Duhh! THINK! In fact, this movie boils down to shallow jokes about fat people, like huge knickers and such, where the source of many of the corny jokes lies in the fact the audience know how fat his dream girl really is, a fact which he is oblivious to. And of course, in the end, when he 'wakes up' he cannot but conclude Rosemary is still who he wants to be with. So, lucky nice and fat people, there is hope after all. All you have to hope for is a blind or hypnotised goof ball who cannot see you are fat, and then, maybe you'll get lucky if this period lasts long enough. Be honest, would you have liked Rosemary (kind of a boring goodie two shoes gal if you ask me) if you had to constantly watch let's say Roseanne Arnold (Barr) play that exact same character? It amazes me how many people apparently don't see the hypocrisy in this flick and don't even feel their intelligence is abused here. Besides this stupidity the film just isn't funny, it hardly made me laugh. In a nutshell: trash it. Waste of your time and intelligence. 2/10",2007

And if that's what you're hoping for, you certainly won't be disappointed; because that's exactly what you get in `The Mummy Returns,' written and directed by Stephen Sommers. The story begins in Egypt, where Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) and his wife, Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) discover an ancient bracelet that had once belonged to a warrior known as `The Scorpion King (The Rock),' who, back in the day, had sold his soul to the god, Anubis, for control of his armies and domination of the world.  Now, it seems, The Scorpion King's resurrection is imminent, and if he succeeds and once again raises the armies of Anubis, he could very well take over or destroy the world.  Followers of Im-Ho-Tep (Arnold Vosloo), however, who are privy to this information as well, decide to resurrect their dark leader so that he can face The Scorpion King, defeat him, take control of Anubis' armies and conquer the world himself, putting them in control.  But the key to the whole plan lies with who has control of the bracelet at the time of The Scorpion King's resurrection.  And the O'Connells have taken it back home with them to London. ",2001

I've watched it about twenty times since then, and as many people know, this movie does not get boring or less funny after watching it numerous times, in fact, I think it gets more and more thrilling each time. I began hoping for a sequel to be released, and when I heard that one was in the making, I was relieved that they weren't going to end this great storyline with just one film. When ""The Mummy Returns"" was finally released in theaters, it didn't recieve very many good reviews right away. I was dissapointed because I didn't understand how Stephen Sommers could direct such a great movie classic and then totally botch a promising sequel. I let the reviews get to me and I didn't see the movie while in the theaters. I waited until this past weekend to watch TMR on pay-per-view not expecting much due to the bad reviews, but I soon found out that, boy, were some of those critics wrong.",2001
7,"The Mummy Returns is maybe a step above the first one. The action is non-stop, and it does manage, for the most part, to rouse the audience, or at least me. The good guys are likable. Brendan Fraser is where he belongs. Rachel Weisz is beautiful. John Hannah amuses as Jonathan, and Freddie Boath manages not to annoy as Alex, the kid. He's pretty good as a smart-mouthed brat. The bad guys are, for the most part, fun to hate. Im-Ho-Tep is a good villain. Maybe he isn't given enough to do here, but he's still cool. Patricia Valazquez is a real stunner as his love interst, Anck-Su-Namun. She's probably the best thing about the film. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje was good as Lock Nah, the main henchman. Perhaps the weakest part of the film is the Rock as the Scorpion King. The narration during the film's prologue is not nearly as good as it would be if we were watching the story develop. The Scorpion King is basically a boring character. His computer-animated doppleganger at the film's climax is neat, but it would have been better if there were some feelings towards that character.",2001

The total lack of effort in creating an interesting story and translating it onto film was beyond my comprehension as to why movies are made. This embodies everything that a film should not be... a story that serves no purpose either to itself or to the audience, the lack of interesting characters (because who really cared about what happened to any of them throughout the movie?), and senseless action that didn't even drive the plot (oh look, here comes another tidal wave with the dude's face in it for no reason). The Mummy Returns just goes to show how technology, which is suppose to enhance the visual aspect of an actual story, has been manipulated so that movies nowadays are only about how cool stuff looks onscreen without taking any interest to the film itself. And on top of that, this movie's visual effects weren't even good. It just looked like Brenden Fraser in a cheap cartoon. This kind of modern raping of the cinema has most likely ruined the minds of the mass viewers. Aside from the fact that it grossed $200 million dollars, which shows how tasteless movies like this have made us, it really isn't worth it once we realize how far behind this will put us in ever going back to making quality movies again.",2001

This one is very funny and keeps you entertained all the way through. The music is superb as well, it is also nice that the main cast returns as well as 92 percent of the crew! At first I was not sure of Freddie Boath but as soon as I saw the first scene he was in I knew that if a child of that age can act that well, the so can all the adults.

Well the bad news about the sequel is that it suffers from the same problem multiplied by ten. Witness the opening prologue of massed armies fighting , an oasis appearing from nowhere and the scorpian king`s army overrunning a city all of which might have looked good on paper but on screen is badly executed due to some really apalling CGI . I don`t know what it is about this type of cinema technology but think of all the films where it`s been used in set pieces that fail to convince ( ESCAPE FROM LA , DIE ANOTHER DAY etc ) and watching it used in THE MUMMY RETURNS  left me shaking my head wondering why directors and FX maestros haven`t been able to improve upon it .

Also, The Rock (even though his only line was in Ancient Egyptian) was still pretty solid. After an intense war scene, we finally arrive on the O'connells. Rick (Brendan Fraser) is now a family man. his son, Alex, shows as much strength and warmth that both Evy and Rick have. Throughout the film, the relationship within the family grew and amassed to that of an odd family. The film doesn't slow down yet, we are then treated to beautiful sets that have you believe they actually were in Egypt all those years ago.

It had everything you could want from a movie minus some underdeveloped character personalities but that film ROCKS even until this day and age. Part two was good though not as the original. The third installment: Terrible. Where was the adventure? Where was the excitement? Where was the suspense? Where was the danger? Drained of all the qualities of what made the first one so memorable. This could be blamed primarily on the director, Joe Johnston, who made that box-office bomb The Rocketeer nineteen years ago. What more can be said? At least the special effects were good; the fight between the T-Rex and Spinosaurus and the scene with the Pterodactyls but the plot was basically nonexistent and the acting was wooden and lifeless with no sense of conveying believability. And what's with the ""theory on raptor intelligence"" part? Were they assuming that raptors were smarter than birds and primates? One needs only to read various books on dinosaurs to find out. Seriously I don't expect movies to educate audiences but a little research wouldn't have hurt. I first saw this on opening day expecting more action, adventure, suspense, danger, and terror. Yet I got a lot less bang for the buck. A fine example on what happens when you switch directors mid franchise.",2008
1,"Spoilers warning :Jurassic Park, the first episode, was simply innovative, amazing, intelligent, and great. The Lost World was, let's say, bad.  But this is different from the two first chapters. Let me explain. This is the (very simple and stupid) story of a young boy doing some kind of parachute with a friend of his parents over Isla Sorna (the island where the story of The Lost World happened).  But with some amazing coincidences and unpredictable events (do you feel the sarcasm?), they crash on the island. Then, 8 weeks later (that's a long time to survive, on a near island) the parents pay Alan Grant to come with them save their son on the island. Don't you think the story is stupid? Don't you think this is gratuitous reason to go on an island and get eaten by dinosaurs...This is stupid to the extreme...seriously.  But, not only they have a crap-head scenario, but they also have special effects that are really not as good as the first two's.  I couldn't recognize the raptors, because teh dinosaur models are different and cheaper, and also, the dinosaurs are so fake sometimes, it's evident...the illusion isn't really there.  There are new species of dinosaurs, but the only T-Rex you see lasts only one minute.  But the most stupid point of the film, making it a possible winner at the Razzies fest, is the NEW intelligence of the dinosaurs...they communicate like humans (they don't speak, but it almost sounds like that sometimes), they look at each other, they trap humans...this is awfully stupid...and especially in the dinosaur fight, one of them kills the other by holding his head and breaking his neck...and why don't they eat the humans they kill?  The acting isn't so good, William H Macy is real bad and fake, like Tea Leoni...some awful one-liners, too predictable to be true...really.  The action is so brief, you can't enter into it, there is no stress, no suspense...and the movie has a running time of 85 minutes...plain bad. Overall, stupid story, bad acting, sucky scenario, lame action, no plot, no suspense, just a sell-out under the Jurassic Park title. 2/10",2001

1,"If the first of this seemingly interminable series was rather far-fetched, at least it didn't push to the extremes of absurdity (well, maybe not more than a few times); Jurassic Park III does practically from the start. Dinosaurs and pterosaurs are constantly depicted exhibiting traits that might be believable in primates, dog packs or even domesticated animals but would be ridiculous to attribute to reptiles; the writers go so far as to mention the ""alpha male"" of a pack of large herbivores - I guess that makes it sound more ""authentic""... Even in the original movie such behavior strained credibility past the breaking point on a few occasions, such as having a dinosaur burst through solid walls as if it recognized what a wall is and anticipated what would be on the other side - was that a tyrannosaurus or Godzilla? How many wild animals has anyone ever seen demonstrate such behavior? With each movie the 'raptors become more and more fiendishly clever; by the time V or VI rolls out (probably on direct-to-video), you might almost expect to hear one of them say, ""I am your father!""",2004

I have a special place in my heart for Steven Spielberg's one-two punch of Jurassic Park and The Lost World. Both films represent, to me, the absolute zenith of blockbuster filmmaking. Smart writing, endearing characters, and a savory buffet of craftsmanship, are what made those films soar. For the third Jurassic Park movie, the directorial torch was passed to Joe Johnston. The result is a film that seems like it comes from another universe. Jurassic Park 3 is nowhere near the level of the first two Jurassic Park movies, and I suppose for those less enthusiastic about the series, that may be a dealbreaker. For me? Well, I was able to get past it. The clear step down in quality may take some getting used to (maybe even a couple of viewings), but I found that once I made peace with that fact, what I was left with was a breezy little summertime thrill ride.

The island looks like one big sound stage split in several pieces, and the actors involve look like they are sleep walking in their parts. The dinosaurs in this movie are a little too computer generated for there own good, and the new dinosaur looks like a man in a rubber suit.

The only decent thing about the movie as a whole is the facts that it's shorter than its predecessors so you don't have do sit there in agony for too long.",2003
1,"I'm a father of two children. Two Children who can sit quietly though the worse television known to man. Sponge Bob, Pokemon, etc, and still find some kind of entertainment value to them with a curiosity that can't stop traffic.  When I put this movie in my DVD player, I thought that this will be like the other movies in the series, Good enough to keep the kids quite for a while, and good enough for me to sit by and enjoy myself. Boy I was wrong and my family and I paid for it dearly. There is no other way to describe this movie other than the word Horrible, and I think that's even too nice a word for this piece of cinematic garbage.  I can't begin to tell you on how bad this film was, and I'm not exaggerating this fact. This movie has one unbelievable scene of stupidity after another, and it's about Dinosaurs of all things. The acting is so bad that to even call it amateurish is a slap in the face of working actors every where.  William H Macy, who is a true actors actor, is even bad in this film and I like almost ever thing he has ever done. To make a movie of this nature look so bad has to be in itself a feat that has to garner some kind of award because movie like this has always have had some kind of entertainment value to it. The worse the movie is, the better the laugh factor is, and this movie HAS NONE OF THAT.  Even the CGI effects look like crap, and that's the movie's main selling point.",2003
5,"I am a big Crichton fan and I did NOT appreciate this movie. For starters, there was no novel for them to base it off of (even though they wouldn't have followed the novel very well.) Second, the writer obviously knew very little about the subject he wrote about seeing as the paleontologists talk in layman terms throughout the entire film, not giving it the scientific facts that add to its predecesor. Thirdly, and this one isn't all THAT big of deal, but the graphics and robot interaction was terrible. When they changed from one to the other, it wasn't very gradual or subtle. The skin looked way too plastic on the robot. This film should've been made by the original creators, then maybe it would've been better.",2003
1,"Horrible, and really cheap looking sequel to Jurassic Park and The Lost World does not even do the title any justice with a laid brain plot involving a lost boy, and two annoying parents who you want to see eaten. Sam Neil is wasted with thankless role and The special effects are a major let down. The movie is so bad, that you really want to sue the makers of this crap for liable, and for every thing in their pockets.  I don't know what went wrong but I hope they bring back the people who made The original two movies for the (hopefully) Last Jurassic Park film.",2003
1,"This movie is on my list of the top 20 worst movies I have ever seen. There is no suspense, no updated computer animation, and a horrible ending. There were a lot of holes in the story line that were obvious to an average movie goer. If you are curious, I would recommend that you wait for it to come out on video.",2001
1,"I can't really say much other than this is a far cry from the original. After the lacklustre JP2 - The Lost World, I was expecting something better here but instead I was greeted with incredibly bad special effects and blatantly annoying characters. The whole film lacks direction and suspense and in the end I was hoping for the CG dinosaurs to rip the cast to pieces to prevent a fourth installment. I give it 1 out of 10, seriously.",2001
1,"What was it that made the original Jurassic Park so amazing...The simplicity, the wonder, the amazement, and of course the suspense. I have seen a lot of movies, and when I say a lot that's exactly what i mean. I have never seen a more suspenseful moment in all of those films than the simple thumping of the approaching T-Rex and the soft rippleing of the water in the glass...what made this scene so suspenseful you may ask? The simplicity. You know it's coming and the charactors know it too. In the third film, the director (Joe Johnson) relied far too much on dinosaurs jumping out to startle the audience. Now these moments are good and all, but the sad part is that out of all of the moments like this in JP3 the one that made me jump the highest was a suspended bridge falling apart.",2001
1,"This was by far the worst movie I have ever seen.  The first installment had the audience believing that dinosaurs could possibly walk the earth if enough DNA was found.  The second made it slightly more possible with its analytical portions in the exposition.  This third film (and I use that term VERY loosely) did a magnificent job of taking reality and dashing it to bits.  It had all the audience insulting humor and predictable plot of a bad 1950s B-horror.  It's no surprise that they couldn't get Spielberg to do this film; the script was not only full of holes, but also totally coincidental.  Plot points that are not explained.  Pointless characters. Furthermore, there are parts of this movie that contradict the first 2 films!  As far as the animation, the original JP of the 90s was far superior.  The close shots of these dinosaurs were about as impressive as the hand puppets sold with fast-food meals that came out with the original. Overall, a horrible film.",2001
1,"This movie was a total tragedy from the very beginning.  So many scenes were so terribly done, with very fake backdrops and poor audio use.  The computer animated graphics definatley lacked the brilliance of the first 2 movies. It's like they wern't even trying with this one.  I thought that it might be okay that it was really short, because it was a thriller type movie and that way you wouldn't leave being absolutely worn out.  I was wrong with that assumption.  It was so short you had no time to get involved with the characters, it doesn't give you any time to have any kind of feelings for them.  Dr. Grant it taken back to Hell on earth and he's nowhere near as upset as you would think he should be.  There is no climax what so ever. The movie just kind of ends, with a short raptor seen and there we have it, you're going home mad that you've wasted $6.50 and an hour and 20 minutes of your life.  This movie was basically done for the money that they thought they could make off of it.  There is no art or personal touch to it at all.",2001
1,"To sum it up, I actually wanted more characters to get eaten. They were poorly directed and annoying. The dinosaurs - sure, they looked pretty real, but the scare factor the trailers seemed to entice weren't even there. Why do they keep adding to an old franchise? Pretty soon, even the food supplies on Isla Sorna are going to get old and then what are the stranded people going to eat?",2001
1,"This is with out a doubt, one of the worst films ever made.  It's Mystery Science Theater 3000 material at it's finest. It does not have the Heart or soul that made the first two enjoyable, and it's bad in every way. The acting, the directing, and don't even mention a plot because it does not have one. The score of the film is even bad, so bad in fact that It almost destroys what John Williams Did with the first two films.  ",2001
8,"Derek Zoolander is stupid. So is his movie. But by no means, is Zoolander humorless. Directed by and starring Ben Stiller, Zoolander is a very funny movie, if you know what to expect. Based on a character that Stiller created for the 1996 VH1 Fashion Awards, Derek Zoolander was originally intended to satirize the fashion industry. The movie does no less and as a result, has received some very negative patron reviews. Audiences went into Zoolander expecting another Ben Stiller, Meet the Parents-type comedy, and when they got an offbeat movie about the fashion industry's plot to assassinate the prime minister of Malaysia, they didn't know how to react. To enjoy Zoolander, one has to forget all expectations and see the movie for what it is supposed to be: ridiculous.",2001
8,"This has to be a movie that people would either laugh their butt off watching, or turn it off and never finishing it because it was so stupid. Fortunately, as someone who loves absurd humor, I was entertained by it. Yes, it's one of the dumbest films you'll ever see, but it's supposed to be stupid, a satire on the shallow people and world of male fashion models.",2007
10,A really great take on the modelling world. Each Time I watch it I see something else that makes me howl with laughter. Out of all the Stiller/Wilson collaborations this is definitely the funniest. There is so much going on in the film and I love the way all the celebs join in on the joke. Zoolander has a great soundtrack a very humorous plot and is light enough to enjoy whatever the mood.,2005
9,"I gave this movie a 9/10 for this reason, if you have seen the previews, you know what you are going to see. You are going to see a movie that is exactly the kind of humor that the preview TELLS and SHOWS you it contains. They don't expect Oscars, and arent even trying for them. This movie is not to be taken seriously, its for FUN, people. The movie's main characters did great jobs, and had good charisma between them, there were tons of other actors putting in small bits (some of which were amazingly funny, I laughed out loud in a few parts, and I almost never do that). There were some truly funny moments, moments I found much funnier than I thought the film would be. When I told friends and family I saw it they all said, `You did?' when I said I liked it they said with even more incredulity, `You did?!' because I don't like certain kinds of stupid humor. I liked the Three Amigos, but hated Austin Powers. Potty humor doesn't do it for me. But this movie was surprisingly witty and funny without thinking it had to be disgusting to be humorous. There were a few parts I could have lived without, gladly, but overall you get what you think you are going to get, and more!",2001
9,"When Zoolander came out, I remember big deal plugs that were made for this film by the media. The movie, after all, is poking fun at entertainment, in particular, the fashion and model industry. This was a hilarious take on it, and Zoolander, our main character, is stupidly lovable. Ben Stiller proves once again his flexibility with his comedic acting. Just watch 'Meet the Parents'and this, you'll think it's 2 different actors. Showing you how much work Ben can do, he also helped write and produce the movie. Owen Wilson usually ends up in a movie with Ben, and he's hilarious too. And of course Will Ferrell is always a riot. Read the Plot Outline in the details, there's not much to it. But you don't watch movies like this for incredible story lines, do you?",2004
8,"In Entertainment Weekly, Ben Stiller described this feature-length adventure of the moronic male model he created for the VH1 Fashion Awards as ""MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE meets EYES OF LAURA MARS."" Me, I can sum it up in two words:  ""AUSTIN Posers.""  No, better yet, I'll boil it down to one word: ""endearing.""  That's right, endearing!  As lighthearted as it is lightheaded, this daffy spoof of conspiracy thrillers and the mad, mod world of male models and other hipsters has a surprising undercurrent of sweetness to it. Star/director/co-writer/co-producer Stiller plays dopey Derek Zoolander as a gentle, essentially kind-hearted naif under his hip veneer. The same is true of Owen Wilson, putting his twang and quirky humor to good use as Derek's rustic yet hippy-dippy rival-turned-ally Hansel. I suspect folks will like ZOOLANDER even better on DVD, since there are tons of hilarious extended scenes and deleted scenes as well as the original Zoolander TV sketches that Stiller & Co. did for VH1. As Derek says in the voiceover intros on the DVD menu, the ZOOLANDER disc is a wonderful introduction to ""the world of DiviDuh""! :-)",2002
10,"Not a favorite on the first viewing, when it premiered, this movie is - I have to admit it now - hysterical. Don't forget that it's a parody, it's quirky, completely ridiculous, insane & over the top and yes, people in it act stupidly. I'm not a fan of Ben Stiller, I haven't enjoyed any other movies of his, but this is spot on. I say justice has been done: it's been finally revealed that stupidity knows no gender when it comes to the fashion world, and it comes in epic proportions. ",2012
10,"The complex world of the male modeling profession, including the inherent rivalries and the significant impact the industry has had on history is explored and revealed in `Zoolander,' a brilliant comedy directed by and starring the versatile Ben Stiller.  With chiseled features that bespeak the best of Michelangelo, as well as an arsenal of three `looks,' preeminent of which is the riveting `Blue Steel,' Derek Zoolander (Stiller) is poised to win the coveted VH-1 Male Model of the Year Award for an unprecedented fourth year in a row.  But this year-- for the first time-- he has a rival, a newcomer, who just may be able to usurp his title:  the charismatic and popular Hansel (Owen Wilson), who-- with chiseled features of his own-- has burst upon the scene only this year and threatens to steal Zoolander's thunder in one fell swoop.  And as if this wasn't enough for the seemingly (until now) invulnerable Zoolander to have on his vapid mind, a reporter for Time Magazine, Matilda Jeffries (Christine Taylor-- Stiller's real-life wife), has written an in-depth article about him in which the true nature of the man behind the Adonis is objectively and succinctly revealed, and it's scheduled to hit the streets the week of the Awards.  Suffice to say it's a full plate for Derek Zoolander, male model, who-- unbeknownst to him-- has yet an even greater personal vexation awaiting, which involves a sinister plot and the Prime Minister of Malaysia.  The Prime Minister of Malaysia? And what-- you may ask-- does that have to do with the male modeling profession?  Well, it's just that kind of movie...",2001
7,Derek (Ben Stiller) and Hansel (Owen Wilson) are the worlds greatest two models. And nobody in the world could play them quite like Stiller and Wilson. Stiller was also a writer and the director of Zoolander and knows how to put together a movie. ,2005
8,"Zoolander is definitely one of my favorite comedies. It is a feel-good, cleverly-written film that will leave a majority of viewers satisfied. The acting is great, and the story flows well--overall a very solid comedy. ",2013
7,"""Zoolander"" is stupid, but it's stupid in every way: its characters, its plot, and its jokes, but that starts adding up to fun. I will admit that I laugh most times I watch it, sometimes I groan because of the stupidity, but I usually have a smile on my face.",2010
10,"By the exaggerated tagline, ""3% body fat, and 1% brain activity,"" I just knew that Zoolander was going to be smart and funny. And, it was. If you can rise above the literal visual interpretation to the gasoline pump fight, you'll find it too, has an underlying educational, or at least, helpful message. The characterizations of good guy versus bad guy are whimsical, creative, colorful, and funny. Derek Zoolander, (Ben Stiller) is Ben's wonderfully exaggerated version of the male model, one who is offering his best attempt to be ""Balls Models"" 4th year in a row, model of the year. Sadly, he loses to Hansel, (Owen Wilson) a sweet blue, green, star eyed, soft lined, model. At the loss, quirky, carefree and complex, Derek questions his reflection in a puddle of water, ""Who Am I?"" In search of an answer to his question, he returns home to the coal mines of New Jersey, where his generally reluctant father, Larry Zoolander ( John Voight) and what looks to be his two evidently, (one Judah Friedlander) inarticulate brothers, reside. But, it is Derek's agent, Maury Ballstein (Jerry Stiller) who encourages him to return to New York, so that Derek can take on the assignment, as model for Mugato's (Will Ferrell) ""Derelicte,"" campaign. Maury is passionate and sincerely wants for his models to succeed, at making a living, in modeling. Mugato is obsessed with having Derek assassinate Malaysia's prime minister, Hassan (Woodrow W. Asai), one with a fondness for fashion and vogue, and a desire to increase pay standards, in the production industry. Derek takes the job, but little does he know that Mugato's black leathered assistant, Katinka, (Milla Jovovich) will be leading him into a day spa, that is more like a torture chamber, one designed to brainwash him into assassinating Malaysia's leader. Matilada Jeffries, (Christine Taylor) a reporter for Time, assigned to reporting on fashion events, will soon find herself in the midst of discovering a personal life, originating from her professional one. And fortunately, Hansel, is more than a competitor to Derek, but a friend, who saves both Derek and the leader of Malaysia, from an untimely death.",2005
10,"Zoolander was honestly one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  I cannot account for the fact that the guy who wrote the summary didn't laugh!!  That was hilarious, sure the movie did not expose the world of male modeling or anything but it didn't set out to do that.  So it shouldn't be judged for things it did not set out to accomplish.  It should be admired for what it was able to do, make everyone laugh and tell a good and entertaining story.  Good stories were very hard to come by this season, can we say Planet of the Apes and The Mummy Returns?.",2001
10,"Very imaginative and silly comedy starring Ben Stiller. Stiller plays a world-renowned male fashion model who is brainwashed to kill the new Malaysian Prime Minister. The short description of the plot may make the movie sound stupid, but it is a goofy and light-hearted comedy that is worth watching. You will either love it or hate it. Exceptional performances by Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, Will Ferrell, and Jerry Stiller.",2001
10,"This movie may have had somewhat of a weak plot (which is part of the humor in itself) but the actions of all the characters in the movie are hilarious. Ben Stiller plays a somewhat 'dumb' (putting it lightly) male model. He's been hypnotized to kill the prime minister of Malaysia. All the characters are great and the humor is non-stop. I laughed in the car on the way home. So go see it ""You freakin' idiot!""",2001
10,"This movie is amazing. I have fun every time I watch this movie. Everything about it is funny. It's almost indescribable how ridiculous (ridiculous as in really really goofy/silly) Zoolander is. I'm not big on Ben Stiller's work. I disliked both ""Meet the"" films, and I didn't like ""Dodgeball"". But he was...amazing in this movie.",2006
10,"Zoolander makes no sense whatsoever. But the jokes are hilarious, and you will never forget this movie. Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller), an immensely famous yet immensely dumb male model at the end of his career, is brainwashed to kill the prime minister of Malaysia, by one of the only people who never hired him, Mugatu (Will Ferrell). So he needs the help of TIME reporter Matilda Jeffries (Christine Taylor), and rival model Hansel (Owen Wilson) to help keep him from destroying the prime minister. With great performances from all the actors, including Jerry Stiller as Maury Ballstein, Derek's mentor, this will be remembered as a classic (at least by me)!",2014
1,"After spending today reviewing all of my favorite movies, I had to pump out a review for the heinously bad Ben Stiller vehicle, Zoolander. Previously liking the principal cast of this film, (including Owen Wilson and Will Ferrel), I was more than a little dissapointed after seeing what a clumsy mess Zoolander turned into. The concept wasn't great to begin with, but such terrible execution on the tried and true Dumb and Dumber formula turned this film into an example of what not to do in a comedy. There are a few moments that may cause tiny giggles, but these moments are also mind numbingly dumb. Proceed with caution... this movie sucks.",2003
10,I loved this film.,2004
9,"With 'The Royal Tenenbaums', Wes Anderson turns his lens to the American family, warts and all. The Tenenbaums are a dysfunctional family  the parents have been separated for decades, and Royal (Gene Hackman) is a disbarred attorney who has long since moved out of the family's enormous house (in an unnamed city of course). The children, all geniuses and overachievers in their own way, are then raised by Etheline (Angelica Houston), an archeologist. Chas (Ben Stiller) is a financial wizard, Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow), is adopted and was a published playwright at 11, and Richie (Luke Wilson) is a tennis prodigy. We are provided the family history at the start of the film, then are introduced to the family 22 years later. Chas is still a financial wizard, but, having lost his wife in a plane accident is now the paranoid father of two small sons. Margot is married to Raleigh St. Clair (Bill Murray, who is basically Anderson's muse), is depressed and hasn't written in years, and Richie, after having a nervous breakdown on the tennis court a couple of years earlier is traveling the world by boat. Still hanging around is Eli (Owen Wilson) a long-time family friend from across the street who is now a literature professor and successful novelist. Etheline is being wooed by her accountant, Henry (Danny Glover) and when Royal gets wind of this, he embarks on a bid to win his family back after not speaking with them for years.",2004
9,"I think if someone tries to watch a Wes Anderson film, they have to have a certain kind mind to understand the real meaning of them. After being awed by the Royal Tenenbaums, I left with a certain kind of joy that only a great film can give me. It's like flying an electric kite, it's that hard of a buzz. As I began my travel down the stairs of the theater, I heard this couple talking about how stupid the movie was, and how they are going to ask for a refund. I suddenly smiled, because I hoped that they would get one. I think that I got something out of the film that they didn't. That inside the frames of the movie I felt like I was in good company and had a understanding for the material that they didn't.  What is so good about the Royal Tenenbaums?  The great detail in every frame, from the costumes (and they really are costumes)to the design of Chas, Margot, and Richie rooms and the house. This is brilliant film on every level, a delight for the senses and for the mind. This movie makes you think, and without giving too much away there is a lot of surprises that come from the characters dialogue and their past.  High kudos go to Luke Wilson, I loved his performance as the suffering Richie.  If you loved Rushmore, there is no doubt that you will love this film because it is at par with it, except that its a bit darker in tone.   I think its funny that way that people look at film, we each love or hate a film based on our own perception(and mind there are people who just watch film for entertainment). So if you have a complicated mind and you enjoy watching a challenging film, then the Royal Tenenbaums is for you. As for me, I plan on watching it again so I find more things to love about it. Thank you Wes Anderson, so much. You made laugh, you made me smile and I cried. A thousand times, thank you!",2001
10,"The Royal Tenenbaums, to put it shortly, is a weird movie. It is the story of a family longing for its heyday to return. It is the story of a man who wants to be accepted. It is a story of redemption, filled with small epiphanies and smaller details that make for excellent viewing. It takes delight in showcasing its brilliant characterizations and depictions of social oddities. Many will find it hard to relate to such strangers and therefore decline to revel in this film's cinematic glory. We can pity them.",2005
10,"I first saw this film on TV and have never seen a director quite like Wes Anderson displaying his outlook on life so expertly. He and Owen Wilson have created a family beyond dysfunctional.

Myself, I don't find it too accessible because his characters all decidedly inhabit their own particular universe. I found ""Rushmore"" and ""The Life Aquatic"" to be at the very least 'watchable' (I rate both 6/10... ) but I think the problem I had with TRT is that the two other films I mentioned had 'oddball' characters where you wouldn't expect to find them; a dysfunctional family unit is bound to have its unique members, because that's WHY they're dysfunctional! Family conflict isn't exactly a fresh theme, it's been done many times, so in the end it just felt like an excuse for the Wilsons to gather together their actor mates and get purposefully 'wacky'...",2006

I kept begging my wife to leave the theatre with me about three-quarters of the way through but even though she hated it,wanted to hold on just in case it picked up. It didn't. I was really trying to like this film but every time a story arc would begin,it would either end too soon or just lie flat with no real overall point to ANY of the movie. The talent pool is high-priced and while their acting wasn't bad,they can only do so much with a garbage script. A definite black mark on all of their careers.

Gene Hackman raising an alcoholic drink with a cheeky smile plastered across his face? Bill Murray? Both the Wilson brothers at the same time? Surely, this would be one of the funniest films of all time, with a cast like that, how could it fail? Well I have to hand it to the art designers and the hype machine because they fooled me completely, as The Royal Tenenbaums turned out to be one of those comedies that is ""off-beat,"" ""dark"" and ""intelligent,"" but forgets to be ""funny."" Still, I'm a bit of a glutton for punishment some times so I sat through the entire film and was rewarded for my perseverance with over two hours of utter tedium.

I see a lot of films and I am confident in my ability to pick up on subtle dark humour but come on this film is just awful. I really do think that sometimes its a case of emperors new clothes, some highbrow critics star saying how wonderfully clever and dark this film is and then when people start agreeing with them they probably snigger behind our backs. I have never left a film early but my god I wanted to in this one, this and unbreakable two lousy films praised across the board and I have no idea why.

Now this show just recycles old plots (at least two or three times) and now a days its not worth watching. The characters have been dumbed down and become really unlikable just for the sake of the ""plot"" if you can even call it that because some of the new episodes don't have plots the idiot characters just act like lazy morons (kinda like the writers) and mess something up that they the proceed to fix in 2 minutes of filler garbage and they never face any consequences for what they did. Butch Hartman should have ended this long ago while it still had some (very little) dignity know its gone on so long people have stopped watching it (and Nick in general) because of how boring and dull it has become. Also the dog and the baby should have NEVER been introduced they somehow managed to make the show worse than what it already was.",2014
8,"I used to watch this show everyday after school when I was a little kid back at the early 2000s and I loved it as much as anyone else. The animation is beautiful, the characters are likable especially Timmy and his godparents, Cosmo and Wanda. The humor is witty and funny at the same time and the story lines for the first few seasons are creative. Even the voice acting for the characters is pretty solid and entertained me throughout the show.",2012
1,"During the first 3 seasons Fairly Odd Parents was as tasty as hard candy, bright and sweet and addictive. Now it's as tasty as Pepto-Bismol. And unfortunately Pepto-Bismol is what you'll need after viewing the more recent episodes, where all the sweetness has been replaced by insults and violence resulting in no laughs. Cosmo, once one of the more endearing Nick characters, has devolved into an abusive unfunny cretin that the cast of Family Guy wouldn't even want to know. Timmy has become a selfish arrogant jerkwad that Bart Simpson would happily beat the snot out of (and given Timmy's snottiness, that would take a lot of beating). And poor Wanda...a real charmer who's become the victim of her husband and godchild, she's now labeled a ""nag"" for caring about the well-being of others. Plus Cosmo's stupidity causes pain to everyone else but he's never punished for it, nor does he learn any lessons. Which pretty much sums up Butch Hartman's attitude towards kids: they're crude, vulgar and not too bright. Thank god this crummy toon has been cancelled, along with Butch Hartman's darling, Danny Phantom. At least Butch got what he deserved - unlike Cosmo.",2006
5,"""The Fairly OddParents"" is the first animated TV show created by former writer and director on ""Johnny Bravo"" and ""Dexter's Laboratory"", Butch Hartman. It is also the 16th of Nickelodeon's Nicktoons, and the first spin-off of Nicktoon anthology series ""Oh Yeah! Cartoons"".",2011
1,"This show is such garbage, It's beyond me how anyone likes it.. Everything is always over the top, every 30 seconds the characters are either yelling or excited, there hasn't been a single moment that I've laughed while watching this.. The only reason I've watched the series is because my sisters love this show, but I cannot stand it..",2012
1,"I cannot stand this show! Has there ever been even one redeeming quality, one funny punchline, or one plot line that ""didn't"" make the average viewer want to drown himself in a bowl of soggy cornflakes? ",2008
1,"I believe that I have just witnessed the most awful mindless piece of tripe ever to disgrace modern era television. Each episode of this show I have seen consists of mindless rushed jokes that were old and way out dated long before the show ever first aired. Not only that but the animation and voice acting is tired and lazy despite containing some decent actors. Beyond this it will bring nothing to anyone, surprises me that this show has earned a 7! It is boring, unfunny, not entertaining and I know I keep saying this but MINDLESS it is dumb and not clever in the slightest! I urge you desperately to keep your selves and your kids away from this god awful mess that sums up kids television of the 200s in a nutshell. Pure utter rubbish! I would have given it a 0 but 1 is the lowest!",2013
1,"I'll start with the characters. Timmy Turner is a Grade-A brat. Instead of wishing that others(Such as his parents) would treat him with respect, he uses his fairy godparents to wish outlandish wishes and when he feels bad for them, they still treat him like crap. The show should have been renamed ""Everybody Hates Timmy"". Wanda nags and nags and nags and nags and actually admits on being a stereotypical nagging wife. Cosmo is so stupid he can't even multiply 2 by 2. Vicky is more like a child abuser than a baby sitter and Timmy's parents are no better. Seriously, Timmy's parents are such dummies. In fact, I'm guessing they're regretting having a kid of their own. Every character in this piece of crap shouts and screams constantly while they're talking and it annoys me very much! How can you not find that annoying?! I guess with all that shouting and screaming, this is suppose to be a cartoon where all the characters have Tourett Syndrome. Now, I'll move on with the animation. The animation is so tacky and stupid, it makes Looney Tunes Back in Action look like Who Framed Roger Rabbit. And what's with all the eyes moving this way and that way and the way they move around while they're talking? It looks like they're posing for the Oscars or for a Hollywood movie. And here's the part with the character design. Over-sized heads, square heads, cheesy artwork, gigantic feet, etc. The character design is never appealing, it makes Sheep in the Big City look like Eiichiro Oda's One Piece. Now, I'll finish with the jokes. The fart jokes, the puke jokes, and the burp jokes are all babyish and laughable. There's also the overdose of running gags(mostly started by Cosmo, the god-awful cartoon character of them all). Every time one person starts a gag(Here are a few examples, a scientist spits out coffee in reaction to a meteorite heading for Dimmsdale and flings his arms wildly as if he's drowning 'cause he's unable to scream; The Blubber Nuggets from Farmer Ahab; The Fun Box; Cosmo sucking his thumb like a baby after someone says ""Super Toilet""; the list goes on), it goes on and on and on like a freaking Energizer battery or a Fruit by the Foot fruit snack(Cosmo or another person would repeat the same joke until the end of the episode). Thank goodness this horrible cartoon series got canceled because 10 years of dealing with this steaming pile of horse diarrhea is enough... What's that? There's going to be a Fairly Odd Parents Christmas Special?! Pardon me. (Goes outside and screams. Comes back inside) If you want a cartoon that's jammed pack with crappy characters, cheesy animation, babyish jokes, and running gags that were repeatedly used again and again, this might be the one for you. If you want a cartoon that doesn't do anything that I mentioned earlier, you'll find it eventually.",2012
1,"Seriously, the fact that this show is so popular just boggles the mind. This show isn't funny, it isn't clever, it isn't original, it's just a steaming pile of bull crap. Let me start with the characters. The characters are all one-dimensional morons with loud, exaggerated voices that just sound like fingernails on a blackboard. The voice acting could've been better. Then there's the animation. MY GOD, it hurts my eyes just looking at it. Everything is too flat, too pointy, too bright, and too candy coated. Then there's the humor, or lack thereof. It's completely idiotic! They just take these B-grade jokes that aren't even that funny in the first place and then repeat them to death. They also throw in some pointless potty humor which sickens me. And finally, last and least, the music. It's just plain annoying. It sounds like it was composed on a child's computer and generates no emotion whatsoever. I wish there was a score lower than 1, I really do. This show seriously needs to be canceled. It's a show I try to avoid like the plague. Whenever I hear the theme song I immediately turn the TV off. If you've never watched this show then don't. Watch quality programming like The Simpsons or Futurama.",2008
3,"There are some redeeming qualities to this show. One is that the theme tune does have a decent melody. The show does have a nice premise. Also, I am probably in the minority, but I like Wanda. I like the fact she is caring, and is more a mother figure to Timmy. However, despite all this, I do not like this show, it isn't excrement but I do find it very annoying.",2009
1,*Spoilers and extreme bashing lay ahead*,2006
9,"OK, the first thing I have to say is that Fairly Oddparents is one of the best shows on Nick, (next to Spongebob) and has hysterically-funny characters. Comso is the best, because whatever he says is stupidly funny. I also think Timmy's dad is funny too. The fact that he and the the mom have no first names is really funny. Too bad this show is getting canceled. They could do so much more with it! Like make a theatrical movie, or something. Some of the new episodes did stink, because I think Fairly Oddparents got a new writer or something, but it is still a fun show to watch! I also think Jimmy Neutron and Spongebob are great show too!",2006
1,I really hate this retarded show. It SUCKS! big time and personally I think it is insulting to fairy kind - if you believe in fairies that is. I mean the people who had come up with such crap 'ought to have their heads examine huh? There is a LOT of craziness and stupidity in this show which are two of the things that I dispised and loathe in the WHOLE world; especially stupidity.,2008
8,FairlyOdd Parents is one of the few cartoons i still enjoy watching a lot. Comedy plays a big part in this cartoon and you'll find many little silly random things stitched into the interesting plots of the episodes. each episode has sort of like a few main random jokes or things that get used a couple of times through out the episode. its neat like that.,2006
5,"When I first saw this show, I thought it was a great show. It was entertaining, fun and has some lessons.From season 1 to the season with Sparky, but now, things have changed in a really bad way. The season that showed another character named Chloe took away everything great from before. I mean, Chloe isn't a horrible character by any means, it's just they made the show from fun to annoying.Timmy now is a dumb, arrogant,selfish,shallow and lazy moron. I know, he's kinda like that from the beginning, but here, he's now like a jerk. This is even worse than the episodes with the chosen one and the darkness which also stinks. These are only awful endless episodes with lame takes from Star Wars. I am really upset about these new episodes. The creators have really lost the fun.",2017
3,"The fact that people are seriously putting this thing on par with animated masterpieces such as The Simpsons is bad enough, but then there's the ridiculous amount of hardcore fans of this show (mostly nerdy adults who haven't yet learned how to grow up) who push this show as this hilarious and stunning cartoon. I tried watching it, and I guess it's an okay kids' show. It's no Simpsons or anything, but it's not terrible, either. It is, however, very overrated for what it is, full of corny jokes, immature antics and obnoxious characters. I can understand adults who enjoyed it as a kid perhaps still watching it for nostalgic value, but it's nowhere near the level of amazement that it's been dubbed with. I just personally found it stupid and I'd probably never view it again.",2017
9,BLOW / (2001) **** (out of four),2001
8,"Since not every film can be a great masterpiece, it only stands to reason that there are some which, as good as they are, will never be mentioned in the same breath as The Godfather. Blow happens to be one of those films. In today's market, where films are literally churned out with more attention paid to marketability than merit, it is no surprise that films of almost every subject are saturating the market. Even films about, or based upon, historical crime figures are a dime a dozen these days. The plus to this is that the ones that do come out have to do something special in order to be considered good.",2004
8,"The effects of lacking the fortitude and conscience to make the right choices in life are examined in `Blow,' directed by Ted Demme and starring Johnny Depp as George Jung, a young New Englander who decides early on that living week to week and barely being able to make ends meet is not the kind of life he wants.  George grew up in the 50s, in a decent, middle-class family, but was deeply affected by the fact that his father, Fred (Ray Liotta), worked his fingers to the bone as a plumber, sometimes fourteen hours a day, seven days a week, and it was never enough, especially for his mother, Ermine (Rachel Griffiths), who complained endlessly about not having enough money.  More than once she abandoned her family, only to be taken back every time upon her return by Fred, who adored her.  Then, in the late 60s, George, along with his childhood friend, Tuna (Ethan Suplee), moved to Southern California and quickly discovered the freedom of the beaches and a lifestyle conducive to his idea of paradise.  That `paradise' being anchored in the realization of the big, easy money to be made at the time selling marijuana; and for George, it was only the beginning, the on-ramp to the freeway that would ultimately take him to the top of his `profession,' and which was destined to define his life.  ",2001
8,"I don't understand why many people I talked to either thought the film was bad or mediocre.  Sure, it isn't a ""great"" movie, but when was the last time you saw 5 great movies in a row?  A great movie comes along once in a blue moon, depending on your definition of great.  I personally was very engaged in the plot.  Johnny Depp gives a tour-de-force performance, fully engaging himself in the character.  I'm sure he did lots of research on George Jung and tried to mimick his every mannerism, because this was far from a half-baked effort.  Then again, I don't ever recall Johnny Depp doing a movie where he didn't put his full enthusiasm into the role.  The movie has many tragic moments and many funny moments.  The film is a little over 2 hours long, but the time flew by in a breeze.  I was so enlightened that I'm anxious to do some research on the real George Jung.  I'm not a fan of Penelope Cruz, and they could've chosen a much better actress, but she's only in the film about 20 or 30 minutes, so she isn't given enough time to ruin the film.  Paul Reubens gives a surprisingly earnest performance as a flamboyant, bisexual hairdresser.  It's too bad he's caught up in all this controversy, because he seems to have sufficient range as an actor.  I loved hearing all the great classic rock songs in the soundtrack, and every time I watch the film the songs get stuck in my head and I start singing them for days on end.  ",2002
10,"I find this movie VERY GOOD! In fact, the end nearly brought me to  tears. This movie does something that shouldn't be, but it is. By the  end of the movie, you feel SO SORRY for a drug dealing thief. It's  amazing how they tell the story, and by the end you want to go see this  man and say how sorry you were. I believe that it's one of Johnny's  best roles and really makes you think some. This movie has been  underrated by many people because it's about drugs, but the story is  just a story, but the message it brings and the emotions it triggers,  are lasting. I recommend this movie to anyone that wants to see a Good  Film.",2004
10,"That statement was said by Denis Leary who, not surprisingly, co-produced this drug epic with Ted Demme who not only directs this film, but Leary's special No Cure for Cancer. Watching that special, I would've never expected a movie this good and serious, but it is. And unless a better film comes along this year, Blow might just be the best film of 2001.",2001
8,"`On your mark! Get set and blow!' And prepare yourself to one of the most provocative and entertaining films you will see all year. `Blow' stars Johnny Depp and is based upon the real life story of drug dealer George Jung. Depp's performance as Jung was outstanding and proves again why his outstanding diverse acting is all that is `cracked' up to be.  Ray Liotta was just as good as the trusting father. However, Penelope Cruz as the materialistic drug dealer wife was not a woman on top with her acting. The most surprisingly energetic performance was by Paul Reubens (a.k.a. Pee-Wee Herman) who was once again a master of his domain as the drug dealing homosexual middleman (in more ways than one). All in all, this is one `blow' that does the job right! **** Good",2001
10,"It feels wrong to be sympathetic toward a person who deals drugs for a living, but after watching this movie (being based on a true story)I have a completely different view of George Jung. The first time I watched it, I watched it because I'm a fan of Johnny Depp. I always felt he played his best role in ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,"" however, now it's hard to decipher which was better, his role as Raoul Duke, or George Jung?",2004
6,"Based on a true story of how the American cocaine market was founded, this is a lot more funky than I had expected. A thumpingly good soundtrack right from the start and Johnny Depp cruising in to be a convincingly laid-back big-shot - almost like a graduate from Boogie Nights. Penelope Cruz manages to be blisteringly erotic in a few well-crafted scenes and without removing a stitch of clothing. Later, instead of following the usual pattern of despair in the second half where most drug movies home in on drug dependency, Blow refreshingly focuses on the emotional losses suffered by the characters. A film that just about manages to be more than the sum of its parts, it would have made a nice sort of pre-quel to Traffic, but it stands alone in fine form. And it's moving rather than depressing.",2001
3,"I first saw Blow several years ago, and I loved it. Watching it again a couple of days ago my opinion changed dramatically. What made me change my mind? I think what made me like the film in the first place was its ""groovy feel"" and its realistic portraying of dope smuggling. The scene where George has to carry a suitcase containing fifty kilos of cocaine through customs is both good crafts work and very exciting to watch.",2007
7,Director Ted Demme gives us an engrossing look at the very high highs and lowest of lows in the life of one of America's pioneer cocaine dealers George Jung(Johnny Depp). This story spans three decades: starting with Jung happy just to buy and sell 'pot'; being the first gringo to move cocaine into America from Pablo Escobar's Colombian cartel; and daydreaming while tending a garden in Federal prison. Jung lived life in the fast lane with the best of them. Soon there was trouble in paradise that led to life on the run from the FBI and DEA.,2001
2,Both Dep and Cruz's characters never showed any drug dependence after years of HEAVY use.  No withdrawal symptoms and no physical or psychological dependence at all after they stopped their cocaine use. ,2003
6,"I was a little curious to see Blow, it's my sister's favorite movie and one of my friends is absolutely in love with this movie, I knew my mom had it and finally watched it today. My mom and I have the same opinion on it, it wasn't a bad movie at all, but it seemed like it just couldn't keep our interest. I don't know, I think it's just those movies where you almost feel bad for the bad guys that always get to me. But the movie in some ways just seemed like it wanted to be the next Scarface, but it just didn't work, you know? This is a movie I was curious as to what drew Johnny to it.",2007
4,"Blow is always watchable, and it's often very entertaining & well acted. However, I also found it extremely trite and shallow. This movie wants to be Goodfellas or even Casino (an unfairly maligned film) and will inevitably be compared with those films. But, it falls well short and comes across like Scorsese-lite, at best, and, at worst, as reductive and predictable as a TV movie. Blow's timing is especially unfortunate since we just got a trenchant, comprehensive view of the drug world from Traffic - and Blow pales in comparison.",2001
5,"Not a minute goes by in Blow that doesn't feel reminiscent of Goodfellas. But whereas Scorsese's movie, was fiery, witty, credible, and involving this one is cumbersome, overlong, and contrived.",2010
4,"Johnny Depp is George Jung, a man we are told at the begging of the film narrating his own story, is the man who was the sole contributor of cocaine to America during the late 70's early 80's (or at least 85% of it as he claims).  In the end though, the only thing I could think of about this statement on which this movie basis it's entire story on was so what'. Problem is other than that, and a weak lead trying to carry the film, this movie I felt was pretty boring, uninteresting, and uneven.",2001
3,"Okay, it glorifies a criminal, that's been established.  It has really bad cinematography (lighting), direction (could they have flash-cut some more?), and effects (George's pillow, er, I mean, gut at the end).  The acting, apart from some decent moments, isn't phenomenal.  And George's accent stinks (exact same new england accent after speaking spanish for years?? Uh, no).",2001
4,"Have you ever talked to  someone who was a criminal?  They are constantly making excuses for their behavior, rationalizing the bad things they do and blaming everyone but themselves for their mistakes.  Such is the case with the film Blow - the folks responsible for this movie have obviously had some pretty major wool pulled over their eyes. This is the Forrest Gump of drug dealer movies - we are led to believe that this blundering, good natured fool might have just gone into selling insurance if he hadn't just been accidentally the first person to think of global cocaine trafficking instead!  Johnny Depp gives a good performance, but so what?  This character is so unworthy of celluloid time the whole thing just seems a shame.  Glossed over are the nastier aspects of his long, habitual criminal career.  Instead we are presented with his life as the big dreamer who had it all, love, money, status, family, riches, friends, and lost it through bad luck and betrayal while he just tried to be a stand-up guy.  The worst part is the shameless picture of the actual George Jung growing old in prison shown before the credits roll.  Are supposed to think he's some kind of political prisoner?  I'm not buying it and neither should you.  Save your money.",2001
7,"Great movie, Depp is typically awesome and way too cool for school. But, don't watch it as a historical biopic, coz it's not. It's ""based"" on a true story. Watch it as a fictional, entertaining movie with a very dramatic, moving ending. The real George Jung was NOT Johnny Depp-cool and is worthy of no sympathy at all. He was a greedy, manipulative, money-grubbing drug dealer and the film conveniently leaves out the FACT that he and his partner, Diego, actually MURDERED several people who interfered with their business, and destroyed countless other lives directly or indirectly through the incredible amounts of cocaine they sold. He got 60 years in Otisville because he deserved 60 years in Otisville.",2007
7,".... Well that`s the impression I got when BLOW started as Ted Demme borrows a very similar style to Martin Scorsese`s classic gangster movie as the movie starts with a flash back a pumping soundtrack and voice over and seeing as the early scenes have Ray Liotta this did nothing to stop me thinking that I`d be watching a Scorsese clone but I was misled by the beginning as Demme has made a good film , maybe not a classic but it`s still a good film .",2003
8,"How rare is it that we get a good monster movie? The 1950's were filled with monster movies that as cheesy as they were, they were also a ton of fun. Victor Salva was a fan of those movies and it shows when he wrote Jeepers Creepers, a fun horror film with a great new movie villain. Not to mention it was a nice break from all the crazy CGI films of late, this was an old fashioned make up horror movie. With two good lead actors and their silly clichés that are guilty pleasures, this was a fun road trip movie with the great creeps.",2001
8,"Victor Salva's auteur turn in B-horrorland is better than most, mainly because he is so much more interesting a storyteller than many of his genre contemporaries.  ""Jeepers"" has several things going for it: suspense, developed characters, above-average acting, and visual style.  That's not to say it's great or even very good.  The movie is wildly uneven, a problem bound to disappoint anyone grabbed by its beguiling opening.",2003
10,"Every once in a while a new horror film comes along that reinvents the genre (Jaws, Halloween, The Exorcist, A Nightmare on Elm Street). These films not only prove to be entertaining, but they add something new and visionary to a market that seems to thrive mostly on rip-offs, sequels and spoofs. JEEPERS CREEPERS should be counted among them. While it doesn't maintain the level of thrills it achieves during the first 45 minutes or so, at just 90 minutes it does still manages to keep an effective level of adrenaline pumping shocks and scares and has one heck of a creepy ending to boot. The acting is first rate and the movie looks terrific. The CGI effects are thankfully kept to a minimum and its just a fun ride! There's nothing more to say. Rent it. Buy it. Enjoy it.",2006
10,"Jeepers Creepers has more in common with 1950's EC horror comic books than any B Horror movies that have been made in the past twenty years.  That fact isn't bad, it's great!  There are a lot of horror plot ideas out there that have never seen decent expression.  The film has some decent surprises along the way and the pace stays interesting.  The identity of the monster stays a little mysterious.  You're not totally certain what it's supposed to be. The plot is done intelligently for a Grade B movie.  The dialog isn't stupid or contrived.  Go see or rent it.  It's worth the cash.",2001
9,"""Jeepers Creepers"" is supposed to be your average monster-movie but turns out to be a very scary and above all a very entertaining film, whose script ist cleverly written and which has some sharp and enjoyable  dialogues. The cast is also stunning, especially Gina Philips and Justin Long in the leading roles of Trish and Darryl. ""Jeepers Creepers"" provides some terrific pictures you will not forget. Definitely Salva's finest work up-to-date, leaving his poor debut feature ""Powder"" far behind. The less you know about this one the more fun it brings, even if  there are also some disappointing facts: the special-fx-work does sometimes look cheap, but in times of CGI-effects in nearly every two fantasy-movies, i prefer the 'organic' look of old-fashioned-effects, even if one can say that they look cheap. So - see it! It's definitely worth the money. And prepare for an unconventional and surprising end...",2001
7,"I must say, I was expecting a lot worse from this film.  The whole first half is genuinely scary.  Although the brother and sister's rivalry was played up just a bit too much, their characters were still a lot more believable than most modern scare films.  Their dialogue was especially natural, and didn't contain a single ""oh my god, like, did I just totally see, like, an undead demon, or is it just me?"" which I praise the writers for (there's only so many times Buffy the Vampire Slayer can say lines like that before I start doing a little slaying of my own).  Despite the constant squabbling the kids do, you can still warm up to them enough to feel empathic about their plight.  The cinematography was excellent, my favourite scene being the long pan up the side of the church.  The music and sound were cued perfectly and conveyed a true sense of fear, anxiety and isolation.",2002
8,"B- Finally, an horror movie that doesn't fail like the usual ones. It's not exactly a slasher flick, and I assume more of a return to creature feature type flicks. Good, frankly, I needed a break from the masked, kitchen-knife wielding, stalker psycho. Now that's not to say it's the best horror film, far from it, but an entertaining one. There's still that horror-movie logic from time to time, like actually trying to sneak into a possible serial killer's body dumping site. You would think they would've of kept going and never come back, like I know sure as hell I would have. But overall the film is a breath of fresh air to me, considering the terrors of ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" and so on.",2010
10,"Hearing mixed reviews about this movie I wasn't sure what to expect. I heard from several people that the first half was good, and that it went down hill from there. So how come an hour into the movie I found myself really enjoying it? The story was actually going good, it also was actually scary, scary like Halloween, not Scream. Which is a good change. Remember don't listen to what other people say, if you like scary movies, and no not to take them seriously go see this, it's worth the money.",2001
10,"I really enjoyed this movie. And I feel most reviewers are short-changing this film by lumping it in with other lesser movies as a ""teen slasher flick"".",2001
10,"The film starts of as others have said, keen on generating tension, uncertainty and foreboding. The initial minutes take elements from other a number of road movies. The key strength of the movie is the Creeper himself.",2004
7,"Jeepers Creepers is a good movie. I read people saying it was stupid for them to go back to the church. But if they didn't what could the movie have been about?! Dumb choices always happen in horror movies, but when these two teens make a dumb decision it's waaayyyy to unrealistic. Let's stop trying to make sense of a movie that has a flying demon that can only eat someone if he scare them and just marvel at the creativity of it. If they didn't go back to the church and went to the next town for help instead the Creeper wouldn't be after them and there wouldn't be a movie in the first place. That's what the movie is about a brother and his sister being chase by a monster so he can eat one of them. And Jeepers Creepers has an ending in which the bad guy gets away with it, that's a very risky move but those are some of the best endings.",2013

6,"Jeepers Creepers is one of the better horror movies I've seen lately. Especially the first half hour has some scary moments. What I didn't like too much about the movie was the fact that they were screaming and yelling all the time, it really started to annoy me. The same for the car and its gearbox. Come on, when they are just driving along, nothing is wrong with it, only when they have to be fast the thing is squealing harder than a pig that is being butchered. The makers have to choose: or the thing never works well, or it always works well. Now it lost all its credibility.",2004

One which was still alive but almost dead. I nearly jumped out of my seat. The very end where they hear Darry scream and then they showed you what happened to him. Whew I sure hope that never happens to me. I'm surprised most of the people gave this movie a 1.  I gave this movie a 10 for making me jump. Good job. I  love horror movies.",2002

8,"When I watched this the first time quite a few years ago, it seemed like it would be a one-off. Now they plan the 3rd one, which is going to come out in 2011. Good or bad, the same director will be at helm, who claimed back then, that he wanted to make sure, that there wouldn't be any sequels. He had it all planned out (a story element would make this ""impossible"" to happen).",2010
6,"I found parts of this movie, mainly the beginning to be very promising. I really thought that it was going to be an 'on the edge of your seat' horror film and the opening had all the tension and weirdness that one needs to set that kind of atmosphere.  But as the movie progressed, even though it never sunk to being bad or even mediocre (no Friday the 13th B.S. here), I think it became a little bit of a disappointment because it didn't live up to the promise that it made in the beginning.  And although I like to let my mind fill in the blanks, there was a lot that went unexplained that made it so that I wasn't really satisfied by the time it finished.  I didn't recognize the names of the actors or the director, and they were neither here nor there for me - that's not to say that I thought the performances were bad, they definitely were fitting and on the mark for the genre.  It's just that they didn't really stick out for me.",2002
1,"This movie is not clever -- it's basically somewhere between gory and hokey with a plot that goes nowhere. It's a poorly put together piece, with no real suspense, no sub plots or stories, just one big long drawn out chase scene between the predator and its two pieces of prey. The ending leaves audience with no sense of a resolution, and its purely for shock value only. Can I emphasize enough -- don't spend any time or money on this movie?!?",2001
1,"Words cannot accurately describe how bad this movie was.  Stupid to the point of insulting!  If a colonic could be turned into a film this was it. It was sheer torture to have to endure the entire film.  I fought numerous thoughts to leave the film, instead opting to stay in hope that it could get better.  I was wrong.  With acting that has not been seen since Keanu Reeves' stint as Bill S. Preston-Esquire in ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure,"" I was painfully reminded why I don't usually go see films like this.  It got to the point where the crowd I was with (which was multi-ethnic grouping) started talking to the screen, each other, talking on their cellular phones, and smoking weed to ease the pain of this movie. ""Powder"" was painful, why this?  It got to the point at which we were all hoping the main characters would get killed.  FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, AVOID THIS MOVIE LIKE THE PLAGUE.  AVOID IT LIKE YOU WOULD A DAVID HASSELHOFF RECORD!",2001
8,"I am absolutely astounded at the negative reviews for this film, both from IMDb and from the critics.",2014
10,"Disney, the film name that once stood for all things innocent and suitable for all ages, has finally started to realise that to survive it needs to become more diverse. Such diversity has been very apparent in the last couple of years. Films like ""Tarzan"" and ""The Emperor's New Groove"" have made an attempt to move away from the traditional song-driven routine of Disney's past and into new, uncharted territory. ""Atlantis"" is the boldest step yet, but we have to remember: This is STILL Disney. The first ever serious film to come out of Disney's animation studio is a major achievement for them - in fact it's so serious it makes it into PG territory. Perhaps why a lot of families were scared off from seeing it this past summer.",2002
8,"I thought this movie was very well put together. The voice-overs were also great. I liked how they all overcame their conflicts and reached their goals. I would recommend this movie to anyone. It was definitely worth the time and money to watch it. Atlantis has some comic scenes that made me laugh. Other scenes made me sad. And others made me glad. It is a movie any age can enjoy. From the moment Milo is the crazy ""profesor"" or until he gathers the crew up for the fantastic voyage under the sea. After I watched the movie, I read the book. It was good as well, but the movie puts better pictures in your mind. It is just like the book. But go ahead and watch this movie!",2006
10,"I thought that this film was very enjoyable. I watched this film with my wife BEFORE I had my first child.  Therefore, I was not watching it as simply family entertainment and I still thoroughly enjoyed it.  It seems as though many of the reviews are pointing out that this movie is not earth shattering, there were no unexpected plot changes and that the movie was predictable and boring.  If these people were watching this movie expecting to have a religious experience doing so, then they were obviously going to be disappointed.   This is simply an animated movie; nothing more.  If you want to see this movie simply to sit back and let yourself be entertained, you will not be disappointed.  In closing, this is definitely not the best movie Disney has made, but it IS entertaining and I do not understand the bad reputation it has received.",2003
10,"This movie was great!  It was an excellent rendition of an ancient myth. The animation was somewhat odd, but nothing new from Disney.  It was definitely better than expected for a Disney movie with no singing.",2001
7,"Here's what I knew about ""Atlantis"" before watching it:",2002
4,"Whether you love or hate this film, no one can deny the hard work put into it. For starters, it inspired a new language - Atlantean. The animation is also very good (and one of Disney's last to be animated in its classic form before the horrible Chicken Little came along).",2016
8,"""Atlantis"" is a new and right step for a Disney feature. It's a good choice to make a film by such a mysterious legend like ""Atlantis"". I didn't have any expectations for this film, but after watching it, I don't quite understand why this film got so bad reviews. Even in my country the reviewers weren't positive.",2007
9,It is written in stone that Disney animations simply ~must~ be musicals. Right? Where? Show me. Because I found this attempt to be much more enjoyable for ~not~ containing the hokey made-for-five-year-old standard Disney musical fare. ,2003
6,"That hits a few speed bumps and shows it, but is well worth watching. Atlantis - The Lost Empire is an imaginative and engaging film about an unfunded linguist who seeks to find the lost city of Atlantis. He is turned down by conventional establishments (i.e. the stuffy museum where he works in the boiler room) and is given his chance by eccentric millionaire Preston Whitmore and a team of explorers. It suffices to say that Milo and company, after much adventure and mishap, discover Atlantis, which is vastly different from anything they expected, and Milo gets more than he expected out of his adventure. I would give this film 6 out of 10 stars - its not great Disney, but it's certainly better than some of the other crap out there. I watch it whenever it comes on TV, which is a good indication of an enjoyable film, I think. It isn't really a film for children. The plot is often hard to follow, and the action may be too intense for very little ones. There is a very sweet romance which grows out of a friendship, so there isn't any kissy kissy to make ""blech"" faces at. The characters are human and funny, and there are some pretty good one liners in here. Worth the time, if you like adventure and comedy.",2005
7,"Atlantis is an experiment for Disney, but it is one of they're most successful ones.  By excluding often dumb songs (though some of them in the past weren't horrible like in The Lion King and the Jungle Book) and even dumber animal sidekicks, Disney for one of they're few times taken an interesting type of story and given it good dialogue that will appeal to adults more than kids.  And while I know kids are the prime target here, I reccomend the animation for them, which takes it's cues this time heavily from the pulp comic book tradition (which is a good thing) and the anime style of quickness and seriousness in characters (which is even better).",2001
10,"Maybe it's because it doesn't follow the typical Disney formula, but this fun, interesting, and hits on some relevant points about dreams, ambitions, and human greed. If you're looking for a dashing prince to save a beautiful princess, go watch another movie. If you want a movie that is enjoyable to watch again and again, watch this one. While character development varies, it's not hard to like the characters. Even the antagonists are likable, in the way that only villains can be. The animation style is different than most other Disney films, and personally, I like it.",2014
8,"Although I have said that Tarzan is the last great Disney movie, there have been some surprisingly good films like Lilo and Stitch and Fantasia 2000, though the best of the post-Tarzan Disney movies is Emperor's New Groove. On the other hand, some of the direct to video sequels are saved by some excellent voice overs and moments of cuteness, but overall they are cheap parodies of their originals, Patch's London Adventure sadly being the worst. Atlantis: The Lost Empire belongs to the surprisingly good side of the film spectrum, with excellent visuals, particularly of Atlantis itself. The music was beautiful and sounded epic, and the voice cast was great, the standouts being Michael J.Fox and James Garner as Milo and Rourke respectively. John Mahoney and Cree Summer offer fine support as Whitmore and Kida, who is so sexy. I only have two criticisms of this movie. One is that while the idea of the story is fantastic, it is a little too fast for my liking. My second criticism is that while the script is very good on the most part, I don't think it is as funny as a film like Emperor's New Groove, though Vinny was hilarious, so I just worry that younger viewers mightn't find it as engaging as their parents. Overall, very pleasing to the eye, and a very good film overall. 8/10 Bethany Cox",2009
4,"In the end, ATLANTIS is a specimen form the awkward middle period between the wonderful animated Disney musicals such as The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and the modern Pixar films.",2008
9,"Atlantis: The Lost Empire is a better movie than I thought. I never thought this movie would lead to my expectations. True, this movie started slow, but as the movie wore on it became more to my liking. The story takes place in 1914 and is about a guy named Milo. Milo believes in the fabled Atlantis. Along with friends of his grandfather, he embarks on an amazing adventure of his own. Along the way, he must endear friendship, betrayal, trust, and more. The voice cast is great. They surely know how to carry movies with only their voice talent. The music is nothing special but likable anyway. The animation is not the best, but it is still good enough. Overall, this is a good family movie for all ages. I rate this movie 9/10.",2008
9,"The movie ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire"" is a shining gem in the rubble of films produced by the Disney Studios recently. Parents who have had to sit through ""The Jungle Book 2"" or even a Pokemon movie will surely appreciate this one.",2005
6,"Gone are the days of completely harmless animations such as Bambi or Snow White. Today's Disney churns out movies like this (which I admit I found enjoyable enough) but which, in my humble opinion, are a far cry from the kid-friendly, don't-need-to-vet-it, it's-a-Disney, movies of yesteryear.",2005
2,"I heard a really bad rumor before I went in to the theater to watch Disney¡¦s Atlantis. But I still went watch it because I want to see it for myself. What I heard is Disney ripped off a Japanese animate called ¡§Nadia - The secret of blue water"" (Gainax - 1991).",2001
3,"I am a huge anime fan, and when the kid i babysat popped this movie in, I thought ""Ya!"" instantly I regretted it, as I saw the story Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water. Everything is related to Nadia. I personally also thought that the characters where underdeveloped, there was a plot, but the plot didn't hold too well. I think that the best way to make this a great movie, for it not to be even a movie. Make it was TV series like Nadia, and it would do alright. I often felt like the story was dragging, oh wait, it was. To me this story was an insult to us anime fans, and a futile attempt to take Hideaki Anno's second greatest masterpiece. This movie is not worth your time, since I wasted a total of 90 minutes watching crap, when I could have been writing. So, do not see this horrible, insulting, movie.",2006
5,"Classic Disney Fodder. Host of big names doing voice-overs. Cliched baddies. Noble causes. Happy endings. As I said, just plain usual. No apparent graphical enhancements since Disney's last few feature outings. Personally I await 'Monsters Inc.', with more anticipation than this offering. Not to say that this was not enjoyable as it was and the story, as usual, will appeal to both children and adults. This adult has seen for too much of his wholesome mulch before, however, and it brought nothing outstanding to a Disney catalogue already burdened with titles not dissimilar to this. Michael J Fox and Leonard Nimoy, amongst others, all make characters believable, but as I said, it has all been done before. A winning formula no doubt, but it would be nice if Disney stretched themselves like they did when making the technological leap to 'The Lion King'. Harmless, bland and average.",2001
9,"I've seen this film three times, each viewing separated by several years, beginning with seeing it in the theater. And even as an ever-older adult, I like it more every time I watch it. This is one of the best things that Disney has ever produced, in my humble opinion.",2014

After seeing it a few times I rate this movie as high as Fletch and other classic comedies, probably higher.",2005
10,"This movie was hysterical! The way they joked around with each other was so true to life! It wasn't unrealistic at all! Anybody who sees this will have to agree that there is at least one character in the film that reminds them of one of their buddies! I know it sure reminded me of the guys that hang around me! We just saw the movie this evening on IFC in widescreen, without commercials, and unedited. I am very happy I waited to see it this way instead of a TNT, TBS, USA, or FOX broadcast version. I am definitely getting this movie on DVD as soon as possible! The outtakes and behind the scenes features are probably fantastic!",2006

With an unknown and unproven cast, this film captured a certain sense of zeal within a viewer, certainly making the viewer wish highway patrolmen were this funny and irregular all the time. Funny, even though the comedy was sometimes low brow, this film certainly earned its accolades at the Sundance Film Festival.",2002

There is a lot of great material to chew on all through the movie.  The rivalry, pranks, and rookie bashing are things we cherish.

This is one, that will actually require a second viewing after wards, either because you're laughing so hard, or you don't get most of the jokes. If you don't understand it the first time around, please watch it again. There are a LOT of jokes and gags here, most of them are fall-on-the-floor funny, and even if you don't get it, the movie will still make you smile. I think this is the perfect movie to watch on a bad day. It will cheer you up instantly.",2006
1,It is mind-boggling that viewers gave this film an average rating of better than 6 points out of 10.  I went in expecting some zany fun along the lines of Airplane or National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.  Instead the movie offered a few lame sight gags and a cast of characters that you just didn't grow to care about.  Were I still a 16-year-old male (instead of a 45-year-old male) I might not have viewed this film as such a big waste of time.  But my tastes have changed since I was sixteen.,2002
1,Unfunny. Stupid. Lame. I'm trying to think of more words to describe this movie which I unwittingly forked over good money to see.

10,"A great film, with a good pace, lot's of great physical humor and good dialog. This film features terrific characters with the leads (the members of Broken Lizard) and supporting cast. It even has wonder woman (well, Linda Carter is in it at least. And she's still a babe.) The film is also visually interesting with good cinematography and excellent editing. There are great performances from all of the characters including the stoners, cops, and troopers.",2006
3,"I'll admit, word of mouth got me to watch this one.  And usually that's good, but this time it didn't work.  I only laughed once and smiled throughout.  Certainly isn't that funny.   The last good funny movie I watched was Rat.  Golfballs is better than this movie.  I didn't fully understand why it's got an R rating either.  ",2002
2,"If there's ever a movie that people say isn't as bad as it looks or what critics say, don't agree with them. That's what I did with Super Troopers. It's a misguided non tour-de-farce that has no idea where it's going. In fact, to make the obligatory pun, this movie could be called Super Poopers, since that's what this movie basically is and what most of the `jokes' consist of.",2003
2,"After reading so many reviews about what a hilarious film this is, I'm wondering if someone at the video store switched DVD on me as a practical joke. This unknown comedy troupe called Broken Lizard, who has been compared to Kids in the Hall and Monty Python (I can't imagine a bigger insult to those two talented groups) put together a poorly acted & scripted, rather disjointed film without *any* laughs whatsoever that left me wondering how such a film was ever made. Playing a group of unlikable police officers, the jokes were weak and underwhelming, and made me nostalgic for the days of the ""Police Academy"" films- even the weakest sequel of those was funnier than this movie was (and don't get me wrong, I did not find the sequels to be funny). The best thing I can say about this one is that it had pleasant moments here and there but it's hard to justify spending $4 and an hour and a half watching this. Score: a rather generous 2/10",2002

Too much of the movie was dedicated to crude, sexual jokes.  It ended up having way too much crude humor.  Turned it off before it was over. Rent something else.",2003
1,"From the opening ten minutes, I thought this would be truly hilarious, an underground gem.  The scenes of the police messing with the stoners had me and the rest of the audience truly busting a gut.  From that point on: dead silence.  I actually heard one person comment, ""When are they getting back to the jokes?""  When they did, I found the jokes had the quality of the bad jokes one might make as small talk around the office--certainly not funny enough to hear in a movie.  I honestly did not laugh again until near the end with the scene in the burger place that is prominently featured in the commercial.  My brother commented, ""This is like Police Academy 8, except that movie would've been a lot funnier.""",2002

I finally said why not give it a chance as I keep hearing about how much of a great ""comedy"" it is.",2010
1,"This is one of those movies where that you know its supposed to be funny, but its to stupid to be funny(remember ""Robin Hood:Men in Tights"" had that same effect). This isn't a funny film, its a stupid film. Most of the film revolves around Lame-Sex jokes, Bathroom humor and Drug humor, and even by those standards it wasn't funny. I remember during the fight sceen where the Highway patrol officers get in a fist fight along the interstate with the local city cops, I knew that sceen was supposed to be funny but I didn't even as much as crack a smile, and I looked around me and no one else was realy laughing at it either. At that moment I heard a lady sitting behind whisper over to the man she was sitting with and said ""this is just dumb""- it was at that moment that no one else was laughing at that sceen either.-It was that kind of movie",2002

6,"If one wants to remake a movie, the best option is probably to choose and original that was good, but not a great classic. Clearly, any attempt to remake a concept that failed first time around is fraught with danger, but an attempt to remake a classic runs the risk that one's film will be unfavourably compared with the original. The original 1968 film of 'Planet of the Apes' is one of cinema's great science fiction classics. More than an adventure story, it touches on some of the concerns of the late sixties- the fear of nuclear war, race relations- and also raises more fundamental issues about the relationship between man and nature, the relationship between religion and science, Darwinism and animal rights. It was therefore a brave move on Tim Burton's part to try and remake it. ",2004
3,"Thank you Hollywood. Yet another movie classic utterly ruined by a cheap, shallow, effect-heavy and redundant remake.

Nova, the girl in the original Planet of the Apes, was a better developed character than Daena in this version, for all that she does not say a single word.

But that's not all good news.First of all,the hero lacks charisma and the apes and their sensational make-up simply overwhelm him and drown him out.On the contrary,majestic Charlton Heston,even when he was in chains,displayed a Shakespearian grandeur in the first version.",2001

8,"This is a remake of the old classic starring Charlton Heston, though as happens with a lot of remakes these days, while following the theme, the plot works out differently. In the original film, Charlton Heston travels to the Andromeda Galaxy and when he returns 2000 years in the future, he discovers that he has landed on a planet that is ruled by apes. It is only by the end of the film that he discovers that it is Earth. This film had the memorable lines of 'take your stinking paws off me you damned dirty ape', and 'You Maniacs! You blew it up! Ah, damn you! God damn you all to hell!' This version doesn't end as dramatically as the original (he returns to Earth to discover that the Earth that he knew was gone and is populated by apes) and the first line spoken by an ape to a human (instead of the other way around as in the original movie) is 'Get your stinking hands off me, you damn dirty human!'. Further, the film begins in a space station orbiting Saturn where they are investigating a magnetic vortex and the hero lands up on the planet of the apes when he travels through the vortex and lands up a thousand years in the future.",2013

It's hard to say if it was better, I'd say, they are almost on different grounds, due to the Special FX we had in the 60's and the stuff we got now. So that changes a lot, but it's not just the FX, the story is great, it keeps you guessing, and near the end, you just..don't know what to expect, I didn't and I read about the ending on the net anyway. This was defiantly a ""Re-Imagining"" not a ""Re-make"" This is so different than the first. In fact, I don't even know what the heck the ending was about, was it earth, was it another planet...I swear, you think about the ending to this movie for more than 5 minutes, your head will explode.

I mean there were a few little twists especially at the end, but I would have made it a lot more deeper. All and all it was a great movie and I would definitley go see it again.",2001
10,"I really enjoyed this movie. It was fun to see a fairly clean movie that was fun to watch. The acting of Julie Andrews and Anne Hathaway is superb and the story shines out hope. The director takes a very unlikely event and makes it believable, teaching us all something in the process. It was refreshing to see a teen film without all the sexual inuendos and crude language.",2002
6,"A fun story - if entirely unoriginal - about an awkward and unpopular 15 year old San Francisco girl (Anne Hathaway) who discovers out of the blue that she is the heir to the throne of the small, fictional European principality of Genovia, and has to deal with all the adjustments that requires.",2002
10,"I loved this movie and although it may have been slightly cliché, the dialog was quite smart and it was quite a funny movie. I think that if you expect the movie to be Oscar worthy, it will obviously fall short. But as it only attempts to be a sweet story about a misfit 15 year old turned princess, it completely lives up to it's potential. I think that Julie Andrews completely made the movie and that Anne Hathaway also did an excellent job. The movie is great for people of all ages because it has a simplistic plot yet has great one liners and great repartee between the characters of the Queen and Princess Mia. I also think that the minor characters are great also because they provide even more comic relief.",2005
10,"The Princess Diary talk about a 15-year-old teenager whose name is Mia wants to be invisible at school. One day, on the contrary, she was told to be the Princess of a country, which is very opposite to her former expectation. What a big turning to her life ! What she will undergo ? Mia is my very first and memorable impression about this movie. Anything about her comes from Anne Hathaway's virgin performance. After deeply understand the character-Mia, Anne let Meg's story vivid on the screen. Her acting is natural and every detail show a combination of her own understanding of the character and the shining of the character itself. I noticed some details about Mia,which is very sophisticated. Mia's school uniform represent the 1950's elegance. The black socks and ties. What a copy of Audrey Hepburn in ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"". Mia's smile remind me of another famous actress-Julie Roberts, who has become a mother recently. The beautiful big smile is very eye-catching and also memorable. Oh,I remember another person who also have those big smile. She is Amélie Poulain. The Story is philanthropic and extraordinary.It's not simply a Cinderella story.But, a great story about grandmother and granddaughter, a education-valued story about mother and daughter, a special story about father and daughter,a ever-sweet story about first love, a beautiful story about friendship. Above all, it's a growing story. Based on Meg's classic story The Princess Diary, the motion picture make her characters believe-like in another artistic way. Just like having read Margaret's story (Gone With The Wind), you then watch O'Selznick's GWTW movie. Your feeling will be like: I seemed to be a part of the story. Those characters are just and always around you! Clarisse: The Sound of Music is recognized as a movie that is priceless, so, this also recognized the supporting actress's performance is priceless. Julie is an actress that could act well on any characters. The governess,the grandmother or on Broadway, etc. Helen (Caroline Goodall) played a vital role is Mia's growing period. This daughter and mother is a good role model. Because they show the grand respect for each other. Anyone can't grow without friend, the princess,too. From the friendship with Lilly, Mia knows how to tell the truth, how to apologize and how to deal with something that is uniquely occurred in teenager, which is called Growing Pains. Like other reviewers, I also feel the last sentence Mia told Michael is Soooooooo...... Cool ! :-O ""You saw me when I was invisible."" Why we feel cool ? Because that's what true love is. And, especially, that's what true love is to a princess !! Joe is a person we can't ignore. He acted as a imitate friend to Mia. He told her what she should be. And he is virtually the bodyguard. Oh, by the way, he is a very very special one ! Some of the songs in The Princess Diary is also memorable."" A Summer Song"" remind me of those romantic school kisses. The final song ""Miracles Happen"" is special designed for this movie, for Mia and also for all of us. Now, I am recommending this movie to YOU from my heart.",2005
9,"I was surprised to see that the overall voting average for PD was in the 6 range, as so many people I know enjoyed it as much as I did. Anne Hathaway plays the role perfectly, making the awkward Mia extremely likable, as the heroine always should be.  Julie Andrews shines like a true royal.  The entire supporting cast adds something special to the film. It's quality family fun, and destined to be another Disney classic! 9/10 stars!",2002
10,"This is one of the few movies that really made me meditate of my own life, and the invisibility around me. I think that Anne Hathaway and Julie Andrews are the coolest grandaughter-grandmother couple I've ever seen - Julie Andrews being such a great actress, and Hathaway being so beautiful. Lame acting for Lana - whoever interprets her - doesn't look like a real spoilt brat - See Freaky Friday's spoilt brats for more. Anyway, cool, great movie with a superb plot - can't wait for part 2. I give it a 10. The love story between the two characters - Mia and Michael was so nice, and the line ""You saw me when I was invisible"" was sooooo cool.",2004

Now, Mia is going to have classes with her Grandman, Queen Clarisse Renaldi, to things like history, art until how to sit and band in order to behave as a princess. Paolo also helps in her looks making Mia become a very beautiful girl.",2005

10,"I think the Princess Diaries was one of the best Disney movies I've seen. Anne Hathaway has it all! She's pretty,smart, and funny! I loved the comedy in the movie and the story was good too. It had some scenes with feeling, I love movies like that. I know Anne will never read this but if she ever does....You're doing a wonderful job and doing what you love and don't let anyone tell you different.",2004
4,"I think I only decided to try this film from Disney Studios because of the cast, and might be alright for a cheap giggle, and that is exactly what it was, from director Garry Marshall (Overboard, Pretty Woman). Basically socially awkward but bright San Francisco 15-year old teenager Mia Thermopolis (debuting Anne Hathaway) raised by single mother Helen (Caroline Goodall) discovers that she is related to royalty. She can't believe that she is the daughter of the deceased Prince of Genovia, with his wife Queen Clarisse Renaldi (Dame Julie Andrews) as Grandmother, who tells her she has to decide whether or not to take his place. For a while Mia tries to live normally with this revelation being secret, even after being primped up, but she is being stalked by the press when the truth is blurted out. It looks like she is convinced of saying no, but changes her mind after reading a letter from her father, and she is a real princess by the end. Also starring Hector Elizondo as Joe, Heather Matarazzo as Lilly Moscovitz, Mandy Moore as Lana Thomas, Robert Schwartzman as Michael Moscovitz, Escape to Witch Mountain's Erik Von Detten as Josh Bryant, Sandra Oh as Vice Principal Gupta and Larry Miller as Paolo the Hairdresser. Hathaway in her first film is quite good, Andrews brings the usual sweet-faced radiance to her role, and while it isn't the funniest family comedy you will see, it isn't too bad. Okay!",2009
1,"I just LOVED the Princess Diaries books by Meg Cabot, and my friend loved the movie, so I went and saw the movie with pretty high expectations. Ten-twenty minutes into it, I was like, Um, What??? Halfway in, I was outraged. Leaving the T.V room of my friend, I was determined that I would like to sue Disney and the makers of the movie. What is WITH those people? Why couldn't they stick to the book? The book was funny, original, and interesting. The movie was seriously crap. One of the best things about the books was the setting in New York, not to mention Grandmere's total scariness, Lilly's bossiness, Lana's total cruelty, and TINA HAKIM BABA. None of these things were there in the movie. Lana Weinberger (Thomas?) was not even mildly threatening. The school was more like some museum. And, what, there weren't even any students in for Assembly when Mia threw up? Michael was scarily creepy-looking. Josh was - less said about him, the better. Julie Andrews was graceful and supportive and beautiful - but, HELLO, GRANDMERE IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE GRACEFUL AND FRIENDLY AND BEAUTIFUL!!! Anne Hathaway as Mia was the only watchable thing about the movie, and not even because of her (lack of) acting skills, but because she was at least portraying Mia like in the book. And she is also quite pretty. But apart from her - and the part in the movie where Mia dines with all those important people, and where she gives her speech, and of course the part where Lana sings that song at the beach party - the movie is TERRIBLE!!!",2004
1,"This is one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. I am in the age group that this movie was made for, and I hated it. The plot was childish and totally absurd. Who ever heard of a Genovia or whatever it was?? It was very slow moving, and the viewers never got anywhere in the movie fast. Remember the trailers? The trailers were funny, which was the reason that I paid to see this movie. The movie is soooo slow.",2002
10,"I liked this movie because it reminded me very much of an old fashioned fairy tale. It was predictable and consistent and could have used a plot twist here and there , there should have been a bit of intrigue after all it is about a princess. The film was however entertaining and typically the kind that Disney has excelled at over the years. I certainly recommend this film for family viewing. Julie Andrews does a fine performance as the Queen and Anne Hathaway does a fantastic job as the princess, I think she has a great career as an actress ahead of her. A typical Disney Fairy tale and I'm glad that Disney is going back to doing these kind of movies.",2004
1,"A waste of so many talented people - and my time.  It was supposed to be funny, but I heard not one laugh in the theatre during the showing.  It was a cute premise, and I thought this director would always do things well. But is was a dumb, boring movie, in my opinion.  The three who were with me agreed.",2001
1,"Not even good performances by Julie Andrews and Hector Elizondo could save this from being a dreadful waste of time.  It was so predictably awful that I can't believe it did even relatively well in the box office.  My only surmise is that a lot of people thought it would be good and by the time they discovered it wasn't, it was too late to get a refund.",2002
1,"Sometimes women act so well I could just marry them immediately for that. Well, after her wonderful part in Strike! - she was definitely even better than Kirsten Dunst or any other of the teenage casts there - I never saw any other movie of Heather Matarazzo. Now here she is back again, and I was surely happy about seeing her again !",2002
1,"I am a huge fan of the books. They are hilarious and I enjoy reading them greatly. Meg Cabot's sense of humor is simply fabulous and the characters are wonderful! The movie...oh god. Where do i start? Everything is completely and totally 100% opposite of what happens in the book. When you compare the book to the movie side by side, the book's humor completely overshadows the movie. The movie is funny to a fine point, whereas the book has me crying from laughter. Julie Andrews was wrong for the part. Her grandmother is SCARY AND MEAN. NOT nice. Mia was fourteen years old! FOURTEEN! Everything about this film screws up the original book i fell in love with. Do yourself a favor: Read the books",2006

1,"I've seen a lot of bad movies, but this one takes the cake. Julie Andrews does an excellent job in her role, but there is little else to compliment in this film.  It is cliche' driven and generally most of the players overact, possibly to compensate for the story that trudges along.  Perhaps young girls would enjoy this film, but I don't think any adult would want to spend the time watching this ruined fairy tale. I give this movie a half star, only because Julie Andrews does such a fine job.",2002

I have family members from all ages that watch this and we all laugh our butts off. Seth is so talented and it's great to watch all those toys we played with or characters we religiously watched do something totally out of character. Obviously if you are watching Adult Swim you have a certain sense of humor and Robot Chicken fits right in with Family Guy, Futurama, Sealab and ATHF. Hey how many of you have ever wished Kit from Knight Riderwould explode into a fiery flame or the Duke Boys would give each other that ""special look""? Wish granted! Go Seth and make us laugh.",2005
1,"Completely random and fast-paced stop-motion animation is all what Robot Chicken is about. With every episode being the Adult Swim traditional 11 minutes, each is packed full of hilarious parodies and shorts. And the best thing is you never know who you'll see the next episode.",2005
1,"I don't see how anyone not under the age of 10 could find this funny. Some examples of the ""humor"" in this show are Mr. Rogers being mean and a doll that looks like Napolean Dynamite quoting the movie Napolean Dynamite. Hilarious! I would have enjoyed this when I was in 3rd grade, but I also thought the parody of the Barney theme song was clever and funny (I hate you, you hate me, so lets go out and kill Barney...) Why do you think references to other TV shows and movies are so funny? Does it make you feel special to think you are in on the inside joke? ""Wow, it's just like in that movie, only dolls are doing it instead! How clever!""",2005
1,"This show is the epitome of what I avoid by watching adult swim original shows rather than more mainstream comedy; predictable pop culture laden crap. The skits often follow a dull formula, a parody of some TV show movie or toy with some kind of violent sexual or poop related joke carelessly thrown in, that plays out like a claymation family guy joke. The bits are generally a a poorly executed carbon copy of the source material, but with the aforementioned stupidly obvious joke thrown in. And when the creators are brave enough to stop suckling on pop cultures nurturing teat for a few seconds, we often are left a 5 (or less) second clip of something so creatively dull and brain dead the only plausible reaction is that of total silence. I say often because there are sparse moments of amusement, but these are too rare to make the show worth watching. The show is and exercise in poor writing and voice acting, and mediocre animation. The visual style of the show is unique, but not really smooth in any sense of the word, often seeming crude and rough. I do like claymation when its done right, and there's none of that here. What irks me above all is the show's immense popularity and the fact that it is constantly on adult swim's weekday lineup while worthy, innovative, dynamic and unique shows are forced aside. Are people really that dumb that they can only appreciate the most dull and obvious humor? Well that's to be expected, looking at the awful Family Guy's popularity.",2008
1,and I hated it.,2007
5,"What seemed like a new and fresh comedy quickly wore out as a one-joke show. It's just cheaply animated puppets or toys representing characters from past TV shows that beat the crap out of each other or talk dirty. Toilet humor was mentioned, it seemed like it was all written by a 10-year old kid. Everything is also extremely referential so if you have never seen the show that they're ridiculing there is no joke left. The only thing really funny are apparently the silly references to movies and TV shows.",2007
3,"In theory, i should love this show. I love crazy drawn out jokes, a la Family Guy, parody and random, nonsensical humor, a la Tim and Eric's awesome show (great job!), and ridiculous slapstick, a la jackass, but this show just doesn't do it for me.",2010

9,"Creators Seth Green (Austin Powers, Family Guy, Idle Hands) and Matt Senreich bring you priceless comedy and social commentary in the form of stop-motion animation. Green uses his extensive knowledge of all things pop culture to create spoofs of everything from Star Wars to Mr. Rogers Neighborhood. The majority of characters are shown as familiar action figures (everything from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to Transformers, and even Voltron). Fans of classic 80's shows such as G.I. Joe or He-Man will find their favourite characters once again return to life with new demented and funny attitudes. Those providing voices include: Seth MacFarline, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Matthew Lillard, Linda Cardellini, Breckin Meyer and more!",2006
4,"If you take the toys we loved from the 80's and animate them in short, stop-action pop-culture parodies of everything from Kill Bill to American Idol, throw in voices like Mark Hamill, Phyllis Diller, Christian Slater, Hulk Hogan, Ashton Kutcher, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Seth MacFarlane, and music by Les Claypool, how could it possibly go wrong? Adult Swim's Robot Chicken will show you how. They've secretly replaced the humor with a barrage of bowel movements, flatulence, and more bowel movements. Let's see if you can spot the difference. Apparently there are some who can't. There's nothing wrong with crude humor (as this show claims to have) but Seth Green and Co. just add an extra helping of 'crude' to cover up the fact that there's little to no humor. One scene opens with Skeletor, Mumm-Ra, Cobra Commander, and Lex Luthor sitting in a car together, stuck in traffic. In this scenario, anything that happened would be hilarious. Anything EXCEPT Skeletor farting and forcing the other villains to smell it. Brilliant, right? Right? So if you love super heroes but have always wanted to see them sitting on the toilet, then Robot Chicken is for you. Otherwise, stick with the Simpsons for pop-culture parodies that are actually funny. Maybe Seth Green should stick to doing voices and just play with his toys on the toilet at home to his heart's content. And possibly think about some therapy. Can anyone really be this obsessed with going to the bathroom?.",2007
2,"""Robot Chicken"" is basically a string of unrelated ""skits,"" featuring children's action figures being manipulated into zany and irreverent situations. The concept, in theory, is hilarious.

2,I am sorry to say but this show has not pleased my appetite of laughter . the ideas are good but they did not express them in a way to make me laugh. The animation could be improved a lot and the laughs in the show are another annoying aspect of this trying to be humorous show . After watching this show i found Alvin and the chipmunks FUNNY!!! trust me you may admire the ideas but its not so funny as to fill Urey appetite and I'm sorry to say that if you find this show funny you don't know the meaning of the word FUNNY its spelled F-U-N-N-Y!!!But I will say this that if every episode is made again with a little more animation and jokes are more funny then i would give this show what it has been actually given!!,2011

8,"The days of Airplane and Naked Gun are over. Nowadays, we have the Scary Movies, Spy Hard, Date Movie, Not Another Teen Movie, etc....of all of these, Teen Movie is quite easily the best one. The point of spoofs and satires, to me, are not just to take familiar scenes and do something retarded and gross with them, but instead to actually make fun of all the things in the original movies that, while watching them, we all turned to our friends and said ""wait a minute, thats kind of stupid"". Teen Movie does this extremely well. How many of us lucky movie fans who saw She's All That had trouble seeing why everyone in the movie thought the lead actress was ugly just because she had glasses and a ponytail? She was still a babe! How many of these teen movies give the main lead actress a friend who is clearly into her, but she always seems to ignore any possibility of romance between them, instead pursuing another character and asking for her friend's help/advice? How many people thought the characters in Cruel Intentions were just sexually over the top to the point of being absurd? Teen Movie pokes great fun at all of these flaws. It is, unlike many other movies that attempt to be like it, a true satire, taking characters and not just doing stupid things with them, but exaggerating the traits of their serious counterparts and, when it comes down to it, just making fun of them. It has surprisingly good plot cohesion while still making fun of a variety of teen movies. I suppose the best way to distinguish this movie from all other modern spoofs is that this one is truly intelligent. Sure it has some stupid jokes, and toilet humor (that I admit I chuckled at in disgust like the diarrhea scene and the lesbian kiss with the old woman), but it also has some very clever jokes, like when is it appropriate to start a slow clap, why do these teen movies seem to only have one black character, and how silly is it that things slow down for emphasis when the beautiful female lead enters the room. Please, give this one a chance. If you've seen the other modern spoofs, I'm confident you will appreciate the noticeable and subtle differences between them and Teen Movie that make the latter much more enjoyable and palatable to watch.",2006
8,"The IMDb ranking for this film is quite harsh in my opinion. OK, this film was never going to win an Oscar, but it's enjoyable throughout and has some very good laughs in it. I'm not a big fan of teen movies but I saw this and was impressed. It's light-hearted and not afraid to appear ridiculous (infact most of the time it does this deliberately) and it doesn't pretend to be ""Just another teen movie"", indeed it IS ""Not another teen movie"", it's a very enjoyable laugh at the expense of those films.",2005
10,"I have to say, I didn't expect much from this film. Basically ""Scary Movie"" spoofing teen classics instead of horror films. I watched it and actually liked it. Yes, this film could possibly be qualified as one of the silliest movies of the decade, but that's sort of the point. This movie had laughing so hard I was gasping for breath. The humor is juvenile, but FUNNY. The plot is stupid, but HILARIOUS. It's really fun to stop and say ""Hey, that 10 Things About You!"" or ""Oh, they're doing Can't Hardly Wait"". This film is probably one of the funniest films I've seen in a long time, it's not for everybody, but it's a good movie.",2005

Not Another Teen Movie makes fun of movies from the 80's to the 90's and is very clever. I saw this movie with a friend and honestly, while there are a few parts that were a little too much for me, I don't exactly dig potty humor, but there are some really funny scenes. It was fun to see someone finally make fun of the all the clichés that were rubbed in our faces: the nerdy girl turning into the hot girl, clichéd characters that would never be friends but somehow are, the best friend in love with the other friend who's in love with the popular kid, you get the drill.",2002

The only reason I wouldn't give it a 10 out 10 is because none of the story line is original to the film. All the stereotypical characters are well acted and the script keeps you laughing throughout the entire film. It is the best teen movie out there, even though it is making fun of all the rest of them. It is filled to the brim with tramps, hotties, jocks, hormone driven underclassmen, high school jargon and all the other things we have come to enjoy and loathe about teen movies.",2005

Also, the makers of this movie have had the courage to dive into the Absurd, which is one of the most productive, though harder to understand(for some people) types of humor. This is why there are folks who didn't like it; and it's also why the title is wholly appropriate, because it has taken all the Absurd it could find in teen movies, and put it into one great work, that laughs at traditional teen movies.

He has a great body as shown in the 'Banana Split' gag! Lol. Does anyone know where I can get the lyrics to the song? I just love it so much!!! It's brilliant. I also love the slow clap guy.

They've addressed all the clichés, and how unlike high school these movies really are. Think about it, to be popular means to be liked by a lot of people. And who likes the snotty brat who thinks she is prettier than everyone else? I attended several different high schools around the U.S., and these girls exist, but they don't get named prom queen.",2005

By the way, that quote in the summary is one of the funniest lines in the movie.

The party scene where the girl is walking through the house naked prompting another naked party going girl to say to her friend, ""Oh my god, I can't believe she's wearing the same outfit as me."" to which her friend replies, ""It looks much better on you."" I laugh all the time on that part. NOT ANOTHER TEEN MOVIE is pure, no thinking involved, stupid comedy. But, like with SCARY MOVIE 3, I like this brainless stuff.

If you haven't seen those movies, you're missing out, and you will probably think that this is a dumb comedy and nothing else. Good farce, though, is hard to find, and while it won't change anyone's life, Not Another Teen Movie filled an empty slot in pop culture, and did a good job of it.

Today they showed Vanilla Sky on TV and as I had nothing better to do... and as it turned out, I would have had a hard time finding anything better to do. Vanilla Sky is a frightening, sad and touching movie, actually one of the best I've seen in a while. I was surprised by how I was affected watching it. It's hard to explain, but during the movie your feelings towards the characters and your perception of what is going on changes and it's quite an emotional journey. Vanilla Sky really touched me in a way that is very rare for a movie, or any media for that matter.",2006
8,"I for one really like this movie for some reasons I'll go into late but I want to touch on why I think people don't like it. First off, there are people out there who just like to hate Tom Cruise. I don't understand it really. Second, Cameron Crowe I think successfully p***es off two groups of movie-goers with this film. The casual, relaxed, ""not looking to think too hard"" group of movie-goers are left confused when the plot takes a complete 180 at the end of the movie. And the deep, philosophical, mystery-fans are devastated when Crowe has one of his characters completely explain the mystery.",2003
9,"Vanilla Sky is a 2001 remake of the great 1997 movie, Abre Los Ojos (Open Your Eyes). And in my opinion, a much more human and emotional version. Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a selfish egomaniac who takes other people's emotions for granted, and thinks only of himself. Jason Lee plays Brian Shelby, David's best, and in many ways, only friend. Penelope Cruz plays Sofia Serrano, Brian's girlfriend whom accompanies him to David's birthday party. Cameron Diaz plays Julie Gianni, David's occasional bed buddy. Kurt Russell plays Dr. Curtis McCabe, a psychologist interviewing David. All of their interactions, and the consequences of them, make Vanilla Sky one of the most emotional, and complex thrillers ever made. I won't explain anymore of the plot, because it's far more compelling, the less you know. Ignore all people that call this film too confusing to follow. If you pay attention, you won't be confused. The film is very complex, but not confusing. And in my opinion, one of the best movies ever made.",2004
10,"I could not agree more with the quote ""this is one of the best films ever made."" If you think Vanilla Sky is simply a ""re-make,"" you could not be more wrong. There is tremendous depth in this film: visually, musically, and emotionally.",2006
10,"""Vanilla Sky"" was a wonderfully thought out movie. Or rather, ""Abre Los Ojos"" was well thought out. I watched that movie late one night, excited about what was to come. I wasn't disappointed. By the end of the movie, I was awstruck. I couldn't get it off my mind. The whole idea of it just blew me away. The ending, was more of a surprise than Shyamalan could ever do. The plot line was also something that kept me interesting through and through. The cast, superb. It was an all around wonderful movie. The kind of movie you can watch again and again and always find something new. I've seen it four or five times and I'm always finding something new. It's a movie to keep you interested forever.",2004
10,"How strange the human mind is; this center of activity wherein perceptions of reality are formed and stored, and in which one's view of the world hinges on the finely tuned functioning of the brain, this most delicate and intricate processor of all things sensory.  And how much do we really know of it's inner-workings, of it's depth or capacity?  What is it in the mind that allows us to discern between reality and a dream?  Or can we? Perhaps our sense of reality is no more than an impression of what we actually see, like looking at a painting by Monet, in which the vanilla sky of his vision becomes our reality.  It's a concept visited by filmmaker Cameron Crowe in his highly imaginative and consciousness-altering film, `Vanilla Sky,' starring Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz.  At the age of thirty-three, David Aames (Cruise) inherits a publishing empire left to him by his father. His fifty-one percent controlling interest, however, has made him something of a marked man, as there are seven members of his board of directors, and each deems himself more worthy than the young Mr. Aames of the lion's share of the company.  And fueling the fires of discontent is their perception that David lacks the focus the job requires.",2001
9,"""The sweet is never as sweet without the sour."" This quote was essentially the theme for the movie in my opinion. Tom Cruise plays a young man who was handed everything in his life.

10,"I'm from Romania i'll try to speak in English. All i want to say about this movie is that it is and will be my all time number one. Seen it above 30 times at least and will see it for many years now. It has all the little things i like in a movie , it's very touching makes me cry . Shows a whole lot of twisted love things and questions about love and reality , and the true things that matter for different people. It so happens that for me this matters the most , the love , the soul of a man , he's inner being, and this i see in this movie. Perhaps for me it's much more than a motion picture , it's a proof in my mind that it could really exist and that you most make the best out of every moment you live with your soul mate. It's a long way from reality to sci-fi , but .. what if. What if all the capitalism disappeared and economy would go down , would fall? We would all be concerned about other issues and my thought is that , on your death bed , the bigger thing you remember , is not the wealth , not the adventure , not the countries you visited and the people that remember you. But the true friends and your true love and the hope that after you die , all will be god damn perfect and people would be good and care more. WATCH THIS MOVIE and probably it will guide you through your life like it did to me :) Hail from Romania",2007
10,"This film is one of Tom Cruise's finest films. He captures the audiences imaginations with his role of David Aames. His character can relate to us all in some way.The story line is very clever and keeps the audience on edge throughout the whole film. I never really watched Cruise movies that much before but after seeing this it shows me his true talent. My favourite part in the movie is the end where it all comes to a big conclusion and he find out the truth. If you have not seen this yet you definitely should give it a try. It's one of those films that once you've started watching it you just got to see it until the end or it will keep you thinking and you will regret it. My opinion is you should just go buy it and take a risk thats what I did and it became one of my favourite films of all time. It's A* 10/10 I promise once you watch it, it will stick with you and you will like it forever.",2006

9,"This movie consists of such great emotion especially with its outstanding soundtrack that coincides with the film. Tom Cruise is one of my favorite actors because of his enthusiasm to make films and to entertain. This movie was not the best the first time I watched it, but after about 3 more times I decided that this is one of the best films that I have ever seen. It takes place in New York, and progresses on through his lifestyle. He discovers a delimma in his life with his girlfriend (Diaz). He goes through a state of depression and then an outgoing blend of imagination. This film was beyond my expectations, and is one of Cruise's best films ever!",2006
1,"A remake of Alejandro Amenabar's Abre los Ojos, but this time with a living, breathing mask as a lead. For the dubious advantage of an English sound track, we endure Tom Cruise's soulless performance, as usual, with zero depth. Yes, the character is identified with his persona, but we usually are given some character underneath that to hold our interest. His empty posturing negates any erotic energy that could have been between his character and Cruz or Diaz.",2006
1,"This was the worst movie I saw last year, and I saw some doozies (Corky Romano, Freddy Got Fingered...)  That acting, directing, editing, and soundtrack to this film are all horrible.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.",2002
7,I`ve never seen the Spanish movie ABRE LOS OJOS on which VANILLA SKY is based but do recall that everyone who has seen the original European movie destest this Hollywood remake . I will be honest in saying that I absolutely loved this version first time I saw it . In fact it came close to beating BLACK HAWK DOWN as my second favourite release from 2001 ( FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING being my outstanding favourite movie from that year ) but then when I saw it a second time I was far less impressed ,2004
6,"If English speaking cinema-goers could learn how to read subtitles, we would be spared having to watch remakes of films that were made perfectly well in the first place. There is nothing particularly wrong with Crowe's version, and if it had been an original piece of work I would be hailing it as a challenging, left-field, atypical Hollywood product. However, comparison has to made with Amenabar's film, which in my opinion is superior in almost all aspects. The main protagonist of ""abre los ojos"", Cesar, is an unlikable character, whom it is difficult to warm to. Contrast this with Cruise's David, all of whose actions have some reason other than his being a spoilt playboy. Crowe, who is a filmmaker I admire, has lost all the ambiguity, and a good deal of the mystery, of the Spanish original. He spells out everything,as if a multiplex crowd could not be expected to draw its own conclusions, or even leave the theatre without any conclusion. I would compare this to ""Donnie Darko"", where the movie seemed so much better before everything was clarified on the DVD release. So my wish for Hollywood is to stop plundering other nations' film archives, and for English speakers to overcome their prejudices against movies in other languages.",2005
7,"The original ""Abre los ojos"" was a great but not perfect movie. It had a bit of a dragging beginning and especially middle-part. Unfortunately this remake suffers from the same problem and is even a bit worse with its dragging parts. In the first hour and an halve it's still mainly unclear where the movie is heading to and makes perhaps a bit of a pointless impression. Just like in the original, the ending compensates for this even though the ending for this movie isn't build up as a good and executed as in the original was the case. ",2005
8,"I saw this movie because I like Tom Cruise.  I feel he is a terrific actor. I never know that Keith Campbell was the actor who was in the scenes where Tom wore a mask and interacted with Kurt Russell.  Anyway, this movie is a love story intwined with some serious sci fi.  Tom Cruise plays a cocky 30 something year old who falls for Penelope Cruise (no relation to Tom......yet).  However, at one point Tom Cruise is in a horrible accident and must learn to live with his face all scarred up and disfigured.  The twists turn like crazy after this.  Jason Lee from DOGMA is superb as Tom's carefree friend.  The acting is great, the music is wonderful and the photography is unbelievable.  The end was criticized by many but I actually liked it.  Yes, this movie does deliver the goods.  7 thumbs up!",2002
3,"After a while, I finally got annoyed with ""Criminal Intent"". The main character, Detective Robert Goren, is all-wise, all-knowing, can give a psychiatric diagnosis in an instant, finds clues right away, regularly breaks suspects when there is no evidence available, etc. All this with his ""stuttering"" approach that just looks like bad acting. ",2006
6,"For me nothing beats the original LAW AND ORDER series. But Criminal Intent has sometimes great cases, great stories, where you really want to KNOW what's going on and why. Sadly what's really bothering me is how they are solved. It's OK to have a genius like Detective Robert Goren who is so much more clever than the usual detective or his partners. But he is an expert in EVERY little thing in the world, including special import candies from Europe and so on and so on. For me he is just an unbelievable character, no one can know everything. Always. He doesn't even have to sit down and study in a library, he just knows. Thats spoils the series a lot for me, cause solving the case is of course the main part of every episode. If just now and again he would be wrong in something....",2006
1,"This show actually sucks. And it sucks because of the premise, because of the exploitation of the lower instincts left in the human body and mostly because of the all knowing detective genius Vincent D'Onofrio. In the real life, no one from the law enforcement agency has any possible right to abuse, yell and rant at the suspect without any proves. In the real world the cases are not so easily solved. In the real world, perverts and criminals are all around us but unfortunately, undeservedly, they do not acknowledge crimes as soon as someone wise ass from the police begins yelling at them. Not all suspects are psychologically abused maniacs who are on the edge of their nerves just as to allow some wise ass to smash them at the interrogation room. It is not real. After a few episodes it becomes perfectly clear that it is mr Wolf who has won (the money), not the audience. Cope with that.",2007

5,"It is really difficult to express too strongly that the entire problem with this series can be expressed in two words: Vince D'Onofrio. I'm not sure whether it is that the man is an exquisitely awful actor, or whether he is extraordinarily skilled at playing a truly repulsive character, but either way seeing his meaty face is sufficient grounds to change the channel. Particularly repulsive is his endless macho posturing, his sarcastic bullying and general pomposity. All of which would be forgivable if we were not invited by the program to view Donofrio's character as an admirable guardian of justice rather than the thuggish fool projected by his behavior. Equally annoying is the way he plays his role. Comparing his manic, tic filled overacting to the simple, clean, mannerism free performances of Chris Noth is sufficient to illustrate the difference between a man who plays a role, and one who simply performs. With Vince D'Onofrio I am constantly aware that I am watching an actor playing a role, and in an extremely annoying manner. With Chris Noth I am simply watching an individual whom I like and care about cope with the difficulties of his profession. Please CI producers, dump D'Onofrio and make Chris Noth the central character of this show.",2006

I can just save someone else from being put through the awful ordeal of watching this stupid, unrealistic, repetitive, pretentious, obnoxious show. It seems this show is a home to all of the bad actors in Hollywood who cant get any other jobs. The plots are always boring, and to complicated to be portrayed in an hour properly. Vincent Denoffrio is abysmal (however is Oscar worthy compared to that thing playing his partner. I cant believe people actually enjoy these two actors. They're just annoying and phony and unwatchable. just stay away, and hopefully this show will be taken off the air forever.",2008

Now, I enjoyed the ""AP"" movies, and don't believe them to be crappy movies, but they possess no depth and substance. ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" is much more sexually explicit than those two films put together, but it's in no way exploitative.  It's a slice-of-life story involving teens, and who's gonna deny that 80 percent of a teenager's life revolves around sex?",2003

10,"Y tu mamá también offers an extreme insight into the rampant sexuality of Mexico's young adults. The film depicts lives of two teenage boys against the backdrop of present-day Mexico. In his film, Alfonso Cuarón not only describes the sexual experimentation of Mexican youth, but he also addresses the impact wavering politics and an unstable economy has on the Mexican people as a whole. ",2005
9,"What a funny, sexy, sad, wonderful movie. Gael Garcia Bernal is destined for greatness. I was totally overwhelmed by the sexual tension between the characters. It is also a subtle, yet brutal, comment on Latin culture as far as sex is concerned. The reaction of the two boys after realizing they have made love is purely Latin fear. In another part of the world, that night of love could have been the new beginning of a wonderful friendship. Cuaròn, the director, redeems himself here, after the embarrassing ""Great Expectations""",2004
7,"After watching this movie, I looked at what a few critics had to say about it and I was shocked to see some of them refer to this movie as a ""teen sex comedy"".  Wow, I didn't get that impression at all!  Yes, the movie is infused with sex, and the two lead characters are horny teens, and there are quite a few comedic moments, but this is far from a teen sex comedy.  It's treatment of the subject matter is real, for one thing, and backdrop of the Mexican countryside (and the director's detached observation's through third-person narration) bring some sobriety to the film.  Be warned, though: there is a lot of sex, so not exactly a movie you're going to want to watch with the in-laws.",2004

10,"The ""Coming of Age"" genre is so well worn, that when a movie like Y Tu Mama Tambien comes along, the frank authenticity can be jarring. Although the plot doesn't steer far away from convention, at each point the viewer's anticipation is deftly sidestepped, and the scene is injected with a dose of raw emotion that has little to do with Drama, and everything to do with reality. It is so refreshing to see characters behave in a way that resembles personal memory, if not actual experience.",2006
9,"Alfonso Cuaron's Y Tu Mama Bien is one of the better films of the year (not quite best, but still highly recommendable). Cuaron, who scripted with his brother Carlos, tells a story with such a level of stark and touching realism that the audience will not only feel for the three main characters, but will feel like their along the ride with them. In this story, Tenoch and Julio are two friends whose girlfriends go away to Italy for a little while and are left with not much to do (outside of partying and masturbation) until they get an idea to go to a secluded beach called Heaven's Mouth and ask the married and 10 years older Luisa to come along. She agrees after discovering her husband cheated on her more than she could stand and this takes the movie onto a road trip with dialog and actions that, despite having the be read on the bottom of the screen in subtitle format, is much better than most teen movies that go for sex related dialog (however, Cuaron had to go back to Mexico to make this type of movie so that the MPAA wouldn't s*** on it and make him re-edit it to a NC-17) and action.

Then when I read that Ivan Reitman, the BEST comedic director of the 80's and one of the best of all time was at the helm, I was thrilled.  I mean, come on, after he was given duds like `Father's Day' and `Six Days, Seven Nights' to work with, isn't it about time that Hollywood gave him a project worth while (I won't even mention the bombastic disaster of `Junior'oh, I just did)?",2001
8,"Evolution is a step up from most gross-out comedies. With a nice idea for a plot, it starts off quite serious before the stars show their comic talents off. David Duchovny has good comic timing that hasn't really been tapped before, Orlando Jones is far better here than in Double Take and Say It Isn't So and Seann William Scott is a damn fine comic actor who uses his goofy charm to his advantage. Julianne Moore's constant falling over isn't funny, but you can't have everything. It's a shame that it flopped in the US, because it's really good. The special effects are decent, the turns are likeable and the script is loaded with sharp wit.

But, the movie doesn't take itself seriously, and therefore if you watch it just for the fun of it, you won't be disappointed. David Duchovny is hilarious, poking fun at his character from the ""X-Files,"" Fox Mulder, and Seann William Scott is what you would expect, although I thought casting him in the ""American Pie"" movies was more appropriate. Otherwise, the actors were listless (Julianne Moore), or cliché (Orlando Jones). But it was worth seeing, and I admit I laughed.

Actually when I rented it, I was worried it might be some stupid movie with bad acting and bad directing, but I couldn't have been more wrong about it.  Orlando Jones was absolutely hilarious (who knew the 7-up guy could act so well), while David Duchovny added that ""off the wall"" dry humor which blended perfectly with Jones. And then to top it off, Julianne Moore's (from Hannibal) character was hysterical in an offbeat style as well.  As for Sean William Scott, he basically played the same role he usually plays in all of his movies, the ""idiot"", but nobody in acting pulls that off as well as he does.  He's a riot!  Granted, this movie is not Saving Private Ryan or The Green Mile, but for a cheesy comedy that is just supposed to make you laugh, it's at the top of it's genre.",2002

2,"My totally negative critical opinion of director Ivan Reitman's ""Evolution"" has nothing to do with Charles Darwin. This sophomoric aliens-vs.-humans comedy with ""X-Files"" defector David Duchovny battling carnivorous extraterrestrials never evolves beyond its amoebic humor, its cretinous characters, and its Petri dish deep plot. Indeed, campy 1950s B-movie sci-fi classics, like ""The Giant Gila Monster"" or ""The Killer Shrews,"" deliver more laughs per minute than this feeble, uninspired potboiler. Okay, some of the gross-out gags may prompt a snicker, but you won't split your sides howling with hilarity like you might have done at Reitman's original ""Ghostbusters."" Imagine a ""Ghostbusters"" trio of heroes combating aliens gone AWOL from ""Men In Black,"" ""Tremors,"" ""Gremlins,"" and ""Jurassic Park,"" and you have a fairly accurate idea how wholly derivative and hopelessly predictable this lame creature feature is.

3,"What a great film this could have been!  The recreation of the attack on Pearl Harbor is some of the best film-making ever - an extraordinary and moving sequence made utterly believable by state of the art special effects. It ranks up there with the opening sequence from ""Saving Private Ryan"" and the sinking of the ""Titanic"" as one of the most harrowing ""disaster"" sequences filmed in recent years.  But like both those other two films, PEARL HARBOR is desperately in need of a decent script to frame the disaster sequence.",2001
1,"I heard about this film while it was in production. I heard about how they were going to go out of their way to get all the right aircraft to film so things would look right. I heard how they wanted everything to look as authentic as possible. I heard that the movie would somehow encompass the Battle of Britain, Pearl Harbor, and the Doolittle Raid (??? - an early warning sign). I heard that they were going to stage the premiere on an aircraft carrier moored in Pearl Harbor, for an audience of Second World War veterans. They even managed to get one of the veterans attending the premiere to say complimentary things about the movie. I knew that special effects technology had advanced enormously since 1970, allowing the filming of things that would have been impossible in the previous big-budget movie about Pearl Harbor, Tora Tora Tora.",2008
3,"OK the action sequences are fantastic, the music is wonderful & gripping, the Pearl Harbor attack was intense, it was at many points very emotional and made you a bit teary eyed because you feel for all the brave men & women who died on that faithful day in December 1941. Now lets get down to why this is movie failed miserably: ",2008
1,"When previews for this movie began to appear in theatres, I was excited. I mean REALLY excited.

1,"John Hartnett and Ben Affleck star as dashing (as opposed to merely ""runny"") pilots in love with the same woman, a for the time surprisingly anorexic model type played by Kate Beckinsale. This love triangle gets so convoluted and unbelievable throughout the film that one almost expects Hartnett and Affleck to end up together, or possibly even a sexy soft-core three-way (Beckinsale: ""Oh... I just can't decide between the two of you, so I'll have you BOTH!"").",2003

1,"I saw Pearl Harbor because I heard that there was a 90 minute battle sequence when the Japanese attack the infamous Navy port. What I didn't realize was that there was another 90 minutes of complete BS surrounding that one fight scene. Yes, some moments were spectacular visually, but the rest of the movie was not only bad, but offensively bad. In fact, the way that the entire thing is portrayed is a love story and not even a good love story at that. Right away we know that Affleck gets together with Beckinsdale and then his partner betrays him and has sex with her. So, she's pregnant and their friendship is on the line and they have to decide who'll marry her etc. Oh yeah, and the Japanese attack at some point. ",2006
1,"I wasn't too concerned about historical accuracies of films which are based on true events, as long as they were kept to a minimum, but this movie changed my mind. Michael Bay completely changed the events of Pearl Harbor. ",2006
4,"Put extremely attractive young men and women into the fashions of 1941 but with the moral attitudes of the 21st century, add special effects, completely throw out any basis in actual fact in order to get an emotional reaction from the audience (here the film succeeds for all the wrong reasons), add a few rousing speeches, and you have Pearl Harbor. The only good thing about this film are the special effects, and even then I prefer the more primitively done Tora,Tora,Tora from thirty years before because it actually tells the truth about what led up to the raid in painstaking detail, actually taking the time to show what is going on with both the Japanese and the Americans and the mistakes and misjudgments made on both sides.

2,There are very few films I've come across which actually make you want to beat yourself senseless with a heavy object. But this is surely one of them.

10,"I'm an American and let me say that the majority of television shows in America aimed for children and teenagers are full of CRAP!!! Once in a while there would be a comedy show that tried doing a special episode (drugs, racism, school shootings) while making the characters more retarded than the common person. Degrassi: The Next Generation on the other hand, is a show from Canada in which it deals with various teenagers coping with life while in high school. There are too many topics going on in every teenagers life ranging from Internet predators, sex scandals, school shootings, discrimination, murder, drugs, rape, pedophilia, coming out of the closet, framing people, jealously, etc., that there's not enough time to deal with all topics. Degrassi is the type of show that handles every situation very well along with making sure that the characters aren't stereotypes from Saved by The Bell or any Disney Channel show. I don't know why some people complain that this is a show taken itself way too seriously, believe it or not, they are showing what it's like in real life to be a teenager put in dangerous situations.",2007
6,"Degrassi is one of my favorite televisions shows still airing today. It centers around a bunch of Canadian teenagers attending Degrassi Community School in Ontario, Canada. The age groups of the students seem to be from between 14-18, and it documents the real-life hardships and problems that many kids deal with in the world today (e.g., relationships, eating disorders, drugs, growing up...).",2011
10,"This show is my favorite show! I started watching it b/c I was a fan of the latest buzz (another Canadian show) and I saw that a lot of people were on both shows. I personally think that America is really slacking in teen shows! I am a teen and a lot of the shows on Disney and nick just aren't really realistic! This show really shows what it's like to be in high school, and all the characters are believable. I think the show has a lot more realistic characters now, and some more interesting ones like Eli and Adam. I'm glad there is at least one show out there that isn't afraid to show the issues real teens face. I am an obsessive watcher of this show, and I think all teens should get to watch it.",2011
8,"It's been eight years since I first started watching Degrassi. At the age of eleven I stumbled upon the show. I will admit I was a little young at the time to be watching it but I was instantly hooked, I could relate to the storyline and the younger characters like Toby, Jt, Emma, and Manny at the time. Now at nineteen it is still amazing to me that the show is still able to connect to my life. It is truly a show of my childhood, characters have come and gone, some believe that has ruined the show. In my opinion that has only kept the show fresh and lively. Degrassi is the show for about teens for teens, there is no sugar coating reality story lines fit to appease parents. You probably can't name too many issues facing teens that Degrassi hasn't covered. From rape, religion, sex, drugs, eating disorders, love, bullying, cheating, coming of age, money, and this list goes on and on. Degrassi has gone there since the first episode, I consider them one of the first to showcase true teen lives. The show has been doing this for years versus new shows that just began popping up for teens.",2011

5,"Degrassi has changed so much, Degrassi has gone from a comedy, romance, and thriller. To just a romance. I mean you use to be able to see Holly J and the cheer squad go out for a girls night out, and it started out fun and they have laughs and then the drama starts. Yet at the end there's something that have you on the edge of your seat. I mean even when Jane cheated on Spinner with Declan there was laughter soon around the corner. ",2011

It's really an adorable movie that is appropriate for any age....a very light PG-13.",2006
9,"Don't judge a book by it's cover.  An old saying we've all heard so many times it doesn't seem to mean anything anymore.  But it does mean something, and it's important; and, before we proceed, go back and read it again.  In fact, let me help you:  Don't judge a book by it's cover.  There.  Now take a moment to think, really think about it.  And if it still doesn't mean anything, take a couple of hours and check out `Legally Blonde,' a comedy with some real teeth in it, directed by Robert Luketic and starring Reese Witherspoon.  The premise of the story has to do with upscale sorority girl Elle Woods (Witherspoon), who instead of getting the long awaited, much anticipated marriage proposal from her boyfriend, Warner (Matthew Davis), finds herself jilted as he prepares to leave for Harvard Law School.  Elle, it seems, just doesn't fit the oh-so-serious, somber profile that the wife of a future Senator must have.  It's all about image, and Elle's own 4.0 grade average earned in her `frivolous' curriculum apparently doesn't carry any weight.  Being outgoing, positive, beautiful AND intelligent just won't do among the `serious' of the `upper crust' elite.  So, because she looks good and enjoys her life, Elle is given the gate, and she just can't understand why.  She's devastated.  But she's also smart.  Smart enough to pick herself up and make a decision that stands them all on their ears. With the grades and the wherewithal to swing it, she enters Harvard Law herself, initially with the intent of winning back Warner.  But along the way she  learns something important-- about the way things really are, about people and about herself, as well.  And she sets out to prove that if there is any `shallowness' around, it's only in the minds of those who perceive her as something and someone other than what she really is.  And, for the viewer, right out of the gate this is someone you want to see succeed in her quest, because her triumph-- whatever it may be or however it comes out-- is going to be one you share right along with her.",2001
8,"Legally Blonde finds Reese Witherspoon in one of her breakthrough roles as sorority queen Elle Woods who is dumped by her preppy boyfriend Matthew Davis. He's moving on to Harvard Law School where he will get his law degree, marry a woman of good background in Selma Blair and claim the family legacy of public office. So there's no time for his homecoming queen Reese although I'm sure he'd arrange something on the side later.",2008
10,"From the opening credits and Hoku's superb 'Perfect Day' (even had me dancing) to the very last shot, this film never disappoints. It may be totally fantastic, slushy nonsense but the 'feel-good' factor is high and once again, Witherspoon gives a flawless performance. As my other reviews will show, I do have a bit of a thing for Ms W. - and Selma Blair - partly because I know any movie with which they're involved will be worthy viewing. They have very different qualities and this is exploited to the full in their on-screen rivalry.",2006

4,"The heroine of this film is Elle Woods, an undergraduate studying fashion design at a Californian university. Elle is rather cruelly dumped by her ruthlessly ambitious upper-class boyfriend, Warner Huntington III, who has just been accepted by Harvard Law School and intends to be a Senator by the time he is 30. Warner considers that Elle is insufficiently serious and intellectual to marry a man like himself; as he puts it ""I need a Jackie, not a Marilyn"". (What Warner fails to consider is that, with Marilyn Monroe as a potential First Lady, JFK might have been elected by a landslide instead of having to rely on highly contentious results in Illinois and Texas to put him in the White House).",2007
7,"""Legally Blonde"" is all about Witherspoon as a totally val blonde from Beverly Hills who goes to Harvard and makes good. Predictable formula fun, ""LB"" gets off to a good start with the freshness of ""Clueless"", pushes its own envelope of believability in the middle, and ends with a major feel good moment. Along the way, this fun family flick makes some good points about life's priorities. Enjoyable stuff for 13 and up.",2001
6,"A bimbo becoming a top lawyer: only in Hollywood!! That's the premise here and a winsome Reese Witherspoon pulls it off in a charming way, which she would have to do to make this ludicrous story watchable.

In an era PC baloney, at least this film pokes fun at everyone, not just select groups.",2006

7,"Legally Blonde (2001): Dir: Robert Luketic / Cast: Reese Witherspoon, Luke Wilson, Selma Blair, Victor Garbor, Jennifer Coolidge: Comedy about misconceptions and reels them around to finger point the accuser. It stars Reese Witherspoon as a none too bright blonde who is full of life. In her senior year of college she anticipates a proposal from her boyfriend but is met with rejection when she states the need for a serious relationship. She decides to win him back by attending Harvard Law School as he did. Directed by Robert Luketic with a hilarious performance by Witherspoon who pretty much carries the film. With her inability to fit in and her frilly pink fashion she uses her own wit in dealing with a crucial case. Luke Wilson is the obvious love interest who will assist her with the case and he can do nothing to bring life into it. Selma Blair plays the serious girl engaged to her ex-boyfriend. She is typical and totally lifeless. Victor Garbor and Jennifer Coolidge are two veterans that cannot elevate above where Witherspoon thankfully takes it. Witherspoon is the only element that presents any fresh vibe to this recycled story. We learn that success does not rest on another person. Where this whole dumb blonde bit originated is not known but this comedy stresses that it isn't the colour of your hair that make the grade but a better screenplay might have helped. Score: 7 ½ / 10",2015
7,"""Legally Blonde"" may not be the funniest movie I've ever seen, but it might just be the most cheerful one. Everything about it is just so damn sparkly. If you can watch this movie without cracking a smile, you're somehow even more of a cynical bastard than I am. The story isn't too inspired and you see pretty much every plot element coming from a mile away but who the hell cares, that's just the movie's way of staying in your comfort zone. Of course she's going to choose the right guy in the end, of course she's going to win the case: nobody would want it any other way. Even Jennifer ""what the face"" Coolidge can't ruin this movie, that's how charming it really is. Prepare to fall in love.",2012
10,"""Legally Blonde"" rates as one of the best 'chick flicks.' This clever,sophisticated, but above all hilarious, fish-out-of-water comedy concerns a shunned sorority doll who refuses to take ""no"" from her boyfriend after he dumps her. Elle (Reese Witherspoon) is the smartest Delta Nu Sorority sister and she decides to follow her ex-boyfriend Warner Huntington,III to Harvard Law School. No sooner has Elle arrived than she is made the butt of jokes. Warner's fiancée Vivian invites Elle to a party and lies that it is a costume party. Appropriately, Elle shows up as a Playboy Bunny and realizes that she has made a complete fool of herself. Eventually, Elle meets to kindred souls, a sympathetic law student Emit (Luke Wilson of ""Home Fries"") and Paulette, a manicurist. A stuffy Harvard professor Callahan (Victor Garber)assigns Elle to be a part of the defense team with Brooke Taylor Windham (Ali Larter of ""Final Destination"") who is charged with killing her wealthy husband Heyworth. Eventually, Callahan makes a pass at Elle and she quits. Brooke fires Callahan and has Elle takes over the case. She uses her knowledge of fashion and hair care to exonerate her client. As it turns out, Heyworth's jealous daughter shot him because she found it disgusting that Brooke was her age. Elle graduates with top honors while Warner gets by without honors. The romance between Paulette and the UPS delivery man is amusing. Reese Witherspoon bares wattage with a winning smile.",2012
7,"I thought ""oh no - another dumb teen movie"", but I was pleasantly surprised. The main character is extremely likable, and you can feel sorry for her plight - once you get over her superficiality she appears to have at the beginning.  I am not usually a fan of such movies, but found this one to be acceptable.  (Then again maybe it's because I watched the horrible ""All the pretty horses"" just before viewing this and anything would have looked good.)",2002
9,"Saying this is a good movie may not sound like much, but after watching all the other summer movies, this is a breath of fresh air. Reese Witherspoon is proving to be one of the best young actors of our time and she makes this movie something fun to see.  Other than ""The Sexy Beast"", this was one movie that was any good so far this summer.",2001
10,"Wow! The main thing I can say about it is, ""You go, Reese!"" There was only one person that I hated throughout most of the film, and that was Vivian (Selma Blair). The reason I hated her throughout most of the film was because she was really snobby! Even though I had that negative thought about her throughout most of the film, I thought this film was really funny, charming, witty, and sweet. It was especially funny during the trial of Brooke Taylor-Windham (Ali Larter). Also, even though Elle (Reese Witherspoon) acted a little crazy at times, I thought she did, indeed, have a lot more legal savvy than she thought she did. In conclusion, if you're a fan of Reese Witherspoon, I highly recommend LEGALLY BLONDE! You're in for a good time and a lot of laughs, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, and see it today.",2005

10,"From the very first episode to the series' final moment, 'Alias' never failed to keep me on the edge of my seat. Dramatic, funny, thrilling, action-packed and smart, it brings you through so many twists and turns that you may have to come up for air once in a while, but will undoubtedly find yourself diving in for more. Three years after its conclusion 'Alias' still remains my favorite show, thanks to a stellar cast, gripping score, intelligent writers and great production values; with the lovely Jennifer Garner being the glue that holds it all together, and of course, the brainchild behind it all, J.J. Abrams. Part James Bond, part Indiana Jones, Garner's Sydney Bristow is a hero for the ages.

10,"I simply cannot understand anyone who slates this show, unless perhaps they simply were not intelligent enough to follow it's superbly complex and intricate story. The immaculate acting of both Victor Garber and Ron Rifkin alone should be enough for anyone, but the incredible plot twists and threads, superb character development and, dare I mention it, exciting action sequences too, just add to this outstanding show.",2008
1,"I was quite amused by the first series of Alias and am now ploughing through series 4, having seen the quality drop remorselessly since the opening. Excess can be amusing in moderation but not episode after episode after ... I was interested to see what happened with Rambaldi but I think I realise now nothing ever will; we will just continue going round in circles since any form of conclusion will kill any form of suspense however minute. I now watch it looking to see how many times they use the word protocol (loved the inferno protocol - hard to top that for over-thetopness) and to see if the actors will surprise me with a new expression beyond their stock-in-trade bemusement (Vaughan), bewilderment (Jack Bristow) etc. Hard to blame the actors when the script is so inane and one-dimensional. It reminds me constantly of the parody-line in Notting Hill ""inform the pentagon we need black star cover"". The whole script is full of this line over and over. And for a bunch of supposedly mentally toughened CIA agents they do fall apart when family comes up. It is clear if Sydney (or anyone else for that matter) were to find out her mother had been hurt she would either break down in tears (to a suitable song of course) or raze the whole of the USA to find the antidote. I also carry in my mind a (slight mis-)quote from the end of episode one which I am still waiting for Jack Bristow to say; it sort of sums up the experience so far in this show where nothing is as it seems yet everything is totally predictable - ""Sydney, I'm not your father, I'm your mother"".",2006
3,"Having watched all five seasons, the only reason i did that was because i watched season 4 & 5 first so i had to watch the first three for closure. All i can say is that i was really impressed with season 4 & 5 i think they were really well made however the preceding seasons were ill conceived and patronising to anyone with real sense. This was starting to look more and more like a Steven Seagal flick (only worse this is a series) all the baddies are so generic they are either waiting to have their asses kicked or get hypnotized into giving up intel by Jennifer garner garner's hot body i can't say i am really surprised since the creator is none other than J.J Abrams THE SAME MAN RESPONSIBLE FOR LOST which like alias had a lot of potential but like its predecessor is bricking itself in by trying to overstretch a concept. Any way back to Alias the thing i find most frustrating are 1) Arvin Sloane's implied sense of evil, honestly for a man who is supposed to be so evil i expected gut wrenching evidence of his villainy without this evidence i find it hard to detest this man, in fact i find myself drawn to him and in most cases rooting for him to do something to cement his credibility all ending in disappointment.",2007
5,"ALIAS is the drama series I could never decide whether to be loved or hated. Probably one the most entertaining shows I've ever seen on TV, but also one of the biggest disappointments in my life. Now, how comes that? Arguably, Alias is a great example on how to ruin a drama show that started out with such a great potential. Not with a ground-breakingly original idea (the show obviously resembles La Femme Fatale Nikita and dozens of similar espionage stories), but with its interesting characters and slightly unrealistic but rather clever story lines and plot twists, it DOES manage to get you hooked, after just a few episodes (provided you get to see the right episodes). It sounds good so far, so what the hell went wrong?",2008
10,"Although Alias may not be correct in everything it displays, what TV show is? it has everything a good series should have; action, romance, and characters that aren't idiots. Each character delivers something new and different to the screen. The plot is always moving and it's hard to tell where it's going, so when you arrive.. it's a complete surprise! With unending twists and turns, never knowing good characters from bad, the viewer simply falls into the plot and feels like they, instead of Sydney, are the main character. The only thing bad to say about the series is it sometimes takes a bit too much time to get into the plot- especially at the beginning of season 1. but, continue in and you'll find a series worth watching, a series worth buying and collecting.",2008

It should've been cancelled after the second season because what they offered was b.s.",2006

Though the story line did get side tracked and was most of the time too confusing for new viewers to catch on, Alias was a weekly ritual for fans. Jennifer Garner was gorgeous and the genius JJ Abrams himself never ceased to wow fans with action and thrills. One of the best things about the show I believe was the way Sydney (Jennifer Garner) was forced to balance her life of being an agent and keeping her cover. How she handles love, betrayal, and lies makes the show an absolute joy to watch. My advise to those people who have heard of this show but are looking for opinions......rent the first season and you'll be hooked to watched to watch the following 4. Happy watching!",2008

9,"I like this film a lot, but of course it suffers - as all sequels do - by comparison to its predecessor, in this case 'Silence of the Lambs' The main reason for having a sequel at all was to showcase again the character of Hannibal Lecter, a monstrous creation everyone wanted to see more of after the first film. It could have bombed badly therefore if writer and actor had let us down by failing to catch the magic again. It was after all a decade after the original was made. But they don't, and Anthony Hopkins turns in another delicious performance as the man with the evil intent cloaked in inestimable, menacing charm.",2006

While a little unevenly paced (the beginning was a bit slow), David Mamet and Steve Zallian have done a good job of telling the basic story Thomas Harris gave to us - and, incidently, the book was incredibly underrated by critics whose thought processes seem to have been damaged by too little quality literature. People have complained that it took ten years for Harris to write it - well, read it! It is chock-a-block full of mythology, astronomical and religious themes that weave their way throughout. The threads never break. The movie would have had to be eight hours long to even begin to explore the depths plumbed by Harris in the book.",2001

1,"*Hannibal SPOILERS* Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) is back... for a travesty of a movie! Now he's in Italy, appreciating our food (including people, such as Rinaldo Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini)), but comes back to the States for Clarice (Julianne Moore) and to even the score with a former victim, Mason Verger (Gary Oldman).",2007
5,"Yup, they did it again. Between the sanitized ending: agent Starling became a cannibal in the book but is an unconvincing righteous crusader in this turkey (an essential and main theme the author uses throughout his books is what makes a truly great detective is their ability to think and be somewhat of the same cloth as those they hunt) and the miscast Julianne Moore who really stinks up the scenes with her phony flat floundering; Hollywood has killed another serial. Sir Anthony gives a fine performance with the flawed material he was given and Gary Oldman and Ray Liotta and some others are all excellent but they cannot keep this vessel from missing the mark completely. Once again the Hollywood execs involved with this have kept their jobs by hiring all the ""right"" people, so even if it had bombed at the box office they could claim they were not responsible because they hired all the ""right"" people. Unfortunately not enough of them were the right ones for this specific job. Besides one of the essential leads being a terrible and inappropriate choice, Ms. Moore, the integral story changes were idiotically formulaic, essentially burning all the bridges for thought the author had built and that had been kept intact in ""The Silence of the Lambs"" movie. Did Mamet REALLY write this? Or is he just the writer of record and it was destroyed by too many cooks (other writers) fooling around with the recipe? Why does Hollywood always do this? If a theme is ""too dark"" or ""too depressing"" do a different film for chrissake. Don't destroy the heart of something to make it more palatable for the bland masses. Hey I have an idea, instead of Dr. Lecter being a serial killer let him be a man who likes to eat lots of CEREAL. Yeah, that way you can make this into a cartoon for kids on Saturday morning too! Think of the marketing possibilities, tying it in with Cheerios or how about LIFE cereal? Wow, maybe the studio execs missed their chance to REALLY cash in. Shhhh, very quietly now, don't repeat this, otherwise the remake they do because they're all too cowardly to try a real new theme but instead rehash proved ""box office"" that they ""rewrite"" for the masses will be worse than what I just said.",2007
4,"Wild boars, a man with no face and a nearly superhuman cannibal fugitive... this movie should have been called ""Horrible"" instead of ""Hannibal."" Take a perfectly good psychological thriller franchise and run it into the ground dug out by the over-the-counter sensationalized shock-horror motion pictures, and you have Hannibal. This movie uses the same subplots and horrific visuals that Silence of the Lambs used masterfully to convey suspense and horror and instead achieves only cheap gasps and smirks. Startling characters with over-done makeup, dungeon lighting in benign environments, and extravagant mansions and other unbelievable settings place this movie far out of the reach of Silence of the Lambs, a movie that planted a seed of fear in the minds of every viewer and allowed that seed to root and flourish with masterful storytelling, character development, acting and proper use of visuals. The tangible idea of a ""serial killer next door"" from Silence of the Lambs is completely washed out in Hannibal. If you watch this movie and want to enjoy it, don't compare it to Silence; don't expect a plot that lingers in the depths of your own fears, merely watch it with your brain removed and placed on the seat beside you (spoiler not intended).",2005
1,"Hollywood has churned out yet another garbage that's wildly overhyped and underwhelming on a first-time viewing basis. Hannibal is bad, terrible, inept, lame, droll, idiotic, contrived, laughable and utterly atrocious (no pun intended). Minor spoilers follow...",2001
5,"Not so much a movie as a corporate offensive with the single goal of (what else) milking a franchise literally ... to death. OMG. Look at the talent in front of, and behind, the camera. Seriously. There are enough big names here to start another Hollywood. Ridley Scott, at a stage in his career (before Prometheus, for example) when his name was essentially a brand of its own. Screenplay by Mamet? How often does THAT happen? You have to believe that, to hook him into this project, a convoy of Brinks trucks carrying large, non-sequential, bills was somehow involved. Gary Oldman, one of the most accomplished character actors of all time. And of course they could not do the film without bringing back Sir Anthony, again, one of the greatest actors of the era, and at a stage in his career when his name as well was virtually a guarantee of quality (before the Odin-sleep, for example). What could go wrong?",2014
1,"I don't write many reviews here but having treated myself to watching the DVD of ""Silence of the Lambs"" the previous night, i thought i'd watch ""Hannibal"" again tonight. Now i first saw H at the movies on it's release, i wasn't overly impressed but i actually bought the DVD when it was released as i felt i may have missed something. Well after my third viewing this evening i have to say i've wasted nearly 6 hours of my life on a movie that has absolutely no redeeming features. I will never view it again. The scriptwriters when faced with a selection of some of the most unpleasant characters ever submitted to film resorted to some extremely lazy options. It's like they said ""OK we have to make Hannibal the anti hero here, but he maims and kills quite a few innocents, any ideas? Well we could make the Italian policeman corrupt, make him shop in Hannibal all for the sake of a few bucks rather than going through the correct authorities, yeah that would work. How about this Verger geezer, he was mutilated by Lectors sadism and now wants revenge.I know lets make him a paedophile, brilliant. Oh and just for kicks lets turn Clarice into a dumb broad who makes one stupid decision after another, man we've nailed it, surefire hit."" I cannot fathom how anyone gets anything out of this film, i enjoyed Silence and Red Dragon and to a lessor degree Manhunter, they were all intelligent to at least a reasonable level. Hannibal is schlock horror and has nothing bar beautiful cinematography in it's favour. Of the many, many DVDs i own Hannibal is going right to the bottom of the stack and will never see the light of day again.",2011
5,I don`t know if it existed in the novel of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS but the impression I got from that film was that Clarice Starling was very uncomfortable in the presence of men . This character trait is totally ignored in HANNIBAL as the film opens with Agent Starling asleep in a police van surrounded with men and as the film continues we see that the Clarice Starling of this version is a strong willed and assertive woman at odds with the timid insecure girl of the 1991 film . I guess some people may say this is character development but I`d call it a lack of internal continiuty and I wasn`t too happy with the way the character was underused either.,2003
10,"While hard to compare to its predecessor (Silence of the Lambs was a true masterpiece) the reintroduction of Hannibal Lecter, M.D. has truly been worth the 10 year wait.",2001
1,"I have witnessed some atrocities of cinema. In the past couple of years, it seems producers and directors are bent on making films that drive me closer and closer to insanity. Hannibal was not an exception. I wasn't expecting much, when I went in to see the movie. The book was ridiculous, and the saying, ""The Book is always better than the movie"" did not assure me at all that this movie would be anything but trash. But what I came to see was a movie that made all other bad movies seem better in comparison.",2001
1,"I never remember once even thinking about laughing as I watched Silence of the Lambs.  I giggled a lot at Hannibal.  In short, the movie lacked focus, showed us too much of Lecter, and had no suspense what so ever.  I could not have cared less.  I have heard the book was pretty bad too.",2001
3,"Cant think of anything good to say about this utterly unbelievable film except of course Anthony Hopkins. Ray Liotta and Gary Oldham's characters are pointless and their immense talents wasted. But the rotten cherry on top was a terribly cast ""Clarice"" played by Julianne Moore. Her one dimensional, stoic and unlikable ""tough guy"" personality doomed this film from the beginning. My closest comparison is Patrick Stewart vs William Shatner playing Star Trek's Capt Kirk. Shatner being multi dimensional, likable, smiles, and even occasionally vulnerable and flawed. Stewart being the polar opposite. ",2014
5,"This sequel to the seminal Silence of the Lambs is a mixed meal. At times gripping, thrilling and beautiful, at other times it is confusing, slow and clumsy. One of the best parts of the film is Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter, he IS Hannibal and whilst not as menacing, intelligent or as complex as he is in 'Silence', he is none-the-less one of the film's stronger points. ",2012
3,"Manhunter and ""Lambs"" did make an effort not only to concentrate on the fascination for evil and morbidity and really tried to construct an investigation, a plot, something of a certain solidity. Its successor (and last episode of the Hannibal series in chronological order) is nothing but a work of blood. Moreover, even if fascination does work on me, I cannot grant an ounce of realism to the Hannibal character. Forgive this incongruous comparison : Batman is able to do justice because he's neurotic, traumatized by the murder of his parents ans wealthy enough to develop his arsenal on his war on crime ; I could believe in Batman in reality. In Lecter, I cannot. In the pictures, he shows a high sense of refinery in the arts, music and paintings ; he despises those he considers vulgar and low. Yet, the persona of Clarice Starling did manage to reveal his sociable side ; ambiguous love story ? I don't think that even Thomas Harris knows himself. Harris just made an important effort in creating a paradoxical man/monster. What puzzles us is that he's cultivated and capable of the most atrocious crimes of flesh at the same time ; in brief, he's not like the real life serial killers. Is he really a serial killer by the way ? What motivates his murders ? His personal freedom when he butchers those who hold him prisoner, but the others ? On what bases does he kill ? Despise for rudeness ? Bordedom generated by the petty tales his patients tell him ? Simply a hobby ? Even the story of his childhood remains superficial in answer to these mysteries. Hannibal Lecter is just a romanesque serial killer, exactly as James Bond is an idealized secret agent capable of speaking several languages and of many other things. This absence of credibility really makes it impossible for me to enjoy this film. Norman Bates or Leatheface are far from exaggerated, next to him.",2009
4,"The first half or so of the film made me very disappointed, I really enjoyed The Silence of the Lambs, but this was quite boring. The second half of the movie was better tho, maybe a little too gory, but also beautiful and finally made me recognize it as a sequel to The Silence of the Lambs. I really preferred Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling, this Julianne Moore frankly sucks.",2002

10,"Until now I couldn't bring myself to believe that computer animation was the equal of either stop motion animation or hand-drawn animation.  All computer animated films looked a little (usually more than a little) too sterile, many were animated poorly (""Antz"", ""Shrek"", ""Final Fantasy""), and even the single unqualified success (""Toy Story 2"") provided little evidence that a computer animated film COULD reach the heights other kinds of animation could.  ""Toy Story 2"" had flawless character animation, but nothing as inspired as the best in ""Tarzan"" (released the same year, although I could have chosen almost any other Disney cartoon to make my point); effective art direction, but nothing to match ""Fantasia"" or ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"".  And I thought that ""Toy Story 2"" was as good as the art was ever going to get.",2002
10,"Pixar is the best! Of them all, Monsters, Inc. takes the cake. The realism of the characters' movements & feelings is perfect. The ending is a tear jerker on a happy note. At first I was concerned with the plot of monsters scaring children with a ""business as usual"" attitude, but right away you discover that the monsters are as terrified of the kids as the kids are of monsters.... wonderful juxtaposition throughout the film... a totally enjoyable, feel-good story. Buy it for the kids and let them watch it over and over. (adults may want to sit-in on more than one occasion themselves). Personal Note: For me, a mystery about this film was ""Roz""; the voice reminded me so strongly of the grandmother in ""Dinosaurs"", and I thought the character drawing was similar as well; upon researching the two, I found they are definitely different actors.",2005
9,"This is a very entertaining animated film. I've seen it twice and enjoyed even more the second time. Billy Crystal said he enjoyed making this film as much as any film he's ever done, so that's a good testimony that you'll get some laughs and enjoy this movie as an adult, too. ",2006

10,There's A Monster in My Closet!,2005
10,"This film is great. It made me laugh out loud and made me feel sad when I was supposed to too. The monsters all live in a city called Monstropolis and they need the screams of children to power everything. Sully (the big blue furry monster) is the top scarer and he and his one-eyed green friend Mike work together at ""Monsters, Incorporated"" gathering screams. The monsters are terrified of the children however, thinking that if they get touched by a child they will die. One of the children (she ends up being known as Boo) gets into the monster world and everyone goes into a panic. Sully and Mike must return her to her home before she gets caught. Boo is a cute little character and that's a lot coming from me (I am not a huge fan of small children - it may be because she isn't real). There is also an evil creepy monster called Randal who is planning on kidnapping children to harvest as much scream as possible. The animation was great, I am always amazed at the patience that must go into animating hair, Sully is very hairy. As with all Pixar films there are ""bloopers"" during the credits which were really funny. With some of the rubbish that Disney seems to be coming out with (Little Mermaid 2, Jungle Book 2 anyone?), Disney/Pixar has to be the wave of the future.",2005
10,"This movie is one of the most brilliant, creative and intelligent animated movies of all time, along with all the other Pixar Animation Studios' Movies. The characters are hilarious (Billy Crystal as Mike Wazowski and John Goodman as Sulley was brilliant) and heartfelt, and the movie exposes raw sensitivity with the separation of Sulley and Boo. The animation is incredible, the humor is witty and the storyline is flawless. This movie should be seen by any Pixar fan, Billy Crystal or Goodman fan, or anyone who just plain likes funny movies, lighthearted ones. Pixar, you've done it again, made a brilliant epic masterpiece! Congrats! Watch out for another appearance by John Ratzenberger (Hamm, P.T.Flea etc.). Hint: Himalayas! Overall, loved it! And I can't see why anyone else wouldn't either. Something for everyone!",2006
10,"As I'm 20 years old I wasn't very enthusiastic when one of my friend's brought Monsters Inc over to watch one night. I've never been into what I once thought were kids movies. I couldn't get into A Bug's Life or the Toy Story movies (though they were just as well-made) but when I saw Monsters Inc I was amazed. The colours are beautiful and the monsters actually have individual personalities that you can form an opinion about. My personal favourite is Sully - the way the bond grows between him and Boo is wonderful to watch, and he's such a tender, caring character. It's the only animated movie that has ever truly moved me - the ending brought a tear to my eye. I cannot find any fault with this movie and I fell in love with it the first time I saw it. I'm now the proud owner of the DVD and it's definitely one of my favourite movies ever. Anyone who hasn't seen it should - it's brilliant.",2003

10,Great family film. One of the most underrated movies of the year. I took my 2 year old to see it. He loved it! He now has books and toys of Mike and Sully! This movie will be going into our library. We can't wait for the DVD release in September 2002!,2002
9,"First came Toy Story. It was cute, but lacked bite. The technology was new, and Pixar was still experimenting. Next came A Bug's Life. It was remarkable. Then came Toy Story 2. Even better! Now here is their fourth feature: Monsters Inc. I'm not sure that it's better than Toy Story 2, but at the very least it's equal. It doesn't compare with that film in terms of hilarity. Toy Story 2, in my opinion, is one of the funniest films of the past several years, if not the funniest. However, Monters Inc. has a couple of advantages over TS2 (and, I promise you, it is at least as funny as any other film from 2001). First, the animation is even better than TS2. What? What did you say? Shrek? Ugh, don't even mention that waste of hard-drive space. Monsters Inc. is simply gorgeous in its color schemes. And the movement of the characters is so smooth it looks almost as if it were just the best stop-motion animation ever created. In the film, there is a Japanese restaurant that the monsters go to that's named after the great stop-motion master Roy Harryhausen. I'm sure he'd be stunned at the accomplishment. Second, it has a couple of the most exciting sequences in animation history, especially the climactic sequence in the door room. That's a scene that'll go down in the books. And, third, it's perhaps the first Disney film since Dumbo to be touching, but not cloying. Although some people have told me that the one song in TS2 made them cry, I personally was cringing through that number. There's a scene in Monsters Inc. that honestly made me cry. Generally, that's not much. I'm easily moved. However, I don't fail to notice if a film is emotionally manipulative. That's not the case here. The only other Disney moment that really touched me that deeply is the ""Baby Mine"" song from Dumbo. I think that the only people who don't cry during that song are convicts on death row. I really loved the characters in Monsters Inc. The relationship that develops between Sully and Boo is truly touching. It's developed in a very natural way. And it certainly helps that Boo is easily the cutest kid in the universe, even if she's not real. There were a lot of ""aww""s in the theater, but they were coming from college students, not maddening parents trying to get their kids to pay attention. Oh! And did I mention that the film's villain is one of Disney's best? He's a chameleon-like monster named Raymond, voiced by Steve Buscemi. Sure, his motives aren't all that interesting, but I love the way he moves. It's amazing. And his face is so expressive, but not too expressive like the characters in, say, ahem, Shrek.",2002

8,"Every summer a film comes around that takes everyone by surprise.  Last year it was Scary Movie and I'm sure in 1977 it was a film like Star Wars and then in 1981 it was Raiders of the Lost Ark.  Now I am not saying that The Fast and the Furious is in the same class as Raiders and Star Wars, just that it surprised everyone on the same level.  F&F is short on plot and dialogue and even some of the acting is lame, but what it is oozes is testosterone.  It pumps your blood, increases your adrenaline and attacks you with fast cars, sexy women and that one invariable that I think it has going for it... Vin Diesel.  There is just something about the guy, something that you really can't put your finger on, but he just has it. Maybe it is charisma, maybe it is charm, maybe it is just that he resembles some of the action heroes from the 80's with his chiseled triceps and his slabs of pecs.  Maybe it is all those things and maybe it is none of those things, all I know is that F&F is exactly what I had hoped it would be and nothing more.  This is the summer movie that I have been waiting for.  It's not that the films that have been out so far aren't that great because some of them are, it's just that this is the one that epitomises what summer as a teen ager is all about.  It is no wonder that exit polls for this film were around 65-70% under the age of 21.  And maybe that is why I enjoyed it so much.  I am pushing 30 but isn't it cool to lose yourself in a film that reminds you what it was like to be in highschool.  And isn't it cool to watch street racers break 140 miles an hour wile they shoot NOS through their vehicles?  Well isn't it?",2001
8,"Today I saw Tokyo drift and yesterday I saw 2 fast 2 furious for the fifth time, but I still find myself drawn toward the original. It stars Paul Walker as an undercover cop who infiltrates the street racing underworld of LA to catch a crook who has been hijacking millions of dollars worth of electronics from 18wheelers, causing the truckers to take matters into their own hands, ultimately ending in deaths and multitudes of money stolen. Now, you would think that because of the semi weak plot, this movie wouldn't be that good, however, the main storyline is just a small part of this movie, the other elements being action and some interesting relationships regarding vin diesels character. Diesel plays a street racing god, one of the best in the LA scene. Walkers character, Brians, way into the world is through Dominic Toretto (Diesel). Toretto has an air about him which draws other in, and Brian is no different. Throughout the movie, Brian is getting to know Dom, earning his trust, etc, but at the end of the movie, both Dom and Brian are forced to make a decision about each other... The whole relationship is interesting to watch. As for the action, there is plenty of it. Besides the many races, there is also some gunplay and some hand to hand fighting, and some interesting hijacking sequences.",2006

The Team stole $1.2 million worth of major electronics and the cops doesn't have any leads who has done it.

This movie I believe was very successful not only because during that point during the American culture Auto Tunning was reaching its peak but because of the actors selected. At that time these were not world wide icons and had not been involve in a blockbuster movie that would tattooed their careers in Hollywood. Finally I just want to point out that I am no movie critic or someone who studied in order to criticize a movie, I am simply an average Joe that likes to see all kinds of movies but, specially action movies been The Fast and the Furious my favorite movie of all times.

I became much more interesting in cars(specially tuning them) after watching ''The Fast and the Furious''and a whole new world have become a reality to me.

The acting is great as well, as usual Vin Diesel gives a brilliant performance, as Dominic Toretto. It has already earned a massive following, and when you leave the theaters you will be filed with such a massive adrenaline rush, that you and all your buddies will be left with the feeling that you must go out and race. Everybody I have talked to have said the same thing, it just has this crazy adrenaline rush it gives you.

All of this is what I love most about this film but I also love the cast; Vin Diesal, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster all clinch their roles. If I were to pick my favorite cast member I would have to go with Michelle Rodriguez because not only is she a talented actress she is beautiful and bad ass in everything she's ever been in and this is probably my favorite role of hers. This is a movie were you really don't have to care about the plot because all the eye-candy and fun of this movie is the cars, girls, and action which is enough to pull you into the driver's seat.

If you're into action and drama, then you'll love this movie. The racing scenes are very cool, and the in-your-face action keeps you on the edge of your seat. It entertained me throughout the whole thing, and I'd have to say the acting is a lot better than said by others to be.. The only one lacking to me, was Paul Walker, and, well, we've always known he wasn't much of an actor.. just a pretty face. However, the rest of the cast did an awesome job. I highly recommend this movie.",2012
10,"Firstly, this movie became a masterpiece and a blockbuster of all times - not because of it's plot, literally it is plain, but because of the scenes with the fast, tuned, hot cars, having neon lights and nitrous which was something people had never seen before. There had been many racing movies but this one is unique itself because of the illegal racing stuff. In my opinion this movie is very underrated because of it's low ratings and disliking reviews complaining about plot, but - come on, guys this ain't a movie whose purpose is to having a nice plot. If you want a nice plot movie go watch Star Wars but the purpose of the F&F franchise is to see some fast beautiful cars, hot chicks and affairs which are not about love but something more... I admit that the writing was not well-made but the defense of this disadvantage is that action films don't need perfect writing - go watch a good drama instead if you want a good writing.",2011
10,"I can not believe that this movie has only a 6.1 on IMDb.com. this movie is definitely way better than that. although i agree with IMDb.com that the 5th one is the best. this movie has the 2 things that i love. cars, and especially movies. this movie has a cliffhanger and is continued in part 2. this movie is about a cop who is undercover and befriends Dominic torreto who has a history with the cops. a fun movie for car lovers.",2011
10,"Outstanding movie, makes me want to go out and sup up my car and race somebody.  A definate see.  I loved the fast cars, the high speed adrenalin, and some good lookin women. One of the best ""car"" movies i've seen yet.",2001
10,"The Fast and the Furious comes at you like it says.  It's not a long movie and really never slows down much at all!  Those looking for a movie delving into a complex plot with in depth charachters need not watch it.  The movie is as the preview shows, a lot of great car chase scenes held together by a loose form of a plot.  It does what Gone in 60 Seconds only wishes it could do.  In gone in 60 you have 2 scenes with cars driving fast at all.  Here you have at least 6 or 7 distinctly different and memorable scenes. Although acting ability and some of the lines lack severely, this can be forgiven and is made up by the cars. This movie is perfect for anyone into speed and tuned import sports cars for the most part(yes, even the occasional despicable economy car made to ""perform"" is present)I saw the previews knowing this was going to be basically an adrenaline rush of a movie, and I gave it a 10 because that's what it delivered.",2001
10,"I just saw it for the thousand time, and it's still as good as the first time I saw it. Rob Cohen is a pure genius, he truly is. These movies are magnificently awesome and I'm going to tell you why. No Spoiler alerts I promise.",2013

10,This show is THE funniest damn show ever produced in Canada.  What a bunch of dumbasses these characters are!  You must see this show.  It is the funniest thing.  Just a bunch of small town folks living in a trailer park trying to make it.  Truly amazing!,2003
10,"Completely original, brilliantly written, beautifully acted, perpetually shocking and always quotable, TPB is simply one of the top 5 shows of all time. How many shows have had so, so many memorable, hilarious lines? Only the Simpsons, Larry Sanders, Sopranos quickly come to mind. The subject matter is refreshing and daring, it certainly could never escape heavy censorship in the US. Every line is funny, the dialogue is almost ""clockwork orange"" like. All the characters are excellent, the ensemble works so well together, I love seeing all of them, with their various looks changing season to season. Ricky may the best character overall, but they all have essential roles they have all mastered. I will admit that seasons 4 and 5 are slipping just the slightest bit from the dizzying heights of season 3, but it is still better than 99% of anything else. The Christmas Special ""Prequel"" from a couple of years ago was pure gold. It answered many questions, especially about Randy, and was brilliant. We finally got to see some winter scenes. Hopefully the movie will have some scenes in winter. The Alex Lifeson episode from season 3 should be in the TV Hall of Fame as one of the greatest 23 minutes ever shown. Thank you Canada!!! I am trying to spread the word down here in California.",2007

8,"With all the crap on American T.V. today, you would think that a show such as The Trailer Park Boys would somehow make it over here. It is a shame to think that there are millions of people in this country who don't even know who Ricky, Julian and Bubbles are. I found this show by accident on Netflix, and my wife and I have spent countless hours laughing hysterically at these crazy people from Canada. My all time favorite one is when Ricky tries to ""go straight"" as a shopping mall security guard. Anyone who has seen that one knows what I'm talking about.",2007
9,"The definition of Canadian comedy with a strong sense of a reality mockumentary. At first you may laugh at the show's odd characters, semi skilled acting, and the amount of swearing and outrages endings. The main group is Ricky, Julian, and Bubbles, all putting their own twist on the trio. Set in a trailer park the group simply solves their financial problems through robberies, cultivation, guns and scams everyone more extreme then the next. The group has there highs and their very lows, living in the shitmobile and constantly fighting the trailer park supervisor. I love this show and cant get enough of it, everyone should give it a try and watch the emotional roller-coaster of The Trailer Park BOys.",2006
10,"Now, for a comment from a yank. This is THE funniest, THE biggest-hearted show I've ever had the good fortune to stumble across! On behalf of all of us poor, misbegotten souls that live due south of you Canadian's lower border (a.k.a the tree line) (sorry, I just couldn't resist), thank you, thank you, thank you! TPB isn't distributed in the U.S. as far as I can tell, so if you're a yank and unless you happen to live near the border and can watch CBC you won't know about this show other than by freak accident (it was a Netflix experiment for me). I see from the last couple of pages that there really are a few trifling slobs (on both sides of the Canadian/U.S. DMZ) that just don't get it. Well , I'm truly sorry for those poor miserable souls, probably something to do with the amount of fiber in their diet, but down here in Alabama WE sure get it! I've made it a (minor) mission to spread TPB around to everyone I can find with a pulse and I have yet to find anyone who (after a few episodes) hasn't been won over heart and soul (I make my friends send off for the DVD's after the first I give them, kind of like the neighborhood pusher). I won't say they don't exist in 'Bama (a land that may not have invented trailer parks, but has certainly perfected them) just that they're rare. Maybe that's why I like this part of the planet so much. I'm sorry for those who just don't get it, but I'm hard pressed to understand them either. After all, anyone who has ever had a family should recognize Ricky, Julian, Bubbles, et. al., with all their schemes, their plots, all their massively dysfunctional and f***ed up ways (to quote Ricky), and all their grace and generosity (where it REALLY matters) immediately. I know I certainly do, those guys are everyone I'm related to and everyone I ever grew up with boiled down and condensed. Apparently a lot of others do as well, which says many good things about the human race (even that part of it living in the desert south of you Canadian's border). This is a magnificent show, it makes me laugh so hard I have to pace myself so I won't end up at the doctor's office. I'm waiting on pins and needles for the movie (which should be out this month according to the net) and for the next season, and I really do mean pins and needles, what in the world will Ricky do next?! If you've somehow managed to read this far along in the comments and haven't seen TPB, do yourself a favor and get it! If you still don't like it eat a bran muffin or something, you're obviously in need it.",2006
10,I never heard of these guys or the show. I seen this and had to get it. I like stupid and sick humor.,2007
10,"My roommate found the season 1&2 DVD in a bin for $5 somewhere, and since then we have all been hooked. Totally random but fortunate find. This show is brilliant - the characters are all so perfect. No one ever does anything out of character - everything Ricky does, even the dumbest thing most people could never conceive of doing, makes perfect sense for him. Mr. Lahey is always drunk though sometimes you can just barely tell. Seeing why Randy calls Mr. Lahey ""Mr. Lahey"" all the time in the Christmas special was perfect. And Bubbles - the smartest, most with it character in the park is also the guy who has almost made me cry from laughing too hard and from listening to his sad life stories. He just loves those kitties. A truly hilarious show.",2006
10,"At first, it seems like the trailer park boys is a typical cult comedy you should watch if you want to watch something while high, but as the show keeps going you realize that this show is a masterpiece of classical comedy. Made to satirize the everyday life of the lowest of the classes and the problems that run with them, manages to make you laugh, tell the truth and promote human feelings in the most genuine way. Take a look at every character at the show and you realize just how funny everyday life really is. Jules, the responsible guy who never lets his glass of liquor off his hand, Bubbles, the benevolent little cat guy that everyone loves, and lives by fixing stolen carts and Ricky, the full-mouthed little a-hole friend that everyone has, never stops smoking even with nicotine patches on him.",2014
9,This is my first review on this site.,2014

7,"When I first saw this show, I just zapped through the channels. The episode was probably half-way through, and first I thought it was a sort of documentary. My first impression was that it is horrible with these ""reality"" programs, just trying to obtain viewers by presenting ordinary people as idiots. The ""sheriff"" (can't remember his name) appearance, was the only reason I realized it was just a comedy. Brilliant entertainment. The atmosphere makes it very realistic and credible. Thankfully it is still being shown on Danish national television, I sure hope it continues. I have not seen many Canadian shows, but if this is the standard - bring them on!",2006
9,"I got the first two seasons on DVD as a gift just recently...I had sadly never heard of the show before that. That being said, I sat down and started watching and I ended up watching the first two seasons right in a row practically without stopping....that's how good it is. A lot of the comedy is subtle, background stuff that continues to surface even after multiple viewings. This show is definitely geared towards people with a slightly twisted sense of humor that don't require a laugh track or a punch line to clue them into the humor. All hilarity aside, this crew does a good job in getting you to believe in the characters and to generally want to know what happens with them -- even when you know most of what they WILL do will make you cringe one way or another. Now I have to see about getting other seasons on DVD...",2006
10,"Watched the first episode and wasn't really impressed. My son-in-law talked me into giving the show another try. Some of the best comedy, EVER, from any country.

10,"I have seen Moulin Rouge at least 25 times.  I think it is the most extraordinary movie of my generation and breaks every limit set by the industry.  I have heard all the traditional complaints...people didn't like the music, the editing was too swift, or it wasn't ""their taste"".  Moulin Rouge took a risk.  A risk films like A Beautiful Mind and Shakespeare in Love don't.  It risked by being controversial.  To make a likeable movie isn't hard, follow the Hollywood mold and stick in a few attractive actors, some bland dialogue and viola you have a film.  Moulin Rouge was made knowing that not everyone would like it, but knowing everyone would at least appreciate it for its artistic ingenuity.  Visually it is superb, an indulgent feast for the eyes with every breathtaking, artistic scene. Everything about it is over the top, every scene more stunning than the next, and as it continues your heart becomes more and more intertwined in the love story.  The editing in the Roxanne scene rushes through your body and is the most incredible of any movie in history.  Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGreggor are the most passionate on-screen couple; entirely convincing as their voices meld them together into one.  Never has a movie done what Moulin Rouge did.  It realized that the world of film is only being represented in one small way, whereas Moulin Rouge uses a camera and screen to make something bigger and more extraordinary than has ever been made before.  It pushes against the confines of convention and leaves you breathless.",2003
10,"I have not ever felt for a movie the way I do about ""Moulin Rouge.""  It is not just a movie...it is a cinematic experience the likes of which I have never before seen. The story, the music, the acting, the visual imagery strikes emotion in me I never before thought possible from a film. It is without a doubt the most brilliant piece of cinematic art I have ever seen. It is dizzy, maddening, beautiful, and heartbreaking!  The music is rapturous, and Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman's voices compliment each other and the story perfectly.  This movie takes its story to a mythic level and surrounds these two star-crossed lovers with music and imagery that simply will take your breath away.  The story is grand, huge, and operatic, as is the music. The brilliant score skillfully weaves many modern, popular songs, and rescores them as the libretto to this grand opera. There are some images in this film unlike anything you have ever seen. And the performances are absolutely incredible, particularly Nicole Kidman's.  I truly felt for these two people, and truly felt that they were in love.  My heart broke into a million pieces for them every time I saw this movie, and I've seen it 8 times. It's an absolutely breathtaking, visionary, masterpiece that did not get the credit it deserved by American critics, who seem to complain that every movie is the same. Yet when an original, daring, shocking film like this comes along, they don't know what to do with it. But then again, this really is not just a film. No mere film could strike me the way this one has, in a way that reaches to the very fibres of my being in a way only ""The Wizard of Oz"" ever has before. Yes, the story is sad, but what  a journey it takes you on! A journey I will be sure to repeat over and over and over again.",2001
10,MOULIN ROUGE! / (2001) **** (out of four),2001
10,"This was easily one of the best movies I've seen in years. Rarely do movies have a visual force capable of stunning you into rapt silence; and even more rare are films able to further this with a soundtrack that can move you and ensnare you as well, if not better, than the images. Yet some how, through genius, magic, luck, or some combination, Moulin Rouge has managed to do both. In truth Moulin Rouge is a fusion of two fabulous films into one. A film of images capable of conveying meaning without dialog or music, and a film which you could feel and understand with out needing to see it. Much effort was obviously spent on both the visual and audio aspects of this film, and by choosing not to focus on one over the other, and sacrifice the songs for the story or vice versa, the filmmakers were able to make a truly unique, modern musical which those of us who have hated musical since childhood could enjoy. Moulin Rouge is a blend of old, established techniques with innovative experimental ones, resulting in a movie which could only have been made in our time, yet which has a classic feel. The acting is wonderful, the mixture of modern songs is ingenious, and the cinematography is at times simply amazing. The end result is a stunning film with unbelievable performances; a cinematic experience that people will be loving, analyzing and trying to imitate for year.",2001
10,"I have now seen Moulin Rouge more times than I should say and I have noticed something new and unique every time.  This film is so intricate (and beautiful) that you cannot possibly absorb it all in one  viewing.  Luhrman (along with his Bazmark production team) really is a visionary and his films push the limits in such amazing ways.  The music, the sets, the choreography - all of it is awe-inspiring.  Ewan McGregor proves his versatility as an actor yet again by bringing such a heartfelt innocence to Christian - and  the man can sing!  Nicole Kidman went from being just another actress to me to one of my favorites - she takes on the role of Satine so honestly and proves that she not only has a comedic side but a great voice as well.  Together the two of them light up the screen.  In a year of mostly mediocre films (with a few notable exceptions) Moulin Rouge is totally refreshing.  It not only promotes truth, beauty, freedom, and love but is a perfect example of them as well.  Luhrman himself said that it was time for a new kind of storytelling and he was right!  Open your mind and enjoy one of the most original movie experiences in years.  A bohemian storm is brewing!",2001
1,"I just saw MOULIN ROUGE! the other night on Netflix and I thought it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Completely self-indulgent, contrived, soulless, and pretentious. And yet people keep calling it one of the greatest movie musicals ever. It's literally all style and no substance.",2011
9,"This is a story about life.  And about the artists who congregated in Paris in 1900, living a bohemian lifestyle and giving the world the fruits of their labor, of their art, for which they would gladly bleed and die.  But mostly this is a story about love.  Of a young man named Christian, a penniless writer, and a singer named Satine, who for a moment came together and tasted the nectar of the gods.  `Moulin Rouge,' written and directed by Baz Luhrmann, takes you into a world that is bright and brilliant, fast and flashy and filled with all of the things that make life worth living.  It's a fantasy world of song and color, of soaring hearts and aspirations-- but also of the reality upon which the illusion of it all is built.  And the effects of that reality on Christian and Satine, whose love has been forbidden by that same reality they seek to dispel by impaling it with the artistic endeavors that give them life.",2001
1,"This film was visually stunning and was shot in a unique style. Unfortunately this isn't a painting and a film can't be given a A just for how it looks on the outside.  Just like the new Planet of the Apes, this film was nice to look at but I just wanted to hit the mute button so many times during my viewing.  Truly a ghastly film and if it wins best picture over...well anything it would be time to do some national soul searching concerning what kinds of crap we're giving anyone with the first name Baz to make films.",2002
10,"The bad commercial campaigns of the best movie of all time failed to give Moulin Rouge! worldwide recognition, but alas, this happens with many great movies (e.g. Requiem For A Dream, Donnie Darko). The whole comparison between this and the new musical blockbuster Chicago is useless since they are both great movies but not the same. Still, Moulin Rouge! remains in the first place on the Best Movies list. This musical, comical, dramatical and action packed hell of a movie will satisfy the whole audience. It just needs to be given a chance. Never have I seen an audience stand up and clap, with tears in their eyes, at the magnificent movie they have watched.",2003
1,"This was one of the strangest films I have ever seen. For one thing, it seems like a weird role for Nicole Kidman to take, not her kind of thing at all. The movie was like a bad acid trip: too many sounds, too many blinding bright colors, and too much camera movement, all assaulting the senses simultaneously. The musical style was from the wrong era for the historical time of the film: too modern for it, so it clashed. It reminded me of the country music I frequently hear at the Chinese buffets in my city. Combine that with a lack of plot, and you have a hideous caricature that attempts to imitate a movie and fails. Very bizarre.",2011
1,"I have read so many posts on this message board concerning the adoration and delight people have expressed for ""MOULIN ROUGE"", for both its usage of creativity and for its stars, Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor. I skipped seeing this film when it was playing at the movies but my curiosity was spiked by the time it hit the video rental shelves at my local video store.",2002
1,Absolute trash. No originality. A pure cynical exercise by Hollywood to make as much money as possible with gross manipulations & boring visual effects & a non-existent script & third rate songs which are 80-100 years before their time.

1,"Can you say ""technicolor vomit?""  The idea for this film actually has a lot of potential:  Take a mish-mash of modern pop songs and blend them together in a creative way to create a romantic musical.  But what do we get here? An annoying nightmare of sound and sight that almost drove me from the theater.  This film is more chopped up than the vegetables in a Beni Hanna stir fry.  Luhrmann never focuses on one scene for more than a few seconds and when he does, the computer enhanced colors make the screen incredibly difficult to look at.  The music has moments of creativity, as when ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" is blended together with ""Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend"", but all of the scenes come across as little more than videos, not pieces creating a coherent whole.  With respect to the choice of songs: Gosh, can you get more random, Boz Luhrmann?  I mean, I actually feel like Luhrman put a couple hundred song titles in a hat and just chose them at random.  Very strange.  And I enjoyed Ewen McGregor's singing for about an hour (I found myself singing ""Your Song"" with him at the beginning of the film), but then it started to get annoying.  And Nicole Kidman...what can one say except, ""Yuck.""  Ever since I saw her in that Battman movie, she just bugs, bugs, bugs.  And I was listening to a PJ Harvey tape in my car on the way home from the theater thinking that Harvey would have been a great choice for the part of Seline.  But she probably wouldn't have been interested in such an artless film.  Finally, why o why does every big budget movie that is set in France have people speaking with British accents?  Is this some kind of unconscious Hollywood rule?  Or couldn't Luhrmann find anyone with French accents to play in this film?  Man, the French must have torn this thing up at Cannes.  ""I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that put down in words how terrible this film is while it's in this world.""",2001
1,"When will people figure out that you can't compensate for a lack of TALENT with glitz and glamour. Shaking the camera, inserting quick cuts and using over-the-top sets and costumes may distract some people from this atrocity, but some of us are insightful enough to recognize crap when we see it.",2003
1,"In a way, Moulin Rouge typifies everything that's wrong with American cinema by bastardizing everything that's right with its European counterpart. Visually, the movie is a great reference for any commercial or video director. But unlike a music video that lasts only three minutes, Moulin Rouge begins with a visual volume worthy of Spinal Tap and tries to sustain it for 120 minutes. It doesn't work. The rule of dynamics applies as much to a pretentious musical as it does to an ambitious action film. If the volume is too loud, you simply can't hear anything. Everything gets lost in Moulin Rouge's hurricane of desperate art direction and production design. The film's leads, talented actors though they may be, simply aren't charismatic enough to compete. The movie requires posturing, not acting. And, frankly, there are no less charismatic actors than Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman. In fact, their appeal is in their pastiness, not in their screen presence. What's more, the music can't compete either. Great songs are dwarfed by the never-ending onslaught of CGI visuals, which, after a while, become tedious. We get it, already. The moral of this story is that you still need one to make a good movie. Nothing can replace pen and paper. Unglamorous though it may be, a good script is everything. The filmmaker's previous effort with Romeo And Juliet worked precisely because he had a great script to begin with. The production design was icing on the cake. With Moulin Rouge, icing is all there is, and a satisfying meal it does not make.",2002
1,"Gag me with a giant MTV spoon! This was like watching MTV for 3 hours without a break. If you like that sort of thing then go see this movie. If however you like movies to have an interesting plot, authentic acting, characters you can care about and a camera that stays still for a few seconds at least, then save your money. Nicole looks good but the sex-appeal is just not there. The music is silly. I felt sorry for the actors. The supporting cast is forced to do the worst acting of their lives. The whole thing is just an expensive failure in film making.",2001
1,"When I first saw the movie, I gave up after 10 minutes, walked out of the theatre and kicked myself that I just have wasted 8$ on it. I just could not connect the use of modern songs with a historic setting. Convincing myself that I might just have had a bad day, and telling myself to have an open mind, I watched the DVD all the way through. Good grief, what a drag, and was I happy that I have just borrowed it from friends! A poor excuse for a plot, no character development at all, recycled (or, dare I say, massacred) pop songs, recycled ideas (La Boheme, La Traviata, Orpheus in the underworld), and, on top of that, dialogues which are mostly made up of strings of song titles, or repetitions of the key lines of the songs that have just been performed, the rest being commonplace statements. The only amazing thing is the art direction ,scoring a well deserved Oscar, but that's about it! Seemingly, Baz Luhrmann could not decide whether to make a movie (not enough plot) or an MTV video clip (too long, but still using the modern editing style of a video of light-speed camera moves and nano- second scene changes, which makes everyone older than 21 just nauseous!), and , most probably to keep the risk factor low, did not use even the tiniest bit of original ideas! Zip! Zero! Zilch! It has its funny moments, but they are too rare to make up for its shortfalls, such as lack of depth. The term love is used about 1000 times, however I could not connect to the characters (there is just not enough plot), and Satine's death left me stone cold. In short: a total waste of time.",2005

Marilyn Monroe sang ""diamonds are a girl's best friend"" much better; MGM made much better musicals in the '50's; Verdi and Puccini wrote operas that made you cry over the courtesan with a heart of gold dying of TB who finally meets her true love; and Monmartre at the turn of the century was probably a lot more interesting than this glitzy mess.",2002
1,"I was so incredibly disappointed.  This was truly a waste of both my time and money, and an insult to the glorious movie musicals of the past.  Not one original song--instead a long strain of every recycled old pop song you never want to hear again.  And the vocalists certainly did not help the matter.  Ewan McGregor, usually an excellent actor, suddenly loses all acting skills as soon as he opens his mouth to sing.  (As to his vocal abilities, he certainly leaves much to be desired.)  Kidman, though making a slightly better showing, was uninteresting and lacking in true vocal training, proving that it takes more than ""star power"" to have a vocal prowess that can carry a musical.  Definitely not Kidman's best work.  The story itself has potential, and the cinematography is unique and artistic...but the movie goes downhill from there.  This is a devastating mess of a movie.  If you're going to make a musical, for goodness sakes, PLEASE actually write an original musical score, and cast REAL SINGERS, not just ""big names.""

9,"I know I'm late as hell and I hate to break the overall 'vibe' about this movie but this movie was great when I saw it in the theater and gets better every time I watch it over again. And this is mainly because of the performances by Denzel and Ethan. I don't know what you guys expected but the movie CLEARLY suggests that Denzel is a crooked, burnt-out, streetwise cop and Ethan is a 'wet-behind-the-ears' clueless rookie. So knowing that, WHAT DID YOU GUYS EXPECT, Malcolm X, Remember The Titans, The Hurricane?? If you were, then maybe you all need to be checked out. The reason why this movie was so great is because it wasn't the typical Denzel 'role model' movie. We KNOW that he can play those roles well so it's a testament to his acting ability that he can portray the other side of the spectrum. And my hat goes off to Ethan because he bounces off Denzel flawlessly.",2006
9,"Before seeing this movie, my impression of Denzil Washington as an actor wasn't especially high. Not to say that he isn't talented, just that ever since Crimson Tide he appeared to be slotted neatly into every stern hero in every serious political thriller to be trotted off the studio assembly line for years. But then came Training Day and his role as Alonzo Harris and all that changed. Shrugging off the overly serious good guy image once and for all, Washington here is a revelation; a barking, ranting maelstrom of police brutality who believes that maintaining order on the crime ridden streets of LA means being even more ruthless than the drug dealers he faces on a day to day basis. His performance elevates the film from standard thriller fare into an exemplary story that has quite rightly become one of my favourite films of all time.",2006
8,"Training Day is a solid action crime thriller with exceptional performances by Ethan Hawke and especially Denzel Washington. Director Antoine Fuqua has done an admirable job of making this movie about a rookie cop who gets into a lot more than he bargained for while on a day with a senior rogue detective to prove he's got what it takes to be a narc. Denzel Washington is fantastic as twisted but charismatic Detective Alonzo Harris who takes a big departure from his good guy roles to play the villain in this one. Washington has show over and over again that he's a talented actor. Well he continues to prove just that in Traning Day and then some. Ethan Hawke is equally impressive as rookie cop Jake Hoyt who finds himself in one increasingly dangerous situation after another. Hawke holds his own against Washington on screen and he may not have the flashier role but he goes a very good job as the hero in this film. The rest of the supporting cast including Scott Glenn, Cliff Curtis, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and a brief appearance by Tom Berenger are solid in their roles but none of them are given much to do and are merely given extended cameos. They still prove to be effective none the less in their brief screen time. The music seemed to sync very well with what was happening on the screen and the tone of the film. The brutal action violence is well executed but the showdown between Washington and Hawke near the end did get a bit unrealistic. It was still intense though and the two actors really got to show their off their acting chops in this movie. The vulgar language did get a bit much at times but the good more than outweighs the bad in this one. Despite some flaws Training Day is an entertaining action crime thriller with great performances from Hawke and especially Washington who make this movie definitely worth the time to watch.",2009
10,"""Training Day"" was a very good movie. I like movies that shove it in your face and make you deal with it...movies like, ""Black Hawk Down""...no clichés, no touching moments, just brutal, bitter realism. ""Training Day"" was such a movie. However, the one thing that made this film really shine was the performance by Mr. Washington. To me, a good actor is someone who just IS a character...if it isn't obvious that they are acting than they are doing a good job. That was the case with Washingon. He just was Alonzo. Every pantomime, every word, every glance was performed masterfully. Did Mr. Washington deserve his Oscar? Absolutely. 200%. Some people say, ""not Oscar material"" and I must wonder, what film...what performance were they watching?",2006

10,"In his Acadamy Award Winning Performance,as best Actor.The movie, as the title suggests, follows a single day in the life of rookie cop Jake Hoyt (Hawk) as he is subject to a single day of evaluation by a senior, decorated police narcotics officer Alonzo Harris (Washington) to see if he has what it takes to be a 'narc'. Almost immediately Hoyt is placed on the back foot, constantly caught off guard by Alonzo's nature, his ability to switch between a cold, no-nonsense street-wise player, a genuinely caring and good intentioned leader, and occasionally jovial companion. From their first encounters though, where Hoyt tells Harris he will do ""anything you want me to do"", the situations Hoyt is taken into become more and more morally ambiguous, from the simple use of excessive force to outright illegal activity, forcing Hoyt to decide which side Harris is truly on, whether to trust him, or whether Hoyt is the unwitting centerpiece of a huge and complex web of lies and set-ups in order for Harris to for fill his own sinister motives..This is the movie that won Denzel the Oscar that year for Best Actor!! A must watch",2006
9,"If you ask me, TRAINING DAY is an excellent film that is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat and blow you away. Harris (Denzel Washington) kind of gave me the creeps. You'll understand why once you've seen this movie. In my opinion, the performances were top grade, the direction was superior, the costumes were perfectly designed, and the cast was perfectly chosen. Also, the soundtrack is really good, too. Before I wrap this up, I must warn you that this movie is very violent if you're going to see it, so viewer discretion is strongly advised. Now, in conclusion, if you're a fan of Denzel Washington or Ethan Hawke, I highly recommend this movie. It's sure to keep you guessing from start to finish.",2006

9,"I remember being lent this on DVD during the summer holidays by a mate soon after it was out. I must have watched it every day/second day for about a month! I loved it so much I could never get enough. Denzel and Ethan are a perfect match for this movie; I can't imagine anyone else playing their rolls. Can you? You will either love this movie or find it just a way to 'pass a night'. If you connect with it then you'll never forget it. I know I haven't and I haven't watched it since 2002 because I can remember every part in detail! Training Day is one of those movies which breaks new ground in terms of how a movie can come across to people. It was filmed in such locations such as Imperial Courts neighborhood which, until now, hasn't been filmed. The talk is the talk... you get a real sense of what it's like for these guys as narcotic officers and for what it's like for these guys as the 'bad guys' themselves. At the end of they day they're ""Just people and they always were"" (Ethan Hawk in a making of Traning day interview).",2006
9,"This movie's a top quality police drama that's not only violent, tense and exciting but also authentic, intelligent and utterly engrossing. It's set in the most dangerous neighbourhoods of L.A. where undercover cops regularly have contact with drug dealers and gangsters and also face high-risk situations on an almost daily basis. The men who undertake this work have to assume many of the characteristics of the criminals they pursue in order to be accepted and in so doing are expected to avoid being sucked into behaving in the same way as the people they're seeking to bring to justice. Needless to say, not every officer manages to do this.",2012
9,"Denzel is a real chameleon. This is a sinister and likable personality...all because of him. Enter Ethan Hawke's character, officer Jake Hoyt. With the allure of a new job, a transfer to the division that he has been working hard to reach. He is at the top of his game. ",2007
10,"Awesome, one of the best films ever and Denzel Washington does a very convincing portrayal of the cop who crosses the line, but you have to agree with some of his motives. I love when he shoots Roger and Jake freaks out, he makes a very good point when Jake asks why he shot a friend. ""Why was he my friend, because he knew my first name? Roger sold crack to kids and the world is a better place with him dead!"" Every point he makes about modern day ""street"" justice rings very true to modern day crime and justice. It sets the tone very well for an awesome films and all though he is ultimately the bad guy, Alonzo Harris is one of the best characters to every grace the big screen and you can't help but like the guy. There are some great cameos from Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg",2006

There are no clichés, nothing feels sappy, and it is a hard experience for the viewer at times to see the reality of the streets of L.A. and its corruption depicted in this movie.",2015

7,"With two very engaging actors taking lead roles, in the form of Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke, this movie seemed to promise a great deal. Yet somehow it never live up to its pretensions.",2009
4,"""Training Day"" is a third rate cop drama/thriller with an uninteresting plot and not one believable character. The movie couldn't be further removed from reality. If this was supposed to be a brainless action movie it wouldn't bother me that much, but since this flick has won an Oscar one can't be so forgiving.",2005
10,"First of all, once again I think the critics have got it wrong. Like Blade Runner and 2001, this is a film that will be properly judged in 10/20 years or maybe more. Its way ahead of its time, the combination of Kubrick and Spielberg is unique, its unlikely we will ever see anything like this again.",2001
8,"I won't say people will either love this movie or they will hate it. I'm sure it breaks down that way to some extent, and the range of opinions expressed about the movie support that notion, but I'm nevertheless also sure there are those out there who are ambivalent or indifferent about it, neither loving or hating it. That's because I'm one who was ambivalent about it after I first saw it in 2001. There was much to like about the movie. Film makers par excellence, Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg. Does it get any better than that? The cast was good too, all of it. Especially Haley Joel Osment. Production values galore. The film is beautifully rendered. But even with all that there was something about it that bothered me, even annoyed me, and whatever it was it got in the way of my enjoyment of it. So I dismissed this movie and didn't even think about again it for years. Recently it popped up on HBO. I took the opportunity to watch it again. I found myself not being as bothered by the movie as I was before. HBO being HBO, I watched it again. And then again. Now there is nothing about the movie I dislike or that bothers me. I now like this movie without reservation. I also figured out why I reacted the way I did in the initial viewing.",2009
10,"Steven Spielberg's latest movie A.I.: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, which he took up at the encouragement of the late, great Stanley Kubrick, has caused widely divergent comments.  And I can't help wondering if the most scathingly negative reviews of this movie aren't just an open desire to see Spielberg crash, as he had with ""1941"" and HOOK.",2001
9,AI - ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE / (2001) ***1/2 (out of four),2001
10,"This movie has SO many angles, so much information... I was completely blown away by it and will definitely go see it many more times in the cinema. This is one of the classic movies of all time and I was appalled by the complete lack of understanding by many of the other user-comments.",2001
9,"I loved this film. It isn't one of the greatest films ever made, but it's a personal favorite of mine. I cried at the two sad points, I laughed at the mannerisms of Gigalo Joe and Teddy, the super-toy, my heart pumped faster at the action, suspense, and horror, but overall, I really enjoyed the film on a whole. I didn't find an ounce of it boring at all. It's practically the same as observing an extraordinary life and extraordinary tale of a boy who just wants his mommy. But the boy is not a boy, and rather a robot. But the way he acts can pass for a human any day.",2001
10,"I thought A.I. was a very good film.  I'm sure it is somewhat different from what Kubrick had thought but he and Spielberg had worked on it for a long time. I liked the questions that it posed about such as what does it mean to be a being?  Does the boy robot have genuine feelings or are they programmed?  But we as people do we have genuine feelings or are they ""programmed"" in our genetic code, by society, and by other factors?  Intriguing questions from an intriguing film. Definitely a thinking persons movie. The acting by Haley Joel Osmet was outstanding and the supporting cast was equally good, too.  The portrayal of the future was somewhat frightening but also extremely fascinating. Especially the ending of the film.  I saw this film with my brother who's first word when the film ended was ""Wow!""  He only expresses that for films he really likes.  Those who like science fiction and those who like films that make them think definitely see this film.  Even if you are not as impressed as I am you will find parts of the film fascinating.",2001
10,"It is fitting that A.I., Steven Spielberg's monument on film to Stanley Kubrick, is a shoe-in for Best Picture in 2001. A.I. is cinematically beautiful, and tells a wrenching emotional story of a child's quest for maternal love.",2001
1,"If you haven't seen this movie, be grateful.  *spoilers ahead*",2001
10,"Wow!  That was all I could say when I walked out of the theatre after my first helping of A.I.  I wasn't sure whether I loved the movie or was disappointed by it, I just knew it had had a huge effect on me.  Having seen it a further three times at the cinema, I still find fault with it, but I keep returning to it, thinking about it, discussing it, and it has left me with a feeling that, five months later, I've still not shaked.  In many regards, this movie reminds me of Fight Club, not in terms of theme or emotional content, but due to it's level of craft, the daring nature of it's execution and the fact that I keep re-evaluating it.  All the things that are possible to comment objectively on (if anything ever is) are handled expertly.  The performances are top-notch, especially Haley Joel Osment as David, the little robot child that longs to be human.  The effects are not only very impressive, but are integrated into the story rather than calling attention to themselves.  Januz Kaminski's photography is, as one has come to expect, impressive, and the movie is unusually unpredictable for such a big-budget experience.",2002
5,"I would say that I was disappointed by this movie, except that I admittedly went in with relatively low expectations (based on reviews) and it wasn't THAT bad.  But the movie WAS a mess.  There is a great idea buried in here somewhere, and its an interesting topic with great dramatic potential.  But the movie only achieves emotional fusion in fits and starts, and it just sort of wanders on along rather than moving with force and purpose.  The ending, in particular, should have been much, much better, and felt tacked on, perhaps in service of the fairy tale narration.  In the end, this one felt like it needed two or three more passes beneath an editor's red pen to tighten it up, focus the plot, highlight the theme, etc.  I was very ready for it to be over, long before the final credits rolled.",2003
1,This movie is frustrating for so many reasons.,2007
10,"The ""literalists"" are clearly not happy with A.I. So now is a good time to recall that ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" was greeted upon release with derision, confusion, dismissive reviews, public consternation, and, oh yeah, some thought it was an absolute masterpiece. Beyond the monolithic influence of that film (think of Han Solo's jump to lightspeed, etc.), the symbols of ""2001"" -- TO THIS VERY DAY -- cannot be decoded using anything but the most personal, interpretive language. The obelisks, the message of the obelisks, the Star Child, Cosmonaut Dave's ""room"", HAL-9000's true motivation  all these things remain in our collective subconscious as indelible images that refuse to be concretely defined between or among viewers. WHAT CAUSES THIS CONFLICT OF PERCEPTION? IS IT INTENTIONAL? Again and again, Kubrick's films take us to a No-Man's Land of narrative and moral ambiguity, stranding us, forcing us to make decisions, demanding interpretation (or we can judge the surface, walk away, hate the film). To my perception, Kubrick is the only, true ""Brechtian"" film director. The device Brecht proposed is ""Alienation Effect"", or put simply, Leading the audience down two, divergent paths at once. My favorite example is ""Barry Lyndon"". Being the adventures of a young man, handsome, virtuous, well-meaning, ambitious, full of promise. Yet in every scene, the camera ""pulls-back"" revealing Barry (but never to himself) to be womanizing, self-absorbed, criminally inclined, socially inept, not very bright, morally bankrupt, and at last, a broken shell of a man. Or let's consider ""Strangelove"": Did Kubrick really create a headbanger, slapstick comedy about nuclear proliferation, mass destruction, and military/political incompetence? The real question is ""Who else could have?"" Well, that's my take on Kubrick's artistic sensibility, and, without daring to presume Spielberg's motivation, it's what drew them both to ""A.I."" Pinocchio, the Blue Fairy, cuddly Teddy Bears on one hand, but on the other hand  social institutions are faltering forever -- parenthood, childhood, science, industry, sexuality -- all distorted beyond repair. And Humans, the ultimate A.I. protagonist, seem blissed-out, in denial, more interested in creating ""Davids"", ""Darlenes"" and ""Gigolo Joes"" than in rising water levels and the imminent threat of extinction. Therefore, I believe A.I. is getting precisely the response all Kubrick films ""INITIALLY"" get. Spielberg's reputation and career can withstand anything that public perception might bring to his films, but I keep thinking that A.I. is the riskiest moment of his artistic life.",2001
1,(++++Spoilers) Can anybody answer these 4 questions about A.I. for me:   ,2002
1,"The last hour of this movie made me feel more uncomfortable in a movie theater, than I have ever been.  It was like Chinese water torture.  Not only did it have a bad ending, it had several bad endings.  Just when you thought it had ended, it would keep going with dumber conclusions.  I dont mean just once or twice.  There was about 5 or 6 tease endings.  As it continued it got worse.  I want my eight bucks back.",2002
3,"Strange, ""ET"" made me weep so did ""Close Encounters"" but I didn't weep in ""Schindler's List"", where the horrors depicted are devastating and the pain, unbearable. How can I explain that? It's not just me, discussing the subject with friends we were all in agreement, a situation more unique than rare, the only in disagreement was a friend from Aberdeen, she cried in ""Schindler's List"" from beginning to end, but she doesn't count, she also cried in ""Zoolander"". So the mystery persists. Steven Spielberg, the most commercially successful movie director of the last 30 years, has touched and ventured into different genres with the uttermost confidence. His most artistically, emotionally and financially successful movies are the ones that appeal to a child's imagination. The child in all of us. So, why is it that ""Artificial Intelligence"", with a child, and what a child, at the centre of the story, is so cold, so confused, so unsuccessful. I think, I suspect, I imagine that it has to do with intellect. Spielberg is an anti intellectual. When he feels we feel when he thinks we don't feel anything. The boy's need for his mother's love could have been the definitive Spielberg movie. Instead, is as if he was telling us the story against his will. The scene in which the mother has to abandon his robot son, could have been unforgettable, instead, a lot of acting in a Disney like little forest. That's also the end of the movie. It is followed by a second feature that should be called ""Mad Max meets Dr.Who"" with a splendid Jude Law. I went to see the film at the first matinée on its opening day. I left the theatre kind of depressed, not sad, depressed. I was reminded of it today because my friend from Aberdeen had rented the DVD, she was watching it and of course, she was crying.",2005
2,I'm a sci-fi fan and appreciate the hypothetical situation of what could happen if a robot is given feelings of love and attachment to a person or people. Some good actors made the best of it but I can only blame the directing and screenplay adaptation of the original story.,2007
1,"W.C. Fields is oft quoted as having said ""Anyone who hates children and dogs can't be all bad.""  In this film, Stanley Kubrick leaves dogs alone, but does a great job of trashing children, shades of his own unhappy childhood, perhaps?  If you have to watch this, and have the good fortune to do so on video, the 'fast forward' button can reduce the amount of gratuitous hatred and violence.  Trying to outdo ""Clockwork Orange,"" or reset it with children?  There were four parts in the first half that persuaded my wife to quit watching altogether, and myself to watch the second half almost entirely in fast forward: 1. The hatred of the 'real' Martin for the 'mecha' David 2. The 'Snow White' scene where the mother abandons David in the woods. 3. The subsequent meeting with the homeless 'mechas' 4. The subsequent cruelty and violence at the 'Flesh Fair.' There seem to be enough news stories of parents who hate their own children to the point of seriously injuring or killing them, and raw unshakable hatred in many parts of the world, paying to watch it for 'entertainment' was for us, pointless.  Perhaps if the four points above had not been immediately sequential, this film would have been less horrible.",2002
8,"I saw A.I. on the first night it ran here and I must say I was disappointed in the size of the audience. How strange to see so few people show up for a Spielberg film. This film did not enjoy the normal hype that most of Spielberg's films enjoy, I think I know why. Lack of product placement. They're may have been some somewhere but I didn't see them.  A.I.'s story line and flawless visual effects reflect what I can only describe as the meeting of two great film makers. Kubrick (who started work on the project after he read the Aldiss book in '83),and Steven Spielberg who's long list of intelligent blockbusters made him the perfect person to bring this story to the screen. I could, I believe see the story boards and concepts Kubrick developed and I could also see the sensitivity that Spielberg added to scenes and characters. These two things are not entirely separate in good Science Fiction. All good science fiction has some human sensitivity in it otherwise it would just be a horror film. The script reflects some of the darkness and coldness that sometimes underlies each character human and machine, there is no fear of this in the story. This darkness draws us on in the story.",2001
10,"To start off with, I heard a lot of good things about this movie when it was on the big screens but never got around to see it before it disappeared. Sitting here, long after in the aftermath, I might never forgive myself for missing that opportunity. Eventually I did get around to see it, though a small TV never does a film the same justice a theater does, and being a bit sceptic about the small hype this movie caused made me prejudice about it, but I must say I have never been so wrong before. And I am happy saying it.",2003

9,'Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain' finds its charm in the little things. The story about Amélie (Audrey Tautou) is a modern day fairy tale and that is exactly how it looks the entire film. ,2004
10,I had heard superlative comments on this film and it does not disappoint.,2002
10,"Amelie is a film that struck a certain chord with me. Every now and then movies come along that speak out to you and emotionally touch you in some way. Amelie is one such film for me. I related to its innocent charm and delightfully shy protagonist played by French sensation Audrey Tautou, the way very few films have. Part of the reason we watch movies is to learn something about ourselves or recognize characters that are remarkably similar to us and the way we are in real life. For all of us shy, introverted, quirky, and odd-ball eccentrics out there who have trouble relating to ""normal"" people, Audrey Tautou in this film is our personal hero. Instead of going into much detail about why the film works, I'll instead try to explain what it meant to me personally. Sure I guess this means I have to open up maybe more than I'd like to about myself, but oh well. The way Amelie's childhood was presented is similar to my own. I am an only child to divorced parents and very rarely had friends as I was and still am very much a loner. As a child much of my time was spent alone so I entertained myself in all kinds of silly ways. Just like Amelie does in the film. Of course I gained my fixation with films at an extremely early age, but also did stupid things like give my stuffed animals personalities and have conversations with them, draw pictures and create stories to go along with them, and laid in bed listening to the radio with the windows open on a lazy summer day imagining creatures out of the cloud formations. Apparently there are legions of us out there. Even today I enjoy solitude far more than the company of most people and still use my imagination to think of stupid little things. Amelie did an amazing job in capturing what the world is like through the eyes of a person who doesn't really fit in, but finds joy in the simple things in life. Like the fresh spring breeze on your face, the sound of the rain, the chirping of birds, the touch of fur, and popping bubble wrap. Actually popping bubble wrap was always an exciting and rare treat during my youth. Jean-Pierre Jeunet's film also has a marvelously fun nifty view of sex. For Amelie sex is not something that is intimidating, temptingly desirable, sinful, adult, or lustful. It's just another of the many silly things that people do in this world that make us human. Two people taking off their cloths and rubbing up against one another. How sweet! In fact many people have insulted the film for it's unique view and open attitude towards sex. For shame really. Sure there's a lot of it actually. Amelie's first sexual encounter, the orgasms, the object of her affection working in a porn shop with a stripper and putting price tags on didoes. But it's all in good fun and filmed with the naivety that a character like Amelie would view sex as. Anyways the movie really works. Cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel does an excellent job in filming Jeunet's crazy vision and Audrey Tautou with her funky hairdo, wide brown eyes, and whimsical voice and kitten like mannerisms and shyness brings the movie to life. As I said I relate to this movie and understand the character the way I do with few other movies simply because it is frighteningly very much like I tend to be in real life. ",2005
10,"Waiting for `Amelie' to begin in a theater fraught with noisy college students drinking cheap beer, I wasn't expecting anything more than an over-hyped flick from our friends in France.  I slowly began to realize as I watched Amelie skip stones in the canal that for the very first time, a film deserved all of hype it had been accorded and more, and I felt so blessed to be a part of this revelation.",2003
10,It is the best film i've ever seen.Only the French could make films as good as this. Amélie explores the trivial things in life and it brings you to some realisations of your own in that our lives are so simple and we only need the simplest of things to keep us happy. Amélie is a must for anyone,2003

1,"Two of my friends had told me how much they had enjoyed this movie, so it was a big surprise to find how much I disliked it. The main character, played by Audrey Tatou with the most off- putting mannerisms, was so artificially sweet and coy it made me want to puke. Almost the entire ridiculous story was riddled with self-conscious cuteness. I say 'almost' only because after forcing myself to watch it for almost an hour in the hope of some improvement I couldn't stand it anymore and switched it off.",2010
1,"Let's be honest: is this film really worthy of being in the Top 250? What with all the psychotic behavior and the annoying, creepy smiles Amélie cracks from time to time while she's trying to be cryptic and heroic, this film is easily one of the worst I've seen. The worst part is when people go on trying to defend it, saying that the character is simply misunderstood and that since the film is french, it offers a different perspective. Do we have to remind people that foreign films also have the ability to suck as much as American films? And I tried to give this movie a chance but the more I tried, the easier it was to find things that I didn't like about it. So go ahead, defend it as much as you like, but it doesn't change the fact that it's one of the most annoying films of the decade.",2011

Even her devious look on the cover shot I wonder, maybe she would have worked in a Bugs Bunny cartoon as the girlfriend of Wile E. Coyote. Not to be malicious just this movie was so odd. It seems so many people like this movie and for the life of me I cannot understand why. People I've read who like the movie there is a strange correlation to hash usage.

She's really cutesy and pale and she doesn't say anything. She's like a cross between Shirley Temple and a mime. By the end of the movie you just want to reach into the screen and choke her. Beyond that, as far as I can tell, the movie has no point whatsoever. And just for record, I'm not just saying this because I'm an idiot American who can't appreciate French cinema--I actually love French films (my favs are The Girl On The Bridge, La Haine, and Leon: The Professional). But this one just makes me want to pull my hair out. Anyway, I'll certainly attempt to watch it again at some point and give it another chance, but so far I'm at a complete loss as to why this movie is ranked at #18. Feel free to reply and tell me why I'm wrong.",2003
1,"I watched this movie because it was a rainy day and i had nothing else to do, but God this is an awful movie. there was nothing funny, exciting,romantic or moving about it. the only reason why people think this is because of the music(which really worked on my nerves). I had to think some time about why I hate this movie so hard before it became clear to me, but this is my conclusion: The character of Amelie is so freaky,(she's a total freak)that if she would have existed nobody would want to be associated with her. Probably she would have been bullied so much in her youth that she would have psychic problems and probably be in some kind of setting for mental people(sorry if my English isn't correct). And there is no normal person who would fall in love with her,like happens in the movie. if it was a spastic thin ugly guy who never washes himself it should have been a little bit credible, but otherwise this is completely wrong. Happy feeling? I felt miserable, and angry because I had lost so many time on this movie. everything Amelie did ennoyed me, and the reactions of the people ennoyed me even more, they should have reacted like: WTF go away are you sick in the head or what? Conclusion: if she would have died a terrible death with nobody who cared about her at the and of the movie, it would have cheered me up. the only positive thing about this film is that it is spoken in french, nothing more ennoying than French people talking English in Paris. Another thing: why does she look Chineze? the family Poulin is just a bunch of marginal people who have no friends. and the way they react they are just little children who will never be able to get a good job and earn money. and if Amelie wanted to try to step out of this marginality, and start acting normal, then it would be a good movie, now it sucked, because it is much to unrealistic. I can continue this for hours but I don't want to loose more time on this ""thing""(dont want to use the word movie)but I Will stop here.",2008
1,"After a snappy beginning, Amelie became unbearably boring.  The title character was the principal problem.  About two-thirds of the way through the movie, I lost all interest in what would happen to her. I wanted to scream out, ""Just say something.  Anything.""   The ending was ludicrously delayed.  What did everyone else see in this movie?",2002
6,"Amelie is the quirky main character, who seems to go on a binge of ""random acts of kindness"" except that they aren't so random, and some are kind of mean. It is reasonably enjoyable, and probably worth a rental. I cannot fathom its ranking, though. I think that films should maybe be a few years old before being eligible for the top films of all times lists, like the top 250. I looked through that list and there are some new films which will be utterly forgotten in 20 years. I fear that ""Amelie"" will be among them. Grade: C",2003
1,"This movie is extremely static. It is a character study hitched to a romance. What is seen visually is more often than not an illustration for the voice over narration. It is very close to a book-on-tape. The title character is atrocious. She hasn't enough strength of character to confront a loud-mouth unless it is from the back of a crowd. Don Diego de la Vega could have risen to the challenge without donning his Zorro suit. I don't know when unlawful entry becomes burglary. None of the petty crimes she commits are ennobling or endearing. Amelie is a sad case, which makes the love story rather frightening. The man becomes intrigued when he sees her quasi-pretty face and guesses that they might have something in common. That he gets her in the end turns the whole film into a",2001

8,"After two brief scenes that at first seem unrelated to the rest of the film, we see a dark-haired, obviously rich beauty in the back of a limousine. Her driver stops at an odd location on Mulholland Drive, which is a twisting, thickly wooded two-lane road full of mansions overlooking Los Angeles. Just as her driver and another man in the passenger seat turn around to kill her, two drag racing cars from the opposite direction come crashing into the limo. Only the dark-haired woman survives. She works her way down the ridge to Sunset Boulevard and hides in a vacationing woman's apartment. Shortly after, Betty (Naomi Watts), the vacationing woman's niece, shows up at the apartment and runs into the dark haired woman, who now has amnesia. The bulk of the first part of the film is Betty and the dark haired woman trying to figure out who she is, why people were trying to kill her and why she had thousands of dollars and a strange key in her purse. This is interspersed with oddly surreal threads about Hollywood producers and directors, with occasional forays into a land of hoodlums and prostitutes.",2005

10,"The case history of 'Mulholland Dr.' is known: What should had been another excursion (after 'Twin Peaks') into the rivaled field of TV-series ended up abruptly after completing the pilot. It was too risky and twisted for the producers to venture an investment. Lynch used all the filmed and cut material and started new shootings to finish a completely new feature film. The result: One of the most impressive cinema experiences of this decade which can be ranked among the best works of David Lynch. His earlier movies 'Eraserhead', 'Blue Velvet' or 'Wild at Heart' kept aloof in an irritating way which hustled the viewer into the role of a voyeur, but never involved him as part of the plot happening such as here.",2005
6,"Mulholland Drive ( David Lynch, 2001), one of the most ambiguous films to be unleashed upon contemporary audiences, dare one say ""abstract"" even. In an era where simplicity is preferred over mystery and intrigue, the average audience member may find such a film angering in all respects. It resembles the classic noir genre, in so much that the infamous street Sunset Boulevard even appears in the movie as an ominous homage to the Billy Wilder film of the same name. Like that 1950 film, this movie's themes and tone is dark, but nowhere near as formulaic, per say. Classic film noir still relied on a certain pattern of events and character niches; the femme fatale, the unsuspecting victim most often our male protagonist and of course the incorruptible detective figure. This narrative method follows the invisible style, making it generally easy to understand. Mulholland Drive breaks many of these rules without a second glance, clarity being at the very bottom of its intentions if at all. Director David Lynch sets this in motion in a number of ways.",2011

This movie is actually based on a straight-forward, symbolism-free story that tricks you with the idea it's a dream by adding mysterious characters doing things you can only guess how and why, but indepedently of their reasons you can clearly understand their intentions, and by adding multi-explainable plot twists that all in all lead to nowhere.",2002
8,"Lynch loves to realistically portray logical sequences interspersed by fantasy diversions, which entrances but confuses the viewer.

The movie really is all over the place and ends on an even more curious note.

10,"I rented the first season almost at random--I'd only barely heard of the show--and I'm so, so glad I did.  Within the first ten seconds Ricky Gervais had me quietly snickering; within twenty I was laughing out loud; eventually a few tears welled up and my stomach began to hurt.  And I didn't quit laughing until the show was over.  Gervais is possessed of the very rare talent of being funny on several different fronts, simultaneiously; he's like a comedic juggler: he's a teller of conspicuously (but not too conspicuously) bad, often tasteless, jokes; he's a backstabbing hypocrite of Tartuffian quality; and for those who have worked in offices and have had bad (or even mediocre) bosses, he is like a balm for the lost dignity office workers experience through petty politicking.  (So the show is rather cathartic.)  That little look Gervais gives the camera at times (which seems to state, ""You didn't see that, did you?"") is precious.  I have to be careful to not oversell this show, but right now I would say that, as a character, David Brent (Gervais) is right up there with Reginald Perrin and Basil Fawlty, and that is sacred territory in my book.  But while writer-actor Gervais is the brightest spot in the show, the other cast members, namely Tim Freeman, Mackenzie Cook (who some will recognize as the eye-popping pirate in PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN), and Lucy Davis, are great too.  This show, I predict, will go down as one of the great TV comedies, up there with with FAWLTY TOWERS and SEINFELD but perhaps just below MONTY PYTHON and SCTV (at their best).  A word of warning: if you don't like (i.e., don't understand) irony, this may not be the show for you; stick with Jim Carrey and Martin Lawrence.  (Nothing against those actors; THE OFFICE, though laugh-out-loud funny, seldom hits one over the head with its comedy.) I only hope the second season approaches the quality of the first.",2004

The show pushes the limits a little farther the the US version for sure and keeps a thrilling dryness throughout. The character development is captivating and you end up knowing them so well they become funnier and funnier. There's definitely not as many character developments as US Office but it almost helps because you become very connected to the couple that are. David Brent (Ricky Gervais) is possibly one of the the top 5 funniest personalities I've ever seen in a show. All of his insecurities and delusions are addicting and you can't wait to see what he does next. The love story throughout involving Dawn the receptionist is as sweet as it gets, building up to an epic final ending that will definitely give you chills. Loved the show, and I highly recommend it!",2013

Just simply Brilliant.",2006
10,"As an American and existing fan of the US version of The Office, I went into this series with low expectations. I was anticipating being disappointed with other actors playing in the roles I already loved so much. After viewing the first episode, I was not very impressed. The same exact script had been used for the first episode of the US version, so it was exactly what I was expecting from the show - a retro-rehash. However, I was curious as to whether or not the rest of the series used the same scripts, and that's literally the only reason I watched the second episode. I'm glad I did. I was drawn in enough to watch the third episode, and more so after the fourth. By the end of the first season, I absolutely loved the show. It's important to recognize that the US and UK versions of the show are different to the point where it makes no sense to compare them beyond the first episode. The US version has some brilliant characters and is a great show in its own right, but it is at heart an episodic comedy. The UK version is a tightly-knit drama with comedic elements, and both seasons of the show have very specific stories to tell. Where the US version is relatively stagnant in terms of ongoing stories, the UK version sticks closely to a narrative. The first season is about David's attempt to save his branch and the second is David's descent from a self-proclaimed clown to a pitiable but detestable worm. This overarching plot is intertwined with Tim's love story, and both come to tragic endings - Tim's for clear reasons, and David's for a more complicated one. While it's easy to be disgusted by David, it's also difficult to hate him entirely. The complexity of the character is the true triumph of the show, as none of the people we see on-screen are entirely likable - and yet we forgive them, just as we forgive the people we care about in our real lives.",2010

Overwhelmed. Intoxicated with wonder. Such is the magic of Spirited Away.",2002
10,"Spirited Away is one of the most perfect movies I have ever seen. The least I can say about it is that there was not a single moment during it that my attention wasn't completely focused. The plot was fantastic and full-bodied. Each character was given so much personality, even the little soot spiders weren't treated as two-dimensional.",2002
9,"Last year I saw Spirited Away on it's UK release. I've never been a particular fan of anime, and it didn't really occur to me that I was watching a foreign language film dubbed into English (or 'American'). I can't imagine seeing a live action foreign language film dubbed into another language, but hey, this is a kids cartoon, what does it matter? Up to a point it didn't, because I loved the film. I enjoyed it so much I set about digging up the Studio Ghibli/Miyazaki back catalogue, in the process Sprited Away was filed away as one of the lesser Ghibli's - still great, but compared to Laputa, Grave of the Fireflies and a few others, it seemed a little weak. ",2004
10,"Actually I dislike his or her comments badly. If you didn't get it watch it again. This is not a piece to just entertain, the creator has put his own feeling and I believe life experience and the fear always buried in children's mind into it. It is a comely tale that express the creator's thoughts in some way, whilst shining as a attractive animation piece with so many details that you might have ignore if you were careless. It is a rich story and I can see the efforts creators put into it in many spots and frames.",2005
10,This is a wonderfully imaginative and fantastical children's fantasy. It is easy to see why it was perhaps the critical hit of 2002. The film is glorious to look at. It is a testament to old fashioned animation techniques that seem to be resigned to foreign animations. Of course there is some use of computer imagery for certain shots but they blend seamlessly and the overall artistry involved is superlative.,2004
10,"The art work alone is worthy of the engulfment one experiences when watching the big screen, making me wish I had seen it on the big screen.  That is, unless the major release in the US was the English language version. ",2004
10,"I rented this film from Blockbuster after hearing about it from a friend. I was slightly reluctant, never seeing an anime film before, but I watched it six times before giving it back two days later, then bought it the next day. My daughter watched it with me every time and loved it as much as I did. It was an astonishing film, though scary at times, but wonderful the whole way through. It had some laugh out loud funny moments and the next minute you were on the edge of your seat and it all seemed so real. It really got me into anime. Since then I have also watched Howl's moving castle, which is fabulous. My daughter went one step further and learnt to draw manga. I must say she is quite good! She also is learning to play the opening theme on the piano. It's 4 pages long. Rather her than me! I would recommend this film to anybody. But be warned. It's very... different.",2006
10,"That ""Spirited Away"" is a masterpiece would seem to any sane person to be beyond dispute. This is the first of Miyazaki's films I've seen and had it recommended to me by a friend who's into anime. I'm really not keen on Manga at all, so I delayed seeing ""Spirited Away"" for a few months. I finally got around to seeing the subtitled version - never, never waste your time with dubbed versions of foreign movies - over the weekend and I loved every frame of it. The imagination and creativity blew me away and I'd put the film alongside other ""children's"" masterpieces like ""The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe"", Philip Pullman's ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy and Ray Bradbury's poetic ""Something Wicked this Way Comes""..",2005
10,"This movie is an outstanding piece of artwork. I hadn't heard much about it when it was first released. Being a huge Oscar fan, I was surprised when it took home the award for best animated film. At that point, knew nothing about it.",2005
10,"Upon hearing that this became Japan's highest grossing film ever, I went out of my way to look for a theater that had this movie here in the states. I traveled some, paid top dollar for the ticket, and, after seeing it, was totally blown away by the experience I had. I had no doubt in my mind that I have seen the best movie of the year, and quite possibly the best animated movie I have EVER seen.",2005
10,"It is so ironically tragic that many great movies such as Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away are often overlooked by the public, suggesting that commercialism is the way of reflecting the possibility of achieving blockbuster status in the box-office, even as if most of these recycled products receive poor reviews (remember Shark Tale? It's horribly cliché but millions of viewers still watch it). Is it because of technology that drives its influence to the public without providing any necessity that is its substance? Or is it because Spirited Away is considered another ordinary 2D cartoon that should be suitable for little children and not the rest of us? Sadly, this is reality and we all see as it is right now (providing that we live in a topsy-turvy world with unfair paradoxes) but it doesn't mean that Miyazaki's masterpiece has a chance to change our reflections on life. In fact, there are doses of good reasons on why this movie is so special to us, aside from its family-friendly context.",2005
7,The word masterpiece is being thrown around a little bit too much on this one.,2002
10,"I have given movies 10 out 10 stars before, but this just crosses a completely new line into something even above 100% greatness; perfection. This may be the only film I have ever seen that is completely perfect, I would change absolutely nothing about it. The only other film that I would put over the top is, coincedentally, My Neighbor Totoro. The fact that the are made by the same company has nothing to do with it.",2006
10,"Up until the time I viewed this film, I equated the phrase ""Japanese animation"" with phrases like ""Pokemon,"" ""Digimon,"" and other ""mon's,"" that made me want to vomit. Hayao Miyazaki has really opened my eyes and made me realize just how wrong I really was.",2006
8,"How many people can sit through a 120-minute animated film? That's normally just too long for that genre. However, this one could meet that challenge. It only took me two sittings to make it all the way - that's very good, at least for me!",2006
10,"Seldom have I seen a movie full of such boundless fantasy, incredible beauty and opulent pictures. Miyazaki presents the story of Chihiro who has to rescue her parents from the spell of a witch in fantasy world with such extravagant richness that stuns the spectator.",2005
10,"As the rest of the Western world was amazed by the throngs of CGI animation, and the inside Disney jokes, Japanese audiences were given a chance to see what real animation was like. This movie was the first foreign film which grossed over 200 million dollars before it came over the US shores. It had beaten Pixar's Ice Age and Disney's Lilo and Stitch to get Best Animated Feature. Yet with all these facts and figures shown to us, does this movie live up to its hype. In a one word answer, YES!",2003
10,"My previous experience with Studio Ghibli began and ended with 'My Neighbour Totoro' but upon seeing the fantastic 'Spirited Away', I feel as if a whole new world of anime and Hayao Miyazaki has just opened up to me. Until now, apart from the odd Disney flick and, of course, 'My Neighbour Totoro', I had long consigned animation to childhood but this film is a perfect example of how how rich and diverse even an animated film can be.",2004
10,I am speechless... nothing more to say. ,2017
10,"Really, don't wanna spoil anything. Go watch it, it will be a significant anime experience. Also it will teach you life lessons which you will always remember and have it as a picture in your mind. That Chihiro girl didn't achieve anything without hard work and great effort. A lot of main characters turn out extremely lucky, well here's one who actually work her ass of to get what she wanted...",2017
7,"I enjoyed this movie immensely. But, like ""The Phantom Menace,"" I've had a very hard time viewing it objectively. There was so much anticipation leading up to its release, I simply enjoyed the experience of being there. Having read all four books in the series a few times each, I am overly familiar with the events in the story. As I watched the movie, my continuing thought was ""How well will the next part of the story be translated to the screen?"" rather than ""How entertaining is this film overall?"" I have trouble answering the latter question because I was already entertained by watching a wonderful story dramatized, so I'll never know how I'd have reacted had I seen this movie without having read the books.",2001
10,"Once upon a time (and not that long ago), in the vivid, fertile imagination of author J.K. Rowling, a character was born:  A boy.  A young boy named Harry, who was destined to become one of the most beloved characters to emerge from a work of fiction in a long, long time, and was quickly embraced by young and old alike in all corners of the world.  And now, thanks to the magic of the cinema, Harry and his companions fairly leap from the pages of the novel to the silver screen in the phenomenal motion picture, `Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,' directed by Chris Columbus and written for the screen by Steve Kloves.  Indeed, Harry Potter is a boy, but not just any boy; because Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) just happens to be a wizard.  But, orphaned as a baby, Harry has been raised by his Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) and Uncle Vernon Dursley (Richard Griffiths), who never let him in on the fact that he was, well-- what he was.  It seems that Petunia didn't approve of her own sister-- Harry's mother-- because she was a witch; nor of Harry's father because he, too, was a wizard.  When Harry turns eleven, however, the secret is out of the bag when-- after some strange goings-on-- a giant of a man named Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) shows up at the Dursley's door to collect Harry and take him off to `Hogwarts,' a school for wizards and witches and all who would perfect the gift with which they were born:  The gift of magic!  And from the moment Harry boards the train (from station platform nine-and-three-quarters) that will take him to his destiny, the magic is alive-- for Harry, and for the audience, as well; and it's a journey you will never forget.",2001
8,"We live in a world where economics is hard. This forces practical limitations when making a movie. Time and money are sadly finite, cinema owners need to be pleased as well as fans and computer animation ain't perfect. Given these limitations, this film is about as close to human perfection as it is possible to achieve. However, it's extremely clear what an immense challenge it is to turn Philosopher's Stone from book to film.",2001
10,This movie is a delight for those of all ages.,2004
10,"When I knew the film was being made, I thought how could they make a film that would be up to the standard of such a perfect book. But they did! Sure they missed bits out but they captured the essence of the book brilliantly. One member of the cast was mis-cast for me but my children disagreed.I even found myself believing they were flying and not wondering ""how are they doing that?"" So 10 out 10 Warner Brothers. Bring on the next one!",2001
7,HARRY POTTER / (2001) *** (out of four),2001
1,"Many viewers of this film applaud its faithfulness to the book, however they miss that while the film includes much of the book in it (more than is necessary in fact), it lacks the central story.  That is:  the story of a young boy who has suddenly had his wildest dream come true, and who now must deal with his newfound celebrity, his amazing magical heritage, and most of all, day to day life at Hogwarts with his friends (and enemies).  The movie is more preoccupied with populating Hogwarts with ghosts and moving staircases than it is with characters of any depth.  Everyone from the book, Harry included, suffers from a serious lack of on-screen development, and as a consequence the story lurches  ponderously from event to event without the throughline that stong character development would bring.  I, for one, am not easily impressed by effects, no matter how impressive, especially when they are a duplicitous substitute for the real strength of a story such as this:  character.",2001
1,"This film is simply awful, the acting is a joke. Being a fan of the book I decided to buy the DVD without seeing at the cinema or renting it before, but I was extremely dissapointed. Daniel Radcliff's acting is terrible, in my honest opinion he was only hired because he looks like the illustrations of Harry Potter and he is definatly what I had pictured in my mind but his acting makes a mockery out of the film and turns it into a spoof of the book, instead of bringing it to life. I definatly won't be rushing to the shops to get the second film too soon.",2002
1,"It's a movie made for people who think that magic is cute and fun.  If you're a fantasy fan like I am, and believe in magic (in a fictional sense) then you may very well detest this movie, as I did.  Magic comes easily to little Harry Potter, who has no personality to speak of except that he is occasionally sad that he never met his mum and dad.  Years of abuse and neglect have left not a mark on him, so when he gets invited to Hogwarts Academy of Magic, he has nowhere for his character to go.  There he flies around on his broomstick and gets to be a big hero quite by accident without ever confronting any serious obstacles or anything resembling a plot.  In all this, the film is an excellent adaptation of the book, which also thought that magic is cutesy wootesy.",2001
1,"At first I liked the Harry Potter series, it was imaginative, it was original, it was funny, and it had promise. Then the second one came out, ""oh WOW this is heaven, it can't get better than this"", then the third came out, ""I was wrong about the second, because this is awesome"". Then in between finishing the third and the release of the fourth I read the Lord of the Rings. And shortly after, the movies for both came out. I realized the huge difference, I was psyched out when I heard they were making a Harry Potter movie, but there they go and ruin it. Did you know Spielberg was originally supposed to direct, until Miss Rowling insisted it HAD to be an all British cast, in walks in Chris Columbus, a guy who directed Robin Williams in becoming a woman in ""Mrs. Doubtfire"", and a guy who's obviously willing to give in to any demand thrown at him by the author as long as he makes money. Well Mr. Columbus seemed to direct Ron into acting like a woman as well. You throw in a B list of child actors and a list of acclaimed adult actors who are far past their prime and who only opted to make these films because their grandchildren begged them to, and you have the first Harry Potter movie. There has never been a more horrific performance than that of Rupert Grint, who now dominates the worst performances of all time, kicking Jake Lloyd from The Phantom Menace out of the way. Daniel Radcliffe doesn't really possess much talent either, I highly doubt he has any future after this film, as far as acting goes anyways. As for Emma Watson, who thinks she's the best in the world, and if you think I'm talking about her performance as Hermione, you're dead wrong, have you listened to her in interviews? The room can barely fit the three of them; her, the interviewer, and her ego. Her performance is also astonishingly bad. I forgot to mention the horrible special effects, I have seen better on TV watching ""Power Rangers"". I mentioned the Lord of the Rings earlier to make reference to the obvious ripoffs of Miss Rowling. Firstly there are the dementors, cloaked ghostlike figures whose faces you never see (cough, RINGWRAITHS!). The whomping willow seems to ring a bell (ENTZ). The Giant Spider named Aragog (SHELOB). The trolls also seem to resemble something I've seen before... OH YEAH, the trolls in Lord of the Rings! Hopefully Warner Bros. choice of hiring different directors for the rest of the films will pay off. But this is the perfect example of a book that could have made an Oscar worthy classical movie, but fell short because instead of making it what it was intended to be they chose to skimp on the effects to make more money on little kids who think it's great because they're too young to watch real special effects in Star Wars or LotR. It really makes me sad, because in the months prior to the first movie I was marveling at the promise of it all. Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, they got John Williams to do the score, and like that, it was ruined. Although it does seem that my opinion differs from the rest of the world as Miss Rowling is just raking it in and so are the filmmakers, making even more money by skimping on the special effects that will no doubt succeed in dazzling children who aren't yet potty trained. Here's one buck the woman won't get her hands on.",2005
2,"What i really do not get is why so many people like this film? Having read the book first i truly fund it awful. I completely understand that bits have to be cut for time but why add in scenes that add nothing (why was there no peeves?). Also Daniel Radcliffes acting is just awful. The scene where he is told that he is a wizard makes me want to cry. Also the character of run could have had some more insightful lines than ""bloody hell"". I really was expecting this to be great knowing how good the book was but the film let me underwhlemed. Some character also completely miss the mark. Draco malfoy is way over done, instead of being snidely nasty but in this comes across as pantomime bad. The only upshot of the film is Alan Rickman's Snape is spot on, Robbie coltrane just about makes a reasonable Hagrid but Emma Watson's Hermione is surprisingly good and upstages the other two so much that it makes some timid scenes almost seem watchable.",2006
1,"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, as it is called everywhere else besides the US, and I'd like to know why, is no more than a 5th rate failure at best.  Now I know I'm probably enraging every single person who has read the novel, however this movie is not the novel.  Book and Film are two totally different mediums.  Something that works in a novel, wont decessarily work on the big screen.  Harry Potter is the greatest example of that.",2001
1,"I have not read any Harry Potter books.  Be that as it may, when the glowing reviews started to come in for this film I decided to take a look at it.  I cannot comment on the translation from book to film or the quality of Rowling's books but the film of the very first novel is quite horrible.  I tried to like it, but I found it excruciating to watch.  It took me no where and, even worse, it really didn't have much of a plot.  The thin shreds of plot were introduced 1 hour and 45 minutes into the film.  The first part of the film was obviously conceived to give a background to the viewer of the Potter world.  Unfortunately there was little to grip me here and I found most of it to be grossly out of place.  What the heck does a game of ""Quidditch"" have to do with the story?  It, and many other things, were just eye candy.  The characters were stale and seemed like rejects from a Roald Dahl story (see James and the Giant Peach).  I'm flabbergasted that such a piece of junk has attracted so many adamant fans.  No wonder kids don't know how to read or write very well anymore.  No wonder Britney Spears and N'Sync are so possible.  The piece of trash that is Harry Potter explains it all - the current generation will cling to anything as long as they don't have to think for themselves.  'Tis a pity.",2001

1,"This film was to put it simply rubbish. The child actors couldn't act, as can be seen by Harry's supposed surprise on learning he's a wizard. ""I'm a wizard!"" is said with such indifference you'd think he's not surprised at all. I've never read the books and this film did nothing to make me want to read them. The only spell this cast over me was one to get me out of the room as quickly as possible every time I have seen this on after my first viewing of it in the cinema. If you want to see a decent book made film watch Lord of the Rings or possibly the sequel to this which I thought was actually good. 1/10",2002

The movie captivated my attention like nothing before and I became so interested in anything that had to do with this movie, and I heard that it was made after a book. I didn't had Internet back then, but I found the first book at a library and convinced my mother to buy it. That's how I became obsessed with reading and writing.",2007

1,"In 2001, the Harry Potter posters were everywhere in Hong Kong. I decided to go to the movie. However, I was very disappointed. I did not understand what the movie is about until I read the book. I think J. K. Rowling did a good job in writing the story but the movie makes no sense at all. All the plots are not linked up. The characters are bad. Daniel Radcliffe is a very bad actor. Many other better actors could be chosen. I think he was chosen just because he looks like the Harry Potter on the front cover of the book. The costumes are bad. The special effects are bad. The entire movie is not bad but very very very bad.",2008
1,"This movie was so corny and unimaginative, a real Chris Colombus piece of hack work. The great cast saves the film from being utter dreck, but otherwise this is pretty dim, formulaic movie-making. Compare it to its announced competition, movies like The Wizard of Oz,  Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, The Never Ending Story, or even more recent fare like The Secret Garden or Photographing Fairies. C'mon, you've got to admit this flick is mediocre at best. Stop lapping up the hype and buying into every stupid trend they throw at you. Discriminate a little.",2001

To keep it short, however, I will just go ahead and say, never in my life have I been or have felt so happy while watching a TV show. From episode one on wards I knew that this was going to be my show, you know? I just had that feeling, that particular, good feeling. I was really looking forward to watching this from the start. When I got into Smallville, it had been off TV for a while, but I used to watch random episodes here and there about ten years back - I just never found the time to get properly into it. When I did, man was I glad. It is simply the greatest series ever made, in my opinion.",2016

They complained about this or that not fitting in just right with how Superman mythology worked, and in the end they were never satisfied. But they didn't get the point of the show. Smallville isn't about Superman. It's not about superpowers. It's not about relationships or about superheroes. Smallville is, and always was, about growing up. Starting off with Clark Kent in high school and sending him off getting married to Lois Lane, Smallville is ten years of finding your way.",2016
10,"First of all this is one of the best TV Series that i have ever watched. Graphic wise yes it is not good but who cares? Who knew clark kent had such an immense childhood. This just does not revolve around ONLY Clark kent, it showed us who is Jonathan Kent, what was the purpose of clark kent on planet earth, martha kent, and specially chloe. Now we know why Superman is at the peak of all superhero list, not because of his powers but because of his humanity. ",2017
10,"This is a great series. I would like to see it go on forever - beginning to end - and not just as the title states Smallville Beginnings. I've watched a lot of series - Lost, Prison Break, Dexter, Heroes, Supernatural, etc. - , but none of them is like this one. If they kept ""The young and the restless"" going for 6.000 episodes, than the tale of Superman should be no different.",2010

It introduces many important themes and explains Clark's later choices as Superman. ",2016

10,"I've watched the first five episodes of the first season of Smallville and I just want to say I'm glad they decided to make a TV show about Clark Kent's life as a teenager in Smallville because most movies that are based on Superman never really focused on that part of Superman's mythos like Clark Kent growing up in Smallville, being a high school student and his love for Lana Lang.It's a nice combination of adventure, drama, science fiction and romance. In fact, it has pretty much everything that makes a great TV show: smart characters, a wonderful cast, excellent acting, a good theme song, a nice setting and sharp story lines. I particularly like relationship between Clark Kent and Lana Lang. Not only is Kristin Kreuk a pretty face but she also does wonderfully playing Clark's love interest. And Clark will do almost anything to win her heart of Lana and he must also compete with her boyfriend, Whitney. I also like how they made Clark friends with Lex Luther after Lex ends up in a car crash and Clark saves his life, Lex feels he owes everything to Clark and will help him out with anything whether it's trying to help his family or trying to win over Lana. And I like how they come up with a different villain in each episode with a different superpower. It's too bad Smaillvile only has a rating of 7.5 on IMDb because I think it's up there with other great superhero TV shows like Gotham or Daredevil even though I've heard the show went downhill after the first season. But I'm just going to continue to enjoy watching the first season.",2016
4,"When I first heard about 'Smallville', I was very excited and had high hopes for it, expecting something a bit like the Nineties cartoon version of 'The X-Men' where the characters remained true to the essence of the comic book and the stories were involving. 'Smallville' had the potential to be a great show in depicting the updated version of Clark Kent's boyhood years before the boy became the Superman.",2006
4,"The story presented in Smallville is a teen/love story/soap opera which is not my cup of tea but I have no problem with it. What I do have a problem with is that it uses the names Clark,Lana,Lois,Lex,Martha,Jonathan,Smallville, etc. I was a boy in the 50's and 60's and these names told me that this was going to be a story about Superman or Superboy. The story is an extreme adaptation of that story. It should be called ""Pretty Darned Good Man"" or some soap opera title like ""Fred's Landing"". Superboy was not a dark character filled with doubt and fear, at least not the one in the comic book stories I grew up with. This one is much more like Peter Parker which is fine, but that's another story altogether. I was briefly sucked into this for seasons 1-3, but finally realized the story was not going where I thought it was and bailed out. Fortunately, I discovered the old Superman, the one I read about when I was a boy, and he lives on in ""All Star Superman"" comics.",2007
10,"Being a great fan of the superman-franchise, I have always been a bit disappointed that there never has been a perfectly made superman-adaptation (Man of steel was great, but cannot tip this great series). Nevertheless this series seems to top every superman-movie ever made. The casting is without doubt tremendous. Tom Welling does a great job as Clark Kent, as no other he shows the true nature of superman (namely a man with a pure heart who believes there's good in everyone), after three seasons comes Erica Durance (who plays Lois Lane), the creators of this series had search a long time after this actress, but this was not in vane. The magic that sparkles between Durance and Willing is so addictive that you just can't stop watching this series. ",2014

1,"OK, I'm new on the website and only wrote one review for a Brazilian movie, but I've just watched another commercial for TV series ""Smallville"" and that kind of pushes me to express my dislike for this show. I originally wanted to rate this with a zero but it's alright, you can use this point to rate the actress who plays Lois Lane, although she sucks she is amazingly good looking. I find this show completely untrue to the hole ""Superman universe"", it's filled with cheap sensationalism (like a Micheal Bay's movie) just to start. The show was supposed to focus on the character Clark Kent and his growing, but all we see are totally crappy stories with supervillans and hot babes. Imagine what is going to happen to Smallville after Clark decides to move to Metropolis, there won't be any hero left to save the town from every amazingly impossible event (that, for some bizarre reason, happens every weak) and the town will be eventually destroyed. Plus what is wrong with the people from Smallville? Every now and then they almost die and yet they insist one living in that ""Godless"" place. If Lana were to be real she would have moved from there a long ago as the supervillans (who are truly unoriginal) tend to want to kill her very often. I could go on and on and on about how much I feel this show sucks, there are just too many down-points (believe me I've only mentioned a few cuz I can't believe I'm writing a review for this). When the pilot was on I tough this would be an interesting show, showing us how was Superman growing up and everything. But ,as one figures, they just didn't have enough material to hold the Clark Kent saga for too long, but someone figured out that this show was a ""moneymaker"". Why stop the show if we're getting rich? No, let's just make it crappy with no storyline and just Superman fighting super villains without his cape and hot babes (that always works). Seriously this show gets on my nerve because of it's popularity. Well whatever, you're free to watch what you want, I'm not watching this s***!",2006
