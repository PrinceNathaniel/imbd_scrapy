1,"I went to see this yesterday. I actually regret doing it. The moment it ended there was general booing and disappointment in the theater. Not a single applause. Throughout this film, I got to see more than 10 people walking out of the theater. I left after the credits ended with a terrible headache and the nausea of a lifetime. It got so bad that I actually had to take a Dramamine pill when I was back at my place.",2008
1,"Spoilers... Really now, what's to spoil? Story lines don't come any thinner than this. Synopsis: Huge monster appears out of nowhere, destroys city, everybody dies, the end. There isn't any sense of commitment to the main characters, who after the random, gratuitous intro spend their time running around screaming. There is no suspense, no explanation, no point. Predictably, the full view of the monster is saved for last, when even the appalling camera work (yes, I KNOW it's intentional) can't disguise the mediocre CGI, nor the lack of inspiration among the monster-designers. Equally predictable, the nasty foot-soldiers it drops look like big spiders  contact with which will make you feel ill and eventually reduce you to an Alien-plagiarism. One does wonder why American filmmakers are so eager to destroy their big cities, especially after 9/11 has provided us with bone chilling imagery that will make any movie of this kind look silly in comparison for decades to come. Not just silly, actually; the way 9/11-like images are opportunistically recycled in this cinematic non-event struck me as rather tasteless. A BBC reviewer quite rightly called it 'plain 9/11 porn'. The makers have worked under the false assumption that 'live', shaky camera-work in dark surroundings will lift it all to a high level of hip artistry, but really, all it does is give you a headache. Any inexperienced klutz suffering from advanced Parkinson would get steadier handycam images than the guy supposedly holding the thing during these exasperating 75 minutes. It's all a very poor Blair Witch rip-off. Add to that the prevailing darkness and half the time you simply haven't got a clue what you're looking at: as a viewer, I felt insulted. This isn't 'intriguing' or 'artistic' or 'novel', it's just sheer, lax arrogance. Avoid at all costs.",2008
1,After seeing the viral campaign with extremely well done fake news footage I had high hopes for this movie. I've always been a lover of the monster movie/horror genre...hell I even sort of enjoyed the Godzilla remake despite it's many failings and strong smell of cheese but Cloverfield? well what can I say...,2008
1,It appears that the writers had the idea of the Statue of Liberty having its head roll down a street and then struggled like crazy to pad the rest of the movie. Hence it is extremely short and extremely bad.,2008
1,"... I do not believe that digital camera survived a nuke. I'm sorry, there you go. That was the final nail in the coffin for this movie, it just heaps one immersion-breaking sequence of events after another.",2008
1,I have to hand it to JJ Abrams....we fell for this flick hook line and sinker.,2008
1,Cloverfield is the type of film that asks so much from its audience and delivers so little. Right from the start it basically gets down on its hands and knees begging and pleading everyone to take it seriously.,2008
1,"If you like screaming through the whole movie and a home movie effect where the camera holder is totally useless and cant stay upright or in perspective you MAY like this. Besides strobe like effects and completely ridiculous situations, ie: helicopter falls from 39 stories+ and only the 3 heroes survive, a 39 story building leaning on its opposite counterpart and the hero climbing stairs, crossing the roof, removing his live girlfriend from reo stuck through her chest and climbing down again while video is swaying to and fro? STUPID. Good effects if you can follow them and not a bad monster. Put me off the director for good I think. And I am a sci-fi nut. And what is ""Cloverfield""?",2008
1,What on earth is this movie doing with a 8.1/10 rating?,2008
1,i went in expecting a scary monster movie.,2008
2,"Even if you can tolerate the shaky hand syndrome of an entire movie shot handy-cam, the poor dialog and weak, uninteresting plot will make you just as nauseous.",2008
1, SPOILER ALL THE WAY ,2008
1,"This has got to be the worst monster movie I have ever seen! Wait, not worst monster movie, worst MOVIE PERIOD! The whole movie is laughable. I sat there in the theater and wanted to know if and when anything was going to start. First, it take almost 25 minutes before this movie even starts to get interesting, and after all of the useless banter of party guests and drunken camera wedding style say ""hi"" to Rob before he goes to Japan B.S., things start to happen, but slowly. And let me tell you that they could have just use the footage from the trailer and skip about 20 of the most boring minutes of the whole film. That feeling of initial excitement is short lived. As you keep watching nothing happens that keeps your interest. Second, the monster, you get little glimpses of it until about 60-70 minutes into the film, and you get a very big disappointment, it's not Godzilla, a T-Rex, or anything that is even remotely familiar, fun or scary. It looks like someone put the body parts in the wrong places. And it's offspring, there are only three spots in the film that they are even used, as if an after thought. They are used to make two extremely boring parts of the movie more exciting, and it fails miserably. Obviously used to make a short film a tad bit longer. They even look like they where stolen them from Starship Troopers. Both monster and offspring are so underdeveloped, that they just don't work together. If JJ Abrams brought anything back from Japan, it wasn't how to make a monster movie. I'll tell you this, the Japanese are laughing at us all over again! There will be no Cloverfield monster for sale at every little store like all the Godzilla's all over Japan. JJ, Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez called! They want their cameras back, they want to start filming Blair Witch 3! In short, I know, too late, DO NOT WAIST YOUR MONEY ON THIS FILM! The best part of the movie was the ride home.",2008
4,"I hope this isn't the new standard of movie genre. If it is, its worse than torture porn.. and I know they're working on a hand-held zombie film using this same technique. *shudder* The reality is in order for movies like this to work, the characters have to be borderline, intellectually retarded in order to validate why they would even consider getting close enough to the monsters, or whatever enemy, to make for a good film. This makes the hand-held film maker's inevitable and formulaic demise so much more anticlimactic because anyone with any common sense would not be running in the direction of a giant unknown creature dropping monster lice all over the city. This tends to ruin any sense of empathy for the character.",2008
1,"I've just seen this movie on a DVD and I'm so bothered for wasting 90 Min's of my time on something like this, even if i have nothing to do in my life.",2008
1,"What a waste of time and money. This movie would have been good if the camera was put down and a film was made. When the attack began the director should have the camera dropped then pan out and the movie start. Film the characters running and trying to rescue their friend. But, the way the movie was videotaped made the footage jerky and nauseating to watch. The fighting between the army and the ""monster"" was good, but again left you with too many unanswered questions. Besides, when a rescue helicopter takes off they do not fly parallel to the danger, they would fly away from danger. The ending was empty and left the viewers full of questions. Nothing was ever explained. Just stay at home and watch some home movies taped by your three year old. Might make more sense.",2008
8,"I attended an early screening 1/10/08 at Michigan State University. I've spoilerized in case anyone doesn't want to know anything about the film, but I will try to stay away from anything that'll be too overt.",2008
9,"Some people have derisively compared this film to The Blair Witch Project because it was all told from the point of view of someone's shaking camera. Unless you have motion sickness, I don't think that's a bad thing. What matters is who's in front of the camera. While The Blair Witch Project featured annoying people screaming at each other, this movie actually made me care about the characters. In fact if it had continued with the romantic drama tone established during the first half hour, I STILL think it would have been worth watching and that's the biggest compliment I can give it.",2008
1,"I am more of a ""vote and not post"" person but I have to at least get the word out that this movie is terrible!! People just need to AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS . . . . not your wallet costs!! 20 minutes of Blair Witch type camera-work for a going-away-party. The rest with unsteady camera shots that totally gave me a migraine headache. Horrible!! Storyline was poor and VERY slow. I kept finding moments to just close my eyes and try to make the agony stop. The ending was one of those where you look at your movie companion(s) and say, ""ummm, is that it??? oh wait, there has to be more"" and you sit and sit and realize that it's over. My friend and I agree that it is a mix of Blair Witch meets Starship Troopers meets Aliens.",2008
1,"Well, I clicked spoiler, but the spoiler is that there are no spoilers. Nothing to the movie.",2008
1,"Hey, have ten bucks and two hours of your life to blow? Why not try Cloverfield! If you like motion-sickness inducing, hand-held, close-up, can't-focus-on-anything movies (a.k.a., anything by Michael Bay) then this is a movie for you and your six second attention span! Wait ... what was I saying? Oh yeah, there's this thing that runs rampant on Manhattan. No one knows what the hell it is, it's just there. In the meantime all of the monster crap interrupts a very special episode of Dawson's Creek, you know, the one where Dawson's going to leave for Japan and he finds out at the party that Joey's been sleeping around on him? Alright, now picture that, filmed with your dad's handycam in the middle of a Godzilla movie. It's a big sh!te sandwich coupled on either side by two slices of moldy bread. That's how fresh and satisfying of a movie this is.",2008
1,"I will admit, the marketing scheme behind this awfulness was clever. I mean, I like a good thrill ride monster movie. The Creature From the Black Lagoon piqued my curiosity as a youngster as I marveled at the brilliance of trying to understand something that has no explanation. However, it's hard to have this curiosity, no matter how intriguing the monster is, when the script is so tired its in a coma.",2008
1,"I never comment on movies, but this was just horrific. Not only does the filming make you sick to your stomach, but the actual movie was bad. They never explain what the monster is or how it came to be, they don't let you know what happens to the characters, nor do they give any follow up on anything. Horrible. People left the theaters so angry that they paid to see this piece of garbage, myself included. I'm so angry. I sat through the entire movie with my head in my hands because of the shaking camera, and besides that, the movie had no conclusion. It literally just ends. I am extremely disappointed and I feel cheated that I even invested $11.25 and almost 2 hours of my time.",2008
1,"There were two interesting things about seeing this movie, unfortunately neither of them were things directly in the movie itself. To speak bluntly this movie was terrible. Honestly I wouldn't even call it a movie, that would imply the existence of a plot line. The movie was what it pretended to be, raw footage. The acting was lacking at best, the only way I would give them more credit is if the dialog was improvised on the spot, which it *might* have been. The cinematography would have been original had this movie been released in 1998 or anytime before the Blair Witch Project. I nearly walked out ten minutes into the movie once I realized the entire film was shot from a shaky hand held camera.",2008
9,"It was nice to finally watch movie that didn't seem like anything I'd ever seen before. This, much like Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"" and ""Children of Men"", completely immerses you in this incredible situation with absolutely no knowledge to comfort you. It's very disorienting, which adds to the experience; you never figure out what the hell is going on but you're so into survival that you put it past you. You're placed with a bunch of characters whom you get to know and eventually must join in their frenzied search for a friend while being subjected to some horrifying imagery and new threats.",2008
6,"If you want a good movie about Henry VIII and Anne Bolyen, rent Anne of the Thousand Days. That was a film that used history to tell a story about real people who had a love to change a nation. ",2008
3,"The ""Other Boleyn Girl"" hit theaters today, and of course, I was in for the first showing. I've been anticipating this movie for over 2 years now, ever since I first heard it was in production. ",2008
7,"A quick glimpse at the Tudor family line on Wikipedia will yield hundreds of years of made-for-movie material, but none quite as compelling as the story of Anne Boleyn. Pair a classic story with airy language, beautiful sets and costumes, and some A-list names and you have Oscar magic in the making. Right? Well, not always. We've seen it before and we're not necessarily impressed with royalty anymore. The Other Boleyn Girl offers new perspectives and dramatic angles on the saga of wives that is Henry VIII's legacy, but nearly drowns in melodrama.",2008
5,"All and all, not a particularly enjoyable film.",2008
6,"Overall, the movie is entertaining. I thought the acting was good, particularly Scarlett Johansson's. The cinematography and editing leave much to be desired, and the entire movie seems rushed. If you have any knowledge of Tudor history,you will recognize the many inaccuracies, but those did not bother me as much as did the fact that important characters were omitted, undeveloped, or even seemingly forgotten (as in the case of Mary's husband, William Carey).",2008
7,"I went to watch this movie knowing that even though the historical figures are real, the story is basically fiction, only Philippa Gregory's version of the tragedy of Anne Boleyn. Watching this film with this attitude really helped me enjoy it rather than be upset that all the historic characters' personalities were so distorted that they were almost unrecognizable. I suggest anyone else going to see this movie adopt this attitude too.",2008
1,"I am all for trying to do something different, trying to make some new and intriguing point about this or that... no, wait, I guess I'm not. At any rate, whatever they tried to do with this freakosaurus of a ""historical"" movie, they completely and unforgivably failed at. I know this bit of history well, and have seen most treatments of it in movies and TV shows; even the irreverent and sensationalist Tudors TV show is a masterstroke of brilliance compared to the pondscum that is The Other Boleyn Girl.",2010
7,"The Tudors are very chic at the moment. If it isn't ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" (awful) or the television series, ""The Tudors"" (soft-pornographic trash), then it is ""The Other Boleyn Girl"", the latest film written by the Oscar nominated screenwriter, Peter Morgan. After his work on the Golden Globe winning TV film ""Longford"" and the Oscar winning (for its lead actors) ""The Queen"" and ""The Last King of Scotland"", his scripts must be in demand by actors across the globe. Little wonder then that this film attracts a stellar cast, including Eric Bana, Scarlett Johansson and Natalie Portman. So, why is it that this film, which is filled with great talent and potential, delivers only satisfaction? This was originally slated for release late last year, right in the middle of the awards season. Yet, for some reason, it was moved back. Why this was done is not widely known, but, as the IMDb had the film listed as completed last autumn, I should think that the decision was taken that this film would draw more attention outside of the congested awards season. Watching the film, you are aware of the ambition and lavish costumes that would draw the gaze of Oscar. But the film lacks punch, depth and the power to grip you the whole way through.",2008
1,"OK, I will admit that since I am descended from Mary Boleyn,I do have a bit of family honor at stake here....",2009
2,"This story is not close to being correct. First off, Anne was the younger sister (born in 1510). Mary was the mistress to King Francis of France she returned to England with Mary, Queen of France after the death of the French King Louis She became Henry's lover. She became pregnant and was married off to William Carey. The King NEVER acknowledged her child as his. Anne was STILL in France with Queen Claude. She was never banished to France. She returned to England when Henry changed allegiances from France to Spain. When Anne returned she fell in love with Harry Percy (who was NOT betrothed to anyone) It was a love match. The King saw Anne and became besotted. He had Cardinal Wolsey separate them and then Percy was married off to Mary Talbot. Henry adored Anne. He was never anything but generous to her and she hated him only a little less than she hated The Cardinal Wolsey. She blamed them for separating her from her love, Harry Percy. The King pursued her and she refused him, this went on for 6 years. she finally fell in love with him. They married (after he split from Rome) and were happy. Elizabeth was born, and Henry changed the Act of Succession to make Elizabeth his heir. It wasn't until the second death of a stillborn son that Henry had had enough. The saucy temperament and sharp tongue he loved in the beginning began to wear on him in the end. One of the greatest historical quotes is from Anne in the Tower ""when I no longer hated him, he began to hate me""",2008
3,"""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is one of those films that is so boring that you start picking out the logical errors with the plot. To begin with, Henry VIII's private life has been the subject of countless films. Unless a movie can provide a fresh take on this familiar subject matter, then there is no point in making it. ",2009
7,"The second half of this movie almost gave me a BLOODY HEART ATTACK! MAN THAT WAS DISTURBING! Ignore the false advertisements that make this movie look like a romantic bodice-ripper. One can call it a soap-opera, but you CANNOT call it a romantic period drama! For those of yous who don't know your Tudor history don't worry, you don't need too (on second thought it'll probably be better if you don't know the story), just treat this as a FICTIONAL eye-opener (and yes, it is extremely historically incorrect) OKay...disturbing themes and historical inaccuracies aside, the movie has brilliant acting by it's leads. Johansson is very capable and believable as Mary (yes, I know...I'm shocked too), whilst Portman is psychotically intense as Anne (I'll explain later). The supporting cast is decent, Kristen Scott Thomas is morally in-tune in the Boleyns' mother and Jim Sturgess is BRILLIANT as their tragic brother George.",2008
8,Never have I seen an actress take control of a movie as much as Portman did with Boleyn. She stepped into the role so perfectly and did it was so much confidence. I could feel her pain and ambition. I started shaking during her downward spiral and couldn't stop. It was so intense and heart pounding.,2008
1,"Mary was of course Anne's older sister,not younger,and she and her siblings were pimped by their social climbing father the appalling Thomas Boleyn(even the name ""Boleyn"" was an affectation borrowed from the French Court,their real names was ""Bullen"").The overall feeling is that if Henry had a taste for bestiality Boleyn would have pimped one of his wolfhounds. ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is trash,basically.Only Miss S.Johansson escapes unscathed as ""The King's Great Matter"" is presented as a bodice - ripper that almost plays like a badly - written satire about the Tudor Court. Eric Bana is lousy as Henry the Eighth,portraying England's last all - powerful king as a spoiled 14 year old.Here was a sophisticated,learned man seen as a bearded Zac Effron. There were no feminists in Tudor England,whatever thoughts Lady Boleyn,who had allegedly been Henry's mistress as a young woman, might have had about the King's conduct about her children she kept to herself in order to survive. Mary Boleyn bore the King's Bastard and kept her head when many about her were losing theirs - a not inconsiderable achievement. That may be a subject worthy of a movie,but one would hope that it might be rather better than this load of tosh.",2010
7,"When I first saw the trailer for The Other Boleyn Girl, I have to admit, it looked good, but like it wasn't accurate. I am a huge history buff, especially in the time of England's dark ages, I am fairly familiar with the Boleyn sisters and their affections for King Henry, Anne being the second wife to be executed for committing adultery and not birthing a son heir to the thrown, her life was absolutely horrific if you think about how hard it was to be a woman in this era. I was a little scared that they wouldn't portray her well in this film, but my mom and I saw The Other Boleyn Girl today and even though I'm not fully satisfied with the portrayal of Anne, the movie is still very good. The story has a Hollywood layer to give the story a little more ""oomph"" sort of speak, like most other pictures, but The Other Boleyn Girl is still a very decent movie.",2008
5,"Don't trust either good or bad critics upon ""The Other Boleyn Girl"". It's a serious thing to castigate such a bold work. First of all, this movie is a mediocre adaptation of a heart-breaking novel of late epochs of the English kingdom and the royal family. This work of art(both novel and the movie) has a courage to reveal the unknown reasons of English kingdom becoming less potent with the Renaissance revolution from Italy, and losing the support of the Pope and the Roman Catholic Church, accordingly becoming adversaries with Italy.",2008
1,"What a disappointment. I had been looking forward to seeing this and it was a bust! I've read the book and know a lot about the history of Anne Boleyn and Henry VIII and this was just awful. The rape scene was the worst! When baby Henry was born and he did not go to see him was the second worst! I just wish they could have been more accurate with the facts of history but maybe this is just too big a topic/story for a short movie. Much better as a miniseries. I also think it just all felt rushed. It would have been nice to see some more pleasant interaction between Anne and the king. King Henry had a smoldering quality, but the chemistry was lacking with Anne. He really seemed to have more affection for Mary - why was a mystery. Just did not like the movie at all.",2008
1,The Other Boleyn Girl **SPOILER** Throughout the film there were a few sniggers at some of the incredibly bad scripting (Obviously geared towards the American market- as there were regular bits were the evil Uncle would describe exactly what was going on or would happen in the future and the historical inaccuracies were pretty major). Some of it was cringeworthy in just how bad it was (especially the final scene with the slow fade to black- a picture of a red headed girl and a subtitle explaining how 'Elizabeth would go on to rule England for 40 years ' (or whatever- I didn't read it properly as I was in such a rush to leave).,2008
3,"Every time an historical event or adaptation is put on our screens we expect some degree of historical inaccuracy, dramatical freedoms, mostly perhaps to allow for a limited time a film can run. This historical adaptation is just plain poor and awful. In fact this film perfectly illustrates why Hollywood is in dire trouble if it continues to produce nosh like this. Over the past years, we are now offered TV shows with high production values, good actors, well scripted stories. This recent TV production has raised the bar and expectations of viewers. If Hollywood and cinema production still thinks it can continue to factory produce material such as this, I certainly fear for it's future. Take this film and compare it to the series recently shown on UK TV - The Tudors. There is nothing in the Tudors; costumes, acting, screenplay, editing, script, etc, etc., that is not better than this.",2008
7,"I think that the main critics done to this film came from those who don't like Natalie or Scarlett. I hope it has nothing to do with the the fact that it is a costum movie - I personally found this film an excellent piece of drama, as well as the book was (I think it's an awesome reading, too!). A perfect cast, a good storyline and a strong screenplay are the main reasons that made ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" a wonderful screen adaptation - and both Portman and Johansson revealed themselves in one of their best performance ever! I also believe that the choice of casting two of the most brilliant and famous young actresses in Hollywood (perhaps the best ones, right now) was a smart move from the movie producers and - as well as the most fascinating thing about it is the rivalry between the two sisters - let it able to do captivate young people's attention. I really hope this film is going to be a good hit - at least to receive good reviews from the critis...",2008
10,"I didn't know much going in, aside from the exceptional cast, featuring Eric Bana, Natalie Portman, and Scarlett Johanson. But watching it left me breathless. The story was thoroughly engrossing and kept a great pace, leading to a fantastic conclusion. The actors really get to shine in this character driven story. And stylistically, the film is pitch perfect. I think that just about everyone will find something enjoyable in this film. It's a great date movie, and very thought-provoking at the same time.",2008
2,"The Other Boleyn Girl probably marks the debut of an adaptation of the most intriguing tale of English Royal history. However, very poorly does the film actually describe the events. I must say that probably the only accurate part of this movie is the inevitable ending--which I won't give away because there may be a few who don't actually know what happens.",2008
9,"I was truly impressed today by the film, ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" for me its getting the new film year off to a very good start!! Weve known about Ann Boleyn and her beheading but this film gives new insight into reasons why ,and the amazing relationship between Ann and her sister Mary.. The plot line never gets dull and moves at a great pace..(usually historical films can be stodgy and boring) This one never lets up..The performances are wonderful , especially,Natalie Portman as Ann and Scarlett Johnansen as Mary... the entire supporting cast is outstanding..The sets and costumes are very authentic.,and the cinematography is beautiful Im not sure how historically accurate this film is ,but as a movie its well worth seeing Don't miss ""The Other Boleyn Girl""",2008
1,"After reading the book I could not wait for the DVD, but what a let down. Had they read the book before making the film or checked the history, I guess not. The story seems to be about Anne Boleyn not Mary. Mary's first born was a girl called Catherine and her second child was a boy called Harry both thought to be King Henry's, even though her first husband was mentioned nothing was mentioned about the death of her first husband William Carey, years later she married her second husband Lord Stafford. When Elizabeth was born she was raised in Hatfield along with Mary her half sister, Mary Boleyn did not take Elizabeth as betrayed at the end of the film but Anne did try adopt Mary Boleyn's son Harry.",2009
9,"For those who might not know the name, director Martin McDonagh is an Irish playwright who won the Oscar last year for his short film ""Six Shooter"" about a chance encounter on a train, and that film's star Brendan Gleeson has returned as Ken, one of two hit men sent to the medieval city of Bruges in Belgium along with his partner Ray (Colin Farrell) to rest and lay low after a hit gone horribly wrong. Ray is a miserable bastard who makes it clear he's not happy about being in Bruges, but Ken convinces him that their boss Harry has a job for them there, as well as allowing them a chance for some sightseeing, none of which improves Ray's mood. Things look up when he meets the beautiful local woman Chloe, played by French actress Clémence Poésy--you may remember her as Fleur Delacore in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire--and scores himself a date, which also goes horribly wrong due to Ray shooting off his big mouth. From there things continue to go south as Ray and Ken get into all sorts of messes and meet strange characters, all of whom will play a part in the larger picture.",2008
9,"...in Bruges. Two Irish hit men (Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell) are sent into hiding by their British boss (Ralph Fiennes) in Bruges, Belgium after a botched job only to learn that the most damning job awaits one of them just around the corner. Bruges is a picturesque tourist trap built around the oldest and best maintained medieval city in Belgium. Director and screenwriter Martin McDonagh bleeds the setting and the material for all its worth and makes his feature film debut in superb style.",2008
8,"Going into this movie, I didn't have the highest expectations for it. However, I went to see it anyways, and let me just say that by the end credits I was completely shocked out how much I actually liked this movie. It was not only very funny but you were able to connect with the characters in a way you didn't think you would. The plot was def. very interesting and kept my attention the whole way through. Only real problem I had with the movie was that it was a little bit too long, but it didn't take away from anything. I should also say that I'm not a huge Colin Farrell fan, but after this movie I believe that he has proved that he can hold his own with the other leading men out there. I thought there were some beautiful moments that they captured on film where you see him dealing with his characters inner demons. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for something ""different"", if you're sick of seeing the same ""hollywood-esque"" movies, then please give this movie a shot. If anything, enjoy it for the witty dialogue.",2008
8,"A European film through and through, showing its deep theatrical roots, ""In Bruges"" works on may levels, and is a fine night at the cinema.",2008
8,"I've used IMDb for years but have never felt the urge to post a review until now. I had the pleasure of attending an advanced screening of this movie in NYC last night to which Colin Farrell attended. I bought the screening tickets just wanting to bring my fiancé to see some celebrities in person while not knowing much about the movie. I figured it would be a ""hard-to-understand"" foreign, indie film whose humor would be lost on a ""dumb American."" However, the truth was absolutely the opposite. My hard-to-please fiancé agreed.",2008
8,"One of the problems with seeing a trailer for a film is it creates an expectation. If it raises expectations, and the film delivers, great. However, if the film is less then expected, then the viewer feels cheated. The best case scenario is the one I found myself in before I saw In Bruges. Low expectations.",2008
8,"I think that I will shortly be purchasing the Oscar winning short film Six Shooter from 2004. I've got an iTunes gift card for just the job. The thought occurred to me after seeing the wonderful debut from director Martin McDonagh, In Bruges. After seeing the trailer, which really worked for me, many times and wondering at how it is from an Oscar winning director yet never hearing of the name, I did some research. While he already has more little gold men than Alfred Hitchcock, his actual feature premiere is what has opened this weekend. It is Irish, most definitely, and if you have trouble with the accent, maybe you should steer clear until in comes out on DVD, however, if you can cope, this is a smart pitch black comedy. When I say pitch black, I mean black hole expanse of darkness. The trailer leads you to believe it will be an uproarious time, and while it is very funny and very smart, there is a tragic event that is held over the proceedings, lending a somber shadow over all that occurs. In the end though, it is consistent with its wit and drama, telling an intriguing story and never relying on the laughs to hide any plot point that the creators may not have wanted to work out to completion.",2008
9,"Greetings again from the darkness. Award winning playwright Martin McDonagh brings his amazing writing talents to the big screen and scores with his first turn as a feature film director. The city of Bruges (yes, in Belgium) is the perfect setting for the multi-layered story. Its well preserved medieval architecture is like an character unto itself.",2008
10,"Well, to be honest I wasn't sure what to expect from this film, nor am I fan of Colin Farrell, in fact I really didn't like him at all previously....but now I have a new found respect for him and with Gleason and Fienes both in excellent form coupled with a very quick and witty script and some surprisingly violent scenes, this film really has something for everyone (except the young kids).",2008

10,"The films that I find myself thinking about afterwards are of two kinds - the best and the worst. In the case of the worst I am trying to work out just why they are so bad, in the case of the best, like In Bruges, the rare 10s, they make such an impact that I cannot get them out of my head. It was only later that I realised that Martin McDonagh has, apparently, lifted his basic situation - two hit men whiling away the time waiting for instructions as to their next victim - from Harold Pinter's early one-act stage play The Dumb Waiter. However The Dumb Waiter ends when the message (the same one as in In Bruges) arrives. McDonagh then extends the scenario in quite unexpected directions, the foundations of which have been meticulously laid, sometimes by a mere throwaway line or gesture, earlier in the film. The film is full of memorable moments - dialogue, incident or characterisation - that interweave to form an indelible impression.",2008

10,"First off, I'd like to mention that this IS a Black Comedy, it's meant to be funny in a morbid way. Also, this is not a movie that should be seen for those with a faint heart as is suggested by the 18A rating (in Canada at least, no idea for other countries).",2008

This movie is not predictable because every time you make an assumption you are wrong. The imagery, the filming, the philosophies they speak of everything about this movie is perfect. Even the couple of far fetched scenes work wonders and are part of its central fairy-tell in purgatory theme. I look forward to seeing what else the writer/director has plans on releasing, I hope he continues the brilliance he showcased here! No matter what state of mind you are in or how you sleep or don't, WATCH THIS FILM!!",2015
1,"In Bruges is so relentlessly, mind-bogglingly bad, it's a miracle anyone was stupid enough to put up money for this piece of crap. Not only does it take forever to get going, is it full of people doing completely unbelievable things, does it completely fail to capture the spirit of Bruges and its inhabitants (and believe me, there's plenty material there which can be parodied mercilessly if one is so inclined), but worst of all it doesn't even know what it wants to say. And it's pretentious, to boot. ",2008
1,"Atrocious film-making. Two morons, that by the end we're meant to find adorable, arrive in Bruges for some sinister mission. What follows is basically a hate filled diatribe humiliating gay men (shock horror), dwarfs and women. There's no sophistication in the supposedly brilliant writing. It's the kind of lousy movie that seems to have been inspired by rednecks and writing on toilet walls in pubs.",2009

10,"I first saw the dark comedy-thriller IN BRUGES (IB) in our local multiplex back in April 2008, and I loved it immediately. No wonder writer/director Martin McDonagh's screenplay went on to be nominated for an Oscar, and co-star Colin Farrell won a Golden Globe award for Best Actor in a Comedy/Musical! When McDonagh's short film SIX SHOOTER, starring Brendan Gleeson, won the 2005 Oscar for Best Live Action Short Film, I was already familiar with his plays (including the 2005 Broadway hit THE PILLOWMAN with our family's household fave Jeff Goldblum), so I looked forward to seeing Gleeson work with McDonagh again in IB. I wasn't disappointed. McDonagh's quirky, funny, soul-searching dialogue is a joy to hear. It's chock full of profanity, but the delivery renders it more comical than offensive. The filmmakers even spoof the ""adult language"" in one of the DVD's bonus features, a montage of every time the word ""F***"" is used in IB.",2011

The internal ""moral"" conflicts of professional assassins weren't amusing in any way or intelligently presented. This subject matter would have any movie director walking on very thin ice. In order to pull it off, the director must display tact, the writer must provide smart dialogue and strong character development; and the actors should skate gracefully. None of those qualities are to be found here.",2012

10,"Rest assured, Iron Man is an absolutely amazing movie. I won't dare spoil any of this remarkable movie for you but I do recommend it as highly as I possibly can. Marvel needed to get in to the solo movie making business long ago. Instead of leasing out their characters to other studios, they're making movies themselves. Most everyone knows Iron Man is their first effort and what a great lead off film! This movie helps take the comic book genre to the highest level. Just like they did in the books, they reinvent standard epic adventure by ""Marvelizing"" characters and making them more believable. The Spider-Man and the X-Men movies did this to a degree but only as far as their respective studios wished to stay true to the source material. Anything added or amended was for the benefit of the live action adaptation. Director Sam Raimi pulled this off by talking to the summer crowd, not down to them with the Spider-Man series. Jon Favreau has done the same thing here but I think he's done it even better. Raimi intentionally threw in a little cheese. Favreau adds nice bits of humor but not too much. He also grounds the action and the suit of armor in firm reality. I've said it before but it's brave to reach for the highest common denominator with a big budget film and Favreau delivers a movie with as much feeling as it has action and intensity. Needless to say, Robert Downey Jr. and company deliver the goods. It's a movie that has a wonderful balance that delivers intelligence with its fun.",2008
8,So the world premier of Iron man to regular movie going audiences happened to be here in Seoul Korea on an army installation. I got to check it out and I was delightfully surprised.,2008

10,WOW WOW WOW.,2008
9,"Fortunately, I'm not one easily influenced by some users' negative comments. These people should try to restrain their bias opinions and try to review the movies as neutrally as possible.",2008
8,"There was a big question mark looming over the theatrical adaptation of Marvel's Iron Man property. It was in the guise of director Jon Favreau. Now, don't get me wrong, I love the Favs, but when I heard he was helming a big budget comic book flicklet's just say I was a little worried. Once his cast was set and the fanboys started humming across the internet I started to ease into the decision with high anticipation. Thankfully, after finally seeing the finished product, I was not disappointed in the least. With a great mix of the professionalism and stakes seen in both Spider-Man and X-Men and the comic wit and sheer fun of Fantastic Four, Iron Man shows how a comic can be brought to the screen successfully without all the added drama and weight. We finally have a film with the essence of what makes these picture books so popular, the action and mythology along with a sense of adventure and humor. Favreau never bogs us down with overwrought emotions nor speaks down to us with gags and poorly written jokes. Instead he delivers on his promises and gives us a solid initiation into what could be a great trilogy or more.",2008
8,"From the first moment Robert Downey Jr comes on screen as Tony Stark, you know that this movie can't go wrong. We are in some desert in Afghanistan and wisecracking Stark tells something about his playboy life to some soldiers. Yes, this ain't no nerdy Peter Parker or tortured Wolverine. Our hero is a person who generally enjoys life (and women) and has no second thoughts on how he lives it. Without any doubt, of all the superheroes that exist, Tony Stark is the coolest person there is! ",2008
8,"Iron Man, the huge kick off to the big summer blockbusters of summer 2008, a great start. I have to say that originally I had my concerns, when I saw the trailer, this movie looked way over done and Robert Downy, Jr. as the hero? The guy is a great actor, but as a super hero? I wasn't so sure, but I was able to see Iron Man today and all my doubts were put behind me as I watched. This is one of best comic book adaptations put to film in a very long time, since the original Spider Man I think. The effects were not actually too over the top, only when needed, but it gave that extra feel of a comic book. Robert Downy, Jr., I couldn't believe how well of a performance he pulled off, there still is a little question of his casting, but he pulled off Tony Stark seamlessly. This is a very entertaining action film and is such a great blockbuster that is sure to please any film buff.",2008
10,"With a little tinge of shame and regret, my rare dalliances with the Iron Man character stemmed from a few one off comic books, as well as occasions during the teenage years of spending time in the arcade with those Marvel games, where Iron Man was one of my preferred characters because it came together with his incredible arsenal of weapons from repulsor beams to this gigantic cannon which accompanied the execution of some complex combo moves. There's something sexy about the red and gold suit of armour, and having an array of weapons at the disposal of a player, makes perfect sense for variety in dispatching your enemies.",2008
9,"When it comes to ranking the Marvel superhero(live action) films, Iron Man is for me up there with the better ones. It looks fabulous, the whole film is very slickly made with top-notch special effects(which look like time and effort was really put into it), awesome-looking futuristic gadgets and Iron Man's suit will be a guaranteed delight to anybody who is familiar or loves anything to do with the superhero. There is a pulsating soundtrack that adds much to the tension of the first half of the story and the enormously fun action sequences, which are exciting and tense with expertly choreography. The script crackles with smart humour that doesn't go overload, all of which is laugh-out-loud funny, yet the hostage plotting that takes up the first part of the film is intelligently written and somehow avoids being over-serious or over-familiar. The story has enough to allow you to emotionally connect with Iron Man(who I've always considered one of Marvel's most interesting and multi-faceted characters) and has a clever mix of the comic's 1960s origins and the effects of contemporary war, which will provide plenty of nostalgia while also feeling relevant. Jon Favreau does a great job directing, he never loses control of the story and he doesn't do anything too fussy. Robert Downey Jnr's performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man is a power-house and one of his best, doing much with the smart dialogue while making the emotional side of the characters wholly believable. Gwyneth Paltrow is a good, loyal side-kick with wise-cracks that don't come across as annoying and Jeff Bridges is surprisingly very good in an against-type role. Personally, the only disappointments were the useless character of Christine Everheart and the somewhat rushed and over-blown finale that wasn't quite as thrilling as it could have been, other than that Iron Man was a classy addition to the Marvel cannon and a great film on its own. 9/10 Bethany Cox",2014
10,"This was a great movie. I am a huge Downey fan, but was really unsure about him playing a super hero especially a guy in his 40's. I can say that because I'm right there with him. He was amazing. I normally don't like these kinds of movies and wouldn't have gone to it if I hadn't known someone who was an extra, but I am so glad I did. Jeff Bridges was so good, I'm having a hard time with him being bald, but it was a good move. My only complaint, was Gwyenth Paltrow. She was horrible, it was like she was really trying to play the part, she half-you know. But other than that it was great. Special effects, whoa.",2008

After reading a few comments by those persuaded of this being nothing short than the second coming of Christ, I stumbled on a reviewer that praised the movie for its limited use of CGI. Limited? Sure and I assume last summer's Transformers was shot with full scale models animated via stop motion! Anyways let's skip to the review.",2008
9,"Quite possibly the best comic movie ever, hovering around the level of the first Spider-Man (before Raimi lost his mind). Robert Downey Jr was as perfect a casting job as we've been expecting, Bridges plays Obidiah Stane that you won't even think of him as The Dude, the CG doesn't suck,and it doesn't try to cram too much...(read more) in (the runtime of just over two hours feels just right). Any worries I had about this film went right out the window, and they'll stay out the window when I go again... and again... and again. Just remember to stick through the credits, because if you know anything about Marvel (and even if you don't) you'll find the wait worth it.",2008

10,"Iron Man is one of the better superhero movies. It's based off the popular Marvel comics. On one of the reviews, I was shocked to see that the person liked the new Hulk better. I agree that Hulk is a great movie, but Iron Man is 100 times better. Tony Stark, a popular weapons company owner gets kidnapped by a cult called ""Ten Rings"" in the Middle East. They want Stark to build a weapon for them. Instead he builds his Iron Man suit. He eventually escapes and later becomes Iron Man. Will he have revenge on the cult and it's surprising leader? You'll have to watch to find out. The acting is better than expected in this film. Robert Downey Jr. did such a unexpected great job. Gwyneth Paltrow did well as her role of Pepper Potts. I also liked Terrence Howard as Rhodey. The special effects were great as they are with superhero movies. The plot has its share of intriguing twists. I believe that this Iron Man is original, but that is my opinion. I rate this movie 10/10.",2008

9,"I gotta admit, like most other people I was not a big fan of Iron Man comics or Robert Downey Jr, but after seeing this movie I have new respect for the actor and the character. With his drug/alcohol problems of the past it seemed like Downey would be the perfect guy to portray someone who went through a similar experience and cleaned up his act. Now with Spider-Man being Marvel's mascot, I was very surprised that they made me want to see more of a character that wasn't exactly a house hold name. Big congrats to Favreau & co. for pulling this off. So which makes me wonder how incredible major properties such as Fantastic Four, Hulk & Captain America could have been with the right people on the projects. This movie was so good it's hard to even watch earlier superhero films because they will not be at the level this one is. The actors, especially Downey did a fantastic job and were believable in their roles. As Stark, he perfectly captured the self serving smart ass as well as the guy who redeems himself by using his weapons for good. The story & CGI were amazing especially the origin sequence & the unveiling of the final version of the Iron Man suit. Only gripe is that maybe there could have been more action or a more major villain from the comics, but hey they're just getting started. I am definitely looking forward to the sequel and hope the same quality continues for this new franchise.",2008

I went into the theater with an open mind, not expecting brilliance, but expecting to be entertained. Well, I guess I was technically entertained since I laughed throughout most of the movie. Sadly, I wasn't laughing at purposely funny moments. I was laughing at the awkward ""acting"" of the actors and the terrible dialogue.",2008
1,"I could tell from the trailer this movie was trash, but out of curiosity and boredom/insomnia i gave it a download (would never pay a penny to watch this). I couldn't even make it halfway through without turning it off. The storytelling was like reading a children's book: everything told in linear fashion, and then spelled out with ""flashcards"" two seconds later in case anyone was still too dense to understand (e.g. say wolf, then show a picture of a wolf on the screen...show a book she wants, then two scenes later show her in the library...gee, thanks, i wouldn't have understood without the spoon-feeding). I think this movie was meant for 12 year olds or people of very low intelligence. They should show movies like this to film students and do play by plays, ""OK, here's how NOT to shoot a scene/edit a movie...."" How do studios actually give people with no talent money to make crap movies like this??? Do yourself a favor: Go see ""Let The Right One In"" instead. That is, if you have an IQ over 80.",2009

1,"I've never wanted to walk out of a movie so badly. I think you should give the film a chance to develop fully before forming an opinion. This was certainly not a ""film"" with any substance. The acting was horrible, the script was horrible, the whole thing was rushed and insubstantial. For being such a predicted box office hit, given the already large fan base, the budget must have been dismal. I think you would need to be no older than 10 to enjoy this film, but the kissing scene in Bella's bedroom was too passionate for a kid's movie (Bella's in her panties!?). In the books it takes them a long time to move forward with their physical relationship. The story was clearly written with teens in mind but still enjoyable for adults. The movie was a cringer.",2008

And the vampire's skin turns glittery in sunlight? Is this a vampire film or My Pretty Pony? Stupid and a total bore. I apologize to all of the people who love this film, I think that a lot of the fans of the picture are also fans of the book series, which warrants the sequels.

OK, so how I saw the movie, my sister, ironically my older sister has been just raving about the Twilight series with her friends and told me that I have to read these books, after weeks of bugging me with it, I finally broke down and read them. Actually it's kind of a fun series, it reminded me of the same love that I had for the TV series Buffy the vampire Slayer when I was a young teen.

They are supposed to be I-can't-live-without-you, take-me-forever, I'm-devoted-to-you-always in love (Unless you want to count that one incident in Eclipse, but let's face it, most of us don't) but all I saw was a bored vampire and an indifferent girl.",2008

1,"Never before have I been tempted to rip off my face and throw it at the TV screen just so I didn't have to watch anymore. Not only was this THE worst Vampire film I have ever seen, but it was also one of the worst films ever. It is quite clearly Vampires for Disney, or rather Vampires for barely pubescent girls. I am actually getting really angry just writing this, for a start forget all the well known Vampire folklore, that goes right out the window. They can walk about in sunlight, crucifixes do nothing, they don't have fangs and they never sleep. They can however run very quickly and also fly without wings. If all that doesn't put you off they don't even kill humans, they just ponce about looking like a load of pasty-faced EMO's (another group the film is clearly aimed at) keeping themselves to themselves. and that is it. for the first hour and a half! then some proper Vampires turn up and they run away, then fight, then run some more, then fight the end. The love story is absolutely pathetic, she's new in town sits next to him in class he seethes, he walks out. she doesn't see him for three weeks, he apologises, saves her from a crash and wham bam they're in love? It's mental. I don't care how hormonal she is. The way she figures out he's a Vampire is so laughable I suggest you watch it on you tube, obviously don't watch the whole film or you may end up dead from boredom, just that scene. Please please please don't watch this awful abomination of a film. Watch The Lost Boys instead.",2009

1,"************SPOILER****** O.K. people, I will admit right here, right now, I simply LOVED the books. I have read them all several times and I was genuinely excited at the prospect of MY book coming to life on the big screen. I went to the movie theater with my die hard Twilight friends, expecting to be amazed. Well, I was amazed all right. But definitely not in a good way. The scene starts out with Bella( Kristen Stewart) leaving for the airport with her mother. For some strange reason, her carry on item is a potted cactus plant. The scene them melts into a birds eye view of the beautiful Washington mountains(helped along by whinny, annoying, indie rock music). As Bella comes to terms with her new life(narrated by the mannish voiced Stewart), Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner, wearing a dead ferret on his head) arrives with his father and their old, Bella's new, truck. The only thing they got right in this scene was the truck for crying out loud! In the book, Charlie(Billy Burke) is not on speaking terms with Billy because of his prejudicial dislike for the Cullen clan; however, in the movie, the two men joke and laugh and have a grand old time. Meanwhile, Bella and Jacob make forced conversation, never quite looking at each other(even though in the book, they don't meet until very much later). Stewart's forced smiles, bad acting, and foul mood completely ruin the scene. We then move on to the 'first sight' of the Cullen clan. I shouldn't even comment. The characters come in-slow motion of course-in pairs, each arm and arm with his/her own lover. Lets start with Rosalie(Nikki Reed). Reed is short(Reed wore awkward, six- inch heels she couldn't even walk in), very tan(can you say, pasty make- up?), with brown hair(Reed was unwilling to dye it, so she wore an ill fitting wig), moles, and an all around ugly face. The choice for her role was made solely because of the director's relationship with Reed. The real Rosalie-as stated in the book-is tall, statuesque, with golden blond hair, very pale, and beautiful-all in all, the complete opposite of Reed. I honestly like the choice for Emmett, except I wished Kellan Lutz beefed up a bit more. Alice was too tall, but otherwise I had no problem with Ashley Greene(she could have lost a little weight though- just saying). Now, Jackson Rathbone as Jasper would have been fine, if the guy could act. He took the phrase 'hungry enough to eat a horse' way too literally. He had a pinched, grotesque look on his face for the whole of the movie. Finally, ah, Edward, how will I begin? Well, Robert Pattinson looked the part, if not a little too skinny, but oh, ah, ugh, the make-up! What on earth were these people thinking? You could tell he was wearing a gallon of make-up, but they ran out of it when the reached his Adam's Apple. Edward also, apparently, loves the new strawberry Cover Girl wet slicks lip gloss. Now, onto the biology lab. What to say, what to say. Well I recommend, Vampires Suck. The people there displayed Pattinson's reaction to Bella's scent perfectly. In the book, it merely states that Edward goes rigid in his seat, glaring at Bella with hate filled eyes as she walked past him. Past him. Not Bella walking in front of a fan-slow motion, once again- with her mouth opened suggestively. And Edward DID NOT slap his hand to his face, hiding his nose from someone who farted near by. And I don't remember Edward trying not to cry in the book either(his 'I'm trying really hard not to cry' face reappeared throughout the movie). Well, I am bored now, so I wont bore anyone else with the rest of my review for the most terrible, poorly written, directed,acted, etc, movie in a decade. The indie film feel with Stewart grabbing at her hair, jutting her chin out, shaking her head(you'd think she was a dog), and stuttering makes you want to stalk out of the theater to go shriek at the manager for your money back. Stewart and Pattinson's chemistry is non-existent in this poorly adapted, haphazardly written, laughably acted atrocity of a film.",2011

First of all the actors are horrible; Kristen Stewart is always stuttering and gasping for air and Robert is extremely ugly, has horrible acting and seriously needs to work on his accent. And second, there are so many questions: ",2010
1,"It would be good if it were a spoof but that's the only good thing I can take away from it. It's unbearable to watch this girl Kristen Stewart try to act and Robert Pattinson isn't all that much better. Stewart does this absurd stuttering that I know has nothing to do with the character because every interview of her displays the same boring characteristic. Therefore, she is not an actress, not in any way. She's only playing herself and she has no charisma to begin with.",2010
9,"Having neither read the books nor seen the original television movies, I come to the series with unbiased (if ignorant) eyes. My wife and I, who lived briefly in Toronto, are both charmed by Murdoch and his slightly daft colleagues. ""Charmed"" is the word, for we find the actors, scripts, clothing, details and the City of Toronto itself charming. The bigotry faced by a Catholic detective in the city of the Family Compact rings very true as does Murdoch's gentle piety, a refreshing change in today's detective shows. It is a bit mystery, a bit soap opera, a bit character study and a lot of fun. We, at least, have been captivated by William Murdoch as portrayed by Yannick Bisson, a character who is a genuinely honest, gentle and quiet man of strength facing ethical, moral, professional and legal challenges in each episode. George Crabtree and the Inspector become more interesting as time goes on. The corruption of Toronto and Ontario politics hides behind several episodes while the turn of the 20th century fascination with science and ""the coming thing"", as Brisco County Junior would say, gives some lightness to the whole thing. In the final analysis it is the interplay of characters, centred on the troubled but charming Murdoch himself, that elevates the Murdoch Mysteries to the level of Midsomer, Taggert or Poirot. A fine series and not only for Canadians.",2010
10,There are so few shows that I thoroughly enjoy. Murchoch Mysteries is one of 4 particular shows that I watch regularly - and tape so that I do not miss them.,2012
10,"Great Canadian show. Simple, yet top notch with a Canadian like atmosphere.Very realistic for the times. History is great. The clothing designs and artifacts is exceptional. It seems the times were simple back then. Well written with a touch of humour. The cast are all excellent. You can tell they all get along really well. The show reminds me of Sherlock Holmes and yet it also reminds me of Sue Thomas FB Eye and Due South which by the way it sure was nice to see Paul Gross (from Due South) appear in an episode as his brother, although not sure what episode it was. We didn't see his name on the cast list as a guest star. The guest appearances are outstanding and it sure is nice to see some familiar faces. We love and watch all the episodes. With each season the character story lines change as in the case of Helen Joy, Yannick Bisson which is excellent leaving us more curious with what will happen next. That is one of the reasons we like the show. Now that the show is in it's fourth year the plot lines are continually changing which goes to prove that Murdoch Mysteries is a true success. Keep up the excellent work.",2012
10,"I'm been watching mysteries for many years and never have enjoyed a series more than Murdoch Mysteries. The time period, set design and writing matches the great performances by the cast, who you can't help but appreciate. If ever a series deserved a wider audience and advertising, it is this one. The unfulfilled love affair between Doctor Ogden and Murdoch is so well written and performed perfectly by Helene Joy and Yannick Bisson. Also, top notch acting by Jonny Harris in his portrayal of Constable Crabtree gives just the prefect comic relief while Murdoch solves the case using every scientific method available. Thomas Craig is also marvelous as the cranky Inspector Brackenreid. I can't help wondering why this show does not have a larger audience base since it is the talk of so many people I know, both at work and socially. My wife and I eagerly await each and every episode. Please make many many more!",2010
10,"'Murdoch Mysteries' stars Yannick Bisson as Inspector William Murdoch who solves crimes in 1890's Toronto, is an exceptionally well made and acted series, which makes a nice change from CSI/NCIS etc. staple of whiz-bang, FX laden crime shows",2010
8,"I caught 'The Murdoch Mysteries' by accident while drifting around the satellite channels and was instantly hooked. A well performed, touching and interesting show caught my eye. The characters are involving, are worth caring about and have a strong sense of purpose. Each one brings something to the mix and adds their own skills to the events of each episode. Each episode has a strong mystery to be solved, sometimes offering an intriguing moral dilemma to both Murdoch and the viewer. It is also very reassuring to not have modern day morality thrust into the past as happens so frequently with other shows (yes 'Dr Quinn Medicine Woman', I mean you), dealing with the nineteenth century. Instead we are allowed to explore the world as they see it, enjoying the discoveries and trying to find a way forward into a new century. Well done to all concerned and long may it continue.",2010
10,"The Murdoch Mysteries is like; The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, with Jeremy Brett meets CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. ",2008
10,"The inevitable comparisons are going to take place between these two actors, Peter Outerbridge and Yannick Bisson. Their interpretation of the material is different for one very important reason, the movies of the week were based on novels, the series is based on the characters with the exception of one episode which is an adaptation of Let Loose The Dogs. My feeling is that you should not rush to judgement or make comparisons until you are able to see the entire series of episodes and witness how the characters unfold. The series is excellent and I would urge viewers to form an opinion after viewing a number of the episodes and see how the actors nuance their characters as well as the different textures that are shown from story to story, episode to episode.",2008
10,"A friend got me into this show via the DVD route. I will be eternally grateful. The whodunit components are excellent, but the characterizations are way beyond that. I find myself applauding at the end of every episode. The humor is top notch and totally in character. To me this show belongs right up there with Foyle's War and Inspector Morse. I realize that this is a tremendous accolade but Murdoch Mysteries deserves it. I have just finished seeing all of seasons 1 and 2 so I can hardly wait for season 3. By the way, I still think William should have stuck with Enid and Elwin, but that's just me. The last episode of season 2 where William meets his half brother was an absolute delight. Sorry about that spoiler.",2012
10,"I have been watching Murdoch Mysteries since the first season and it just keeps getting better and better. I discovered it on my own and eventually my husband started watching it too. Now, it is something we watch as a family! My 14 and 10 year old sons are hooked too! There are many reasons why I love this show so much - it has so many great elements in it - humour, drama, mystery, romance....the writing/story lines are so creative and clever. I love how they tie in real historic figures into the program like Alexander Graham Bell, Harry Houdini and Henry Ford. The cast is incredibly talented. The 19th century period costumes are beautiful. This is a true Canadian gem of a program which every household should be watching!",2012
10,"Yannick Bisson is a fine actor and does a Excellent job as Murdoch. I'm sure that Peter did a good job with the movies but TV shows are different. And if you read Maureen Jennings site you find out that she likes Yannick Bisson as Murdoch in the TV show as well as Peter in the movies. I know that some people can be fans of a certain actor and they are loyal to that actor so that might cloud there judgment.So a TV show can be good and the new actor playing the part very good but if someone is loyal to the other actor they may have a clouded judgment on the show. If you watch the TV show you will fine that it is wonderful show and that Yannick Bisson is a fine actor and does a great job as Murdoch. I also trust Maureen Jennings since she wrote the books and she is pleased with Mr. Bisson and the TV show. All you have to do is watch the TV show and you find out for yourself that its a great show, and Yannick is a great Murdoch. So watch and find out for yourself.",2008
1,"The ratings and reviews would lead one to believe that ""Murdoch Mysteries"" was among the finest series on television today. I have watched several episodes from different seasons, trying to find some redeeming features and have come to the conclusion that either there is an active campaign to artificially boost the ratings of this poor production or this series suggests a backlash against the complex, highly sophisticated, high production value television available elsewhere. Whatever the reason, ""Murdoch Mysteries"" is shockingly under par in writing, acting, and production values, especially glaring in this new ""golden age"" of television. At it's best ""Murdoch Mysteries"" is blandly charming in it's local dinner theater quality. One can sit through an episode or two while visiting one's aging parents easily enough. Written and produced to be easily grasped the average 10 year old, this is probably ideally suited for families looking for something safe to watch with pre-teens. But please, let's save the 10/10 ratings for series that truly deserve it. This is a 6/10 series at best and there is nothing wrong with that.",2016
10,"In agreement with most of the top responders, I find this Toronto-based detective series at the very TOP of my retirement 'Bucket-list viewing.' Most of the accolades have already been spent, but I'll add a few viewer-stars to the creator, cast, crew, directors, editors - and to Chris Robinson, music supervisor - only shy of Superior. Even my wife, just home from work and jumping into her nightie with Wednesday's microwaved leftovers on her lap, 'can't wait' for the next episode. You are remiss in your choices if you neglect-to-select these excellently-created and modernly-portrayed Canadian thespian experiences. Our Kudos. We watch on Netflix live-streaming, bereft of commercials, with confidence the series will continue there.",2013

3,"I love detective mysteries, and in particular I enjoy ones set in the Victorian era, so I admit with reluctance that Murdoch Mysteries almost makes me want to swear off both era and genre altogether. Almost. The main character is inarguably the smartest, most effective policeman in his station (regardless of how utterly cliché and guessable a great deal of the ""mysteries"" are), and yet he simply allows himself to be berated by his hot-headed, moronic boss and every other plot-device naysayer the writers can't seem to do without. This makes every episode's story flow painfully stuttered for no good reason, and also introduces a lot of aggravating, stereotypical suspects. The ""idiot-driven plot"" is par for the course with this show, sometimes getting so bad it becomes not so much a mystery as a game of monkey-in-the-middle, wherein the detective struggles to wrap up the case simply because everyone around him is obtusely and purposelessly unhelpful. CSI Miami's Horatio Caine would never stand for such hem-hawing idiocy, and Sherlock Holmes would deftly manipulate his way past them. John Murdoch simply looks politely perplexed and does nothing, which means we can only suffer in silence as it happens again and again. In addition to the clichés, generic plots, meek main character, and moronic background characters, we are also subject to never- ending soapboxing, and by insultingly anachronistic philosophies of the progressive persuasion. A good writer MAY be able to weave modern social issues into historical fiction in an intelligent, thoughtful way. The writers of this show approach such touchy material with the grace, talent and intelligence of a lobotomized democratic hippo on rollerskates in a China shop. Each subject is dealt with in such a crass, illogical, ham-fisted way, it makes me sincerely embarrassed for progressives. People back then simply did not speak or think the way they do in this show. Hell, I hardly see it now! It's insultingly dishonest, and I sincerely doubt it will change anyone's mindset. On top of that it makes for annoying, patronizing television. So there you have it: a nice premise, some nice characters, some nice costumes, some fun plots, idiotic writing, adequate-at-best acting, clichés galore, insufferable preachiness, often poor pacing, and a deficient level of suspense. Watch if you're bored.",2015
1,"The only thing in greater excess than the show's terrible acting is Yannick Bisson's eyeliner. I honestly have little less to say about this ""show"", its tedious pace or its incessant dramatics pauses, but I am disallowed from posting a review shorter than 10 lines. Seeing almost exclusively positive reviews for this truly dreadful ""show"" was an affront I could not abide. I will assume that many like minded persons had better things to do than tack on additional text to their would be negative reviews and therefore did not bother posting at all. The misrepresentation expressed in those positive reviews of this, one of television's worst attempts at storytelling, and the use the word attempts loosely, is almost as offensive as the show itself.",2013
10,"A wonderful Victorian era show that highlights many of the issues they had at the time, though some reviews I see do not understand this. It goes without saying that the show is not for everyone, I appreciates history, even when it is lightly played with inventions and such as Murdock does. This is a show that highlights Canadian values and has some deep underlying moral questions that will tug at your mind. You may not agree with all of the politics and religion that a few shows have but they are true to the time. I only wished people had the same decency that many of these characters have as it appears in this century we have lost many of those values.",2017
9,"One should never compare the actors of a movie to those portraying them on the small screen. For example, think back to ""The Odd Couple"". While Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon were phenomenal in the portrayal of Oscar and Felix, can you actually say that Tony Randall and Jack Klugmen were sub-par in their roles? Or, what about M*A*S*H? Donald Sutherland and Elliot Gould brought the characters to life, but Alan Alda and Wayne Rogers made them a household name!! I agree with Mr. Ford's comment. One should not judge a series by the first episode, for you may very well miss out a wonderful show! I, too, have read the novels by Ms Jennings and loved them. She has a wonderful knack of transporting you back in time. While you say that the precinct was too posh, and the clothes of the main character not shabby enough only says to me that you are not looking at the big picture and possibly missing what could be a hit show! So, watch a few more episodes; delve into the characters of Murdoch, Ogden and Brackenried and then give us your opinion. What would it hurt? What would you miss on television but a boring reality show?",2008
9,"We stumbled across this at our local DVD shop and got the first season - the shows have grown on us and love the gentle stories and use of 'new' technologies! The show is very different to the 'blood and guts' crime stories. The relationship between Murdoch and all the other main characters is delightful to watch and the innocent romance between Dr Ogden and Murdoch is 'sweet'!!!!!!!!!!! The humour produced with Crabtree, and others, bring joy to the episodes - especially the 'aliens from Mars' episode! Arthur Conan Doyle's appearance in a couple of episodes depicted him very well - so much so we 'googled' him and found the actor strongly resembled him - great casting! We will actively search for later episodes/seasons!",2011
10,"I discovered ""The Artful Detective"" (it's American name) only a few days ago, and was utterly charmed by it. I actually watched my first episode while channel surfing, so I got into it in the middle of the action, but it was so well written and immediately engrossing, it was incredibly simple to follow the action. With the plethora of murder mystery/detective shows flooding the market nowadays, it's refreshing to find such a gem of a show buried within all of the rest. The superb ensemble acting, the attention to period detail, and utter relevance to modern day crime fighting is fantastic, a major success in itself. But what really makes a great story is great writing, and this modern day masterpiece has it in profusion. What is absolutely wonderful about it is how it is able to remain incredibly intelligent, but stay so fun and easy to watch. After watching only the first episode, I was besotted, an instant fan! This may sound strange for a murder mystery, but this show is utterly... charming. PLEASE continue to produce and air this amazing, thoroughly entertaining television show.",2014
10,"I found this program on Netflix and started watching, I love love this show my only wish is that there were more to watch or that i could get the show here in the USA. I really enjoy this program and when I am watching it makes you feel that you are apart of it. I love the inspector as well and the love plot between the detective and the cor nor oh my. just makes you wish that you were there in that time and place. the police constable he is so eager to learn from Murdoch he plays the role well. i can't wait for my DVD to arrive so i can watch them over and over again and i hope that someday we can have the pleasure of watching it here in the USA too.",2014
10,When you get bored with everything else that is currently on television and you need a guaranteed hour of sheer entertainment that can whisk you away to a simpler time when the world was not as chaotic and confusing as it is now than may I suggest getting hooked on the CBC's (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) television series Murdoch Mysteries which is now entering their ninth season of continued success.,2015
10,"I had started watching Fringe when it aired in my country, and at first, I didn't really find it particularly interesting. However, I decided to persevere with it, and I'm very glad I did. This show is not perfect, but it's definitely not as bad as all these reviews tend to make out. With each episode (so far), I find myself more deeply immersed in the plot, more involved with the characters, and I can't wait until the next one airs. A lot of these other reviews say it's worse than 'Lost' - which isn't true. I tried watching Lost, for the entire first season, but I found myself completely bored, with no real plot line to follow. The opposite is true with Fringe. Each episode has two plots - One, the overall plot of the series, and two, the plot of the individual episode, such as the investigation. This is common practice, but Fringe makes it.. fresher.",2009

10,"Been watching the reviews for the show for some time now and I have to say that most people are confused. Confused on how a series is reviewed. When we speak about a sitcom comedy, by just watching one or two episodes it is fairly easy to judge the quality. But when trying to analyze a series like X-Files, Lost, Fringe and so many other, one has to watch the whole bunch of arc episodes in order to have an objective opinion. yes the science portrayed every week may be a little too much but... X-Files (which I also loved) was about aliens.... So....we believe in aliens but cannot comprehend that there may be science beyond our imagination???? As for the characters, and especially for Anna Torv.......her acting (the way see looks in the first episodes - like cold and aloof) it's just the way things should be in the beginning......then she is a cold-hearted FBI agent and that is what she shows us.......everyone who cared enough to watch all the episodes till now will see how she has changed as a character (and how well acted that character is by Anna Torv - I had never seen her before). Most of the reviews here are based on the first 3 or 4 episodes.....well.....it's a whole story that has to be said.....go through the first season and see then what your reactions will be... Yet the series is not without problems, but it will get better and better. Most of the arc episodes are thrilling and most of the rest episodes are full of mad science (got to love it). The production values are sky-high...",2010
9,"When I first saw Fringe, I was immediately reminded of firstly The 4400 and secondly the X-files. Each show is similar in that supernatural incidents occur, and that only a specialized task force is capable of dealing with them. In the x-files we mostly followed the story of agents Skully and Mulder and their investigation in cases that revolved around aliens, religion and metaphysics. In 4400 it were agents Skouris and Baldwin who investigated incidents relating a group of ""special"" people. In Fringe, it's all about science. An investigation team researches cases where high tech inventions that border on the supernatural are being used to commit crimes, show off, or even unexplained purposes. While some cases seem to be uncomfortably similar to what we already experience in daily life, other cases are more fantastical.",2009
8,"This is a great show with talented actors and great storyline. You have to see every episode to know whats going on. Nothing for viewers who watches a episode every other week. The people who calls the storyline bad doesn't get it. It's very smart and like ""Lost"" you have to use your mind to find out the secrets revealed throughout the show. JJ Abrams is a brilliant writer and the cast is perfect. I strongly recommend you who haven't seen this show to have a look. -FROM THE BEGINNING- otherwise you will not understand a thing.",2009
9,"I first started following the series at launch, viewing the first 3 episodes. Then i completely forgot about it. I just recently started viewing this again and i have to say, there's more to it than the first couple of episodes let you see. The plot deepens as episodes go by, the role of the ""mad scientist"" becomes clearer and everything slowly ties in together like a perfect puzzle. The story is not one of the most original you'll find, but it is told in a most beautiful way, a way that will keep you hooked until the end. The characters are strong and so are the actors/actresses that bring them to life. The effects are top notch. An overall great TV show with that classical X Files feel to it but with a twist, a twist that i personally enjoy and one that made me anxiously await the second installment in the TV series. Highly recommended to all you X Files fans and also for anyone that enjoys a conspiracy plot that has some substance. An easy 9 out of 10.",2009
10,"I watch this show every week. If I can't be home I make sure it is DVR'd. I love the character Walter Bishop (John Noble). He is my favorite part of the show. I mainly watch it for him. I too didn't like it much in the beginning but then I got to know the characters and now I am addicted. It's the type of show that can keep you interested because every week it is something new but still with the ongoing storyline. (make sense?)I like all the characters and I have to disagree with other reviewers who say that these people can't act. Joshua is a very good and talented actor, he was on another hit TV show for many years (Dawson's Creek), so he's got to be doing something right. As for Anna Torv I think she is a good actress, I think that her storyline and character is why people think she is a bad actor. I don't like all the reality stuff on TV these days. I like being taken somewhere else and leaving reality behind for an hour a week. I have enough reality with my job and life and they are just coming up with dumb and dumber shows all the time. This show is good entertainment, which is what TV is suppose to be.",2009
10,"Just finished the show, and wiping the tears, and I have got to say that this IS one of THE BEST shows of all-time. AND you don't have to be a sci-fi fan to appreciate it. I am not a Trekkie or a Star Wars fanatic, but I do appreciate a good story, and this definitely has that. This show has it all; Adventure, Horror, Drama, Action, Comedy, Mystery, Fantasy, and Romance. I'm sad that it's ended, as with the recently finished Breaking Bad, but I know that there is so much more to be discovered. Give this show a chance and stick it out and you will be rewarded. ",2013
8,"OK first things first...... you people can't just watch the first two episodes and say that this show isn't good. the first few episodes of any show are bound to be a little slower than the latter. And how can you not dig the strange things that take place in this show. I think it is an excillent, fresh, new idea and has a lot of potential. It's kind of like CSI meets the x-files with some weird science in the mix. Overall i think this series has great potential if you saw the first two episodes and gave up on the show your an idiot. Myself being a huge fan of Lost was a little skeptical about Fringe and was even a little bit disappointed with the first few episodes. Keep watching and like me you will be pleasantly surprised!",2009
10,"I've noticed that most of the horrible reviews here are those that didn't get past the first four episodes. Granted, these were not the most exciting and well-written story lines presented to viewers, but afterwards, the ball really gets rolling.",2013
10,"I started watching the show just when the first season was heading towards its end, and frankly I was taken aback. It was the perfect show for me, a heavenly combination of drama, action, thrills, science, fiction and characters that you can so easily relate to. You don't even notice how fond you grow of them. I've stuck with the show until the very end, and yes, there are some twists here and there that could've been dealt differently but the show ha maintained it's quality. It's not easy to watch and it's definitely not that easy to keep track of all the cases or events that come to happening but the complex nature of the show is very unique. And in a way beautiful.",2013
9,"Yes the show has to grow, but they have done a terrific job on it. If anyone wants more insight into the show please go to youtube and look for the ComicCon footage. I am one of the lucky few who go to go to the Q&A for Fringe. They were an awesome group. As to the people who are saying it is a Rip off of X-Files get a life. X-Files was not even original, hello Kolchek, the Night Stalker. Even though it wasn't the FBI it was very much an early X-Files.",2009
10,"I first watched this show when it started airing on TV in the Netherlands. I instantly really liked it, watched it every week, until I lost track of it. A few years later, I came across some GIFs of the show and thought hey.. I know that show. That show is excellent. So I watched all of it, and then a third time with my boyfriend last year. Even after seeing it several times, it's still an excellent show. It's clever, the acting is great (gets better throughout the seasons), it has a very distinct science-theme, and after a while I found myself really becoming attached to the characters. I LOVE Anna Torv (who plays Olivia). She's a wonderful actress, and even when wearing a long, shapeless, black trench coat and hat she still somehow manages to be sexy. John Noble is of course brilliant as Walter, a character that provided me with a lot of chuckles and some very useful information (such as; eat eggs when you've been drinking, it sucks up some of the alcohol and makes you feel less drunk, and hungover the next day). ",2013
9,"I gotta say I didn't had too much hopes for this show on it's first two episodes, but while watching it every since until now, i can honestly say how mistaken i was. The second season particularly is very amusing and it caught me after every episode. You could say this is somehow the ""X Files"" young sister. Not to mention the special effects are really great and convincing (something sometimes really hard to find in a TV show). On what comes to the performances, Anna Torv could do a little better as the FBI Agent Oliva Dunham, but i believe her performance has even become more convincing during this second season as well. Joshua Jackson really surprised me with his smart yet stubborn Peter Bishop, when i realized ""hey, this guy can truly act"" i mean i was afraid it was gonna be some sort of older Pacey Witter (the role his always known for, from his previous TV show hit ""Dawson's Creek"") and i must say he proved me wrong, cause this role is nothing like it and, as an actress myself, i was really shocked by the way he putted the Pacey alter-ego aside to play this other role. On what comes to Walter Bishop and Agent Astrid Farsworth, i must say just how much i love them. They're this magnificent endearing duet, which is hard to find on Sci-Fi/drama TV series. John Noble is already known as a very versatile actor and i love the way he imagined this character was supposed to be and then again, they way he plays it. Jasika Nicole is, or at least her character, somebody i could be friends with that is, at the same time smart, and fits great on the Fringe Division team. I still have my doubts about characters like Nina Sharp and Agent Broyles, but still are part of an amazing cast.",2009
10,"To be honest my feelings about this show were very meh after watching the pilot episode. Technically well done with good production values, but the story seemed drawn out and derivative and the characters didn't really grab me, especially the female lead (played by Anna Torv). But there was enough there that was intriguing to make me watch another episode, then another, then another. It took a while to get going, but a little over halfway through Season 1 I realized I was becoming eager to view each successive episode. Yes, at first there were many similarities to other genre shows (after all, they all draw water from the same well) but by the end of Season 1, Fringe was successfully carving out its place among the greats. It really hit its stride in Season 2 which picked up the pace with some very skillful and effective writing. There were still some momentum shifts while toggling between episodic and serialized storytelling, but the characters had come into their own and the intensity increased significantly. And Season 3? Absolutely Blew. My. Mind. So much so that I'm really stoked to see how they're going to top it.",2011
5,"This had to be the most hyped show in recent memory. What a dud!!! The plot was slow and plodded along in the beginning. I tuned in with an open mind, but this show was so disappointing that I kept looking at the time remaining and hoped it would get better. To be fair there were a couple of scenes that I liked such as the LSD line and the Cow in the hall. However, the plot had some continuity holes and the writing just was not tight. If they expect this to keep and build a loyal following the writing and plot better start improving on the future episodes they have in the can or they will not make it to next season (imho). I did think John Noble's character was the best acted in the pilot he was the only one that was really believable. I guess playing crazies is his calling.",2008
1,"I've bent over backwards and given the show 3 weeks to suck me in. I can do bad TV as long as it's not too stupid, or the characters intrigue me. I've stuck with ""Prison Break,"" because of the characters, although I'm hanging on by a thread. I've stuck with ""24"" because it moves so fast and furiously and throws in so many curves I don't have time to suspend disbelief.",2008

1,"the most hyped show of the new season aired on FOX: ""Fringe"". Its pilot is the second most expensive TV pilot ever that cost $10 million (""Lost"" is first with well over $10 million).

8,"For anyone who thinks this is close to Psych...you're dead wrong. While both shows take a similar premise, they're so different in many ways. This show does have a man with the ability to spot minute details, but he does so much more, he plays mind games with people, reads their emotions and sets elaborate traps to catch them. Many compare him to Shawn Spencer of Psych, but I would rather compare him to Sherlock Holmes, except more tortured. The pilot obviously takes on a more serious approach than Psych and the dynamics of the show go from cute and funny to deeply disturbing in seconds.",2008
7,"The lead character Patrick Jane (Simon Baker) aka the 'Mentalist' plays a 'psychic' consultant for a serious crime unit headed by Lisbon (played Robin Tunney, ""Prison Break"") along with the rest of the cast, Cho (Tim Kang ""Rambo""), Van Pelt (Amanda Righetti, ""OC"") and Rigby (Owain Yeoman ""Nine""). But Patrick is no psychic, he relies upon acute observation and a penchant for playing mind games with the 'suspects' (and other members of the unit)to solve the case.",2008
9,I honestly say that the first I heard of this show I thought the premise was too simple and too recurrent. However I seem to find myself waiting impatiently for each week's episode and what is Patrick going to pull this time!,2009
8,"'The Mentalist' is the latest American crime drama to make its way to British shores and so far, it is proving itself to be a promising show which will hopefully continue to flourish. The show revolves around Patrick Jane, a mentalist (someone with a highly developed sense of observation who can give the illusion that they have psi abilities) with a haunted past, who uses his unique skills to help the California Bureau of Investigation solve crimes.",2009
10,"I really like the show and it's actors. It stars a man who had a career acting as a psychic who was just pretending for the money. He made the mistake of catching the attention of a serial killer who retaliated by killing his family. He recovered from a breakdown and now works as a consultant to help the bureau catch the ""bad guy"" by using those same intuitive, observant skills and really listening to what people do and don't say. Simon Baker plays quite a multifaceted character that goes from playful to serious, whichever is called for and does it very well. The Mentalist has a good blend of being neither too dark like Criminal Minds or too lightweight like Psych, shows which I also watch.",2009
9,"The mentalist is no doubt not an original concept, and yes, it might be somehow related to Psych. The show does distinguish itself from Psych with its new and unrelated material. The series literally takes you on a ride as one feels involved in the investigations with every episode. The haters of the show should ease up. This is good old detective work, which relies on careful crime scene observation and a bit of suspect manipulation, as oppose to the science ridden crime dramas which bombard our television sets every evening. No disrespect to C.S.I. One more thing that struck me, has anyone else noticed the number of 24 alumni appearing on the show?? Up until episode 7, we have had 4 alumni, Steve Culp, Xander Berkeley,Gregory Itzin and Leslie Hope. I wonder who is coming up next........ Catch the show for its wit and fun, if not.....check it out to see if Jack Bauer shows up to help The Mentalist.....",2008
8,"I am very interested in the sort of mental tricks that are shown on this show. Not that I want to be the guy, I'm more interested in why the human brain works the way it does, and so far the tricks he uses are well based in reality...as strange as they are.",2008
10,"I really enjoyed the pilot episode of this fast-paced show. The acting is very good; actually the lead actor, Simon Baker, is great. He is mesmerizing whenever he's in a scene. The premise is that Patrick Jane (Baker) is a former fake psychic whose family was murdered by a serial killer, Red Jack. Partically as atonement for having pretended to have psychic abilities, Jane is now on the side of the good guys. He is often called upon to help police solve crimes, not with any psychic abilities, but with his unusual and highly attuned powers of observation. The serial killer,Red Jack, is still on the loose several years later. In the pilot, another Red-Jack-like murder has just taken place. Only Jane realizes that the killer is a copycat and not the real Red Jack. Through his uncanny abilities and keen sense of observation and reading people, Jane is able to identify the real killer. The show has a great supporting cast and is smartly directed and shot. But the real pull and the big star is Simon Baker. He is simply great as the mentalist. He shows just the right amount of angst and humanity that has you pulling for him and feeling the pain and sorrow of his family's death, even though it occurred 5 years ago. He carries this show on his very capable shoulders.",2008
8,"Okay, first let's get this out of the way, shall we? I've already heard the naysayers griping about how this is a blatant rip-off of USA's series PSYCH. And you know what I think? I think that's an insult...to THE MENTALIST. I have seen at least one episode of PSYCH, and I have one question...WHY would you defend that show? It's horrible! I gave it one chance to impress me, especially since the episode I saw featured one of my favorite actors, Tim Curry, as a special guest star. I don't know who I was more embarrassed for - poor Tim for choosing to make that appearance, or for myself having to watch him slog through it.",2008
9,"Simon Baker surprised me with the lighthearted but guilt-ridden mentalist; I didn't like him so much in ""The Guardian"" (he seemed always in the wrong mood there), but I think he found the right tone here. Fantastic Robin Tunney as the tough but reasonable Teresa Lisbon; delicious Amanda Righetti as the unavoidable, contrasting naive believer Grace Van Pelt. I think she's a fair portrait of most believers in the paranormal: good hearted, well intentioned, but oblivious of the fraudulent techniques of the ""psychics"" and hoping to find ""the real deal"" some time. And willing to believe in transcendence. So close to so many people we all know.",2008
8,"""The Mentalist"" is very similar to ""Psych"" in that the lead character is trained to spot minute details, and through these observations he solves crimes. Where Shawn Spencer of ""Psych"" pretends to be a psychic private investigator while assisting the Santa Barbara police, Patrick Jane is a person who used to pretend to be a psychic (to achieve fame and wealth), but is now using his abilities as a private investigator to help the police. His motivation for assisting the police is made apparent in the pilot episode.",2008
5,"Having briefly perused some of the recent Mentalist reviews, I see it's been a long time since anyone posted any serious (or even coherent) comments about the show, so here goes.",2012
10,"If ever there was a show that could evoke such strong emotions, this is it. The Mentalist. Best show ever.",2015
10,"One of the most entertaining and pleasant to watch series I've seen. It is a wonderful illustration of how paying attention to events, as well as to people, can be an extremely powerful tool, and how most people are actually totally absent-minded compared to what they could be. Jane is brilliant as an ex-psychic who states that he was just pretending to have psychic powers, and who now uses mental acuity and mind tricks to get ahead of any situation and quickly expose liars and criminals in his own unique way, while having fun at it. The interactions between him and Lisbon are so fun. It's not necessarily about Jane's incredibly clever maneuvers being plausible or not. It's about the power of paying attention and understanding human behavior and emotions. Weather this can be done to this extent or not is not the point. The point is that in any field, there are some who are way better than most, and Jane is the best when it comes to figuring out deceit and camouflaged crimes.",2009
10,"I was bluffed by the scene when Jane kills Red Jhon.In 20 seconds or less S Baker does extraordinary work as an actor. I am glad the series gave him the fame he had been deserving for long.As an ex drama school trainee I love nothing more than a good performance and when an actor or actress makes it, it is a great joy. If I met him I would ask him how many takes where taken, I think very few , and what came to his mind at that moment (a mix of physical effort,determination, pain, hate, sadness, relief and remembrance,pride to have avenged his family that shows only in his sole eyes).Impressive.(I think he definitely was not thinking about his tax bill at that moment).Only one interviewer asked him but I would have liked a more elaborate answer as S Baker only answered he let the logic of the character carry him. But I do think there was more there.Pure acting gem! I had noticed Baker in The Guardian as he was excellent in the scenes with the father, and a few other movies since then (I am a big fan of his performance in Death and Sex). When a super talented actor becomes a star I'am so glad for him and his family.So many don't make it. All stars are not super talented actors but he definitely has a very clever, vivacious and deep way of impersonating characters with a great sense of humour when necessary.I really think he is in my top ten for those 20 seconds of perfect acting and the third Aussie along with Gibson &Blanchett in my list. Good he could catch the wave (of success) on this one. I like also the writing of ""The mentalist"" a storyline quality but also a brilliant lines' writing in very good pleasant English.Tops!",2015
10,"Simon Baker leads this transfixing show of murder as the character Patrick Jane. He's sassy, funny and always has an answer and that's the main reason I have stood by this show since the very start. along with his company of agents, Patrick Jane has successfully solved hard murders. Being the best thing that has ever happened to the California Bureau of Investigation, his frequent mind games help to solve many a murder",2014
8,"I don't imagine that Patricia Arquette is too pleased with this series! Her series titled Medium is basically the same premise as this show, but I found it to be aimed directly at women. Thats where the Mentalist shines because it is aimed at all demographics really. Not only that but the show is witty, funny, and mysterious all at the same time. Basically it is a bunch of episodes that each of murder investigations where the Mentalist comes in to predict who did it. There is also a main storyline with a murderer called Red John who murdered the protagonists family. The episodes with Red John in them are the best ones so far, and I think the viewers are looking forward to seeing the final showdown between Red John and the protagonist!",2009
9,"This is one of the few TV shows I HAVE to catch or I start having withdrawal symptoms. Someone said this is not original but not in a hostile way. I don't believe anything out there is original anymore, but The Mentalist is as close to being original as possible. It has more going for it than any other show I can think of.",2009
9,The Mentalist uses all the skills of some of the best Sleuths in history. He uses all the tools of Sherlock like deduction. Or Hercule Poirot's observation. and a dash of Ellery Queen's charm and inquisitive nature. What's original is the choice of an former con artist for the role. Changed into a crusader of justice by the death of his wife and daughter by a serial killer. Patrick Jane is such a breath of fresh air. The way he speaks his mind to the rich and powerful. Calling them jerks for the way they act. His bunt nature is similar to Dr. House with out that venom he spews. Its a great show without all of the gory murders of CSI or NCIS.,2009
9,A great show containing interesting and complex characters which are very well acted as well as a thrilling and exciting story which kept me obsessed through all seasons.,2015
8,"After reading some of the comments, I was surprised not to to see the most obvious in there: Lie to Me (starring Tim Roth) and Eleventh Hour (starring Rufus Sewell). Simon Baker's character has a lot in common with these two: The clear scientific eye, the sadness behind the charming smile, the way they could care less for protocol and police authority. Another thing is that the actors are all non-American; two Brits and one Aussie. These three shows are all good in their own way, and I have no problem with similarities. Medium and Psych are both decent shows, but I don't think The Mentalist should be lumped in with them. As far as I'm concerned, you can play as many variations on a theme as you like, as long as they are good!",2009
10,"Its all bout Patrick Jane who was a psychic in his former career.....A madman also a serial killer named RED JOHN killed his wife and daughter......This made Patrick's life miserable....Patrick Jane then expressed himself as a fake psychic saying that there is no such thing as psychic and he started working for the CBI to catch Red John....Being a consultant for the CBI Patrick has solved every case that were assigned to them by his amazing observation and mind skills....Almost every episode he found clues about Red John and getting closer to catch him....Every time he get close Red John reappears and murders...For all know Red John is a master mind criminal....As things get close Patrick gets close to get him..His team Teresa Lisbon,Kimbal Cho,Van Pelt,Waynbe Rigsby helps Jane with his problems....Finally at season 6 he will find out who Red John is......I watched till season 6 and now heading over to season 7 the last...Its really thrilling,exciting,horrifying,funny..... So friends I recommend you all to join Patrick Jane in his adventures to get RED JOHN!",2015
10,*** This review may contain spoilers ***,2014
10,"I've always been a huge fan of The Mentalist. Granted, it does offer the same premise as some other shows--grieving man loses family, uses his uncanny skills to help solve crimes, etc. However, Simon Baker brings such incredible depth to his character I find it hard not to be sucked in by his performance in each episode. The way he looks at people sometimes, like he can see right through them... it's so interesting to watch. Baker is absolutely Patrick Jane. The way he walks, interacts with people, his facial expressions all are completely tailored to this complex character that you can't help rooting for, despite his many flaws. I love seeing his mind work to spot the little things others can't in each episode.",2013

3,"Season 1 started out great with a lot of twists & turns & a great cliff hanger at the end. The seasons after that were filled with some highs and a LOT of lows. The highs of the previous seasons were introducing the vampire King Russell Edgington as well as Alcede & the weres. The LOWS of the past seasons included Jason's ""Soldiers of the Sun"" morons, Crystal with her inbred- uncle-daddy-brother-cousin-were-panthers (UGH!), and the orgy-goddess-maynad Maryanne. It also got STUPID when they introduced Sookie's gay faery family & had them in the middle of a field while inside of a nightclub, stripper poles included (but invisible) 0-o. Jessica became ANNOYING with no real story as well as Jason who is nothing more than a dumb jock who can't control his erection. I'm assuming the writers of the last few seasons came from the Bravo or Logo Network considering almost EVERYONE is GAY OR BI. They also had yet ANOTHER new character Marnie the witch who cast a spell on the vamps & turned Eric into a CLOWN. Sookie went from HATING him to madly in love. Watching their Harlequin-romance-novel relationship made me want to puke. This brings me to the end of last season, the infamous ""LILLITH."" I have no words to describe the STUPIDITY! Bill has drunk her blood & has completely lost his $h!t. After watching that DISASTER, there's nowhere else for HBO to go but up.",2013
1,Who doesn't like a show where the writers care so little about their audience that they take the most hated character on the show and make them immortal?,2012
9,"OK, I just watched episode 1 of this new HBO series, created by Alan Ball (""American Beauty,"" ""Six Feet Under""), and there is simply no question in my mind that it's going to be one of the hottest things on TV.",2008
9,There is no doubt in my mind that True Blood is developing it's die-hard cult fans even as I write this. ,2008
5,"...""True Blood"" fails as compelling storytelling in almost every way possible. Even that hoary old daytime serial, ""Dark Shadows,"" was far superior, despite its comparably minuscule budget. Never mind the generally excellent production values, laudable camera-wrangling, and a slew of pop songs to highlight Nathan ""Hostel"" Barr's quirky score, ""True Blood"" falls on its face in two key respects: one, in its desperation to cram as many nubile bodies into the cast as it can, presumably catering to its primary gonad-driven audience, its story lines are pretty much reduced to little more than sexual hijinks of mostly the lowest order; and two, the characters and plots are uninvolving, derivative, cardboard dross. I suppose I'm just getting old, but this sort of pap is LCD pandering of the worst sort; I'm sure that Charlaine Harris is a very nice lady, but she can't write a realistic character to save her soul, and her conception of an intermingled vampire/human world is sheer nonsense. I gave Season One a good six or seven episode effort, and finally had to give up in despair of finding anything to latch onto. The whole affair is simply laughably bad, and not in a good way at all. Good luck to all involved, I guess; I imagine it's a fine paycheck, but none of you are doing anything worth paying serious attention to, not even the baring of breasts, butts, and bodies. Yawn. Strictly for vamp geeks of indiscriminate tastes, and pervs of even less discriminate bent. Thank providence I didn't have to pay a dime to watch any of it; all I lost was a few hours of valuable time.",2011
8,"Another interesting, entertaining, and slightly on the odd side series from HBO that should have more than enough sex and blood for those more discerning fans of our mythical long toothed friends, the vampires.",2008
1,"After watching some of HBO's great stuff - Band of Brothers, Rome, etc. - I must say I had pretty high expectations before watching the first episode of ""True Blood"". Jeez. Often the script seemed to be written by an 8-year-old, some parts are just horribly filmed, (The scene in which she ""saves"" Bill, I mean come on. She throws a chain at the guy and ow! it goes around his neck and it magically chokes him! That was pretty embarrassing if you want my opinion. Or a few moments before that scene, when she finds out that the couple is gone with Bill, ridiculous. She hears them plan their stuff, and like 5 seconds later, magic! The 3 of them are gone, and without any struggle or noise or anything!",2009
8,"I like it. I just picked up the books on recommendation from a coworker and ended up reading nearly the entire series in 2 days (I'm halfway through From Dead to Worse right now). It's rare that I can sit down and read a book in a few hours and even more rare that I can read an entire series without a break, but these books are that good.",2008
4,"This show had a lot of hype but I didn't know about it until the midseason (season 1). Someone even recommended the show to me. But I decided that if I was going to watch it, I was going to wait until the end of the season so I could watch it in bulk. Due to the show's format, I'm happy I waited. I imagine it would have been fairly annoying have nearly every episode end in the middle of some cliff hanger then have to wait another week to find out what happens in the next second of the story.",2008
1,"This review is based on the season premier of Season 7 Ep. 1. If this is a view of things to come, then I would rather opt out now while I still have respect for the show remembering what it used to be. ",2014
3,"For every series that makes it to television, a 100 ideas are formed, 50 scripts are written, 15 pilots are made, and one, just one, actually makes it to production. From such a selection process, we are lead to believe that the final product must be the cream of the crop, for what other reason could so many ideas be rejected to give us a single television series.",2008
6,"As many of you know, I am ends oriented and committed. At season 6 of this series, I am so invested in these unlikeable and unrelatable characters that I just can't stop watching. But it's literally gotten to a point that I can't even hate-watch it anymore. I just hate myself. And I kindly ask you to cancel the show so that I can begin reclaiming my dignity and my life. I mean, sexy slutty teenage quadruplets? Come ON! It's getting so bad that I actually thought Jason's weird homoerotic shaving scene was a brilliant device with literary merit and hardly noticed that it was just a gross list of bad penis entendre. Here's why you need to stop.",2013
1,"You might as well be bland and pedantic if you watch this. You might as well be looking to go back to high school, to relive all the pathetic meaningless crap you always wished to get away from unless you had been the common whore, who regrets it only after she has her 4th child and nobody pays child support. You might as well call yourself the person who never grew up(unless your under 15). \\ What rings a bell to me is how boring this is, and how intolerable the actors and whole progression of this childish series. The only thing they have is that one dude pecks, I can't deny that, but fuc3k are women so stupid they watch for some dudes pecks? Have they heard of porn? \\ To sum this up, you need to like really pathetic drama, and a lot of it. In fact this is a soap opera, on weak sauce. The only justification is the hype, and it's hype by people you think is boring and repetitive.",2012
1,"If it were possible, I would have given this filth a zero. The show, ever since the start of its run, has quickly deviated away from the books, which I made the mistake of reading after starting to watch this trash. The constant sex was annoying and how Sookie's character is portrayed by what's-her-name is so off point. She doesn't even look like the Sookie as described by Ms. Harris. The show is screwed up beyond fixing and can't even follow the plot of the books anymore. It'd be a miracle if they did. I don't even think I can write ten lines for how awful this show is. ",2011
5,"I must say, I have seen more of each and every actor on this show than I ever cared to see, and I fast-forward through most of the sex scenes (which is about 30 minutes of each episode). Having read the Southern Vampire Mystery Series first, then looking into True Blood, I am really disappointed. There must have been a group that converged in the writing room that said ""let's take the character names, the town names, the basic idea, and pervert it into something to please the masses."" And please the masses it must because it just keeps going and going. I try to keep up with it because I love Sookie Stackhouse from the novels, and I like her interactions with other characters. For the most part, the novels pan out, only occasionally are they so over dramatic that I am dissatisfied when I reach the end. In this series there really is no light at the end of the tunnel. All of the depressing characters carry on with their bleak existence, and always, always, having tons and tons of sex. I have no idea whose idea it was to include sex scenes in almost every single episode, but that person should not only be fired, they should be tried in court. I love the interviews with Charlaine Harris where she says that she is always surprised at what comes next in the show because it is so different than what she had written... she is really saying ""I am not responsible for this!""",2013
1,"As a fan of the Sookie Stackhouse books, I find this series to be a totally crass representation of them. Vampire Bill is not very good looking and looks much older than described in the book. I found that they have made already wonderfully colourful characters seem very course and vulgar. One of the things I loved about the books is that despite all the crap that she is going through Sookie is always a lady, and yet in the TV series she doesn't seem like that at all. Not only that but the prejudices displayed in the TV series are not nearly as wide spread in the books. I didn't expect an exact replica of the books but I at least expected the feel of them to be used for the series.",2009
1,"I am absolutely baffled as to how this show has an 8+ star review. I am by no means a TV/movie snob, but damn this show sucks. The only interesting part of this show is the original premise of vampires ""coming out of the coffin"". Besides that, don't waste your time. I watched the whole first season hoping to find out what all the fuss was about, but was ultimately disappointed.",2012
6,"so, i read everyone else's reviews. it seems that if you are a Buffy/Angel fan, then you will more than likely loathe this series. otherwise, there's a chance you will really dig it. that is, provided lots of sex, especially really creepy sex doesn't freak you out.",2008
9,"A great TV show, I love the genre of horror and supernatural, and this is a different take on the vampire legend. The acting is superb and the story keeps you intrigued right up till the finally. These are some great cameo's and I'm hooked. I can not wait for the second season to start in June, their is a couple of slow episodes, but isn't their always to these shows, just like dexter lost and heroes great with a few bad episodes but is a must watch. the main characters are played fantastic as is all of the supporting cast. I hope that this doesn't get axed as some TV series do, like carnival which I was enjoying. But do watch you won't be disappointed",2009
2,"When I first watched the show, the first few episodes seemed promising. Bill Compton introduced himself as the stereotypical ""mysterious"" vampire and Sookie presented herself as an independent woman.

4,"I hope whoever coached these losers on their accents was fired. The only high points are a few of the supporting characters, 3 of 5 of my favourites were killed off by the end of the season (and one of them was a cat, to put that into perspective).",2009
5,"As a long-term fan of Charlaine's Southern Vampire Mysteries, I've been looking forward to True Blood since I first heard about it a year ago. Since Alan Ball had said he really liked the novels, I had high hopes that he would stick to the existing characters and situations that made the novels so popular - and some of my favorites. In fact, I was really excited and couldn't wait to see the show.",2008
10,"If you haven't seen True Blood on HBO, you've missed out on some of the greatest moments on television. True Blood, without a doubt, is probably one of the most controversial, violent, sexualized, and satirical giants on TV. If you don't think so, change the channel and see for yourself.",2012
10,We've been subjected to enormous amounts of hype and marketing for the Dark Knight. We've seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie.,2008
10,"I got to see The Dark Knight on Wednesday night, the reason though why I'm writing this movie comment this late is because I didn't wanna just jump and say this movie was awesome, I wanted to think it through, still today, I can't stop thinking about this movie! The Dark Knight lives up to it's hype and goes beyond it, this is the Batman movie that goes where no other Batman movie has gone before. It gave us a real sold story, we are finally told why the villains are the way they are, how all the injustice in the world can get underneath Batman's skin, how you have to believe that people still have faith in good on Earth. Heath Ledger, I absolutely loved Jack Nicolson's performance in the 1989 film, when I first read that Heath was signed onto The Dark Knight, I was like ""What are they, kidding?"", once you see The Dark Knight... Heath was incredible! I'm not going to compare Jack and Heath's performance, because they were two different versions of the Joker, but Heath's Joker was definitely the more scary and intense of the two nominations. You didn't know what he was going to do next, he was so crazy, he was also so charismatic to the point where you could relate to his character, and the worst part is not only that he's crazy, he's driving Gotham crazy and treating everyone like little puppets on strings that he can control, and guess what, he is doing it so well with a smile on his face. ",2008
10,"Christopher Nolan's second bundle of joy ""The Dark Knight"" EXCEEDED all  of my expectations!!! With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman  franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it,  amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more  gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times  throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to  fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if  his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his  fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the  help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael  Cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But  the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly  enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack  Nicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker.  He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY  disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime  and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original  cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal  and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a  much better performance and is a far cry from the ""damsel-in-distress""  stereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in  films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around  more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly  improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than ""Begins""  in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal.  Also worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the  film an added frosting to an already delicious cake.  Simply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than ""Begins."" The  action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud  Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who  sadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing  in Mr. Nolan's talents for this second installment. Although some may  feel a bit of melancholy over Ledger's death, but as a final note I  will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor  him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a  human being and father to his daughter Matilda  Ledger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his  daughter for years to come. Remember . . . Honor him not only for this  role and past roles, but as an incredible individual and talented  actor.  Rest in peace. Heath Ledger: 4/4/1979-1/22/2008.",2008
10,"I couldn't believe ""The Dark knight"" could live up to the hype. That's perhaps the biggest surprise. The secret, I believe, is a stunning, mature, intelligent script. That makes it the best superhero movie ever made. As if that wasn't enough, Heath Ledger. He, the newest of the tragic modern icons present us with a preview of something we'll never see. A fearless, extraordinary actor capable to fill up with humanity even the most grotesque of villains. His performance is a master class. Fortunately, Christian Bale's Batman is almost a supporting character. Bale is good but there is something around his mouth that stops him from being great. ""The Dark Knight"" is visually stunning, powerful and moving. What else could anyone want.",2008
10,"I used to leave a theatre after seeing a highly anticipated movie, specifically a sequel, and be so revved up about what I saw that I would declare that movie to be the best of a series. After each of the prequel ""Star Wars"" films, I rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason, I steer away from that mindset, and did for ""Dark Knight"".",2008
10,"I must say I was excited for this movie since the instant BATMAN BEGINS appeared on screen at the end of the first film. It was always going to be good, and sadly, it was always going to be over-hyped by the advertising warhorses.",2008
10,"Im just gonna start off by saying I LOVE this movie.Its one of my favorites of all time. I honestly cant think of too much wrong with this movie other than its a little long and Batmans by now infamous voice. But everything else is top notch. The acting,story,atmosphere,and actions scenes are all amazing. If you haven't seen this movie see it right now! I went into this not expecting to much but I came out blown away, I cant imagine any movie being much better. I'll just have to wait for The Dark Knight Rises to release to see if anything can be better. Until then, this stands as the best movie I've ever seen",2012
9,"Dark, yes, complex, ambitious. Christopher Nolan and his co-writer Jonathan Nolan deserve a standing ovation. I don't usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. ""The Dark Knight"" is certainly loud and violent but it's not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience. What he's done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions. Bravo!",2008
10,"I thought Batman Begins was a very well conceived and put together  movie. We finally get Batman as a fully rendered character. We gain new  insight into his motivations and the variables he must contend with in  his role as protector of Gotham. We get to see Gary Oldman as an  honest-to-goodness good guy. And we get to see Liam Neeson conducting  perhaps his strangest facial hair experiment yet.  But after seeing The Dark Knight, Batman Begins will forevermore be  viewed (by me at least) as a handy little prologue to a FRICKIN'  MASTERPIECE of a superhero film.  To say it's the deepest mainstream comic adaptation ever produced would  be akin to calling the Nolan/Ledger Joker 'a bit eccentric'.  While watching it, I found myself thinking it was very long, which is  usually a sign that it's TOO long, and therefore boring. But that's not  actually the case here. The script is bulging with ideas, philosophical  musings, THEMES, which Christopher Nolan is not content to gloss over  in favour of cool set-pieces (as many comic adaptations are), but wants  to explore, wants to allow the characters to explore, at a logical  pace. So, what I guess I'm saying is, considering what it sets out to  do, the movie is long ENOUGH, while still constantly holding the  viewer's interest.  And that's not to say the thematic exploration comes at the EXPENSE of  big action, either. On the contrary, there is some truly awesome stuff  going on here. The chase with the truck, for example, is fantastic, and  there's some great hand-to-hand stuff too.  But what engages us most is the characters, and, while the script is  brilliant (the dialogue is sharp, and quite funny for the first  two-thirds, before the drama really kicks in), this mainly comes down  to the cast.  Christian Bale. Taller than Michael Keaton was. More menacing than Val  Kilmer was. Less like Adam West than George Clooney was. Solid and  committed as always. He gives the character LIFE, and actually makes us  feel for him. The word 'tortured' keeps coming to mind...and I suppose  it's pretty appropriate.  Heath Ledger. Y'know, I'd heard talk of an Oscar nomination, and  thought it sounded a bit dubious. A Batman villain? Winning an Oscar?  Is that what it's come to? Then I thought, is it because he didn't get  one for Brokeback? Or more dubious still...is it because he...died?  But...well...how can I put it...?   It seems a bit blasphemous to compare Jack Nicholson to Cesar Romero,  but after seeing Heath at work...Jack (who once seemed so awesome) just  looks...well...lame.  If you've seen it, you hopefully get what I mean. If you haven't...you  need to. You will discover the true definition of commitment.  Maggie Gyllenhaal. I didn't have any problem with Katie in the first  one (at the time), but I doubt she could have pulled off the more  emotional stuff Rachel goes through here. Seeing recasting was  necessary (does Tom have a problem with his wife being involved with  Batman? Too many bad memories perhaps? Why am I even talking about such  garbage here?) they could have done a butt-load worse than Maggie. She  rocks.  As does Aaron Eckhart. But I'm not giving ANYTHING away. Suffice it to  say my mind was blown...AGAIN. Makes Tommy Lee Jones look like...you  get the idea.  Michael Caine. Still one of my favourite actors. Alfred is the shiz.  Morgan Freeman. Morgan Freeman. AOK.  Gary Oldman. As in BB, no mania. No psychosis. No nervous tics.  Absolute subtlety. Manages to hold his own alongside Christian, Heath  and Aaron without resorting to parlour tricks. Sign of spectacular  talent. Go Gaz.  Eric Roberts! William Fichtner! Michael Jai White! Tiny Lister!  The whole thing is just a big bag of thoughtful, well-executed  entertainment. It's equal parts cerebral and visceral. Ideas and  action.  I've liked every Batman movie so far (okay, besides Batman & Robin),  but this one makes them all look pretty bloody ordinary.",2008

10,"I think the big question...or the question everyone actually cares about is this: Is Christopher Nolan's follow up to the critically acclaimed 2005 film ""Batman Begins,"" The Dark Knight, as good as everyone is saying? Quite simply, yes, yes it is. There is no doubt about it, one of the most anticipated movies of the 21st century duly deserves every amount of praise lavished onto it. This is no ordinary superhero movie, this is a character and dialogue driven piece, not as action orientated as you might expect.",2008
10,"(Synopsis) Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale) continues to eliminate crime in Gotham City with the help of Lt. Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) and the new District Attorney, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). The Dark Knight wants to finally get rid of organized crime for good and be free of their corruption. Batman soon finds that a new psychopathic mastermind known as the Joker (Heath Ledger) has taken over organized crime. The Joker's plan is to terrify the citizens and throw the city into chaos, and kill Batman. Batman takes the fight with the Joker personal, which makes him confront his own beliefs. The Joker is the most dangerous criminal that Batman has encountered, and he will need all his strength and vigilance to defeat him.",2008
10,"Batman has always been my favourite superhero ever since the first time I heard about him because he his human with no powers, also he is much more questionable than any other superhero. The story of the film is about Batman, Lieutenant James Gordon, and new district attorney Harvey Dent beginning to succeed in rounding up the criminals that plague Gotham City. They are unexpectedly challenged when a mysterious criminal mastermind known as the Joker appears in Gotham. Batman's struggle against the Joker becomes deeply personal, forcing him to ""confront everything he believes"" and to improve his technology (which introduces the recreation of the Batcycle, known as the Batpod and the Batsuit was redesigned) to stop the madman's campaign of destruction. During the course of the film, a love triangle develops between Bruce Wayne, Dent and Rachel Dawes.",2008
10,"I saw the dark knight about three years ago when I was in the 8th grade. And I was blown away at how beautifully done it was, the camera work, the acting, the story, it all took me by surprise. It is to this day one of the best movies I have ever seen or will see. No other movie can impact you in such an intense way than The Dark Knight. It is a movie worth seeing due to the fact that the workers put so much time and effort into this one film and they did not want to waste money putting up garbage. So Christopher Nolan, thank you for not wasting our time, instead earning our time with this film. To this day I still am anxious to see the movie at home. I recommend it to anyone who likes action movies in general. To anyone who doesn't, don't waste your time write bad reviews about this film.",2012

10,"The Dark Knight maintained the intensity and overall gunmetal grayish feel that sets this Batman apart. The film takes us to a Gotham City that has grown accustomed to the big bat's crime-fighting crusades, and the last remaining big time criminals have actually grown fearful of his wrath. They form an alliance to attempt to keep their illicit business activities alive but are feeling even more pressure from yet a different angle: the passionate and fearless new district attorney, Harvey Dent. Recognizing the crime group's looming extinction, a stranger enters their circle and offers what he thinks is the only solution: kill Batman.",2008
1,"I'm very disappointed and this rating reflects my disappointment. It could have been so much better, easily. First, it's as if there's no obstacles the characters couldn't overcome by snapping their fingers. It's just too easy for the Joker and Batman to do all what they do. It seems the writers didn't want to be bothered by realism and it's one of the main reasons I didn't feel involved or excited at all. Batman pulls out technological rabbits out of his hat to move the plot forward - it's contrived and not entertaining. The Joker sets bombs anywhere he wants without facing any obstacles. His team of super terrorists can fill a whole hospital with explosives in a few minutes after it has been evacuated - or was it before? Anyway we don't see them setting up anything, everything is done off-screen and it goes into action without any kind of dramatic buildup. How did his gang do this or that? Doesn't matter cause there's an explosion coming soon. *YAWN* ",2008

6,"Many commenters said they were ""blown away,"" so it probably has succeeded in blowing away the box office. I waited until the second week, and had high expectations from the 9 and 10 ratings it was receiving. But, fellow movie/film viewers (and especially great film lovers) ... really!? There's no doubt about the action and action and action in this one, and thus, the special effects. That's the main reason I enjoy such fantasy flicks -- the comic book genre. So, this one does more of it and perhaps better than the last Batman and the last Spiderman and the last super heroes (but I would not rank it up with Iron Man). So, special effects and makeup may earn it awards.",2008
7,"Christopeher Nolan is a talented director. With batman begins,he created such a fantastic atmosphere that he brought batman character back in game. With the dark knight, he made not only a great second sequel, but also one of the best movies of the past 10 years. He mixed action, heroism, feeling, literature, colors so well that you feel kind of high when the movie ends. There is no doubt about it. ",2008
1,"I am deeply shocked. I am really shocked that this film made it all the way to the top. It's OK with me that it is a huge success at the box office. I can cope with it that many, many people do not have the same taste as me. Even though it is a little sad because I think this somewhat strange taste of the comic buffs will influence the movies in the future even more. There are interesting articles about the influence of the bloggers and hardcore fans on producers and directors. What really shocks me here is that many, many acclaimed critics fail to see how bad this movie is. They write about hidden stories, meanings and messages. The war in Iraq, the war against terrorism, a reflection of American society and so on. They write about hilarious performances of the actors. They write about stunning visual effects. Some of them may even write about the tremendous script. Fortunately so far I did not read anything about the scriptwriting. So I try to begin with that issue. Well, the script is so down, down, deep down below that I don't even know where I shall begin. I guess the guys who are more in the comic stuff will tell you that Jonathan Nolan really did a good job in adopting the stories and the mood of the comic books. But for me this is no reason to write a story that lacks everything and is so brain dead that I'm gasping for air. The plot is annoying and predictable. The characters are written really poorly. First of all Harvey Dent. His turning into a fallen Angel is so incredibly incredible. It may result from the way that the brains of the comic buffs work. 9 Pictures or less per page. I that time you can turn from a white hero into a black devil. But this is a movie. And no 9c trash book. To say it clear  and you may have noticed  I am no comic fan. But I like for instance Sin City very much. It is a very good adaptation into a now medium. And it is visually very interesting. Visuals. As I said Sin City is visually very interesting. The dark Knight is not. Totally not. Almost two decades before we saw TerminatorII. Oh my god, this was something new. And Two Face  Aaron Eckhart looked a little like the wrecked Arni back then. Don't get me wrong the make up apartment did a very good job. It is just so sad that we already saw it all before. (Just like the inspection of the new weapons Is this a scene of one of the Bond Movies?) Or take the Matrix (Part1) about one decade before. Visually the dark knight is not one tick better or more interesting. Maybe on the same level. Sin City was something new. The dark Knight shows us common techniques in a slightly higher perfection. The directing is average. Not outstanding. It must have been a logistic masterpiece, OK. But we have seen it before. The acting. I can't even say if the actors are bad. I think it is the story that is so poor. The Joker is good. Heath Ledger is good. Not brilliant or something like that. It is solid work. And he is the only character that is somewhat interesting and not full of pathetic crap. Well to draw the conclusion again. I can live with it that this movie is that successful at the box office. I can not live with the super high praising comments of professional critics. For action entertainment this movie is too long. At least one hour is simply annoying. (Again the writing.) So, who ever has some bucks left go see this movie and see what brain damaged means.",2008
8,A friend of mine got me into SOA as it isn't anything likely to hit our screens here in Oz. Ironically enough the theme of the show is not that far removed from a lot of the bike gangs we have here and hear about but i digress.,2009
8,"FX has done it again. Another excellent show that we sit on the edge of our seats during, and wait impatiently for all week. If the common opinion that shows improve the longer they run rings true for this one, then I predict a perfect rating by season 3 and it will be in the running for all time great. The timing couldn't be more perfect with the great ""The Shield"" coming to a timely close. Sons of Anarchy takes on a classic Hamlet premise with a dead dad under potentially shady circumstances, a wavering prince, (or in this case vice president of the biker club), wondering what the right path for him is. Should he take the more philosophical path of his deceased predecessor or the hard core gangster approach of his mothers current husband and president of the S. O. A. biker club. The first season is only half over and my wife and I are already dreading the wait for season two. A special kudos for Katey Sagal, I didn't expect her to be able to shed the memory of Peggy Bundy of ""Married With Children"" but she has been able to create a strong Queen of the club character that is easy to love and hate all at once. Find the time for this one, It's like a white trash Sopranos with a story line that actually goes places.",2008
10,"I decided to watch ""Sons of Anarchy"" initially because I am a fan of Charlie Hunnam (a seriously under used and under rated actor,) Ron Perlman and Katey Sagal. What I didn't expect was the best ensemble I've seen in a TV show in years. Every cast member is spot on and the three I mentioned are positively brilliant. In the first five minutes, I completely forgot that Charlie Hunnam is British because his American accent is excellent. This show is heavy on violence and rough language, but it all fits in with the story...as do the occasional sex scenes. Everything about it is excellent: the acting, scripts, sets, cinematography and direction. I'm thrilled that this excellent show will have a second season. If you haven't seen it, all episodes except the finale (to come) are available on line. I hope many more people will watch this terrific show.",2008
10,"This is without a doubt the best TV show I've seen in ages. There is nothing about this show that one can't like.Every character is well defined and has it's own boundaries. The story line has enough twists to keep you on the edge of your seats through out the episode. And it may come across as strange, but you don't wait for the next episode because you wanna know what happens next (as in Prison break etc) you wait because you absolutely love the show. I envy the respect the S.O.A have for their members and what they are willing to do for one another. ",2008
10,"OK, I saw Sons Of Anarchy by mistake a few weeks back (I recorded the wrong program) I Had heard of it but never really fancied it! Bikers and all that, not my thing! I had major doubts about Charlie Hunnam, I have only ever seen him in one thing before and that was a movie called Green Street (Hooligans) where he played an East End Londoner (West Ham) football fan-cum-hooligan! He is from Newcastle and his accent in Green Street was terrible but he must have had some voice coaching because in SOA he accent (usa) is spot on, all but the odd word! I watched the first episode and thought it was awesome! But then again, how many first episodes are awesome, only to be followed by a totally average rest-of-season? But I am so happy to say that I was wrong! I am up to episode 10 and each one is better than the last! It's not your average knuckle head biker show! It follows the trials and tribulations of each and every cast member! I really can't recommend Sons Of Anarchy enough! 10/10",2009
3,"If I had to consolidate into one word all of the unpleasant emotions I've undergone in my painfully slow journey through five seasons of this cartoonish series, the term ""frustration"" would fit the bill perfectly. If you plan on diving into this show expecting the universe in which this story takes place to even remotely resemble our own, you too will feel this frustration. I am actually thoroughly appalled to see such high praise for this show, and it troubles me to think that this might somehow be The Best Thing On Television Right Now. ",2012

8,"I almost didn't give this show a chance because Hollywood rarely offers up fully developed biker characters, much less decent or realistic plots about outlaw biker clubs. If there's a Harley and black leathers in the shot -- bad guys killing and doing bad things -- their work is done. Not so with Sons Of Anarchy.",2009
4,"I hate it when a series starts out fresh and interesting and then bends into the boring predictable ""formula"" drama series. We used to have guys we loved and guys we hate, now I don't see the difference; who's the good guys and who's the bad guys? You really need characters you root for, and others you can't wait to see them beaten out of their victory. I can't tell the difference from or the other this season, there isn't one character I care about anymore. SAMCROW used to care about the town and many residents knew that and were happy they were there, not anymore, old alliances seem to have vanished due to the open violence, killings, and beatings. Sorry Kurt, you had it going good; then all the flip flops, hate her-love her, love him now he's doing what the last bad guy did, or worse-he's dead. Your good guys are bad guys or don't stand a chance. Your good guys are hard to tell from the bad guys. Everyone I used to like is dead or is easily stepping into the bad guy's shoes very well, so they are not good guys anymore. I loved that you originally based your story line on King Lear but that whole story is long gone. You have successfully killed off great characters and a great story line that was original and kept you in front of the TV on Tuesday nights. I'm sorry, when I miss it now I don't even record it, I'm not rooting for anyone now. It was so good and I loved it. Now it is just convoluted. Sad good-bye.",2013
2,"Two stars for some of the actors, who are gamely doing a good job with very thin material, and the musical scoring, which is outstanding (CDs of the show are highly recommended). Otherwise, this is a fantasy of an office worker, who thinks being a biker means being able to commit crimes with impunity and living a porn-fantasy life of sleeping with every hot woman, including strippers and porn actresses, and zero consequences. ",2013
3,Okay so after hearing from many sources that Sons of Anarchy is a great TV show i decided to give it a shot. I found the pilot episode rather boring and so decided to give the show a fair chance and watched another 8 episodes. The problem with this show is that they are trying to mix a soap and a gangster drama like sopranos. Now even i critiqued that sopranos could have done with more action but sons of anarchy takes it to a whole new level.,2013
5,"A few years back I had already seen a few episodes of this show. That was enough for me to decide to ignore this show. Now after all the good reviews, and on the advice of friends and the fact that I am real series-junkie, I decided to give SoA a second chance. And yet, this show can not convince me as a quality drama show that it should be. Too bad, because this show certainly had potential. I have often heard the comparison with The Sopranos. And to be honest it did remind me of The Sopranos. But that is not a plus. Rather a big disadvantage. Where the script with the sopranos is genius and has a very realistic feel, this series is filled with too many coincidences in the important moments. These events feel like they are forced. After a while watching this show you know actually how most developments will go on. Plus I find most characters flat and one-dimensional, making it caricatures rather than real people, so I do not feel connected to them. Also the acting is not that great. (casting could have been much better, one of the few good cast is Katey Sagal, great acting performance). What I really miss is the (black) humor. You would think that there would be a lot of laughter and bullshitting with each other in such a biker gang? That would also displays a deeper bond of comradeship. A missed opportunity in my opinion. The creators are trying to be funny which is done very poorly, because it often don't feel genuine, so again it feels like it has been forced. (Eg the man with his compulsive need to satisfy himself with his hands... that is too easy thought up IMHO). Ultimately all these shortcomings ensure that the many events which follow each other up in very high pace make little impact on me. The momentum continues in it, with lots of action, which makes this series so popular in my opinion, because it must be said that this is well cared for in this show. The many action scenes does look good and the music is often well chosen, which is also immediately the few plus points of this show. So no, this series did not convince me. I can understand that many people like to see this show, because of the many action, but to say that this is one of the better series of recent years no... I don't think so, therefore, this series has too little depth and too many coincidences.",2013
3,"This show has officially jumped the shark...The club members are near bullet/bomb/fist proof and even when held at gunpoint, manage to get the jump on their attacker with skill that would make James Bond look like Forrest Gump. This includes their women, who have escaped being held at gunpoint early every other episode. (Honestly, when a gun is trained on a Son or an old lady of a Son, count on them pulling a Jason Bourne and snatching the gun). They engage in bare knuckle brawling, are shot, and survive bomb blasts with nary a scratch.",2010
10,"There is nothing about this show that isn't fantastic. While, at times, it can be a little too realistic (with levels of violence rarely seen on TV), the characters and plots are wonderfully written.

5,"I read a review of this moronic show that compared it to Hamlet. Well, friends, Charming, CA ain't Denmark but there's something' rotten in it: This series. What amazing talent, though. Ron Perlman, who has done European art films. Charlie Hunnam, who has done Dickens for BBC. Kate Sagal, who was the iconic wise-ass mama of ""Married With Children"". Kim Coates who has played countless psychos to perfection. On and on. What the hell are all these great people doing in this turkey? The pay scale must have been tremendous. My major objection is an ethical one: This series portrays violence and crime as admirable pursuits with dignity. This is not only false to the core, but it is at the root of its poor writing and poor acting by some great actors. I watched several streamed episodes of the first season on Netflix out of pure boredom. I can't even begin to imagine who sponsored this trash when it had commercials. Harley Davidson? Male jock-itch cream? Dominos Pizza? My rating of 5 is too generous, but it is a pity vote for the good actors who felt needy enough to submit to this bad writing.",2012
1,"I would love to know. I want to see that show. The one I watched, and I watched 2 whole seasons, is appallingly bad. I can't even understand how or why I made it through 2 seasons. Each episode only got more ridiculous. It's a daytime soap disguised as a hard-hitting drama. A federal agent shoots her witness then frames Katey Sagal even though Sagal just shot someone else with a completely different gun? Who's buying this? The leader of the Mayans has to be the DUMBEST dude in the history of mankind! Every time he shows up on screen he's getting burned by SAMCRO. The writing is purely guttural and shows no thought process whatsoever. The acting is laughable. It...it just defies explanation how this show is so popular. What I witnessed is a complete disaster. Someone PLEASE tell me where the good one is!!!",2011
5,"When I first started watching Sons of Anarchy, I admit, I found it quite entertaining. However, as the seasons went on, it became a far fetched (and I mean seriously far fetched - like science fiction) slaughter fest. There is a total absence of brotherhood that the MC supposedly has. Everyone is out for themselves in this show, and I mean everyone.... at least everyone that counts. The ones that are not, are insignificant or killed off. Nothing ever goes as you hope it would. You bond with characters, only to see them wronged in some freaky scenario that only a Hollywood writer can come up with.",2014
1,"I started watching a year ago. I really gave this show a chance, after really annoying, bad written episodes in season 1, but season 2 made it even worse. This is by far on of the worst shows in the last 5 years and I still don't get it how anyone can rate it above a 5 or 6. There are so many logical mistakes, bad acting, ""a-team like"" shootings from professional killers and bad casting choices. When you reach season 3 and get to Ireland, you won't stop laughing. Sure, some shots made in Ireland are not that cheap but Ireland looks like California - with a blue coloring and every house needs a shamrock painted on a wall.",2012

The acting is top notch and as others have said, you find yourself rooting for the ""bad guys"" just like The Shield and The Sopranos. How cool is it seeing ""Peggy Bundy"" in a hardcore role? I also like the way there are several story lines developing, which allows you to attach yourself to several characters. I am anxiously awaiting season 2. My only fear is they may have gone to deep too quick, with lines in the club apparently being drawn with Jax & Piney vs. Clay, Tig and the hardcore members. But we'll see.Bring on season 2.",2009

9,"Cmon everyone, plug in your rating. Hard to believe this show hasn't received the minimum 5 votes. It obviously has received enough attention to garner a following. Perhaps the viewers of the series don't find it necessary to vote. However, I think it helps others all over the world get a sense as to whether the show is worth even checking out. In this case, it definitely is. At least for the guilty pleasure factor. The show could be a little better if they laid off some of the generic TV series scenes. But, ultimately it is better than 90% of what's out there. However, I have only seen the first 5 episodes, so it may be that I'm being set up for things to get a little darker. I'm enjoying catching up on the first season and look forward to the second season beginning in a few weeks. I appreciate F/X supporting a series like this, as TV needs to challenge the audience more. Shows like ""The Sopranos"", ""Six Feet Under"", ""Big Love"" are the gold standard, so let's keep it going.",2009
1,"I loved this show, and have given it five stars up to now. However when Kurt Sutter sank to a level of such sadistic inhuman depravity as to graphically rape himself on screen, well, that went a little too far. This scene was so overwhelmingly disgusting and viciously brutal it will forever be burned into my memory banks. Remember you can't ""unsee"" something. You see, it was then that I realized what this show is really about: Kurt Sutter's graphically sick, self-indulgent, self-absorbed, twisted vision of human life. Really, that is his true intention, and overall the only value this show has to offer. Is it interesting and engaging at times? Yes. Is it full of awesome acting and, I'll admit, plenty of good writing? Yes. But that doesn't excuse the rotten core of this vile excuse for creativity. Breaking Bad had similar scenes, though not quite as disturbing. Kurt Sutter wishes he could be Vince Gilligan and fails miserably, in the most awful and egregious way. While Breaking Bad was cosmic in its character study (for which the violence was in the service of), Sutter's Suns is the exact opposite: he uses his characters as a backdrop for the vehicle of his own sick, personal projections. At least Quentin Tarantino had artistic vision. What an utter waste of celluloid.",2014
10,"If you are among the few who haven't seen it yet: believe the hype, it really is THAT good. Breaking Bad may not depict reality the way 'Generation Kill' or 'The Wire' did - but then it's not about that, either. From an artistic point of view - performances, writing, direction, camera, music - this show is every bit as good as the other two mentioned above, but unlike those, 'Breaking Bad' just wants to entertain and therefore enjoys a lot more creative freedom.",2014

10,"I probably haven't been hooked to a TV show like I am to Breaking Bad before. This beautiful piece of art is incredibly well written and directed, furthermore the actors are doing a tremendous job! I've read a few remarks about the pace of the show, saying it is too slow. I completely disagree, there are so many aspects which get their place in the series, every single one in its own way and it would be horrible if we'd see a too fast paced show containing ridiculous cliffhangers like we see them on the major networks. Because this way you can entirely fall in love with the show, the characters and every tiny detail of the story and the best part of it, it is unbelievably addictive and makes you starve for more week after week!

Almost everything out there is stupid drivel that insults the intelligence of educated human beings. ",2009
10,"BREAKING BAD:Season One explodes like a sucker punch to the gut, and is nothing short of mind-blowing. The pilot for this series is a definite ""Must See"", and stands with the greats of Action/Adventure Television and Cinema. This segment begins at such a giddy peak, that you think the only way forward would be to tell the tale as a long flashback. However, through a marvelous piece of editing and writing, the plot miraculously moves forward from that point. Bryon Cranston's idiosyncratic performance is a joy to behold. He embodies a man who is against a rock, and an even harder place, who has no other option but to throttle his higher aspirations and grimly carry on. His solace and validation in middle-class morality and virtuous conduct is long gone. I eagerly look forward to more of this ambitious, entertaining series.",2009

10,"To say this program has great writing is an understatement. BB has the best writing I have ever had the pleasure of listing & reading (I always leave the captioning on). The acting is top notch by Cranston. It is also very good by Aaron Paul (Pinkman), Dean Norris (Hank), Betsy Brandt (Marie), RJ Mitte (Walt junior). Unfortunately, it feels like Anna Gunn (Skyler) is the weak link. It is hard to know if the Gilligan is trying to make a somewhat awkward and unlikable character, or if it is just not hitting the mark. I prefer to think that the writing is intentionally odd for Skyler for some reason, and that we will get to learn more in the episodes and seasons to come. The dialogue is absolutely brilliant for the most part – it almost always rings true. The episodes are gripping (for the most part). The story is brutal and comedic at the same time. I have to opt for a 10/10 because there is not another program that comes close – even Dexter which I've been enjoying for 5 seasons doesn't have the writing or acting to stand up to BB.",2010
10,"Drug wars, meth, the lot. I thought no thank you. I kept hearing how good it was and I kept saying: ""No thank you"" Last January I got sick, one of those illnesses you can't quite figure out. Maybe it was pre and post election depression, I don't know. But I stayed in bed for almost 10 days and then it happened. I saw the first episode and I was immediately and I mean immediately, hooked. I saw the entire series in 9 days. Voraciously. Now I had time to reflect. Why I wonder. When I think about it the first thing that comes to mind is not a thing it's Bryan Cranston. I know the concept was superb as was the writing but Bryan Cranston made it all real. His performance, the creation of Walter White will be studied in the Acting classes of the future. He is the one that pulls you forward - as well as backwards and sideways - then I realized that his creation acquired the power that it acquired, in great part thanks to the extraordinary cast of supporting players. I could write a page for each one of them but I'm just going to mention Aaron Paul. I ended up loving him. I developed a visceral need to see him find a way out. Well, what can I tell you. I know that one day, maybe when my kids are old enough, I shall see ""Breaking Bad"" again. I can't wait.",2017
9,"What an awesome change of pace for Bryan Cranston, who is best known for playing the goofy dimwitted Homer Simpson like dad from Malcom In The Middle(2000-2006). But this character is not goofy or dimwitted. Walter White is your everyday man, who is a high school chemistry teacher, and has a loving wife and handicapped son. On the verge of his 50th birthday party. He begins having a mid life crisis, to make matters worse, he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. But not wanting to leave his family with nothing, in a quick way to make a lot of money. He teams up with a former student named Pinkmam(Aaron Paul) who is now a drug dealer, to make the drug called Crystal Meth. You don't like what Walter is doing, but at the same time you try to understand why he is doing it. I like watching the transformation he is going through, like Mr.Chips turning into Michael Douglas from Falling Down(1993). This series is quite enjoyable, it's a good dramatic series, with some humor moments. Cranstons performance in the show is memorable, and at times heartbreaken to watch. And he and Aaron Paul play off each other so well. I hope it will last a little while.",2008

As the weeks go by I found myself thinking ""really, there are 5 seasons of this"". I am truly diverse in my tastes and don't get offended very easily at all. I love gore, gritty, sci-fi, fantasy, comedy, romance, animation. You get the picture I really do not discriminate and instead judge on it's merits. But I found that Breaking Bad exhausted me. Five seasons of disgusting, corruption, ferralness, deplorable human behaviour took it's toll on my level of appreciation for this show. If it had been shorter I would have enjoyed it more. I know it was revolutionary and truly realistic but in the end I despised it for being great and the fact that I had to see it through to the end.",2014
8,"This show is one of the bright spots of this train wreck of a 2008 television season. Bryan Cranston has to be IMHO one of the best acting talents out there. Just compare and contrast his portrayal of the clueless father on ""Malcolm in the Middle"". On ""Breaking Bad"" his character light years different. That's not to say that his roll of Hal on ""MITM"" was inferior to the character of Walter White here. However he shows his ""range"" here VS. there. There is going to be the inevitable comparisons to ""Weeds"" and unfair or not there are parallels. Both center on basically good people forced to make due in order to survive or keep their families solvent--bottom line give ""Breaking Bad"" a chance I'm betting you will be pleasantly surprised. My only problem with this show is the incessant bleeping of the ""colorful language"". Either don't include it or don't bleep it, it gets very annoying after two or three bleeps.",2008

10,"What I so love about ""Breaking Bad"" is that we know it leaves a legacy. It's not when we see sales skyrocket for a show. Not the Emmy awards. But when we watch a finale that does it the right way (sometimes, it works to do it the wrong way), and it leaves us speechless. It's not only that we are actually satisfied with this series finale, it leaves on that rare high note that other shows cannot seem to catch through their runs. They either stagger, or take a strange road. Only ""The Sopranos"" knew how to go down the ambiguous road, and it fit perfectly. ""Breaking Bad"" takes us from good to bad, and the journey is not a straight line. It zigs, it zags. It dings. it explodes. What we have here in the finale goes beyond the ambiguity and finds the spot in hell that each and every character deserves. All ""Breaking Bad"" has ever done is tick like a time-bomb, and all through ""Felina"" I could hear that ticking. It takes a second time to appreciate ""Felina"", and the whole series all-together, because its so dark and deep, the dig continues. Each season is a cakewalk compared to the next. It grows yet dies. ""The Sopranos"" gave us a playground of deep emotion and a ride into the subconscious. ""Breaking Bad"" gives us the results of the up and the down without cutting to black beforehand. It cuts right when it needs to, because this is an open and shut story. A story that weaves through all the predictable shows and gives us unbearable suspense, all due to the fact that it can be so unpredictable. It is beautiful, in the darkest of terms. How rarely does the puzzle piece fall into place so masterfully.",2012

Don't get me wrong. it's a good series, but it's not IMHO worth all the ""Best series EVER!""-hype. Plot holes and random events are my main gripe(Plane crash and Jesses gasoline spree are just two of them). Then there is that 3rd season, which is good in the last few episodes but the rest of the season kinda sucks(a whole episode about swatting a fly for example). Season 4 and 5 is very good indeed, lots of tension and good drama. The ending i could see miles away, albeit good but very predictable.",2015

But again, it is so subtil and I love watching Bryan Creston getting in the ""skin"" of Walter White. This is acting at it's best!!! THIS MAY CONTAINS SPOILER Some of you may have not seen this show, but there is a reason why it earned so many awards and high level reviews. This is NOT a show about drug and how to make it (although it seems that way), but to me, it's a show on ""how far are you willing to go to protect your family""...and then, ""how far are you willing to go to lose your family"". The cast is just awesome, with Jessie, Mike and Saul as bona fide supporting actor. I watched the whole seasons all over again few months ago and was just amazed by it as the first time around.

Perhaps I had too high an expectation from the onset but boy did some episodes bomb out. Conversations were dragging, plots were thin, some were so drawn out that I had resorted to the 'forward' function just to get things going. Too much was revolving around the 'local' scene, perhaps they should have written more of the cartel factor. Anyway, it seems like a 'self fulling prophecy'. Everyone gives good reviews, comments about the show, so it has to be good. Perhaps there isn't anything spectacular out there so this has to be good. Not that Prison Break was my favorite but it will run circles around BB. Granted season 5 of BB was good, but 1-4... only marginally acceptable. I'm a long time reader of the reviews here but this disappointment on BB urged me to write this review.",2014

So far this year I've had a surprisingly rewarding experience with chick flicks, usually finding at least something positive to cling onto during the course of the feature, and at times even enjoying the movie as a whole. Yet today was not one of those days, as sadly enough, my male attributes got the better of me. With all of this said however, despite my obvious problem with connecting to any of the characters on the screen, I found it hard to believe that anyone could do so regardless of gender, age or anything else; Wild Child is formulaic, dumb, mawkish and irksome not just through it's naïve, inane plot but more importantly, through its just as- banal characters. Devoid of any real likable personalities or interesting, original characterisation, director Nick Moore's feature length debut neither sustains any entertainment value nor offers any significant insight into the script's themes. Younger, female audiences will probably appreciate it a little better than me, but not by much.",2008

I'm not really into teen movies these days, because I feel that all of them seem to be the same. But not this one though it was edgy then most teen movies.

The dialogue is fast (I actually found it a little too fast for me to keep up with in places - but I'll catch up with what I missed when I see it again!) and there's plenty of it. I like films with plenty of dialogue and found what the girls were saying to be interesting. An example might be the way they had found ways to circumvent the school's rules, e.g. as regards their mobile phones. There is plenty of action and visual humour and a few touching bonding scenes - as well as some quieter and more introspective moments. I thoroughly recommend seeing this entertaining, thought-provoking, moving and most enjoyable film .",2008
1,"I had to watch this with my young nieces, and honestly, it made me sick. Cliché-ridden doesn't even begin to describe this drivel. I had never seen anything with Emma Roberts before and after this certainly never will. OK, as a rule it's a hard act for Americans to compete with English actors, remember colourless Andie McDowell in Four weddings"". E. R. may be talented, well, I doubt it. She shows just one facial expression, to distract from which fact she is flashing about her skinny white legs and freakishly pointy knees. She looks totally bland and forgettable, especially in that horribly obvious blond wig in the first half, in no way prettier than her English counterparts. And since when is being a Californian particularly exotic? But the story's pretty boy falls for her almost at once, oh yeah. She doesn't even have to play hard to get, au contraire. Actually not even a better actress, say a young Jennifer Aniston, could have saved this horrible story. There is the obligatory dressing up scene – Roberts's aunt had a legendary one in ""Pretty Woman"", but whereas erstwhile prostitute Julia/Vivien emerged as an elegant lady, Emma/Poppy goes from spoilt brat in super-high heels to pole dancer-prostitute look-and-act-alike.

Still, I am glad I looked pass that and went on to watch the entire movie. The movie is, first, definitely not any Oscar or any award material. It's just some feel good movie. Something that makes you laugh and wanted to hate the villain. It's done fairly well in my book. Though to me, Emma Roberts looked too much like she's trying to ""Addie Singer""-ed the role (yes I did watch Unfabulous, I have young cousins) and turned it Malibu. From where I stand, I think Ms Roberts could have done better, but she's young, I suppose there are time to learn. Alex Pettyfer aren't too bad, but seeing I've watched Strombreaker, I couldn't stop seeing him as ""Alex Rider"" just yet. He's a little stiff, but pleasant.",2008

The soundtrack also contains many popular hits that me and my friends love. Emma Roberts plays her character Poppy fantastically and really shows her development throughout the film. Having a good looking lead boy also helps. ""Wild Child"" really conveys the struggles of teenage years for example the love story between Poppy, the Head Girl and Freddie, the headmistress' son. Also, Poppy's conflict on whether to tell the truth about the fire or not mirrored real life decisions that many teenage girls have to make. I absolutely love this film!",2009

Tomorrow they are tooling around the countryside, by themselves no less and start taking sniper fire. No wait here they are back in Bagdad. There is no cohesive story at all. The three main characters are so overly characterized that they are mere caricatures. By that I mean, we have the sweet kid who is afraid of dying. We have the hardened military man who is practical and just wants to get back safe. And then we have the daredevil cowboy who doesn't follow the rules but has a soft spot for the precocious little Iraqi boy trying to sell soldiers DVDs. What do you think is going to happen??? Well, do you think the cowboy soldier who doesn't follow rules is going to get the sweet kid injured with his renegade ways?? Why yes! Do you think the Iraqi kid that cowboy soldier has a soft spot for is going to get killed and make him go crazy? Why yes! There is no story here. The script is juvenile and predictable!

The focus is on American soldiers in the Iraq war. But it's not about them being involved in assaults or shootouts. Instead we're shown the lives of a bomb squad. Jeremy Renner is commanding as Sergeant First Class William James. He provides an excellent performance. So do Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty as his partners. They really do act like real soldiers. The Hurt Locker consists of a series of bomb threats that the team have to overcome. These are all thrilling, tense. What makes the film really shine, however, is its anti-war messages. In the tradition of Apocalypse Now (1979) and Come And See (1985) The Hurt Locker shows that people get hurt and killed in wars, even if they don't deserve it. It shows that the victims are just like anyone else except that they're in a war zone. The film doesn't directly criticize the American war effort. There are no discussions about whether the Iraq war is moral or immoral. Bigelow's direction is truly impressive. She certainly knows how to work with actors. The acting is obviously superb, and this is the film's greatest strength. Also notable is the cinematography by Barry Ackroyd. The war hasn't looked this realistic or this interesting in cinema until The Hurt Locker. The images captured are thoughtful and memorable. No wonder the film was the big winner at the 2010 Academy Awards. Some films that win Best Picture don't deserve it, but The Hurt Locker sure did deserve it. It's one of the best war films ever, and I highly recommend it.",2010
1,"Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal are already preparing a sequel about a young US corporal in Afghanistan. He also happens to be a highly-qualified surgeon and is roaming freely around Kabul, operating on wounded NATO soldiers. On a particularly difficult mission, he casually picks up a sniper rifle and shoots Osama Bin Laden from a distance of about 3000 yards. He is then finally promoted to sergeant, but is unable to decide between a sniper and surgeon career, so he quits from the Army altogether. One year later, frustrated with civilian life, he joins the Navy and the last scene shows him proudly wearing a white uniform.",2010
10,"Kathryn Bigelow concocts a masterpiece of a film without tricks or gimmicks, at least none to be detected and that in itself is a triumph. Realistic yet poetic like the works of the great masters. It enters and fits a genre and at the same time is unique, unexpected. It shutters, moves and alters every sense, like a powerful drug. I saw it last night and I'm going to see it again tonight. Last night Jeremy Remmer came to speak to the audience in a face to face moderated by Sam Rockwell, great idea but it change my perception of Remmer in the film, of his character. Although he praised Kathryn Bigelow, he said things like ""I don't tell her how to direct and she doesn't tell me how to act"" Watching the film I felt that childish arrogance belonged to the character by his personal appearance showed it belonged to the actor. In any case, it works on the screen. A character you warm up to almost immediately in spite of his contradictions. Remmer will remind you at times of Robert Redford and others of Michael J Pollard. He is truly terrific so try to avoid his personal appearances not to contaminate that impression. The rest of the cast works wonders and the brief cameos by Guy Pearce and Ralph Finnes are the most organic and unobtrusive cameos I've ever seen in my life. All in all extraordinary. I predict, even if we're only in June, that Kathryn Bigelow risks to be the first female director to win the Academy Award. She certainly got my vote.",2009
1,"After watching this movie, I actually had to check twice whether or not I saw the correct one. Either critics have suddenly forgotten everything that the movie industry has produced until now, OR there are other interests at stake. And considering who the director is (a woman - no offense to all), I suppose it's safe to assume that the second option is the correct one.",2010
1,"I joined this site specifically to comment on the scene in this film which showed SAS soldiers acting like raw recruits when confronted by a sniper, whereas a US bomb detonation squad dealt with the situation as if they themselves were elite forces. How a movie containing a ridiculously conceived scene like this can win any Oscars is beyond me. Would a bomb detonation squad in the US have a sniper masquerading as a bomb disposal squad member? Also why do they take all day watching the insurgents hideout? Can you imagine this happening in World War 2 for example, the war would have been lost if the Allies had approached every battleground with this kind of nonsensical caution. There are many other questionable scenes in this film and I don't understand how anybody with a modicum of intelligence would vote for it to receive any sort of prestigious award.",2010
1,"This movie won the Academy Award for ""Best Picture of the Year?"" Seriously? Are you kidding me? I think that tells a lot about the Academy Awards and how completely stupid, pointless, useless, and misleading they are.",2010
10,"The Hurt Locker is a serious character study and a taut, suspenseful action thriller at once.",2009
10,"I spent the entire film grabbing the arms of my seat. I was there in Irak, steps away from my death and the death of those around me. The tension, the suspense is at times breathtaking, literally. ""The Hurt Locker"" is a miracle and the definitive consecration of a great filmmaker, Kathryn Bigelow. This is also a rare occasion in which I went to see the film without having read a single review or knowing anything about it. One should try to do that more often because the impact of the surprise translates into pure pleasure and in this case, sometimes, you have to look away from the unmitigated horror. Jeremy Renner is a real find. He is superb. A kind soul, wild man with enough arrogance to make him appear reckless and yet his humanity precedes him. People may commit the mistake of avoiding this gem thinking that it's just a war film. Don't. It isn't. It's a great, engrossing film about human emotions, not to be missed.",2009
1,"I just rented this today....heard lots of good reviews beforehand. WOW!! What a pile of steaming poo this movie is!! Does anyone know the address of the director so I can get my five dollars back???? Finally someone bumped ""Stop-loss"" from the 'Worst Iraq War Movie Ever' number one spot. To be fair, I don't think there are any good Iraq war movies anyway, but this was REALLY bad. ",2010
9,"Military and war movies are problematic for me, at least modern-era ones; I wasn't in World War II or Vietnam but the post-Desert Storm era Army is a very well known quantity for me, and military movies set in this period (to include those set in the current Iraq / Afghanistan wars) almost always get some nagging thing wrong. Lieutenants and Captains don't call Colonels by their first names, and no one would ever wear a class-B wool sweater into a jungle at night, just to name two examples I've actually seen on screen in recent years.",2009
1,"I was eager to see this movie even before the Oscar's, but never found the time to do so until last night, when I saw it on Blu-ray. This movie has got to be the biggest disappointment ever! The plot is twisted, but not in a smart way, just in a pointless way. The characters are dull and shallow, as are the dialogs between them. The cinematography, while probably the most attractive feature of the film, is hardly groundbreaking or innovative in its intensity. The movie, supposedly so close to reality in Iraq, is riddled with factual errors and inconsistencies, which make it completely detached from the reality it purportedly portrays (please refer to goofs here on IMDb). All in all, I cannot fathom why anyone would nominate this for the Academy Awards, let alone actually award 6 of them. It's probably one of those instances when Hollywood attempts to be political, and the only reason the 'Hurt Locker' got any awards is because it is the first majorly distributed film portraying the ""dark-sides"" of the War in Iraq since Obama took office...Personally, I found Chicken Little more suspenseful..",2010
10,"Except for the first few minutes of ""Saving Private Ryan,"" no film I've ever seen comes closer than ""The Hurt Locker"" to portraying the randomness, senselessness, brutality and -- yes -- the excitement of battle. With the exception of Ralph Fiennes who makes a brief appearance early in the movie, there are no stars and few recognizable actors in this story about a small group of men whose mission is to defuse improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in Iraq. Frequently under surveillance, though not always certain whether it is by curious bystanders or enemies in civilian clothing, these men are at risk every moment they are in the field.",2010
9,"For some of my friends this was just a solid action movie, nothing else. I watched it yesterday and for me it was much more than just action, this movie was a deeply affecting series of shots that make truly feel the war in Iraq and make you see the sacrifice that's going on out there.",2009
2,"I watched this movie in HD on Italian cable TV. My expectations were so hight! This movie has been judged better then the fantastic Avatar, so it had to be absolutely stunning. Minute after minute I was convinced that this could not be the 6 Oscar winner, I had to double check it. OK, the direction was not bad, but all the film was completely senseless, it looked to me as a classical American B-Movie. The plot looks incredible, you lose so many times the reasons of why something is happening. For example the taxi driver who does not stop: why? Even the story of the young boy selling DVD is not so clear to me.. This movie is miles back Black Hawk Down, a classical city guerrilla movie and is really impossible that beat Avatar if not that the judges of academy award were drunk.",2010
1,"I went to see this movie simply to see what all the hype is about, and I was as disappointed as surprised about how it got 6(?) Oscars and 7.9 rating on IMDb as of today.",2010
1,"I have read a lot of criticism from soldiers. I'm not an solider but I have some knowledge of military tactics and some common sense too. The movie is ""disconnected and detached"" as some may say. It is more collection of action scenes than story that has real sense, there is very little psychology, some bizarre lines. But it is incredibly illogical. For example the ""sniper scene"": Insurgents are hidden in the house. You are on top of the ridge. This is bad spot of course and the first US guy gets killed. The other takes the same gun on the same place and STAYS here for hours. This is very bad decision of course! The ridge is on the east, the house is on the west. You stay on the ridge until the sunset - sun shines directly into you face which means you cannot see anything but the insurgents must see reflection of your scope lens very clearly. This is very strange. In another scene you see team of three pyrotechnics searching building which has only recently been abandoned by insurgents - very dangerous! In later scene these three guys try to find insurgents in the buildings during the night - they even SPLIT and try to find them INDEPENDENTLY. This is not only risky, this is just plain stupid. Stupid. I just don't believe that US soldiers are so dumb and so badly trained. The script is unbelievable, pure B to C grade! I have no idea how this crap won so many Oscars - is it because of its ""anti war ideology""? I have been very disappointed by this movie.",2010
1,"Oh. My. God. Please rent this so you can see why everyone with sense hates this movie (all except the Clique Elites of the Academy of course) Things I'd like to share off the top of my head: 1. The fact that this beat Inglorious Basterds for best picture simply astounds me. 2. Tarantino was completely shafted. 3. It was more like a ""Made for TV"" show than a major motion picture. 4. It won because of stupid left-wing politics...( it was about the Iraq war and it was a war movie directed by a woman. 5. It had constant non-steady cam filming (like a made- for-TV show). 7. A lot of the acting stunk 8. The plot was hollow and insipid. 9. Stupid. 10. Dumb. 11. Bad. 12. Not good. 13. Not realistic. 14. Shallow 15. Annoying. 16. Boring. 17. Weak. 18. Awful. 19. Boring. 20.

7,I was lucky enough to go to a pre-screening of Hancock last night and I really enjoyed it. I don't understand all of the criticism this movie is receiving. Everyone take a second and realize this is not a Marvel or DC comic book superhero movie. Now think about that again. It is a different story entirely and has some very unique elements.,2008
6,"Will Smith. That's all you've got to say, and you're guaranteed a big opening at the box office. Well, from the looks of it, Smith also guarantees you at least a mildly entertaining film, which is what we get in his latest movie, Hancock. In the hands of any other leading star, Hancock would probably end up being a below average film. It's Smith's charisma, charm, and unwavering likability that ultimately save the film. He can make you laugh, cheer, cry, and even root for his character (who is a total ass, as he is reminded a number of times throughout the movie) no matter what kind of shenanigans he may cause.",2008
8,I've read a lot of the reviews here complaining about the film flagging in its final act. I respectfully disagree.,2008
8,"Lots of people, including the critics, are ragging on this film. Seriously, what did they expect? It's a Hollywood blockbuster with Wil Smith in. Get over it, turn your brain off, and sit back and enjoy the ride.",2008
8,"Hancock was a pretty interesting as well as entertaining movie. It definitely wasn't your typical superhero movie; and it wasn't originally a DC or Marvel comic. It's more about what would happen if someone with superheroes was around in modern times, and that is what makes it interesting. If there's some property damage done while catching criminals, people will be angry; if a vigilante has a bad attitude, people will be angry. I suppose Batman explores some of that not being liked by the public, as well as the bad attitude and personal trauma of the hero, but I found Hancock to be quite original in its handling of these issues. I liked the media attention and the use of sunglasses as a ""mask"" of sorts. I really liked how Hancock progresses as a character, and I liked the other characters as well. Usually little kids in movies annoy me, but the son of the supporting character was pretty cute and endearing. This isn't really a hero movie where there is a superhero and a super villain; I think it's more about what it means to be a human and relate to other people, to do good things and the desire to be accepted. I think the best part of Hancock is that it's about a superhuman who is just very human. It was a lot of fun.",2008
7,*** MAY CONTAIN SPOILER ***,2008
9,I saw the movie tonight and enjoyed it a lot so here's my take: ,2008
6,"I also was at the test screening in Peoria AZ. The film was spot on for the first hour. Jokes were hitting left and right, Smith and Bateman displayed good chemistry, and the special effects, though not always finished, were eye popping nonetheless.",2008
8,"The latest Will Smith effort is much different from the average big budget flashy superhero movies that have dominated the box office the last few years. Don't go to Hancock thinking you are seeing another Superman, Fantastic 4, Ironman or Hulk. The superhero angle is treated much differently here. I think part of the perception problem with this film is from the silly trailers we have seen for the last 6 months. Those trailers represent a small part a movie that is so much more to than a drunken superhero throwing a whale at a boat, swearing at a kid or wrecking the city. Sure, there are laughs in this movie, but it's Will Smith! He's FUNNY! Go see Hancock because it's DIFFERENT from the mega-budget movies that come straight from the comic book pages complete with a witty Stan Lee cameo. Don't get me wrong, I loved Ironman and The Hulk. But Hancock is not a movie that will have comic book geeks arguing on message boards about how the movie left so much out and the character was nothing like the comic. It is a film with a story that happens to be about a guy with super powers. Besides, it's got Will Smith and Charlize Theron in it! How can you go wrong?",2008
3,"...was the reaction I had by the time I finished watching the movie. As much as I have a distaste for using stupid internet acronyms seriously, that's quite literally how I felt.",2008
3,"they say will smith is the last remaining box-office magnet, but it won't stay that way with movies like this. the only good thing about hancock is the idea of a superhero drinking and being rude, but we had that already in superman 3 (or 2, or 4, cant remember). apart from that hancock is average cinema-stuff, a little dull, even boring at times. then they have this surprise in it, which makes you think: wtf, cool! but then it turns out to be completely random. with no real villain and plot holes over plot holes this movie is just not good. wait for the DVD and rent it if you're a will smith fan, for all the rest of you: stay away and go watch the dark knight instead on Friday.",2008
8,"I caught a preview showing of Hancock tonight. I enjoyed it for what it was which is a fun, mostly fast-paced popcorn flick. The writers of the film also tossed in a nice plot twist that I didn't see coming but it turned out to work just fine. This isn't Shakespeare so I don't demand a lot of deep thought just some escapist fun. Will Smith does an excellent job of playing the disinterested superhero with an existential crisis. It was good to see Jason Bateman again but a bummer as well seeing how he has aged. This means I am not so young myself anymore. Jae Head didn't overact nor did the script writers push the ""cute"" button to the point of being saccharine. It will be interesting to see how this movie performs to see if Smith wants to do a sequel. So I am more than happy to recommend Hancock to fans of the ""Summer Blockbuster"" and those who enjoy Will Smith.",2008
9,"Perhaps I'm being generous, but I think this movie deserves some credit. It's a serious take on a dysfunctional superhero that isn't based upon a Marvel Comics or DC Comics character. The special effects aren't as good as a movie like Transformers, but at least you aren't getting an animated CGI character hopping around like you do in Hulk and Spiderman. It appears that several elements of this movie may be inspired by the now defunct Broadway Comics. The classic scene of a car being skewered on a spire was depicted in the ""Powers That Be"" comic and the dysfunctional marriage relationship in the movie is not unlike the ""Shadow State"" comic by Broadway. Perhaps seeing similar depictions hit the big screen made me appreciate the movie more.",2008
4,"Hancock began life as a good idea and with a very intriguing premise; it bills itself as the alternative superhero film by aiming to show that the Superhero can be humanized. The film centers on a down and out alcoholic superhero called Hancock, played by the ever impressive Will Smith. He is a superhero that causes destruction and fuels his own public hatred where ever he goes due to his lifestyle and his indolence. It becomes fortunate therefore that one day he should save the life of PR man (Jason Bateman), who is married to the lovely Mary (Charlize Theron) and that in return for saving his life he chooses to help Hancock change his image.",2008
5,"A very good idea sadly undercooked. Rushed and thoughtless but with hints at what it might have been. All of that makes the experience a rather frustrating one. Will Smith is, without question, one of the best actors around and as Hancock, he uses every tiny opportunity to make the whole ludicrous thing almost palatable. When the camera is on him we feel the potential. There is a human being there in an impossible situation. Peter Berg, the director, lets his eye move around as if under the effect of a very powerful drug. Massive, nervous close ups in a story that tries to be missing the point at almost every corner. The actors are photographed harshly showing every skin imperfection even on the wonderful Charlize Theron. I wonder if that was on purpose. In fact that's what I wonder about the whole enterprise. Was it on purpose? Was the thoughtlessness part of the plan? If so, I don't get it.",2008

6,"The moment I saw the preview for Hancock, this just looked like the most ridicules movie that could be made, I was sure that it was going to flop or get horrendous reviews. But after talking to people who saw it, it was half/half of either they loved it or hated it, so I guess this was just a movie I had to see for myself. So I watched it yesterday, I am dumbfounded, I'm the half/half, I loved it and I hated it. I felt like the beginning was just silly and rushed, not to mention that the villain was just under developed and didn't have any depth to why he was so bad. But however, I did like the little twist they had, which I refuse to give away, even though I did predict it sadly, it's one of those things you'll have to see. But I also did enjoy the originality, it's not just a typical super hero movie with all the stereotypes, it was John Hancock(which by the way should've taken place in Chicago after it's famous building).",2008
1,"This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The plot is threadbare and totally predictable, and it's really only a minimalist vehicle for the special effects, which are also predictable (and violent and repetitive).",2008
5,"What drew me into seeing Hancock in the first place was its idea, which I found one of the most interesting for a film in a while. I am in all honesty not a big fan of Will Smith, but he has given some solid performances so I thought why not.",2011
1,"How do weak directors land $100+ budgets? The audiences are too stupid to know what weak film-making is. Berg's shaky, hand-held (and shifting focus) style is emblematic of a director walking on to the set with no idea what he's going to shoot. Just keep the cameras moving and try to pass it off as a ""style"". This technique is (over)used in the last few years, especially in action scenes to the point where now, it doesn't seem to matter if you can tell what's happening in a scene as long as you know a lot of 'stuff' is going on. To use this same technique in a boardroom where people are sitting around talking, just pulls you out of the films and asking yourself ""what the hell is THAT about?"" The same lazy, sloppy style was used in ""Constand Gardner"", another film that suffered from for the ignornance of not realizing that this technique can sometimes work in scenes of intense energy, angst or action...but doesn't play in others. If you're thinking about the direction, the director has failed...and Berg failed through most of the movie on this one.",2008
3,"When you need special F/X to make money on a movie, why bother with actors? Wait, they tried that with WALL-E and that movie pretty much failed as well. Hancock is yet another movie in, what I fear, will be a longer and longer line of disappointments. Smith is okay, not one of our greatest actors, but for the most part entertaining in most of what he does. I read that the part was first offered to Chappelle, which probably would not have made this movie any worse, or maybe better, since no one expects much out of him. Audiences do expect more from Smith and when he fails, as they all do, we seem to be more harsh, myself included. Theron, an award winner no less, well, I wonder what she was thinking when she considered this role. What we have is a down-and-out super hero who no one likes since whenever he saves someone he seems to cause more damage than if he did not. He's a depressed and lonely guy, but we only know this because another character tells us so. Otherwise, the audience figures he's just a drunk, but does not know why. In the first scene with Smith and Theron we all figure out that something is going on, and know that she probably has the same powers he does. The scene where they kiss then she slams him out of the house with a fridge made no sense. Of course we do not find out the why to all of this GO AWAY! from Mary until the end of the movie, so you have to sit around until then, or do what a lot of people do lately, and fast forward. But what really ruined this movie, other than a bad script, robotic-like performances with monotone dialogue, and over-done F/X, was the jittery camera work. Talk about needing some Dramamine before watching.",2008
9,"He is alcoholic, least bothered about your concerns and doesn't even give a damn about huge property loses the city faces with his heroic stunts. Thats Hancock for all of you!.

So, all you other super heroes get aside...here comes the Hancock.",2008
1,"OK, I must admit I'm not a fan of the Super Hero movie type. Generally I don't use to watch it and I don't use to appreciate it, but even so I can distinct when it is a good Super Hero movie, or a bad one, full of clichés and ""Hollywood garbage""! That said, I just can tell you my opinion about this movie: it sucks! But it sucks so badly! Aside from some nice jokes and some cool special effects, this movie has nothing interesting to offer! The plot is pathetic and gets even worse when it starts being melodramatic. The characters are laughable and absurd, even for a Super Hero movie, and if it's true that a Super Hero film can be entertaining, at least for the action or the jokes, this one completely spoils these two positive features with a completely absurd and melodramatic plot! And that ending, Oh my God, that was definitely too bad! To sum up: Bad job asshole (I can call you that how many times I want!)",2008
2,"Wild Wild West was OK, but still Will Smith's worst film. However, Hancock makes Wild Wild West look like I Am Legend.

5,"I reached a movie buff conclusion after the 2nd set of Star wars films. It's simply not possible to top an iconic, legendary film or series. The original can't be beat, and is next to impossible to match. Doesn't matter who directs, stars, the effects, etc - can't be done. Being sure of this in advance made the Crystal Skull easier for me to take - but I still have to be critical - because they let us down on the simple stuff. My other movie buff observation is - its ALWAYS the writing first. The STORY. The other stuff flows from that, making the film better or worse. In Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, the writing failed us. The story does not hold together well and the dialog rings intermittently false throughout the film. I wanted to love the movie - but I was disappointed. When I heard they were all waiting for the ""right"" script to make another Indy film - that sounded good. But it appears that wasn't really true. I have to assume they all just decided the timing was ""right"" and it would be fun to get the old group together to do a flick - because the script was poor. The movie is more like an attempt at what an Idiana Jones adventure SHOULD look like - but with no real substance. A series of Indiana like dangerous situations and exploits strung together loosely with some attempts at humor thrown in. But no clear beginning to end plot. No disaster to avert, no one to rescue. Nothing in particular to root for... The actors seemed a bit uncomfortable to me - even Harrison Ford himself. Indy's love interest from Raiders (Marian) was underutilized and apparently a bit rusty in the acting department. She seemed to be just ""thrown in"" to add a nostalgic romantic element. The young Mutt character was well cast and did a good job with what he had to work with. The story arc regarding Indys age, his old love and young Mutt is dealt with - but could have been a better, more solid part of a more well written story. I'm glad I saw the film. I enjoyed seeing Indy again, but my hope that I'd be wanting to go again didn't pan out. It's worth only one visit - and that just to see some Indiana JonesLIKE adventures - in a story that doesn't make much sense. Sorry to break bad news to anyone who reads fan reviews - but that's my story and I'm sticking to it. George - you should have fussed over the writing a bit more and Harrison - I'd have waited longer for the right script. This was a weak effort and it didn't need to be. Mr Lucas and Mr Spielberg -you surprised me on this one - and let us all down on the story. Just my opinion :) Scott (an Indy Fan).",2008
7,"Sorry, but after reading all this negative comments, I like to give you my thoughts on this. When I walked out of the movie I was not really satisfied, because some things bothers me, like the monkey-rope scene and some other ridiculous and illogical things. But, then I remembered scenes from the first three movies, like jumping out of a plane with a rubber boat and then bob run with it down the Himalaya. Or Indy hanging on top of submarine and then swims with it through half of the ocean (isn't such a thing going underwater sometimes?). Well, what I want to say is that in the old Indy films there where tons of ridiculous stunts and it always was very cartoonish and yes, often cheesy. But as I child I liked those movies for that. They are just adventures with a lot of action, mystic and fun, not more.",2008
7,"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) isn't a bad film -- there are a few dazzling sequences, and a couple of good performances -- but the unprecedented blend of comedy and action that made the movies so much more fun than any other adventure series is mostly gone. It is one of my personal favorite adventure movies even tough is a bad sequel but it is still good in my opinion. ",2015
5,"The film is making zillions all over the world so what does it matter that it's just a mediocre attempt to recapture the energy, the youthfulness and the innocence of the previous installments? Love of cinema, that's what made me react the way I did. How can it possibly be that the most powerful people in the film world could agree that this was the script that everyone was waiting for? Shallow, opportunistic, over long, over crowded and implausible in a way the other films weren't regardless of their own implausibilities because one was connected tho the soul of the enterprise. There is no soul here to cling to. It's all by the numbers, odd numbers at that. Karen Allen returns! But look at the clumsiness of her re introduction. I was bitterly disappointed but maybe it's just me.",2008
4,"Visually, with Henry Jones Junior (he is rarely called ""Indiana"" or ""Indy"" in this film) swimming in his baggy grandpa pants and shocks of grey-white hair peeking out under an ever-crisp, rarely-dirty brown fedora, you really don't get the feeling that you're watching anything historic--but a few of the old John Williams refrains drive something primal bubbling to the surface of those of us who grew up idolizing Indy.",2008
5,"I find it very amusing to read all the reviews here. I mostly agree with all the ones who found it disappointing, I can see why the Michael Bay-loving GTA-generation could give this a '10', however: Lots of CGI, fake green-screen action and style over substance.",2008
6,"Usually, when you go to see an action/adventure movie, especially an Indiana Jones movie, you're going to suspend your disbelief and just allow yourself to ""get into"" the movie. These kinds of movies are supposed to be mindless escapist fun. Still, one might expect some small modicum of plausibility or connection to the real world. When it comes to ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,"" forget about suspending disbelief. Just pretend you're in another dimension altogether. If you do that, you'll have have met one of the two prerequisites for seeing this movie. (If you don't believe me now, you will when you see this film and see our hero survive a cataclysmic event in a fairly cartoonish manner a mere 15 minutes into the film.) The other prerequisite is that you've seen the other three movies...religiously. A huge chunk of the entertainment value of this film comes from nostalgia, in-jokes, and self-parody. It is an entertaining movie and I had fun and laughed while I was watching it and the reason for this is because we are either enjoying seeing all of the same old gags done once again in a bigger and cooler way, or we are enjoying seeing those gags mocked. Trusty bullwhip? Check. Fedora? Check. Long car chase with fighting and leaping and what-not? Check. Dark tombs lit only by torches? Check. Gross creepy crawly critters? Check.",2008

10,"I guess being some 19 years odd in the waiting, if not the making, this was a movie bound to be a let down. Yet somehow, despite this - and being a fourth movie(!) in a series - it wasn't. Yes, some of the acting was sketchy... and perhaps (for better or for worse) played with sheer joy of revisiting a role rather than a tight grip on a character (I'm thinking Karen Allen here). But you know what, her performance worked. All the performances worked. Some were better than others... but the characters worked. The adventure and escapism - despite some all-but-lifted ideas now and then - worked. The mere fact someone could make such naive escapism work *at all* for an... ahem... now much older audience, is remarkable in itself.",2014
10,"I'll confess up-front that I wasn't expecting as much from this film as its three prequels. Harrison Ford is twenty years older, see, and I just couldn't imagine an Indy movie under those circumstances. But he did it, Indy did it, and the movie was an absolute wide-eyed riot! The action outdid itself in all its glory, all the humor of the chase scenes were fantastic, and overall Indy IV is one awesome come-back for Indy and Marion! See it ... you won't be disappointed. *I* wasn't, not in the least! :)",2008

This was a must to see on the big screen for me being a LONG time Indy fan. I think so many of us were so impressed with the first ones because we were kids. Times have changed as have expectations of special effects and realism, but it was everything I wanted it to be in old-fashioned Indy style! Bugs, snakes, evil Russians. It was so perfect to me that I forgot it'd been almost 20 years since the last one. Sean Connery was missed though. Great bringing back Karen Allen too! Shia was a perfect fit! A",2008

7,"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, the 19 year long awaited sequel, the big summer blockbuster is finally here! I was lucky enough to see the premiere tonite, my hopes were up, the audience was pumped, everyone was just excited, why wouldn't you be? This was the Indiana Jones to blow the trilogy out of the water. Unfortunately, I'm feeling a little empty, I am such a huge fan of the trilogy, movies that hold memories for me as well as excitement still to this day when I watch the Indiana Jones movies. Indiana is back, this film had a little bit of the old style that I was looking forward too, however, I feel like we were lied too. The makers of the film told us there would be no CGI unless it was needed like the old films, not only was there a lot of CGI, the older films had special effects, but they were real, this was a little too cartoonish at times. Not only that, but I felt like the 50's stereotype was being too rubbed in our faces: the jocks vs. greasers, the cold war fear, nuclear bomb testings, the Russians, and the aliens. I'm not going to lie, while the movie is flawed; this is still a fun action packed adventure film that is worth the full price ticket. I think the story was just more of a tribute rather than an actual movie on it's own.",2008
10,"Indy seems here to be putting into practice the lesson he learned in German East Africa while pursuing the Phantom Train of Doom. One is only as old as one feels. He's every bit as much of an action hero as he was in Raiders of the Lost Ark. All the essential elements are here. An ancient mystery, militaristic villains, fights during chases in army trucks, creepy crawlies, lost tombs full of human remains, the Paramount logo morphing into something else (in this film a prairie dog hill) and a grisly death for the villain. There are references to the previous three films and also the Young Indiana Jones television series. It would have been nice to have seen Sean Connery reprising his role as Professor Henry Jones but Sir Sean is quite adamant he has retired from films and when he says no he means no. Nice to have the tributes to the late Denholm Elliott in the form of the portrait and statue of Marcus Brody on the university campus. This film rounds off very well a marvellous series.",2008

Well mid way through the film I decided I was disappointed with this movie.

5,"All I can really conclude about this movie is that it was just okay. I can forgive the ludicrous plot, the cheesy ""family"" dynamic of the film, the fact that Harrison Ford is old (which is really nowhere near the worst part of this). I don't even really mind Shia LaBeouf's presence. But many of the stunts and the action scenes are so implausible that it renders all of the action scenes implausible. For example, Shia LaBoeuf sword-fighting (!) spread-eagled on two moving vehicles; a boat going over not one, not two, but three waterfalls with absolutely no one getting a scratch (I mean, what are we watching here, The A-Team?); and the ""if the film hasn't jumped the shark yet it certainly has now"" moment--Shia LaBoeuf swinging through the jungle a la Tarzan. It was ridiculous. And because these parts are (forgive my overuse of the word) implausible, it highlights the fact that the rest of it doesn't work, either. After seeing a number of old series trying to come back for another run (Rocky Balboa, Rambo, the Star Wars Prequels) I have concluded that when filmmakers attempt to cash in on a once-popular series, artistically the best they can hope for is to break even. Sometimes there really is nowhere to go but down. I wanted to love this, but the most charitable thing I can say is that it was just okay. Very disappointing.",2008
10,"I did not think Raider's was the best. But I may have not seen Raider's first. I think I actually saw Last Crusade or Temple of Doom first.. so long ago can't be sure tho. For awhile Temple was my fave. Then Last Crusade. Raiders is a classic, but it was never my fave. Most people's order goes like this: Raiders, Last Crusade, Temple. At least two critics on RT thought Cyrstal Skull was the 2nd best. I would agree, but time will tell if it remains in that spot, drops, or moves up. We forget that all the movies had flaws--weren't perfect. We forget we weren't 100% satisfied with them when we saw them at the time. We forget we poked fun at the films for their ""yeah right"" escapes and things the characters (mainly Indy) could survive. So since it's been so long and memories grow fonder with age, we want Indy 4 to be better than the previous 3 when there is no reason it should be, especially since Connery didn't stick around.",2008

It had just enough mystery to keep a intellectual interest throughout the explosions, horrific deaths (though, of course, the rating meant they were off-screen), and originally awkward interaction between the two main characters. While an attentive viewer will guess most of the ""surprises"" before they are revealed, the question as to how the movie will ultimately end makes up for any disappointment.",2008

Yes, it copies almost every recent political thriller and yes it rips off some other movies too, but don't most movies recently do the same. The action was good and the main characters at least were made to be real people that you could connect with. And Billy Bob Thornton was having so much fun and was at his best since Armageddon. This movie proves again that Shia LeBeouf has some talent, too bad he can't seem to stay off the tabloids. Michelle Monaghan also was very good.

1,"This movie is what is wrong with modern cinema. This movie is an insult to the public's intelligence. This movie is crap. First off I'm going to spoil the hell out of this movie because if I succeed in anything here it is to convince you to watch anything else. Watch Madagascar 2 if you have to. I give the movie a free pass on all the fantastic assertions it makes about the capability of computers. This is a supposed high tech, futuristic, super duper secret computer... so anything is possible. HOWEVER: 1) Hollywood needs to get it through their thick skulled craniums that the inclusion a powerful artificial intelligence does not have to always be the big bad wolf... I get the poetic significance of the human spirit vs. the evil machine but it's been done hundreds of times by people far better. Even collectively the writers: John Glenn, Travis Wright, Hillary Seitz, and Dan McDermott are not a tenth of what Kubrick is. 2) If there were such a super computer capable of anything from phone calls, traffic lights, planes, trains, TVs and satellites it seems a little bit difficult to fathom why it would need to recruit two numb skulls to do its bidding. 3) We spend 2 hours watching these two unwittingly participate in an elaborate, explosive (yet oddly perfectly timed) storyline to ultimately fail. Apparently our super computer wasn't smart enough to launch a missile, crash a plane, or any number of far simpler plots to take out our government. In fact... even to take the given storyline for what it was, all that was needed was a necklace and a note to be played at the correct time. We sat through 2 hours to see that complicated circumstance manifest itself? 4) Secret Service shoot to kill, they do not wound or wing or pleasantly ask strange men with guns shooting up the state of the union to please put your gun down. They kill you. Why didn't they? Well that's what big bad evil computers do. People don't kill people, that's just silly. 5) How is it a super dooper future computer with unheard of technology and fabulous artificial intelligence is brought down by a pipe to the eyeball? The thing takes up a 4 story room and its eyeball is the weak spot? Why the hell didn't they just stab it in the eye to begin with?!? I'd give this farce less than one star but Flixter won't let me. I'll be waiting for Eagle Eye 2. A supercomputer writes it and saves us from having to sit through another collaborative effort of the 4 nitwits that gave us this movie.",2008
6,"I think this is possibly the third film this year that has directly involved a higher power turning 'insufficient funds' into a considerable amount, and while this comparison is valid in a sense, that's where similarities end. From the trailers I was imagining Eagle Eye to be a cross between The Matrix and Wanted, but it's not not at all. No, it is neither creatively similar nor anywhere near the same quality. So despite some similarities, Eagle Eye at least delivers an experience that is refreshing, but at the same time familiar. Not much risk-taking is implemented here; there are virtually no new ideas of any kind, and the themes present have all been battered to death in countless novels and films that have frankly done the job far more successfully. Read aloud, the script could easily be interpreted to be a techno-phobe's transcription of a recurring nightmare; the government tracking us all on phones, cameras lip-reading us etc. etc. and for the most part, that is how the movie plays out. While these elements leave an experience that will always have you guessing as to where the movie is going next, the eventual climax of the film boils down to character rather than plot, and as a result of spotty characterisation, the film eventually falls flat. Despite some major issues however, Eagle Eye still manages to retain a sense of spectacle, and the story, although mostly a science-fiction dud for the most part, does move forward at a decent rate. In this regard, the movie makes for good popcorn watching, but not much else.",2008

I couldn't think who else could duck cars, cranes, the FBI, and still crack a joke that fits right in place. From Holes to Eagle Eye, Shia proves worth watching (okay, I Robot, was a bit silly). Eagle Eye does start out fresh and exciting in the beginning, gets a little boggy in the middle, and is soft at the end--BUT, it is still worth the admission price. You won't want to leave at anytime during the movie, the pace is so tightly executed. The stunt action is primo--the car crashes alone are standout. And the chase scene in the airport conveyor system is something else. The whole question of do we have too much technology is the theme. Don't forget to leave your cell phone at home.",2008

The plot seems to be driven along so slowly at times that your wondering how long this movie can possibly be. The movie was way too in your face with ridiculous action sequences that just don't seem possible, regardless of what the flick leads you to believe. Some of the action is somewhat enjoyable to watch, and that is where my vote of 5 stars comes from. But the lack of a creative, unique, or in depth story prevents any higher vote.",2008

2,"It's very rare that I think a film's such a waste of time at the halfway mark that I don't even feel like finishing it. This is one of those rare films. There's an unfortunate trend to make chase movies with quick cut editing, interlaced with CGI, lit very darkly to hide the fact that what you are watching is as unreal as most of it looks. Take away enough reality and you take away emotional involvement from the audience. There's no sense of danger and no feeling of wanting to shout, ""Look out! Go there!"" Car chases can be very exciting. It doesn't take a big budget to make a great car chase either. Look at any low budget action flick directed by Joseph Mehri (Executive Target, Land Of The Free) and you'll see that real cars, driven by real stunt people, shown in broad daylight, and in wide shots are far more exciting than close-ups of ""stars"" sitting in a studio in front of a blue screen mixed with quick cuts of darkly lit cars and/or CGI cars. When you can't tell which cars are which or where the cars are in relation to each other, you don't get too excited when the inevitable crashes and explosions occur. Apart from the horribly choreographed and edited car chases, train wrecks (man, that looked fake!), and running scenes is the fact that what is going on is impossible. When I saw cranes moving on their own in a junkyard picking up what I assume were high speed cop cars (again, you can't tell what's going on in the action scenes since they're so dark and individual camera shots last one second at times), I almost puked. Cranes are clunky, awkward machines. Yet they can pluck cop cars up from a 90 mph chase? Gimme a break. If this was The Transformers, fine, but it's supposed to be a real world suspense thriller. It's tough to care about any of what's going on since it's all just too unbelievable, cliché ridden, poorly lit, and quickly edited. Plus, the CGI looks awful. I read somebody's comment about the CGI being very good. Are people getting so used to putting up with fake looking CGI that they are used to it as just the way it is? That's sad. Give me real cars, real stunt people, lighting, and a story that's believable enough to be somewhat emotionally involving. Give me leading characters that I would want to have a beer with instead of wanting to punch in the face for being a sarcastic little know-it-all jerk. If that's what kids today consider a characteristic to aspire to, they're going to meet an awful lot of people in the real world who aren't going to put up with it for very long.

That's because I found that the first time I saw one of his animated films, I tried too hard to figure out what was happening and why--and it impacted my enjoyment of the film. Now that I have seen just about every Miyazaki film, I see the bizarreness and just take it all in--enjoying the beauty of it all. In many ways, these films (at least to Western audiences) is like drugs--lots of strange and beautiful images that don't always initially make sense but sure feel great to see!! Of all the Miyazaki films, this might have the most unusual and incomprehensible story line--even more so than SPIRITED AWAY and PRINCESS MONONOKE or MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO.

When I went out of the theater I had this strange feeling that something was missing, this ""magical"" feeling I was experiencing in all Miyazaki films before, but I couldn't say why it failed this time. After I thought about the other Ghibli movies, I may know the reason: this film had most of the elements of a great Miyazaki anime: cute characters, wonderful key animation, a great soundtrack composed by Joe Hisaishi and the warm story telling giving you the feeling of watching a high quality Japanese animation film. However, two elements were lacking: a deep story and dramaturgy. The purpose of this film was obviously to entertain small children with a simple story line as in case of ""Totoro"", so a complicated story as been told in ""Spirited Away"" or ""Princess Mononoke"" is not really necessary, but on the other hand, this story was simply too superficial. I could not connect to the main characters, because there was no character development, dramatic scenes were only limited and did not last very long. I really hate to give only 7 stars for a Miyazaki film, because I would give 10 stars to all previous movies right away, but this time it was simply not this wonderful ""ghibli experience"".",2008

Even though there is nothing put in to attract adults, I still found myself drawn to the screen and fully immersed in the story. The movie's secret is brutal honesty with regard to the plot and the characters. The story and the characters are very upfront with their feelings/intentions etc. but that makes them all the more endearing.

His movies, from NAUSICAA, TOTORO, KIKI, LAPUTA, and MONONOKE to the recent HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE are all not only gorgeously rendered in terms of art, but in terms of movie-making as well. Can this man do no wrong? Not really, but it is impossible to expect everyone of his movies to always be five star marvels. His newest film, PONYO, an unashamedly family-friendly tale of a ""goldfish out of water"", is as lushly animated and alive with interesting characters as you would expect... and yet this is the first film of his which treads into ""lesser"" territory. Don't get me wrong, PONYO is not a bad movie by any means. As mentioned, it is a sight for the eyes and is as charming and adorable as TOTORO and KIKI. The problem is that the story doesn't stay afloat to satisfy anyone eager for another engrossing, in-depth plot.",2009
10,"I had heard news about this film from anime-legend Hayao Miyazaki, and I SO wanted to see it. But I was lucky enough to the film online at YouTube. After watching the film, I knew that it is another Miyazaki/Studio Ghibli classic.",2009
10,Ponyo is without a doubt one of the loveliest films I've seen. I don't think anyone with a soul can be without smiling at least once during this wonderful piece of work from the hands of animation legend Hayao Miyazaki. There is so much to love about Ponyo.,2012
8,"I'm a 24 year old male, and I'm proud to say that Ponyo is one of the cutest and most delightful movies that I've ever seen in my life. I watched the entire movie with a big, silly grin on my face. ",2010
8,"For a select few, the arrival of a new Hayao Miyazaki film is more celebrated than any of Pixar's blockbusters, and with good reason, as each of the renowned Japanese director's traditionally animated features takes upwards of three years to produce. The worlds he depicts are beautiful, teeming with life, color, and spirit, and ""Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea,"" his latest, is no exception.",2010
8,"Like the 5-year old protagonists of his latest opus, Hayao Miyazaki's ""Ponyo"" enchants with its unbridled innocence as though the anime-meister has become a child himself in weaving a narrative that relishes in its simplicity and emits an infectious charm in the process. Miyazaki, recalling his earlier works, paints a brightly-colored world obviously geared for the younger audiences and the raw effervescence gleefully strips off the grim thematic elements that distinguish its immediate predecessors.",2009
8,"I have been reading a lot of different opinions and reviews of this movie, and I understand why a lot of people get mixed feelings about Ponyo, whether it be the story line, animation, dialogue, and so forth. And I believe the most simple way I can answer to this, is that it's a movie for a much, much younger age bracket. An age bracket much younger than that of Tonarino Totoro (My Neighbor Totoro).",2009

As there suddenly appears Capricorn (Andy Serkis) and Basta (Jamie Foreman), two nasties, and Dustfinger (Paul Bettany), a fire-eater. Now, 10 years later Meggie (Eliza Bennett) discovers the truth and she also has supernatural powers .

7,"This was a very enjoyable film; maybe not as exciting and a bit more contrived than I'd been looking forward to, but it was still very enjoyable in the main.",2008
8,"Let me begin by saying I have read the book and most of the second. When I saw the trailer, there were so many elements I could not place that I presumed this film would be some combination of all three books, and almost did not see it as I had not yet read the last book. I'm glad I did not succumb to this temptation.",2009
7,"Cornelia Funke is my favourite author and so I was nervous about the transfer to the screen. I knew there would be inevitable cuts and changes, which could take the heart out of the story. The actors (with the exception of Helen Mirren) didn't match what I had in my head. Could they capture the in depth personalities? ",2008
8,"I must say that I am always pleasantly surprised to watch a film without expectations, or the tiniest shred of knowledge, and be completely immersed in its world. With the new fantasy adventure film Inkheart, I experienced just that. Iain Softley's cinematic adaptation of the best-selling novel by Cornelia Funke is a fun and endearing trip. I liken the story to the Neverending Story only inverted. Rather than a boy reading a book and transporting himself into it, the characters here read the book and bring both the protagonists and antagonists to them. There is of course one caveat, for whatever comes through to Earth, something must go into the book to replace it. Said replacement being our lead's wife shows that there will be a fight for her return and the banishment of those brought over, back to the written word.",2009
4,"I was really excited about the release of this movie as I think the Inkheart books are some of the best YA fiction around. The books are dark and suspenseful and filled with twists and surprises. The books are not funny or light hearted; children are killed, men die, women lament, and evil is very very threatening and scary. The characters likewise are complex (for YA literature) and provide much in the way complex behaviour. And you can't guess the ending unless you're really clever (which I, sadly, am not). I couldn't stop reading these books and finished them off in a week.",2009
7,"""Inkheart"" is based on Cornelia Funke's novel about a character who can bring anything or anyone he reads in books to life. Teenage girls with ""Harry Potter"" and ""Twilight"" posters on their walls I assume are already trying to figure out how to harness this incredible power. Fantasy is in with the kids so all indications point to ""Inkheart"" being a big success. And why shouldn't it? All the elements are there for an entertaining movie, including Brendan Fraser again walking into the adventurer role and having it fit like white on rice. I've not read Funke's book but I can imagine its been packed down for a better flow but screenwriter David Lindsay-Abaire always keeps track of the message and director Ian Softley does a nice job of keeping things moving.",2009
10,"If you go to see this film with an open mind about it, then you're going to enjoy it as much as I did. If you watch it and are nitpicking all the way through, you're not going to enjoy it.",2008
8,"Let's face it, it's tough to write a screenplay for a novel as intricately woven as ""Inkheart."" Some scenes were cut that should have been included and some sections were changed entirely. But isn't it the characters that count? Their development and how true they are to the original work? In that regard, this movie is amazing! Everyone, except for perhaps Basta, was exactly as I pictured, with star performances by the leading cast. Watching Dustfinger blow fire into his fingertips and listening to Mo's voice while he reads treasure from ""Arabian Nights?"" It sent shivers up my spine to actually be watching one of my favorite books come alive on screen. And honestly, if we don't give this movie a chance than we're squashing any hopes of ever seeing ""Inkdeath"" on the big screen. Come on people, give ""Inkheart"" a chance!",2009

9,"Went to watch this film last night, now I'm not a big fan of Brendan Fraser but I enjoyed him in this film, he plays a loving father who just wants to protect his little girl, don't worry I haven't given anything at all away about this film. The acting was very good, the story was very Walt Disney which I love when watching a fantasy film, the cast isn't full of good looking stars but at the end of the day what Fantasy films are? If you love watching your children smile when watching a film then go and see it but also if you're an adult who loves a little bit of romance then go and watch this film, you'll understand why I said that once you have.",2008
6,"As with the majority of recent fantasy movies, Inkheart makes the mistake of catering solely to young children. Having read the book on which it was based, this is not surprising seeing as the novel IS meant for kids, but it felt like the necessity of keeping everything PG somewhat limited the creativity of the artists. A bit too fantastical and whimsical, the suspense and tension of the book almost completely disappears, leaving behind a movie that is little more than a visual effects-laden fairy tale. While some of the scenery is stunning, the sets look and feel too much like, well, sets. Nothing feels really real or, therefore, threatening enough to give the audience the sense that the characters are in real danger.",2009
6,"I only watched this movie because the trailer looked new and the idea was an interesting one. I liked the movie but throughout the first half, you get the feeling that there is something big coming up and you just can't wait till it does. The ending was quite satisfactory considering what happens.",2009
5,  Inkheart was not quite as good as I had hoped and I really did hope. ,2009

8,"When I saw the first trailer from ""Inkheart"", I thought that it was going to be a dumb fantasy film just like that unfunny comedy with Adam Sandler, ""Bedtime Stories"". And also, it was directed by Ian Softley, the director of the atrocious drama ""K-Pax"". Fortunately, ""Inkheart"" was a quite enjoyable fantasy, with an interesting premise and likable (if not very original characters) While the performances and the visual aspect of this movie are just adequate, it's the funny and charming story that makes this work. I must confess that I've never read the original ""Inkheart"" books by Cornelia Funke, but this made me interested into reading them. ",2010
6,"Oh, Brendan Fraser. How does one actor make so many movies that almost work but don't? He's been in a few brilliant films, a few god-awful ones, but the majority of them fall into an ever-widening pool of narrow misses.",2010
6,"It's an interesting premise to begin with, having the power to bring to life characters and events to the real world by just reading relevant passages. I can figure it out already, where to get fame and fortune from the right literature to read out loud.

9,"Just started watching this one this week. I have started at season 1 even though I hear you don't need it to be able to enjoy the new series. This show is so well made though, I am exceedingly impressed more with each episode I watch. There is just this building story that is getting bigger the more new characters we are introduced to. If you have seen the Shield, and the Wire already, then this should be your next stop. ",2014
9,"I really can't say enough good things about this show. Each season we are introduced to a whole new cast of characters and series of events spanning over roughly a decade for each series. The show does a beautiful job of spanning over several years without feeling like anything is rushed or left out. Each episode feels like a mini saga of it's own, with new challenges and conflicts facing the characters that it focuses on. We watch characters grow from amateurs to professionals in a matter of episodes and it all feels very real. Also, as we see at the beginning of each episode, it is all based on real events. A quick search on the Internet will reveal that almost all characters and events are very close to their real counterparts. I could go on about the attention to detail in the story lines and the the top notch acting all around but you should just watch and see for yourself.",2013
8,i thought this might be quite rushed. However I disagree with other comments here..,2008
10,"As a rule although I love many an Australian actor I usually hate the writing/production. Underbelly has changed all of that for me and I'll be revisiting some other Aussie dramas that previously I've written off. The acting is great, the soundtrack is really great, the writing makes the whole story easy to follow. I'm seriously impressed and can't wait to see the last few episodes. I've got the book and the mini series is fairly accurate, but it's important to remember that this is a dramatization and not a doco so some differences are to be expected. roberta is a crack up. alex dimitriades as Mr T, hooooooooot. Dino Dibra, wasn't until I looked on here and saw he was on h&a that I figured out who on H&A and why he was so familiar, very impressive. you *SHOULD* watch it.",2008
8,"Just wanted to respond to some people's comments on how bad Underbelly is, well it completely hooked me in! I was quite hesitant at first because I often don't go for Aussie dramas, but saw half of the first episode by chance and am officially addicted.",2008
9,"This is no easy subject to film and is still restricted in its distribution in Australia due to possible legal issues. I found it excellent. The cast is necessarily large and the acting exceptional. The gangsters really look evil and the blend of drugs, excessive sex and violence gives a chilling insight into this nether world of gangland culture. It is shot on location in Melbourne. The case is well known locally and despite it being a dramatization it runs more like a real life fly-on-the-wall documentary. For me it out Sopranoed the Sopranos and is one of the best gangster films Australia has ever produced. See it if you can. I watched all 13 episodes straight through!!",2008
9,The connection between Sopranos and this series is not far-fetched. Like that show it shows a life of crime and how these gangsters deal with their family. After having seen five episodes more depth is shown and it gets real clear that things will get very nasty indeed. The acting by the cast is superb. And it was good to see Calvan Mulvey (Heartbreak High) return in a much more mature role. What I liked especially in this show that it doesn't exactly choose sides. It is not just about the police getting the bad guys. They also show that even the gangsters have their morals and aren't entirely evil as most people would have us believe. But it doesn't glamorize the life of crime either. When necessary it does show the impact of the crimes committed. Excellent show!,2008
8,"I loved watching every episode of the underbelly series. The moment you finish one episode, you cant help yourself but to start the next one. Amongst all the characters being played my favorite was Alphonse Gangitano played by Vince Colismo. He was too good. The series picks up momentum again with the introduction of Benji. I loved performance of Gyton Grantley throughout the series portraying Carl Williams. I recommend watching this to all. In all it is a great fun.The series is like a ticking time bomb and gets you involved with every episode. Though a lot of characters were in and out at short intervals, my personal opinion is the characters of Alphonse Gangitano, Jason Moran, Carl Williams, Roberta Williams, Benji were portrayed very well.",2008
10,"This show is incredible! It is amazingly entertaining.. The best modern crime show ever. Its all true. compare Underbelly to Sopranos? lol come on. Underbelly makes the Sopranos look like p*ssy non-amusing bs. One of my favorite shows because its just flat out entertaining. DirectTV has a little hidden gem. Wonderful writing, crazy characters and wild True stories. It is not for everyone. It's the most gritty show I've ever seen. Where did this show come from? I need it on DVD. It's as well made as an HBO or Showtime show. Mark ""Chopper"" Read makes an appearance. The Kane brothers are deep in the plot. Australia has some great crime stories. This show is far better than The Sopranos. I only compare the two because someone else did. The acting is swell, the directing is fine, the art direction and cinematography are exceptional. If one has the chance to watch this show. Give it a whirl if your not faint hearted. Wildly entertaining. I really can't say enough or too much about Underbelly, you got to check it out. If you like crime shows, this is for you.",2010
10,"Plenty has been written elsewhere on this site about ""Underbelly"" so there is no need for me to detail the plot or the relationship to real events. My purpose is to comment on the other commentaries. A few years ago, Screen time produced a mini-series based on the Bryce Courtenay novel ""Jessica"". It was aired on the 10 Network in Australia, presumably to boost their Australian drama quota. It bombed despite being of excellent quality. The reason was that the Ten Network audience has different expectations from the ABC audience. The same applies to ""Underbelly"". Though it has certainly rated well and is the talk of the office every Thursday morning, I can't help feeling that it would have been even more appreciated by those whose dials are rusted on to the ABC. Those who have commented here about low production values and those who have compared the show to ""The Sopranos"" give away their expectations as typical Nine Network viewers. They like slick, tightly scripted programs, typically produced by American networks. Thank heavens ""Underbelly"" didn't get the ""Days of Our Lives"" treatment. I feel that I know the characters in ""Underbelly"". The incidents and the people are straight out of the national news bulletins. This is a dramatised documentary in many ways. ""The Sopranos"", popular though it may be, is candy-coated fiction in comparison. Give me reality, rough with warts, any day.",2008
10,Now firstly I can't help but to roll my eyes at reviewers slating the series having not watched the whole series! I can think of plenty of series that didn't grip me with the first episodes but I gave it a go & it was splendid.,2008
10,"First of all I am a Sopranos fanatic of the highest order, I've bought all the DVDs for all seasons. Hence with such a ""refined"" palate for the genre I really didn't have high expectations of this Aussie program. In fact when TV3 screened it earlier this year (or was it last year?) here in NZ, I missed it. I caught up with the recent rerun on the same TV channel (also bought the DVD). And boy! I'm glad I did because it is absolutely fantastic... Now, I saw a few ""nah, it ain't all that"" comments here but as 1)a Kiwi who is very frugal with any praise directed at anything or anybody Australian and 2)an out and out Sopranos fanatic I'll tell you this is one awesome show, right up there with the Sopranos. If anything, I think it's even better especially with its ""life is even more mind-bogglingly stranger than fiction"" story. Full credit to the film crew and sound editor; they nailed some emotionally- moving scenes with the cinematography and soundtrack. Underbelly is the only Mafia-style program/movie that has moved me to tears because of its poignant moments of futility, stupidity and sorrow. Bravo!!!",2009
9,"Solid Aussie drama. All actors in good form, but top marks go to to Kat, who plays Roberta - hilarious. Vince Colosimo as the Black Prince was also a standout.",2008
8,"Underbelly is Australia's answer to The Sopranos, obviously due to The Sopranos being a HBO show with a much larger budget and scope, Underbelly is always going to seem lower-budget to it. Underbelly however, with its smaller budget has more to go by in terms of value and authenticity. Whilst The Sopranos is based on a real Mafia Crime family based out of New Jersey named the DeCavalcante Crime Family, however it only uses this as the basis for the show and not follow real-life events of the its real counter-part.",2010
10,"OK, Underbelly is banned in part of Australia(Victoria) and I'm not going into any of the details, so just forget the hype surrounding this show and look at it for what it is.",2008
8,"IMDb should actually have separate entries for each series, rather than filing in it as one show with three seasons. Each ""season"" is a separate crime story, set in a different era with different characters. My review of 8/10 is simply for season 1. The first season was a fascinating story and the series was fairly well put together, though it did become a fraction ""soapie"" at some points. Nonetheless, the tone set by the acting was well conceived and the accuracy was pretty much there, even though a few events and aspects were simplified. ",2010

10,"As a former Marine who was deployed to the same place at the same time, I think this show did an excellent job of capturing the 'essence' of what the invasion of Iraq was like to the men who were there. This show comes closer to accurately portraying wartime Marines than any other show I've ever seen. I think this is as close as Hollywood can get short of being there and filming it live. Sometimes the special effects are a little over the top, but the dress, demeanor and dialog of the characters are very accurate.",2008
10,"Honest look at what went on in America's war for ""Iraqi Freedom"". The series is from the point of view of First Recon Marines. It gives us a realistic look of modern warfare, the combat is the most authentic i have come across, it doesn't hype the action for cinematic values. Be warned you won't get to see much of action but when it happens it's tense. ",2015
10,Brilliant war drama.,2015
9,"Every Marine that I know who's read this book, and the couple that have caught the first episode has nothing but good things to say about the material. David Simon and Ed Burns did a great job of sticking to the heart of Wright's story--and from what I've heard, even referenced Lt. Fick's personal account (One Bullet Away)--of that deployment as well. As an active duty Sergeant in the USMC, most of my enlistment has involved working with and managing the same kind of colorful personalities seen in GK. I lost track of how many times we laughed at random ""unfunny"" scenes because the accuracy of the mannerisms, terminology, or situations depicted.",2008
10,"I'm also glad there is no music. Music (though moving) would have taken away the grit to this story and given it a more artificial feel. It's amazing how much of the dialog and situations are straight from the book, and how perfectly spot on they are showing Recon Marine culture.",2008
10,"Before some one comments on this mini-series they have to understand that is based entirely in truth. I first picked up the book while I was traveling home on leave shortly after returning from Iraq and read it in one sitting on the plane. One of the things that I find to be the most outstanding about the book and the series so far is that it is true to the people. I don't mean that it gives us something new and authentic to ponder. I can't think of any instance where the book or show goes into the political aspect of Iraq. And you know why. Because Marines don't make policy. They enforce it, regardless of there personal feelings towards it.",2008
10,"I enjoyed this immensely, and without revealing my views on the war on Iraq, I must say that I fail to see where these anti-war propaganda/war mongering commentaries are relevant.",2008
10,"I had heard of ""Generation Kill"" when it premiered in 2008, but was unable to view since I do not have HBO. So I forgot about it for a while until some time ago I was looking around at the local library when I just happened to sight this little, television masterpiece, and decided, especially in light of what the result of our adventure in Iraq has been in the last few years, to give it a chance. And though I can't say ""Generation Kill"" was necessarily my favorite viewing experience, I'm glad I did. Based off of the memoirs of a Rolling Stone reporter embedded with the 1st Marine Recon Unit during the first days of the US invasion of Iraq, it begins on the eve of that faithful event by introducing the viewer to the men of 1st Marine Recon (many of whom are based off of real life Marines), their code, standards, and every day experience. When they learn that the invasion is going ahead, they also learn that a reporter from Rolling Stone will be coming with them. Initially reluctant to having a greenhorn tag along with them, they warm up to the young writer when they learn he used to write for Penthouse, a magazine many of these young, red blooded males are familiar with! Through the production, we see the course of events through the eyes of the Marines and their ""hang around"" in a the most unsugar coated method possible, and we come away with no illusions about what war is really like.",2016
8,"First off, viewers should realize that this series is about a marine recon team. This is not about the army, navy, air force, etc. Most armed forces members will tell you that the people in the Marines are a different breed from other members. They are often by nature, more aggressive, angry, patriotic, racist, need to prove something, excited to kill something, etc. If you get annoyed by that, then don't watch Generation Kill. Regardless, the series is good because, although the series isn't a deep philosophical ""thin red line"",(judging by the demeanor and mentality of a lot of the soldiers in the film it would seem a bit unrealistic), it is an honest portrayal of the mindset, expectations, and mentality of these specific groups of soldiers. Another strong point is the relatively lack of action. This is also an honest portrayal. Much of war is 95% of sitting around, doing random chores, getting bored out of your mind, mixed in with 5% of terror and serious fighting which can shake anyone's mental foundation and nerves. . I feel this series captured this rather well.",2008
8,"The USMC recon environment seems a lot like pretty much any organization: Understaffed, with the most complex decisions being dropped on the shoulders of unknown middle managers who can have their career terminated by a single error. Upper management has to juggle with the demands of hands-off managers with little understanding of the ""battlefield"" and the unpleasant task of making calls that are going to earn them no friends. Toss in with that the unavoidable reality of some commanders who might even just have one bad day - or make a snap judgment based on incomplete information, only to realize with horror what they wish they had known.",2008
9,"What can I say? In the first episode I saw great and (for the most part) realistic dialogue, excellent acting, good character development, and an avoidance of most clichés. I especially liked how this episode did not give any kind of glorified look at the heroes of this miniseries; the characters are ordinary people, trained to kill. Because of this, we see people who are unapologetic in their views of the enemy and each other. They are trained to kill, and thank God for that and for them. If we did not have people like that working for us, I doubt any of us would be here posting messages on a website. As a former soldier, I cannot wait to see the rest of this series.",2008
9,"I have been reading reviews on this site for quite a while, and decided to register so I could review this show. I think this might be the best representation of what goes on in the military for a long time, as for the last person who made a review that I read, you have no idea what you are talking about. This show seems quite real, not that I'd really know as I have never served in the military. They gay jokes, the get some, however you want to say it, is as real as it gets, this is a representation of HOW IT IS. From your review I don't even know why you would watch a show like this, maybe you should stick to watching CSI. Like I said, I have never served in the military, but my best friend was in the marines, and from what he told me, this show is as close as it gets. I found it extremely entertaining, it had no bullshit, it made me feel as thought I was watching real footage of Iraq combat from you tube. I'm not saying I agree with the war in Iraq, but be thankful we got bastards like this fighting, because without them we would be fighting ourselves, and most of you would be hiding at your grandmas house playing call of duty 4, and this is coming from a Canadian, god bless all Marines. Good damn show.",2008
10,"Saw the first three episodes of this on cable whilst on holiday, and hope it comes to the UK very soon so that I can see the rest. I also saw part of the 'Making of...' documentary, and many of the production team where a) female and b)British. They've done a really excellent job of portraying the atmosphere of war-torn Iraq, and have not compromised the performances by trying to tone down the language and jingoistic views of many of the characters. Heart pounding action whilst transiting the first town when the convoy comes under fire for the first time, and euphoria when they emerge at the far side largely unscathed. Brilliant. Well done. A really fine piece of work. Snap it up BBC.......please!",2008
9,"I have read in other comments that this TV show was full of clichés. And yes, it is. But I guess any army is full of clichés. I don't like movies like ""the red thin line"", because the characters look more philosophers rather than soldiers. What I liked more from this show is that it is constantly pointed out the question ¿who are the civilized people? Summarazing, there are lots of reasons to watch this show. The other thing it is pointed out is the lack of concerns about the iraqi people. The command seems to be ""In case of doubt, just blow up everything"". It is not true this work don't care about the Iraq people, but they are showing the point of view of a US marine platoon, and they have to show them as they are. Sorry for my English.",2008
10,"""Generation Kill"" is a really good miniseries even though i have only seen the first four episodes so far. I've seen about half of the series and every week all I'm waiting for is 9:00 on Sunday so that i can watch the next episode. ",2008
3,"Well, clearly I am in the minority here...",2009
9,"I had previously rated 'Generation Kill' a 9, from viewing the first episode. Based on past experiences (but not counting the fact that this was on HBO), I expected the rating to go down to an 8. This was not the case. 'Generation Kill' was great throughout. It was the typical HBO program, and shows what HBO is known for: realistic storytelling, consistent characters, and excellent writing and directing.",2008
4,"I really wanted to like this series. As a fan of gritty boots-on- the-ground war movies, Generation Kill sounded like a wet dream. So it was advertised, with warnings of ""disturbing content"". However, it fails miserably. This is due to a total lack of dramatic tension, and the very minimal stock battle scenes. Nothing really happens, it feels very gimmicky in that it makes you think that some shit's gonna fly, and to your great disappointment, nothing happens (like in Game of Thrones!). So I thought OK maybe if there were some good banter dialogue between soldiers, but no, it's mainly stereotypical trite spoken by colorless characters who you couldn't have given two shits about if they lived or died. How droll. Main battles are always only talked about, happening elsewhere and the actual battle scenes were sparse and hardly of any consequence at all, lacking any tension or suspense, which I think are two key elements in any good war production. The most gripping moment was probably when a soldier took some unauthorized shots at a camel (not even joking). What a sham. This is nothing other than a Hollywood executive's version of war, filled with inconsequential talk talk talk, driving around in the desert, a LITTLE shooting, more driving, then back to the talk talk talk, yada yada yada. I am only giving it stars for the good production values. I just spent two days watching this, hoping for something that never happens. I really feel cheated. What a waste of my time.",2017
10,"When i first saw the trailer to this show, i got excited seeing marines in full battle gear in armored vehicles, ready to get into action. It looked awesome and spectacular though the vulgarity and some of the characters' insensitive and racist comments rubbed me the wrong way. I half expected it to be a show that was as cliché as other 'iraq war' shows or something that was vulgar and depicted the U.S troops as superior and uncaring. When i watched the show however, it was totally different from what i expected. ",2010
10,"HBO has used its experience from former TV-series such as ""Band of Brothers"" to produce this fine seven-episode series about the war in Iraq. As in many HBO-productions it appears that the budget was near to infinite, which means that the viewer does not end up with bad special effects or a general feeling of ""hey, why aren't there cool gadgets in it?"".",2009
9,"I watched the finale of this show last night and was left feeling delighted by another great series from The Wire creators, but also very much wanting to see more from the superb cast and production team. Having said that though, the contents of the 7 episode series is more than enough for viewers to appreciate the best fictionalisation of the war in Iraq so far.",2008
5,"In order to truly get a feel for this series, one needs to see all seven of the episodes (each of which tops 60 min), preferably in as few sittings as possible. That's nearly eight hours of plot that boils down to this:",2008
9,"After reading some of the outlandish bad reviews, I had to comment on this film. I know people's perceptions differ, but some of the bad reviews are so exaggerated and are, lack of a better word, incorrect! I was hesitant about going to see just another generic man and dog film. It was my girlfriend's idea, and I figured it would be another corny chick flick about how a couple get a dog and how it brings them together. After I began watching, it grabbed my attention and never let go! I don't think my review of this film will be able to capture the true essence and emotions this film captures, but here goes: The film was very gripping in its realistic portrayal of the development of a family and their pet from the couple's wedding until the film's end approximately 40 years into their lives. I think for most people, the couple's relationship and even a troublesome pet will seem familiar(imperfect, but yet believable). The movie isn't solely about the dog, but how the dog is a bit of a nuisance at first, but matures along with the family. Giving many more details may ruin the story, so I'll hit some of the points that need attention.",2009
8,"When I first saw the previews for Marley and Me, I thought, ugh, another desperate attempt by Jennifer Aniston to resuscitate her career. I used to be a huge Aniston fan back in the ""Friends"" days, but it's been years since I've seen any of her movies. And as for Owen Wilson, he always seemed like a goof who rode on the wave of his older brother's success. This movie proved me wrong on both counts.",2008
9,"Every year I go to see a movie on Christmas Day. It's been a tradition since high school. This year's Christmas movie was ""Marley & Me"". I was more excited by the fact that it was something that everyone could go and see; including my mom, who doesn't venture out to the theater very often. Anyway, I was happy that she and my girlfriend were excited to see this.",2008
8,"Though I wasn't quite sure what to expect with ""Marley and Me"", I admit I basically expected it to be a slightly goofy slapstick type comedy centered around a high-strung pooch. I was thinking ""Beethoven"" just replace the St. Bernard with a Labrador.",2009
7,"""Marley and Me"", for what it's worth, is a true family film. The first half, with cute puppies and slap stick humor, will probably draw in the younger audiences, while the last half, a surprisingly substance filled story of a marriage growing past its prime, will appeal to the parents. The inevitable last bit will hit it home for everyone. Even teenagers. I know because I am one. That really is a 'family' film.",2009
9,"Adapted from John Grogan's debut bestselling book, Marley & Me is a painfully realistic portrayal of life and death as seen through the relationship of a young writer ""John Grogan"" (Owen Wilson) and his loyal Labrador retriever companion Marley.",2008
10,"...bring a box of tissues, because those who have loved and eventually had to make the painful decision of letting our best friends go this movie will touch a nerve, and remind us all why we love our pets.",2008
9,I read Marley & Me several years ago and was happy to see a movie was coming out. The initial critic's reviews I read made it sound like a weak movie. They were wrong.,2009
8,"You know, minutes before going to the theater to see this movie I was getting dressed and my beagle was jumping all over me, biting me and I kept pushing her away. So I go to this movie and I just couldn't help it. I cried my eyes out. How true it is, that a dog doesn't care who you are, if you're rich or poor, if you're tall or short. He's always there for you. No matter what. And no matter how big the mess is, you'll still love him. It was great to see Owen Wilson playing a dramatic role. He did great in Behind Enemy Lines and he should play more roles like this. Jennifer Aniston was great too, she really delivered. Good film, funny and entertaining, excellent for the family. Don't forget to take your dog.",2009
8,"Wonderful movie about life as the characters played by Jennifer Anniston and Owen Wilson get married and start their life together with the ""most stupidest dog in the world"". Lots of laughs in this movie but also as the story unfolds with the Grogan's careers and family they all love their dog ""Marley"".",2008
9,"I read John Grogan's book on Xmas Day 2007 & saw this film today in Australia on New Years Day '09. I have to say they have turned this heartwarming & funny story into a great movie. The casting was right & Owen Wilson & Jennifer Anniston perfect in the roles of John & Jenny Grogan. I grew up as a teenager with a Golden Labrador in the family we all adored & in my early married life with a badly behaved Lassie Collie dog which had to be put down 13 years later. I could really relate to this family's experiences with their pooch & the sometimes angst it caused them. Our Collie chewed everything in sight & also managed to run straight through a plate glass door, jumped out of the car window and broke a bone in his foot... so many experiences similar to this film/book. And at the end of our pooch's life my (by then ex-husband) cried like a baby when we had to have our dog put down.",2009
10,"This isn't just a film about a wild and untrained dog who does silly gags that we've seen before. This is a movie about the cycle of life and how life if often not what we expect. Through the introduction of the dog, Marley, we see how the characters grow and adapt and finally we see exactly how unimportant all those things we thought were so crucial really are.",2008
10,"This heartwarming saga of the most incorrigible dog ever captured on film is excellent family entertainment, although parents should keep in mind very young children may be disturbed by the heartbreaking ending, which had grown men - myself included - sobbing out loud after laughing hysterically for 90 minutes. Jennifer Aniston is as charming as ever, and Owen Wilson manages to subdue his frequently snide and wise-alecky persona long enough to offer an outstanding performance. This isn't just the story of a dog with behavior problems; it's a charming portrait of a marriage as the couple navigates their way through life while dealing with tragedy, financial difficulties, and the joys and frustrations of parenthood, in addition to that very energetic and lovable yellow Lab.",2008
10,"After Christmas Dinner last night, my family members decided that it would be a good idea to go see this movie. A few of them had read the book and loved it. Feeling obligated to family, I of course went to go see it with them. However, my expectations for it were fairly low to be honest. I'm not a big fan of Jennifer Aniston's work and while funny, I feel that Owen Wilson is only capable of playing himself in the movie roles he's taken on. The same could probably be said for Jennifer Aniston to a degree as well.",2008
7,"Wild horses couldn't have dragged me to the theaters to see this movie but I couldn't say no to my nieces and they are the ones that selected the DVD. What a surprise and how dangerous to pre-judge. ""Marley and Me"" has, at least, 4 or 5 elements that put it way above other movies of its kind. It reminded me (without being similar) to a favorite of my own childhood ""Old Yeller"" and that alone placed me on a very special frame of mind. Jennifer Aniston surprised me. Her performance feels and sounds truthful and thoughtful. The mother of three who left behind a promising career to dedicate herself fully to her family, reeks of a familiar kind of pathology that Aniston takes all the way without allowing the acting get in the way. I believed her and that makes things work on all levels. Then, Alan Arkin, he creates a fully fledged character out of a clichè. He's wonderful. And Marley? The series of extraordinary dogs who played the arch of this unconventional creature, is a triumph of sorts. Some of the music and Marley running I could have done without and I must confess I wouldn't have cast Owen Wilson but that's just too small a problem to spoil the surprise this movie provides. Kathleen Turner plays a cameo as a dog instructor that provoked a gasp in the audience. She's closer to Shirley Stoler in ""Seven Beauties"" than to Geena Davis in ""The Accidental Turist"" Use your kids as an excuse to see Marley. It works.",2009
9,Short-attention-span synopsis: Best film of the holiday season.,2008
8,"It's not too often that I break down and sob in a movie theater like I did with Marley & Me but this is no ordinary film. Sure, this isn't a movie for the jaded film goers amongst us who are looking for layers and substance filled substance to dissect and interpret. Instead it's a formulaic family flick made by dog owners for other dog owners. It's also a love letter to our best friends who are the only ones in our lives to see us at our highest and our lowest and who love us no matter what.",2008

1,"I go to a lot of movies, often I bring my 5 year old son, I am so glad I did not bring him to this one. There are many references to sex and a skinny dipping scene, however, that is not the primary reason I would not take him to it. The trailers lead you to believe it is a light-hearted comedy; nevertheless, virtually all of the funny moments are in the previews. I kept waiting for it to get interesting, funny, or anything but serious; however, I nearly fell asleep as the plot-less story dragged on. I understand that dogs can be great company, that being said, the entire story focused on a poorly behaving dog that the owners were not savvy enough to train. If a human caused this much damage and mayhem that person would be banned. The worst movie I've ever seen with Jenifer Aniston or Owen Wilson, a waste of their talent. The best way to sum up this movie is, couple gets unruly dog, couple falls in love with dog, dog dies, couple sad. The End.",2009
1,"7.2 on IMDb - you are kidding, right? Plus lots of words like heartwarming, joyful, happy - did we see the same movie? Chaos and irritating chaos at that; a dog that breaks and takes everything in sight isn't funny the first time and after the seventieth time it is just plain dire.",2009
1,"Now when i see Owen and Jenifer in the same movie i get high expectations. But this movie is the worst movie i have seen i many many years. This movie shows you a dog behaving badly for 1½ hours combined with bad performance from the actors and a story so boring you wont believe it. When i say a dog behaving badly it could seem funny for some people, but a dog eating a couch, running after other dogs, humping a leg just ain't funny anymore. Come up with something new guys! I had to stop the movie after 1 hour and 15 min. I have rated all my favorite movies on IMDb, but this is the first time i have felt the urge to rate a bad movie.",2009
1,"I have a pretty strong stomach for fairly clichéd schmaltzy feel good movies with animals in them but this movie is so totally lacking in chemistry that it's just unwatchably boring. There's no plot (unless you count ""some people get married and get a dog..."").",2009
5,"I do have a question, what ever happened to the slow walking lame Egyptian mummies? I mean, as silly as they are, they're still entertaining. Now we have The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, I loved The Mummy, The Mummy Returns, it was watchable, but this one was just an excuse to make some quick cash. I was actually looking forward to seeing this movie, I got the opportunity to see it today, I was excited, but unfortunately, we now have Chinese mummies that can do anything that will fit into the CGI budget. Another disappointment was the recasting of Evelyn, I know Rachel Weisz turned this script down, but she was seriously needed, Maria Bella, who is a decent actress, actually made Evie a very flat character and not as enjoyable. Then not only that, but we have Brendan and Maria who do look incredibly good for their age, they have a 20 year old son in the movie? This story was a waste of time and money.",2008
5,"I really like the Mummy series for its epic action, sense of humor and great special effects. I was very excited when I started seeing teasers for this sequel to be shown in July, mostly because it was quite unexpected.",2008
2,"I was able to catch this movie at a test screening in California while i was on vacation and its not much of a film. Its the same story as the previous ones and most of the stuff in the movie were taken from them as well. I love Brendan Fraser but he didn't look happy to be there and with how the story was set up, you can't blame him for looking miserable. He has no chemistry with Maria Bello, who was just awful (She's no Rachel Weisz, that's for damn sure.) and he has even less chemistry with his own son played by Luke Ford, who has the charisma and the charm of a brick, not to mention the fact that he looks just as old as both Fraser and Bello. Fraser has more chemistry with John Hannah, who is a welcome distraction from the lousiness of the film. The movie itself is just a flat headed mess of bad visual effects with no soul. Jet Li lacks the menacing presence of Arnold Vosloo from the previous films but that problem is more than less on the shoulders of the director, who was in my opinion more concern with the style of the film than any substance it could have had and because of that, Jet Li and most of the cast got the short end of the stick and it shows.",2008
1,"A true honest review? Some true honest advice? Don't waste your time on this, its terrible. ",2008
4,"Like so many great movies that became dragged-out trilogies, the newest Mummy falls right in. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely loved the first movie. But like so many sequels, this story line becomes repetitive. The first rule of sequels is to keep the cast. Rachel and Brendan and an amazing chemistry, but Maria Bello was abysmal as the new Evelyn. Her fake British accent and melodramatic acting was inexcusable. The sets looked like they were built by 3rd graders, the effects were overwhelming, the scenes were disjointed and the cheesy one-liners got old fast. Sure, Brendan Fraser still looks hot in a tux, but he still looks 35 even though his son is in his young 20s. Overall, I was terribly disappointed. I wouldn't even bother seeing it in theaters...and please tell me this series is finally over.",2008
1,"I was able to see this film about a month ago in a preview screening and to put it in kind words, its terrible. Jet Li is about the only good thing about the film but he's hardly in it. Brendan Fraser was phoning in his performance and looked if he was waiting from a call from his agent to get him out of the movie. Maria Bello looked goofy and miscast and the actor who plays their son makes Hayden Christensen from the Star Wars films look like an Oscar winner. John Hannah manages to bring some laughs to the table but his stick is not as fresh as it was before and Michelle Yeoh does not really do much with her role. This movie lacks the creepiness of the first two Mummy movies and the stone warriors of this movie don't hold a candle to the ghouls of the first two films at all. Not to mention the fact that the visual effects in this film look even worse than the second film(The Mummy Returns). The film itself seemed toned down in the fun and thrills department and just feels tired in certain scenes not to mention the dialogue, which seems like it was written by a five year old. This film seemed like a quick payday from all involved and sadly with the little effort spent in giving the audience something to root for and care for, its just feels like no one even cared about what they were making.",2008
1,"This is probably one of the worst films I've seen in my life, and I don't tend to toss around accusations like that lightly, but this third installment of The Mummy series initiated back in 1999 deserves such dishonor, cause it's such a bad example of film making, it borders on offensive.",2008
1,"I want to say up front that I loved the first two Mummy movies, so I am not a hater of this franchise. They were campy, very tongue-in-cheek, and there was this wonderful rapport between the actors which came out in their performances. I went into this one with some trepidation because much of the main cast of the first two films would not be in it (Rachel Weisz, Arnold Vosloo, Patricia Velasquez and Oded Fehr), but I figured, well, the first two were great (or at least a lot of fun), so how bad could this one be?",2008
3,Since we saw Mummy III and Hellboy II as a drive-in double bill we're doing sort of a twofer - reviewing both movies simultaneously and posting under both titles - because we discovered that we were actually watching the same movie twice. It was a fascinating way to see these films; giving us the opportunity to directly compare and contrast them and analyze why one succeeded and the other failed.,2008

Second, I was hoping he would do another mummy movie - I like him in these campy action movies so I was looking forward to this movie. Now I wish he had turned this one down as Rachel did, I wouldn't have wasted my money. And I have a high tolerance for so-so movies. I felt so bad for Fraser, he was trying - but you can only do so much with a crappy script and poor direction.",2008

10,"With well composed images, beautiful CGI effects and stunning locations, dynamic action sequences, and breathtaking music - this an excellent action-fantasy adventure for all ages. This movie sole goal is to entertain, and nothing else. And that's what it accomplishes.",2009
10,"I have decided that I need to start adding my comments on IMDb (which I had rarely done before) just to offset all the comments from other people that I tend not to agree with. Sure, when I see a solid 7 or 8 on IMDb, the movie seems to warrant that type of score, but lately I've been seeing a lot of movies that are not bad that are getting unfairly hammered on their scores. On average I probably watch over 300 movies a year - now that doesn't give me a Masters degree in film or whatnot, but to be able to have an opinion about an art form it doesn't take a degree. ",2009
8,"No, this Mummy doesn't come even close to topping the first one, but I would argue that it is as good or possibly even better than the second one. Yes, there are several things we can quibble about (Brendan Fraser's son looking as old as he does, abominable snowmen from out of nowhere, and a very ho-hum love story) but this movie was not made for the Oscars, people. It was made so that we could check our brains at the door and have fun, and the movie does deliver on that count.",2008
7,personally i was unsure whether i should go and see this film or not having read some very mixed reviews. however i was persuaded to go and was pleasantly surprised by what i saw! the film was quite exciting and at times unexpected .the fighting scenes were of a good quality and and it was easy to keep track of the different sides.this made a nice change compared to the usual where fights pass in a blur of weapons and fists leaving a often baffled audience unsure of who is winning! whilst watching the film it made me jump and made me laugh.all in all i think this is a very watchable film that would be enjoyed by people of all ages as long as they understand that this film was made to entertain andit wont be every ones cup of tea! i would recommend this film to anyone considering seeing it - you can make up your own mind,2008

The year is 1947, and the O'Conells have retired from mummy adventures and wartime espionage. Evelyn has released two-best selling books based on her real-life adventures (named after the previous two movies), while Ricky O'Conell tries unsuccessfully to make a living out of fly-fishing. Alex (played by Australian actor Luke Ford) is now an adult and has dropped out of school to follow the footsteps of his parents by discovering the long-lost army of Han, the Dragon Emperor. With backing from his old professor, Roger Wilson, he achieves this goal, but suddenly receives an uninvited guest in the form of a mysterious woman named Lin (Isabella Leong). Meanwhile, the older O'Connells come out of retirement to send a diamond known as the Eye of Shangri-La back to China as a gesture to maintain solid British-Chinese relations. In Shanghai, they reunite with Jonathan, who owns Imhotep, a posh nightclub named after the antagonist of the previous two films. After arriving to the museum in which Alex has moved the Dragon Emperor to, Roger Wilson double-crosses them and, with the aid of General Yang and his second-in command Choi, they bring back to life the Dragon Emperor and a new Mummy returns to claim his share of glory in the modern world.",2008

7,"When I entered the cinema today to see The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, I felt certain that I would be getting a film that was great fun to watch, didn't worry too much about the plot and was supported by some great casting. But, very rarely for me, I was wrong, on two counts. This film had all the action, and all the laughs of its predecessors, yet it certainly had the strongest plot out of all of the trilogy. On this occasion, I was glad to be wrong. However, the casting was where it all fell apart, hence why this film has earned 7 brownie points from me, rather than the 9 it would have otherwise deserved. Firstly, Maria Bello was quite possibly the worst choice for Evelyn that could possibly have been made. I noticed more chemistry between Jonathon and that yak than between Rick and Evelyn in this movie. Secondly, Luke Ford, while a decent actor, bore no family resemblance to either Brendan or Maria. By the way, did anybody else remember that in the second movie, his hair was blond? Quite a large slip up there. There were five saving graces in the cast, however: Brendan Fraser once again pulled off Rick O'Connell, Jet Li was equally as evil as his predecessor, Michelle Yeoh was astounding as Zi Yuan and John Hannah provided plenty of comic relief with his lovably irritating Jonathan. Finally, the Yetis! These were an unexpected addition that, surprisingly, worked quite well.",2008

But I've seen both previous films because my little cousin is just in love with all that pre-teen hoop-la, it's all good, every generation has something so lovey-dovey-cutesee-wootsee type of thing. But one of the things that made this film enjoyable was to see all the kids who were just participating with this film, I mean, I felt like I was in a concert, the kids were clapping with the songs, screaming for their idols, and just having fun, it was cool to see their reactions, to remember a more innocent time of being in love that much with something. But I felt like this was just a cute movie that is getting too much criticism just because it is High School Musical, give it a break and take it for what it is.",2008

6,"My only exposure to High School Musical was from a chalet gathering last Christmas where a friend who was a fan brought his DVD and shared with us what's there to like from this highly popular franchise. The DVD has countless of versions released to milk its fan base, that I've really lost count just how many variations (Encore? Extended Dance?) there are out there in the market. Even then I didn't really watch High School Musical 2 completely, only zooming into the catchy song and dance numbers, and as for the first movie, I was only familiar with one or two songs that became like anthems for working together?",2008
8,"Okay, I am 100% completely for the High School Musical franchise! Have you noticed that the majority of people who have something derogatory to say about the series are 15+. Well, duh! You were young once too and no one constantly dissed the Lion King or Cinderella or Rugrats or whatever your ""show"" was as a naive, innocent kid. Lions don't talk or dance or sing, there are no such things as ""fairy god mothers"" and talking mice, and babies don't have imaginary worlds where they can talk in front of adults, yet no one hears them. What do you want Disney to do: turn High School Musical into a movie about kids who are sexually active backstage and smoke weed after rehearsals? There's nothing wrong with a nice, innocent, family movie, people! If Disney turned High School Musical into that, you'd be complaining WAY more, trust me! And yes, High School Musical may be like a fantasy high school world that we all WISH could exist, but it's not destroying the kids' brain cells or anything. Once they get to that certain age level, they'll realize that the ""perfect, happy, HSM life"" was all an illusional element created because it's Disney. So chill.",2008

There's his girlfriend--sweet, squeaky clean Gabriella (Vanessa Hudgens) who is going to a college that is far away from Troy. Then there's Troy's best bud Chad (Corbin Bleu) who doesn't want high school to end. Then there's the evil Sharpay (Ashley Tisdale) who wants Gabriella's part in the school play.",2008
2,"I haven't seen the first nor the second film, but with films like Dirty Dancing, Footloose, even Grease in the back of my mind, it makes High School Musical 3 look like a propaganda film made by reactionary parents and the U.S. Department of Education. The film has been clinically cleansed of losers or people who are a bit unusual; and it's a great example of a pedagogical motivation-form based on fear. Fear of defeat; fear of inadequacy; fear of humiliation. There is no room for mediocrity or small ambitions; so straighten up while you are young and go to school, and ""allow yourself to be great"" as it says in the film This is the stuff anorexia and high-school massacres are made of. High School Musical makes me think of what one of the creators of South Park, Matt Stone, said about the American school system: ""They scare you into conforming. If you're a loser now, you're gonna be a loser forever."" High School Musical preaches that every moment is crucial for the rest of your life. And this is a 'wonderful' achievement pressure to put on children and adolescents. Let's take a few quotes to understand the rhetoric. In the changing room the coach says: ""Make this moment last"". Prom night is ""A night to live forever"", so one must hope one has a date that night. ""This is our last chance to get it right"", ""This is our last chance to make our mark"", ""History will know who we are,"" etc.. This is the pupils last chance to write themselves into history; and they are just 17 years old.",2008
7,"The thing about the High School Musical franchise is that you either love it or hate it. Ever since the first movie, it has always been like that. I, for one, will now be standing in the middle because I will review this film unbiasedly. I've to say, the movie was fun to watch. It has a very simple storyline, which was made complicated later on in the movie. The characters whom are now in their senior years has to choose where they have to go after they finished high school. This is the story about their hope and fears and choices they have to make. Simple enough...",2008
10,"now i liked the first one disliked the second one and loved the third one. this was much better than the first two. the film was a real musical. the film had a amazing beginning sequence. the film was way more dramatic than the first two. the film was spectacular to see in theaters. it was a real treat. it had better music sequences and songs like: the boys are back, may i have this dance, right here right now, i want it all, high school musical,and a night to remember. the film had a really good moral and plot. i loved this film. the good bie song ""high school musical,"" was a good song. the main word were ""high school musical, who says we have to let it go. high school musical celebrate were we come from."" the film deserved the 10 out of 10 i gave it. it is also completely kid appropriate.",2008
9,"Before going to see this film, you should have enjoyed the first two. If you didn't, there's absolute no reason why you should go see this one. However, between the three, this feature was obviously the best. the fact that it was released in a cinema meant they had more money to use and thus made it much more an enjoyable film to watch.",2008
2,"Once again thousands of people from all over the world ( mostly teenagers ) are going to watch this movie which lacks deeply in acting, writing and directing. This is a movie that uses colors, ""songs"", perfect conditions of living, schooling, clothing and illusional relationships that are so IMAGINARY to attract audiences as much as possible . Moreover, there is no school, no condition of life like this. Gettign everything you want and do whatever you wanna do. For me as a teenager is so sad and devastating to witness that the characters of this movie have become the role models of open minded individuals as teenagers, and starting to close their perspective of seeing life with delusions. Once again thanks to Disney cooperation for what it has done it to make money from fooling people by pretty and fancy deceptions.",2008
1,"Why does this movie exist? Why is there a series of High School Musical movies at all? They are nothing like real high school musical productions and in fact the way they present high school is nothing like high school is actually like at all! No sex, no swearing, no drugs, no alcohol, no real problems at all. Boo hoo these poor kids! What kind of ultra rich fantasy world is this where they can afford such high production values? The songs are all bland and awful. The performers are at least a little talented (most of them anyway) but nothing special and most are only in it obviously because they have a certain look or maybe know someone or maybe their parents do. The High School Musical movies are all bland and totally pointless.",2008
4,"Wow, this series has worn out its welcome. The first two installments were modest, harmless TV movies with fast-moving stories and some catchy songs. The third time was not the charm.",2008
2,"This was my first experience with anything HSM related and I regret having decided to watch this. I like musicals, so I thought there would at least be catchy songs to like. Well, there aren't. I can't see how anyone could like this unless you are a 10 year old girl. The acting is horrible, and the fake lip-singing is so awful. It doesn't even sound like their voices. Plus, the songs are horrible. The music, the lyrics, all of it. I know I never liked corny shows like this when I was a kid. I feel bad for all the parents that took their kids to the theater to see this and had to sit through it. Maybe some were smart enough to bring ear plugs and blindfolds.",2009
1,"Right, one thing to say out of the starting gate that's going to prepare those who are going to dig through this article and wonder why I gave it such a low score with all the dancing and the singing and the so on: I hate musicals. There have been 3 that I can recall at this moment that have proved otherwise, those being The Producers, My Fair Lady (Yes, My Fair Lady), and Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog.",2008
1,Disney will you please stop with this torture. i mean really how many times can we see stupid teenagers sing about Capri pants. these teens need to grow up. i want to see the one movie where they are all grown up. they submit there 401 (k)'s and do there taxes and there mortgage that is if they can get married. i swear if they make one more of this they are going to make me lose my mind up in here up in here. what would be really funny is that if they started cursing. example. ,2011
1,"I hated 1. I hated 2. I didn't even bother with 3. This movie portraits high school as a happy place where nothing ever goes wrong. It's time for a wake up call. I'm in my last mandatory year of school, and I can say it is nothing like the place shown in these movies. In my school about 3/4 of my year smoke, at least 1/4 have done drugs, constant swearing, fighting etc. When the younger children watch this movie they're going to think high school is just like it, and I would hate to be one of those children. This is, by far, the most fantasy-filled movie I've watched in a long time. Don't let the children be conned into thinking life is all singing and dancing, it isn't, and if they don't learn that now, they're going to fall. Hard.",2008
1,"well....what can i say. didn't expect much and didn't get much! my daughter who likes the first 2 movies, fidgeted all the way thru it. i drew the shortest straw with my wife when we decided who was going to take her. this movie is one of the worst i have ever sat thru....and I've seen showgirls! unbelievable plot strings, a school full of ""the beautiful people""...just total dross. even my daughter said she didn't like it. lets hope Disney don't make another, but they probably will. as long as there are young kids willing to waste their money on this rubbish, they will keep churning them out. the songs, too, were instantly forgettable, i cant recall a line or melody from a single one of them! my new worst movie of all time!",2008
10,"Okay,first thing first.If you're a musical fan,GO FOR IT !!!You'll love this movie,its very enjoyable.",2008
10,"Okay so having finally got sick of the first two, I was sooo ready for some new songs from HSM3. So under the pretext of taking my five year old sister, i went along on opening day to watch this and a packed out cinema full of little kids and their eager guardians.",2008
1,"i absolutely LOVED the first two HSM movies. this was absolutely atrocious and far below the bar they had set with the two previous made-for-TV flicks. ALL the songs sounded like songs from the previous two movies and many scenes felt like shot-for shot/line-for-line remakes. it was really, really awful. i was seriously tempted to ask for my money back, it was that bad...and i've never even considered asking for a refund at a movie before in my life. plus, it was practically an 'opera' in that there was almost no spoken dialogue. it was just musical number to musical number to musical number. a very sickening...and expensive...deja vu. avoid this as if it were the plague.",2008
8,"For anyone that did not like this movie, you are either not a musical fan, or just to old for Disney movies, or both. I mean I am 20 years old, and I will admit I am a little old for Disney movies, but I believe this was a movie worth seeing. And I personally think that it was better then the second movie because they were once again preparing for another High School Musical hence the name High School Musical, as well as preparing the end of their High School career.",2008
10,"I was going into this movie hoping it would be great and it delivered. I am a 18 yr old guy and can still say I've liked all of the HSM movies. But as to HSM 3, it started out fast paced and had me hooked. The music was great and I went and bought the soundtrack right after I left the theater. The songs have always been good, but I think they did better with the lyrics in this one. I think Zac Efron improved his acting in this film and everyone else did just as well if not better as they had before. I would love if they made a HSM 4, but only if they kept the main 6 characters/actors (Troy, Gabriella,Sharpay,Ryan,Chad,Kelsi). They all are the ones that keep me interested, though it wouldn't be right without other key people, like Mr. Bolton or Mrs. Darbus.",2008
10,"After Pride and Prejudice, Jane Eyre and this winter's Cranford, I thought that the BBC couldn't do any better: that it had reached its peak. Boy, was I wrong. I was apprehensive about watching Lark Rise because of this, but those doubt were removed immediately as I fell in love with all the characters, especially Julia Sawalha, who surpasses herself, obviously moving away from her most famous role as Lydia Bennett in Pride and Prejudice, and she does so delightfully! ",2008
9,"I have to disagree with the reviewer who says this was 'dreadful'. Film and television adaptations of ANY novel inevitably have to be stylised. I found the performances excellent, and have to pick our Julia Sawhala, unrecognisable from here Saffy days, and her presentation of the dialogue was a wonderful balance of sincerity, wit, warmth and pathos.",2008
10,"I have not read the books and so do not know how true it is to them but as a drama in itself i think that it is brilliant! There are many story lines yet they all link into one, the acting is superb and hilarious, an extremely worthwhile period drama and I am very pleased to say that my cousins who are 15 and 17 year old males, are absolutely obsessed and I am very pleased that it is appealing to such a wide range of people and educating them. Who knows, we could have them watching Jane Austen next!!!!!!!! We record it on a Sunday night and as we do not have any spare evenings until Friday night to watch it, I am practically tearing my hair to see what happens! I love this and don't want it to end!",2008
10,"The previous posters I feel are nit picking at what is one of the most glorious productions I have enjoyed in many years. Not having read the books from which the series is taken, I came to it not knowing what to expect. It is beautiful, glowing with a golden warmth, a lyrical love poem to the people and village life of England just over a century ago, making it hard to return to daily life without regret. It reminds me almost of Laurie lee's Cider with Rosie, the love with which this time and people are conveyed, the richness, glowing like late afternoon sunshine seeps into our drawing rooms as we watch and makes one long for a time and place long vanished. The heart which has been put into this production, into the performances by every member of the cast and production crew, the love portrayed, I can't find a better word for it, warms one, melting away the chill of 21st century living. The poor not dirty enough some say?! Perhaps it will surprise some to know that the poor of that time, as now, had their pride and kept as clean as circumstances would allow, which meant at least clean looking. The other users comments are churlish, this is the most lyrically beautiful, heart warming & charming series I have ever seen. The humanity and touching wisdom in the way characters are portrayed, slowing revealing the reasons for their behaviour are truly moving. Everyone involved in this production should be cheered to the rafters and begged for an encore. I hope, as do all I know also, that the screenwriters will be asked to take the series on from where the books end, and never stop giving us new tales of this golden idyll, where the community sheltered those living within it's boundaries, as an extended family does, as opposed to our dislocated times. If you watch this series, you will be fully rewarded, your only regret will be that you can't enter the screen and stay forever in Candleford. The performances by everyone are rich with humanity, pathos, comedy and utterly stunning. I have grown to love everyone that lives there and everything about Candleford, so will you. It is a joy & does one good.",2008
8,"A couple of other reviewers have complained about this series not being faithful to Flora Thompson's books - thank god for that, is all I can say. The books were among the most dreary, plodding tales I have ever read, and they left me depressed for days. I couldn't see the bucolic charm for all the squalid poverty and starving.",2008
9,"I get so tired of modern drama based around dark, cynical, unpleasant characters. Lark Rise to Candleford is so different. The characters in this little community manage to rise above their conflicts, see past each others' foibles, and support and love each other. ",2010
10,"I am really enjoying this series and do not want it to end, I believe the BBC are commissioning another series thank god. At last something to enjoy and look forward to on a Sunday night. Julia Sawahla is excellent and i really feel for her character and i hope she will be in the next series as it won't be the same. I have preordered the series from amazon and and i cannot not wait to receive it, The acting from all involved is brilliant right down to Dawn French. The set is Magnificent it almost makes you want to go back in time, the costumes especially that of the Pratt sisters are magnificent i love the way they wear the same clothes nearly all the time. Excellent and Delightful show.",2008
10,"I love period drama series, I love ""Cranford"" as it is just divine, and I have loved BBC dramas such as ""Pride and Prejudice""(1995), ""Bleak House""(2005) and ""Little Dorritt""(2008). I even love ""The Darling Buds of May"" for its sheer sense of escapism and entertainment value. You have probably already guessed I love ""Lark Rise to Candleford"", I just feel it is really entertaining, charming, beautifully made and just relaxing to watch. Like ""Cranford"", ""Lark Rise To Candleford"" whenever it is on really makes my night. The production values are exquisite; the costumes are ravishing and colourful, the sets are lavish and the scenery is gorgeous. The music is also gorgeous, I always like good music when it comes to film and television. The scripts are of exceptional quality, funny, poignant and endearing, and the direction and story lines are fine. The acting is also truly excellent, Julia Sawalha is a sheer delight especially. And she is well supported by Dawn French, Linda Bassett, Sarah Lancashire and Mark Heap. Overall, I love it, it really is the epitome of charm and heart. 10/10 Bethany Cox",2010
8,This is my first comment in this forum. I think the casting was very well done. I am torn as to whether it tops Cranford. I have to admit I have a soft spot for Cranford.,2009
9,"Am a U.S.viewer, watching Series 1 on an all-region DVD player. I ordered this series as something my elderly mother might enjoy and have become engrossed myself. Sounding initially like a British variant on LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE, CANDLEFORD turns out to be a rich spectacle which discovers complexities in itself after pleasant but lightweight opening installments and by episode 4 becomes something altogether finer (I've seen only 1-7 so far). I think it not entirely accidental that this same fourth episode engineers a lengthy hiatus for LARK SPUR's most egregious blemish, the already oft-slammed Dawn French as the hamlet's debtor-reprobate. French isn't distractingly familiar in the U.S. but her lazy anachronistic performance, straight out of the classic ""Coarse Acting"" handbook, is an irritant just the same. Might as well note the other flaws that persist, noted in the more critical IMDb critiques: the usual over-explicit music; some wobbly continuity from one episode to the next (particularly notable in the lack of carryover after the milliner-sisters' traumatic reunion with their father); the disregard for the 18 mile separation of communities so forcefully laid-out in episode 1 and subsequently ignored; and, yes, the absence of squalor. Can't comment on the adaptation's disregard for the source-book since I haven't read it. ",2009
10,I know that this is a very lengthy review but I hope you will read and enjoy it.,2009
10,"The only historical drama series I watch these days and the highlight of my week. Every character is blessed with a real actor or actress. All perfectly cast, except one. One glance tells more stories than some of the shallower pedants are even capable of noticing. Dawn French alone was dire beyond words. As out of place as a full grown hippo in a pet shop. I would cheerfully have had her hung or transported! Or harpooned! The rest are truly delightful, albeit too freshly laundered. Where is the constant rain and inevitable mud of rural living, both then and now? Nevertheless, I hope this series runs forever. It goes down like a rich, warm sherry with very similar effects. Bravo to all concerned!",2010
10,"Oh, the humanity!! JUST imagine!!! A thoroughly entertaining & popular series based loosely on a book. Boo Hoo! ",2010
9,"I'm a 40 year old straight single guy. I would have never even considered watching something like this if someone described it to me or I saw a commercial for it. BUT, the only channel we got clearly at my family's lake house was PBS until the digital transition. After fishing and doing yard work one day, I was drinking a beer and was too tired to get up to change the channel when this came on. I was a little angry at first, but after about 15 minutes I realized that I really wanted to know what happened next to this lady. I ended up watching the whole thing and realized at the end that I had laughed a few times and even welled up with tears once. And I don't think it was from the beer! I watched two more full episodes when I went back to the lake (kind of looked forward to it). I think I need to let me ego heal for a little while before I watch any more, but just had to say that this show has incredible acting, writing, scenery, authenticity to the place and period, and much more. If you grew up watching Little House on the Prairie, you'd really like this (as another reviewer mentioned). Same overall feel, but much more complex stories and more mature themes. I usually don't quite have that willing suspension of disbelief required for something like this, but it is so well done I feel like I'm sitting in the room with them in 19th century England... as if any moment someone will turn toward me and ask if I'd like a spot of tea! Give it 15 minutes and you'll probably be hooked too. Okay, I better go hammer a few nails or work on my car for a while!",2011
10,This series is absolutely the finest set of programmes I have ever seen on British TV in all my years of watching.,2013
8,"I've just finished watching season 1 of this series and, to cut to the chase, I'm not impressed. The acting was usually tolerable - Julia Sawalha and Olivia Grant were clear stand-outs and a pleasure to watch. The other actors have my pity: almost all the characters have been denied the basic right and necessity to develop and create depth. The writers and producers of this series (the first season, at least) should to go back to film school or pick up a history book to learn that 19th century life had far more meaningful worries than a lost parcel or teenage love triangles. ",2013
7,"Harmless fun sums it up really, and nice to look at; ideal Sunday night untaxing stuff really. It bears little or no relationship to the books although if it gets people reading them that can only be a good thing. Dawn French lives down to all expectations; the Mrs Arless of the books was a slightly aloof and mysterious figure as I recall, from a different background to the other hamlet women, not a knockabout drunken clown. The accents are interesting too; the only one who has anything approximating to the correct accent for the area is Queenie's husband. I swear that in the first scene in which he appeared, Laura's father had a Scots accent. Pedant Alert: One thing, Lark Rise is based on Juniper Hill in North Oxfordshire near the Northamptonshire border. It is NOT in the Cotswolds. Candleford seems to have been based on a hybrid of nearby towns like Bicester and Banbury.",2008
6,"If you like your drama extremely light and with almost consistent happy endings, you will love this. This show is very, very easy to watch and is about as deep as a puddle of water. Rather like 'Darling Buds of May' or 'House of Elliot'. Very strawberries-and-cream. It is fine evening television entertainment with a plot that even children could follow. I have never heard of the title before and did not realise it is based on a set of novels. From what other poster's have commented, it would appear this television version bares no resemblance to the novels, but that is of little consequence, as it clearly does not aim to be. I prefer my drama (period pieces or otherwise) to be more real and gritty than this, but I still thoroughly enjoyed it, for what it is.",2009
10,"Although I thoroughly enjoyed watching this series, there are a few, shall we say technical details that bothered me throughout all 4 seasons. In the first episode we find that Lark Rise and Candleford are separated by something over 8 miles of road. A bit less if you cut through the fields however the walking time in either case would be about 3 hours each way. Through all of the episodes we see people moving between the communities as if they were only minutes apart. How did they move about so quickly? My other observation is that although Lark Rise is obviously a farming community, we never see any farm animals. Once there was a chicken on Twister's roof, Sydney's goose and of course there was Queenie's Berkshire pig in season-4, but no real farm animals. They always had lots of stews and sausages to eat though. These technical oversights always bother me, it is my one weakness...",2012
9,"""Lark Rise to Candleford"" was an unexpected pleasure to watch for my wife and I over the past several months, and we are sad that we have no more episodes to enjoy. We came across the series after getting interested in ""Downton Abbey"", and I was pleased to find in ""Larkrise"" a period-piece show which was relatively free of intense drama (my wife likes ""calm"" shows).",2014
10,"I have so enjoyed this period drama that its ending bought with it a touch of sadness that we don't live like this today.... what a shame! I do hope more of these kind of period drama's will be made for TV. I loved the characters and village life with its warmth, gentleness, and moments of laughter with its amusing anecdotes. The only thing I did not enjoy was Olivia Hallinan acting as the young Laura Timmins, I felt her acting was overdone as if she was trying too hard to portray an innocent gentle young girl of that era, but instead she seemed to come across as quite conceited, as if she had an excessive estimate of her own importance. There were many times while walking with a friend or young man in some scenes that she had this odd trait of slightly shaking her head from side to side which looked ridiculous and she spoke to some people as if they were children not adults, she spoke down to them like teacher to pupil when she is just such a young girl herself in the role she played. I really think someone else should have played her part. But besides that this series was beautiful, it charmed and enthralled me, wishing I could enter into its world forever away from all the harshness and ugliness of today. I loved the sleepy village scenes and countryside. Its so wonderful and refreshing to feel better and uplifted in myself and my day after each episode compared to the many depressing movies and other series that leave you down and sad for days. Its like sitting down in your favourite armchair, wearing your most comfortable slippers by an open fire, and drinking a very welcome cup of tea. Absolutely delightful!! PLEASE BBC. Give us more. And more.. :o)",2014
6,Period pieces are really hard.,2013
4,"This is a slow moving series which I take for a comedy in the style of Ballykissangel but a period piece. And to be fair I'm not in a position to judge. I am about eight episodes into this series but have never seen more than ten minutes of an episode. I was able to recognize Dawn French from The Vicar of Dibley and Brendan Coyle from Downton Abbey but the remainder of the cast is unknown to me. Basically I find the show a cure for insomnia. Really, the nights I can't sleep and even an Ambien won't help, this show makes me comatose; hence the not seeing more than ten minutes of any episode. It does seem to have excellent production values and I am somewhat disappointed at my reaction but if you need an anodyne to induce Morpheus to visit then this is it.",2013
6,"I too am a Stargate buff & like Amanda Tapping. It is my opinion that the show is worth the watch. On watching the first episode I liked what I saw, then after a few I didn't so much. However, my son had continued to watch it & told me not to give up on it just yet. So I went back to it & got pleasantly surprised. Some episodes were as good as full length movies. I particularly liked Jonathon young's character, Nikola Tesla:) Amanda played an extremely believable lady from England & I thought her accent was just great. It was a complete transformation from Samantha Carter of SG1. This character was a more domineering in control person who knew what she wanted and how to get it. The settings & special effects were pretty darn good I thought. It seemed a fair amount of thought and time went into these areas. Like all TV shows there is going to be an episode or three that doesn't appeal or seems to loose focus to the individual. However, overall I felt good about watching the show.",2012
8,Interesting way to release this new series - webisodes every couple of weeks that are about 15 minutes long. Put them all together and you potentially have a pilot of just over two hours.,2007
7,"Just to get this out of the way, ""Sanctuary"" is one of the best-looking shows on television; the strange, unique blend of science fiction, horror, and fantasy really add to the overall strangeness and beauty of the lush CGI, comic book-style visuals. In fact, ""Sanctuary"" does seem like a weird, live-action hybrid combining elements of horror and sci-fi comics, plus, as a few other viewers mentioned, ""The X-Files"" and ""Buffy, the Vampire Slayer"" and maybe even the ""Underworld"" films.",2008
7,"I found the first few episodes a bit silly, and watched them only for good ol' Amanda Tapping, because I wanted to see how she's doing after the deep hole of Stargate cancellation, after I saw her a few seconds in Stargate Universe.",2009
4,I've just finished watching the 2 episode pilot for the TV series of Sanctuary. I really wanted to like Sanctuary. a good premise and a reliable actress well able to carry off the lead role. Even the supporting cast are good.. and the atmosphere was great. Yes I Had high hopes. As a fan of sci-fi and fantasy over many years I am familiar with the suspension of disbelief required to immerse one's self into a created universe. Unfortunately the writing left me wondering exactly how much disbelief I was expected to suspend. The show is marketed for all ages but is so simple in its execution that its prime audience must be young adults. ,2008
6,"This show hearkens back to a few of the shows from the 90s like ""Poltergeist: The Legacy"" and even the first six seasons of ""The X-Files"".",2008
8,"Sanctuary is a fun show to watch. Amanda Tapping and crew do a fine job of telling interesting stories. Many of the story lines came straight from the webisodes. However, the topics were highly compelling, the acting wonderful; especially with all the green screens, and the production may be the wave of the future for most TV series.",2009
10,Funny what happens when a good group of people get together with a great idea... ,2008
6,"Sanctuary had a good premise to make it different. Unfortunately, step by step, ideas including Jack the Ripper, Merlin, immortality etc. got in and mess the show. Why choose old, reused for a hundred time stories, despite the show target - subspecies of humans ? In the same time the house look more like a prison to me, a combination of 1870 HIGH TECH"" with nowadays technology. The good doctor and his daughter use bullets and guns as main weapons against enemies who attack one by one (?), except some scenes design to show their prowess in hand to hand combat. The scenery is a obviously hint to doctor Frankestein novel, but they put a lot of work in making the environment believable. Still, there is no info about the subspecies living conditions, cause of mutations, personalities, etc. The man with two heads, the lizard or the mermaid are just background to the main cast. Make them count !",2008
10,"OK... so in reality I've only watched the first 4 episodes but... I really like getting to see Amanda Tapping as another character. It's great to see... don't get me wrong, I love Samantha Carter but still. Also, I think it's neat to see Amanda bringing together her enjoyment of science and her love of acting. All that being said, I really like the premise of the show over all. Its intriguing and entertaining. I'm looking forward to seeing what other 'abnormals' are created for this series. From what I've seen so far this looks to be a very creative and imaginative show. I can't wait to see more!",2008
9,"When this program was first released, I was put off in the previews by Amanda Tapping with a British accent, so I skipped watching it. She may have been born in the UK, but her American accent seems to pop out at times. However, I decided that after three seasons on the air, I would watch the program. I was not disappointed. The story is a very interesting look at the Sanctuary that Dr. Helen Magnus operates to protect ""Abnormal"" beings.",2011
2,"I am so disappointed in the direction this show has gone in with its second season. The first season of Sanctuary had so much promise. I loved the atmosphere of mystery and the mixture of supernatural and science fiction elements, and the virtual sets they used allowed them to create a world that closed in around those elements. The acting was excellent, and the characters well rounded. But alas, it seems that the producers have abandoned all of that for an amped up, action show with shoot-em-ups and monster attacks. They have abandoned much of the virtual sets concept and have gone to real-world settings, which totally ruins the atmosphere of the show. They have turned the Sanctuary itself from a secretive organization to a para-military organization that has its own Navy! COME ON! Gone is the mystery, and here comes the explosions! It really is sad because this series was so different and fresh in the beginning, as was Amanda Tapping's portrayal of Helen Magnus. But for her character as well, she has changed and not for the better. They have basically turned her into science genius with a gun, another Sam Carter but with dark hair and a Victorian accent. And I really do think she has a better acting range than that, because she showed it in the first season. And the new characters they have brought in (with the exception of Tesla) are irritating. I watched it through the season finale for Season 2, but I think I am going to drop the show from my viewing list. I have to say it again...too bad. This show had such promise. Now, I think it will end up more of a staple of Sci-Fi Saturday movies (bad monster flicks) because that is where the material is heading.",2010
8,Full disclosure: I pretty much love everything about Amanda Tapping. So it's not a big surprise that I love this series so much.,2014
10,"Absolutely love the show! Two thumbs up! Sanctuary and Warehouse 13 have now taken the place of Stargate SG1 and Atlantis for me, although Stargate Universe has been getting way better in Season 2. Obviously the heart of what made Stargate SG1 so popular moved through Atlantis and continued on to Sanctuary! Thanks Damian, Amanda,and Marty!!! I like Dunne & Robbins. Heyerdahl is exceptional! Agam Darshi - nice addition ..... More Druit, Wingfield and Young please - These guys rock! Goa'uld beget Wraithe beget Abnormals - OK,VERY COOL! Keep the DeLouise boys in the loop and maybe throw in some RickyD, a little Chris Judge and of course Michael Shanks as periodic guests and you have the IT factor that made Stargate in the first place - the main cast, producers, and writers! Would be nice to see Simon and Williams back in the gang as well! I do believe that Apophis and Baal would make superb Abnormals! Keep up the good work guys - This is great! KUDOS! Amanda,and Marty!!!",2010
1,Wow.,2008
2,monsters? super powers? it's cheap comedy rather then dark-side SF. As a fan of the genre i saw many productions read a lot of SF book - so when I see the 'science-fiction' as the genre - I have some expectations.,2008
7,"I cannot seem to figure out what this show is missing. It has a great cast, Amanda Tapping at her best. The premise of the show....excellent, offer sanctuary to those that might be ""different"" than the ""normal"" humans. the storyline is great....",2008
6,"This show is worth watching. However, it seems to struggle to locate itself and this is always due to the strength of script. The show badly needs good writers who can bring depth to it and lift it out of the B-film category. The best shows we've ever seen are memorable because they tell us something about life and about ourselves. At this juncture this show is like munching on popcorn...not really good enough to endure. Canadian production can do better. The best thing they've done thus far is introduce Agam Darshi to the cast. She picks up the show's energy by a good number of points. Still, we need to see better scripts. As for Nikola Tesla being a vampire...this is bizarre and not terribly bright. It makes as much sense as introducing Ghandi as a zombie. Tesla remains one of the great unsung heroes of modern technology. Please do some thinking before you commit a script to production.",2010

8,"The Duchess - Set at the end of the eighteenth century, The Duchess is based on the life of Georgiana Cavendish (Kiera Knightley), Duchess of Devonshire. The film delves into Georgiana's passionate and doomed affair with Earl Grey, the future Prime Minister, and the complex love triangle with her husband (Ralph Fiennes) and Georgiana's best friend, Lady Bess Foster (Hayley Atwell).",2009
9,"After reading copious amounts of mediocre reviews for ""The duchess"", I wasn't expecting much from this film. However, from the first scene I was utterly absorbed.",2008
8,"The career of Keira Knightley has been somewhat of a mixed bag. She has had strong moments, invariably under the direction of Joe Wright, and she has had her less brilliant moments, mainly in the later ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films. But, in ""The Duchess"", an entertaining and moving portrait of Georgiana, the Duchess of Devonshire, she truly shows signs that she is coming of age with a performance of subtlety and nuance.",2008
8,"What rather wonderful about this story is that Georgiana Spencer (Keira Knightley) discovers a way to exult in victory over things and to get back some kind of power in a time where, really, women had very little Being someone of great vitality and liveliness, she was very much a dreamer and an idealist, a woman who loved being the center of attention, who loved the fact at some point that her picture was in the paper, that the clothes were always talked of, that her every move was commented on ",2009
9,"I came away from the cinema after seeing The Duchess feeling I had had my consciousness of what life must have been like for the aristocracy of 18th century England dramatically raised (both literally and metaphorically). The story of Georgiana's marriage unfolds by subtle degrees amidst the most sumptuous of interiors and landscaped gardens - all beautifully filmed and realistically recreated. Apart from the main characters, there appear a rich selection of characters from neighbouring strata of society - aristocrats, political activists, servants and children (as babies and older) both legitimate and illegitimate - all of whom contribute to weaving the screenplay into an immensely fascinating narrative. I was already a fan of both Keira Knightly and Ralph Fiennes before seeing The Duchess, so I was pleased to find that their performances were well up to - and in the case of Ms Knightly even surpassing - my expectations. Even those who aren't normally 'into' period dramas (like me) should, I feel sure, find much to appreciate in this excellent film.",2008
7,"The latest slice of period drama to grace our screens is this biopic on Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, who during the 1770s was patroness of the Whig party and prisoner of a marriage which made her, among other things, suffer the indignity of having her husband's mistress living under the same roof. These heritage dramas are an industry all by themselves; the armies of prop hirers, wig and costume makers, researchers, production designers, location scouts and (mostly) British actors who go to make them must find themselves in almost permanent employ. The BBC does them, the Americans have a go at them, and the public can't seem to get enough of them. The Duchess is a superior example of the genre, though nowhere in the league of Kubrick's Barry Lyndon, and combines the spectacle of Keira Knightley looking glamorous in a range of frocks and wigs, while at the same time honing her acting talents (no more those rictus grins), with the guilty pleasure of following the uncomfortable parallels between the fortunes and indiscretions of the ancestress of Lady Diana Spencer with those of the Princess of Wales herself. Lowering over the whole proceedings is the truly superb presence of Ralph Fiennes's Duke of Devonshire, Fiennes an actor who can convey polite discomfiture or threatening ire with slightest twitch of the mouth. In his hands the Duke becomes far less a melodramatic villain than a product of his time, and you almost feel sorry for him. Go and see The Duchess; only those who have had children will balk at the liberties taken with childbirth and breastfeeding. But not even that will spoil the fun.",2008
8,"I couldn't wait for The Duchess, I am just a huge fan of period pieces and Kiera Knightly is becoming a fantastic actress in this genre. I was looking forward to this film mainly because I studied Georgina a little bit in college for my history class and I always thought she was such an elegant and strong woman that stood out from the others. She was like the Madonna of her day, she had a great sense of style, self, and strength. While the movie is not completely accurate, it still was a fine movie to watch. Kiera truly held her own as Georgina and was absolutely stunning. One of the underlining stories that I appreciate in this film is the battle of the sexes. Ralph Fiennes who plays the Duke of Devonshire does a fantastic job as well and he plays this anti-villain, shows the true side of the pain and pressure men felt but how they looked at women as nothing but property. This story truly touches you and makes you grateful for our present day.",2008
10,"This film really, really surprised me.",2008
6,"Keira Knightley's period drama for the year 2008 is a well-crafted one, but lacking in anything new and exciting. The Dutchess is your run-of-the-mill tale of unrequited love amidst the artifice of a marriage of utility. It all begins with a gathering of teenagers, playing their games in the yard while the adults talk inside, planning the futures for their children behind closed doors. When Georgiana's mother tells her how she will be the next Duchess of Devonshire, you are almost shocked at her reaction. So happy and excited that a man could love her after only two meetings, she cannot wait to leave and start her new life  seemingly forgetting all about that boy in the yard for whom she obviously has feelings for. This is a time of regimented rules, of lives orchestrated for success and not allowed to spontaneously evolve. A decision that I don't think she could have said no to anyways just set up her entire life's journey, one full of happiness, wealth, and eventual heartbreak.",2008
4,"The costumes are wonderful, the country houses are spectacular, but the story is rather a one note affair. This is indeed a shame, as the book on which the film is based, is a rich and interesting biography.",2008
10,"Okay, so let's put this in context, if you don't like period dramas, don't go and see this movie, you probably won't like it, and it is NOT Diana's story, nothing like although some in the marketing department thought so ...",2008
5,"I'm of two minds about this film. On the one hand, Saul Dibb has managed to turn a book into an entertaining film about the trials and tribulation - and, let's keep things in perspective, extremely privileged life - of the frolicking Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire (Keira Knightley). It hits all the targets of the romantic genre, and does so with a nice mix of emotional scenes, witty banter, and even some interesting discussions.",2014
3,"Having read the book that this film is based upon my expectations were high although I thought that the short running time could not possibly do justice to the 450 pages of the book, and I was not wrong. It barely skimmed the massive detail contained in the book and was a big let down for me. It was beautifully made with seemingly no expense spared on costumes or locations but to give one example no mention was made of the huge gambling debts run up by the Duchess, which was of course a major problem for her. The author of the book must have been severely disappointed as after seeing this poor film few would want to read her excellent book assuming it to be as bad as the film.",2012
6,"The locations, specially Bath are the most cinematic aspect of this opportunistic tale. The Duchess, it seems, was a distant relative of Lady Diana Spencer's and there is a certain symmetry in their stories but Keira Knightly projects only an ""actressy"" air. She was superb in ""Pride and Prejudice"" but here she just simply poses and stares. Ralph Finnes's awful Duke is much more believable. The extra marital doomed love story between the Duchess and Dominic Cooper left me completely cold and perhaps that's were the problem resides. Their relationship, their ""love"" should have consumed us for the sketchy tale to work, but it didn't. Still, the locations, I repeat, are breathtaking and ""The Duchess"" can be seen if you don't expect to be other than an spectator.",2008
3,"Another attempt to put real British history and characters on the screen for US audiences, only it does not contain much history - it was a really exciting period politically with loads of REAL characters far more interesting than the Duchess of Devonshire - and is just a tired retelling of parallels with the Charles/Diana/Camilla menage-a-trois done out with a glossy video of the best of UK country houses. Keira Knightley, over-exposed, cannot live up to the demands of being centre stage but does her best. Portrayal of aristocrats in 18th century is laughable, and, as for 'all girls together in a man's world, while I shag your husband'- what a total joke!Let Diana rest in peace!",2008
6,"When Quentin Tarantino presented Reservoir Dogs at Sundance in 1992, he famously stated that Merchant-Ivory productions were a major turn-off for him, much like on-screen violence could be for someone else. No one else seems to agree with him, though, or at least not openly, since lots of British directors are trying to become the next James Ivory (the real one lost his mojo with The White Countess, which also marked his last collaboration with the late producer Ismail Merchant). And while Joe Wright hit the jackpot with Pride & Prejudice and Atonement, his colleague Saul Dibb doesn't fare as well with The Duchess, an elegant but frigid costume drama which fails to be particularly dramatic.",2008
8,"""The Duchess"" tells the tale of the beautiful young Georgiana Spencer (Knightley) who, in the late 18th century, is married to the much older Duke of Devonshire (Fiennes) and attains wealth, status, and prestige, all at the price of being condemned to a loveless marriage. It's familiar ground: the duke is the typically phlegmatic English nobleman, unable to express or perhaps even experience emotions, while his wife is in every way his superior: in intellect, courage, self-reliance, devotion to children, etc.",2008
3,"The period drama never has been a genre that has offered cinema attendees high octane thrills and pacing, instead opting for a much more subdued, elegant formula to tell whatever historically placed story it may be willing to explore. To say that much of the genre as a result is usually unfairly deemed as dry to the point of uselessness would be somewhat of an understatement; in fact the vast majority of such films, although slow and exceedingly dry, usually make up for their blandness in story with well rounded, memorable and exciting characters. The Duchess however, is not one of these films. No, this is dry turkey with an ostensible glaze created by superficial juice. Going through the motions at every turn, director Saul Dibb fails to create anything worth noting here; it's an extremely straight-forward, standardised period drama with little to no interesting characters whatsoever. So not only do you have to sit through a soap opera plot that feels about as fresh and exciting as seeing Keira Knightley in another period costume, but you have to do so with inane personas that never do anything but pamper about in their big mansions, shouting at their servants. Dull, dreary and utterly disposable, The Duchess is as boring as the genre gets, and while there are some good elements present, they fail to mesh coherently to disguise the fact that the script has no intrinsic value inherent in its thin, formulaic design.",2008
5,"Call me obtuse, but I will never understand the fascination so many people experience when confronted with the lifestyle and behavior of the so-called nobility, one of the worst species of parasite on our blighted planet. This movie concerns, by and large, the antics of a 'duke', equipped with more money than sense, whose main interests in life seem to be young women (preferably naked in bed) and dogs. Predictably, his young, naive and perhaps not terribly bright wife is the victim of the duke's callous, capricious behavior, and, in spite of some attempts to assert her trodden-upon dignity, she is finally discomfited in the end: a bit like Winston Smith in the last chapter of Orwell's '1984'. The playwright and the director have missed a unique opportunity to highlight the obscene contrast between the majority of the British population and their idle, parasitical and cruel 'aristocracy'. Worse still, peasants and the urban working class are occasionally shown while wildly cheering 'progressive' candidates to a general election when these pussyfoot around, promising some vaguely-worded 'reforms'. How the undeserving class known as aristocracy could be (and alas, still can be) respected and generally admired, will always remain a complete mystery to me.",2008
4,"I saw The Duchess on Saturday night, the latest English period piece (this time late 18th century) starring Kiera Knightly as a woman in a bad relationship. This time she is Georgiana, a slender, attractive, fashionable, emotional woman who is all but sold to the Duke of Devonshire, played as an ice-cold, aging, brute by Ralph (he would like you to call him ""Rafe"") Fiennes. The Duke of Love he is not, at one point he defends his disinterest, his rampant infidelity and his abuse of the power of his birthright by saying: ""I love you in the way I understand love."" As he understands it, the intent of marriage is nearly exclusive to produce a male heir which Georgiana fails to do on numerous tries. While he is waiting, he produces an illegitimate daughter and invites another woman to comes to live in the palace and attend social functions with the two of them. Georgiana takes solace in the future prime minister Charles Grey. They produce Eliza, whom she must give up or lose the children she has with the Duke. Georgiana eventually lives out her life quietly and is officially replaced as wife after her death. The movie is interesting largely because the relationship bears such a striking resemblance to the Prince Charles / Lady Diana Spencer (who is a descendant of one of the characters) / Camilla Parker Bowles affair. Diana/Georgiana are fashion icons both beloved by the nation (""the only one not in love with Georgiana is the Duke"" as one character describes the common wisdom). Charles / Duke are both dull (in most ways that word can be defined), plodding remnants of a once powerful royalty who would have risen to not a quantum of the power they possessed if left to their own devices. Of course, modern divorce laws and the continued marginalization of the monarchy meant that Diana would not share Georgiana's fate. The movie, and to some extent the modern story, put the lie to Disney's princess stories my girl's favor and suggest that Prince William may not be dreamy as you might think.",2011
9,"It seems that with each passing year, there comes a point in time when we will inevitably find the young and beautiful, Keira Knightly, in yet another period drama. It also seems like every period drama these days, whether it features Knightly or not, feels the need to disassociate itself from the conventions of the past and assert itself as fresh, with a unique twist on the genre. This is particularly challenging when the story is one we've seen a number of times prior. The true story of Georgina Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire, as told by director, Saul Dibb, in THE DUCHESS, is one where a young girl of ""modest"" heritage is married off to an esteemed Duke for a price. Her duty is to serve his grace and provide to him a male heir. As a woman, she is nothing more than a decorative commodity and should she not be able to fulfill her wifely promises, then she is essentially useless. Dibb is smart about it though. With the point already made before the film even begins, he chooses to focus instead on the reality of this kind of imprisonment  what it feels like for a girl beneath her binding bodice.",2008
7,"The marriage between Lady Georgiana Spencer and William Cavendish, Duke of Devonshire, was an arranged union between two of eighteenth-century England's most powerful aristocratic families. It appears to have been loveless from the start; the Duke was more interested in hunting and his dogs than in his wife, whom he only married so that she might provide him with a son and heir. He took his wife's best friend, Lady Elizabeth Foster, as his mistress; the three lived under the same roof in a ménage a trois. Georgiana threw herself into her own interests- gambling and political campaigning- and eventually took a lover of her own, the handsome young politician (and future Prime Minister) Charles Grey, by whom she had an illegitimate daughter.",2008

All of us laughed a lot and left the theater talking about how we thought it was a very funny movie. Consistently the remarks were that we didn't expect it to be so good! The laughs in the theater were very loud and seemed to be coming from throughout the auditorium. Perhaps this humor isn't for everyone but it never occurred to me until now that there would be so many lower ratings. I say this because I most always feel the reviews here at IMDb are right on and rely upon them for my movie going choices. My wife feels the same way about this...very confused at the lower score.

So why does he feel compelled to write and produce films of such appallingly low quality? It worked with his initial efforts, Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore. Those two films defied any sense of logical criticism. They were sloppy, yet contained a maniacal sense of anarchic glee. He seemed thrilled at what he was getting away with. Yet, since the release of those films over a decade ago, he has continued to crank out by-the-numbers mediocrity that lacks any feeling of comic discovery.",2008

Absolutely on the level on movies such as Happy Gilmore, maybe better in its own way. Now don't get me wrong, all of the humor is juvenile and the movie is certainly not going to win any Oscars, but expect people to be quoting it left and right, cause nearly every line is hilarious.

No one really wants to watch (or listen to for that matter)Zohan do a 75 year old lady. Some of the scenes were put in order that didn't make sense and many of the scenes were not even needed.

It felt preachy about tried to teach tolerance when it came to people from the middle east but came off unbelievably stupid.

3,"What has happened to Adam Sandler? Billy Madison is one of my all-time favorite comedies, the romance-inclined Wedding Singer is fantastic, and his forays into serious farePunch-Drunk Love and Reign Over Mehave shown the talent hidden beneath the 5-year old trapped in a 40-year old body routine. As far as his production company's new work goes, in my opinion, a lot is left to be desired. Sadly, You Don't Mess with the Zohan does nothing to alleviate those feelings. Yes the trailer looked absolutely horrible, but I still held hope that something would click and give me an enjoyable experience once again. Don't get me wrong, I definitely laughed throughout, it's just that those laughs were more out of embarrassment for those on screen and because if I didn't chuckle at the asinine events, I would have needed to walk out from boredom. It appears that the Judd Apatow name means zilch when attached to a film he does not deem important enough to direct himself.

To inspire one, to be confident and persistent. At least, I was affected in this way. I presume, that this movie is suitable for those, who have a very deep and grim times, who need some sort of wake up call to evoke positive feelings to what's life.. to make one be optimistic again...",2010

5,"In one respect I can see how pounding your fists and feet into another human being until they pass out could be considered the only true sport. It would suit me since I am six feet tall and 220+ so that would make me favored against a large percentage of the other earthling scum. This film is truly Neanderthal in its value system. In ancient societies it was important to cultivate a thug beat-down mentality in a large contingent of the population so the wimp elite could send them off to die in wars of conquest. Problem is, these days war is conducted by computer geeks, not street thugs. So this movie comes off as outmoded and quaint. Kinda like Aristotle recommending homosexuality to keep the ancient Greek armies marching with a smile. No, these days the elite use movies like 300 to incite hatred, make genocide look like fun, and glorify dying, all so a bunch of politicians, priests, and wealthy landowners can profit from our blood. That takes care of the mental training whereas the kids can use video games to achieve the motor coordination skills needed to be the most effective mass murderers in history. So I guess this movie is fine to fire up the infantry cannon fodder. I would like to think our society operates at a slightly higher level. The invention of edged flint tools 50,000 years ago makes the premise of this movie a tad obsolete. When I was in high school the after-school fights were a social event, but the bully pecking order was established with bats, knives and guns. I guess as a sissy white-trash substitute for real violence, this fight club BS must be what passes for street tough these days.",2010
8,"Perhaps my descriptive summary is unkind to this film. I enjoyed it so much because it depicts a young man learning to deal with his emotions, rather than being ruled by his fear of them. It is quite remarkable, the strength of character he ultimately develops, and his interactions with his instructor are gratifyingly free of the childish morality one dreads in such a film, or the typical oriental platitudes that often hallmark them because of the origins of martial arts. At the root of this, I think, is the film's willingness to observe and comment on the 'problem' emotion of anger. Rather than leave it festering, or simply transform it 'as if by magic', the audience can almost see the transformation in the main character, through his physical exertion, which eventually leaves him free of its destructive role in his life. For most, if not all, these reasons, I enjoyed the film because it resonated with me quite closely, but it may not be everyone's cup of tea.",2008
9,"This movie is quite predictable. The story of a boy that gets into trouble in school and starts fighting because of that isn't original, but between all the predictable movies with this theme, certainly this is the best.",2009
6,"It's interesting how this movie seems to be a watershed for mma. Mixed martial arts really are making the transition from underground, extreme bleeding-edge expressions of combat sport to a mainstream and accepted pastime, and that shows in the commentary about this film. Those who have a clue about mma aren't saying the same things as those who don't.",2008
1,"This is the Casablanca of teen Mixed Martial Arts films for the year 2008. I went in with the lowest expectations, and was disappointed even more so, which makes for better movie. The writers should have done what Jake Tyler didn't do in one of cheesy fight sequences...that is TAPOUT! Plus, they picked the coolest name in cinema history, JAKE TYLER! You can't get any cooler than that. If my parents named me Jake Tyler, I would have gotten more muff than a 70's porn star. The fact that people actually went to see this film and took it seriously perplexes me. This is why the industry keeps making films such as ""Never Back Down"" because every ""TAPOUT"" apparel wearing barbarian thinks that plots, acting, and originality are things of the past. Two words to describe this film...""LAUGH RIOT!"" I was merely going for the sake of humor and heckling, but I believe I gave the American movie going public more credit by thinking they would watch something a little more credible and leave the theater empty for others such as myself going for the exact same reasons. Once again...I was mistaken. Fearing the repercussions of heckling and laughing out loud every time they mentioned the title of the movie in their dialogue would leave me pulverized by the 3 TAPOUT wearing tools in front of me, I kept my laughter at a reasonable volume. Calling this movie a modern day ""Rocky"" or ""Karate Kid"" is an insult to those writers who took the time to create something original for the public in the 80's. Pat Morita must be rolling in his grave....of laughter. HAHAHAHAH!",2008
8,"I saw the movie at a screening in LA a few weeks back, and really liked it. I haven't really gotten into the whole UFC/mixed martial arts thing, but I thought the fighting in this movie was exciting. Very fast, very intense, and as movies go enjoyable. The editing and the stunts worked well. The story is cliché, but so what, as it never gets old. A coming of age fight movie has to have something going on between the fights, and Djimon Hounsou did an amazing job. The movie is definitely worth a look and Djimon is always clutch. The movie works for what it is a fun, action-packed and full of hot girls flick! I'd see it again.",2008
6,"Wow, there is not one ugly person in all of Orlando, at least that's what this film wants you to believe. Do any high schools or high school students look like this, come on. What I love best is the quote on the back of the box "" A little Karate Kid, a little Fight Club and a whole lot of The OC"", WHAT? Is that suppose to make me buy it, please find me someone who loves all three of those, ya, no one. OK, so the film is not all bad, Djimon Hounsou is good as always, the look of the film is unique and the fight scenes are pretty darn good. Unfortunately the plot is predictable the characters are one dimensional, there is a girl cause there has to be, right and it attempts to send a message and fails horribly. I think the directors theory is fill the film with fight scenes and loud music montages and then you don't have to have character development or to much of their crappy dialogue. So I guess that helps the film instead of hurting it.",2008

9,"Now in the 21st century, the old school brawlin' movies are over with. Their fad has worn out. Now, we are shoveled crap like Meet The Spartans and other seriously stupid parody movies, and then movies where senseless violence reigns dominant and there is no point to the movie anymore. But the beat-em-up genre has returned with Never Back Down.",2008
1,"Picture the classic movie formula: Guy gets into a fight. Guy loses the fight and the girl. Guy goes to some karate master. Guy wins the fight.

1,"Let's just start with my personal debate: Was the the most cliché' or second most cliché movie ever. And I really can't think of one that takes the cake from it. I started thinking that this might have been the worst 8 bucks I have ever spent near the beginning with the tedious overplayed high school drama, but didn't start all out laughing at how bad this movie was until the supporting male friend figure shot off the line ""But you can do what I could never do"" ""What's that?"" the protagonist replies. To which the former replies ""Achieve greatness."" And I am totally serious. That's really in that movie. ",2008
8,"I wasn't sure what exactly to expect from this movie, but it ended up being very satisfying and entertaining. There is a lot more to it than you see in the trailer.",2008
6,"I saw the film at a screening last night, expecting a hot, angsty white kid, teen romp with lots of inappropriate violence highlighted by super slow motion spit and blood after every shot to the face. I thought I would only be able to laugh at how seriously the movie takes itself. ",2008
1,"Another over hyped movie which leads to nothing more than just watching a bunch retarted teens making-out or beating each other skulls in. I like how the movie likes to show off every bit of ""half-naked"" guys and girls while at school, Christ, what world are they living in? The best way to describe this movie would be American Pie meets Karate kid. This film is just another over hyped movie which will make millions and millions of dollars from a script which was probably written by a bunch of monkeys with a type-writer.",2008
1,If this movie doesn't find its way into the bottom 100 I would be shocked. It was unbelievably bad. I can't believe this got the green light and Arrested Development got canceled. ,2008
3,"Yeah, that's how I felt after watching this movie. Granted, this features fighting instead of dancing, at least (yes, I'm ashamed to admit...) the choreography in ""You Got Served"" was pretty kick ass and made up for the watered down story. On the one hand, this movie is ""Karate Kid"" meets ""any number of dance movies we've seen in the last couple of years that all have basically the same story"" but on the other hand this doesn't have the excitement of anything else we've seen in the previous films. Don't get me wrong, I LOVED ""Fight Club"" but at least that movie had cajones. Basically this a rental at best. Three out of ten.",2008
10,I saw this movie at a free screening a little while ago (when it was called 'Get Some') and thoroughly enjoyed it. The fighting scenes are absolutely amazing. They did a good job of making sure the stunts didn't look fake - it's all very realistic. The way they shot it literally makes you feel like you're in those fights. I was blown away - and exhausted! - by the end of the movie.,2008

For the most part, the reaction was positive, and the jokes that failed miserably will probably get edited out by the time the movie officially opens.",2008

7,"Semi-Pro takes place in the 1970s and is all about a small time basketball team named the Flint Michigan Tropics. The head coach, owner, and promoter is Jackie Moon (Will Ferrell) and he and his team dream of expanding to be part of the big time NBA. However Jackie is told that in order to actually have a chance at getting into the NBA, the Tropics have to get at least 2000 fans in their stadium by deadlines. The problem is that the Tropics do a little more dancing, fighting, and flailing around the court than actually playing the game. So Jackie hires a new team player named Monix (Woody Harrelson) who actually used to play for the NBA. From there on in it's up to Jackie, Monix, and the whole team to fire up some wild and crazy events for the crowd and actually learn to play the sport properly for once in order to reach their dreams.",2008
3,This movie is a perfect example of why Will Ferrel needs to find his purpose quick before he becomes irrelevant.,2008
7,"I never for a moment believed that this movie would be earth-shattering or mind-blowing. I expected it to be along the lines of ""Talladega Nights"" or ""Kicking & Screaming,"" and it was. There were a few laugh out loud moments, and a few mildly amusing stretches, and then there were parts that just weren't funny at all.",2008

2,"I work in a movie theater part time and we got Semi-Pro, now I hate Will Ferrell with a passion, I don't get how people love his movies, some of them are funny, but it's more of his side characters that get the laughs from me. But I figured, I needed a laugh after work and I decided to just go ahead and see the movie, it might have a few good laughs, I saw it for fee and even that was too much for what this film was. I'm very much not kidding, this movie, the theater was about 75% full and there was only two people who laughed, even that was just a chuckle. I don't get what is so funny about making Will Ferrell puke, in fact let's play on that joke quite a bit so it becomes more awkward. Let's also put in jokes that refer to ""the future"" since it's set in the 70's, that'll be a blast. And also, let's put in some extremely uncomfortable shots of Will Ferrell's crotch, yeah, that was so funny, that I wanted to puke.",2008
10,"So far I am the fourth person to rate this movie; and I honestly don't agree with anybody else here. I really only rate movies I truly enjoyed, and this is one of them. I don't think anybody that has seen Will's movies and disliked them should be commenting on here.",2008
7,"In the opening of Director Kent Alterman's ""Semi-Pro"" Will Ferrell as 70's One Hit Wonder Jackie Moon provides his musical stylings of his song ""Do Me Sexy"". Will Ferrell sings his disco song straight up in character and is hysterical. Although given the promising start Alterman and Writer Scot Armstrong's movie really falls flat, despite some big laughs. I particularly cracked up at the halftime bit where Jackie dressed as 'Mr. Sun' and the rest of his Tropics teammates are dressed as sea creatures. Some of the supporting performances are pretty good including Woody Harrelson playing a quasi-realistic Monix and Andre Benjamin as Tropics leading scorer Clarence Black. Will Ferrell is at his best playing obtuse, lovable, and arrogant Jackie. However, the problem with ""Semi-Pro"" over the long haul (all 90 minutes) is that it is not smart stupidit is stupid stupid. I was really a fan of ""Blades of Glory"" and ""Talladega Nights"". ""Semi-Pro"" is not nearly as funny as either. Understandably, if you are not a fan of Big Will, then disregard the previous, and pretty much most of this comment. The ending of ""Semi-Pro"" is incongruously bittersweet. This seems so out of place. Then again, arguing for context in ""Semi-Pro"" is futile.",2008
7,"I always find that Will Ferrell's films can be a little hit and miss. He's either funny, or he tries a little too hard to be funny. Luckily, in the case of 'Semi-Pro,' he's the former. The film is clearly his vehicle, so whether it works or not is largely down to him. Here he plays Jackie Moon – the owner, coach and player of a low league basketball team who are about to get disbanded, unless they can scrape fourth place in the league.",2014
7,"As a student, I have always enjoyed Will Ferrell films. In fact I have walked out of some films still in stitches. I have really enjoyed Old School, Anchorman and Kicking and Screaming as well as his Saturday Night Live DVDs. He does tend to play either the arrogant tool (Ron Burgundy) or the angry idiot (Frank The Tank) and he has done this well. I also enjoyed his other cameo roles in Zoolander and Wedding Crashers. However, it seems that he is getting more disappointing nowadays, which is a shame (Talladega Nights a prime example).",2008
3,"I actually had some hope for this movie, i thought they could have done some good work with this plot. But no, this one was worse than Talledegah Nights! Will Farrel just taking professions and trying to make funny movies out of them is getting really old now. I got very few laughs out of this movie and when I did laugh it was only a little chuckle, because I was soon reminded that this movie sucked when another failed joke attempt came around. His attempt at witty and sometimes slapstick humor just doesn't work for me anymore. Its all just gotten old, its the same thing over and over again! This movie was worthless and I ask you to please stay home and save your money!",2008
3,"I would like to first say that the only reason I give this film 3 stars is because I am usually a major Will Ferrell fan. I normally find him hilarious and would be quoting lines from his films for months along with my husband. Well with his last movie ""Blades of Glory"" I received no lines to quote. It was awful. So when we were invited by friends last night to see Will Ferrell's latest ""Semi-Pro"", I thought I might be in for some big laughs. I was VERY disappointed. ",2008
3,"Take Kingpin, The Mighty Ducks, Dodgeball then add Will Ferrall & Basketball. Doesn't sound like much of a recipe for success? That's because it isn't. This is a movie all about celebrating failure. Not success, failure. This team don't win the league. They don't get promoted into the NBA.",2008
8,"Read the old ABA web page and find out how much of the movie is true. Semi pro has many influences from the ABA. The slam dunk style, bear wrestling, and cow milking contests were some of the funny material which made a great movie. Real life is funnier than fiction. Semi pro has great material too work with. A goofy movie with a no better goofy actor than Will Ferrell. Ferrell pulls off a hard acting job of a fly by the seat of his pants owner/coach/manager and player etc ABA operator. The acting and directing is great but the true star which shines is the script, which is influenced by real life. Low ball humor, not for the whole family. 8 out of 10. My buddy Dax and his wife enjoyed the movie. What does the Tropics have to do with Flint, Michigan? I think the team moved from Florida. Funny the Nuggets almost went to the final in their first year with the NBA. I guess that is why the NHL stripped the WHA Jets of their team before they merged. Just an after thought.",2008
6,"Will Ferrell's fourth and latest sports spoof comedy ""Semi-Pro"" (**1/2 stars out of ****) is semi-delusional. For the record, it's not in the same league with his NASCAR comedy ""Talladega Nights."" The former Saturday Night Live comedian stars here as one-shot disco music singer Jackie Moon who bought his hometown basketball team with the bucks that he earned from his Barry White-style, one hit wonder, chart-topping single ""Love Me Sexy."" Not only does Jackie own the Tropics of Flint, Michigan, but he also plays on, coaches, and promotes the team! ""Semi-Pro"" takes place in the nonconformist 1970s, and the fictional Tropics compete in the former real-life American Baseball Association (1967-1976) with its trademark red, white, & blue basketball and its 3-point shot. Clearly, this nostalgic, occasionally amusing basketball farce aspired to be for hoops movies what the legendary Paul Newman classic ""Slapshot"" was for ice hockey and the Tom Berenger farce ""Major League"" was for baseball. Mind you, the pranks, the pratfalls, and the humor are quintessential Will Ferrell when he is front and center, but Ferrell isn't always front and center, and the movie lacks the non-stop, over-the-top comic buffoonery of ""Talladega Nights."" ",2008
4,"Greetings again from the darkness. Will Ferrell is one of the funniest guys in show biz. A huge part of comedy is risk. No risk = No comedy. Big time producer, first time director Kent Alterman and ""Old School"" writer Scot Anderson team up with Ferrell and for some reason play it safe. Very safe. So safe that there are only a few chuckles here and not a single laugh out loud moment.",2008
2,"As a huge Will Ferrell fan, I was incredibly disappointed with this flick. Plain and simple: it sucked. The comedy failed to deliver the quotable lines, punchy comedy, or even slap-stick humor. It is very obvious they forced this rating up to 'R' with the addition of as many F bombs as possible, making the dialog choppy and reminiscent of junior high. I typically don't mind language if it's funny or appropriate, but this was neither. I give it one extra star because of maybe a couple chuckles.",2008

Those who 'get' the film will keep it alive forever, but Joe Moviegoer won't care if he ever sees it again. And so I turn to 'The Spirit,' a film which has similar qualities to 'Flash Gordon': bad enough to be awesome, tongue firmly in it's cheek and gentle satire in it's hand.",2008
7,"Hahhaa! Call me crazy but I actually quite enjoyed ""The Spirit"" and I think that a lot of other people would too if they understood what type of film this is. This film is an action comedy, much like the popular genre in the 80's and 90's except done in a more ""comic-book"" style.",2009
4,"I really wanted to like this but the main actor who played the Spirit was just plain awful. And everyone acting was dreadful, the writing is dreadful and the direction is dreadful. Maybe Frank Miller wanted that actors to Over act and over act they did BIG TIME. Sam L. Jackson is so over the top that it was painful. We were laughing at some scenes not because it was that funny, it was just that embarrassing. The first fight scene (not giving anything away), that the Octopuss had with the Spirit was force and confusing and so out of place and completely uninteresting.",2009

8,"Simply, this has the artistic appearance of Sin City, the same sense of time period only not rigidly so, and amusing dialog which in some cases is intentionally comedic and at times a little hokey like a comic book. It has an overall satisfying and polished feel. I'm not a comic-book fan but I enjoy a good comic book movie. I would definitely see it again. It's also not too long. All major players deliver. I won't say anything about how it ends...just that you don't go to the movie for the ending.

Granted, Frank Miller's style still makes for beautiful imagery, but Holy God, the man doesn't know the first thing about about the cinematic language! Some scenes go on like, what seems, forever! One scene in particular where the Spirit finds himself tied to a dentist chair while the Octopus and his sidekick Dental Floss, or whatever the name of Scarlet Johansson's character is, talk and talk and talk for... at least twenty minutes! I'm kidding you not! See for yourself when it opens.",2008
4,"I honestly thought he would treat this much-loved and admired classic with some respect. Guess I'm naive. It certainly looks gorgeous, but that's almost regrettable in a film that's otherwise so utterly, grindingly, gone-to-hell stupid. Awful performances (except by Gabriel Macht as Our Hero, who looks great with his wide earnest eyes and buff physique, and handles the lines about his love for the city with fine, tough conviction), jaw-droppingly overdone dialogue, what seems like hours of totally unnecessary comic material ...man, it's just dreadful, and a great disappointment to me. If I ever buy the DVD I'll only watch it with the sound turned off.",2008
5,"There is a lot to like about Frank Miller's debut as a solo director. The Spirit is shot with a similar style as his last film, Sin City, based upon his own graphic novels, and the imagery is quite stunning at times. I'm not familiar with Will Eisner's series for which the film is based, but after viewing scenes in stark black and white, with the bright red tie and blindingly white sneaker soles, coupled with the end credits artwork, I have to believe Miller did his best to bring those drawings to the big screen. The story too is intriguing, showing a superhero that works directly with the police; he is his own branch of the department, known by all and brought into cases like a detective. It's a refreshing take on the whole vigilante stigma that will be explained once his origins are relayed. However, while there is a lot to like, there is a lot more that will just make you shake your head in disappointment.",2008

Loved Sin City ( the movie and the comic books ), 300, etc etc. So what happened that was so bad that I registered with IMDb to write this review? To begin, the minimalistic green screen style was fun for Sin City, but it just became pointless and tired. The acting?? It was brutally obvious that these actors were acting alone in green screen land. No inspiration, no passion, nothing but emptiness. I am 39 years old, I have been a reader of comic books since I was 8. How the hell did these characters make it to the big screen? ""The Spirit"" is a stupid character. With stories like ""The Sandman"" and ""The Preacher"" yet to be made, this was a big waste! I just wanted to put a warning out there, this movie will make you want to stick a shiv in your own neck.",2009

But if your open you mind and your soul look to the aspects of life, in the context what is good and what is wrong, The evil and the hero...love and lost the love of your life, feelings and emotions. You can see some really funny details. Second time i watched it under influence of mushrooms i was overwhelmed with how this movie is created and how the artwork is done. You must be really creative and and have a open mind to make such a movie. So i can only say this, it is in my opinion not the worst movie ever, even in some ways it was perfect... I love it and for all that going to watch it, find your own spirit and then go watch this movie.",2009
3,"Sin City, it ain't. I saw this with people who said they liked it (they may or may not have been drinking), and that was accompanied by the disclaimer ""... so bad, it's good."" Just because it can be funny to watch something fail in it's own ineptness doesn't necessarily make it good.",2008
8,"I have to say this film won't win many moviegoers' hearts out there. Some people might think this film is cheesy, over the top, or just simply ridiculous. The thing is, this film jumps right out from comic book's pages. The scenes and the dialogues are just like watching moving comic book's drawings.",2008
10,"I saw Milk a while back, I was really looking forward to it because I had written a paper in my history class on Harvey Milk. We were learning about movements in the 60's and 70's, as a straight female, I saw one of my friends struggling with his sexuality and how hard it was for society, his friends, his own family excepting him for who he was. I wanted to find out more on the history of how we had either moved forward or backwards when it came to rights for homosexuals. Reading Harvey Milk's story was sad but extremely inspirational and looking at what people said about him, he seemed like the most lovable guy in the world. He was funny, charming, and just a wonderful person to be around, it was extremely sad to find out how his life ended and over something so stupid. Milk is one of the best films of 2008, it was made with great taste and Sean Penn delivers the performance of a lifetime playing the infamous Harvey Milk.",2009
9,"Gus Van Sant's talent and humility allows Harvey Milk to be a the center of this remarkable story without putting himself in front of the camera. Sean Penn shines with a new and extraordinary light as Harvey Milk. His humanity is overwhelming at times. That permanent smile defining his face talks volumes about his faith in people, no matter what. His awareness is filled with truth and innocence, he worries he's about to be 40 and hasn't accomplished anything. Little did he know.The film is constructed brilliantly in a series of vignettes that builds up into a whole fluid narrative. Josh Brolin, as the disturbed Dan White is another standout in a complex and remarkable performance. No cheap shots here. Diego Luna, Joseph Cross and Emile Hirsch are also terrific as the boys around Harvey but it is James Franco who truly gets under your skin. His romantic turn is one of the most compelling gay love stories I've ever seen (and I've seen Brokeback Mountain). Highly recommended!",2008
9,"It happened only 30 years ago but it looks and feels as if it had been much, much longer and yet we're still dealing with many of the same issues. Gus Van Sant moves slightly and respectfully to mainstream to tell us this inspiring and tragic story. Sean Penn is superb as Harvey Milk, none of the traits that made him famous are present here, other than his talent that is, he exudes a positive sweetness that is compelling and contagious. Josh Brolin as Dan White, manages the impossible by giving the assassin an unexpected but welcome humanity. James Franco as Milk's lover is, quite simply, scrumptious. As it happens with most biopics we're forced to run from event to event to be fair and accurate and ""Milk"" suffers from that. I wanted more insight into Diego Luna's character - the most problematic - and into Emile Hirsch's character but the essentials are here and the essentials must be listed in lyrical terms. History yes but also poetry. Hope as a theme. A triumph!",2008
9,"Enormously moving film/document about the raise and fall of Harvey Milk. If you don't know who he was, you will. The most startling feature of the film is the casting of Sean Penn. A stroke of genius. I, personally, never would have though that the range of this fantastic actor was as wide as this. He took me over and convinced me. I was watching Harvey Milk himself and Penn with the extraordinary support of his director never betrays that illusion. I'm sorry ""Milk"" didn't come out a few weeks ago. For those in California having to vote for Proposition 8, it would have been easier to decide just by watching Anita Bryant ranting about the evils of homosexuality. She sounded ridiculous then, Im sure, but today she sounds ridiculously ancestral. The vision of Harvey Milk is still, unfulfilled but we're certainly getting closer. Gus Van Sant surrounds our hero by an extraordinary group of young actors, in particular Emile Hirsch, James Franco and a superlative Josh Brolin. Not to be missed.",2008
9,Just caught the Portland premiere and have a few thoughts.,2008
10,"I had little expectations walking into this film. The trailer for this movie has appeared at almost every feature film I've seen for the last two months. But, the trailer is a facile example of this minutely detailed story of the rise of a leader and his martyrdom. While I'm familiar with the story from other sources (Shilts' ""The Mayor of Castro Street,"" and the 1984 documentary ""The Times of Harvey Milk""), Gus Van Sant and his cast bring a new immediacy to this story.",2008
10,"I never vibrated together with Van Sant, but this time I must say he convinced me.",2009
9,"I saw this last night at the Portland premiere with Gus Van Sant and James Franco among others. This is a powerful work and, in my opinion, Gus Van Sant has taken a big step towards the mainstream in his artistic direction. To me, the person who is by no means a movie expert, it seems that this movie had a much faster, accessible pace than his other movies. There were no long-shots or minutes at a time without dialog, etc.",2008
10,"""Milk"" is the best film of 2008, hands down. Anyone unfamiliar with the story of Harvey Milk and his murder needs to know it. Those of us who have already read a ton of books and articles about Harvey Milk, and seen the award-winning documentary ""The Times of Harvey Milk"" will find a side of Harvey we had not seen before in this movie so the film really is a must-see whoever you are.",2008
9,"'Milk' is another powerful mainstream American movie about gay experience. It seems destined to have the same kind of influence on the public mind as Jonathan Demme's 'Philadelphia' and Ang Lee's 'Brokeback Mountain,' both of which were prominent at Oscar time. Like them this isn't a great film but it's an important one.",2008
9,"Well I'm not sure if this movie will win anything but it certainly made a statement. Milk is about the first openly gay person, Harvey Milk, to be elected to office in America. Milk does a great job in putting face to the gay rights movement which is sorely needed.",2009
10,I remember back in 1978 when I heard about the assassinations in San Francisco. The screaming headlines read Mayor Moscone Murdered on the tabloid News and Post in New York. You read the article and it said that a San Francisco City Supervisor named Harvey Milk was also killed by another supervisor Dan White.,2008
10,"Born and raised in a southern, catholic community, I saw that homosexuals were always grouped with prostitutes and rapists in our religion books. Something didn't quite sit right with me when I saw this ever since I was very young. The anti gay feelings abound in a small southern city, and, although I myself am straight, I was always in the minority of gay right supporters.",2008
5,"Milk isn't a terrible movie--it's not even a bad movie--but it's nowhere near the level of gay masterpiece I hoped it would be. It's a conventional, unambiguous rallying cry with no real impact.",2008
10,"I watched this film last night and it had me in tears. If you don't know the story of Harvey Milk, then you really should. I had never heard of him until this film and I don't know why I hadn't. I'm not gay and feel quite uncomfortable watching other guys kissing, but have nothing against homosexuality. I didn't feel uncomfortable at all throughout this film and it really left me feeling very sympathetic for the gay community, and anyone who is persecuted for being different. Sean Penn delivers the most outstanding performance i have seen him deliver in ages, it should definitely warrant an Oscar! James Franco, Josh Brolin, Emile Hirch and Diego Luna also showing their brilliance. All the actors were incredible and to think that none of them (that i know of) are actually gay. It must take some serious ability to pull that one off so believably. Maybe I just don't have a gaydar and can't see it, so could someone who is gay let me know what he thought of their performance. Anyway, there is a lot to learn from this film, it shocks me to think this happened only a generation ago and we were all such an unaccepting bunch of idiots back then. However, it tells the entire story from an unbiased view. All the homophobes and 'bad guys' aren't just displayed as bad people, but always come across as being human, albeit ignorant, you can't blame someone for their ignorance. Gus Van Sant's direction as usual was fantastic, some very innovative and clever shots, and by using an old school camera through many parts of the film, could blend real historical footage and modern film seamlessly. One of the best films I have seen all year! I hope it does well and wins multiple awards, it definitely deserves it! Enjoy this film, it has really touched me.",2008
9,I very nearly gave this movie a miss. I'm pleased I didn't.,2008
10,"I cannot think of one bad thing to say about this movie (well, maybe it was a teeny bit too long). OK, now that THAT'S out of the way, let me just say I have not seen a better movie than this in some time. It's a powerful portrait of our history. The story of Harvey Milk is amazing and told with great skill and sensitivity in this film. The performances are superb. Most notably, Sean Penn disappears into the role of Harvey Milk. He made me forget I was watching Sean Penn play a character. The supporting performances are also incredible. Hirsch, Franklin, Brolin and Luna add wonderful support to the stellar cast. But it is Gus Van Sant who ties together the talent and excellent writing into this gem of a movie. See it at least once.",2008
10,"I thought that Mickey Rourke was supposed to get the Oscar, but after I found out that Sean Penn got it, I decided to watch the movie Milk. I haven't seen ""The Wrestler"" yet, but as far as ""Milk"" is concerned, it is an excellent biographical movie, and although I was not sure about Penn, he turned out to be great. A well deserved Oscar and an excellent cast. It teaches a major historical and political event for gays (the movie is based more on men) and teaches what people who are different than what most would consider ""normal"" have to go through. Costume design very good, they have stayed true to what was in fashion then. My favorite scenes are when they win the vote against the No 6 law, and the final scene where all gays holding candles walk the streets, mourning for Milk.My favorite quote: Dan White: Society can't exist without the family. Harvey Milk: We're not against that. Dan White: Can two men reproduce? Harvey Milk: No, but God knows we keep trying.",2009
9,"My wife and I saw Milk yesterday at the Castro Theater in SF -- right around the corner from Harvey's camera shop, where I met Harvey in 1973-4. For those of us who learned from Harvey about what it meant to be gay in America at that time, and who learned genuine acceptance and love, this movie is wonderfully evocative.",2008

7,"First of all, I recommend that people see this movie. I am a straight, married man, and I would recommend it to anyone. I am extremely happy that this movie was made. I was a child when these events took place, and I was fairly ignorant about Harvey Milk, knowing of his activism but not much about it.",2008
8,"I just saw an advance screening of Get Smart and it was great! It was  simply the best adaptation of a classic TV series for the big screen. I  don't know how to explain it but it successfully carried the tone that  the original series had. It was silly but not too silly and, at the  same time, a little serious but not too serious. Familiar characters,  props, music, jokes and lines all brought back fond memories of a  delightful TV series. And there were plenty of new elements in this  film that made it interesting and entertaining to watch.  Steve Carrell was terrific as Agent 86 and seemed to capture the  essence of Maxwell Smart. Not only did his portrayal of him resembled  that of Don Adams' from the sound of Smart's voice to the delivery of  Smart's lines, Carrell managed to inject a bit of his own personality  to create a new Smart that didn't stray too far away from the old.  Anne Hathaway was perfect as Agent 99. She did bear some resemblance to  Barbara Feldon and actually delivered her lines in a similar manner as  her at times. But more importantly, she had great chemistry with  Carrell. A key ingredient to Get Smart's success was Maxwell Smart and  Agent 99's chemistry and I'm glad the writers of this film didn't  forget that. Feldon and Adams had terrific chemistry and so too did  Hathaway and Carrell.   Unlike previous film adaptations of old television series that only  superficially resembled their TV series counterpart, this film can  truly be considered a big screen version of the Get Smart TV series.  Where Lost In Space, Mission Impossible, Charlie's Angels, Starsky and  Hutch and (have I missed anything?) have failed, this film succeeded in  maintaining the tone and style of the original series upon which it's  based. Moreover, the filmmakers managed to bring Get Smart up to date  without forgetting its roots. New ideas created for this film seemed to  be natural extensions of those used for the original series. Jokes,  props, music, characters and plot, old and new, all seemed to be born  from the Get Smart world.  I wish I could get into more details but I don't want to give anything  away. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and highly recommend this to  anyone, especially fans of the original TV series.",2007
8,"Yes, go see this movie. I know sometimes a preview looks pretty good and then the movie stinks (hello, Indiana Jones IV?) but this one does not disappoint.",2008
7,"As I was watching Get Smart, I came to the delighted realization that the filmmakers weren't trying to do a spy spoof here, but rather a loving tribute to spy movies with a lot of comedy thrown in. This is the right approach, as the now-tired Austin Powers franchise has pretty much run the spy spoof idea into the ground. Director Peter Segal (a veteran of many past Adam Sandler comedies) tries and succeeds at doing something rare. Get Smart is silly enough to work as a comedy, but at the same time, contains some truly impressive action sequences that would be right at home in just about any summer blockbuster that had a slightly more serious mind.",2008
8,"With loads of action, quirky humor, jazzy music, and shoe phones, Get Smart has admirably mimicked the blend of genres and innovations that made the original series so memorable, and while die-hard fans will likely pick apart what this re-envisioning doesn't get right, it's almost impossible not to laugh at Steve Carell's ludicrous on screen antics.",2008
10,"I saw a preview of ""Get Smart"" last week at Warner Brothers, and all my worries about what they would do with the great TV series vanished in the first few moments of the movie as Steve Carell enters Control through the famous doors, and so began one of the most hilarious comedies I have seen in a long time. To my added delight, I recognized Mel Brooks himself sitting in the back row and laughing along with everyone else! What a thrill for me that not only was I seeing an early screening of the movie, but enjoying it with my hero, the co-creator of my favorite TV show of all time. Carell and Hathaway are perfectly matched. They have somehow channeled the essence of Don Adams and Barbara Feldon. Carell is drop-dead funny throughout but especially in a scene in the airplane. We all kept laughing right into the next scene, but my favorite is a dance scene with Carell and 99 that will go down in movie history as a classic. Also, I keep remembering the hilarious scene when a kid in a car tries to call his mom's attention to Carell flying outside across the car window and she testily dismisses him. At the end of the movie there was loud applause. This is a summer blockbuster. P.S. Real fans should stay through the end of the credits because the movie is dedicated to Don Adams and Ed Platt.",2008
10,"I was lucky enough to catch a screening of 'Get Smart' and absolutely loved it. I saw the movie in Manhattan and there's nothing tougher than a New York audience, and the whole room was dying laughing throughout the film. I don't know what church group these nay-sayers saw the film with, but it is hilarious.",2008
7,"The first 10 minutes or so of ""Get Smart"" are kind of disappointing, and I thought ""here we go, another trailer that makes the film look better than it is"". But it improves greatly after that point, mainly after the first encounter of Max with Agent 99. Anne Hathaway is in some ways the life of this movie: she is incredibly sexy, with a magnificent back and legs to die for (or by), and completely believable in all her action scenes. Steve Carell has good comic timing; he may at times remind you of Leslie Nielsen in ""The Naked Gun"" and ""Spy Hard"" mode, but beyond that he manages to make Max a genuinely likable and human character, not just a cartoon. The relationship Max and 99 have formed at the end of the movie seems to be based more on friendship than anything else. The rest of the cast is generally well-chosen (although I didn't get the point of Bill Murray's 1-minute cameo); there is a big plot twist that allows one cast member to play against type, and even Dalip Singh (aka The Great Khali in WWE) comes off well, playing a huge indestructible henchman in the tradition of Jaws of ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" and ""Moonraker"".",2008
10,"Whether you watched the show during its original run, caught it in reruns over the years like I did, or you are a very recent fan of the series like my 9 year old son who watches all the seasons and original movies repeatedly, you will laugh hysterically at this movie. Just about every agent and character from the original series is here, from Agent 13 who gets stuffed in the oddest places to Fang, Max's dog from season one. The dialog, the gags, and the characters are pure Get Smart. I do not believe anyone could have come into Don Adams shoe phone better than Steve Carell. He perfectly carries off the almost debonair, yet not as clever as he thinks he is Agent 86. Anne Hathaway (who looks breathtaking in black leather) was awesome as Agent 99, completely playing the seasoned agent to Max's bumbling. Alan Arkin, Dwayne Johnson, and Terrance Stamp round out a great cast. I just hope though in the next movie we see more Hymie, one of my all time favorite characters. My family and I have been waiting over a year since the first trailer was shown for this movie,and it was well worth the wait. We will be seeing it many times over.",2008
3,"In yet another miserable attempt to make a quick Hollywood cash-in of one of televisions greatest masterpieces, Peter Segal has created a monster. Taken out of context, if one did not know Brooks' work before viewing, the movie would be a lame big budget film that isn't sure if it wants to be fat joke and stupid comedy, or just an ordinary action film with nothing to move on. However, as a young generation Y'er who just recently spent two months obsessing over the five seasons of Get Smart, the 60's TV show, this movie pained me from the moment I entered and saw Steve Carell dumbing down the part. The backstories, agent 99 getting plastic surgery and 86 as an analyst who was formerly morbidly obese, shames the complexity of the original duo and paints a flat boring reevaluation of them. It seems the screenwriters, unable to be truthfully funny in both dialogue and situation, fell back on lame set-ups for Don Adams famous lines, flashbacks to fat camp, references to Carell's part in the office in the interview style camera angles they have, and a female chauvinism that falls flat on its face.",2008
1,"The audience sat in silence through almost the entire film, with only a few, rare, occasional chuckles. The character of Maxwell Smart was so inconsistent, I felt whip-lashed. When it is convenient for the plot, Smart behaves like a master spy. At other times, he acts like an imbecile. They lift many classic lines from the television series, but they don't work in this version. The classic ""missed it by this much"" is funny if it is spoken with attempted braggadocio by someone who is an obvious failure - but it loses all humor when spoken by someone who is qualified. To a slightly lesser degree, many of the other characters move at a dizzying pace from skilled to cartoonish incompetent. Siegfried, the main villain, would seem to be intelligent, but he makes decisions that make no damned sense at all. Still, none of the characters in the film is as incompetent as the writers of this mess. I am utterly depressed that so many IMDb users think this was good.",2008
1,"This movie is in the same league as Ishtar. Lots of wasted talent. Who let this bomb escape? When Sigfried says an example has to be made, in reference to a nuclear bomb, I said ""Please let it be this theatre!"" Don't waste your time. Not even worth a free rental! And where did they get these shills to fill the comments section on IMDb? I can't believe that anyone who has ever seen the original series enjoyed this stinker. Steve Carell is not a physical comedian. If they removed the ""comedy"" and made it a straight action movie, it could pass. What the heck was the purpose of the dance scene? Also, the fat jokes and references were tasteless. This movie never missed a chance to go for the lowest common denominator and scenes just ended, it seemed, as if no one thought them through. Just awful! Save your time, if not money and give this movie a pass!",2008
1,"This movie sucked. The problem was not with the cast. I think the cast was great, lots of good talent, lots of great acting. But the script was TERRIBLE! It seemed to be mostly just a frame work in which Steve Carrell could do his improv. And that is what he does best, but it just didn't work here. The script was hard to follow, the story was non-sensical, and scenes were random and lacked direction. Also, much of the action was extremely contrived and poorly thought out. It was a good effort, but as Max says, they missed it by THAT MUCH! I am shocked to see how many glowing reviews there are for this stinker here on the IMDb. Obviously, the movie producers are getting people to write lots of positive reviews on their movies and fill up the entries on the IMDb. If you read the positive reviews and compare them to the negative reviews, it is pretty clear which ones are genuine reviews from normal users.",2008
5,"This movie made me laugh out loud on a few occasions. But between the laughs, which were few and far between, there wasn't a how lot in the way of entertainment. I enjoyed the reruns of the show as a child but Steve Carell doesn't so much take on the Max Smart role as much as he just changes the name of his Michael character from the ""Office"". Don't get me wrong I'm a huge ""Office"" fan and if this was ""Office"" the movie I'd be the first one in line, but this was suppose to be Get Smart. I was expecting a much more arrogant and pompous portrayal as was the classic Maxwell Smart. Overall it isn't a bad viewing if you've got nothing else to do, but don't go out of your way to catch this one.",2008
1,"Don't believe the hype. If you have high hopes or have anticipated this movie to any degree, you may be disappointed. Even the hilarious and talented Steve Carrell can't save this poorly written, over-long silly spy flick. For the purists (fans of the original TV series), this movie bears little resemblance to the original characters and influence. Agent 99 and Maxwell (except for their names) are simply not the same characters. There are several isolated references to the original, but not enough to convince this fan that it is anything more than a poor shadow of the TV version. For those not familiar with the original TV series, you may not be disappointed but chances are you will be bored. There are a few cheap Hollywood political shots as well (really pathetic and oh so typical for an election year). We left after the first hour and weren't alone. Some left after 20 minutes.",2008
10,"I got the chance to see this movie today,because it showed on an Army base. You can't get a tougher crowd than a military crowd! The crowd absolutely loved it. There were SEVERAL scenes that the crowd clapped and really laughed out loud. Personally, I thought it was one of the funnier movies I have seen in a long time. I think it was very well done.",2008
10,"I first saw this movie 2010, and I immediately fell in love with the humor and everything about the movie. I think I've watched it at least 20 times (enough to know most of the lines by heart) and I never get tired of it. It has a great story, although I have not watched the original series (which I really have to!) I can really say that it catches the originality. They have succeeded with the chemistry between Agent 99 and Max without making it too typical and at the same time combining this with all their adventures. I laughed all the time at the sarcasm and the accidents and all that in the movie, I can't really describe how much I enjoy this movie. Although I have to say that I'm really disappointed and also surprised that the movie got so bad ratings here on IMDb! This is a movie I will always remember and keep close to my heart!",2014
1,I'm afraid that I was forced to write this review because of the bullcrap reviews posted here by Steve Carrel fans and studio execs. They really went to town bigging up this turkey! Please pay NO HEED to the absolute lies posted in the positive reviews of this epic failure.,2008
1,What a sad surprise.,2008
1,"Get Smart should be titled Get Stupid. There is not one funny line or gag in the entire film. This film is so bad it makes the Austin Powers films look Shakespearean. A few more films like this and Steve Carell can kiss his career goodbye. As for Anne Hathaway, what is she doing in this film? She's a good actress but is just plain terrible.",2008
4,"While I was never a huge fan of the TV show ""Get Smart"", I did see plenty of episodes as a kid and am more than familiar with the show. Apparently, that is a lot more that can be said about the writers of this movie. Once again, Hollywood has made a film that bears very little similarity with the source material...other than the title and the names of the characters. So, at the outset, those who DO want to see a remake of the TV show are going to be rather disappointed. The problem I see is much like the problems with the ""Mission:Impossible"" films. The old shows were very plot driven, but with both these movie remakes, the movies are mostly driven by amazing special effects. The problem is, that these special effects have nothing to do with the show and the entire spirit of the source material is missing.",2009
1,"Yet another TV show becomes a movie. Steve {The Office} Carell plays dimwitted agent Maxwell Smart in a movie that's so bad, it makes the worst movie you ever saw become the second worst movie you ever saw. The seventh rate story- if you can call it that has a megalomaniac trying to take over the world. It is so unfunny, it is absolutely pathetic. About the only thing Anne Hathaway does as agent 99 is look good-she seems incapable of doing anything else. Bill Murray has the fine sense to limit his screen time to about 90 seconds, and a few faces from the TV series turn up in very small roles. Movie is supposed to be part thriller and part action film. It is neither. Even though I really was not a fan of the TV series, at least it was light years ahead of this piece of -hit. All this does is drag it through the dirt and cheapen whatever good memories we had of it. Thank God Don Adams is not here to see it. Keep it up Hollywood! Keep making crappy movies like this and keep sendin 'em to the multiplexes on a weekly basis. No wonder the film industry is going down the tubes. This movie is so rotten, it's NOT even good for laughs. If this movie were a newspaper, it could be used to line the bottom of a bird cage. There is absolutely no reason to see this movie. A root canal is more enjoyable than this.! Rating- zero minus five stars. Unless you are a Masochist, STAY AWAY. Better still, do what the title says- Get Smart and save your nine bucks. You will be able to buy about 2 gallons of gas with it. Put it in your car and be thankful you did not waste it going to a multiplex to see this bomb!",2008

2,Lame....that's the only word I can use to describe this comedic disaster. Anne Hathaway's gorgeous legs can only carry her so far in this movie and Steve Carrell's Don Adams impressions fall way short of any testament to a great bumbling secret agent of days gone past.,2008

In this Swedish film, adapted from John Ajvide Lindqvist's bestselling book, director Tomas Alfredson dares to mix pleasure and pain in a way that is both horrifying and tender.",2008
10,"So many people reviewing this film on IMDb seem to focus on the sweet friendship between it's 12 year old human and vampire leads. While this is a huge element of the film, this is a sweet story of childhood friendship in the same way 'The Godfather' is the story of a fathers concerns and worries for his kids; both true descriptions, its just that you would be missing the point if you came away from either film thinking that is what you had seen.",2008
10,"I am not particularly fond of the vampire genre, but this movie is so much more. It is artistic, poetic, and in many ways a very profound movie exploring the nature of good and evil. It does so through the world of a child where both pure evil and pure goodness are somewhat discernible, and it achieves an astounding array of contrasts that allow us to see that good and evil can coexist side by side. Doing so, this movie is very thought-provoking, leaving the audience yearning to read the novel. In short, this movie is a gem. There is no need to remake this movie which according to IMDb.com they will be. You don't need to wait until 2010, you should watch this movie now.",2008
10,I have watched both Twilight and Let the Right one in.,2008

9,"I saw several movies at the Seattle International Film Festival this year, and Let the Right One In was by far my favorite of the bunch. It's primarily a movie about how friendship can help you find your own personal strength. Two lonely children meet and change each other's lives. The fact that one is a vampire makes the movie even more interesting and unique, but it's not the most important plot detail. The cold darkness of Sweden makes the perfect backdrop for the story. It was so refreshing to see a vampire movie that doesn't rely upon cheap scares, fangs and gore. The only scene I didn't enjoy involved cats with computer animated faces - it looked very stupid and out of place, but this was a small disappointment in an otherwise outstanding film. I highly recommend this movie.",2008
10,"At it's worst ""Let the Right One In"" is far too subtle and slow and nothing like typical horror movies, (if it should be considered one.) At its best its one of the better films we've seen in the last decade. As a foreign film it should see wider American distribution and publicity than any such film since""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."" ",2008
10,"I had just finished reading the book when i went to see this movie. I had big expectations, which i didn't want to have because than you can get disappointed, but oh my god was i happy when it was even better than i expected. Every second of the movie is just brilliant film-making, thanks to Tomas Alfredson who has proved that he is a master. Also the acting is great and believable, and the cinematography and music is beautiful. There was some things that i missed from the book that wasn't in the movie, but i expected that. This movie is a masterpiece and every single human being should see it. Well perhaps not every singe one since this is a horror movie, don't see it with your young ones.",2008
9,"I saw this movie yesterday at the official premiere at the Rotterdam Film Festival in Holland. I didn't know anything beforehand, and i was blown away. The film is a strange mix; it includes romantic elements, horror. Kisses and love, but also blood and death. And it's told in a straightforward manner, as if this all was very normal and like every film is made like this.",2008
9,This film was the main reason for my attending Frightfest in London this year and I was not disappointed. From the opening shot you realise that you are in for something special. The film is set in (a very cold) Sweden in the early 1980s and the writer of the novel/screenplay has confessed that it is semi-autobiographical and based loosely on his own childhood. I'm guessing that the inclusion of a vampire in the story is what takes this away from being simply autobiographical.,2008
10,"This review may be seen as containing spoilers – I don't think it does but a warning just in case. Be wary of genre classifications here: to call this a mere vampire film without qualification would be a disservice. A vampire film it is, but one that belongs to a very select club. Midway through, I imagined the ghosts old Bela and Tod Browning hobnobbing with a Mr Bergman, all three of them living up every moment of this elegant little tale of horror. With minimal special effects, no flashy editing and cinematography that leaves its imprint on your mind for days, Alfredson's layered film about cruelty and goodness, exclusion and marginality – for both vampire and human alike – is told through the unlikely friendship of two 12-year-old loners. One, Oskar, albino-like in his white blondness, is bullied at school. The other, Eli, a dark, unkempt and unorthodox girl vampire, teaches him to stand up for himself. In the background is the strange, devoted, slightly bumbling Hakan, Eli's human protector and blood gatherer. He strings his victims up, cuts them open then siphons their blood into jerricans for Eli to drink. He passes as her father. (Is he?)",2008
10,This movie is good.,2008
9,"""Let the right one in"" is just a very huge surprise and a plain beautiful movie. You can always judge how much impact a movie has when you watch the crowd in the cinema while the credits roll and in this one barely anyone dared to stand up and go... I guess they were all busy swallowing their tears because this movie is a real tearjerker.",2008
10,"A major issue with horror films is their inherently being trapped in some corner of the genre. Vampire films are to a degree less prone to this because they are almost always based in relationships. Their power at times depends on the quality shown in these relationships developing, both human and not.",2008
10,"In a nutshell, the movie is not about vampires at all. Yes there is violence but it is the kind of violence which is comes across as an absolute necessity. It often feels that the violent scenes are almost apologetic in nature. This is a movie about life, love and everything in between. The movie is very ""crisp"" and focused with every emotion being ""sharpened"" by the age of its characters, the cinematography and pureness of the actors portrayal of their characters.",2008
7,"I read the book and loved it. Now, I had the chance to see the movie version at the Gothenburg International Filmfestival 2008, as the movie won the ""Nordiska filmpriset"". I saw it at a really big screen (700 seats), happy that it delivered fine acting and quality cinema.",2008

9,"Let the Right One In is poignant, sad, weird, different, elusive, as well as being a fine movie. Oskar is a blond 12-year-old who lives with his divorced mother in an apartment complex in Stockholm. He's bullied incessantly at school. Neither his mother nor his father seems to have much time for him. He's a quiet kid who dreams of getting back at his tormentors. He doesn't seem to have any friends. Then an older man and a child move into the apartment building. Her name, we learn, is Eli. She's 12 years old, too, pale, and at times looks haggard. Oskar meets her one evening in the playground in front of the apartment complex. Snow is deep on the ground. The weather is freezing. The cold doesn't bother Eli. By now we know Eli is a vampire. Oscar realizes this later. ",2008
8,"Thematically rich ""Låt Den Rätte Komma In"" hits refresh on the vampire genre with an interesting outlook on character and its development.

Generally moody and calm on its almost 2 hour running time, audiences will be spellbound if not disinterested.",2008

I read that this is his first book and after watching this movie I must read it. I'm guessing the book is good and I can certainly say that the movie is brilliant. One of the best European and world movies of 2008. (at least an Oscar nominee for 'Best foreign film'...) ,2008
10,"Saw this at FantasticFest 2008. This is a perfect example of storytelling. I cannot say enough good about this film. Effective in the simplest ways, never beats you over the head with the vampire idea, yet goes where so many blood-sucker movies haven't - I saw interesting, simple questions raised in the vampire-mythos that no one else has touched upon - along with stylish nods to many old fairy-tales and fantasy stories.",2009
9,"Seen at the International Film Festival in Rotterdam. Very original plot! And the result: a surprising movie in a genre of realistic triller/horror. It explores the life of a vampire child, or as she puts it: ""I love on blood, so yes"" (she is a vampire).",2008

Lousy acting, laughably bad dialogue and a story which is just downright stupid combine to make one terrible movie.",2009
2,"I hate this. I want to tell you guys that this was Shyamalan's comeback and that this film is just as terrifying as you've been promised. But, I cannot.",2008
1,"M. Night Shyamalan's first Rated R film and he blew it completely, I remember this year actually wanting to see this movie, it looked really interesting and Mark Wahlberg is becoming a more great actor in his experience. The only problem here is M. Night Shyamalan, this man is constantly credited for Signs and The Sixth Sense... that's it, because that and Unbreakable are his only good movies. Honestly, he's just loosing it, I think he's become so cocky and now he's trying to have more of an edge with this R rating. His story lacks any sense, there are just so many things wrong with this story and not to mention the characters have no sympathy. Nothing was ever properly explained and there are tons of plot holes. The ending was just a cop out, it was nice to see that Shyamalan didn't go for his typical ""twist"" ending, but still this story just needed so much work and probably would've been better under someone else's name.",2008
4,"Shyamalan has proved to us earlier that he can be as good as the best with masterpieces of cinema with The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. Yet, since then, he has declined steadily. Signs and Village were good movies, but with Lady in the Water and now The Happening, he has touched a level of incompetence that could never have been expected of him.",2008
1,"Let me preface these comments by saying that I am a major Night fan. I look forward to news of his next project and love the stories of his supposed total control over his movies and carte blanche from the studios. If those stories are true, I have a feeling that era will be ending for Night with the release of The Happening. I ignored all the pre-release press I could before going to see this movie. I read none of the reviews, but one word I did catch was ""uninspired."" Unfortunately, that one word describes this movie perfectly. In the first ten minutes of the movie, I thought it was due to the acting and that maybe Mark Wahlberg was miscast. However, after another ten minutes I realized it wasn't the actors; it was the extremely lame script. Without giving away any details, this is a disaster film where the disaster ""happening"" starts with the first scene of the movie. Unfortunately, no suspense builds and there is absolutely no sense of dread or panic on screen and so none translates to the audience. Surprising, since the 21st century has provided us with too many occasions to study how we react in times of disaster, whether by nature or terrorism. It's as if Night ignored all this when writing the story. The characters sleepwalk through the scenes (and, no, it's not a symptom of ""the happening"") with no believable sense of the horrible events taking place. Granted, we don't need to see people running around in circles screaming and crying, but people do not stand in small groups after a disaster calmly taking turns talking one at a time. Without sharing in any of the horror that the characters are suppose to be experiencing, the film is a total bore for the audience and the source of ""the happening"" is laughable when revealed. I found myself repeatedly checking my watch, saying, ""I can't believe how bad this is""  not something I'd expect to do in a Night movie. Looking around the theater, I could tell others were sharing the same feelings. Most were scrolling through emails or texting on their phones.",2008
2,"What can I say. This movie sucked. Not even Mark Wahlberg, whom I rate as a great actor, could save this turkey.",2008
6,"When I first saw the trailer for 'The Happening', I was quite excited at the prospect of another film by M. Night Shyamalan. After all, I enjoyed all his previous films, save 'Lady in the Lake', and was sure he would deliver another breath-taking blockbuster. Sadly, I was wrong and while the film was not a turkey, it was not of the excellence I had expected.",2008
10,"I was disappointed to see such harsh reviews from the critics when there are clearly much sillier and stupid films out there. ""Zohan"" was about 60% at rotten tomatoes, while ""The Happening"" was at 14%. The disappointment didn't last long when I realized, given the information above, if critics had liked this movie, that might have been a bad thing. I focused my attention on interviews with Shyamalan himself talking about the film instead of the pretentious critics who have grown accustom to hating his movies. I decided to take HIS advice and go into the theater looking for a ""fun B movie"". ",2008
5,"I'm a Shyamalan fan. He's not afraid to take chances. And he believes in himself and his story. Most of the time, that helps. Gems like Unbreakable en The Village would never have seen the light of day if someone other than Shyamalan came up with it. His direction always makes sure his story gets the maximum effect. I like his screenplays because they always consist of two things: originality and well written characters. His new feature has neither. It's that simple. As a Shyamalan fan, I felt this disappointment a little with Lady in the Water. But now, it's twice in a row.",2008
8,"I'm surprised this movie is getting as many bad reviews as it appears to be getting... but the occasional good review is very telling, especially Ebert's. I'd recommend reading his review because in my opinion he 'got it', and no need to repeat his observations here.",2008

She isn't cheating on him, but, as Elliot explains a few minutes later, she seems, ""distant."" It is their growing distance that begins the ""event."" The colors on the mood ring, and their symbolic meanings, are as follows: Blue: Reserved, tranquil, calm, believed to keep the bad spirits away. Yellow: Sign of hope, happiness, unpredictable. Green: Life, nature, great intelligence, seen as a lucky color.",2008

If you're sifting through reviews to find a reason to watch it, don't. It's normal for a film to have cynics and skeptics, but in this case every criticism is well earned. The acting? Nope. The plot? No. And the dialogue? Hell no. ",2015
1,"M. Night Shyamalan started with a great idea for this movie: Mother Nature taking revenge on mankind for abusing the planet. This could have been a truly amazing film.

In terms of quality, this movie makes Manos: the Hands of Fate look like the Silence of the Lambs.",2008

7,"When I saw this movie, I thought it was really good but then, I watched it again and realized it was only worth seeing once. Since I know that M. Night had made the film with the goal of getting an R rating, it was clear that the graphic violence was over the top and highly unrealistic. Although this movie was intended for adults, younger teens would enjoy this movie more. The movie also didn't have a great ending and wasn't a great moral to life but it was entertaining I half to say. M. Night has done better movies such as The Sixth Sense and Signs but this movie wasn't as bad as everyone said it was but it was one of those movie were you would sneak into the theater just to take a peek at what all the excitement was.",2009

They were scared, they jumped in their seats and they laughed at the many humorous moments. Everything seemed to work and I wasn't alone at the theater in having fun with this film. Mark Wahlberg and cast are totally believable innocents, so much so that you really care about their almost-naive characters. ",2008
1,"The Happening is by far Shamylan's WORST. I mean it's just so laughably terrible and hopelessly dull. It's void of any kind of quality filmmaking or anything that's remotely interesting. And I like Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel both as actors, but their performances in this film are just plain god awful, you're watching it and the whole time you're just looking to yourself my goodness are they even giving any attempt at all to be good? Because their performances either look like just a bad acting from a TV horror movie or purposefully bad from an SNL skit. And even if this movie was trying to be bad on purpose in order to be comical, it would still fail miserably. There is just nothing at all of any value in this movie. I mean there's just nothing good about, it there's absolutely no reason for you to watch this movie. Scene by scene by scene it just seems to get progressively worse. A lot of times, you hope that just the beginning of the movie is bad and that as it progresses, it will get better. Well save your hopes for another day, because there is no point in hoping for that with this film. The plot actually interested in me and I thought that it would be intriguing. This may be the worst case I've seen of an interesting plot being completely wasted. 1/10.",2017
3,"I think the only reason this particular M. Night film did as well as it did was the fact it was R rated. That sure was the main thing they pushed prior to its release, which should have been an indication that the studio did not really think much of this one. I sure did not after viewing this one. That is not completely fair, I was intrigued for the first fifteen or so minutes, but there really was not all that much happening in this one. It stars Mark Wahlberg whom for a time I kept going to his movies and I kept being disappointed. The last one I saw was ""Max Payne"" and I have not seen a film of his since having learned my lesson. I just do not care for him as he is the same guy in every film, a surly dour faced prick even when he is supposed to be a school teacher as he was in this one. Well things are happening as people begin dying, apparently killing themselves and in not so interesting ways. The scene where the people start falling to their deaths is almost amusing as it looks like something out of a Scary Movie film. John Leguizamo is okay in this movie and actually helps the film, but he is knocked out relatively early. So what is happening? Well I am not going to say, but the movie spells it out for you about halfway at most and it is completely idiotic. It makes the fact the characters are running here and there particularly stupid as well as the cause is all around them at some points and yet nothing happens to people in some areas while ten feet away it does! The film ends with a whimper, but at least there is no twist at the end, no M. Night this time went with the sort of twist relatively early. So while it starts out briskly it ends with a thud. It still irks me how pitiful that lawnmower scene played out as I imagined it a lot cooler and gruesome than it turned out. Me seeing this film again, likely not happening.",2011
8,"Although, several people did not like this film, I have to say that I enjoyed it tremendously. From the beginning of the film, you become hooked. It was incredible to see that only a few minutes into the film, you witness the strange event happening so soon. When the people in Central Park become affected by the chemicals, they look like they are frozen in time. Then the real horror begins. As I watched it got me thinking about years back when sea creatures began ""killing themselves"" by beaching themselves. There was no explanation for this event in the first place and it created quite a stir. Many marine biologists theorized that there might been some type of bacteria or threat in the ocean that caused it to happen",2009

10,"M. Night Shyamalan has created a very original story with a lot of creative ideas, amazing tone and brilliant shock and suspense scenes that would make even Hitchcock proud. So why all the hate for such an awesome movie? The only conclusion I can come up with is that either people just love to hate on Shyamalan, as was evident with The Village, or they just wanna see more rehashing. People must love love all of the sequels(Indiana Jones 4, The Incredible Hulk), remakes and adaptations(Speed Racer, Iron Man), and the straight forward rip-offs(The Strangers, The Ruins), etc. etc. Don't get me wrong, I liked most of these movies with the exception of the rip-offs and Speed Racer but The Happening is far superior because it actually has originality. It truly, in my opinion, is the greatest movie of 2008 so far and maybe the best movie of the past few years.",2008
8,"I'm appalled at the way the specialized and not so specialized media attacked Tom Cruise for this movie. Why? He's not just good but very good in his against type performance. I've heard critics calling him ""distractingly bad"", how ridiculous and nasty. The film by the great craftsman Bryan Singer is a suspenseful, beautifully made historical thriller with a remarkable attention to detail. In an effort to be accurate the Jews are never mention because in fact the attempt to assassinate Hitler had nothing to do with that. The real reason? The war had turned against the Germans, it was clear that they were entering a down spiral and Hitler's madness was at the center of that. Regardless of the fact we know how the story ends, the movie manages to be a gripping tale based on real events. Well done Mr.Cruise, you won! Your Valkyrie is performing stupendously at the almighty box office.",2009
8,"First, I want to say that some time ago I learned to distrust critics and instead read the reviews here on IMDb. I've never been misled, even when an equal number of viewers liked and disliked the same movie because that let me know there was a matter of taste in play, and that's fine. Sometimes a movie pleases everyone, but that's so rare I cant really think of one. People have different tastes and that's good. But the value of IMDb reviews is that they are based on a genuine response to the movie - not a bias, or some other agenda.",2008
10,"""Valkyrie"" takes on an important event in the history of Nazi Germany: the failed assassination attempt of German officers of the Wehrmacht against Hitler in 1944. Most Germans like myself are quite familiar with the story of the ""Stauffenberg-Attentat"" since it was not only the topic of many German docudramas (e.g. one made by well-known director Pabst in 1955) but is also widely discussed in history class in school. ",2008
10,"Ignore the silly comments of some critics who want this movie to fail.  Schickel, Ebert and the L.A. Times got it right. If you're a World War  II history buff like me, you'll appreciate the fine effort that is  Valkyrie. It shows that American filmmakers as unlikely as Tom Cruise  and Bryan Singer can compete with the likes of the Downfall creators in  handling such subject matter. Like World War II itself, the full story  of the July 20 plot is long and intricate and cannot be fully told in  the confines of a two hour feature film. There are certainly many  peripherals to the story - its tentacles ran deep into the Nazi  diaspora; thousands were executed or ""disappeared"" (including Irwin  Rommel who was not portrayed in the film) - to say nothing of the mixed  motives in those Germans wishing to see Hitler dead. These are all  subjects that have already been explored and no doubt will be again in  the future. Suffice to say, Singer and editor/composer John Ottman  focused on the heart of this story: Hitler was destroying  Germany/Europe and the July 20 plotters bucked the odds to stop him.  The performances from this exceptional cast are first rate. Think what  you want about Tom Cruise and Scientology - I'm no big fan of either -  but judge the work on its merits. Cruise may not win an Oscar for his  portrayal of von Stauffenberg, but he more than gets the job done. In  terms of scope, the locations, battle scenes, costumes/uniforms,  staging/settings, you can't ask for more in a WWII movie. There's  nothing fake, nothing phony to spoil the period experience and vfx are  seamless as they should be. If you're expecting a formula Hollywood  thriller a la Bourne or M.I., you may be disappointed, but as a serious  adult drama Valkyrie delivers the goods. It took some balls to make  this movie and UA has earned its kudos.",2008
7,"I was curious about this movie since it had caused so much controversy with Tom Cruise in the main role. Personally I think he was after all not a bad choice for this part and all in all I am very happy that there is an American movie that shows the different side of Germany and Germans in the Third Reich (there was a time when in every Hollywood Movie the villain were always Germans). But Americans, who in general don't really have much understanding of history, fail to realize that Hitler wasn't voted into power by the people. As a matter of fact, he only received 36,8 % of the votes in the election. Though this made his party the leading one, he could only gain power because the politicians of the other parties thought they could control him. Once Hitler was able to turn Germany into a dictatorship, it was extremely difficult to form any resistance. So much as cracking a joke about the Fuehrer was reason enough to be imprisoned, investigated and executed. Organizing a conspiracy meant risking not only your life, but the life of everyone even remotely associated with you. And you could never be sure who you could trust or who might be a spy or simply rat you out for personal gain. This is where this movie falls a little short, because it shows Stauffenberg and others simply talking freely about their plans and their convictions. Yes, I get that it is very difficult to portrait this conflict and the tremendous danger in a two hour movie, but I can't help it, I just feel that it doesn't give the audience a real picture of how daring this operation was and how nerve wracking this must have been (remember, this was the third attempt of Stauffenberg. He had the explosives with him two times before and had to abort ... each time risking detection). If you really think this through, you can not have enough respect for their courage. And I can't help but to point out, that most people don't even have the civil courage to demonstrate and protest in a free country with a democratic government.",2009

I saw this movie with my 9 year old son who is a big Military Fan. In the eyes of a 9 year old boy - the World consists of ""Good Guys"" and ""Bad Guys"". I hope that this movie will allow him to recognize that the World is little more complex than ""Black & White"" or ""Good & Bad"". This movie is the first film I have ever seen that presents German People as human beings trapped in the wheels of a spinning war machine, and not merely monsters responsible for all WWII atrocities. The movie illustrates political ties and relationships between Army and SS which were at the heart of Hitler's grip on the Reich.",2008

I love walking out of the theater hearing the teenagers go ""What the heck?! I thought Hitler was going to die!"", I bow my head in shame. I know that there were a lot of people who had a thing about Tom Cruise being the leading man, which I have to admit I had a few questions, but you cannot deny despite his madness, he is a good actor over all. I admit he can be cocky, but he got the film done with pretty decent taste. I just have to laugh though because in this film we have every kind of accent there is: American, English, German, EVEN POLISH! A Polish Nazi? LOL, I'm sure that history must be proud of this movie. But over all it's a decent representation of the attempted assassination of Adolf Hitler.",2009

3,"Certainly the most miscast, and probably the most misconceived, War film I have ever seen. Director Bryan Singer made a modern classic with ""The Usual Suspects"" ,but his milieu is television. This comes across as a big budget / low brain effort which pulverises an essentially good story into pulp. At the heart of everything is the casting and accents. A predominantly British cast play the Germans in strong British accents, Cruise plays Stauffenberg with an American accent that veers into British from time to time. Consequently the whole film feels like a giant fancy dress party.",2010

8,"Forget all the negative hype surrounding Valkyrie, because I assure you it is false. Bryan Singer has made a well-crafted thriller that kept me and my family on the edge of our seats until the end  even though we all know what the story's unfortunate outcome. Also, many tabloids were making this out to be the movie that would permanently cripple the career of Tom Cruise. This is entirely false. Cruise delivers a fine performance, and this hatred I can only assume is related to his rather odd personal life. Tom Cruise is as strong of an actor as he ever was, and I won't let something like turning Oprah's couch into a playground deny the fact that the man has talent, and is a truly passionate actor (and seriously, he does have a slight resemblance to Stauffenberg).",2009

He joins them and conspires and executes a plot to assassinate Hitler using Operation Valkyrie which holds key to the usage of reserved army in crisis.",2009

The whole cast was powerful, that being said I felt that it could have been a little longer. I wish the film spent more time with Tom's character so we could know a little bit more about him but with the screen time he had he made it clear that their were two sides. Those who wanted to over throw Hitler and where Men of action and those who just wanted to sit around talking about doing it. It is clear that Tom's character was driven by taking action, just wished we knew a little bit more about him.",2008

7,"This is a fine movie about the July 20 plot of 1944 made with magnificent American-British-German actors and great production values. The picture contains a brief biographical remarks about Claus Schenk Graf Von Stauffenberg life(1907-1944), his wife(Van Hooten) and sons but focusing mainly the July Plot. The film packs a colorful cinematography by Newton Thomas Siegel and atmospheric musical score by John Ottman, also film-editor.This story about Stauffenberg and the famous event from how was orchestrated the dangerous plot has been well directed by Brian Singer(X men). Another versions about this fateful tale are: the classic version(1955) by G.W. Pabst with Bernhard Wicki as Stauffemberg, an American TV movie starred by Brad Davies and German adaptation titled 'Stauffemberg(2004)' with Sebastian Koch, Christopher Buchold and directed by Jo Baier who bears special remembrance to 'Valkyrie'.",2009
7,Bryan Singers film about the plot to kill Hitler is a very good one. (SPOILERS AHEAD),2009
8,Indeed this mission was impossible. This movie is named after a Wagner composition. Wagner gave verve to the German spirit during WWII with its driving musical compositions. But this Valkyre tune is also the name of the operation of the defense forces which would help to replace the German Government after Hitler were to be killed by whomever. There was a plan to protect the integrity of the German Government should Hitler die for any reason. Van Stauffenberg attempted to control this operation already in place and to place himself in control of it when Hitler were to be killed.,2008

8,First let me address some of the previous posters? Why on earth do you need to have a German accent? I have lived in many countries and I have never seen a movie dubbed with a phony accent or I have never seen a German movie about America with phony American accent in German. Let's establish the fact that the movie is not done in German. Done. Not German. If it is done in English then it should be English and not some Hogan's Heroes nonsense.,2008
8,"When I first saw the trailer for Valkyrie, I said to myself, ""plenty of potential, but it looks like it will be wasted."" I was offered a the chance to see the film a couple times but turned away since it didn't look too promising to me. But I finally succumbed and decided to give the film a shot and see how it would hold up. After quietly leaving the theater with my friend, I can say this was a very nice surprise; and I'd encourage anyone curious to see the film to do so.",2009
9,"When it comes to paranormal-shows (or more specifically ghost hunting shows) I think I've seen quite a few of it. Ghost Hunters (which is probably the most popular ghost hunting show nowadays), Most Haunted, and a few others come to mind. However, what I think distinguishes these shows from Ghost Adventures is the fact that Ghost Adventures has a lot more entertainment-value.",2009
8,"I'm a huge fan of paranormal television programs and this one has got me hooked! The team locks themselves in some of the most haunted places overnight but first will spend a little time in the town learning about the location and the people there. Even though I feel the trio (Zak, Nick, and Aaron) could do more ""debunking"" when it comes to many things that occur, this show is raw and is sure to win over the skeptic in you (at least with some of the evidence). You'll find many of their reactions during lockdown humorous. The three can overdo it a bit. You see their raw reactions...no scripts. Be prepared for some bleeping...these boys hold nothing back...and also hearing the word ""Dude"" at least a hundred times. I wholeheartedly suggest you check this program out. It pulls you in, regardless if you love them or hate them. You won't be able to wait for the commercials to be over.",2009
10,"Zak Baggans,Nick Groff, and Aaron Goodwin are out on a quest to catch proof of paranormal evidence by going to some of the most haunted places across the world from country music bars to abandoned insane asylums. They go in first to learn about the place then they the three are locked down inside for an entire night trying to catch ghosts on video and on audio. This show is really scary and really gets you to wonder about the after-life. Of course one cannot help being skeptical at points in the shows, however they still do hold a very convincing tone to it. I think it tops all of those other ghost shows. Especially the god-awful Ghost Hunters. I think that's what it's called, but it's the one where its the group one thousand British people and all it does is bore you rather than scare you. Watch them jump at barely audible noises, such as creaky floor boards and other non-scary stuff. Some criticism arrives from the show, but the evidence that tries to reveal them as fakes holds very weak and makes me want to see these skeptics locked down in a place ridden with demons. What gives Ghost Adventures a good scary edge is the taunting of evil spirits that mainly Zal Baggans does. In one episode he is physically attacked!! That is something that never happens on other ghost shows. Some deniers claim that they are actors. Well just to be honest, Zak and Nick have tried to become actors, however, that's complete B.S to bring up against them because a lot of people do stuff like that to get noticed. Like reporters who do stuff on purpose to get noticed or movie stars saying outrageous crap to get put in the headlines (example: Owen Wilson's suicidal thoughts. Angelina Jolie trying to become a lesbian.I could go on, but I don't think I will !!). Also to clear stuff up,I can safely say that these three kids aren't the only ones behind the show. I'm pretty sure there are people responsible for selecting the locations, writing the show's narration, and traveling with them. The three do go in for lock downs by themselves though. They also probably have some sort of creative direction behind the show. These guys can't run a Travel Channel show completely!! No one can for any show!! Even if it is reality. This show is really great and can be funny at times listening to their ""Woah.... dude, bro"" reactions as well as Zak's delightful personality. For instance when they are in the Houghton Mansion in the Masonic Temple part, Aaron bumps into this small altar and Zak jokes, ""Woah, dude , that thing might have powers.."" And think that's okay, because that's where this show gets it's charm from.",2010
2,"I watch almost all paranormal documentaries out there. Sadly, this is one of the worst. They to try to portray themselves as investigators but there is nothing scientific or objective in their approach. They might use technical gadgets but that in no way legitimizes the process.",2017
7,"between wanting to laugh at and being seriously intrigued by this show. When these guys really get into this I feel like I'm watching Bill and Ted's Excellent Ghost Hunting Adventure. ""Dude! Dude! Did you hear that? Whoa!"". I think that a lot of what goes on here is them (in particular Zac) reacting to their environment. Also the creative editing that is done afterward emphasizes a great deal. Despite that, there are moments when I feel they are actually making contact with the other side. ",2010
10,"If Ghost Adventures had their own church, I would be there every Sunday and Wednesday service and more than likely every single pie pickin bake sale!! This show ROCKS!!!! Premise is simple: 12 hours, one haunted place and 3 tubular dudes with video cameras who are locked in from dusk till dawn (sweet movie.) It can't get any better. Personally, I don't doubt them one bit. Their not there to prove a haunting or dismiss it, they're just their to capture the legends on film. The locations are credible, you've probably even seen them on other paranormal shows which even makes them more credible! As for their evidence, they break it down immediately after it happens sometimes playing it over a few times or at a slower pace and if they catch anything really spooky like a full apparition, it's analyzed to death because ultimately that's the main goal is to show you that what they get is REAL. It's also nice to have just 3 regular normal guys interacting with you through the show than a bunch of pocket protector scientists whom you can't even understand. Zak, Nick and Aaron are just like you which makes the series even better. They do the exact same thing my friends and I do on the weekends and it's so awesome to know that we're not the only ones who do that crazy crap!! I love them, can't get enough of them and hope it's on air forever!!",2010
1,"This show is so obviously faked. They tried to claim that a guy from the 1600s attacked them and then said ""I just slapped you bitches."" Yes, because men from the 1600s obviously talked like a modern day frat boy. Suuuure. Oh, and there was also the time they tried to claim that they caught ghosts having sex. Ghosts. Having sex.

9,"This show appeared on the Netflix Instant watch on XBox live. So i gave it a shot. The very first episode i watched was the Poveglia Island in Italy, and i have to say i thought that some parts were a little ""iffy"". So i decided to give it another watch and immediately i was hooked on this gem of a show. I have never seen or heard a ghost in my life, but this show really makes me believe in them. Zac pretty much taunts the ghosts to come out and hurt him and his crew, I really believe these guys genuinely WANT to prove the existence of the paranormal, which is very refreshing to see. I highly recommend this show to anyone who wants a good scare, or just something kind of interesting to watch. They tend to get some extremely creepy EVP's on every episode.",2010
5,"This show is very good when you need a really big laugh. These cast freak over everything they hear or see. Last night i watched this show and could not stop laughing. I thought Zak Nick and Aaron were way to serious. It seemed every noise they heard they thought it was paranormal. I've watched ghost hunters and they seemed more professional and they are very good at debunking. This show is horrible at debunking and being professional, like i said last night i watched it they thought this noise was a moaning and clearly it was an owl. Zak and his crew need to calm down.They can make you laugh and smile, but they will not scare you.overall I gave this 5 stars because it was entering funny not scary and exciting.",2010

3,"I basically only watch this show when I want to laugh at incompetent cowards. As a ghost hunter of many years, I cannot possibly tell you how unprofessional these people are, or how they would never be accepted by any real group based on their habit of screaming alone. Never mind the way Zak is rude to the ghosts and cusses way too much. Their ""evidence"" is almost always very weak and inconclusive. I honestly can't tell if they're actually trying or faking everything.",2012

10,"1st to comment! Best show ever! I love everything about it.. 100% real, nothing faked hear like other shows... Zak is great! There is three people that go out and investigate actual haunted spots. Zak, Nick and Aaron. They always seem to capture something. My favorite is the pilot episode which a actual block gets thrown at them. They review the tape and you can clearly see that there is no string, no hands, no trickery, just a block flying at them with force from a evil entity. This is truly my favorite show. I cannot wait for Friday nights on the Travel Channel. These 3 individuals do not use a camera crew and are only supplied with their own personal cameras and equipment. They then do history on the haunted places and lock themselves in with actual locks for the entire night. Very creepy yet very entertaining. This show makes me believe again! I recommend it 100%",2008
1,"I believe and watched (past) this show and then it came apparent they are clearly using Power of Suggestion. What is their background, Where did they do their studies to become ""professionals"" of the supernatural? If the cow chips they are serving was any deeper they would be professional Dairymen. Zak is so full of himself its laughable. Goofball, the new 3 Stooges (along with whomever they pull into their show). He is a perfect example when describing somebody that has let their success go to their head. And who picked out his frames? Somebody should tell him. And in order to comment on this show it has to be 10 lines well its definitely not all that to say that many. They should take it down a notch and try to be a little more believable, professionals. So people really do have abilities and they are not them. Just Sayin'",2016
7,"I love the paranormal. I don't know if it's fake or not it just interests me. I've been watching this show on and off since 2008. I love all the stories and experiences. The show does a good job with the history of the places they investigate. They always get a good amount of ""evidence"" which is cool. I've seen some other paranormal investigating shows and they never get any evidence. Of course when something happens they get freaked out a little. It's fun to watch them get scared. I don't know if the show is fake but even if it was I think it's still entertaining. It's like going to the movies to see a scary movie. You know it's all fake but you still like it. The only thing I do not like about the show is Zak. He's a total d*****bag. He thinks he's so cool. He's one of those guys who wears tapout and affliction (yeah one of THOSE guys) and honestly he can be really rude sometimes to the people they interview. He's even rude to the ghosts! I think if the show dropped him it would be so much better. Nic (nik?) and Aaron could definitely keep the show going without him.",2015
2,"This is the worst among all the reality TV ghost hunting shows. First of all it is not scientific in any manner. They do not practice objectivity in investigations. They always come into a place, accepting as fact whatever hearsay of paranormal activity is reported. They come in with their conclusions and just are searching for such experiences. One example is the investigation in Bobby Mackee's place. The leader keeps on speaking of the well as being a portal of hell where demonic spirits use to come in. 1. What is his basis that the well is the portal? 2. What is his basis that, if it is a portal, that it is to hell? 3. What is his basis to say that the spirits are demonic? 4. Even more basic than that, what is his basis to say there are spirits? - Totally, unscientific sensationalism. If they were there to investigate, then one begins with questions and not conclusions. Furthermore, there is this part where he whips out the EMF meter to measure spirit activity in the bathroom area. He didn't even take a baseline reading to start with to find out if the area is inherently high with EMF. Also, in the same episode, they point out to body hair standing as signs of the presence of spirits. What is the basis for such a statement? Extremely irresponsible to neglect the more obvious physiological causes of one's skin hair standing. in other words, these people believe any story they hear, take it as fact, then enter into a location trying to find anything to justify the story. The conclusion begins before the investigation.",2010
10,"Ghost Adventures – what can I say? I watch TV for entertainment and not for reality. Why should Ghost Adventures be any different than any other show? For this reason there is no reason to give this show a bad grade. Do I believe any of the stories – no! Do I get a good laugh - yes! The job these guys have is so cool and they get paid for it. I envy what they do and truly enjoy watching them eat every little scrap of haunting up - like a four year-older eating candy on Halloween – pardon the scary referenceyikes! They need to adopt a motto like, 'My ""I Believe Button"" is Always Pushed – No Skepticism Aloud.' When these shows bring in E.M.I. (Electromagnetic Interference) sensing devices I often wonder what part of the E.M. spectrum they are looking at. Where in the frequency spectrum are these ghosties hiding? To get a more accurate reading - I would suggest a hand-held spectrum analyzer with a small directional antenna, instead of some cheap plastic box with flashing lights. Lend some credibility to the show - please. This would also give 'researcher' Zak more chances to use key lines like: 'What in the hell was that?', or 'Stop running!' or 'Did you hear that?' This kind of information would help with in new phrase development...no longer would you hear over and over, 'DISEMBODIED VOICE'. They could incorporate 'disembodied squiggly line on spectrum analyzer.' What the heck - sounds official to me. Anywaysmy skepticism drags me into the realm of negativity and I refuse to wander down that dark and stormy path. This is a very enjoyable program with a whole lot of fun stuff going on. Zak and his team are a true 'hoot'. Next time the show is on, pop some popcorn, turn off all the lights and get ready for the ride of your life. You may never get scared, but it is so funny and entertaining watching each of these characters scare each-other – you may end up spilling your popcorn. Keep up the good work and I enjoy every minute. I have decided to come back and haunt something...my master plan",2011
4,"The title sums it all up: Three guys go on to experience ghost adventures. That said, let's talk about their methods. They get locked into a haunted site, set their cameras up in places where they expect something to happen and then roam the building for the rest of the night. More often than not they actually catch something. Most of the time it's ""voices"" that they categorize ""unexplained"". Sometimes they're lucky and catch some video, too. Their methods don't seem to be too professional. Especially the main guy annoys me a lot, because he's always screaming around. You would think that a ghost also hears you when you speak in a normal voice. Most of their findings are ""weird feelings"" which have no scientific reason at all, if you ask me. They always show you wishy-washy footage and claim it's paranormal, when in reality you hardly see anything. Well, I only watch this show because I guess they have to be lucky sometime and catch something that can be taken as real proof. But really, after all is said and done, this is just 45min of some guys running around with a camera and yelling and feeling very important.",2008
1,"Well, I'll admit it, I fell for it the first 2 episodes and was thrilled over this show. I thought Zak was okay I didn't mind him but did think that he was over re-acting to things, only to find out on the third episode (the asylum) that he was over acting not re-acting and was a bit bummed out. However, all is not lost, this show is still entertaining and a bit scary even though it's fake. I realized after that so called hand try to grab him (lol) that this was NOT real and that what they found at the Sloss Boiler was in fact faked and was disappointed. I really like the cast, Aaron and Nick are cool guys and if Zak takes it down a notch with the over acting then he's not bad to watch either.",2008

It's funny and they don't waste time showing you them review the evidence or talk about their social problems. Another thing I love about this is that they show you the evidence as it happens. They have way cooler devices like the spirit box (something that ghosts can use to say things). Whenever I watch the intro, I can't help but smile at how goofy it is. Although the intro isn't trying to be funny, the show has a sense of humor. Them messing around and making Aaron go to the scariest place by himself every episode really makes it. All and all, it's a really great show that any ghost enthusiast can appreciate (and one of my favorites!).",2011

9,"I was almost giving up seeing this film because of certain reviews which were not that good. To my amazement , the film turned up to be not good, but excellent. It shows people fighting for their lives, starving, getting to the point where many people loose faith and come close to being like animals. That is when you need a good leader which the Bielski brothers certainly were. And what good actors, Live Schreiber as Zus , what a performance, also Daniel Craig faultless as Tuvia. When you see all that killing, done by men (and women) trying to survive and also in some cases, revenge, you wonder how peaceful, good persons can change and become violent, when circumstances demand. And pray that those times will never happen to us. Spare us from being the Chosen People, says the Rabbi, overcome by anguish in a touching scene. But it is through suffering and faith that these people defy their destiny. My mother and father left Bielorus before the war. But most of their close ones did not.",2009

It is completely set in the woods which it does some claustrophobic . Splendid acting by all-star-cast . Nicely photographed by Eduardo Serra in colorful palette . Emotive and sensitive musical score by the great composer James Newton Howard. This is a true story , worth telling and stunningly directed in old-style by Edward Zwick .",2010
8,"The movie was good. Not Zwick's best effort though and as for the acting it was Liev Schreiber that delivered the most. Every time I see Craig I see James Bond and that other guy, Jamie Bell, was barely even on screen. I'm guessing most of his scenes were cut out of the film to pave the way for more Craig screen time. The action set pieces were mostly impressive but the problem is, its over before you know it. But I can honestly say, it was impressive nonetheless. Its not brainless by any means, the movie has a profound and compelling story. One can only wonder how these filmmakers come up with more WWII movie ideas every year.",2009

Director Edward Zwick (Glory, The Last Samurai, Blood Diamond) once again returns to what he knows best by dealing with a group of underdogs, outnumbered but putting up a fight. DEFIANCE also proves that the blond James Bond, Daniel Craig, indeed has so much more to offer as an actor. This is the story of The Fighting Jews.",2008

I was dying to see Defiance because i'm a huge Jamie Bell fan, and the story seemed really interesting, but i was kind of worried cause Daniel Craig is not exactly one of my favorite actors, but he really impressed me. I think this is his best movie yet. And it's not just the acting, but i think the way they told this story is very efficient, and the sets were incredible. I think they truly stuck to the story of what really happened back then, and believe me, you will not be disappointed with this movie. Jamie Bell was wonderful as Asael (as usual), Liev Schreiber was great, and Daniel Craig was just as great. In my opinion, this movie is a must-see.",2008
4,"I have never written a review on The IMDb, but this movie has prompted me to write a review. Its pointless to go over where and how I saw this movie. It is sufficient to say that I saw it with high hopes. In my eyes, it was a huge failure and waste of time. There are few redeeming qualities in this film. The costumes look great, and there is an appropriate mixture of Russian and German weapons mixed into the camp as one would expect in a camp like this. The brothers power struggle is believable and compelling. There is a lot lacking however. I spent the whole film hoping and trying to find any signs of an enjoyable film. There were regrettably not many. The stereotypes of Russians, Germans, and Jews abound and detract from the plot which is never able to engage the viewer. The way the story is presented leaves the viewer no reason to be compelled, and the cliché moments in the film, that try to draw emotion, never achieve their purpose. The end of the movie is far too predictable and embarrassing. James Bond makes an appearance as savior of the Jews as he runs around killing a whole German tank division with their own gun, and being saved by his brother right when all seems lost. This movie is ridiculous, and I feel let down as I was hoping for something great the whole time I watched, but only got to see this poorly made and clichéd film.",2009

How can a the movie crew make a mistake like that? Oh, you don't know what was so horrible with that? When the WWII ended the Russians was running Poland and they were worse tyrants than the Germans ever were. Polish people doesn't like Russians at all.

6,"No doubt that ""Defiance"" is a very inspiring movie. Set during the winter of 1941-42, just after Nazi Germany has attacked the Soviet Union, the movie follows the exploits of the 3 Bielski brothers, who watched their father be murdered by German troops and escape into the forest, only to end up becoming a rallying point and leaders for other displaced Jews. The movie portrays rivalries among the brothers themselves, rivalries within the group of Jews they're leading, difficulties in dealing with the Soviet troops, who should be their allies, as well as the hardships of dealing with hunger, cold and illness. Ultimately it leads to a pretty good climactic fight against Nazi troops. Yet, for all that I can't say it's great.",2009

They were Belarussian Jews who were forced to hide out in the forests because Germans destroyed their village and massacred their families. There they end up leading more than a thousand other Jewish survivors to freedom. Their flight inevitably drew parallelisms to no less than the book of Exodus.",2009
5,"Defiance (2008) tells the story of the Bielski brothers who constructed a community of their own in the Belarussian forests during the Second World War and fought against Nazi Germans in the process. The film is based on a true story which I'm not very familiar with but I'm sure the Hollywood studios have had their hand in the mix because the finished story here has a very overly ""heroic"" theme in it and the story feels very one-sided and ""simplified for the masses"". There's multiple scenes which try to show different sides to the story and the events at hand and try to throw some shades of gray into the otherwise black and white way of seeing the world but all those scenes suffer from a heavy underlining and they only scratch the surface of the issues that should have been explored more deeply - like the tension between the campers, the nature of the Nazi soldiers, the nature of the Jews etc. This all ends up to the fact that the story told here is a very shallow one and feels through-out very ""Hollywood-ish"".",2009

These Jews were collaborated with NKWD, and they committed crimes against local Polish population.

10,"I read all the bad reviews, and watched all the episodes. Trust me, the people giving it bad reviews watched only the pilot or two episodes and gave up too quickly. The show evolves and gets much better than the first few episodes. The plots are exciting, much more than Fringe (which can be disgusting and predictable) or even Dollhouse (which can be too unrealistic), two shows that I also really like this season.",2009
9,"Despite what some others have said, the series with the too-long name DOESN'T ""crap all over the movies"" it was spun off from. It actually *builds* upon what has come before and expands the universe that was set up in the first two films (having the good sense to pretend as if the dismal T3 never happened). No, it's not quite like the movies, but that's a *good* thing (since this IS a series, and thus it requires story arcs that can play out over the course of a whole season).",2008
9,"First of all I would like to begin by stating that I actually enjoyed Terminator 3. I know that there are a lot of haters out there but I do not count myself as one of them. I enjoyed the movie for what it was. However, as a die-hard Terminator fan I believe ""enjoyable"" is an underachievement for a franchise as great as the Terminator series. Terminators 1 and 2 were classics, and the third instalment fell a little short.",2007
10,"This show is brilliant. The writers and cast have all done an amazing job in creating their view of the Terminator series. It is like an on going 5/5 star movie. Amazing effects, plot and actors!!! It contains all the elements of great entertainment- action, romance, drama, psychological insight and a bit of comedy even!! If you want to start watching it now, I recommend to buy the first season and watch it all and the previous episodes of season 2 because this show is deep and has much character background and development to truly understand and love it. ",2009
10,This show is the best story advancement of the Terminator franchise since Cameron's Terminator 2 in terms of quality and plot development.,2012
8,This show has taken some weird turns but overall is still one of the better sci-fi shows on prime time. When I heard this show was danger of being canceled I almost flipped. They are going to far with the canceling. Just because a show doesn't rate in the ever changing top 5 doesn't mean it's not a hit with the fans. I do enjoy Camerons strange terminator antics and John I-am-tired-of-trying-to-be-a-future-hero attitude. Sarah holds this all together with her stubbornness and relentless pursuit of trying to stop judgment day. Now it does get a little to unbelievable with Sarah's flashbacks and delusions of Kyle. Also the fact that there is a little bit of sexual attraction implied at John with Cameron is strange. But none the less a great show.,2009
9,I had a chance to catch this pilot yesterday and being a die-hard T2 fan i was very impressed.,2007
10,"An absolute gem of a show, I cant run down any, not one of the actors and their characters, the show had me from the first. The plot twists are way beyond the movies, and in my opinion, make it even better than them. The emotions are shown even when they are trying to be super tough and hold it in, Humans being Humans. The twist with weaver being a cyborg who is AGAINST skynet is great, (although I'm guessing she has (had) her own plans for the human race) All I can think of about the cancellation is, The people who make these decisions must live in a tiny little bubble of their own and not interact with us mere mortals, they haven't got a scooby about what is decent and whats not. Their absurd idea that its good to show half a series and then break for close to 6 months, then return expecting to pick up the fans where they left off is an example of their idiocy. This show, flashforward, Battlestar Galactica, even Farscape all had fans watching avidly and a lot more that could be done with them, yet the looneys are in charge so we are ignored all the time. I have visions of ""V"" and Caprica and perhaps even Stargate Universe being cut off at their peak. Maybe they are trying to convert us to sugar coated day time telly addicts. NEVER GONNA HAPPEN",2010
8,"You know when you sit down and watch something new, and it grabs you, surprises you and entertains you? Well it doesn't happen all the time, but this show did that with me.",2007
10,"Let me just get this out of the way before I start praising the series. No, this series is NOT perfect and there are definitely certain elements that could have been done better... that said, it still definitely falls into my top 10 favorite series of all time.... somewhere in the mix. ",2013
4,"I usually don't write reviews online, but Terminator is one of my favorite franchises out there and this series not being as good as it could have been, irks me enough to write one.",2009
5,"First let me say this. I enjoy Terminator and didn't hate the pilot episode. I don't worship it, but I enjoy it as much as most fans. When I heard that Terminator was coming to television as a weekly series I was instantly curious of the storyline and quality as the movies and mythos are such that a series is a very tall order. Well if I had to phrase things then I'd say that the pilot, while good, fell several inches short of being tall.",2008
6,"First, I admit I've seen only the first hour of this show. I was prepared to completely hate it. It turns out that it wasn't so bad. The mother character is okay. Not as tough as the Sarah in the movies. Not as smart either.",2008
6,"I sat through every single episode of this now canceled series. Although well outside the targeted 18-49 year old graphic, I've been a sci-fi and Terminator movie fan for decades. This show thrilled on several levels but disappointed on many, many more. In the end, I found it simply depressing.",2009
10,"When Terminator 3 came out, it was good. Lots of people enjoyed it. I watched season one of TSSC and was blown away. Thomas Dekker's portrayal of John Conner is spot on, Brian Austin Green, is actually great. Summer Glau is a great replacement for Arny, Lena Headey does a great job.",2008
7,With a series as epic as Terminator it will be hard for the TV-series to live up to the standard set by the first two movies. That said it does a good job.,2008
10,"For those who saw the original pilot, leaked quite some time ago, you may have experienced a level of disappointment in terms of the quality of the show. I thought the pilot was uninspired, but at least entertaining. I supported the show and looked forward to it mostly out of loyalty to Firefly alum Summer Glau, who was excellent even in the pilot. The writing was poor with numerous logic errors, silly lines, and a simple rehashed plot taken directly from T2, but with less special effects. I admittedly did not have high hopes for a long running Terminator series.",2008
5,"I was very excited to discover that the SCC's were coming to New Zealand television. Having been a big fan of T1/T2 and even T3 I thought this show couldn't possibly fail, so I went to a friend's house and watched the entire season in 1 day. After watching the pilot I was worried, but sometimes pilots are bad so I gave it a chance. It got worse. Things went downhill fast, plots began to make little sense, acting appeared paper thin and scripting looked like they had been done by someone who writes as bad as me.",2008
1,"This series is nothing whatsoever like the excellent first two Terminator movies The third was an abomination, and one thing this show does *right* is to pretend that abomination does not exist. The problem is, just like the third movie, this TV series *also* should not exist since it cannot come anywhere close to matching the first two movies on any level whatsoever.",2008
1,"As a Terminator based story this series is complete nonsense. Seems like the writers haven't seen any of the three Terminator films, all important and less important things have been thrown to trash and trend killers came up with fancy new ones. Few things that really bother me are: 1. Time traveling, I mean WTF? now it's possible to jump around in time like it's nothing, original terminator films make it clear that it's irreversible when you travel. And that metal-head that just flew through that ""portal"" that's not supposed to happen, nothing dead can pass through that. Terminator 3 movie's incidents have been passed.",2008
10,"I have always been a big fan of the films and was delighted to hear about the TV adaptation, I thought if it was done well it would be great but I didn't expect (or hope) it would be this good.",2008
3,"(My post contains spoilers! Do Not Read if you have not seen the entire season!) It's obvious within the first 15 minutes of the pilot of this show who the real star is  not the whiny brat Thomas Dekker who half-heartedly plays the revolutionary hero who is supposed to save the world and certainly not the usually talented Lena Headey who plays an illogical soccer mom who wants to be tough but just can't quite pull it off. The star of this show is clearly Summer Glau, who plays Cameron, the female Terminator. Summer amazed us in Firefly, as the mentally-disturbed and highly intelligent reader, River. And here she takes her talent one step further, becoming a machine who actually wants to convey human emotion on some level. She is superb! The guest stars this show managed to snag also increased the show's potential in my mind: Brian Austin Green (I'm a biased 90210 fan, but he was terrific in this role) and Garret Dillahut (amazing in Deadwood and Life). These two actors and Summer ""bring it"" where the others fall short. This show had a lot of potential, but I find myself struggling to watch it  and I certainly don't give it any mindshare. (I learned this the hard way with Lost.) I watch it to support Summer Glau, the Firefly Alum (same reason I watch Chuck, for Adam Baldwin), and because I also REALLY WANT Garret Dillahut to become the next leading actor in Hollywood. (He was so good in Deadwood, he played two different characters.) Dialogue was trite, and Sarah Connor's monologues in the beginning of each episode set the tone that this was show was also ignoring the hard-willed and inspirational Sarah Connor that Linda Hamilton depicted. If I wanted to watch a soccer mom and her whiny teen, I'll just visit my neighborhood Target store, thank you. Part of me cheered when Summer Glau blew up at the end of the season finale. Thank God, I thought, I don't really have to watch this show anymore. Bottom line: There was potential for a great show and it just missed the mark. Some of the actors did the best they could with the script (and did a fantastic job working with such an inconsistent, rambling plot) and other actors just became whiny alter-egos of the characters they were SUPPOSED to be. If you're a fan of the Terminator series, it might be a let down. If you're a Summer Glau fan, you'll be amazed once again  but her outstanding performance may not be enough to keep you tuning in. No matter what, I definitely wouldn't waste money on buying the season. Let's see if the second season could be any worse.",2008
10,"Rambo (2008) is essential best action film in the action genre my second personal favorite film in the Rambo franchise. I love this film to death! Rambo is a fighting machine and I absolutely love the gory action films. This is movie is great it is absolutely awesome I love this film to death. It is the best film, since Rambo III wasn't that successful, this movie was. It is been nearly a 10 year anniversary since this movie come out. Here is where the legend of action heroes reloaded and ended well. ",2018
7,"I saw this at an advance screening in Oslo, and going in, I didn't expect it to be any more than a cheesy and somewhat gory tribute to eighties actioners by a star/director/producer/writer who was desperate to relive past glory. That latter may or may not be true, but my former assessment was plain wrong. This movie is authentic, shocking and unlike any other comparable movie.",2008
10,"First of all, let me start by saying John Rambo is a masterpiece. They don't make them like this anymore. It is a return of the classic action movie of the 80's and 90's but with a touch of modern directing. Some will say it is gory, some will says it has no plot. But let's be honest, nobody wants a dramatic twist or a deeper meaning when they go to see Rambo! And even if you want to, you can still find it in traces. John Rambo is a killing machine but he is also a guy with strong moral values so if you are really looking for a message it is there to be seen. Other than that it is a full blooded action movie that will strap you to your seat for whole 95 minutes!",2008
9,"Rambo is without question a sick action movie and Stallone has proved himself again as an intense actor and as a solid director. This installment combines elements from all three previous movies but this one had a much more realistic feel. Yes some dialog is questionable and there are a few, albeit brief, scenes that don't quite work, but make no mistake, this movie takes no prisoners. Stallone slips back into the role with ease and his supporting players do an admirable job. Critics will whine as they always do about the excessive violence, gore and lack of story. (Stick to giving awful movies like The Skeleton Key thumbs up guys). The ironic thing is that Rambo actually gives a vivid and some would say accurate portrayal of war. It has a similar feel to Black Hawk Down and borrows its chaotic action. Rambo pulls no punches...It's brutality, violence and gore are rooted in reality. Gone is the ""fun"" action of 2 and 3. It is replaced with realism which amounts to some of the best and most intense action sequences I've ever seen. My only real gripe with the film was scenes that were sped up in post. (No big deal) ",2008
9,"A straight action film only Stallone could deliver. Nobody else could direct such an uncompromising pursuit of battle. The battle sequences of this movie are glorious and violent in a way that is special, a new extreme level of tension was achieved in my opinion and I don't say this in blind excitement.",2008
9,"Just watch it, words don't justify it! People didn't believe Sly still had it, but they were so wrong. After the the great performance at Rocky Balboa I expected another great performance for him. But this was even better than I imagined. You don't have to be an Stallone fan to enjoy this movie. If you like action movies, this one is for you. A word of caution though, this isn't for the light hearted, there are some serious violence in this movie. I am gonna say this is one of the best action movies I have seen in a long time. But you don't have to take my word for it, just watch it. It's better than the previous Rambo films. Expcept for about 15 minutes in the middle, the whole film is action packed. You can't possibly be bored. If you hate action movie or if you have something against violence, this isn't for you. But if you are not, than sit back and enjoy the legend that is Rambo for one last time.",2008
10,"During his career, Sylvester Stallone gave the audience many great times to remember him.From Rocky and Rambo, to Demolition Man and Shade, Stallone was always a true super star. As an almost exclusive action films actor, he brought to the audience for over three decades, high quality action movies. However, aging is always a problem for such actors and Stallone could escape it....a little though! His physical condition is tremendous! Let's not forget that he is almost 62. It is a fact that his last films did not manage to reach the quality of his previous successes. Driven, D-Tox, Avenging Angelo and Shade, were really good films indeed but their shine was not as big as Rocky or Rambo. That is why Stallone returned with his major two success roles. Rocky Balboa was excellent and meaningfull. Now it is time for...John Rambo! This film is simply excellent. Although it is mostly an action movie it has also deeper meanings such as ethical values and political messages. Just like Rocky Balboa, John Rambo uses the formula of the first movie mixed with this of the forth!Monosylabic dialogues from Rambo meet the political messages of the activists, The violent reaction of Rambo towards the brutal soldiers is justified by his ethical code with a deeper meaning that oppresion and injustice generates strong reaction! Acting as a whole, is very good and convincing. Stallone is really born to be Rambo and the supporting cast is made by young actors who meet the quality standards of Milo Ventimiglia. The project budget is 50m so as you understand there are many real-like explosions and effects. What is new is the ultra violent death scenes. They really look true!The story is interesting although ,as you expect, not complicated. To summarize, John Rambo is one of the best action movies that 2008 will probably bring to us.Also it is a must to see because not only it is a really good movie but also because it is the last Rambo film. Stallone even if he is 62, looks no more than 45 and his condition is impressive. A must for all action film fans and not only by them, Rambo is a really good film and you should not miss it.",2008
10,"OH the Haustacity. Yes...I will say it again, HAUSTASTIC!!!! Rambo at his best...I don't care, he may be old, but crap man. This movie is awesome.",2008
10,Rambo is a great action movie and reminds me on how the action movies were made in 80's. The plot is developing very fast and the pacing is very good. Sly is doing all his stunts and doesn't speak much. Mercenaries were good in my opinion and without them the movie would be to unbelievable and unrealistic.,2008
10,"Being a huge Sylvester Stallone fan, I was more than happy just seeing him on screen again, and I would usually just be content watching any movie with Stallone, and that's what I went in expecting. But hell, was I wrong, this had me jumping up from my seat every 2 minutes. This had one hell of a message, and wasn't just a mindless action movie with gore. I loved each bit of the movie, and watching Stallone act so well was a total pleasure. It was also kind of shocking at how Stallone is still in physical form, considering his age. He was very flexible for his age, and that's also what helped push the movie further. Also, his ruthlessness in regards to the injustice. Overall, a brilliant 10/10 if you ask me.",2008
7,"Thrilling and moving Rambo episode in which he returns to war and to rescue American prisoners . The famous trilogy has been completed by this recent ¨ John Rambo¨ , a definitive improvement and directed by the same Stallone in which Rambo fights enemies in Thailand ; nevertheless the best considered is the original . Violent movie with Rambo character who started in ¨First Blood¨ and that launched Stallone career going on his successful Rambo episodes . Sylvester Stallone as brawny hero Rambo is top-notch , he was a previous Green Beret , now retired and living a pacific existence in Thailand . He has retreated to a easy life in a rural Thai village next the Burmese frontier , capturing snakes for local entertainers, and transporting visitors in his old 109 PT boat . But John Rambo joins a group of mercenaries (Graham McTavish, Matthew Mardsen) to venture into war-torn Burma, and rescue a group of Christian aid workers (Julie Benz,Paul Schulze) who were abducted by the ruthless local infantry who carries out a brutal massacre . He then frees the prisoners but cruel soldiers sett off in pursuit and Rambo leads his pursuers into all kinds of booby snares , puts dangerous traps in the jungle woods and mountains . Rambo appears threatening , lurking and harassing to his enemies pursuers escaping the innumerable risks and dangers .",2011

10,I was one of the big fan of RAMBO series all time. I have been always loving all series but this one shocked me up lots.,2008
9,"Rated R for strong graphic bloody violence, sexual assaults, grisly images and language.",2008
8,"Action: 10 / 10 on action! It takes a few moments to develop, but then the action kicks off, and when it does, it just builds and builds until the climax. There's plenty of blood and gore as Rambo, sporting his trademark 50 caliber, blazes away. In fact, it's one of the few movies to shows how grizzly such an attack would be.",2008
6,"A 60 year old Stallone as an ex-soldier who can still kick ass is more believable than him as a 60 year old boxer--it's one of the things that worked about this...ahem..film. I felt the same way after watching the last Rocky movie as I did after watching this. It was good, but ultimately pointless; you know that the peace-corp types will be wrong, and violence will be the only solution, and it will result in a major bloodbath (seriously the most violent of the series). Rambo has no surprises. That said, Rambo is enormously entertaining, violent as hell, and you get what you came for. It will definitely satisfy fans of the series, though I had a weird feeling when I left the theater: did I really just pay to see Rambo? Wow...",2008
10,"On Monday Oct. 25th, 1982 I enlisted in the United States Army. The weekend before, my last movie as a civilian was First Blood. I have to say that movie was a major source of motivation. As Rambo is being chased up the mountain he says to himself ""keep moving"" I repeated that mantra through Boot, Airborne, and then Q-course(you could go SF of the street back then). I spent the next 25 years serving proudly with the brave men of the 5th SFG at Campbell(RIP Matty Kimmell). A few months ago I separated (honorably) and made my way to H-wood to keep an eye on my actress daughter. I refused to see any movies until Rambo came out today, first film as a civilian. It was well worth the wait. This is a great closer to an important figure in American pop culture. I found the acting and script to be first rate. The action was TOO realistic, I had tears in my eyes as the Burmy soldier bayonets the young boy and as the team comes across the overrun village with the rotting corpses, very realistic. The only issues I had were of the merc team, multi-national teams don't exist and the interesting calibers they carried, but hey the spirit remains. Ending Rambo were it was first headed to, so many years ago was poetry. Perhaps my own history shades my view of this top rate movie, but isn't that what films are for, to show you that no matter what you are things DO change.",2008
8,"Despite the fact that I grew up with Sly films, I'm not a huge Rambo fan. But no one can deny the character's place as the iconic action hero. I admit that when I heard Stallone was reviving Rambo (as well as Rocky), I was more than skeptical. But both films were dutifully faithful to their respective franchises and profess now that I was wrong about Stallone - he has garnered my full respect as a quality director and film maker, at least within the confines of his own beloved franchises.",2008
8,"Take the first 20 minutes of ""Saving Private Ryan"" - with soldiers limbs being shot off at the D-Day landing at Omaha Beach, add some magnificent jungle scenery and action a la ""Tears Of The Sun, and put it all in "" Blackhawk Down"" mode with gunfire dominating the film....and you have the latest Rambo movie.",2008
5,"Am amazed by the ""yee ha"" themes which are constantly coming across in the reviews/comments on this film. To be frank it's gun (and knife, and mine, and bow and arrow, and flamethrower....) porn all the way. Now that's fine but attempting to dress it up as deep and meaningful is hugely disingenuous. In my opinion the whole Burma message and the massive over inflating of just how mean and nasty the villains really are combine solely to give some sort of justification for the incessant violence.",2008
9,"I have to say, this exceeded any expectations I had for a Rambo film. This is no sad comeback farce, this is the real deal. Sylvester Stallone plays to his strengths, using his age (and mileage) to his advantage as a haunted old bulwark. There's no oiled-up posturing or sad old man-boobs on display. The drama's quick and to the point. Rambo maybe speaks 50 words throughout.",2008
9,"First Blood and Rambo are two of the best action films ever made and even Rambo III is good. Stallone's interpretation of Rambo is that of a reluctant hero. He really never wanted to be in the situation he was thrust into, but once there, he cannot deny who that man is, and that is none other than a killing machine. In the commentary for First Blood, by Stallone himself, he admits that Rambo is a man that can't help who he is. He doesn't start wars or confrontations, but he sure as hell excels in the situation. This RAMBO is no different. Just as Rocky told Adrian in Rocky IV you can't change who you are. Rambo is no different. He wants to live peacefully, and for 20 years he might have been, but that time has passed. Burma/Myanmar is about to learn that.",2008
10,"Do you want to know how good ""Rambo"" is? Well, if it had been released in 2007, I would have had it ranked just outside my Top 10. It is somewhat embarrassing to admit that -- after all, the franchise had become a joke after the 1985 and 1988 sequels. Those two efforts had completely undermined and overshadowed the brilliance of the original, ""First Blood"".",2008
10,"I remember the first time that I saw First Blood, I thought it was going to be a typical silly action movie, but it turned into one of the best action movies I had seen. I remember hearing about the Rambo sequel which was at the time titled ""John Rambo"" with ""Rocky Balboa"", I saw Rocky and was very disappointed, so I was assuming the same was going to be with Rambo. But after some promising reviews, I went ahead and saw it today and this is seriously the best action movie in years. I couldn't believe how incredible this movie was, it was brutal, terrifying, but had a great story. Sylvester Stallone still has it, and is incredible, I can't believe how great he looked and how he still hasn't lost his edge. The reason why this movie worked is because I think he really understands John Rambo, this movie could have never worked without his touch.",2008
7,"Being lucky, I already saw ""Yes Man"" and was pleasantly surprised. Jim Carrey is not really my all time favorite (despite his comic talent and acting skills), but in this movie he seems to have hit the spot.",2008
8,"Yes Man follows the same basic genre comedy structure that we've seen an endless amount of times in the past few years. The main character has a big problem, they work to solve that problem, the problem is solved and happy times are had. Then another problem arises as a result to the solution to the original problem. So everyone is sad. But then that problem is solved and everyone lives happily ever after. And there's a message about how to live your life sprinkled in there. For every single comedy in the past few years with that structure, I've gotten so bored by the time it's over because I just lose interest when the drama comes in during the third act. I either don't care about the characters or I don't care about the message.",2008
10,"I went to this film as one of those process-of-elimination things: Valkry had Tom Cruise, my friend had already seen Benjamin Button, Spirit's show-times suck, my local theater is idiotic and not showing Doubt or Slumdog Millionaire, all leaving Yes Man which neither of us were enthused about, but hey! it got us out of the house. We were shocked to leave the theater with our lungs hurting. The movie was well thought, well executed, and the humor was smart, snappy, and so far from the usual toilet humor of Jim Carrey. I was throughly and delightfully surprised with this film. On the note of message: I think this film actually has a very valuable message. Never in the history of humankind has the average person had so many opportunities to live life in ways never before imagined, yet never before have we been so isolated. Our computers; our phones; our mp3s and ipods; dare I say it, our movies all keep us isolated from actual social interaction. We are skeptical and judgmental about those who actually seek social interaction and friendship (site: Norman) that we fail to realize we are the ones who are actually lame--we are the ones not gathering with the people we love and those we have yet to meet. We are the ones spending our nights lulled into lame predictability, sitting in front of our TVs, telling characters in films to ""just snap it off already."" Yes Man is not just a fun filled film. It is a well deserved social critique.",2008
7,"I always get excited about a new Jim Carrey movie. In my opinion, he has rarely done anything unwatchable in whatever genre from The Mask to Liar Liar via Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind. Yes Man is an excellent feel-good comedy with an outstanding turn from Jim Carrey, Zooey Deschanel & Terence Stamp. The movie is unfortunately predictable (like most Jim Carey flicks) but very enjoyable with a hard-to-ignore message about how people should live their lives. Don't be surprised after seeing the film to start saying yes a bit more often and how much of a difference it may have on your daily life. Yes Man is a worthy addition to Jim Carrey's filmography.",2008
6,"Yes Man was a delight to watch. Critics had panned it a bit, but unfairly, in my view. Granted, it is formulaic, but it IS a rom-com, and rom-coms have formulas. What made this film so great was the natural charm of Zooey Deschanel. She is beautiful, of course, but not in a ""model-y"" kind of way. She has always had a freshness and honesty about her that makes her appealing. When I first saw her in ""Almost Famous,"" playing the older sister, I wished I had an older sister like that. When she played the girl lead in Big Trouble, she was quirky, but without any of the self-aware conceit that can often accompany quirky young female actors. I will be kind and avoid names, but perhaps you can picture in your mind some of the ""Tragically Hip"" and oh-so-cool young actresses who do quirk with a smirk. Zooey Deschanel has an innocence and a friendly quality that really make her shine, in the way a flower shines.",2008
8,"After commercial failures like Lemony Snicket, Fun with Dick and Jane and The Number 23 Jim Carrey could use another hit. Yes Man might just do the trick. It will undoubtedly not only mark Carrey's return to box office greatness (a 45 million dollar opening (when there are no snowstorms around)?), it will also go into history as the first movie in which the Canadian born actor gets oral sex on screen. No kidding. But more on that later.",2008
9,"""Yes Man"" is surprisingly good, and here the punch line is everything. Jim Carrey is great in Director Peyton Reed's hysterical romantic comedy. Zooey Deschanel is amazingly charming and quirky. In ""Yes Man"" Carrey plays Carl, who has been divorced for 3 years from Stephanie (flighty and hot Molly Sims) and has an uninspired job as a loan officer at Brea Savings in Los Angeles. Carl has pretty much checked out in life. To that end he says ""No"" to all invites. Carl even forgets to attend his best friend Peter's (funny Bradley Cooper) engagement party. An old buddy invites Carl to a seminar given by Tony Robbins-like self help guru Terrence Bundley (charismatic Terrence Stamp). Terrence invites Carl to accept the ""covenant"" to say ""Yes"" to everything in life. Reluctantly, Carl accepts.",2009
9,"Being a teenager in the 1990's, I have to say I was never a big fan of Jim Carrey's mainstream performances in the movies that made him the star that he is today. Hits like Ace Ventura, Dumb & Dumber and Liar Liar left me mostly indifferent to Carrey's rather obscene personality. It was only when he shined in more complex roles like The Truman Show, Man on the Moon and eventually Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind that I grew to respect the wide range of characters Carrey is able to bring to life.",2008
7,"After seeing ""The Number 23"" I was beginning to wonder if Jim Carrey had renounced his trademark physical comedy roles he played to such great effect in ""Bruce Almighty"", ""Liar, Liar"", ""Dumb & Dumber"", etc.",2008
7,"I saw this movie as a early showing and having gotten the tickets for free I said ""what the heck, I'll see anything for free"". So right off the bat I went in with low expectations. The previews made it look like the same old Jim Carrey Schtick. However, I was pleasantly surprised. ",2008
10,"Despite the fact that I am a huge fan of Carrey, I admit a lot of his comedic performances are somewhat ridiculous. But this is legitimately a sensible comedy where he doesn't use a lot of his ""Rubberface"" antics and actually just acts funny. The premise of this film is intriguing and I loved watching it. Both Jim and Zooey are excellent the story is amazing. All the Carrey-haters should give this one a chance, it really deserves it. I think Jim's most recent movies have been great. It's his older movies that people hate him for. But he's becoming a legit dramatic actor who can also be funny. He sometimes goes over the top, but all-in-all he is a multi-faceted professional. This movie deserves a lot of praise because it is excellent. This brings back flashes of his performance in the extremely popular ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"". In closing, give ""Yes Man"" a chance. It's good for some laughs but also offers a very optimistic view on life in general.",2008
10,"First of all I would like to say that this movie might seem like Liar Liar at first sight, but it is not!",2008
10,"I saw a free screening of this hilarious movie in my hometown and it was MAGNIFICENT!!! It starts off fast and never slows down (never a dull moment in the movie) and for fans of Jim Carrey (like me) who wants him to be himself, prepare to laugh so extremely hard that will have your sides in excruciating pain from all the laughter you made!! Jim Carrey was at his very best & he made me laugh non-stop till' the end of the movie but it was not a one-man show, the supporting cast threw in some fantastic delivery lines, humor & craziness. Zooey Deschanel was surprisingly very funny (didn't know she could be THIS funny), Bradley Cooper was funny, Terence Stamp did great as well but out of all of the supporting cast, there are two of them that had some of the funniest scenes in movie history: Rhys Darby plays the memorable and hilarious boss of Carl Allen (Carrey), he had some classic and unbelievable delivery lines in the movie that were just funny. And the other person: Fionnula Flanaghan who plays the nasty, sexually & very funny neighbor of Carl Allen and delivers us one of the most disgusting & very funny scenes in years (not giving you spoilers)!! Yes Man is not only a very, very funny but it sends a good message about how do you want to handle your life.",2008
7,"Meet Carl. Carl leads a life on his own. Somewhat miserable because he's always stuck with himself. Carl denies himself all the pleasures of life because he's unable to accept them. With each and every new opportunity arising he turns it down with a firm NO. Luckily for Carl he has a friend, a friend that pulls him along to a seminar where Carl is introduced to the power of Yes. Converted by the power of Yes Carl is now ready to accept life's challenges and chances, saying Yes to every single one of them.",2009
6,"Jim Carrey, a man who has delivered some of the most memorable comedies of the 90's: Ace Ventura, Liar Liar, Dumb and Dumber, and the Mask. He used to be one of the funniest men alive, now it's just kind of odd, he's gone into the drama genre in films, which is good, he's actually proved to be a good actor. But with the comedy, it's like he was once the person who you would be first to invite to the party because he was so funny, now he's the guy who invites himself to the party and laughs at his own jokes. I think because he's older it's just awkward watching him trying so hard to make people laugh. Not that Yes Man is a bad film, it's just a different version of Liar Liar, yet he's not even hypnotized into saying yes to everything, he just does so because he thinks it'll make his life better. So instead of feeling bad for him you just go ""ummm, are you an idiot?"". I don't wanna know if a man hit on him if he had to say yes to that too.",2009
10,"Overall, this movie is wonderful. But it could be bad, too. It depends on how you look at it. If you look at it as a comedy, you see it isn't exactly Carrey's best, but it's decent enough to rent. If you look at it as a romance, then you see it isn't very fulfilling, what with too much comedy and stupidity. Now I don't see it as one of these things.. I see it as a love story that happens to make you laugh. Two people practically MADE for each other that fall in love, a ridiculous premise involving a cult and a wise old man that sees the whole picture as the leader of that cult, and a lonesome and horny ex-wife. These three are the ultimate romantic comedy- no, no. Scratch that. This isn't a romantic comedy, this is a genuine love story with a pinch of humor. These three items make the ultimate love story, making you j*** in your pants because of the sheer awesomeness. When you go out to buy the DVD (and make sure you buy it, because you'll want to watch it over and over again) and watch it, wear protection.. No one likes sticky j*** of awesomeness in their pants..",2009

6,"The banker Carl Allen (Jim Carrey) is a lonely man with low self-esteem after his divorce with Stephanie (Molly Sims), for whom he still yearns; he avoids his best friend Peter (Bradley Cooper); he has a boring job, stalled in a bureaucratic position in the loan department of a bank; and he spends his spare time watching DVDs. When he meets by chance his former high school mate Nick (John Michael Higgins), he is convinced to participate of a self-help program called ""Yes Man"" leaded by the guru Terrence Bundley (Terence Stamp). The basic principle of the program is to say ""yes"" to new situations, leaving the negativism aside. Carl misunderstands the concept and says ""yes"" to every question. While leaving the encounter, he helps a homeless man and in the end of the night he meets the gorgeous Allison (Zooey Deschanel) that helps him with her scooter. His life completely changes with his new attitude: he becomes closer to his manager Norman (Rhys Darby) and is finally promoted in the bank; he experiences the most surrealistic and the weirdest situations, and becomes successful and with many friends, until the day that he discovers that sometime a ""no"" is necessary for an answer.",2009
6,"The premise is good: that kind of sectarian gregariousness that turns people into a brainwashed flock, only to scream ""Yes! Yes! Yes!"" at a ridiculous guru's finger-snapping - and its impact over one's life.",2009
7,"The comedy, Yes Man stars Jim Carrey as Carl Allen, a man, who upon realizing he's losing his friends since he never wants to see them, agrees to go to a seminar as asked by an old friend named Nick (John Michael Higgins). The seminar is a yes seminar, in which a man named Terrence Bundley (Terrence Stamp) talks about the importance of saying yes to everything. Carl makes a deal with Terrence that he will say yes to everything, or else have bad luck for not saying yes. This leads to meeting a gorgeous biker chick/aspiring musician named Allison (Zooey Deschanel). The relationship, although involving an age difference is sweet, tender, and funny. Carl soon figures out the most important lesson of them all: you will not succeed in life being the boring, always refusing guy he is. As you dig deeper in the story, Carl soon figures out how to live life (going to nightclubs, traveling the world, getting hyper on red bull, etc.) Rhys Darby also steals some scenes as Carl's wacky boss, Norm. Although the movie certainly does have its flaws, and it is not anything new, it is an enjoyable comedy you should definitely see.",2009
8,"Thankfully Jim Carrey has toned down the crazy antics he used to use,he is still doing crazy silly things,BUT since he has gotten more mature. his comedy has toned down & he has become a much better performer. He is not a one may show in YES MAN, the other characters do there share of the comedy.",2009
9,"Jim Carrey returns to his comedic roots in Yes Man, a movie that tells the story of Carl Allen, a man frustrated with his life that one day decides to say yes to everything and everyone. It is a film that offers a very optimistic view on life in general and shows that you can't be 100% negative but can't be 100% positive either, need to have a balance. Yes man give you an hour and a half of pure comedy with hilarious situations and very funny jokes. But it also has it romantic side without being corny. The cast is very good. Jim Carrey with a performance that makes us laugh like only he knows, Zooey Deschanel is very convincing, She and Carrey make a nice couple, they have very good chemistry together. The secondary roles from Rhys Darby (Norman), Bradley Cooper (Peter) and Danny Masterson (Rooney) give a good support to the leading roles (Carrey, Deschanel) and to the movie. In conclusion, Yes Man is a very entertaining and enjoyable movie that will produce you a smile at the end. Fully recommendable.",2009
10,"I thought that Jim Carrey quit playing in comedies and now will only do dramas because after Fun with Dick and Jane no new Jim Carrey's comedies were released (exept for Horton Hears a Who! which I haven't watched yet because I am not a big fan of cartoons) until this film came out. I heard that it's based on true story, so I thought that it's ain't going to be funny. I was so wrong. This movie was great. It's very similar with movies Liar Liar or Bruce Almighty, in other words - a typical Jim Carreys comedy. Not only it's funny, but it also has a great plot and a very optimistic mood. I think I'm going to try to say yes to everything at least for one day. It's such an inspiring movie.",2009
8,"OK, I have to tell you a true story, you're not gonna believe this. I tried this ""yes"" thing a couple years ago, in late 2006. The first thing I did was accept an offer to teach English in China (I'm still here), then I was invited into dozens of Chinese homes, I agreed to an idea to ride a bicycle from my city to Beijing (about 600 miles), I was thereafter featured in the local newspaper, and through no real talent of my own I made an appearance on national Chinese television giving an interview and singing a song in Chinese.",2009

But they did discuss the top movies to see and The Bank Job was in their top three, I finally found a theater that was still playing the movie, I saw it today and I have to say that I really loved this heist movie. It's definitely one of the better heist movies in a very long time because it brings something different to the table, this isn't a movie about the heist, it's the aftermath of the heist. We are always usually left wondering if the robbers got away with the heist afterwords in movies. Now this movie is based on a true story, it's based in the 1970's(bonus it doesn't remind you every 10 minutes) and it's about just amateur robbers that pulled off one of the largest heists in England's history with finding corrupt cops and ending badly.",2008
10,Film-making at it's finest.,2008
7,"Sold to the American public as another D-level action pic staring Jason Statham, ""The Bank Job"" is actually a crafty British heist flick based on an incredible true story. The screenwriters deserve credit for creating a serviceable script with so many intertwining stories based on little actual evidence, conjecture, here-say, and conspiracy theories revolving around royal and political sex scandals, militant Caribbean drug lords, undercover MI5 agents, bumbling crooks, crooked cops, and double-crosses and cover-ups. It could've easily been a confusing mess, but providing the viewer pays attention, ""The Bank Job"" gets the job done as crackerjack entertainment.",2008
8,"I'll be honest, I only saw The Bank Job because I had some free tickets for an advance screening, had I have not got these tickets I would not have bothered seeing it. The only trailer I had saw for it just didn't really appeal to me, I do enjoy Jason Statham movies, but this one seemed a bit serious in my eyes. Still I went today to the 6.30 screening and was surprised to enjoy it quite as much as I did. Admittedly for the first half hour I did get quite bored, the characters weren't really memorable and the set up seemed really dull. Thankfully when the heist gets under way, and especially the aftermath, the movie hits top gear and left me thrilled. The fact the movie is based on a true story still leaves me quite amazed, as the events that happen seem purely like the stuff that you see in the movies. How much of it is real and how much of it is purely to make it a better movie, a fight involving Statham I am certain didn't happen. The performances are surprisingly well rounded, Statham doing a brilliant job and the majority of the supporting cast getting some great scenes. Alas the movie does start to fall apart under close inspection, the plot is never concluded quite as well as I would have liked, and the movie does have some long stretches where not a lot is happening. If you can overlook this fact then you will a lot to enjoy in this very well made movie.",2008
10,"I expected this movie to be somewhat entertaining, and maybe a bit cheesy. After all, it's not difficult to muck up a heist movie. However, this film gets it all right. The acting is top notch, the story is not only engaging and clever but TRUE (!), and the experience of seeing it is thoroughly enjoyable.",2008
9,"I'm old enough to remember this robbery well, and the film does a great credit to a very true story, Jason Statham is Terry a very small time hood with a car lot (like Arthur Daly) who get lured into this bank Job by one time girl friend Martine (Safron Burrows-who l saw in Enigma) she is very beautiful, along with some mates they do the robbery, masterminded by Peter Bowels, a long way from his smooth Richard De Vere days in To The Manor Born, mind you he's still smoothie in this film, also along for the ride is David Suchet as a London Porn King, and Georgia Taylor one of the Battersby girls from Coronation Street. The film moves at a hell of a pace, and slowly builds to a great climax, l don't want to give away any of the plot all l can say is go and see this film, l admit l went to a pre-release night, but l might even go and see it again it's that good, l give it 9 out of 10",2008
7,"As caper flicks go, all I really hope for is something that succeeds in being both novel and entertaining. My hopes were satisfied by The Bank Job. The plot itself is based very loosely on events that occurred in the 1970s in London. The royal family has some dark secrets. An outspoken activist/petty criminal/drug importer has evidence of these secrets, which he uses as leverage against the government who desperately wants to prosecute him. This evidence is stored in a safety deposit box within a London bank. British Intelligence conjures up a rather reckless plan of employing a bunch of two-bit/amateur criminals to break into the vault, and take the evidence along with whatever else they can carry out. Apart from one intermediary, none of the robbers know the government's secret agenda. Of course, things get complicated whenever the possibility that a bunch of dirty secrets are in the wrong hands, and eventually the movie juggles several interconnecting plot lines, all related to the contents of the vault and their implication on various interests from the royal family, to corrupt police, to the sexual indiscretions of parliament members.",2008
8,"I also saw this film at an advance screening. I don't normally watch any of the trailers before going, so tend to go in with an open mind. I was very pleasantly surprised, and while it perhaps won't win any Oscars, I thought it was well acted in the main with some faces you'll recognise. It might not have massive appeal outside the UK, however it is a good (based on fact) story. I'm not a massive fan of 70's music, but it wouldn't have done any harm to have a bit more in the background just to give it more of a seventies feel about it. The general mood of the film was good and for me seemed to set the scene well, without going overboard with sex or violence. On the whole, it's well worth a visit, even if you have never lived in that era.",2008
8,"Sporting complex consequences for a relatively straightforward plot, The Bank Job remains intriguing throughout as each set-up leads to ever more suspenseful twists for the likable group of ragtag antiheroes. Over-thorough character introductions cause a slower build in the early stages of the heist, but such complications likely arise from fewer liberties taken with the ""based on a true story"" events, and the result is a fascinating look at criminals, the corrupt, and those least guilty.",2008
10,"This will be one of the best heist movie's you see in years. This movie is full of intense action and great wit. You will literally be at the edge of your seat up to the last minute, wondering if someone is either going to get killed or is someone going to get away. It is full of realistic drama, action, ultimatums, conspiracy and lust. At times it gets kind of scary and your heart will beat faster simply from the music. It is based on true story with a few additions of its own. The movie is put together absolutely perfectly.",2008
7,"In this serviceable but not extraordinary film based on real events and set in 1971 London, a group of amateurs pull off a bank robbery that goes wrong in a lot of interesting ways. Prompted by an ex-model former girlfriend named Martine (Saffron Burrows), Terry (Jason Statham) recruits a group of friends to tunnel into the safety deposit vault of a Lloyd's Bank on Baker Street. The alarms at this particular branch are temporarily off for adjustment of a new system, just as Martine told Terry they would be. The metal drawers hold millions in jewelry and cash. Things seem pretty dicey more than once during the ambitious robbery, but the crew does succeed in taking away the loot.",2008
10,"Diane and I watched this marvelous movie several days ago on the recommendation of a friend and we were far from disappointed; the movie was a cracker and we both indulged ourselves in a crime movie with out the accompanying Hollywood histrionics of car chases, crashes, fistfights and assorted bloody mayhem to entertain the folks in the Heartlands.Because the story was true and the details of the case even 37 years after the fact are still officially masked, the whole viewing experience is extremely powerful. The movie is of course plot-driven and what a plot it is. It must be hugely difficult for the actors in such a movie because they know, regardless of how well they conduct their acting tasks, the audience will be absorbed in the script and the""what happens next syndrome."" However, all the actors in hindsight, did not interject one (at least for me) discernible misstep in their collective performances.The sum total is a movie of sublime excellence that only the British seem to be able to carry off so well. It is in this respect an old fashioned movie, meant only in superlative terms. It is a movie to be savoured in all respects.",2008
10,"I had a lucky opportunity to see ""The Bank Job"" at a special evening advance preview screening somewhere in the wonderful U.S.A., and I have to write that I think it is a very interesting and energetic movie. I am a fan of Jason Statham and I think this is the best work he's done on film, even better than ""The Transporter."" Usually Statham plays a bad guy or a guy with a bad streak, and this time is no exception. But I really got a sense of how determined Statham's character was to protect his family from the fallout from the legendary bank robbery. I also really like the incredible 1970s feel of the film - it was as if it had been made in the early 1970s, what with the great rock music, the depiction of the swinging sex scene in London, the perfect costumes, and just the general overall style of the movie's look. I also loved the pacing of the movie, which was quick and up-tempo. Things moved along really well. I also liked the movie's different plot elements and its understanding of how money can corrupt everyone, even the upper crust, and how a scandal must be dealt with to avoid shock to England's Royal family. The movie is fun to watch and I enjoyed it thoroughly. It's definitely well-worth seeing. I don't know what movie the person who commented about the tunneling saw, but there was hardly that much tunneling - maybe a few quick scenes to establish things. They were in and out of the tunnel quickly. I never felt that the tunneling went on and on. And the pacing of the movie is so good that nothing drags or seems overdone. Statham's character reacted perfectly to everything that went on around him. This is a darn good movie, with good action and excellent acting. Saffron Burrows is very good and alluring and David Suchet really played the sleazy porno king very well. I would recommend this movie to fans of Statham, Burrows, and Suchet, to people who like caper movies, to people who like looking at London, and to people who enjoy the buzz that existed in the 1970s.",2008

8,"Jason Statham is well on his way to becoming typecast. It seems like he's in a ton of these kind of action films lately, although this movie is a bit more subdued and complicated than some of them.

6,"In it's own small way ""The Bank Job"" attempts the same trick that the writer James Ellroy pulled off so well in his fine novels ""American Tabloid"" and ""The Cold Six Thousand"". That is, to weave a connected narrative from matters of public record (the Baker Street Walkie-Talkie heist and subsequent D-Notice, the disgrace of certain Conservative government ministers due to sex scandals and the fall of the criminal Michael X) and public rumour (the indiscretions of Princess Margaret, the involvement of Lord Louis Mountbatten in British intelligence operations and the true extent of police corruption and involvement with certain London based porn barons of the early seventies). It works, kind of. The problem with ""The Bank Job"" is that it takes too long to get going.",2008
6,"The most dangerous lies are those that are based on kernels of truth. This is why I cringe whenever I see the ominous words 'based on a true story' advertising a film. The Bank Job is the fictionalized story of the walkie-talkie robbery that took place in London in 1971. A small team of Cockney lads, existing on the margins of criminal milieu, successfully robbed the safety box vault of a posh branch of Lloyd's Bank and, on the face of it, got away with most of the proceeds. The film uses some of the facts (the crew was indeed spotted by a ham radio operator, only a handful of safety box owners made any claims) and lots of gossip (the rumour was that one of the safety boxes contained naughty exploits of a royal princess, another implicated a cross-dressing Lord Mountbatten) , then adds some of its own inventions: MI5, or was it MI6, staged the whole operation to recover the pictures and there was also a ledger detailing payoffs to crooked police by a porn king (David Suchet, unfairly looking like the late Ronnie Corbett). Jason Statham, as Terry the leader of the crew, does his Jason Statham act and the rest of the cast turns up to give reliable performances. The whole film works in its contrived and rushed way, but it is much less than what it should have been. The look of the film tries to emulate the 1970s heist flicks but the director (Roger Donaldson) is not sure whether he wants to make a Boulting Brothers style heist romp or a more grungy Brit gangster film. Light-hearted scenes suddenly give way to brutal torture of likable characters, farcical asides lead to serious exchanges. The look of the film, although generally true to the era, sometimes appears sloppy or rushed (underground signs, for example, look distractingly modern).",2008
10,"It's no coincidence that Mickey Rourke is responsible for the comeback performance of the year if not the decade. Rourke's life and tumultuous past parallel Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson's own life so eerily close it becomes clear that no one else could have ever played this role. Darren Aronofsky's fourth feature is not only his most intimate but also his most accomplished to date. Aronofsky offers his most simplistic film both visually and narratively and ends up creating a film that has more depth and layers to it than any of his previous films.",2008

9,"The Wrestler won the Golden Lion a few days ago in Venice.

10,"Enough has been written already about Mickey Rourke's real-life parallels with his fictional character in The Wrestler. Yes, it makes the story seem even realer, and is perhaps what attracted Rourke to the project. (Or perhaps not  perhaps, instead, it is what attracted Darren Aronofsky to the actor.) But to focus on such surface similarities seems like an undermining of his work here. Rourke may not be as out-of-his-comfort-zone as Sean Penn in Milk, the only other Oscar-worthy lead performance this year, but that is merely a testament to his fundamental understanding of his character: Randy is an understated guy with big scars, both literally and figuratively. He's been wrestling for years  now reduced to borderline tribute shows in front of dwindling crowds, scrounging up barely enough cash to buy the variety of drugs and steroids he needs to maintain his weight. He lives in a trailer park and gets locked out for not being able to keep up rent. He works part-time at a grocery store and visits strip clubs regularly, because it's the only place where he seemingly has any meaningful connections with another human being  namely the dancer Cassidy (played by Marisa Tomei), who is similarly a bit older than most peers in her ""profession,"" yet doesn't really know any other way to live.",2008
9,"Very rarely an artistic come back is so pointed, so truthful and/or so honest. Mickey Rourke is extraordinary here and I can assure you, he'll break your heart. ""It's not over until you (pointing at the audience) tell me its over"" Who was saying that? Mickey Rourke himself or his character? Both, I think both. I felt a chill run down my spine, the kind of chill you feel when confronted by an unvarnished truth. Darren Aronofsky is definitely someone to watch and to follow. His characters face limit situations and he finds torturous paths for them to travel. What makes the whole thing endurable is the unmistakable signs of self awareness. In ""The Wrestler"" the painful meeting between Ram and his daughter (played by Evan Rachel Wood) have the overwhelming weight of the truth without a hint of sentimentality. As we are approaching Oscar season I imagine already a fight to the finish between Sean Penn for ""Milk"" and Mickey Rourke for ""The Wrestler"" They both deserve the highest accolade. What a year!",2008
10,"The authenticity is the hallmark of this movie combined with vivid cinematography and set design. An amazing career-best performance from Mickey Rourke and outstanding work by Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood, the film is very powerful and emotional. Again, an exceptional achievement by a true artist-Rourke. His performance is so penetrating, wise, and authentic that it deserves the Oscar. Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson was the biggest wrestler in the world, back in the 80s. Now it's 2008 and while things have changed, in his head he's stuck back in good old days. He's still wrestling, even though the money and his audiences are long gone. His aging body can no longer take the punishment. Aronofsky really captures the magic in Mickey's performance. It is the true essence of method acting. He is ""The Ram"".",2008
9,"Mickey Rourke returns to the big screen in Darren Aronofsky's brilliant character study, The Wrestler. Mickey Rourke gained about 35 pounds of muscle to play Randy 'The Ram' Robinson and looks the part of an old beaten down wrestler. Aronofsky creates a cold atmosphere that leaves the audience feeling as old and depressed as Rourke's character. The Wrestler doesn't have the look or feel of any previous Aronofsky film, it is mainly hand-held and has a gritty look to it that gives it a documentary feel. This film sucked me in. I really felt for the main character. I felt his pain and anger throughout the film. I felt his desperation. When a film has you reflecting the emotions expressed on the screen then it has accomplished something. I also appreciated that the story focused on two professions that are frowned upon in society, that being professional wrestling and stripping. Both professions are linked in the film and has the audience realize how similar they are. We also see the hardship of carrying out such a profession. I really enjoyed this film and had the pleasure of meeting the director after the showing. I was most impressed with him and can't wait till this film gets released.",2008

10,"I saw the movie at the world premiere in Venice and Mickey Rourke, Darren Aronofsky and other crew members were also in the audience. When the credits began, people were jumping out of their seats (including me) applauding and cheering for more than 15 minutes. It was really amazing. I have been a Rourke fan for 10 years now and to me Darren Aronofsky is one of the greatest directors of the last ten years. So when I entered the cinema my expectations were as high as never before. But this 40 Euro ticket was worth every cent. I never saw such a moving performance by ""Sir Eddie Cook"" who played Randy ""the Ram"" with such authenticity that I was paralyzed for almost two hours. And that's because Rourke isn't just playing ""Ram"", he IS ""Ram"", at least a part of him (there are many parallels to his real troubled past). Aronofsky really did a great job and really pushed the actors to their limits. It is amazing to see how a good director can turn such a simple story into one of the greatest movies I have ever seen (and I watch hundreds of movies). So everybody who grew up in the 80's with wrestling, hard rock and Nintendo or just loves movies should see this - at least ten times. God bless you Darren, Mickey and all the other crew members for the best cinema experience I have ever had. no doubt about it.",2008
6,"There is no denying that Darren Aronofsky's ""The Wrestler features two tremendous performances by Mickey Rourke and Marisa Tomei. But there's also no denying that former The Onion editor Robert Siegel's screenplay is rather conventional, plot-wise. And that does hamper this film.",2009
9,"In Darren Aronofsky's brilliant character drama The Wrestler, Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson (Mickey Rourke) is a down-and-almost-out pro wrestler who grapples with his own mortality and a fear of being alone and desperate. Rourke is phenomenal, delivering a powerful, highly physical performance that will knock your socks off as much as if he'd clotheslined you himself. Rourke's Randy is intrepid, a scarred battle cruiser who desperately needs to be in the ring to survive, a man who's emotions are kept as close to the vest as possible, a man with nothing else going for him other than his time in the spotlight.",2008
8,"Rarely does a talent like Mickey Rourke get a second chance at stardom. As the star of popular 80s films such as ""The Pope of Greenwich Village"" and ""Nine ½ Weeks,"" Rourke was on the verge of super-stardom when addiction to drugs and alcohol left him a ""broken down piece of meat."" But we don't want to hate Mickey, we love Mickey. He stole the show in Sin City a few years back but now he has completely returned to top form. We are looking at the Hollywood version of Lazarus.",2009
8,"""The Wrestler"" is a beautiful movie, but it wouldn't be half as good if Mickey Rourke hadn't given the main character a face and a heart. There's virtually no other Hollywood actor that could have embodied Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson as perfectly as Rourke, and it's shocking to think how the movie could have turned out had someone else, say Bruce Willis or - as originally planned - Nicolas Cage played the part. With Rourke it's not so much an actor memorizing lines and delivering them convincingly, it's like watching a guy having gone through hell and now showing his scars. Rourke's performance even lets one overlook some rather clichéd elements in the story (the exotic dancer with a golden heart, the neglected daughter, a dance in a romantic dilapidated ballroom). It's all good, because one look at Randy's face reminds us of all the hits and punches he must have taken in the past, and it all becomes real again.",2009
8,"Billed as Mickey Rourke's big comeback, this film is the finale presentation of the New York Film Festival 2008. Awarded in Venice and shown at Toronto, it features a winning performance by Rourke. It's a simple story, a mixture of raw authenticity and old fashioned corn about a washed up professional wrestler who's 20 years past his prime and resists admitting it till he has a heart attack and is forced t turn to the only two people he has in his life, a lap dancer and an estranged daughter. It's pretty monochromatic and claustrophobic, but the tiny framework shows off Rourke's generous, authoritative performance. Rourke's weathered, soulful face and sweet-sad smile sell the movie.",2008
7,"OK, after all the talk, literally, talk after talk of how wonderful Mickey Rourke's performance was in The Wrestler and that he's finally back in action. So I just had to see what all the hype was, especially after everyone started panicking when Sean Penn took the 2009 Oscar for Milk, I was curious if this movie really was as good as everyone was making it to be. So I'm going to give my honest opinion which either is going to get me a lot of hate mail or the ""un-useful"" marks on my comment, but I'm an honest user, I tell it like it is. The Wrestler is actually a really good movie, I would say that it was one of the top 10 that came out of 2008, but one thing that I really didn't like about the movie was the way it was made and the ending, which I'll explain why in a moment. Mickey Rourke does pull in a top performance, including Marisa Tomei, they took us on this heartbreaking story and made the movie into a small gem.",2009
8,"I really enjoyed this movie, which tells the tale of Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson (Mickey Rourke), a former big-time pro wrestler fallen on hard times, most of which seem to be the result not of bad luck but bad planning and bad habits. Forced to compete in violent and dangerous stunt matches with other former big-timers and young wannabe wrestlers.",2009
10,"It's a fascinating thought I had going into Darren Aronofsky's The Wrestler, screened at the Toronto International Film Festival. I began to worry that a straightforward tale may not be playing to the director's strengths. It wasn't until the end credits that I recalled Requiem For a Dream being an adaptation and his debut π being pretty grounded in reality despite its surrealistic tendencies. So in actuality, the guy had only made one non-straightforward film, and all to immense success, at least in my eyes. So, as of now, the guy is four for four. Not only does Mickey Rourke own the screen every second of the movie, but Aronofsky lends just the right amount of his stamp on the proceedings, creating a definite top ten inclusion for my end of year list and, by far, the best film I had seen at the festival.",2008
8,"As someone who's a fan and who has actually worked behind the scenes in pro wrestling, I can tell you that Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson's story is a very respectful and realistic portrayal of the toll pro wrestling takes on its stars' lives. Certainly not everyone in the biz ends up as destitute and lonely as Randy was - some do, definitely - but those who end up well-off in every sense of the word (like Hulk Hogan, John Cena, Stone Cold Steve Austin, and The Rock, for instance) are VERY, VERY rare. Most end up somewhere in between.",2011
9,"There is no greater blow to the ego of a once formidable athlete or entertainer than when the cheers stop. ""The Wrestler"" is a poignant film because it touches on two fears most people have at some point in their lives: irrelevance and loneliness. Former pro wrestler Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson (wonderfully played by Mickey Rourke)was once a superstar but now is a broken down, financially strapped has-been living in a trailer. He is estranged from his teenage daughter, whom he left years ago. His only meaningful relationship is with stripper Cassidy, herself a middle aged person in a profession filled with younger competition. When a heart attack forces Ram to stop wrestling, he realizes just how difficult it is to transition away from the only life he's ever known.",2009
9,"The Wrestler is probably Rourke's defining work to date. He shows a depth to his acting that his rarely come through in his earlier films (including the excellent Sin City). The story evolves gently, deliberately, notwithstanding the interjection of the violence surrounding the wrestling matches. Most importantly, the director does an excellent job of showing the mutual respect and camaraderie that exists among professional wrestlers - a code of honor that ultimately attracts and keeps Rourke's character engaged in the world of wrestling 20+ years after he has passed his prime. The storyline also does an excellent job of helping viewers empathize with why fans like what they probably know is pre-scripted wrestling, and finds a chord of genuine-ness in their cheers and emotions. This chord of truth in fans' adoration and emotion is what the Rourke character finds so difficult to pull himself away from, and at the end, why this seems more ""real"" to him than the real-world. As the movie progresses, it becomes clear that the professionals wrestlers - men line Rourke's character share a higher code of honor among themselves and genuinely look out for each other. Outside of this world of peers, the Ram is completely dysfunctional and unable to operate any of his relationships effectively - whether with would-be girlfriend Cassidy (Pam)or daughter Stephanie. Ultimately, the story is heart-wrenching, and it draws its viewers in, unfolding with great heart and emotion, just like its protagonist. Highly recommended!!",2009
7,"I know that title sounds a bit rough, but i did not hate this movie. quite the opposite in fact. i'm actually surprised in how much i enjoyed this movie. i really only rented it for the 3-D, but you know what? i had a lot of fun. and honestly, that was the best movie i've seen Brendan Frasier in since ""the mummy"". Brendan really is a lot better in action films then he is in comedy or romances. he should stick to action.",2008
9,"The reviewers of ""Journey"" are probably all correct: the logic is spotty, the premise is silly, and the requirement of the audience to suspend disbelief is beyond a typically successful film. However, despite all of that, I liked it! I went to see it because in my small town the offerings are rather slim, and I had seen everything else (is it me, or did this summer's films seem a bit clichéd and lame?).",2008
6,"I was not dreading watching Journey To The Center Of The Earth, but at the same time I was not thinking it was going to be the best movie ever either. I was simply ready to be entertained. Well, when it started up, I immediately became interested, because it looked enjoyable and entertaining and I was being fair on it, no matter how much it was against my nature to try and bash it. ",2008
5,"First off, let me say that I'm VERY glad I saw this movie in 3D. If I hadn't, I might have walked out. The instant strength of this film that comes to mind is the great use of the 3D technology. It has plenty of surprises, and it doesn't over do it at all. HOWEVER, this does not excuse the blatant cheesiness, stupid typical one liners from Brendan Fraser, nor the underutilization of such a fantastic concept.",2008
1,"Brenden Fraser and co. were capable and amiable enough to pull it through. The 3-D was a lot of fun. The movie itself was a joyride - a mindless joyride, that is. Just what do these people have to do to get hurt? I could slip in the bathroom and be out of commission for days, yet this fearless trio can literally fall thousands of miles down a hole and not get so much as a bruised hiney! They can speed over 60 mph on a rickety 60+ year old mine car without being derailed and jump farther than those Duke boys could in the General Lee! They can out run a T-Rex on the open field, explode through a volcano thousands of feet, cling to the underside of a rock like a fly, endure 130 degree heat without breaking a sweat, eat trilobites and not get the runs, and crash a hang glider from a thousand feet without skinning an elbow!!! At least the 1950's version retained some veneer of plausibility. These people even survived fiery explosions without a blister, found each other over scores of miles using a compass, and all in one and a half days? Yeah, I had fun watching it, but later on, you realize it may just have been the stupidest film you've ever seen! At least the script didn't call for the actors to take each other seriously, but this also robbed the film of any suspense whatsoever. Kind of like in a Spielberg film - you just know the kid's not going to get hurt no matter what. This film needed a villain or two because you just knew none of these three morons were going to get hurt. Just a 3-D vehicle for the sake of 3-D stunts.",2008
8,"I first saw the trailer for Journey to the Centre of the Earth last Christmas when I watched The Nightmare Before Christmas in 3-d. I also remember clearly thinking what a load of rubbish it looked like. It appeared to be a gigantic gimmick, cashing in on the latest 3-d technology. The various TV spots and images I saw of the movie in the past few months has done absolutely nothing to dispel this notion. However this past week something happened I didn't really expect, the critics were giving it quite decent reviews, most praising it as ridiculously good fun. I was still sceptical, but also in some way intrigued, perhaps the trailers were just poorly done. So I went to see the movie today, of course in 3-d (more on that later) and was absolutely amazed at how entertaining the movie really is. While the movie does feel like a gimmick at times, do we really need that yo-yo scene, the movie also does seem quite well made. The performances too were good for a movie that really could just have been a cash in, Brendan Fraser is surprisingly likable and good in the movie, and Josh Hutcherson continues to deliver performances that all Hollywood kids should be delivering as good as. But most importantly its so much fun, the action sequences looks incredible in 3-d, and the landscapes of the actual Centre of the Earth do look beautiful. This is a 3-d movie, and make no mistakes by thinking it is worth watching in 2-d, it really isn't. The movie is a kids movie, and so we get an all too happy ending, but there is a brief moment of darkness before the end, and that too makes the movie all the better for adults.",2008
6,"Plain and simple: this is a kids' movie. If you're an adult and you saw the previews with some genuinely-scary looking scenes and thought, ""Wow, this looks cool"" - be warned. Some of it is cool, but most of it isn't.",2008
4,"So I just got back from a screening and I thought the movie was OK. Overall, it was just the regular adventure-movie. The actors weren't bad, but I had seen better performances of them. The story is kind of a standard one. A guy with no close relatives has to watch over a boy and goes on an adventure with him. I'm not gonna spoil the ending, but I'm probably not gonna be able to... Now, I do have to say that I wasn't bored during the movie; it was acted out well enough, and it had its thrilling moments. But those things wouldn't be enough to recommend it for, though. My main concern was that some scenes were just too obviously made to make the movie adventurous. (like a 'rollercoaster-ride' in a mine). The only thing I would recommend it for would be the Real-D. It's a huge difference with the regular (IMAX-)3D. The image is crystal clear, and it all looks very realistic, and it seemed like some shots were especially made for the 3D-effect (which really made me jump sometimes). So, if you're interested in new techniques, go see it in 3D, it's an interesting experience. The movie itself is just not really worth your money. It's a regular adventure-movie with good SFX, but nothing original or special in it.",2008
6,"Jules Verne's ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" is probably one of the last sci-fi classics that really was screaming for a new 21st Century film version. While Hollow Earth sci-fi was extremely popular in the late 19th Century, its implausibility is generally apparent at this point even to the unwashed masses. Who knows why the producers decided to pick this particular story? Maybe it was in the public domain. It's certainly not sacrosanct, but seems a bit silly.",2009

4,"This movie was another movie in the long line of only good because their in 3D movies. The story and acting was awful, and it felt like I was watching a cheap imitation of Indiana Jones. Brendan Friser's charm can't win this one (hopefully the Mummy 3 is better). The script is just awful and the movie was boring 10 minutes in. The movie was only about 90 minutes and it felt like it dragged on for hours and hours. The plot and some of the things that happen are just stupid and almost like a farce even for a Verne novel. My best bet, don't spend the extra fee theaters are charging for this 3D waste. The 3D effects are awesome, but wasted in this golden turkey.",2008

Josh Hutcherson is always adorable in films, so this was no exception. Just the concept and the fun was enough for me to be entertained. Watch this movie! You'll be glad you did. The whole cast is amazing, the scenery is amazing and I bet this was gorgeous in 3D. Anita Briem was amazing as well and she was amazing in this movie. Just watch this film for yourself and then you will see how truly amazing it is and I guaranteed to love it as much as I have. If you don't, then you don't but for sure give it a try.",2012
6,"Brendan Fraser again is an amiable action hero with a young nephew (Josh Hutcherson) in tow for a buddies adventure that includes a pretty (but boring) female guide as Fraser's eventual love interest. Let's fact it--nothing original about the story but it does feature some neat special effects (courtesy of CGI), not all of which are totally convincing, but hey, this is a kiddie romp if ever there was one.",2012
6,"Originally released in 3D (I've not seen it in that format, sadly), Eric Brevig's take on the Jules Verne novel updates it to modern day and sends Brendan Fraser, his nephew (Josh Hutcherson) and Icelandic babe Anita Briem down to, well, the centre of the Earth. Where of course peril and wonderment await in equal measure. As adventure films go it's entertaining stuff as the intrepid trio run, dive, jump and fight their way through the hazards of a hot land that's getting hotter by the hour. The kicker in the story here is that they are saying Verne's novel is true, giving birth to a collective of people known as Vernians who believe this to be so. Therefore for plot drive the book is used as a sort of tourist guide to aid them in their attempts to escape from the Centre of the Earth. Cool or what? The production design is excellent, marking the film out as being very visually appealing, while a number of the set pieces are genuinely entertaining and suspenseful. It moves along at a good clip, too, and the three actors carrying the film engage firmly on the good side of good, especially Fraser, who can do the heroic kooky act with ease.",2012
5,"The new remake of Journey to the Center of the Earth is one far cry from Jules Verne's original novel. The classic old version from my childhood with James Mason, Arlene Dahl, and Pat Boone set during the 19th century in Verne's time is not anything you'll recognize here.",2008

When I read that the original writer left because the film was turning into a theme park ride, that immediately set alarm bells ringing and the end result is nothing more than that.

1,"Eden Lake masquerades as a touching and dark film BUT it is quite the opposite. I, like another reviewer, had to register just to express my deep disappointment in this film. Sure, it starts off with a normal setting which you, as someone who is most likely used to the typical spiral into chaos, would expect. This however, turns into complete ridiculousness. The acting was such that, one feels that the characters themselves had NO faults and that it was Mr. Watkins who cruelly killed off such well-to-do people. ",2012
1,"I just recently saw a movie called ""The Children,"" where all of the adults acted like whimpering babies as their 30 pound sandbag kids murdered them.

1,"Sickening violence and a thoroughly poor understanding of human nature. Most of the characters completely bypassed typical responses to the situations they were confronted with. No attempt was made by the couple to reason with or even talk to the children, to try to turn them against each other, for instance, or make them think about how they'd likely spend the rest of their lives in prison for their crimes. Even a simple ""don't do this"" would have added a desperately needed touch of reality. The other kids also could have easily ganged up on the leader and stolen the phone from the girl, so why didn't they, and how does one of the children go from being completely unwilling to do harm to the man to shoving a razor into his mouth? Would they really ever have thought they'd get away with three murders? The questions just pile up, and the ending was a tragic confirmation of the writers' juvenile ""violence is cool"" mentality. This trash should never have been produced, and by the way, I made an account just to spit on this pile of garbage. I've seen a lot of movies, and this was irredeemable.",2012

Stylistically it was well executed....good pacing, lighting, camera work, musical score. The only thing missing is a story worth telling. And the story Eden Lake tells is one of complete hopelessness in the face of evil. This type of garbage appeals to the basest impulse in some people, who enjoy seeing human beings tortured to death. There is no redemption, no consequences for the evil acts. In the dismal, sadistic vision of the screenwriter of this film, mankind is basically evil at heart, and the good will be slaughtered like lambs. Compare Eden Lake to Lord of the Flies, another film dealing with evil adolescents. In Lord of the Flies, we are shown a balanced view of human nature, one providing a metaphor for the good and evil duality in all men. The majority of humans turn to charismatic leaders for guidance, and those unlucky enough to choose evil leaders ultimately pay a high price. Because humans are for the most part good, the evil doers in life can only persist for short periods before they are eradicated by the majority who want safety, security and stasis, rather than pain and anarchy. The evil kids in Eden Lake commit the most horrendous of brutal murders, and get away with it. The end. Sound like a film any normal person would find gratifying to watch? It is a symptom of a debased culture when its citizens find it enjoyable to watch innocent people tortured to death, with their murderers receiving no punishment for their crimes. It takes a sick mind to write this stuff, and a sick mind to find pleasure in the viewing.",2009

7,"(Synopsis) Jimmy ""Dodge"" Connelly (George Clooney) is the team captain of the Bulldogs in the struggling pro football league in 1925. The entire pro football league is in danger of collapsing, one team at a time, and his team is next. Dodge gets an idea of saving the team by recruiting a college football star who fills the college stadium with over 45,000 cheering fans. With the lure of big money, Dodge is able to convince Carter Rutherford (John Krasinski) to drop out of college and join the team. Carter is not only a star football player who can outrun his completion, but he is also a national war hero of WWI who single-handedly captured a platoon of German soldiers. Lexie Littleton (Renee Zellweger) is a newspaper journalist assigned to get Carter's real inside story about the capture of the German soldiers. To get the story, Lexie must travel with the team, and in time, both Carter and Dodge fall for her. Only one will win her love as the fourth quarter comes to an end.",2008
6,"George Clooney's latest homage to the Golden Age of movies brushes ever so closely at times to the classic screwball comedies of the '30s and '40s, but falls short in both the carefree laughs and whimsical romance. No one else even tries though, so Clooney's efforts are much appreciated and do culminate in a fairly unique romantic sports comedy.",2008
7,"Having just seen the movie and read the other comments I felt I had to respond. OK, so the dialogue is a little clunky in places and there is no great emotional journey or powerful moral at the end so accept it for what it is - a nice little movie that passes a couple of hours and leaves you with the feeling that you've been entertained. Why is it that people always expect George Clooney to do powerhouse / classic films?? Maybe he wanted to make this because he liked the story and thought other people would too? The characters are simple as is the story but it never pretends to be anything big. It's a light hearted caper that does nothing the offend the senses or damage the careers of anyone involved. Let it wash over you! My advice? Go see it and make up your own mind, who knows - you might even enjoy it.",2008
7,"I saw Leatherheads today, despite the negative comments here at IMDb. On the whole, I agree with the 'movie-guy: Doug' who ventured that this is a ""slapstick comedy that is cute and enjoyable to watch"". I'd add that this is a comedic period-piece, which is pleasant and witty, rather than hilarious and knee-slapping (if you want to get technical). It offers excellent sets, costumes and characterizations typical of the Roaring 20's when Newspapers were godlike, and Radio was just unfolding.",2008
4,"'Leatherheads' tries so hard. Tries to be light hearted. Tries to be a comedy. Tries to be a love affair. Let's see, it tries to be a 'His Girl Friday' by way of 'The Sting' by way of 'It Happened One Night' by way of a dozen sports movies. Alas, trying isn't doing and the movie is as soggy as the last game's field.",2008
7,"""Leatherheads"" is a movie of laughs, and feel good fun a period piece of football nostalgia that's held together by it's slapstick comedy and blended well with romance. George Clooney who stars and directs gives a good turn here, yet it seems a little uncommon seeing the superstar in a period comedy piece as he's clearly a better dramatic actor still he scores some points here for his style of shooting and direction of the film.",2008
10,"Reading some of the other reviews, maybe people thought this was supposed to be a heavy movie? If so, lighten up. This was (and was supposed to be) a light-hearted movie. And it was pulled off very well. Acting by Clooney, Zellweger, and others captured the spirit of the era, including humor, dress, and scenery. ",2008
8,"While the dialog is clever and the acting is up to par, the mix of sports and romance ultimately falls flat. The legitimizing of football in the 1920's is the main plot point, with Clooney's Dodge Connelly attempting to popularize it through recruiting war hero turned college football phenomenon, Carter Rutherford, played by Krasinski.",2008
5,I saw an advance screening of Leatherheads at NYU Movies101 last night.,2008
1,"A lot of the negative reviews here concentrate on the historical accuracy of this film. OK, it had about as much to do with the actual NFL as your average war movie has to do with an actual war, or a Western has to do with the true ""old west"". So, I think we should give them an artistic license pass on that one.",2009
8,"Leatherheads is a highly enjoyable movie, full of period-era sets and language that throws you back into the days during World War II- though it doesn't completely set you back in that day, as George Clooney and John Krasinski still act in a way that tries to be throwback, but remains modern.",2008
10,"Leatherheads takes place in the 1920's and is about a professional football player named Dodge Connolly who is also the head coach of his team. Dodge's team soon loses sponsorship and they are forced to resign. Being out of work, Dodge soon reads about an up and coming war hero and college football star named Carter Rutherford who he convinces to play on the team and because of Carter's star power, Dodge soon gets the team up and running again. Meanwhile a reporter named Lexie Littleton is going to be writing an article on Carter and soon Dodge meets her and falls in love with her and after first being turned off by him, Lexie soon starts to like him as well, but things get complicated when Lexie uncovers something for her story on Carter, that could hurt him and the team and Dodge, with feelings for Lexie soon has to straighten things out with his love and his team. Even though the film is called Leatherheads, and most of the advertisements show the film as a sports film, really the football aspect is only a backdrop to the romantic comedy part of the film that is really the main focus. The filmmakers of Leatherheads, must have been big fans of the romantic ""screwball"" comedies of the 1930's and 40's and this is truly a salute and tribute to those movies. That being said, Leatherheads captures everything about those films and the charm, wittiness, comedic performances and style that made those films so distinct. The film's look from the sets right down to the costumes look exactly like the 20's films and in capturing the mood of the 40's comedies the writers have provided a very humorous story filled with snappy and clever dialogue between the characters, numerous situations that resolve themselves with a lot of comedic intelligence and first rate performances from the actors who all do their best job of capturing the comedic performances of that era. Leatherheads works so well because it appeals and does it's job so well for a couple of reasons. First off the story and writing is sharp, funny and tells a very entertaining story with a great backdrop and sets from the crew and also because of the performances, timing and skill of the actors delivering the lines and situations to perfection and doing the best of what they are given and what they are given is very good. Overall a classic tribute to the comedies of yesteryear done with perfection and told with a great knack for such films and delivering a very entertaining, funny and classy film that I think will appeal to many people and will work on the same levels that they worked for me.",2008
8,"I thought that this movie captured the 1920's very well. It was a refreshing comedy that brought you back to a time in the past. Although I thought the transitions and story line moved a little slow, it was a nice and fun weekend movie. ",2008

10,Sorry to all the naysayers...,2008
9,"Months ago when I saw an ad for ""Leatherheads"", my first thought was: How many movies can Hollywood possibly make about football?? We've had ""Remember the Titans"", ""We Are Marshall"", ""Friday Night Lights"", ""Rudy"", ""Radio"", ""Any Given Sunday"", ""The Longest Yard"" (original and remake), ""The Program"", ""Varsity Blues"", ""Jerry Maguire"", ""Hometown Legend"", ""Facing the Giants"", ""Necessary Roughness""  shall I go on? Even the Marx Brothers fooled around with the sport in ""Horse Feathers"".",2008
4,"~Leatherheads~ Last night I saw the MOST highly anticipated movie of the month!! Actually, I've been highly anticipating this movie since nearly two years ago when it was announced in Charleston that George Clooney was scouting shooting locations for his new movie that would be starring Renee Zellweger. A few months LATER (in the PRIME of my Fancy New Beesly-dom) I found out that John Krasinski had been cast in the movie & have been counting down the days until it was released. Clooney. Zellweger. Krasinski. 1920s costume, demeanour, & music. This movie could have no plot & I would love it.",2008
2,"I thought this movie was going to be good. It absolutely wasn't, despite the Oscar-winning lead actors. I may have laughed once, and I never heard anybody else in the theater laughing. Renee Zellweger's pancake make-up was very unbecoming. Everybody seems to be trying so hard in this movie, running around in imitation of slapstick but not pulling it off. I think perhaps the movie must've sounded good in development, but something got lost in translation. Were the roaring 20's really like this? I think not. Everything seems a tad artificial. Randy Newman's score was annoying. The film is in sepia tones, just like every other movie that takes place in the 20's or 30's. There's just not that much originality here.",2008
3,"Greetings again from the darkness. The worst thing you can say about a movie ... comedy or drama ... is that it is boring. George Clooney's ""Leatherheads"" goes beyond boredom straight into snooze-fest. Attempting to follow in the footsteps of the great Preston Sturges and Howard Hawks screwball comedies, just two things are missing: screwball antics and comedy dialogue.",2008
2,Leatherheads was a very boring movie from the very beginning. I had a hard time staying in the theatre for the whole movie. This is a movie where you mostly hate it or love it and I strongly didn't like it. I thought the acting was very good and they were fun to watch for older people. I guess I mostly didn't like it because I am younger. It was just way to slow moving and never picked up. The messages were saying its okay to cheat and lie. George Clooney was just a cheater the whole movie when he played football and never changed. The whole movie had like about three laughs. The laughs they did have were small. I mostly didn't like how it took place in the 1920's. It was very real and shows you how football really started. The romance was very confusing and pretty boring. Everyone in this movie was very selfish and wanted everything for themselves. The story was pretty much not even about football. It revolved around war and other stuff. One more thing is that the whole movie was all sarcasm. So if you like sarcasm you will probably like this movie. Overall this movie was very boring and a waste of money.,2008
7,"Clooney's third directorial outing, and his followup to the Oscar nominated Good Night and Good Luck. This movie is quite a bit lighter, a screwball comedy about the early days of professional football. Clooney stars as a pro football player for the Duluth Bulldogs in 1925. The sport is not very popular at this level, but is insanely so at the college level. His plan to increase attendance and save the sport is to recruit football and war hero John Krasinski, who plays for Princeton, onto the team, though college football players rarely go on to the pros. Meanwhile, a reporter from Chicago, played by Renée Zellweger, has discovered that Krasinski's war hero story is bunk, and plans to expose him. While never hilarious, it's quite an enjoyable movie. Clooney, I think, is a more talented director than any of his three films have displayed. I think, if he ever gets his hands on a great script, he'll knock out a truly great film. He captures the period detail well, and the photography is great. I think the film would be a whole lot better without Zellweger. I'm not necessarily a Zellweger hater, but she's staggeringly awful here and drags the whole film down a notch. I like the whole fin de siecle mood. Nothing especially memorable, but a good time.",2008
5,"""Leatherheads"" is a producers dream. On the one hand you have a story about the early stage of Pro-football to attract the guys and on the other you have one of those playful 1920's romances where the characters do and say witty things, which I'm going to assume women dig. So the movie contains all the right ingredients. All that needs to happen now is the parts need to show up on the screen, but oddly enough, the movie underwhelms in both regards.",2008

10,"Just came back from watching the movie and I was definitely pleased. I was a bit worried that I would be let down after reading some of the early reviews, my suspicious about the reviewers not understanding the character were confirmed though.",2008
10,The Punisher has been portrayed twice on film so far. First in the 80's flick with Dolph Lundgren and more recently in the 2004 flick with Thomas Jane. While both were OK in parts the movies as a whole just weren't that good. Being a huge fan of the comic series I have always felt that they had never pushed the violence far enough for a Punisher film. He was always to restrained. So how did the third attempt at a Punisher film work? Lets see...,2008
10,"OK, folks...here's the deal with this movie...if you go to the video store and you're looking for something deep and meaningful, Punisher: War Zone is going to seriously disappoint you. If, however, you are in the mood for just senseless violence, blood, guts, exploding heads, and a lot of cool ways to watch people die, like in Friday the 13th, then I can PROMISE you Punisher: War Zone will NOT disappoint! Go into it and take it for what it is and what I've told you it is. You're not going to come out of this movie with some new profound sense of the universe or some profound understanding--again, if that's what you want, stay far, far away from this movie. But if you wanna see a lot of people get killed and dismembered in a lot of different, gruesome bloody fashions, then this movie is right up your alley! A dude I know told me this, I went into this movie knowing this, and was NOT disappointed in any way, shape or form--it's what I wanted and it's what this movie delivered, and that's why I'm giving this movie a perfect 10 stars!",2009
7,"Roger Egbert was spot on when he wrote - """"The Punisher: War Zone"" is one of the best-made bad movies I've seen"". Viewed independently, it is an ultimate men's movie and more fun to watch than all Steven Seagal movies put together. This movie does not hold back on anything like the wimpy Thomas Jane's Punisher, who was more of a schemer than a punisher. That movie had its own reason to be liked in that it was a brave move to bring an ultra-violent (Punisher has even used nuclear bomb to kill an otherwise unkillable villain), gory and very dark comic, which only had a cult following, to the mainstream cinema. While that movie did not feel like a comic book adaptation at all, the story being pretty ordinary and plot being too heavy, war zone is much closer to the source material. Corny situations had corny, and extremely violent solutions. Villains were perfectly cast and did feel like Punisher villains and got what they deserve from a Punisher. The accents were distracting in the beginning, but once you get used to them (which is pretty fast, since everyone uses a fake sounding and bad accent), you stop noticing it and focus on action, which is plenty. Ray Stevenson was a perfect cast and comes across the perfectly believable, imposing and intimidating killing machine as the Punisher. The much-maligned first scene actually set the tone for rest of the movie for me, when Punisher goes on a killing spree on the dining table, killing everyone on the table, men-women alike, in different, but extremely bloody way. That is Punisher for me. Perfect movie for fans of Punisher and violent action movie fans in general.",2008
10,"I am a Huge Punisher fan. This movie destroys the other two in my opinion. I was expecting a piece of crap from the reviews I read and boy were they wrong. This movie is a non stop kill fest. It shows everything from heads exploding to decapitations. As a horror fan I love that. As a Punisher fan that's the way it should be. I wanna see the scum of the world get their heads blown off, not cut off at the last second like most movies do. Ray's portrayal of the punisher is perfect. In the first scene of the movie when he's wiping out the dinner guests and he breaks the neck of the mobsters wife I knew I was in for a treat. Loooooooooooved IT.",2008
9,"Just got back from this tonight and I was not disappointed! This is a better adaption then the 2004 version and 1989 version. For me, Ray Stevenson is THE PUNISHER!!!!I like Dolph and Tom's interpretation are good (though Tom Jane's performance is more of a Taxi Driver character then a Punisher), Stevenson was the best and showed a wider range of emotion, a great voice, fighting, guns, and all together look and feel of Frank Castle.",2008
10,Ray Stevenson did an amazing job portraying exactly how the Punisher should have felt. You were able to get a real glimpse into why he does the things he does. No remorse for the wicked and evil. ,2008
10,"Taken on its own terms, ""Punisher: War Zone"" is everything it is supposed to be: excessively violent, larger than life, fast paced, and almost always loads of fun. War Zone doesn't take itself seriously and it doesn't ask the audience to do so, like the '90 and '04 films did. It never ponders the morality of its hero any more than necessary; it's The Punisher for gods' sakes.",2008
7,"If you have ever read the famed comic books containing the hero Punisher, then you are in for a special movie treat. This dramatic story is called "" Punisher: War Zone. "" Writer Nick Santora allows his imagination to run rampant and in doing so, creates a solid story-line which will have audiences gasping by what they've seen. Ray Stevenson plays Frank Castle, a professional Ex-soldier who's wife and daughter were murdered by street thugs, drug dealers and gang members. In this story, Castle/Punisher goes after the Italian, Russian and Asian mobs in an effort to clean the streets. However, one of the most vicious gang leader suffers a horrific disfigurement and takes the name of his deformity, called 'Jigsaw.' (Dominic West) With his phychotic and deranged brother 'Loony Bin Jim' they set out to destroy Castle, his friends and anyone close to him. The entire movie is one exciting, slam, bang and explosive tour through the bowels of hell. It was surprising to see Wayne Knight as a courageous Micro in among all that black gang and destructive mayhem. If you are looking for an exciting, gut wrenching and certainly bullet ridden film with bodies flying everywhere, this is your movie. Black as pitch, written for the dog-eat-dog audience, this movie creates a spiral stairway into the very bowels of darkness. ****",2010
8,"After watching Dolph Lundgren kill a record number of Mafia and Yakuza villains on screen in 1988 as the original Punisher, I found my ideal superhero/antihero. Frank Castle was a man that wanted only one thing; to wipe evil off the face of the earth by any means possible.",2010

7,"The newest Punisher movie lies at about the extreme of how good a bad  movie can get; so bad it's good should be this movies motto. I enjoyed  the previous Punisher movie with Thomas Jane as a guilty pleasure and  it continues as such with every consecutive viewing. Punisher: War Zone  takes this principle to a delirious high and former fighter, director  Lexi Alexander certainly has a flair for directing high quality dreck.   On a purely visual level, this film trumps its predecessor and is  indeed quite slick and well shot. Along with such artistic clarity  however, follows copious amounts of blood and brutal sadistic violence,  which at times repulsed me to a certain extent. For those who found the  previous outing violent, will find themselves wincing more then in any  other movie this year. It is this choice to turn The Punisher, Frank  Castle, into a purely animalistic killer (Which truthfully is probably  what he should be) that distances the audience from his blight and  makes this B movie a pure action film; and features little dialogue, no  character development, just pure unadulterated havoc. Replacing Thomas  Jane, is Ray Stevenson, who I loved from HBO's short-lived series Rome  and he certainly suits the part; Brooding, ruthless and savage in his  ways. A reboot, more then a sequel, Punisher: War Zone features all new  characters, a fresh back-story and a pristine batch of baddies to  dispense of.   Following a crimson soaked encounter at a Cosa Nostra summit, The  Punisher has found a true nemesis (A disfigured Mafioso calling himself  only Jigsaw (Dominic West)). However, during this encounter an  undercover FBI agent is killed by Frank Castle, the former Special Ops  agent, and wracked with guilt, hovers behind the widow and daughter of  the agent. Feeling a sort of connection to the two with his own  slaughtered family, he fosters a protective tendency over the pair,  which ramps up when Jigsaw seeks revenge against the family of his  crony who was, obviously, an undercover operative. Recruiting his  imprisoned brother Looney Bin Jim (Doug Hutchinson) following a feisty  prison break to aid in his revenge, Jigsaw wages a war against The  Punisher, his friends and goodness in general.   The high point of this film is undoubtedly Dominic West as Jigsaw, who  oozes malice and over-the-top sadism and is certainly the best villain  sincewell Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight......never mind. His brother  is equally insane, but is more laughable in his place then West's  portrayal. Wayne Knight as Castle's ally, plays the role surprisingly  straight and departs nicely from Newman on Seinfeld. Really,  truthfully, don't believe for a second that this film is a good movie,  it is corny, clichéd, supported by minimal dialogue, and by all  standards a bad, bad movie. Yet, damn was in fun.",2009

8,"OK first thing people say about it is that its not as good as the first one. Which i can respect that opinion, but if you watch both movies you realize they are two different movies! This one shows the more brutal, and carefree Punisher that all comic book fans know and love! Where the first one is the emotional side(which is not a bad thing). War Zone steps away from the death of his family a little, and focuses on the other aspects of The Punisher. Ray Stevenson in my opinion is the perfect punisher, hes mean, rough looking, and has the perfect attitude! Now I will give you the fact that the acting is kinda off, but aside from that, this is a great, balls to the wall action flick! Check it out, and make your own opinion! Both films are great! Just watch it with a very opened mind! Enjoy!",2010
8,"First I prayed that if there is a second movie I hope some else would cast as the punisher than Thomas Jane. Well prayers answered it was Ray Steveson. I liked his performance as the punisher. He has a much closer appearance to the comic, cold, powerful, intiminating and shows no remorse in his eyes when killing his foes. His acting was good and his voice sounds so cold that makes Thomas Jane sound like a girl. Good on you Steveson I hope you get to stay.",2009

This movie looked like a TV movie, especially in comparison to Punisher 04. As a typical reboot...they overdue what the fans were asking for. they wanted more action...they gave us too much! and so unrealistic too, and stupidly cheesy. heads blowing like cherry tomatoes from 9mm. Punching through peoples skulls.",2009
8,"I have read a good deal off bad comments on this film as to being unrealistic and enormous plot holes in the script, to the far end of over-acting and well the worst I have read is the part of completely over the top bad acting. And then I am not even mentioning the fact that many people are comparing this movie to real classics like Die hard and Lethal weapon (as far as they can be very realistic, but that is an entire other discussion). Now I had never heard of Alexander Lexi before as a director, never seen any of his work, so when I saw the movie I had no idea what to expect of this director. I had seen, like many of u Ray Stevenson in Rome and before that in King Arthur. And I have to admit I am a fan of this raw acting man. He is perfect to portray the emotional torn Frank Castle. And people pls lets not forget this is based on a comic book character, a character that in the marvel universe ends up fighting the Hulk, Spidey and lots of other superheroes and villains. So please lets not get into a discussion about realism. The comic book character has gone through tremendous lots of changes also, in the beginning he was indeed a lot more like the character portrayed by Thomas Jane. Though but not so down to bottom violent and gruesome. There was still a bit of humanity left in him. Although that Ray also portrays that in this film with the daughter of the undercover agent he accidentally kills. But the most successful comic book release of the character is the series where he is drawn from his most dark side possible. And that is the side that Lexi portrays in this picture. Frank is raw, uncontrollable, totally lethal and absolutely without mercy. And that is what the punisher is all about, there is no second chance with him, there is only one punishment and that is the capital one for him. Ray brings a nice depth in his character when he lets the audience know that it is exactly that punishment he seeks for himself also, he does not pretend to be a angel, he knows his deeds are unforgivable, but he is only responding to a world where criminals do not follow the same conduct of our society as we do. He responds to them in the same fashion and sometimes even harder then they do to us. But he seeks no redemption for his acts as he knows what he does is fundamentally wrong. So bravo Ray and Lexi for bringing this in the movie, it was very refreshing to see that twist. Anyway the movie is fantastic and it is a roller-coaster ride for all the action fans out there. The characters are well portrayed and the criminals are two dimensional, but that is the way it should be in comic adaptation for the screen. Not only that but Dominic West really brings down an absolutely fabulous Leather Face. So for me a well deserved 8 and I am looking forward to a sequel to this movie.",2009
8,"I saw this last night and it was actually quite good. I mean as a Punisher film which captured the feel of the recent Garth Ennis run of comics for Marvel I find it hard to fault, however there is something missing that I could not put my finger on until today. As ridiculous as this might sound I feel the film needed more of the over the top violence it was touted as having too much of. Ray Stevenson's depiction was perfect because you have to understand how surprisingly hard it is to play Frank Castle. Too much scowl, your a ham, no expression and you are wooden, but he balanced it right and nailed the character. Jonathan Hensleigh's Punisher (with Tom Jane) from a few years ago was an OK revenge flick but it may as well have been called ""Mad Max the remake"" as Hensleigh made no secret of the fact that the movie was a giant homage to the first Mad Max. It really was not The Punisher at all (scene with the Russian aside). Warzone had a low budget exploitation film flavour to it and I was staggered to hear the film cost 22 million dollars to make. You just can't see it on the screen which is one of it's shortcomings and why it will not break even financially which is unfortunate as it rules out sequels. Jigsaw was good but I think audiences will subconsciously compare him to a villain in a little movie people like call The Dark Knight and find him the inferior product. It will not be released in cinemas in Australia which is unfortunate when other drak such as Taken and Unborn get a run and are no better. All this aside the movie is worth checking out, but needed a bit more of the black humor and brutal bloodletting of the comics. Perhaps an unrated cut is forthcoming.",2009

9,"Watching this film is like taking a look back in time. Everything is picture perfect, the beautiful automobiles, the red electric street cars, the telephones, the switchboard station with roller-skating supervisors, the house appliances, and the outstanding clothing, from dresses to hats to police uniforms, everything is meticulously detailed. The story, which we are told is true, is complex and multifaceted. Angelina Jolie, who plays Christine Collins, gives an outstanding performance as a single mother who returns home from work to find that her son is missing. This puts into motion a series of events that exposes the reality of what Los Angeles society was really like in the late 1920's. Corrupt Police, uncaring and self absorbed mental health professionals and the basic premise that people left to their own ambitions will do anything to secure their own prosperity. Although this paints a bleak picture of the human condition, the film show that the actions of a few good men can make a world of difference, John Malkovich as Reverend Gustav Briegleb, is determined to expose the corrupt Police in his radio talk show, Michael Kelly as detective Lester Ybarra, although hampered by his superiors, uncovers what really happened to the boy and the unlikely hero, a powerful attorney who takes her case pro-bono comes to her rescue. If indeed this is a true story, then to see these people stand up to the powers that be is a ray of hope to all of us that there were people who were strong and principled. We can only hope that there are still people like that out there today.",2008
10,"There is nothing more reliable than Eastwood behind the camera, with his assured touch his films are never boring or deliberately confusing, hiding technical devices or special effects that detract from the most important part of movie making: a good screenplay, a good story, good acting. For the past 10 years, many films have been unduly praised because they have one or two great performances, unfairly leaving many good and deserving movies without the recognition they deserved. Eastwood has however, given us the whole package time after time, with movies as varied as ""Mystic River"", ""Letters"", ""Million Dollar Baby"" and now ""Changeling"". True, there is a link, they are all strong films, with themes that deal with pain and loss, but the stories are different, the settings require an amazing attention to detail, what they all share is a strong focus, and interestingly enough, superb performances.",2008
9,"Changeling - In 1928, Single mother Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) returns home one day to discover her nine-year-old son, Walter, is missing. She calls the police and, after enduring a grueling 24 hours, they search for her son. But the boy they return to her is not her son. After confronting corrupt city authorities, Collins is vilified as an unfit mother and sent to an asylum.",2008
9,"Wow, is this an involving story. It hooks you in fast and really grabs hold. It's very good in that aspect because it really makes you care about what happens. The story involves a parent's worst nightmare, so I would expect moms and dads to be particularly horrified. The movie manipulates, no doubt being overdone here and there, but it's generally effective.",2009

9,"Angelina Jolie, for outstanding performance in Changeling.",2009
8,"Clint Eastwood's newest project, Changeling, is sort of awesome, sort of annoying. The true story of Christine Collins, a telephone operator and single mother in 1928 Los Angeles, has a promising script and cast, but fails to accomplish any major feats on screen. At times the dialog feels forced. For example, when Jolie adds an ambient ""Sport"" moniker or makes references to Cleopatra. It's as if Eastwood is saying to the audience ""Yes, this really is 1928, I promise."" Historical accuracy is important in a film claiming truth, but Changeling is a bit like scaling a wall there is not much to hold on to.",2008
7,"The production design and Angelina Jolie's performance dominate this lengthy but rushed tale by director Clint Eastwood. Los Angeles 1928 is truly stunning. We walk the streets of a Los Angeles we've never seen but it looks and feels eerily real. The magic of CGI used to its best advantage. Then, Angelina Jolie, giving a mature and powerful performance as the victim of a disturbed mind and a corrupt police force. Then, the rest, doesn't seem well thought at all. Doesn't Angeline have a photograph of her son to show everybody that the child delivered by the police is not her son? The children, all of them, look and sound like performers of an elementary school theatrical production. Why I wonder? When the period details in the movie are so accurate, why the heaviest of details, the credibility of the supporting performances, are so weak. The writing doesn't help. The baddies are totally bad and the goodies are totally good. Jeffrey Donovan's corrupt cop is really unforgivable. So on the nose without nuances of any kind. Terrible really and very, very annoying. ""Changeling"" however survives its movie of the week heart, thanks to a truthful and compelling Angelina Jolie. I'm repeating myself I know but so does the film.",2008
10,"Summary says it all, this is the most challenging film so far of 2008. Deep and daring, Clint exposes corruption within LAPD in this period piece. Brilliantly executed and finally a performance I appreciate from Angelina. Also stellar performances by John Malkovich, as well as Amy Ryan, Jeffrey Donovan, Michael Kelly, and others. This film drives it home which any parent can appreciate and will remember for some time.",2008
8,"Clint Eastwood is one of the legends of the silver screen, from his humble beginnings as the Man With No Name in Sergio Leone westerns to Dirty Harry the kick-butt cop. As a director, he has given us some of the finest stories we could ever see, including the Oscar-winning Unforgiven, Million Dollar Baby, and the war epic twins Flags of Our Fathers and Letters From Iwo Jima. With his new film, he explores the dark side of the earlier part of the twentieth century in Tinseltown (Los Angeles). Taken from true events, the story unfolds that a single mother Christine Collins has lost her nine-year old son, Walter. She asks the LAPD to intervene, and about two months later, her son is returned. Then, she says it isn't her son. She never looks back.",2008
7,"With Changeling Clint Eastwood has yet to end his streak of auspicious film making. Though not one of his best it is certainly worth watching. Changeling is a film about a single mother's (Christine) search for her son with a twist. Rather than the LAPD trying to help her they oppose her. As a result of receiving bad publicity for being unable to find her son Walter after five months, the police deliver Christine her ""son"". He is not really her son, he is a fraud. Christine immediately recognizes the boy isn't her son and quickly points this out to the police. She realizes she now has to fight the LAPD in order to find out the truth about her son. But with her attempt to fight back and embarrass the LAPD comes intense consequences. ",2008
10,"Clint Eastwood, the master of making depressing films now makes his trilogy: Mystic River, Million Dollar Baby, and now Changeling. Based of the horrific chicken coop murders from the 1920's in California, we get a deeper insight into one of the mothers of the victims, Christine Collins who is portrayed by Angelina Jolie, queen of the never ending tears. I'm just playing, she does a terrific job and is just so heart breaking to watch her story on film, she gives Christine a lot of character and depth. The film is even made a certain way, a lot of dark colors, it seems as if it was made in old Hollywood, which was a very intelligent way of setting the mood and time of the film. We have some very fine performances pretty much from everyone in this movie. The one flaw I did feel is that the script does have some lines that are a little over done, a little too dramatic, but it really works for the film and story.",2008
8,"'Changeling' has a lot going for it in the eyes of the public just being directed by Clint and starring Angelina. Moreover the little-known but true LA story it tells is heartrending. A hard-working single mother in 1928, Christine Collins (Jolie) is forced to work on Saturday in her job as an assistant supervisor at Pacific Telephone and she leaves her young son Walter (Gattlin Griffith) at home. When she comes back he's gone. Five months later the police produce her son, found in another state--only she denies it's her son. The LAPD's reputation is on the line, and they force Christine to take the boy home. Then they try to discredit her as a lazy and unfit mother when she keeps insisting the kid isn't hers. Eventually she tangles more and more with the LAPD, who're going through an especially lawless period under a corrupt chief. They've shot down a lot of criminals in cold blood and swept away the bodies--just so the Force can control all the crooked dealings in town. Their arch-enemy and leader of the public outcry against cop corruption is crusading minister Rev. Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich), who seizes upon the Collins case when it becomes public, smelling a rat. After Collins has repeatedly opposed the cops and refused to accept the boy delivered to her--who's three inches too short and circumcised, has different dental work and is unrecognized by his schoolteacher--a willful Irish Captain assigned to this case (Jeffrey Donovan) orders her locked away in a psych ward. A lurid story of child abductions emerges.",2008
10,You must go see this movie. YOU MUST GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!! I'll admit I didn't know what to expect when my wife asked me to go to this movie. And of course having Jolie in it she didn't have to twist my arm to much. We had to go out of town to see it because our local theater wasn't showing it. The acting by Jolie was great. Eastwood's direction was great. And the 20's and 30's look to the movie was so realistic. I learned some things about this time frame by watching this movie. So not only did I enjoy the movie I learned a little bit along the way. This is a Rated R movie so I wouldn't take kids to it because there are a couple disturbing moments in the movie. If this movie doesn't get some Oscar nominations I will be very surprised. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!,2008
9,"It's ironic that because of the 1950s TV drama ""Dragnet,"" Los Angeles got the reputation of being a city with a squeaky clean, incorruptible police department. It's ironic because nothing could be further from the truth for much of the city's history.",2008
5,"I liked this movie less and less the longer it went on. Eastwood is an interesting director but his biggest fault lies in his inability to see the woods for the trees. Like the latter-day Spielberg, he just can't bear to end the movie or at least cut out scenes which stretch the patience. There are long, tedious swathes of this movie (the hearings at the end, the trial of the killer) which could have been drastically edited or (in the case of the outcome of the hearings) cut completely and dealt with in text at the end of the movie or in a far more succinct denouement.",2008

8,"Clint Eastwood returns to ""Mystic River"" territory in this period piece that digs deeper into LAPD's past in corruption. Anybody who thought that LAPD's bad reputation is recent would be shocked to find that it was as bad in the 1920's. Angelina Jolie delivers a powerful performance as a wronged mother whose son disappears. To add insult to the injury she's further abused by the LAPD who instead of finding her missing son, trying to use her for their benefit. The film has some minor problems with its length and the overbearing score by Eastwood as well but hopefully it will get fixed before its release in the fall.

10,"This one caught me completely by surprise. I can vouch for the fact that for a woman to lose a child, even in the course of as natural an act as childbirth (it happened to my mother), can be devastating (and the kind of thing that can haunt her for the rest of her natural life). To lose a child the way the real Ms. Collins did is even worse. Ask John Walsh. I'd never heard of ""the chicken coop murders"" before. It's amazing to think that something of such magnitude might've been consigned to the fires of forgetfulness if not for a writer happening across a pile of discarded paperwork... Even more amazing was the way Ms. Collins, so ably played by Angelina Jolie, soldiered on. Women are often capable of a kind of strength men can't match. (Just today, I saw my wife stand in line FOR SIX HOURS, in triple-digit heat, at a local church in the hopes of getting some dental work done... only to be turned away at literally the last moment. How she didn't break down is beyond me. Literally.) CHANGELING is a left hook to the chin that you just don't see coming: it undoes dental work, and it's the kind of movie you don't forget easily.",2009

Well when i finished the movie and got back home i gave my mom a big hug . Anyway the directing was a masterpiece and thank to Angelina the movie was brilliant and absolutely strangely moving i would watch it over and over .And Jolie deserved the Oscar for this role that was really a gorgeous and attractive way to see how much a mother loves her sun i wanted to see the movie the minute i saw the trailer,2009
10,"Well we decided to sit and watch Changeling after coming back off our holidays. I didn't have high hopes for it, and expected to go off to bed early in the middle of it. However. This movie totally stunned me. It had me hooked right until the end credits and I found myself wanting more. My eyes were closing because I was so tired, but there was no way it was being switched off! The film is very clever indeed. Rarely I feel in tune with the characters like I was in this film. I felt every single emotion, sadness, desperation, hope, brief happiness, anger, frustration-the list goes on. Clint Eastwood deserves a lot of recognition for this film as I feel it was practically perfect in every way. It delivers everything I like in a movie.",2009
10,"There's no jarring wooden dialog here, no overt exposition; Straczynski knows how to show rather than tell, and the powerful script does much to carry the film. As with most of Eastwood's films, it's artfully shot and directed and very pretty to look at. Eastwood wrote the music for the film as well.The part of the story content dealing with a child serial killer is difficult and shocking to be sure, but the film deals with it carefully and does not sensationalize, nor show gory details not necessary to the story (thank you Mr. Eastwood!). Angelina Jolie did a marvelous job portraying Christine Collins and the audience loved John Malkovich's performance as the Reverend. (You know their into it when they applaud during the show!) Being used to seeing Mr. Malkovich in 'bad guy' roles, I was surprised to see him as the good guy, but his performance was amazing, he truly pulled it off beautifully.",2009
5,"This movie was based on a true story, and if the makers had stuck closer to the true story it could have been a much better movie. But no, they had to Hollywoodize it and dumb it down so that anyone with the least knowledge of the game of blackjack and how casinos operate will be saying ""No way"" to themselves all through the movie. It actually ends up with a chase scene and characters running through the kitchen, for God's sake.",2008
6,"21 is definitely the major film for the spring time, it has young hot actors, including an incredible academy award winner, Kevin Spacey, and another great actor who's head looks like it grew quite a bit bigger, Lawarence Fishburne. So it has all the key ingredients for a good movie, a decent plot, over all a good combination of actors, and looks like a well put together movie. So I saw it this weekend and I have to say that I was a little disappointed, I think this movie was more for the teenagers, with the actors and the rating, I think it should've been more adult. It was a typical rise and fall story with cliché'd characters. Kevin Spacey, seriously my favorite actor, he's always a dead on hit with every role he takes on, but he seemed to just sleep his way through the film and didn't really care about it. He and new and hot up-comer, Jim Sturgess were not a bad couple on screen, but were not strong enough to hold the story into something original.",2008

I'm kind of glad that there was an Asian guy and girl that didn't really fit the typical Asian stereotype...Expect for the Asian guy being really cheap..but, I laughed at that...because I'm Asian myself and I'm cheap along with my family =x.

I thought it made the card playing parts actually riveting even though i am not a card player myself. i thought the acting performances were all good especially that of Kevin Spacey's. In terms of the story. In many ways it reminded me of all the good things that was in the BBC TV show hustle. But in a much more real way. On the down side, you may see the ending coming and there is a romance part of the film that feels unnecessary. However it is a very slick film that gets away with it. I would say that it clearly the best film in this genre of film. I enjoyed it more than films such as Confidence and the Oceans 11 type films. I would highly recommend it to anybody when it eventually comes out in April!! I would have thought that they would cut down and re-edit it a bit on the basis that it was quite long. however it kept my attention for the whole film and that is not something that is also done during these sorts of films",2008

7,"This film screened at the SXSW Film Festival in Austin, TX. It is a reasonable well-made based-on-a-true-story film that tells the story of a group of MIT students who attempt to make a fortune counting cards in Vegas. The screenplay apparently plays pretty fast-and-loose with the version told in the book. Never-the-less, the acting is excellent - especially Jim Sturgess in the role of the lead student. Honestly, his accent was so good that I didn't realize - until he came on stage afterward - that he was British. He does a great job with the mannerisms to give you a real sense of the character's evolution. Kevin Spacey and Laurence Fishburne are solid - although Fishburne's role is fairly small. The minor characters are not as well-developed as they could have been. The cinematography of both Boston and Las Vegas is quite good, especially on the big screen. It's an interesting story, but they could have edited down a bit to make it move a little quicker. This is a good film, but it probably could have been a lot better.",2008

The movie is all about supposedly very intelligent people, led by the smartest of the all the group, the only veteran in this college age-dominated cast: ""Professor Mickey Rosa,"" played by Kevin Spacey. Well, Rosa would not do what he did here, for starters, meaning trusting an untrustworthy and revenge-seeking kid. If you've seen the movie you know what I mean. The others in the group wouldn't go along with the renegade - ""Ben Campbell"" (Jim Sturgess) - either.

But if you are like me, where you realize that the story and the integrity of a picture is most important, then ""21"" is nothing but sheer boredom. Just as a measure of my ennui, I didn't have high expectations, but I looked at my watch for the first time at the forty-five minute mark. And my eyes shot back there every ten minutes for the remaining one-point-two-five remaining hours of the film before the credits finally rolled and I unleashed a big sigh of relief.

I couldn't have been more pleased. Was it the same as the book? Of course not (except for The Green Mile, what was?) But it was action-packed, smart, fun, well-acted, well-directed, and just plain enjoyable. Spacey, Fishburne, and Bosworth are at the top of their games and Jim Sturgess is going to be a star. The visuals were great, the editing sharp, and the score right on point. I don't know whether to stay up all night re-reading the book or hop on a plane for Las Vegas to try to win while I still halfway remember the counting system.

Things that jumped out at me were; The main character is supposed to be a genius and yet he hides over $300,000 in his ceiling?? No one is that stupid. Especially since there was no need for him to hide it at all; he won it gambling in Vegas, where gambling is legal, hello? He would have had to pay taxes on it but all he had to do was declare it as gambling winnings and open a bank account, or better yet, a short term CD to earn some interest. What did he plan to do, drop $300,000 in cash on the Dean of Admissions desk at Harvard Medical School? That would have gotten the IRS down on him in a heartbeat.

In The Last Casino, Professor Barnes is a broken down gambler with a serious debt to be paid. To buy himself more time he trains a group of math students to count cards and earn money for him and ends up biting off more than he can chew and his team can handle. That's about the only major difference between the two films other than big name actors in 21 and the characters in both films. Personally, save yourself the long agonizing trip, go to BlockBuster (Or go online.) and rent The Last Casino.

It's a little lengthy in the time and the writing was a little over done, BUT nevertheless it was still a good movie. It had terrific sets and was a beautiful setting, it felt like watching one of the old classic movies that made you feel good.

2,"Australia is a big country with skies and deserts that go on forever. The film of the same name is a big pile of cinematic excrement that should not have even started, let alone been allowed to go on for as long as it does. Baz Luhrmann, possibly the most overrated director in the world, was given $180 million to create this overwrought, schmaltzy garbage starring ice queen Nicole Kidman and bland-as-batsh*t Hugh Jackman. Fancying himself as the reborn David Lean, he went for epic and got Epic Stinker. He throws in the Australian government's disgraceful treatment of its indigenous people, a romance, a cattle drive, the bombing of Darwin by the Japanese, and a subplot involving a little boy with parents of both colors. The result is a mess. The CGI of cattle racing towards their doom is completely unconvincing and the bombing of Darwin, which can only be described as 'Pearl Harbor Lite', is directed with spastic indecision. As a romance, it's a complete failure. As history, it's totally shallow. As social commentary, it's all surface. If Luhrmann is doing anything as a filmmaker (in addition to running his career with one ballet shoe firmly in the closet), he's channeling the spirit of the late, great Liberace with his over-the-top bonanzas of glitter, camp and intolerable clichés. Unlike Liberace, he doesn't know when to stop playing. ""Australia"", by any measure, is a massive helping of Terrible that would make even dear old Liberace nauseous.",2008
8,"Baz Luhrmann has done a great job with 'Australia'. While cliché's and political agenda runs rife, this is set nicely into an historic, epic story in three distinct acts.",2008
8,"In 1939, the aristocratic Lady Sarah Ashley (Nicole Kidman) travels from Great Britain to Australia to meet her husband Maitland Ashley in northern Australia. The husband's drover (Hugh Jackman) comes to the city of Darwin to bring Sarah to their farm; however, when they reach Faraway Downs Farm, they find that Maitland was murdered apparently by the aborigine King George (David Gulpilil). Sarah befriends the half-breed boy Nullah (Brandon Walters), who tells her that the administrator Neil Fletcher (David Wenham) is stealing her cattle; has killed her husband; and is working for the cattle baron King Carney (Bryan Brown). Sarah fires Fletcher and his men and together with Drover, Nullah and a group of loyal employees, they ride together to bring the cattle to supply the army and win a tender in times of war. But the ambitious Fletcher has other intentions and uses Nullah to press Sarah.",2009
3,"I think the best word to describe this pastiche is ""ridicolous"" and not  in a fun, entertaining way. Baz Luhrmann's ego is all over the screen  but there is no visible sign of his intellect. ""Somewhere over the  rainbow""? Oh please, give me a break! Although the story is the wannabe  love story between a man and a woman the whole thing feels incredibly  camp and not in a fun, entertaining way. If I sound angry it may be  because I am. I sat for three hours! Three hours! To be told this  quilted compilation of other much better movies. Nicole Kidman is  always fun to watch and that is true also here but for the wrong  reasons. Hugh Jackman gets the most loving, sexy framings and close  ups. I'm giving ""Australia"" a 3 and not a 1 due to the young Aborigine  star and some spectacular locations.",2008
2,"Music from The Wizard of Oz is played and/or sung throughout the film and its characters are compared (unsatisfactorily in my opinion) with those of Australia. It's an in-group reference, since ""Oz"" is a common nickname for Australia.",2008
9,"I have always been a sucker for dramas set against Australia (I am a Yank), and this one does not disappoint. Led by top-shelf work by Kidman and Jackman, the movie has sweep, romance, excitement and a bit of mysticism. World War 2 has inspired some of the great films of the last half-century and this can emphatically be added to the list. Can it veer a bit towards melodrama, schmaltz and corn? Yes-but what great romantic epic does not? It pays homage to the great romantic war films while adding a dose of Baz's own quirkiness that keeps one from feeling they are seeing merely a facsimile. This kind of film is why they build movie theatres.",2008

1,"I'm sorry, I'm going to say it: those people who have found anything remotely good about this film, a single saving feature, they are either Baz Luhrman's friend, worked on the set, or lobotomized.",2009
8,"Baz creates another super enjoyable, visual spectacular! Although maybe not as good as ""Romeo + Juliet"" or ""Moulin Rouge!"" it certainly isn't much worse. ""Australia"" is a hugely enjoyable epic romantic adventure with plenty of exciting set pieces to keep you watching. I don't quite understand why nobody enjoys this? If Australia was made around the same time as ""Gone With the Wind"" I know that everybody would be drooling over it saying, ""Oh it's the best film of all time!"" Or whatever you call ""Gone With the Wind"" (I haven't seen it) because Baz has created a love-letter to those old epics and it's a welcome breath of fresh air to our screens.",2011
1,"Not sure if the making of this film was a cynical money-grubbing craft of old Hollywood genre clichés stitched together in soul-less fashion to try to evoke cheap emotional responses -- or if it is simply ineptitude. But this film is one shameful P.O.S. This felt less like an attempt to convey important themes and messages, more to manipulate an audience in ham-handed fashion. The treatment is artificial to the point of predictable, phony and Disney-esquire. I stayed to the end, but felt that I'd been ripped off by the filmmaker intent on making a buck, not to make a great film. A shame, I am a fan of Jackman and Kidman. Their acting was fine, the fault lies with the script and director.",2008
10,"This was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time, maybe one of the best ever. Baz has outdone himself again. Without the outrageous, colorful nature as Moulin Rouge! or Romeo+Juliet, Australia succeeds in being an elaborate epic romance. Nicole Kidman has not always been my favorite actress, but as in Moulin Rouge! she is brilliant in a role that allows her to go all out. Her character Sarah Ashley comes alive through the sheer weirdness of the actresses nature. She has the range to allow her character to evolve throughout the film. Hugh Jackman, what can I say about him? For several weeks before seeing Australia, I had been seeing him everywhere thinking 'what has he ever done? Sexiest man alive? No way?' etc. I was proved wrong. When he first appears, you do not see his character's, Drover, face. But when you do, the gasp from me and my two friends was proof enough: he is indeed beyond sexy. As if that wasn't enough, he can act like no other. In a chacter that could have been tough, he pulled it off, channeling the rugged cattle driver beautifully. Did I mention Brandon Walters as Nullah? The twelve year old boy stole the show as the sweet, conflicted Aboriginol boy Nullah. Really, for such a young child, he was stirring. With the direction and colorful backdrop to back up this fanatical acting and wonderful script, this movie is nothing but a classic in the making.",2009
1,"Where is Kevin Costner when you need him? The movie that this politically correct mish-mash of a mess most resembles is Dances with Wolves because in both actual history has been sacrificed in order to preach some sort of alternate theory in which civilization -- and its discontents -- is the villain in a world of happy mystical natives. The plot is one dimensional and the acting wooden. However, the fake history is quite imaginative. Indeed, there is little doubt that the authors would have been even happier if they had been able to portray the bombing of Australia as something of an American conspiracy and merely a defensive response by the Imperial Japanese. Oh well, perhaps next time that can be the storyline if education continues its relentless march toward misinformation. Dumb would be a compliment to all concerned.",2008
10,"Its an animated movie about a dog. GIVEN, its a 'kids' movie. Unlike many animated movies, the dialog isn't full of innuendos or 'hidden' humor that only adults would 'get'. Its easily understood by kids, the animation is top-rate (as would be expected) and the characters are engaging and easy to enjoy. I admit that even though I love animation, I went to this sneak preview with a few misgivings. The trailers didn't look all that exciting, and I didn't expect to see anything I hadn't already seen. On one hand, I was right. The animation WAS very good, but nothing that hadn't been done before. But on the other hand I was pleasantly wrong. The formula works perfectly for Bolt. It was fun, didn't have any 'dull' spots, and while my theater was filled with a fairly consistent mix of children and young teens, and a relative smattering of adults, everyone seemed to enjoy it. Laughter was pretty consistent among the old and young, and at the end of the flick I heard something I rarely get to experience in theaters these days: applause. Granted, the adults were the ones applauding, and I joined in enthusiastically. The wife and I agree that this was one movie where we felt we got more than our dollars' worth. Thats a rare treat. Bolt did not disappoint on any level -and will find a spot in our library when the DVD eventually hits market. I fully expect this movie to do very well.",2008
9,"I have been anticipating the release of Bolt for several months. I had an opportunity to see a screening of it and it exceeded all my expectations. Bolt is a wonderful movie with a good story and heart, something that Pixar has done well but Disney has struggled with. I believe the addition of John Lasseter to Disney Animation has made a significant impact on the quality and continuity of this film. Yes, it is CGI. You may ask, ""Why is Disney doing CGI when Pixar already does?"" All the studios are doing CGI right now. I have been very impressed with Pixar's CGI detail, however the detail in Bolt is even better. Creating a dog with fur that gets dirty, wet, wind-blown and looks real is very impressive (at least it is to me). In addition to better detail, the color and light of this film is so true to life, you'll think it's the real thing.",2008
8,"Standing out in the crowd is not always the easiest thing to accomplish for an animated film, but above what you may expect, against WALL∙E's heart, and Kung Fu Panda's slapstick hilarity, Disney's Bolt jumps forward as simply the most fun. ",2009
10,"The 2000s have not been very kind to Walt Disney Animation. While there has been the occasional Emperor's New Groove or Lilo and Stitch, the majority of their films from this decade have been rather mediocre (most notably 2005's Chicken Little, which - ironically - remains the studio's highest-grossing film of the 2000s). With that said, I initially had some doubts about Bolt, despite hearing that it would be Disney Animation's first film supervised by Pixar founder John Lasseter. The surprisingly positive reviews posted shortly before the film's release convinced me to buy a ticket. Thankfully, I was forced to eat my words; welcome back, Disney.",2009
10,"I was really not expecting much, was looking to one of those generic ""newgen"" 3D animations but, oh, I was so wrong. I can easily say Bolt is pretty much at par with Wall-E, the 2 21th century animations that conquered my heart.",2008
10,"We got the opportunity to see this in a sneak preview in 3D and were very entertained. Great plot, great animation and the 3D was amazing. Sometimes felt like Bolt's head was towering over the audience. Good thing he didn't drool!",2008
10,"I can't remember any film produced by Disney that I ever disliked. Every movie they made, whether it's Pixar or not, is a great movie to watch. Bolt is no exception. In fact, this brings Disney to another level.",2009
10,"""Wall-E"" was superb, I love and admire it/him, but ""Bolt"" does beat it! While the above mentioned (excellent!) movie did have some slow, insipid and predictable moments, in the spaceship setting - well, ""Bolt"" is coherent, self-consequent and true to itself from beginning to end! ",2008
8,"I've read that Bolt is the first computer animated feature to come from Disney Studios since Pixar's John Lasseter took control of it, and it's easy to see the Pixar presence in the movie. John Travolta and Miley Cyrus provide the celebrity voice talent for the movie, about a dog who stars in a superhero TV show but who is just as unaware that he's an actor as he is that he's a dog. ",2009
9,"Over the past few years Disney track record in new movies has been questionable. With the exception of Meet the Robinsons (which I quite liked), Disney has done nothing but pump out rehashed ideas in the form of inane sequels to classics loved by my generation or weak under developed characters. Well not this time. I managed to see an advanced screening of this tonight with my daughter and it had both of us highly entertained. Bolt the ""super"" dog was full of funny and emotional characters the likes of which Disney has not produced in a while. And for once the comic relief characters, of which there are many, did their jobs and pulled even the slowest of moments out of the trash and send you rolling in the aisles. Rhino the hamster was my personal favorite. After seeing this movie all my daughter could say was how awesome it was and ask if we could see it again. I had to remind her that it actually does not come out until next week. Well to sum it up I would recommend to children young and old and while I have not seen it yet in 3D I plan too because it was easy to see that 3D is going to make the movie even more exciting.",2008
10,"Now don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of animation and I loved recent films like WALL-E and Kung Fu Panda, but this one is without doubt the best animated film this year or the last.",2009
10,"This movie was enjoyable all around. I saw a special screening last tuesday and it was great. I found that kids felt they were intwined with in the movie. It made you feel like you were right there helping out Bolt and his friends. The character traits and development were well done. From the pigeons of New York to the pigeons in California every character had their own special personality. The graphics were superb and it made you feel as if the movie was real. John Travolta does the voice of Bolt. I wasn't sure if at first he was a good choice, but he made Bolt his own. Miley Cyrus was really good as the voice of Penny. She did well and her timing was great, but the real character that made this movie was Rhino the Hamster. He steals every scene and you and your kids will be quoting his lines for weeks to come. I saw take your kids to see this and don't worry it is great for adults too.",2008
6,"Bolt, I honestly don't know what to say about this film because honestly I feel bad about saying this, I love Disney so much, but this movie didn't do anything for me. First off this was one of the strangest casts, I do like John Travolta, but I just couldn't see him as Bolt for some reason, his voice just threw me off completely. Miley Cyrus, this movie became more about her and I think they were just trying to attract her fans to this movie. The only thing that I really did enjoy from Bolt was the hamster, Rhino, he was just absolutely cute, he could have been annoying, but he's like the ultimate fan that loves you so much that it turns around and you like him right back. The animation, it was decent, 3-D is just becoming so huge this year I think. The story is just The Truman Show with a dog, it also kind of reminded me of Homeward Bound, so this is something we've seen before.",2008

I saw some of the production work (final and storyboard) phase of the movie and I could tell already that this movie will touch the hearts of many and especially pet lovers.,2008
9,personally i'am not a fan of animation movies but when i saw this movie i completely fell in love with this movie.,2009
9,"BOLT may not be in the same class as WALL-E but it's still just as entertaining, touching and genuine as any other great animated films that have more than meets the eye. I like watching movies like BOLT because you're bound to not only... have a good time but you'll also get that mushy feeling from its heartfelt story. No matter how tough you think you are, the themes of friendship, family, loyalty will always get you every single time. Definitely a must-see! Especially if you have pets If I were to say anything against BOLT's graphics and animation, it would be like having watched the movie with my eyes closed because the fact remains, the amusing 3D visual effects that this movie treats you with will guarantee the most absolute thrilling, adventurous fun a family can enjoy. They say God is in the details, you'll be hugely impressed at the extent that this movie is willing to go to bring us the most surreal looking dogs or cats or pigeons, just as good, if not better than some of the other CG animated movies I've seen in recent years.",2008
9,"Though my friend who works at a movie theatre had already seen this, he agreed to watch it again with me. This was a thrilling, heartwarming, and funny Disney-computer-animated movie for me. All the voices were great from John Travolta and Miley Cyrus to the rest. This story of a German Shepard who lives a ""Truman Show"" life until he accidentally escapes and meets a cat and a hamster is entertaining from beginning to end. Do yourself and your family a favor and take everyone you know to watch this highly entertaining flick. Not quite Pixar-quality but pretty close. Hope it does even better with the kids out of school this Thanksgiving weekend. So what are you waiting for, just go!",2008
8,"Bolt the dog (voiced by John Travolta) is the star of an espionage television series. His owner, teenager Penny (voiced by Miley Cyrus) is his co-star. On the show, Bolt possesses ""super"" powers and is able to stop trucks with his paws, start explosions with his ""stare"" and outrun the bad guys. However, he lives on the set, in his own trailer, and never leaves the premises, not even to go home for the weekend with Penny. Consequently, he is unaware that he is an ordinary dog but, instead, he truly believes he is a superdog. Therefore, on the day that two pestering cats entice him to leave his trailer, he finds himself out in the ""real"" world. After a mishap, he ends up in a delivery truck to New York City, far away from Hollywood. Still thinking his special skills will get him home pronto, he is in for a rude awakening. But, through the help of a stray cat named Mittens (Susie Essmann) and a hamster named Rhino (Mark Walters), he begins the long cross-country journey. Will he make it? This film was cute and fun, with very nice animation and a clever script. There is a touch of violence, especially at the beginning, for the world of the superhero is rarely without danger, even on a television show. So, perhaps the film is unsuitable for the very youngest viewers. However, the cast is wonderful, with Travolta doing an excellent job as the voice of Bolt. Cyrus, too, is touching in her role as Penny, while Essmann and Walters are really superb additions to the film. All of the lesser characters are voiced very nicely, too, especially Malcolm McDowell as the pipes of the main heavy. The animation is colorful, skillful and very realistic, resulting in an attractive movie. Then, too, the score is quite fine, with Travolta and Cyrus doing a duet near the film's end. All in all, if you care about quality films for families, bolt out the door and arrange a viewing of Bolt. Everyone will be yapping with delight as the film runs its course.",2008
7,"I saw a preview screening of ""Bolt"" just a short while ago. The theater was packed. It turned out to be very funny and enjoyable film. Bolt is a dog that thinks his superpowers are real. He works with his owner, Penny, in a action shown on TV. Bolt runs away when Penny leaves him for the night. He goes all over the place to find her and meets some other animals along the way. The characters in the movie are all very creative and funny, especially the hamster who turns out to be a big fan of Bolt. There is also a character named Mittens (a stray alley cat) that Bolt meets about half way through the movie. This may not be the best animated film you will ever see, but it is still one worth seeing. I would recommend this movie to anyone- not just kids.",2008
9,"I saw this with my dad in a theatre in 2008. As a fan of Neil Marshal, I enjoyed it. His Dog soldiers n The Descent r very good horror films. I found this flick to be a very entertaining n action packed. It was like Mad max on steroids. This movie is a pure adrenaline rush with lots of action and suspense, violence and gore. Its an over-the-top grindhouse epic. A homage to Mad max, Escape from New York, Death race, 28 days later. Awesome visual effects. The pacing is very good. Action n horror fans will not b disappointed. The gore was excellent n top notch. The action is superb, the car chase is excellent with lots of body count n superb camera work n loud music. Mitra is gorgeous, the cinematography is excellent. Pure action n entertainment at its best. Bought a DVD of it recently. Need to revisit. Need to check the hot babe Lee-Anne Liebenberg.",2016
8,"What an insane movie! I saw it in a criminally tiny Saturday afternoon audience (four people) and we all had a terrific time. Don't expect sense, great acting or original dialogue, just go for the kicks and enjoy. A totally deranged, over-the-top splatfest with hideous viral deaths galore, some of the best post-holocaust punk makeup and chase scenes since Road Warrior, brilliant use of 1980's dance music (Adam and the Ants, Frankie Goes to Hollywood--the placement of Siouxie and the Banshees' ""Spellbound"" and a Fine Young Cannibals track at the punk barbecue is simply inspired), a coliseum battle-to-the-death, a bizarre interlude in a Scottish fiefdom that feels as if the movie took a fast detour into the Shire, and the coolest star turn by a UK car since Harry Potter's posse made one fly. All of it snapping and crackling with so much kinetic energy and wild creative freedom that it's hugely exhilarating. We were still giggling like maniacs an hour after the movie.=) It's just such fun to see a director decide to go full-speed over the edge like this. It's not great art, but trust me, if you enjoyed Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome, Planet Terror, Escape from New York/L.A., and/or any recent zombie movie, you can't miss this one.",2008
2,"Now this one is what you see when you look up ""letdown"" in a dictionary. It started out decent, even promising, with a suitably gloomy introduction that, while not exactly what I would call innovative, set the mood very nicely: in the near future, the fatal Reaper virus decimated Scotland and now threatens to makes all human life in the UK a thing of the past. Extreme conditions demand extreme responses, and so the government revives the time-honored British tradition of building humongous barriers across the country. Hadrian's Wall 2.0 is finally finished, the gates are welded shut, the automated sentry guns come online (much to the dismay of the local fauna), what's left of Scotland is sealed off from the rest of the world and everyone is happy. Problem solved, or is it?",2008

1,"Now don't get me wrong. I love bad movies, I really do. I may love them more than good movies. But Doomsday is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. And I didn't like it. Picture this: an Aeon Flux reject from Resident Evil is sent to an area walled off 30 years after a crazy virus kills off thousands of people. Why is she sent? To find the cure of course! Outside of the Wall she finds a whole bunch of cannibalistic gutter punks. Aside from some hilariously bad dialogue, and the cannibals, there are knights (thats right, from Medieval times!), ridiculous stunt driving with lots of explosions, and plenty of walks across the countryside with hobbit-like survivors of the plague, looking like they are trekking to Mordor. I think it was about that time I got a case of the giggles and had to excuse myself. This movie was one of the most gratuitous, ridiculous wastes of time ever! But I did get a bit of a laugh out of it, so maybe I'm being too harsh.",2008
1,"This is, without a doubt, one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is so fantastically bad, I could talk for hours and hours about each and every little atrociously bad element of the movie. I am no stranger to the incredible or the suspension of disbelief required of any sci-fi fan wishing to be entertained. I love outlandish and outrageous things! I cannot, however, abide things which are literally UN-BELIEVABLE, and which conflict with ANY world, fictional or not.",2008
6,"Like Greg Mclean, director of ""Wolf Creek"" and another great white hope for the horror genre, Neil Marshall followed a very promising horror flick with a deliberately trashy project. Where Mclean directed his attention to a murderous crocodile, Marshall took a bow to two of his favorite movies, ""Escape From New York"" and ""Mad Max"". ""Doomsday"" is not just influenced by those two movies, it's practically a mash-up with the female heroine from ""Underworld"" thrown-in. So, the first thing you should forget about when you pop in this movie is originality. Marshall makes no excuses for paying homage to his heroes George Miller and John Carpenter (hell, he even named two characters in this movie after them).",2008

8,"At this point I have already been a fan of writer/director Neil Marshall, as I have already seen Dog Soldiers and The Descent and are among my favorite modern horror films. Doomsday is Neil Marshall's take on the post apocalyptic action/science fiction genre. The film is mostly a combination of 28 Days Later, Escape From New York and The Road Warrior. The film brings us back to the good ole' days(the 80's) and is a highly entertaining and blood soaked action fest that I thoroughly enjoyed from start to finish. The flick is a little campy, but looks great and favors practical f/x and delivers huge with tons of great gory action. Rhona Mitra is our gorgeous lead and is very effective here as a female equivalent to Snake Pliskin. She does well in the fights and gives a very good performance here as the lead in this film. Bob Hoskins and Malcolm McDowell appear as well and are awesome as well. While there is a whole lot of stuff made that just does'nt appeal to me, Doomsday is totally the type of movie that at least, I want to see. I am sure this won't be the sort of film that gets awards, but it gets a thumbs up from me and is awesome in my book.",2016
1,"I loved Dog Soldiers, enjoyed Descent and thought Doomsday was not even a film. Absolutely nothing of merit. I thought I was watching a bored run-through of the script by stand-ins. The script is uninspired. The plot is flawed so many times as to render futile all attempts to believe. Not worthy of being mentioned on the same page as Escape From New York, Mad Max et al. PS I suspect it was filmed on the cheap in Glasgow on a Friday night; this thought was the only thing I enjoyed during this miserable film. (The guidelines say I need at least 10 lines of text, hence this line. I have no desire to waste more of my life on this film but I do want to warn others.)",2008
1,"Well where do i begin? i am not some intellectual who only enjoys grainy B/W french films about poets...nor am i some miserable fim critic who no longer enjoys the taste of life.........i AM a child of the 80's movie! i know more things about Conan, John Matrix, Dutch, Frank Dux, jack Burton and ALL the damn goonies than i do about my own girlfriend! so in theory i should have loved this film...but i hated it! firstly i do not like the work of this director. i hated dog soldiers, i spent 7 years in the infantry and was still in the army at the time...and soldiers ARE NOTHING like that! admittedly i thought the decent was semi-interesting although the cast was barely believable and acted as if they were the contestants on some reality show (""Hey there is camera...look at me everyone IM acting!""). so in summary i am amazed that this man was entrusted with such a vast sum of cash for this doomsday project! and after i suffered sitting through it i did enjoy the fact that it failed at the box office...because it barely deserved to make it to the big screen at all.",2008

3,"I certainly didn't rent this movie expecting anything good, just something mildly entertaining. What I received was slightly less than entertaining. In this Mad Max wannabe film, mohawked road-warriors have simply been replaced with slightly more stylish, punk-looking freaks with equally overdone mohawks, copious piercings and unrealistically flawless tattoos. How these people got ahold of all the tattoo guns and yet have no actual firearms is beyond me. How these club-swinging, Molotov-throwing ruffians are somehow starving and forced to subsist on human flesh yet the protagonists drive through a herd of cattle prior to entering post-apocalyptic Glasgow is also beyond my comprehension.",2008
5,"Stunning Rhona Mitra is the only saving grace of the dreadful ""Doomsday"". Even her charismatic presence and black skin tight couture can not salvage this narrative quagmire from Director and Writer Neil Marshall. Marshall was actually very effective in ""The Descent"". That makes what happened here even more bewildering. ""Doomsday"" is a mutated clone on a number of levels. Beautiful Rhona Mitra resembles Kate Beckinsale of ""Underworld"", but is a more athletic version. The comparisons to ""Underworld"" are warranted-- in particular the Gothic nihilistic tone. No Vampires. Instead we have cannibalistic survivors of a deadly man-made virus. The ""Doomsday"" post apocalyptic world of 2033 lands as a cheap rip-off of ""The Road Warrior"" and ""Mad Max: Beyond Thunder Dome"". At times enduring the grotesque cinematic chaos becomes insufferable. There is a protracted scene in which one of Major Sinclair's (Mitra's) men is charred crispy and then consumed. ""Doomsday"" begins with a promising premise, but soon spirals out of control into the narrative abyss. This is too bad, because Mitra plays a great hero and Malcolm McDowell garners enough restraint as the compelling antagonist Kane.",2008
1,"I just love the end of the world. Whether it's Day Of The Triffids, War Of The Worlds, The Stand, 28 Days Later or any number of other books or movies, there's some vicious little child in me that takes great joy in seeing the whole of civilization smashed into little bitty pieces. So when I heard that Neil Marshall, the director of the great Dog Soldiers, was making an end-of-the-world movie, my sadistic little heart leapt for joy. This was going to be good. This was going to be one of the movies of the year.",2010

6,"I'm a big science fiction fan, and was very intrigued by the idea for ""Jumper"". Samuel L. Jackson always lends credibility and I was interested to see Hayden Christensen for the first time since Star Wars ( I haven't seen ""Awake"" yet). I persuaded a friend to come with me based on the special effects in the trailer. ",2008
7,"I saw this film last night, and i must say i was pleasantly surprised, I have been reading lots of comments on IMDb to get an idea of what to expect, lots of people were negative about the acting performance of Hayden Christensen, well i don't agree, I think he handled the character in an interesting fashion, considering his character left home at the age of 16 or so, raised himself and used his abilities to support himself in a wild and fun manner. So he is not your average run of the mill kid, nobody knows what he can do and he can basically do and go where he wants, creating an aloof type of character, so under these circumstance i think his performance was okay, maybe not worthy of an academy award but totally interesting to watch, I enjoyed his intensity. Overall i thought it was a great film for what it was, special effects are great, and the story holds together in most aspects. The concept of Jumping is something we have all thought about at one time or another, just like time travel. I think that a lot of people who comment on IMDb have no idea of what goes into making a movie, but just like to be critical as possible. When i go to the movies i want to be entertained, this movie certainly did that!! Check it out and don't forget the popcorn!!!",2008

7,"For some reason, somewhere/when/one in Hollywood decided that 90 minutes was the optimal length a movie should be. Even in superlative films like LOTR and The GodFathers, there are always people bitching about it being too long. This is an issue that drives me nuts because JUMPER really needed another half hour or so to provide exposition, and answer questions that remain unanswered due to this inane 90 minute time limit. All in all, an interesting plot, decent acting, cool locations, very thin in development. Realistically, this is a film for those of us who can shut off expectations and simply enjoy some widely improbable events. An art-house film it is not, nor does it try to be, to its credit. I would really like to see a sequel to this film, as the storyline has been established, and I seriously doubt my semi-Rant about movie lengths will change anything. ",2008
7,For all haters.,2008
5,"Jumper was entertaining, but it was difficult to make myself care about any of the characters. There's no development, so you really don't understand the motives of either the bad guys or the good guys. And what really bothered me was that the ""good guy"" is completely hedonistic. He doesn't use his powers to help people (the best scene in the movie was when he disinterestedly walks away from a television news report about people in drowning in a flood); he just travels the world and robs banks. At times, he even endangers the public by using his powers irresponsibly. Although this could have been an interesting take on the superhero story, the film doesn't do enough to turn it into that; the writers hardly seem to realize just how self-involved the hero is. It was almost enough to make me pull for Samuel L. Jackson's character if only he hadn't been so one-dimensional. Although I was entertained for the duration of the film, it left me feeling cold.",2008
6,"To sum it up quickly: Too much setup. This entire film should have been the first half-hour of a bigger story. They try to make this just a first chapter, like an ""origin"" story in a superhero film, but if you're gonna spend the whole film setting up a story, and leave an ending wide open for sequels, you better be damn sure the public will actually care enough to see more. I don't think that will be the case here. Perhaps if it had been filmed and marketed as a teen flick as the book was, the series could have a longer life; but as an adult franchise I'd be surprised if there are further installments.",2008
1,Let me start by saying that I like action movies. Sci-fi ones? Even better. The Fifth Element. Aliens. 300. All excellent.,2008

7,"Firstly, let me explain why the score for the movie is so low. The hype before it came out made all the critics Jump up and down and had all of them excited and looking forward to a amazing stunning sci-fi action. But obviously that's wrong, the movie was not Amazing, but it was very entertaining very unique and different, a tightly made film. I also agree it could have been a lot better but you can't change that now, but saying all that it's still a very good movie. Here's why.",2009
7,"The idea of ""jumping"" is really neat and the movie creatively and thoroughly explored the possibilities given the premise. Besides the incredible effects, you have to see this in the theaters because of the amazing landscapes and city scenes. From the Colosseum in Rome, to the pyramids in Egypt, if you love to travel, this movie will take you all over the world.",2008
1,"I don't normally ever write reviews for movies, (usually I am content with allowing others to draw their own personal opinions) but after witnessing this train wreck of a movie I felt strongly compelled to warn someoneanyone out there about this...this *insert loathsome adjective here* disaster of a movie.",2008
1,"The film is so awful - I don't know where to start... First of all, Hayden Christensen and Rachel Bilson are such terrible actors: looking good in nice clothes doesn't make you an actor but Hollywood begs to differ I guess! It is just painful to watch these two moving around: Christensen with an emotionless ""I-am-so-cool"" face and Bilson acting like a 5-year old girlie at a Nativity play!! What makes them look even worse is the presence of talented actors like Samuel L. Jackson and the less famous Jamie Bell. Diane Lane is totally underused here and seems to be kind of embarrassed by her mini-role... But even if they had cast better actors for the lead roles, it wouldn't have saved the film simply because the script is astonishingly bad. It is not following any internal logic and plausibility: guy suddenly discovers his supernatural powers when he is 15 although his mother knew about them since he was 5 (?!?), then decides to rob banks which don't seem to have any surveillance cameras and just leaves his father behind not caring about him anymore. What he cares about is living a shallow and materialistic life in his penthouse, ""jumping"" around postcard locations, screwing horny chicks in Britain after watching people drown on the TV news etc. The script does not even try to imply that this is wrong - Christensen's character is portrayed as the main protagonist i.e. the ""good guy"" and all these actions and behaviour as being just a normal part of his life! The twisted message to all the adolescent viewers is that it's quite cool to steal money from banks as long as you don't get caught and then live it up - it is as simple as that! Our hero shows of course no remorse for his actions whatsoever: even the slightest concept of guilt, responsibility and conscience would have been beyond the scope of this tripe. The final redeeming quality of his character is supposed to be the fact that he did not kill the ""villain"" but left him stuck in the middle of nowhere instead?!? Wow, how noble and imaginative... ",2008
1,"It's too bad that a law is not passed in the United States allowing you to get a full ticket refund if you walk out of the theater after watching 50% or less of a movie. A bell could ring or light could flash for a second to remind the patrons of a last call for a refund! If a system like this was in place in the United States, I guarantee you - rotten, boring trash like Jumper would never, ever be made! Half the theater would have emptied out in a heartbeat! This film is so incredibly vapid and mind-numbingly dull it genuinely insults the intelligence of the movie going audience!!",2008
10,"I liked this movie. This is exactly the kind of thing I'd expect from a teen who's mother abandoned him at age 5 and who's father seemed an alcoholic abuser. He doesn't know much about good emotion, he just goes out and takes what he needs. He didn't have a solid upbringing so it stands to reason he'd not care what he did as long as he got what he wanted.",2010

A person who suddenly found out he had the power to teleport or 'jump' in this context when he was trapped in the water under ice. It is a very interesting story to me. Not surprising though, as David Goyer (writer of Man of Steel, and the Dark Knight Trilogy, and more) was one-third of its screenplay writers.",2013

Anyways, if you are a Hayden Christensen fan, by all means go. He wears a variety of ill-fitting clothes that perverted teenage girls will fully enjoy watching. (Creepy teenage boys will also like Rachel Bilson, because she's in it too.) Hmmm... Other good things... Oh, yeah! There was a pretty snow globe in it... some greats scenes for those who frequently say, ""ooh shiny!"" And... Hayden looks cool in that scene with the clock tower. It's sort of a cross between V for Vendetta and Mary Poppins.",2008
5,"Wasn't really expecting much from the hideous reviews and the fact that Hayden Christensen really can't act. However, was quite good I thought, but thats mainly due to the fact that it was pretty short meaning it was a pacey action movie with terrible dialogue.",2008
6,"In Ann Arbor, the teenager David Rice was left by his mother when he was five year-old; he does not have a good relationship with his father; and he has a crush on his schoolmate Millie Harris. When David gives a snow globe with the Eiffel Tower to Millie, the bully Mark Kobold throws it onto a frozen river. David tries to retrieve the object, but the ice shatters and David fall under the ice. Suddenly he teleports himself to a library and discovers that he has the ability to jump anywhere he wants. He decides to run away home, moving to New York, and uses his power to rob a bank vault. Eight years later, David (Hayden Christensen) is living in a fancy apartment in New York and having a life full of adventure, traveling to the most exotic places in the world. He decides to visit Millie (Rachel Bilson) in Ann Arbor and invites her to visit Rome. While in the Coliseum, David meets the jumper Griffin (Jamie Bell) that explains to him that the dangerous Roland Cox (Samuel L. Jackson) and his team of Paladins are chasing him and his family and friends are in danger.",2008
7,"I liked this movie for its cool special effects and action scenes. I was always a fan of teleportation and so far this is the only movie to make it its running theme. I'll admit that Hayden Christensen is very nice to look at but not the best of actors around to hold this type of movie. I wanted to like the character David Rice but found myself not caring for him at all. His selfish actions were horrible (robbing banks, not using his ability to save drowning victims). He is no hero and I'm not sure if the point was to make him un-likable. I enjoyed the scenes with Griffin and agree with many here who say he stole the screen every time he appeared. My favorite was the fight with Roland and that highly mentioned car racing scene in Hong Kong. This is the first time seeing Sam L. Jackson in a flat out villainous role. He does it well. I won't be watching it again for the faulty plot but so far it's the most interesting movie in the theater.",2008
5,"Pretty cute movie, pretty standard romcom premise, and Judy Greer is worth a watch any time. Katherine Heigel is likable, Judy Greer smart and funny, and James Marsden is charming, and everyone else serviceable. But the sloppy story-telling and needless gimmickry took away a lot of the fun. The story of the dresses was pretty amusing.",2008
8,"For many the plot of this movie feels formulaic and revisited. Jane (Katherine Heigl) is the people-pleaser of the century. A somewhat spineless nice girl who can't say no to anyone, she has been a bridesmaid 27 times, often exceeding her duties in every wedding. For all her romantic yearnings, she can't seem to hook her boss, George (Ed Burns) whom she has been in love with for years. When her self-centered little sister Tess (Malin Akerman) comes in and manages to snag George, Jane once again capitulates to everyone's needs but her own. In comes Kevin (James Marsden), a newspaper columnist stuck covering weddings who yearns to break out and write about more important things. Under the pretense of covering George and Tess's wedding, he really is writing about Jane and her perpetual bridesmaid stints. Complications ensue etc. etc.",2008
2,"I didn't expect this movie to be thus thoroughly lacking in intellect. Katherine Heigl's character, Jane was meant to be portrayed as a witty and smart, warm-hearted girl-next-door type as opposed to her sister Tess, the hot but dumb blond. Sadly, both of them came across to me as just plain dumb, completely lacking the ability to construct a good sentence. The relationship between the sisters I thought mostly seemed to be ripped off(and not very well might I add) from the Rose(Toni Collette)-Maggie(Cameron Diaz) relationship in 'In Her Shoes'. Edward Burns's character, perhaps deliberately was so passive it made me wonder why anybody would fall for him. Heigl's acting is mostly good barring a few scenes in which she has the look of a person just recovered from a coma and her expressions are left to the audience's imagination. The dialog is ridiculous in parts but a few well written witticisms save the day(well, almost). Highly unrealistic at times, the writers have also contradicted themselves several times with displays of absurd anomalies in the behavior of some of the characters. And may I also say, that the word ""cynical"" has been used far more than necessary and quite often in the wrong context even. The only redemption factor in the movie is probably James Marsden. His acting is pretty good if not great and his character seems to be the only smart one in the entire movie, other than Jane's best friend Casie(played by Judy Greer) who was personally my favorite character and the only one with any substance. The story in itself is highly clichéd, the typical naive pushover falls in love with the incidentally highly handsome young lad who helps her through the struggle of learning to put her foot down. Too predictable. I'd have liked to watch a romantic comedy that isn't mindless and whose numerous shortcomings I'm not supposed to overlook just so i can enjoy that oh-so-heart-warming moment. Romance shouldn't need to be brainless, and its audience shouldn't be thus underestimated. Overall, I'd give the movie a 2 on 10.",2008
2,"So I was unlucky enough to catch this mess while on a 13-hour flight from Shanghai to Chicago, along with Fool's Gold and Jumper. Remind me never to fly United again. After the first hour I was ready to throw myself out of the plane somewhere over the Arctic circle. I'm not sure where exactly we were at that moment, but I looked out the window and the ocean below was frozen, and landing on top of the ice after a 35,000-foot freefall sounded more appealing than another 45 minutes of this tripe.",2008
7,"Although this movie is a bit typical, it's still a breezy, light hearted romp, which is all it appears to be trying to do. It's got formulaic construction familiar in romantic comedies, yet it knows it's just harmless fluff and doesn't try to be anything more.",2008
2,"When I saw the trailer for 27 Dresses, I was like ""Oh, my God, not again"", typical plot, chick flick written all over it with over cheesy dialog and unrealistic situations that sadly I can completely predict. But thanks to the wonderful users of IMDb who gave this movie great reviews. My friend begged me to go see this with her, so I figured since she was treating and it was getting good reviews, it might be worth a look, so we saw it today, and I think my friend hates me, because I told her what would happen in the next scene and it would happen. This romantic comedy genre, doesn't anyone realize that these stupid plots are just recycled from one romantic comedy to the next?! The only thing they do is a ""twist"", a wedding planner, a hotel maid, a treasure hunter, blah, blah, blah. The actors couldn't even save this film.",2008
9,"I wasn't expecting much from this movie. I went to see it with a bunch of girlfriends not really thinking it would be anymore then your usual rom-com but I was very pleasantly surprised! Right from the start I could tell it would be something more than I had thought because the opening scenes had me laughing so hard -and thats saying something, because it takes a lot to make me laugh. The script was clever and witty and although sometimes certain aspects were predictable, you were always very engaged in the story and the characters. The acting was solid the entire film, I was already a huge fan of Katherine Heigl but after watching this and 'Enchanted' I am now also in love with James Marsden! The atmosphere in the cinema when i saw this movie was great, you could tell everyone was enjoying themselves.

I just felt like I had seen this film before somewhere (or parts of it in different films). I guess I watched it because I'm getting married soon so I wanted to see the dresses in the film (and there are some amazing ones and some interesting ones for those who care about dresses). The audience didn't seem to laugh as much as I thought they would. This is not the same kind of film as Knocked Up and maybe people were expecting that.

This time, she sets off to find her own Mr. Right. The story is predictable and a little bit cheesy. It has some nice moments of humor and good drama too. The cast is good, Katherine Heigl was good and James Marsden gives a decent performance, Malin Akerman was OK, I feel her a little overact and Judy Greer maybe she was the best with a role full of irony. One of the good things of the movie is the various landscapes from New York City and the soundtrack is also good In conclusion this is a 100% chick flick, women will love it, men avoid it",2008

You know, in Friends the fake Monica said that she was so disgusted with Dead Poet Society that it changed her life because she will never have that wasted time back. Well I feel exactly the same about this movie. It's not funny, it's not romantic it's not smart, it is boring and it is frustrating. Why would they call it a romantic comedy? It doesn't make sense.

That being said, I actually liked some chick-flicks (to watch with my fianceé that is) such as How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, Hitch, etc. But this movie is, as the title states, a groan-inducing, cliché filled estrogen fest. Granted, Katherine Heigl is a talented, very beautiful woman, but her looks are about the only thing I really enjoyed in this movie.",2008
4,"The romantic comedy, ""27 Dresses,"" is a skimpy ""always a bridesmaid, never a bride"" tagline stretched out to a one-hour-and-fifty-minute-long feature film. The lovely Katherine Heigl, of ""Knocked Up"" fame, plays Jane Nichols, a wedding consultant who has dedicated her life to turning other women's dreams into matrimonial reality - though she has yet to make that fateful trip to the altar herself. Complications arise when she meets a scruffy, jeans-and-t-shirt-wearing journalist who also just happens to be a die-hard cynic about marriage (he considers it the ""last legal form of slavery"") and who, for reasons not related to either logic or credibility, has been assigned to the wedding beat of a popular Manhattan newspaper. It's hate-at-first-sight for Jane, of course, made worse when the young man pens what amounts to a style-section hit piece on Jane and her soon-to-be-wed sister, Tess. Eventually, however, after all the plot conniptions have been neatly sorted out, Jane comes to her senses and realizes that here, indeed, is that very man of her dreams she's been pining away for all these years.",2008

Instead, what I got was goosebumps, a funny feeling in my stomach, and almost a teensy-weensy tear in my eye, for this film is one of the worst films I have seen in many years. Everything about it, from the script, the dialogs, the characters, the acting... I can best describe this film with the words ""pretentious, over the top, silly (and NOT in a good way), boring, downright stupid..."" *sigh*... I only watched this incredibly awful movie to the end, to... well... I don't really know... it was not because I wanted to make sure the ending would be EXACTLY like I knew it was going to be, because there was no doubt about that... it was more like watching a train wreck... you want to look away, but yet somehow, you just ... can't... stop... looking...

Every possible cliché you can imagine is depicted in this movie. The female protagonist is as charming as an ice cube. I kept watching hoping it would get better and that I would not be so good at guessing. But I won every time. Trust me. Avoid it.

4,"I saw this movie on demand with friends (me, other guy, two girls) yesterday. He, the host, got pressured into watching it. All you need to know is that, in this ~2 hr. movie, the first hour and a half or so is just people being sad because nothing works out for them. The opening scene has the main character, Jane, a spineless doormat, running from one wedding to another. Honestly now, who in real life has little enough will to say no to one friend because she just can't be there and she has already made a commitment to another friend? The movie follows Jane as nothing goes her way: her sister falls in love with her boss, some random New York Journal writer puts her on the front page in a totally ""OMG"" humiliating article. Then, in the final twenty minutes, everything turns out well because... I don't really know how, it just... did. The final nail in the coffin was the ending, where (Spoilers...) Jane gets married, and has 27 bridesmaids, each wearing one of her titular 27 dresses...",2008
4,"I'll start out and say that the movie had its cute moments, especially when Jane was trying on all 27 dresses for Kevin, and the typical line of how the bride's maid can always shorten the dress and wear it again (old joke), but overall this was just one more in a long series of predictable and boring movies that ""Hollywood"" sends out, like on some assembly line, using the same formula or template. It's getting to the point that these movies are interchangeable and the only difference is who is starring in it and sometimes where it takes place. If you want to be able to watch something fairly entertaining and not use up too many brain cells, this is the perfect movie. In Special Features (on the DVD) is a short about The Running of the Brides at Filene's, and this little segment had more going on than the entire movie. What is distressing is when the audience can tell, almost to the minute, when the hero, or heroine, will screw up, and then there's the running to catch the man, or woman, of your dreams at the end. Do people really dash to airports or piers? Can't they wait an hour or 2? What was cute in the movie, When Harry Met Sally (his speech to her) about when you figure out you want to spend the rest of your life with that person so want it to start ASAP, so that explains dashing through the streets to catch up to the person, has been grossly overused.",2008
8,"Regardless of how faithful The Spiderwick Chronicles movie is to the original stories by Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black, the film is tremendously entertaining and thankfully resolute. Unlike the recent flock of fantasy epics including The Golden Compass and The Seeker, which conclude feeling wholly unsatisfactory due to an abrupt resolution that suggests further films in the series, The Spiderwick Chronicles easily stands alone as a complete story. With sensationally mirthful creature designs and likable human characters, topped with state-of-the-art special effects, The Spiderwick Chronicles is another big win for Paramount and a high bar for family films of 2008.",2008
7,"I work at IMAX theaters, and we showed an advanced staff screening tonight. Having been surrounded by posters and trailers for Spiderwick Chronicles for months, I was already sick of the film before I even saw it. But I went into it with an open mind, and found myself pleasantly surprised. The plot centers around a broken family that moves into an old house that has been in the family for years, in hopes of ""starting over"". Freddie Highmore plays two roles, twin brothers Jarod and Simon, and does an impressive job at keeping the two personalities distinct and different. Jarod, the angsty protagonist of the film, discovers a book (titled, the Spiderwick Chronicles) written by his late great uncle depicting in explicit detail the creatures of a ""hidden world"" all around us. Jarod reads the book, and in the process awakens an evil Ogre and a horde of goblins hell bent on obtaining the knowledge hidden within the book to destroy mankind, and creature-kind as well. The pacing is decent, and the acting works well within the context of the film. Oddly, it's the adult actors that deliver the lamest lines, as they seem profoundly out of place in this otherwise fantasy and child actor filled film. The CGI effects were well implemented too, with various characters and creatures popping up here and there to provide comedic relief, and often, pivitol plot development. The various supporting characters do a great job of keeping things moving, most notable being Jarod and Simons sister, Mallory, played by Sarah Bolger, who delivers a great performance. Having never read the books, I can't make any comparisons, but what I saw in the film I liked quite a bit. Not the most complex of movies, and there are some glaring plot holes here and there, but overall, it holds up pretty well, albeit some wonky script writing here and there.",2008
8,"The Spiderwick Chronicles is based upon the books of the same name by Tony DeTerlizzi and Holly Black. The film centers around a mother and her three children who move into a mysterious and creepy new house pretty much in the middle of nowhere. The one son Jared who is the main character in the film, finds a book written by the previous owner of the house and Jared soon discovers that this is a magical yet very dangerous book that a lot of goblins and little creatures are after, but with the help of his twin brother, his older sister and some friendly creatures he gets the book to safety and also protects himself and his family from the evil monsters that want the book to do harm. Ever since The Lord Of The Rings and Harry Potter films have done so well, filmmakers are taking other fantasy books and turning them into feature films as well. The majority of them that have been released over the past few years I have not seen because for one thing they did not look appealing to me at all and also because of bad word of mouth and reviews. I wasn't sure what I would think of The Spiderwick Chronicles, but to my surprise I thought it was pretty good. The film is aimed at a family audience even though some young children might be afraid of some scenes, but this is a film that I think kids will absolutely love and there is enough here for the grownups as well. The story sounds simple enough, but it is enhanced by a lot of creative creatures and imaginative things going on. The young cast each did their own and carried the film and even though I don't usually like computer generated effects in films, I didn't feel it was overdone here just for the sake of showing what today's new wonderful technology can do and I really appreciated that the film didn't go overboard with that. The running time moves along fairly briskly and the film is involving and interesting from the start and keeps it's energy and charm throughout the running time. There were a few repeated story patterns and clichés in the script, but there were also a lot of surprises and new takes on things, so that can be forgiven. When looking at a film like this at a child you would like the magic, imagination and the story that is woven in front of you with interesting characters, environments and a grand sense of storytelling that can make the make believe into a fun and entertaining film. This is all captured very well here and works as a fairy tale for kids 8 to whatever age. A creative enough story helped by good film-making and an eye for what kids and adults love about these movies make this film a generally good and above average family fantasy film of the past few years.",2008
7,"Although The Spiderwick Chronicles did fall short in comparison to other films in the same genre, it did offer some fun entertainment for the entire family.",2008
10,Went to a UK preview tonight and this completely took me by surprise. A brilliant fantasy adventure which retains it's dignity and doesn't sell out for a cute Disney style box office attack.,2008
8,I truly wasn't expecting much from this movie goon in but it was the only family movie available to watch with my 5 and 3 year old. I figured that because it wasn't a cartoon I'd have to deal with squirming bottoms and talking. But to my amazement the movie was not only entertaining to both of my boys (NO SQUIRMING!!!) both my husband and I loved it. My husband wouldn't even get a refill on the popcorn----and believe me that doesn't happen often!!!! I have nothing negative to say about the film. Some might think it's a little too scarry for younger kids but neither one of mine were scarred. A couple of times I had to explain some things to my 5 year old. The head goblin is kind of scarry looking; but not too bad.,2008
10,"This is being compared to Harry Potter? That is completely ridiculous. Some idiotic critics are saying ""This movie isn't like Harry Potter, therefore, it's terrible"" This movie is an amazing example of a fantasy movie, and one that doesn't cut much out, unlike Harry Potter. This movie has great acting, especially by the dual-part playing Freddie Highmore, who loses his British accent quite convincingly. Also, Sarah Bolger and Mary-Louise Parker do superb jobs with their acting considering it's mostly a four-person cast. (Excluding voice overs) The special effects alone are amazing. If you don't like this movie, you have to admit, the special effects were amazing. If there were a sequel, I would most definitely see it as long as it has the same actors, special effects team, and director.",2008
10,"Don't listen to all those 'know it alls' who say the book is better then the movie, so therefore, this movie isn't any good. This was a GREAT movie! Obviously you can't fit a whole book into a kid length movie - so they do the best they can and this was WILDLY successful! It was a fun, suspenseful movie that engages you from the beginning. I went with my 9 year old daughter and she LOVED IT! I haven't seen such a good children's movie in a long, long time! It's a MUST SEE! If your child is easily scared then this may not be the movie for them. While I don't view it as a scary movie - the goblins and action might be startling for sensitive kids.",2008

8,"This is another of those fantasy films that serves its purpose in that it entertains, no matter what the age. It's not among the elite in its genre, but it is a story that hooks you in by the 20-minute mark and you just go along for the ride, mainly to see how things will turn out.",2008
10,"A movie that will definitely plunge the audience young and old - into plenty of film-watching fun with its strange and fantastical mysteries, challenges, unpredictable chills and thrills. Examine the Spiderwick Estate with its crumbling mansion that the three Grace children and their mother must now consider as 'home'. Yep, a mansion that seems more like a haunted house whispering to be explored, and one where invisible eyes seems to watch or stalk at every corner. Yet, there's more these family members must need to confront than just a spooky home. The film's introduction to David Stratham's Arthur does give subtle hints of the horrifying events to come, but only its ending will eventually expose the dark secrets, not only of their family heritage, but of the family's burden. Yep this film does have abundance of twists and turns to keep the audience emotionally glued to the screen.",2008
3,"First, I'm surprised that most negative reviews (<5 rating) are only from viewers that know the books (or at least one), cause the movie is not good for itself. IMHO one of the biggest mistakes are the characters of the kids. I don't know the book but I can't imagine the children were introduced like this in the original in terms of character development. Whiny, hateful, aggressive, etc... and NO, the breakup of their parents doesn't explain it at all. At least not at this intensity.",2013
8,"I really have waited to be one of those guys who say ""I saw this movie at a sneak preview"" as we don't get them very often in Nashville but on this nice Saturday, I was very much into the story as a 27 year old male but I am a constant watcher of films. I would probably put it more in the 13 and under range-it wasn't very scary but did have a few frights in it. The magical creatures were nowhere near to the fear factor as ""Lord of the Rings"" but a little more so than the ones from ""The Chronicles of Narnia"".",2008
4,"Other than the names of the characters and the house, this bore almost no resemblance to the books. Compressing 5 books totaling almost 600 (sparse) pages into 95 minutes IS a challenge, but this ""adaptation"" sucked the soul from the series and turned it into a mini-horror movie for kids.",2014
5,"First, the good parts. Amazing special effects, of course. They double cast Freddie Highmore flawlessly, so much that people who didn't know it were shocked. Additionally, my kids read the books and said it was an impressive adaptation of all five (!) of the books. Having not read them myself, the movie still felt coherent without missing any parts.",2008
8,"Spiderwick does not quite have the same ""meatiness"" and joy for adults that the recent ""The Golden Compass"" possessed. Nonethlesless, it was a pleasant evening at the cinema, after a long work week at the uni. I suspect that 'Tweeners and mid-teen types will find it just about their level, and perhaps some mature-ish children will find it thrilling and a rousing adventure.",2008
2,"The Spiderwick Chronicles (2008): Dir: Mark Waters / Cast: Freddie Highmore, Mary Louise Parker, Sarah Bolger, David Strathairn, Andrew McCarhty: This is one of the most idiotic big budget movies since Wild Wild West. The plot has all the excitement of burnt toast. A family moves into a big house where a magical book is discovered by a boy, played by Freddie Highmore. It was written by his great uncle and can unleash evil creatures. That sounds like a great thing to leave for one's family. Why not just leave them a very large check and save them the headache. Director Mark Waters does his best but he really should go back to what worked for him. Mean Girls worked as one of the best of teen flicks that its target audience can relate to. With Spiderwick Chronicles he revisits the stupidity of Head Over Heels and that is a major scale backwards. This film has a whole family of morons. When told not to take the book outside the house, Highmore does so not once, but twice. That's a prime example of a kid who uses no common sense. Mary Louise Parker has the thankless role of mother-who-doesn't-listen-to-kids-and-yells-a-lot role. Sarah Bolger is given the embarrassing role of sword fighter sister. Finally there is David Strathairn as the senile uncle who comes off as if he walked onto the wrong film set. Despite fine visual elements, this film should be destroyed alongside the book. Score: 2 / 10",2015
4,"1st watched 6/4/2009 – 4 out of 10 (Dir – Mark Waters): Scary supposed children's fantasy film was really pretty much a horror flick with fantasy characters thrown in. A real disappointment, in my opinion, because they focused on the kids in terror aspect instead of allowing us to understand the fantasy world a little bit better instead of jolting us for 90 minutes. The basic storyline revolves around a troubled family that movie into an old house and find a book that is(guess what) not supposed to be opened!! And, of course, one of the Freddie Highmore characters( he plays a dual role of American speaking twins) opens it and all hell breaks loose in the fantasy world. The book was written by a man named Spiderwick 80 years earlier and tells of the unseen world and all of it's secrets. An evil character wants the book and a protective character, voiced by Martin Short, tries to explain the scenario to the child. The rest of the movie, the kids are pursued by the evil forces and their goal is to not be killed by it and kill it, of course. Sounds like a horror movie, doesn't it?? Anyway, the last 15 minutes are good but getting there is not fun. This movie was based on a series of books but I find it hard to believe that the series boiled down to this action piece. In my opinion, this was Hollywood's attempt to make it marketable and it doesn't work. Too bad, because I'm sure this movie disappointed many adults and the kids they brought in to see it.",2009

9,"Our family of 4 went to see this tonight, and loved it! Not too scary for our 6 year old son, and interesting enough for our 12 year old daughter and for us (37 and 39.) Great plot & storyline. Special effects were not too cheesy--and easy enough to fall into believing. It was the perfect length; we were mesmerized yet it didn't finish to fast. Definitely worth the $30 for tickets and $20 for snacks. And I am sure we will eventually purchase the DVD when it comes out. This is a great Part 1, hope that Part 2 is as entertaining! This was a wonderful fantasy-- loved the 'pet' and the great aunt and too many things to list!",2008

IT seems Seven Pounds is getting a lot of negative press and I felt like I need to do my part to let some people know that this movie is SIMPLY BEAUTIFUL! For me, this was a rare movie that stays with you. I found everything about this movie beautiful..the acting, the music, the directing and especially the beautiful story. A story of giving..sacrifice with purpose. I am not the biggest Will Smith fan, but I must say that his performance for me was ASTOUNDING. I felt his pain and was moved by what his character was doing. This is not a easy story to tell in 2hrs and I think they did a really fantastic job. This movie will not be for everyone...it moves slowly and may be confusing..until you figure it out...then the reality of his purpose will crush you emotionally and at the same time it is so beautiful....SWEET PAIN (it did for me anyway)....Seven Pounds is a wonderful movie that will stay with you long into the night and next day.....Thanks",2008
10,"I don't give out 10 stars easily unless it's a film that can keep me guessing. A film that will make me want to see it through to the end, not because I paid hard earned cash, but because I truly care about the characters and where they're going to end up. If you like me, then you're going to want to see this one.",2008

10,"If this film doesn't get nominated for an Academy Award, there is no justice. It was an astonishingly good film. The storyline unfolds piece by piece and keeps you guessing until the end, trying to figure out who this character is and what he's up to. The juxtaposition of such a dynamically humanitarian man being an IRS auditor is the first thing that piques your interest and the mystery grows from there. In order to be an excellent film, you need a good story, good screenplay, and good acting. Seven pounds has all that and more. The story was upheld by outstanding performances by Will Smith, Rosario Dawson and Barry Pepper. It's more than a touching film. It's one of those rare films that actually makes you take stock of your life and reexamine your priorities. Kudo's to all involved.",2008

You will indeed be seen crying on this one. You  will need a box of tissues.  I do not know how or what the so called self critics are seeing, but I  don't think it's the same movie I just finished watching. Yes it's a  little slow, but its real.

We follow him on his mission to seek out seven strangers in desperate need of help. Ben's plans are complicated when he meets and falls in love with Emily (Rosario Dawson), a young woman with a terminal heart condition. Italian director Gabriele Muccino brilliantly pieces together a tragic modern day Shakespearian love story, weaving between the present day and glimpses into the dark past. Seven Pounds is not a kick back and zone out film, you have to work as an audience member to put all the pieces together. The more you allow your mind to work in this film, the more you will get out of it.",2008
7,"Seven Pounds, this was the movie where I was just convinced Will Smith is really going for the ""I'm going to make you cry"" films. One thing I can give him a ton of credit for, the man can cry. My only thing is, as moving as the story is, Will Smith has proved time and time again that he can act, so why is he taking this extremely depressing story? But nevertheless it's still a good movie. I do have to admit it made me cry, but I felt that the stand out performance was Rosario Dawson, I absolutely love this girl, ever since I saw her in 25th Hour with Ed Norton, I knew this girl was going to go far. She's beautiful, charming, funny and talented, can't wait to see how much further her career is going to go. But her and Will Smith, not so sure if they had the great chemistry that the film needed that would've made this into a great film.",2009

Yes it is slow, yes it gets a little boring, but whilst your watching the movie your always taking in the story line and my does the movie make up for it in the last 30 minutes when the jigsaw is put together and the full plot is revealed. I think this movie is actually better than The Pursuit Of Happiness which most will know was also a very good film. Will Smith, Rosario Dawson, Woody Harrelson, Michael Ealy and Barry Pepper all deserve awards with there 10 out of 10 performances. This movie for me is a must see, i am still actually getting over the film as it quite simply blew me away.",2008

10,"It baffles me how anybody can say a bad word about this film; the standard of acting... the mysterious, highly intelligent and gripping storyline... the amazingly thought-out scene sequence... the tearful scriptwriting... it all combines to make this film a definite 10/10. I have always liked films with a twist or two, I like a film to be unpredictable and trigger some emotions. Well, this film certainly did that. First of all, the cast members are all clearly highly trained and the best at what they do. Will Smith has always intrigued me as an actor, with his versatile acting ability. However, in my opinion, this film is far beyond what he has shown us before. There was no second-hand casting, as every person does an amazing job throughout the film, which is necessary for the heart-wrenching script/story. If the actors were not up to scratch, I dread to think what the outcome of Seven Pounds would have been like. The story is unexplainable, and I don't want to give anything away but the quality of the writing must have taken SUCH a massive amount of time and effort to produce, because the end result really has amazed the entire world. The way the characters all connect, and the story unfolds itself, is what can only be described as truly magnificent scriptwriting. I would love to have a conversation with the producers about how they connected everything together and tied all the loose strings up, because the story is very complicated and hard to get your head around, which is why you need to concentrate when watching. It is definitely not another Legally Blonde!",2010
10,"It all starts with a suicide. Or is it a car crash? I guess it all depends on whether you choose to start at the beginning or the end. Director Gabriele Muccino gives you the ability to enter his new film Seven Pounds whichever way you prefer as he starts at the end and works his way back to the beginning, showing us the course of events that led us to that heartbreaking 911 call. This is one powerful movie; maybe that is because I'm a softy when it comes to dramas of this ilk, dripping with weighty moments and chock full of devastating performances, but either way, a film works best when it truly touches me, when it lingers in the back of my head hours after leaving the theatre. And this is from the team that brought us the overrated, sappy, and not all that redeeming Pursuit of Happiness, so I'll just say my anticipation was closely guarded for a big letdown. With all that, though, I was with Seven Pounds from the opening frame all the way until the credits rolled. Even though you figure out what Will Smith's character is doing, that secret mission he is trying to complete, it is the way in which he fulfills his penance that shines bright and leaves you with a tear-filled smile at the end.",2008
2,This movie is disturbing on so many levels. ,2010
1,"A hilariously misguided vanity project for Will Smith who wants to be a savior and win that Oscar! The twist is telegraphed from about twenty minutes into this thing and we have to endure a frowny face Will Smith for the entire running time of this fiasco, until the last few minutes of the film where the real comedy begins. This whole thing is creepy dreck, when it's supposed to be a profound drama, but the end is the stuff of unintentional comedy gold. Watching Will Smith commit suicide by jelly fish in a bathtub with the most bombastic dramatic score is epic. No SNL skit can ever reach it's comedic heights, Mel Brooks wished he directed that scene, no comedian in their right mind could come up with something so off the wall hilarious. It's the perfect example of the 'what were they thinking?' scene. Seven Pounds is as bad as they get.",2014
9,"Watching the career of William Smith is not only impressive, but certain to increase in scope, temperament and professionalism. This young man is to say the very least incredible. His talent as well as his versatile performances speak of a true thespian. Here is a case in point. This movie is called "" Seven Pounds "" and relates the story of Tim Thomas (Will Smith), a young man driving a fancy sport's car at high velocity at night in the rain. It's bad enough he is speeding on the interstate, in the dark, talking to his fiancée who's examining a wedding ring, but his diverted attention is not on the road ahead. Directly before him on a collision course is a loaded van, filled with children. What transpires next is the stuff of tragic, horrible, unforgiving nightmares. The movie then follows the remorseful hero as he sets himself a nearly impossible task. Establishing his personal penance, Thomas selects seven people whom he deems worthy and needing help. The character is sincere about his lofty goal, but walks a tightrope between legal action and complex spiritual Karma. In doing so, the audience witnesses his personal struggle and his humble admission to make up for his mistake. Michael Ealy plays his brother Ben, while Woody Harrelson plays Ezra Turner. Rosario Dawson plays Emily Posa, the adhesion to the film and a remarkable assets to the story. A good film and easily recommended, despite the fact the movie strains the audience's patience with its snail's pace and tawdry length. ****",2009
2,"I'll start by saying that the film is well made and has an interesting but pretentious narrative structure with good music that really does help is making an emotional scene. Now onto the bad stuff. And there is a lot. This film is totally obsessed with Will Smith. Even the poster is just a big picture of his head! The whole film just constantly shows this unrealistic god like character who is nicer than Jesus walk around improving the lives of everyone he stumbles across. I mean, there's a blind guy in it who apparently will never get a girlfriend and always be a virgin unless he's helped by the hero ,Will Smith, who can give him his magical all powerful eyes! Now that's just offensive to blind people! Loads of blind people have girlfriends and what kind of message is that?! Bind people will be forever alone if they don't have the eyes of Will Smith?! In the end, the blind guy gets Will's eyes and only because of this, gets a girlfriend as the girl is Will's ex girlfriend and only likes the blind man because of his new eyes. This is just one example of this 'Will Smith is Jesus' rubbish that is actually offensive.The next big problem is how pretentious this film is! It thinks it is clever with a deliberately confusing narrative structure full of pretentious enigmatic lines despite not having a complex plot at all.",2016
5,"Will Smith is a sensational presence on the screen, no question about that. I'm longing to see him in dramatic parts worthy of his talents. ""Ali"" and most of all ""Six Degrees Of Separation"" showed what he is capable of. Elegant, ironic, Cary Grantish. Even here in this maudlin ""message"" movie he manages to inject some kind of truth. But the film is a manipulative, opportunistic (it opens just in time for Oscar consideration)tasteless, silly and confused tale about redemption. If I didn't leave the theatre in the two or three occasions I was about to, is all due to the magnetic power of Will Smith, so much so that I teared up because the sincerity about his sincerity was so amazingly, overwhelmingly sincere. However Oscar is not going to fall for this one, as he did last year with a similar enterprise conducted by the same Italian director. I understand Will Smith's need to be meaningful but somebody should explain clearly the meaning of the word.",2008
1,"Seven pounds is definitely not the worst movie ever, or even comes close.

1,"Quite frankly it seemed like seven hours of boredom as well. What is it? What is it about Will Smith that I just can't stand any longer? I guess he just seems too hellbent on being taken seriously and obtaining an Oscar. I understand how bias this is, but unless he undergoes some new acting lessons I can't ever see him winning one. He's a huge name and is therefore generally confused with being a talented and diverse actor. He's just not. I give him credit for trying so hard, and being able to cry at the drop of a hat. That's about it.",2009

6,"I am a Narnia obsessed nerd, so of course I went to see it the night it was released. I had very high expectations because the first movie was so true to the book. However, with this film that wasn't the case. The screen play was pretty much completely rewritten and included only hints of the original story. I suppose Disney felt it necessary to add in lame typical movie elements that attract mainstream moviegoers. For example a sub-plot romance between Caspian and Susan and battles that never existed. This movie not only failed to develop the characters and events as well as the book, it changed the characters and situations that it did develop.",2008
5,"If you've never read the novel by C.S. Lewis, you will probably think ""Prince Caspian"" is a terrific movie. However, if you enjoyed reading the book, prepare to be disappointed.",2008
1,"Since the Chronicles of Narnia are a series of widely read and revered books I had to give my first rating of a 1 for this film. We went opening night and I was very disappointed and my wife was in tears by the end because of her disappointment. So much of Lewis' humor was lost in favor of an action movie plot with running battles, some added that aren't in the book while other important pieces from the book are left out. It became just one long tedious battle. And a romance between Caspian & Susan? We love those books so very, very much that it was painful to watch. Our children ages 21, 18 & 15, who were raised on Narnia, were not just disappointed but angry... My eldest daughter was livid. Her close friend whom we had introduced to Narnia just two years ago was very unhappy with what was left out of the film not to mention all that was added. My wife and I felt it was as if the person who wrote the screenplay hadn't read the books at all. Two revealing things we noticed too were during the opening credits with Actors and Directors and Producers names in huge type, it seemed to us that ""From a book by C.S. Lewis"" was in much smaller type. Also, during the previews of coming attractions, there was another fantasy movie advertised and it had in large print, ""From a writer of the Chronicles of Narnia"". They must have been referring to a screenwriter, but it was very aggravating! There was only one author of the Chronicles of Narnia and it was C.S. Lewis! Interestingly, they decided to cast all the Telemarines as evil Spaniards. I found that fascinating and would like to know the rationale behind that? In the books, the girls do not participate as warriors, Aslan having said war is unpleasant and decidedly so if girls participate. However, in the movie, Susan is a major warrior and is seen leading Narnians and firing her arrows into Telemarines all over the place. At the final climax and their departure from Narnia, (she and Peter for the last time) she and Prince Caspian first exchange longing glances, which you've been aware of all throughout the film, and then they passionately kiss! I'm all for that of course, but not in this movie about this book... to quote a little boy who was sitting with his grandfather in front of us, ""That was yucky!""",2008
8,"Director Andrew Adamson, who helmed the first installment in the series, after making his career primarily in animation (including the original ""Shrek"") seems decidedly more comfortable in his role as a live action director this time around, and he handles the scope and the pacing of this epic adventure with a polished skill that is a very pleasant surprise. In addition, Georgie Henley, Skandar Keynes, William Moseley and Anna Popplewell, returning as the Pevensie children, have matured, not only physically, but in their acting ability. There is a deftness and self assuredness this time around that surpasses the original, and makes for an extremely entertaining film.",2008
1,"I'm obligated to say that this review contains ""spoilers,"" but I use this term reservedly since I'm not sure this movie can really be spoiled. At least, I'm not sure how you would be able to tell.",2008
8,"This movie isn't half as charming or eloquently magical as the first, but it engages nonetheless.",2008
1,"According to the Wikipedia article, the directors decided to take ""Caspian"" in a darker direction -- and boy howdy, did they succeed! C.S. Lewis's ""Prince Caspian"" was a bright and cheering children's book; Andrew Adamson's ""Caspian"" is a morally ambiguous soap opera filled with horrific battle scenes. Lewis centered ""Caspian"" around the children's trek to Aslan's How, on which Lucy, then Edmund, Peter, and finally Susan begin to see Aslan ahead of them on the trail; but this central scene is only alluded to in the movie with a couple of lines of bad dialogue. The next most important scene, the ""Romp"" with Aslan, is left out entirely, in favor of a bloody battle at Miraz's castle made up by the director.",2008
1,"I was completely disappointed with the movie. I've read Prince Caspian numerous times. The movie was terrible. It fundamentally changed many of the important characters. Aslan, the key character of the book, was emasculated. Peter, originally portrayed as true to Aslan throughout the story came across as a spoiled teenager. The scene in which the White Witch is nearly called back was terrible as well. In the book, neither Caspian nor Peter were tempted to bring her back. The invented romance between Caspian and Susan was awful as well. Don't waste the money on the movie. Buy the book, or get the Focus on the Family Radio Theatre version of Prince Caspian (and the rest of the Chronicles of Narnia).",2008
5,"This movie was pretty interesting to watch, but it had a lot of faults. Yet again, I feel like this movie had so much more potential- just like the first one. It often feels like I am watching a child's version of Lord of the Rings. Yes, I know it is directed towards children, but kids don't need cheesy comments or cheesy acting to enjoy a movie. Also, I don't understand the dramatic female vocals towards the end of both movies. I don't feel like it goes at all with the movie. This movie seemed to have something missing. All there was to it was the kids came back to Narnia, found out what was going on, fought a lot, and then left. The whole ""romance"" between Susan and Caspian was absolutely pointless. First of all, I think they spoke to each other about two or three times, and kept it brief. Then she left? They made it seem like all it was was two teenagers full of hormones...and it was like the creators of the movie decided to throw that in there last minute to attract a broader audience. I think the lack of blood during battle is pointless. There's no need to hide the fact that people have blood running through their veins. A child learns that the first time he/she scrapes their knee. As long as it isn't excessive in a ""Kill Bill"" way, I think it's appropriate. On another note, why was Edmund put into the background so often? He hardly spoke 5 lines!",2008
2,"Well, with SO many good movies coming out this summer, Caspian was one that was up on my list. I knew that they were making it, so I read the book to my daughter last year, and I was really excited. And you have to understand that having 2 small children and trying to get to a movie is no small feat. However, we made our escape tonight to a later showing. ",2008
2,"Disney continues the C.S. Lewis' Narnia tales, but this time makes a boring, over-long, disappointing movie.",2008
1,"I blissfully sat down in my carefully chosen seat placed in the center of the screen at eye level and began rocking my chair in anxious anticipation. I had told myself I would never watch another Chronicles of Narnia movie made by Walden Media after the butchering of the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe, which stripped the storyline of the book down to a skeleton and then plastered modern themes and jokes back on, creating a Frankenstonian monster perfectly happy to leave C.S. Lewis fans screaming in horror. But I thought that just maybe they had a change of heart after the first movie got such bad reviews and how many people (that I know anyway) hated it. Even a friend of mine who never read the books admitted that the BBC versions (which follow as much of the storyline as possible almost word for word with their limited technology) were better than the new films. There was so much potential after all if the BBC versions could get so amazingly close. I should have blissfully left the theater right then in my ignorance of what was to come, but that's the problem with ignorance. You don't realize when you're about to stumble upon something that will shatter your bliss. Within the first few minutes of the movie Caspian unloads his lungs into Susan's microscopically designed horn. For you readers who know the storyline, he hadn't even made it into the hut with Trufflehunter, Nickabrick, and Trumpkin yet. He falls off his horse, sees good old Nickabrick and, digging deep into his guts for bravery, snatches up the horn and does his thing as if thinking, ""Oh s***! It's a midget with a sword half the length of my pinky! I need help NOW!!!"" That's the kind of courage I want my kids to see when they're growing up.",2008
4,"I was annoyed, when LOTR came out, at all the people who complained about the differences between the films and the books. In my opinion, Peter Jackson made the changes he did for excellent reasons. However, the changes made to the storyline of ""Prince Caspian"" were for obviously promotional reasons and they really took away from the original.",2008
3,"I loved the first film and have watched it over and over with my daughter on DVD since we first saw it in the cinema. However, the Prince Caspian screenplay diverged so much from the book they might as well have given this film a different name.",2008
9,"Having just come back from a screening of Prince Caspian, I can honestly say that I got the movie fresh in my mind...and it was amazing! Not only was it better than the first in every way - the story, the acting, the screenplay - but it managed to have more of an edge without sinking into the pitfall that movies such as Pirates of the Caribbean have slipped into.",2008
2,"The only good thing about this movie was that it is visually appealing, from the special effects to the scenery to Ben Barnes. How Kyle Smith could say ""it isn't so overtly Christian"" is unfathomable, unless he's had no exposure to Christianity whatsoever.",2008
1,"Well, I just saw this last night. Basically, from the previews of the movie I knew I would not like it and knew it had just about nothing to do with the book. I only went because my husband wanted me to. I was right. The thing that made me most mad, was that as usual, Hollywood will NOT make a movie without throwing some sort of sex or romance into it, even if there were NO signs of it in the books. They've got a 26 year old playing a character that is supposed to be about 11-13. Obviously, they've changed him into a character of about 17-19, and had him ""yearning"" for Queen Susan, and of course she kisses him in the end. That's Hollywood for ya. If she had done that in the book, she would have SOOOOO been a ""child molester"", because he's just a little boy in the story. That was just the biggest horrible part. The rest of the movie, well, maybe 10% of it followed the story of the book. The other 90% was totally not there. From what I saw, I'm really quite surprised that they kept the main characters' NAMES the same! This is just really NOT a good one for any of the book's fans to see if they're hoping for a good film version of the book.",2008
3,"I will admit that I like the first Narnia film, and was wanting this one to be just as good but for some reason it fell flat for me. Why (other than the fact that my daughter continued to tell me how 'Dreamy' Prince Caspian was) let me count a few of the ways. ",2008
4,"Having seen ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe"" six times in the theatre and purchased the DVD, I was treated to a showing of ""Prince Caspian"" as a birthday present on its opening night. My husband and I were both disappointed. 1. What happened to the story? Yes, many books are slow and may seem boring when translated to film, but this lacks so many of the necessary details of the original story. There are those of us who love romance, but it DOES NOT belong in this story. Yes, battle scenes are enticing to movie-goers, but when was there an attack on Miraz's castle? Dr. Cornelius does not get captured. 2. What's with the Telmarine accent? There could have been something subtle to show that the Telmarines were foreigners to Narnia, but this was ridiculous! 3. Huh? What did they say? Is it possible to speak up a bit and enunciate? I missed so much dialogue; this DID NOT happen in the first movie. 4. Yes, Edmund is more mature and honorable in this story, but Peter did not seem quite so arrogant and vicious. 5. For those who mention the White Witch, no she doesn't have much of a part and well, if person had read the book, he/she would know why. Aslan makes a point of stating why he doesn't appear as much. ",2008
2,"I had such high hopes for this movie...I have always loved Narnia for as long as I can remember, and while Prince Caspian wasn't my favorite one of the books, I still loved the character of Caspian and was looking forward to seeing him, and Reepicheep, and Trumpkin, and all the others...",2008
3,I caught this while on holidays but I won't give any extra details for obvious reasons.,2008
6,"I have a lot of trouble saying that I enjoyed the movie. I've read the book series several times, so I was thrown when the movie started with the birth of Miraz's son and was shortly followed by Caspian blowing Susan's Horn. I felt that the movie skipped a huge opportunity to build up Caspian's character and mindset, as well as Miraz's paranoia towards Narnia, by jumping to the birthing scene. Movie-goers who've never read the book really wouldn't understand why Caspian would be safe in the woods, or why Miraz's council was missing so many members. I also felt that Caspian using the horn when he did, rather than using it after he had already built up an army and had already lost several key battles, took away from his character development. The film, by having the Pevensie children come in so early, made it seem as though the Pevensies were the military geniuses. As a result, when Caspian states that he did not feel ready to be king, the movie audience wouldn't see that as a humble statement. I was confused by the siege of the castle scene, though the justification given in the FAQ makes some sense - I just don't see why it was given so much screen time. And the romance between Susan and Caspian was very odd, unless they placed that in there to allude to The Last Battle, where Susan didn't join the rest of the Pevensies because of her interest in make-up and boys.",2008
8,"""Leverage"" is an entertaining, fun show. The cast is stellar, the writing snappy, and the characters are likable. It's nice to see a show that doesn't focus too heavily on the ""dark side"" of everything and can exist without a message.",2009
9,"After catching the first few episodes of TNT's new series ""Leverage"" I can honestly say that I'm hooked on the adventures of Nathan Ford (Timothy Hutton) and company.",2009
10,"It usually takes me about three episodes of a new series to decide if it's worth continuing to watch. With ""Leverage"" I was hooked after the first 15 minutes. I think it's because it seemed to be an amalgam of some of my favorite TV shows of the past. This includes ""The Equalizer"" (righting wrongs using unconventional methods), ""Mission Impossible"" (the TV series)(putting a great team together to work towards a common goal), and ""Banicek"" (solving seemingly perfect crimes).",2008
9,Finally there is a show that combines all the charm and intelligence of the Ocean's 11 franchise with the uniquely memorable personalities of the A-Team. Watching the pilot episode of Leverage was really a treat. It's been a long time since I've seen a show at the end of which I found myself truly satisfied. ,2008
9,"I love all the characters, edgy, sporty, funny, brilliantly written, entertainingly presented and just plain ""COOL"". I hope this one stays on TV as long as some of my other favorites. (Law & Order, NCIS, CSI and Criminal Minds). I like TV that entertains with a story, twists, turns, doesn't insult my intelligence and keeps me guessing until the very end. Happy Endings are definitely an incentive to keep watching. I can see character development possibilities galore with each team member and I want more back story on each one already. The nostalgic references to old TV Shows is brilliant, this could be the new A-Team, MacGiver, Mission Impossible and does anybody remember the ""campy"" Charlies Angels? Yes, I will admit to watching all of the above.",2008
8,"At an advance preview in Chicago (where much of the ""Nigerian"" pilot was shot), stars TIMOTHY HUTTON (as Nathan) and GINA BELLMAN (Sophie) agreed the first entry in their TNT series is somewhat like an updated ""The 'A' Team"" meets ""Mission Impossible"". Along with Christian KANE (as Eliot), BETH RIESGRAF (Parker), and ALDIS HODGE (Alec), they use high-tech methods to get back at a white-collar CROOK (& the series is scheduled to continue the ""Robin Hood-ish"" adventures against criminals and corporate scammers in subsequent episodes). The main characters start out as distrusting of each other, but eventually use their various individual expertises to create a cheeky, fast-moving and enjoyably clever series of retributions against the liars and other baddies in their world. An agreeable and promisingly well-acted start (well shot on HD cameras that allow fast work with much available-light conditions).",2008
10,"When I was a kid, one of my favorite shows was the A-Team. I loved the show because the heroes were themselves criminals who operated outside of the law to help people. Leverage is like a modern A-Team for adults. The actors are also well cast in their roles. Each one of them brings something interesting to the show. I think what I love the most about this show is that it is FUN!! I don't mean fun as in stupid, brainless reality show fun. It's a fun show to watch and you won't loose any brain cells doing it. I sometimes feel like TV nowadays is so ultra serious. There's no fun in TV drama anymore. I feel like adventure caper TV is back, but in a slick, smart format.",2008
10,"""Leverage?!!!"" People said when they first saw the name of the television series when it came out in 2008. I asked myself the same question when I saw the preview for it on TNT, but when I saw that Timothy Hutton was in it I wanted to see it no matter what the name might be. We all know the Timothy Hutton from the Nero Wolfe T.V. show, on which he played Archie Goodwin, who was a smart, wisecracking, and handsome assistant to the detective of the same name. How could Timothy Hutton be in a movie that is about bad guys? I asked myself after looking up to him most of my life. ""Sometimes bad guys make the best good guys"" which is the motto of the television show. Even though I had my suspicions about it being another profane T.V. show it turned out to be a great show that had great messages in all of its episodes. My brother turned to me one day and said to me about Leverage that ""all of the episodes would make great movies!"" And now after watching all of the first season and part of the second I am convinced of this statement. Is there bad stuff in this show? You are asking yourself at this point and with good cause, but the answer is: no. There are some innuendos in it, but they are very minor. It is basically what you might call a Robin Hood tale of today. The show is worth the watch and should be enjoyed by everyone from 12 and up. Enjoy! -Duke",2009
8,"I could tell from the trailers that Leverage would be the kind of show I'd enjoy - good guys vs. bad guys without the ambiguity of the legal system to get in the way. It did indeed deliver on that promise. It was cleverly paced and scripted and populated with interesting, likable characters.",2008
8,"The show features a team of crooks trying to seek revenge on big companies/people who have done wrong to many people and are seen as bad people. The show in itself is very good, the script is well written, it is slick, witty and entertaining. ",2009
9,"Although this certainly won't win any awards and will always draw comparisons to the BBC's ""Hu$tle"" and the ""Ocean"" movies, it makes for a fun hour of TV watching, carving out a nice niche in American TV.",2009
9,"Leverage might after a first show look like a series replica of Oceans Eleven with even the same generic music attached to some scenes, it fares deeper into a storyline you might expect being left on the cutting room floor of that same movie. Revenge being a large element of the series and changing plots, schemes and situations putting a viewer on the wrong foot this show delivers what all the polish and high-speed actors in forenamed picture couldn't actually deliver: credibility!",2008
10,A Foot in Mouth: Brutally Honest Review.,2015
8,"After watching two seasons of Leverage, it seems appropriate to review it. I enjoyed every moment of watching it and it's not a bad show at all. Some cons were easy to guess, others were not. Interesting characters, but I haven't learnt much about most of them so far. There was some back story to Nathan Ford's character and to Parker too, but very little on the rest. This makes it difficult to relate to them and the impact of the cons less effective on me as a viewer.",2010
7,"I stumbled across this series by accident. It's got Gina Bellman in it, who starred in one of my all-time favorite shows: Coupling So I gave it a try and watched the pilot. Six episodes later, I am sort of hooked.",2009
5,"This is a show that I should, by rights, love - it's got a talented cast, witty capers, and above-average production values thanks partially to Executive Producer Dean Devlin (STARGATE, INDEPENDENCE DAY). Gina Bellman as scam artist extraordinaire and inept stage/film actress Sophie Devereaux, Aldis Hodge as offbeat superhacker Alec Hardison, Christian Kane as hunky Hard Man Eliot Spencer and Beth Riesgarf as borderline-feral burglar Parker all splendidly inhabit their gimmicky roles and make them work as actual living, breathing people you're happy to spend an hour each week with.",2010
3,"I love the premise of this show. Then again, one of my favorite shows of the past decade or so was the all-too-quickly-canceled Firefly, and this show has a bit in common with that thematically speaking. To be specific, it deals with people doing the ""right thing"" in an extra-legal way, so to speak.",2011
6,"It is all too similar to Hustle (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0379632/) but it misses finesse and acting. Even the way they film is similar, slow close-ups, reruns of events at the end, the plan B from the pilot, really can they make up nothing for themselves? Besides that the cast is not as good, all a bit shallow, the show doesn't have the UK humor and style, nothing ever goes wrong.",2010
10,"I don't remember watching all the TV program of Leverage, but what i did manage to watch i loved.",2015
1,"Netflix says this is like Burn Notice, and that it's got 5 seasons. That implies that it's popular. My question is: Why?",2013
5,"This could have been a great show had they not constantly been beating the anti corporate drum. The message was tedious and disingenuous. It got worse each succeeding season. We enjoyed the show when it first came out. I am a big fan of Gina Bellman from her Coupling days on the BBC. The interaction between the characters was good but there were many instances where the acting seemed forced. It was especially noticeable from Timothy Hutton. The plots seemed designed to support an anti free market agenda and it's message stopped being ""Lets go after bad companies"" to ""All big companies are bad"". We stopped watching at the end of the 2011 season and I am not surprised it was canceled due to lack of interest.",2013
4,"I started watching this show with somewhat high expectations as I've heard that it was gaining popularity and i was curious. Unfortunately however at the end of season one I could not bring myself to start season two. While the plots and drama's are very interesting and entertaining, the actors just butcher the script. The emotions, reactions, etc. of all the actors save Timothy Hutton and Gina bellman, just seem so fake that at certain parts i actually cringed while watching. The action scenes, while somewhat amateurish, are well done as well as the personalities given to the actors but sadly the actors chosen will be the fall of this show. I give it a 4 out of 10 to the producer and writers but seriously guys, you need have a better acting eye than that.",2010
3,Slick but left a lot to be desired. They have to improve immensely to keep me as the viewer.,2009
9,You really have to admire Ridley Scott's moxie.,2008
8,"What is most interesting about Body of Lies is that it manages to rise above the predictability and formula that plagues the vast majority of espionage films. It is post-Bourne wrapped up in a more mature Bond plot with a politically conscious edge. Yet it never feels like it is stealing elements of those, more using them as a launch-pad for its own ideas. Though the film itself is sometimes guilty of falling back into safety, it remains consistently exciting and intently engaging even when those moments occur because of how keenly detailed and acted it is. It makes it standout as a cut above many of its contemporaries.",2016
10,"Films involving 'current events'--particularly those relating to anything happening in the Middle East and Terrorism--tend to be soaked in the writers', producers' and director's politics, which usually end up very much in-your-face and spoil the film, because you suddenly lose the story and drown in the preaching and proselytizing.",2008
7,"I have really liked Leonardo DiCaprio's films since he came back from his hiatus (esp Blood Diamond). However, this one was quite forgettable. I enjoyed the movie when I was in the theater and left thinking ""Huh. That was pretty good"". But the week after someone asked what movie I saw and I couldn't remember. It reminded me a lot of ""The Kingdom"" actually (the feel, not the details). It was a very well made film, dialog and script were good, just nothing really stood out and grabbed me. Leo was the shine, he is such a talented actor and I was happy to see him in a great role. I just wish the plot had something fantastic in it to make it into a great film.",2008
5,Political thrillers are not really my bag to be honest - I watch them but do I enjoy them? Not really. So it needs to be a very special type of movie for me to give it the thumbs up. Body of Lies is not that special.,2009
10,"LEONARDO DICAPRIO was brilliant in this movie and he was ably supported by Russell Crowe.Mark Strong was strong(no pun intended) in the few scenes he was featured.The Thing that I like most about this film is its realism.The story was something i felt i have already seen before but quite interesting to follow. CIA tries to take down a terrorist leader.. action / drama and thriller moments mixed to a enjoyable movie. There are quite many things to keep track so pay extra attention to the story. Overall a well done movie.With fantastic editing and a well-structured story, Body of Lies is a dark, gritty, and complex spy thriller.Leonardo DiCaprio plays a CIA agent undercover in the Middle East, gathering intelligence on an Al-Qaida terrorist network, negotiating and double crossing with both the Jordanian security service and his CIA superior (a very snaky Russell Crowe). There's quite a lot to take in during the early stages of this movie and there's some well staged action scenes.",2016
9,V. well-made; everyone from the cast and crew pulled their own weight in Body of Lies.,2008
9,"Amidst all the slam-bang, Body of Lies is actually a superb character study of two preening, bumbling CIA (presumably) agents trying to save the world in the Middle East. Roger Ferris (Di Caprio) is the agent on the ground, and Ed Hoffman (Crowe) is his remote-control boss in Washington. Their collective M.O. is to overreact and improvise at every turn, aided and abetted by their deep attachment to high-tech gadgetry and fundamental disregard for human lives. Their ally and foil, the Jordanian head of intelligence (Mark Strong), prefers more patient methods informed by a less skin-deep understanding of the people(s) involved.",2008
6,"I watched ""Body of Lies"" the other night for the first time since having seen it in the theater. This is a well made film that just barely misses the mark of being outstanding.",2016
4,"I agree that the acting was quite good here, and some of the plot was intelligent and interesting, particularly the Hani character. Ferris' moments with Hani are the only elements that support his emotional conclusion - you can see his respect for the culture come through. But this should have been supported by more positive modeling from the local characters.",2011
8,One of the Greatest Directors of All time has picked a touchy subject for his newest film. Did Rid pull it off?,2008
6,"The craftsmanship behind director Ridley Scott's 2008 convulsive political thriller is impressive, but having acts of terrorism drive an intentionally labyrinth plot reveals how they impede the story structurally, an insurmountable barrier that screenwriter William Monahan (""The Departed"") can't seem to overcome. The movie's first half is all the more bewildering for all the double-crosses and cover-ups that serve to set up the central situation. Based on Washington Post columnist David Ignatius' 2007 novel, the movie focuses on embedded CIA operative Roger Ferris who is on an undercover assignment to hunt an Al-Qaeda terrorist leader named Al-Saleem. Ferris is not entirely alone as he is connected via cell phone with his stateside boss Ed Hoffman, who is the head of the CIA's Near East division and directs Ferris toward life-threatening tasks in a most nonchalant manner from his upscale suburban home.",2008
8,"Ridley Scott has always been very consistent in my mind as a filmmaker. He has occasional flashes of genius (Alien, Gladiator), but always seems to make steady, good, interesting, and watchable films. The same applies here with Body of Lies. While the film will not be this year's major awards contender, Body of Lies is among the better films by Scott, somewhere between American Gangster and Black Hawk Down.",2008
4,"Body of lies is OK, but that's about it. Maybe i'm just stupid, or maybe I'm just put off by political movies so much that i lose concentration. The film seemed to jump from one plot to another and i didn't really understand what was going on... or why. The first 30 minutes are interesting. The action and storyline are gripping to watch. But after Dicaprio's friend is smashed to 'pieces' in a car crash, i had no idea what was going on. the final 30 minutes started to make sense - the CIA setting up some people with mild terrorist connections into a fake terrorist group so they could infiltrate the big bad terrorist. But I still struggled to make sense of how they went about it and how it fell apart. And couldn't that have been the plot for the whole movie? it sounded good enough and it was the part of the film that made me think 'aahhhhhhh' But what i ask myself is, what the hell happened before all that? If political propaganda is your kind of thing, then check it out. If not, stay away from this movie.",2010
5,"Body of Lies is a story about a CIA operative played by Leonard Dicarprio and his boss, Ed Hoffman, played by Russell Crowe. Crowe gained about 40 lbs to play the middle-aged supervisor Hoffman who spends a good deal of time on a cellphone from CIA Headquarters in Langley, Virginia talking with Dicaprio's Roger Ferris who shuttles around the Mideast, principally in Iraq and Amman, Jordan. Ridley Scott, the director, makes use of pinpoint satellite images throughout the movie, suggesting that the CIA has the ability to spy on various targets closeup through the use of overhead drones. It's very cool looking but can they actually do that? I wonder.",2009
5,"Ridley Scott, Leonardo DiCaprio, Russell Crowe. Great names doing an unwise film. Boby of Lies isn't anything more than an American flick about terrorism. Althoug, there are some good aspects on it.",2008
7,"Body of Lies is a scary film because you are never certain what is going to happen next. Dicaprio excels as Ferris, middle-east-based CIA agent who actually likes being in the middle east. He and his counterpart, Crowe (as Hoffman), who is based stateside, are both seasoned espionage agents tracking a middle eastern bomber blowing up places in Europe. Deals and side deals, observers in crowds, cars following you, people talking quietly in groups. All this ratchets up the drama about who knows what, and who is being grabbed next. When you throw in a potential love interest for Dicaprio, that raises the tension and mystery yet more.",2016
6,"As a visual spectacle, Body of Lies often impresses. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance also has its moments in the movie. For other commentators, those factors seem to be sufficient to rate it highly. I, on the other hand, was tempted to rate it lower than 6 as I found it to fall completely flat as entertainment.",2009
5,"In a role that's tailor made for his preening, self-involved public persona, Leonardo DiCaprio plays an intense CIA agent who doesn't play by the rules in his fight against terrorism in the Middle East. Russell Crowe is his slovenly Langley-based boss. The overly complex plot in Body of Lies is often ludicrous, with cardboard characters and a heavy-handed tone that attempts to paint a complicated situation in black-and-white terms.",2009
3,"Very hard to develop any attachment to any of the characters. Many of the characters just do not come anywhere near matching up to what one would reasonably expect from their types - especially the highly-intelligent and suspicious CIA spook who falls almost instantly for a girl he knows nothing about. The script simply fails to bring these characters to any point where I could emotionally connect with them, instead just allowing them to dangle along throughout the whole film. Due to this, I found it very hard to even think about entering the world as presented on the screen, it was simply too cluttered with lingering thoughts about what just happened, and why it didn't make any sense.",2010
2,"Maybe being a government bureaucrat is not the most glamorous way of making a living but it's still a way to make a living. However, after watching this movie, one may come away believing that every government bureaucrat is a lazy, bloated, conceited, paper pusher who lives exclusively to partake of his next lunch break. Not exactly a pretty picture, but this is the picture that the audience has to endure when watching what is nothing more than another tedious, noisy, overacted action movie. Just what the doctor ordered ... right? How many more of these movies has Hollywood made? One thousand? Two thousand? The formula for making these movies is so beaten into the dust that by now it should be completely unrecognizable. The locales change but the plots remain the same, and with the same shallow character development and the equally shallow acting as trained performers are asked to devolve into pseudo-cartoon characters and act accordingly. This movie seemed to run-on interminably. ""When will this movie end?"" I repeatedly thought to myself. Leonardo DiCaprio was totally unbelievable as a CIA operative, but what has to be one of the great gaffs of miscasting, an overweight Russell Crowe plays a CIA bureaucrat. Please note that in this movie the on site operative is ""lean and mean"" while his desk jockey supervisor is fat. This is called stereotyping. What was the casting director thinking? Why not have Jack Nicholson play an overweight office clerk? Or Nicole Kidman play a frumpy department store saleswoman? And the story was so fantastic that no amount of literary license could afford it credibility. An obviously non-Arab American (Mr. DiCaprio) trying to pass himself off as an Arab ... speaking fluent Arabic ... concocting all kinds of hair brain schemes that are doomed to failure ... trying to out think and outfox real Arabs who are completely unfooled by his laughable Arab masquerade ... trying to romance a Palestinian woman while in the middle of conducting a highly sensitive and complex espionage mission ... etc. By now you get the point. Next time try casting an actual Arab in the role. Not even the most naive movie goer can believe all that. There should be a rough balance between the protagonist and antagonist. In this movie the protagonist is so transparent and incompetent that it leaves the story in shambles. Next stop for this movie - DVD land and oblivion. And one other thing. Don;t let this movie discourage you from working for the government. The pay may not be great, but the fringe benefits are excellent, a critical fact that this movie conveniently omits.",2008

7,"Finally an above average political thriller that is effective and surprisingly politically neutral. That's not to say it won't irk those on the far reaches of either aisle in addition to the always irritable Iranian government. But, Body of Lies is a plot driven espionage thriller that demonstrates the basics of what Western intelligence has done right and wrong in the post 9/11 era without being preachy or shoving too much at the audience.",2008
9,"Watching two episodes of ""Wallander"" makes me think of Isabelle Huppert's line in Hal Hartley's great ""Amateur"": ""everything I write comes out sad. Why do you think that is?"" Kenneth Brannagh's shambling, weary detective Kurt Wallander is as far from TV's 'Columbo' as it's possible to get, despite certain physical similarities.",2008
10,"Other reviewers have already praised this series adequately. I only want to add that this series renewed my interest in seeing just about every film or TV presentation that Kenneth Branagh has acted in. He's been in some vehicles that weren't terrific, but he is unfailingly a great actor. ",2011
9,"Detective Kurt Wallander, a man in perpetual need of a shave and a healthy meal is a noir-by-day modern gumshoe fighting for justice. His dedication has cost him. His wife left him after finding out he's already married to his work. His daughter is an earnest and dutiful supporter of the detective, but oblivious to the evil his eyes see daily. Not sure how he's doing it, but Kenneth Branagh OWNS this role and he's *really* appealing as this frayed-at-the-edges public servant. Shot like a mini-series, or a movie for TV, I admit I am impressed with his ability to flex into this role that is so utterly unlike his Shakespeare work. Frankly, he acts circles around the other cast members. A must-see for the mildest Branagh fan and good enough for any mystery/detective story lover. FYI: Disc 1 has two episodes. Disc 2 has one episode and special features that has spoilers if you don't see the other shows first. I was disappointed that I saw the 3rd episode before the first two. I understand there are 3 more episodes ordered for 2010. 07/09",2009
8,"This new addition to the TV detective genre grabbed my attention and I was rewarded by an enjoyable drama. I was impressed by the scenery, Nordic interiors and ambiance of this piece, and it had an atmosphere of Northern light that reminded me of other detective stories set in the north, such as Insomnia (Al Pacino, in Alaska) or Smilla's Feeling for Snow. That atmosphere was compelling and Ken Branagh's performance kept my attention, although the plot seemed to be heading in a certain direction and the answer was not a big surprise. The fact that everyone spoke English but all were clearly Swedish was amusing as well. That aspect reminded me of Gorky Park, in which all the Russians spoke with English accents. It allows the suspension of disbelief and the English-speaking viewer feels drawn into another culture. I don't usually watch detective/murder mysteries these days because I don't enjoy murder as a spectator sport, but this was worth seeing because of the performances and the unusual setting, sets, high production values and stunning photography. Looking forward to the next 2 episodes.",2008
10,This is a series of high quality with storyline based on the successful novels of Henning Mankell and on an outstanding actor in the leading role.,2011
9,"I usually enjoy British-made mystery series, and ""Wallander,"" starring Kenneth Brannaugh, is one of the recent series that particularly stands out.",2009
10,"Wallander is a British television series adapted from the Swedish novelist Henning Mankell's Kurt Wallander novels & starring Kenneth Branagh as the depressed gloomy police inspector (who is also separated from his wife). Wallender is the Swedish equivalent of Inspector Morse. The six-episode series from BBC Scotland was broadcast first on BBC One from November to December 2008. It is the first time the Wallander novels have been adapted into an English-language production. The protagonist, Kurt Wallander, is played by Kenneth Branagh. He describes Wallander as ""an existentialist [...] who is questioning what life is about & why he does what he does every day, & for whom acts of violence never become normal. There's a level of empathy with the victims of crime that's almost impossible to contain, -one of the prices he pays for that sort of empathy is a personal life that's a kind of wasteland. Primarily filmed in Ystad Sweden. The 1st disc includes the episodes Sidetracked & Firewall. This series was also partially produced by Branagh personally. See IMDb 1178618 for info & synopsis of all episodes. For some reason n flix is only stocking episode 3 of season 2 leaving us viewers with 3 episodes unseen. This series is so excellent I will buy them on Ama/zon if I have to. To me this series is just the BEST crime drama I have ever viewed. Great sets with highest production values- great plots from the famous Mankells books. The cinematography is just phenomenal—really stunning photography. Branagh as the police detective with personal demons is so powerful in this role. He portrays a complex Wallander with all his character defects-but Branagh helps the character remain sympathetic to us the viewers. Films presentation enables the viewer to understand what they (the ensemble cast) are thinking, feeling. Murder is grotesque & there are some very bloody scenes in this. This absolutely the most spellbinding 180 minutes of film I have seen in a long long time.",2010
8,"Beautifully shot in great locations. Full of English character actors like David Warner and Malcolm Tierney. Kenneth Branagh is superb as the dour Scandinavian policeman. In the first episode, he faces a serial killer with an axe, some severely traumatised young people, a separated wife who's just ""met somebody"", a bolshy daughter, a father with incipient Alzheimers, a young criminal profiler who thinks he knows everything... It could be corny - especially the obligatory soapy stuff about the detective's home life - but the cast ACT instead of indulging in the overdone thesping that makes series like Waking the Dead unwatchable. OK, let's face it, it IS corny. The direction (and art direction) dazzle, but we can still see all the old cop show clichés. The style is ripped off from the French cop series Engrenage (which lifted its entire plot from Murder One). Doesn't stop it from being compusively watchable, tho.",2008
10,"I've seen all of the 3 ""new"" Wallander-movies and I have to say that they are the best so far. Kenneth Branagh's acting is superb. He reanimates the character of Kurt Wallander to a whole new level. Every characteristic of the person is played in a very distinct way. Beginning with filming and camera positions, all of the new Wallander Movies have great moments which are very intensive to watch. I haven't seen much TV-productions with such quality so far. Besides the various broadcasting-times in Germany (probably due to the laws of youth protection), I have no arguments against this Wallander-Thrillers. If you liked the previos Mankell-Stories, you will love this (more book-based) version of the story.",2011
6,"Both the first series of Swedish TV's Wallander and the second collection of British TV's interpretations have recently been aired on British TV, and whilstthey share a number of elements and qualities (locations, excellent filmatography, thoughtful and impressive 'takes' on the central figure of Kurt Wallander), it's the differences that seem to separate a good television drama from an outstanding one.",2010
9,"While it does have its slow moments, and one or two plots may have moments that are hard to keep up. Regardless of how inferior it is or not to the 2005 series which is admittedly absolutely brilliant, this is still extremely good and any other flaws if any are compensated by the quality of how the series is made, constructed and acted. For instance, the Swedish setting is truly evocative and very often stunning. The music is haunting too, while the writing is of really good quality and the stories in general very well written. And then we have Kenneth Branagh, who I think is a great actor and more than decent director, especially in Shakespeare. He is brilliant as the dour and world-weary Kurt Wallander, and Sarah Smart, Jeany Spark, Rixhard McCabe and David Warner solidly support him. Overall, this is a well done television series. 9/10 Bethany Cox",2010
1,"Whoever writes this series should go back to watching professional wrestling. We have watched it because we watch all Masterpiece mysteries, usually with relish! The acting is pretty good, perhaps the only redeeming quality of the show. The music is forgettable - nothing at all like Morse, Foyle's War, etc. The scenery is flat, misty, and dull - like the rest of the show. That's perhaps the only redeeming bit about the show, that the scenery matches the melancholy of the main character. But the biggest tragedy is the pathetic police work of the main character. He's forever pointing a gun at a vehicle, only to get nearly run down, and letting the bad guy get away without so much as shooting out his tires. He's forever blundering into dangerous situations like the proverbial character in a horror film backing his way through a doorway to a spooky room, only to get attacked by the evil within. He consistently refuses to answer the questions that other characters ask -- for no reason other than to annoy the audience. He seldom calls for backup when the casual observer knows there's danger ahead. He finds a crucial piece of evidence and then carries the only copy of it into a dangerous situation without leaving copies with his co-workers or reporting to them first. His pathetic self-pity makes him incompetent. He cannot ""read"" another character, for instance when the young woman, his daughter's friend, comes to him for help, obviously distressed. He leaves the room to go find a phone book telling the girl he's going to call her mother. If she wanted to talk to her mother, she would have done that in the first place. So she wanders off and HE'S SURPRISED!!! Egad! He leaves so many questions unasked when he's investigating. He nearly got his co-worker killed by the stupidity of his actions. In the real world, he would have been busted all the way down to ""meter-maid"" by the second episode. I'll probably watch future episodes. It's fun to predict all the stupid things he does.",2012
3,"If you love Mankell's Wallander books, then see the Swedish versions, either with Rolf Lassgard or Kirster Henricksson. They have English subtitles, and the character of Wallander is much better defined and as the books describe.",2011
5,"or in any real life situation for that matter. I'm a great fan of Branagh, he could read the phone-book with feeling. BUT as the constantly depressed and melancholic detective Karl Wallandar, he begins to grate. Yes, of course it's the direction and the tampering of the writers with the original Swedish version and the excellent series of books but truly, this version has become almost unintelligible in dialogue and so very unintelligent in script.",2015
10,"I enjoy a good mystery that doesn't drag, Kenneth Branaugh shines in this it's modern hip & it doesn't over saturate your senses.I recommend it just on the strength of good strong characters in this series,there not to complex where they drag you to sleep.The shocking scenes in this series are not to far over the top,your attention is maintained without all the special effects you would think that crimes such as these don't happen to often in Sweden,the writer makes you believe,so if you live in a bubble existence this will be a shocker to you.Furthermore the character feels real to me he has legitimate problems that he balance's out pretty well with his coworkers & daughter,he doesn't rant & rave like most cop show character's & he's not dry either.",2009
3,"It's the tried and true BBC/Mystery formula (as popularized so many years ago by the ""Morse"" series) of the detective with personal problems as portrayed in a landscape with a fine sense of place. Unfortunately, this template has been used so much it has become contemptuously familiar. This time around, everything is so hyped up as to be annoying. The title character spends an inordinate amount of time driving around (in a Volvo) pretty, rural ultra-Swedish locations (shot with the color saturation set on max and plenty of filters) accompanied by portentous, repetitive, overly dramatic music. Do not mistake tarted-up, attractive pictures with good cinematography. These scenes appear to have been added merely to prove the show was shot in Sweden and to fill out the hour and a half program length. By the third episode the plot seems to be more (by far) about the detective's personal problems with just enough whodunit added to keep the pot on simmer. The music track is also burdened with a title theme featuring a ""sensitive singer-songwritery"" voice crooning words that do not appear to have anything at all to do with the story (or even have any coherent meaning) in typical alt/pop fashion. Once in each episode there is a collegial meeting in which Our Hero bursts into angry shouting and storms out of the room only to be followed by his boss who tenderly suggests he go home and have a nice lay down. It can only be assumed that the demographic for this show was middle-aged, comfortably wealthy women who want to fantasize about Kenneth as the sensitive-type he-man. However, how can we take seriously a person who needs to have other people die horribly before he can make any self-realizations? Why would any police force allow a person such as this to be in charge of solving heinous crimes? In all fairness I should say that the acting is quite good, not only Mr. Branagh but also some nice supporting actors (a couple of whom had regular roles in the ""Lovejoy"" series a few years back). Having never been to Sweden I now know that Swedes appear to be obsessed with people in hoodies abusing senior citizens.",2011
10,"For some reason, I have this morbid fascination with the complex male character. Wallander feeds my need to crawl inside the male brain and watch a man driven by inward demons perform his difficult job of catching killers.",2014
8,"I have to agree with ""bpotte's"" review from 2012. Wallander is the dumbest cop in Europe. Hopefully he is the dumbest cop in the world or we America is in danger of extinction. I have only watched one episode, but it is mind boggling that anyone could be so self absorbed as to endanger the entire population of Sweeden by your active incompetence. By the end of the first season he will need to move and ravage a new country as there will be no-one left alive in Sweeden. But if the show is at all accurate, getting killed in Sweeden should be considered mercy killing. What a depressingly sterile country. The only reason for their relatively average suicide rate is the apathy the must engulf the entire population. ",2014
3,"Having read all of Mankell's Wallander stories I was extremely disappointed with the series featuring Kenneth Branagh in the lead role - I have seen 5 of the 6 to date. Having always enjoyed Branagh's work I feel the problem here lies with the director who has decided to present Wallander as a weak blubbering depressive constantly on the verge of total mental and physical collapse. This is not the Wallendar of the books. Additionally the part of the demented father is way overplayed probably to increase the role to give David Warner, a major actor in his own right, more meat for his participation. The role of Ann-Britt is also much diminished to the point that in the first three stories she is rarely seen, speaks only a few words and is not identified by name. In summing up the series. Poorly done - what a pity.",2010
5,"A grumpy, middle-aged loner investigates a string of unlikely serial killings in a picturesque town - it sounds like a description of Colin Dexter's detective, Inspector Morse, but it also covers Wallender, his Swedish equivalent. Having recently watched a Swedish television adaptation of the Wallender books, the idea of Wallander as a Swedish Morse was certainly apparent. But in this BBC version, it seems a deliberate attempt has been made to change the script. Kenneth Brannagh plays Wallander as a quiet, depressed man, seemingly devoid of any charisma or natural authority, lost in his own existential woes; the force of Morse's personality is not in any way apparent. The direction of the series tends to the filmic as well, breaking from the step-by-step approach of the classic television detective story and preferring a more impressionistic, atmospheric approach. Personally, I'm not so convinced that either of these innovations work - Brannagh's permanent internal grief grates and does not convince (most people learn to wear a mask on their misery as a prerequisite for survival), while I didn't always find it possible to follow the details of the plots. There's also a certain innate problem of having English actors, speaking English, playing Swedes; if one is looking for insight into the Scandinavian character, one won't find it here. The final problem, the improbably complex actions of the killers in each story, is innate to the source material. 'Wallander', in conclusion, takes itself just a little too seriously; there's not enough material to justify it's metaphysical pretence. The Swedish version did a better job as a straightforward detective thriller, even if it had a certain familiarity to viewers of 'Inspector Morse'.",2009
7,"Very glad to learn Ingeborga Dapkunaite is returning for the fourth season .. hopefully she can rescue him.. and this series from its dismal, doomed feeling.. (is there anytime any sun in these locations?). Wallander is a good show.. decidedly not for mass appeal, but none the less worthwhile viewing. But surely the lead character could be less distant and forlorn (it is never ending with doom and gloom surrounding him). The series needs to be rescued. Crime dramas are always less interesting than the life-stories of the characters described within them. There's three chances left.. let's roll the dice.. and wish it winds up on the side of hopefulness.",2016
8,"The other thing is that Kenneth Branagh is an international star, thus his Wallander is more distinguishing and less team player: his colleagues have less importance and less time on screen than in the Swedish version. Branagh's Wallander is also more unsociable and seems more depressed, underlined by long scenes focusing on his face expression under driving or walking. The big plus is that the Brits have tried to create the Swedish atmosphere as much as possible, signs are in Swedish etc. Well, the UK and Sweden have same latitudes, so the filming of Swedish nature was also possible in England.",2013
1,"There's no reason to waste a lot of time or space reviewing this pathetically silly crime series. English actors with pronounced English accents and slang portraying Swedish characters in Sweden produces an amazingly absurd result. I'm pleased I watched the Swedish version of this series first or I may never have after slogging through three episodes of English Kurt Wallander. Not only that, but this version of Wallander is horribly inept- just when you expect him to ask a key question of a witness, he either gazes into space, mumbles something incoherent and trudges off or is interrupted to answer his cell and- apparently unable to handle more than a single task- never follows through with the all-important question.",2017
7,"Branagh portrays Henning Menkel's obsessed and depressive detective with morose conviction. Instead Wallander feels as if it has been done the other way around, like a typical British TV crime drama transplanted to Sweden. The actors' curiously stilted and accent-less English often grates on the ear and the use of Swedish names and places requires the same suspension of disbelief required to listen to dubbed films. It also makes it difficult for the actors to flesh out their characters or make them entirely believable in a Swedish context.",2014

10,"Street Kings (2008) is one of the best cop action thrillers from Keanu Reeves. This movie was released in 11 April 2008 (USA) after hearing about this movie that Keanu Reeves made another action movie I rushed to see it right away, if it is any good and I was right! It is a good action thriller! It is one of my favorite best Keanu Reeves movies, I am still a big fan of him and I always enjoy this movie. I also had no idea that Chris Evans (Captain America The Winter Soldier, Avengers) started in this movie as the main support cast opposite of Keanu Reeves. Chris acted outstanding in here as Detective Paul Diskant. This is a slick perfect action thriller about dirty cops and a cop been killed, while other cop is blamed and framed for his death, by other follow officers, now he has to clear his name and punished the guilty ones and finding a Justice on his own way! I know a lot of people don't like this movie that is fine, but is 1.000.000 times way better to seeing this flick than watching the new Keanu Reeves movie Knock Knock! The mystery, the acting and the action in this movie is outstanding!",2015
9,"Here's another movie the critics dismissed that turned out to be a great movie. I was initially hesitant to go see the movie because of the negative reviews, but went to see Forrest Whittaker, Hugh Laurie and Keanu Reeves. I think most critics can't look at Reeves and not see Bill Preston Esq or Neo. However Keanu Reeves shows range in the movie and heads up the movie wonderfully.",2008

8,"""Street Kings"" definitely has the street-cred. Keanu looks real bad-ass, Forrest Whittaker looks like he's digging back into the character he played on ""The Shield"", writer director David Ayer is no stranger to life on the cop circuit, having written ""Dark Blue"" and ""Training Day among others, and the movie also brings on the token rappers for good measure in Common and The Game. But does it work? Reeves plays Tom Ludlow, a Vice detective on a Special Forces unit in LA, led by Ludlow's friend and former partner Captain Wander (Forrest Whittaker). Ludlow's a dirty cop, but he feels in a good way. He'll execute and then tweak the crime scene if it means taking the low-lifes off the streets for good.",2008

Keanu Reeves is always getting bashed by the critics because he refuses to advertise his private life like Tom C. The man deserves his privacy, just like the rest of us. All the acting was top-notch, nothing over the top or wooden. Real testosterone, just like the law enforcers I know. You have to have the balls to be a cop these days.

7,"I didn't go into Street Kings expecting a masterpiece, and I didn't get one. What I did expect is what I got, more or less: a competently made corrupt cops drama that throws on some heap-loads of stereotypes (not just racially or ethnically but just movie stereotypes, which may possibly be true to form them), and even crazy hysterics. If there is any significant achievement it's in taking the cop movie into such depraved depths it's like looking at a very entertaining infected boil: you know it'll pop any minute, and the pus might just run out a little bit here and there till there's more to squeeze out. There's almost an underlying current of hopelessness that gives the movie some intellectual lift, but at the same time it's such a time-waster that unless you're hardcore fans of the actors it's just about worth a rental.",2008
10,"I wasn't expecting to like this movie; the cop genre is not my favorite after all, but I did. I really did. It does feel like a B movie or sort of film noir, perhaps because it only cost 20 million to make. But the cast was top notch. As much as I love Keanu Reeves, I always go into any movie of his cringing, ""Will he do well? Will he survive this?"" And Reeves delivers with aplomb. This is easily his most nuanced role to date - he truly wears the weight of a cop who has seen and done too much on his face. The action scenes were kick ass and I loved to see Amaury Nolasco play against his Prison Break type. All the actors were great, though I thought Forest Whitaker was a little OTT.",2008
7,"It's a well crafted film, with very good gun fighting scenes that tends to become a bit overboard, but still realistic enough. The story is predictable, but satisfying enough without being over complicated.",2008
8,"When I first took this in at the theater, I had high expectations, and it still blew me away. I remain spell-bound by this. It is an extensively well-thought-out and entertaining film. The plot is compelling, engaging and keeps developing, and while I had a hunch about one twist, I did not see them all coming. This has spot-on pacing, not a boring second to be found, or an overwhelming one for that matter. The cinematography and editing are excellent throughout. Every moment of the action is awesome, intense and exciting without being unrealistic(within the bounds of Hollywood, that is... which, if going by this, is actually entirely acceptable), and there is a solid and fitting amount of it. The music is appropriate for where this is set, not to mention really cool, consisting mainly of hardcore rap. As you can probably figure out, the tone of this is brutal, dark and gritty, through and through, and should not be viewed by anyone who may not be able to take it. The writing is astounding; the script, the dialog, the overall story, all of it. There is a lot of slang(the subtitles certainly helped me out), and some instantly memorable and utterly quotable lines. Almost all of the humor, which is also very rough(and the amount of which is considerable), lies in what is said, how it's put and/or its delivery; think verbal, British comedy(with four-letter words). The characters are distinguished, credible, and psychologically accurate, with no real exceptions, and while there is a heavy dose of macho-ism and bloated egos(some bits are soaked in, and dripping, testosterone), it never gets ludicrous, and there are several characters who help keep it grounded, in their more agreeable personalities. I think it is also notable that this, beyond a sequence lasting no longer than a few seconds, this does not at any point stoop to the lowest common denominator and try to appease and appeal to the young male demographic by simple parading something to gawk at. This isn't denying the existence of such, it just has nothing gratuitous in the way of it other than aforementioned brief part. The acting is magnificent, for basically every part(I owe Evans a heartfelt apology, the guy can actually do great work, and be pretty bad-ass), Reeves is believable, and Whitaker performs well in everything required of him in this. Both Laurie and Mohr, honestly, if you didn't know they usually go for making people laugh, you wouldn't know from this, they're straight-faced and professional all the way(and I'm not saying they're not funny in this). There is plenty of disturbing content and a ton of strong violence and language in this. The DVD holds an interesting director's commentary, a handful of informative featurettes, deleted scene with the option of hearing Ayer's thoughts on them(by the way, David, if I may call you that, I promise you, you put another movie up on the silver screen, and I *will* almost without a doubt go to the cinema to catch it when it comes out), alternate takes and vignettes(really short documentaries). All of them are well worth the time. I recommend this to fans of the people involved in making it, as well as of the genres and those who want to watch pictures set in this environment. 8/10",2010
6,"James Ellroy penned tale of a cop, played by Keanu Reeves, who is a loose cannon sent on the trail of the killer of his murdered partner. Protected by his captain because he can get things done and hounded by Internal Affairs, Reeves soon finds he is descending into a world that he really should not be part of. Reeves is okay, if a bit wooden as our antihero. Part of the problem is that he isn't given a great deal to do beyond allowing events to play out around him. To be certain he is a participant in events but there is a coldness to him that doesn't give a great many clues as to what is happening inside him. One would suspect he took the role because it offered him a chance to say some pithy lines, and behave in a more or less serious manner. The rest of the cast is quite good and one suspects that Forest Whitaker (as his boss) and Hugh Laurie (The Internal Affairs guy) took the roles because they got to play a bit against type. Good instead of great the films script, a long time in the oven, shows signs of being worked and reworked so much that the script becomes confused because too many hands lost track of what was going on. Rest assured that the central thrust and much of the dialog seems to be the work of Ellroy, the ending is most assuredly his in plot if not writing, but all of the details the additional writers have added have blurred what ever had attracted a long line of directors and stars to the project. Worth a look on DVD or cable where you're more likely to forgive the flaws.",2008
8,"Okay, let's face it. The credibility factor in almost ALL action flicks is questionable at best. If you really took the time to analyze the logic behind the story, you'd come up short. But, by definition, action pics are just that -- heavy on the action, and not so heavy on the logic that supports the story. With this in mind, Street Kings is a solid, well-executed action flick that has all the right ingredients: a non-conformist hero you WANT to root for; a never-let-up story that keeps you riveted to the end; and a stylish, fast-paced visual smörgåsbord that delivers from start to finish.",2008
7,"I wasn't expecting much from Street Kings, just to be entertained and that's what I got. Keanu Reeves played the part good, Hugh Laurie did exceptionally well, while the worst acting in the movie was from Chris Evans. Chris Evans was wooden and didn't seem to be able to act his way out of a glass box, during the argument in the locker room between him and Reeves I bit my tongue to keep from laughing as Reeves was actually doing a good job. The story was good, flawed and slow in places, but overall good. Sure the movie could've had a better cast but it doesn't and the only surprise here is that Chris Evans was worse than Keanu Reeves.",2008
6,"What I love about David Ayer's work is that he is unpredictable and unafraid to tell a story in all its brutality. From his penned script Training Day to his directorial debut in Harsh Times, we are treated with bad men and worse men, doing what they need to survive and not worrying about the consequences. When I saw the trailer for his new film Street Kings, I thought I'd be in for a three-peat, but I should have looked at the writing credits. Don't get me wrong, I like James Ellroy and Kurt Wimmer, I enjoy much of their work, however, knowing Ayer's catalog makes me believe that it was their fault why I did not love this film. The aesthetic is there, the language is there, and the violence is never shied away from, but the story itself never surprises. You will be able to see what will happen straight from the getgo and unfortunately that just isn't what I'm used to seeing with Ayer. I expected more and hopefully for his next film he won't go gun-for-hire and write his own new urban street tale.",2008
9,"So I continue my foray into the theatrical releases this week as a break from the Festival proceedings, and choosing Street Kings is a no brainer. It was in Speed that Keanu Reeves donned a Kevlar vest and a devil may care attitude to save a speeding bus from annihilation, and after that he's gone on to other blockbusters such as the Matrix trilogy and countless of other romance movies. Here, he revisits that action genre as a cop with questionable morals, and while some may gripe over his acting ability, I thought that he was given a role totally within his range - that of a clueless gunslinger who's caught up in a web of intrigue far greater than he can fathom.",2008
2,"Street Kings"" is an over-the-top, unrealistic portrayal of corruption within the police force. Setting it in LA is the only way to make a film with such ambition of distorting reality even possible. LA is heavily diverse with all kinds of people which is a good backdrop for racism and more importantly racist cops. LAPD is also a place where the police have been scrutinized and publicly shamed for involvement in corruption that resorts anywhere from murder to police brutality to not paying for coffee. And in the one track mind of David Ayer who hit it big with ""Training Day""- which was a much better film, but also terribly flawed as well- just can't seem to get away from showing cops in a extremely negative light. Here he basically rips off his own film again- see ""Harsh Times"". The good thing about ""Training Day"" was Ethan Hawke's character. He was a good cop under the wing of a corrupt cop. There was a good and evil battle there. Keanu Reeves is supposed to be that good guy, but he's a veteran of 18 years and he has quite a history of corruption. Right from the first scene of the film he's puking because, naturally, he's an alcoholic due to the death of his wife. A lot of cops are alcoholics so it's only natural for the main character, once again, to be an alcoholic in a David Ayers film. Then he goes and buys little airplane bottles of Vodka- three of them- chugs them down, then proceeds to make a routine sell to a couple of Asians who are looking to buy a Machine gun. These Chinese (Or whatever they are) are the guys he's looking for in a kidnapping of two missing persons. Ludlow (Reeves) goes on a racist tirade about their looks and then they follow that up by beating the crap out of him. Only then does he tack them down and kill them all. That's what he does: He kills people. No warning, no police procedure of any kind, he's merely a vigilantly with a badge; a cowboy in the mold of Jon Wayne.",2008
6,"As we all know the director of training day directed this film and the similarities are evident, from the rising sun and generally to the whole film in nature. However it wasn't unique or better than training day whatsoever. True it would be unfair to compare, but it just leads me to compare. The acting was good, but the crucial thing was their is nothing that separates it and makes it a fantastic film.",2008
3,Street Kings was a complete failure as a film mainly as a result of a almost incoherent story line and cringe-worthy dialogue.,2008
9,"i thought that this was similar to another movie that i seen a few years back with Kurt Russell and Ving Rhames,, Dark Blue,, this one seems to go into so more detail though, and shows us something new that we really haven't seen before, DNA swapping, i thought that Keanu did a great job in this one, Forrest Whitaker on the other hand seemed to be going through the motions, there is a fine supporting cast to back things up, i like the premise of ""Infernal Repair"" investigating our hero Tom on suspicion of corruption along with his superior Jack. Tom's former partner is about to dime him out to internal affairs when tom decides he's had just about enough of Washington, so he follows him to a convenience store to get rid of him, but two drug crazed gunmen are there to beat him to the punch,, but beware noting is as it seems in this movie.",2009
7,"Sometimes in Cinema we see things that get repeated over and over and over again so many times that when something new and fresh comes along, we turn the other cheek because we instantly think that it's going to be the same thing done over.. again. But that's not the case with Street Kings. No Street kings is fresh and exciting and puts a whole new spin on the corrupt cop story that makes this film one of the best crime thrillers to come out since The Departed and Goodfelleas, this film follows a winding and snakish path down one back alley of corruption after another. I wouldn't exactly call it original or anything groundbreaking but this film had a great story to tell and in the short time it had it told it well.",2009
10,"I really wasn't expecting much, other than a few laughs, which would have been OK for a Dreamworks animation movie. But KUNG FU PANDA exceeded all expectations. The story is simple but the execution is superb. It would be really difficult to find something to improve on the production. The voice-overs are really good, esp Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman. The animation is very rich and the colors are crisp and bright. The action sequences are breath-taking. The laughs are mixed in at the appropriate moments. The theater was full and it was composed of a mixture of Adults and young kids. This is a fun for all movie. A testament to this fact is that almost the whole crowd stayed for the end credits. This is a very rare occurrence nowadays.\",2008
9,"Like many others, I saw the ""trailers"" featuring Jack Black. The featurette made me think ""Okay, at least I got to check this out"". Not much more. It didn't make me think ""This is gonna be awesome"" or anything like that.",2008
8,I was almost dreading seeing this movie - we won tickets to the screener and from the first scene I found myself laughing out loud. The movie is so much better than I thought it would be (and that was bad) - I expected the comedy to be slapstick/junior/potty but it wasn't. The story was also good enough to keep my kids focused glued to the screen. The animation is wonderful. Music is tasteful. I can't imagine anyone but Jack Black pulling off the voice though - he definitely made the movie for me. The only thing distracted me was that most of the movie I spent trying to figure out who was doing the voice of Tai Lung (Ian McShane). As mentioned previously in the forums about the pop culture references in this movie - I don't remember one - very nice indeed - it works with some of the other movies but I can do without. This is the first movie in a while I'd like to see again.,2008
10,"After various 3D animated movies ranging from lacklustre ""star"" movies (""Madagascar""), boring tripe (""Shark Tale"", ""Bee Movie""), and over-rated, over-hyped overkill (""Shrek""), Dreamworks can finally be proud of a truly great film. (Sidebar: I actually enjoyed ""Flushed Away"" and ""Over The Hedge"".) First, the bad. If I could complain about ANYTHING it may be a few of the voices. Besides Po, Shifu and Oogway, the rest of the cast seemed pretty 'phoned-in'. Thankfully, those characters are pretty inconsequential so they're not really missed.",2008

10,"From the very beginning, Kung Fu Panda had me practically falling out of my seat --- laughing. It was the perfect blend of comedy, heart, and action, all necessary elements in a successful and great animation/CGI film, in the tradition of The Incredibles and (less action, but containing the heart and laughter) Ratatouille, Finding Nemo and Monsters, Inc.",2008
10,"One of the best comedy movies I've seen, this animation feature is both packed with action and intelligent at the same time. It's yet another variation on ""You can do anything if you believe in yourself"" and carries strong morale and educational message. But the way it's done, the incredible visual side of the story, as well as the dialogs, is just exceptional. You can't but love the fat Panda boy who's dreaming about being the greatest warrior of all China only to wake up to the reality of hawing to serve noodle soup in his father's shop. Unlike his father, who also dreamed but never found the courage to act on it, Panda follows his calling and by ""luck"" get chosen to be the legendary Dragon warrior by the Kung-Fu grand master, the old turtle, to defeat the evil tiger.

The only problem is that Po has no real life experience of kung fu, and his real job is serving noodles at his dad's noodles shop. News of selecting the Dragon Warrior is sent out from the Jade Temple, and the whole city along with Po, go to the celebration. The competition is between the Furious Five: Tigress (voice Angelina Jolie), Viper (voice Lucy Liu), Crane (voice David Cross), Monkey (voice Jackie Chan), and Mantis (voice Seth Rogen). Po accidentally enters the contest and is named the Dragon Warrior. Master Shifu (voice Dustin Hoffman) must find a way to train Po and make him a Kung Fu Master, especially, after they learn that the snow leopard, Tai Lung (voice Ian McShane), is headed their way.",2008
10,"I Love it! The story was great and the background was beautiful, it really felt like an ancient Chinese city. This original story is one of the best since Shrek. And the meaning behind the story may be even better! The story is about Po, an overweight panda who is the son of a noodle maker, who dreams of Po following in his footsteps. But Po longs to be a ninja fighter. Po is as you know is a panda bear and the film's unlikely hero: as the bigger than life and completely lovable bear voiced by the comic genius Jack Black. Po is a Sweet but clumsy, bear who hears the news the ancient and long awaited dragon warrior will be named, so he runs (as much as he can) to hear who will be named at the celebration.",2008

He works in the restaurant of his father specialized in noodles, but he dreams on being a kung fu hero. When Master Oogway summons the population to announce who would be The Dragon Warrior, he surprisingly points out to the slacker Po, frustrating the expectations of Master Shifu and Tigress. Po joins the academy of Master Shifu that does not believe that Po might be The Dragon Warrior. Meanwhile the evil Tai Lung breaks out the high-security prison where he has been arrested for twenty years and heads to the temple of Oogway, expecting to get the Dragon Scroll and becomes more powerful. The Furious Five tries to intercept Tai Lung, but they are defeated. Now the only chance to stop Tai Lung is the glutton Po.",2011
10,"There have been many films about China that the Chinese themselves didn't like. They didn't like Disney's ""Mulan"", they didn't like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". This list goes on. Westerners have westernized the stories or included elements culturally offensive or unintelligible, and humour that, in the Orient, just isn't funny. Well, all that has changed. Last night I went to see Kung Fu Panda in Shanghai (in English with Chinese subtitles). Shangahai is the biggest city in China. The cinema was packed. And from start to finish there was non-stop laughter, excitement, and joy. The humour was universally funny, the culture was dead-on, and the story hit home with the Chinese. They could relate to the characters and their situations. They laughed. They laughed until they cried. Visually, the movie was just beautiful to look at. As an adult, I usually don't enjoy watching cartoons. But this one was more fun I've had at the movies in a long time. The timing of the film's release with the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing coming up is perfect. A job well done to all involved with the making of this little gem!",2008

9,Saw this movie today. It was both entertaining and imbibing good values. For kids a definite watch. For adults too.,2008
8,When you watch Kung Fu Panda you can't help but wonder: why wasn't this done before? Kung fu and CGI make a terrific mix in this entertaining tale of a clumsy fat panda who becomes a true kung fu master. ,2008
10,"It seems like this is a movie made for all the fanboys out there,  regardless of what their obsessions are about. You know, being one who  idolizes certain somebodies or some things, and given a day that Fate  decides to throw you a curveball and give you that one opportunity to  come up close and personal to meet and greet your idol in the flesh, or  be thrown into the exact situation that you've always been dreaming  about. What would you do, and would you go weak in the knees or be  overcome with disbelief that you're actually, finally, realizing your  dream?  Panda Po (voiced by comedian Jack Black) epitomizes exactly that in  Kung Fu Panda, and that struck a chord in me and with many in the  audience as well. And for that, no matter how cliché the story would  become, it had already done its deal and made the connection. It is no  wonder it is rated G here, and I expect that the holiday season would  allow cash registers to ring, for animation fans with the different  styles utilized to tell the story (you must be on time and not miss the  opening sequence), for kung fu fans to get a kick out of classic kung  fu moves personified in their animal forms - Tigress (Angelina Jolie),  Crane (David Cross), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Viper (Lucy Liu) and Monkey  (Jackie Chan) - collectively known as the Fearsome/Fab Five, and for  the kids, given the obvious reason that hey, the protagonist is a  cuddly bear. The marketing department, if not already done, should  stock up on the plush toys, not only of the hero, but the supporting  casts as well. And make their younger forms available too, for they  will sell.  Story-wise, I can't help but to note its tip of its hat towards the  Jackie Chan martial arts movie of the past like Snake in Eagle's  Shadow, Eagle Shadow Fist, etc. The formula which follows a misfit with  weak or zero martial arts background having to undergo harsh training  under a kung fu master, finally realizing his true calling in time to  defeat the villain everybody fears. With the Jackie Chan movies, the  demise of loved one always trigger off a chain reaction, but since this  is G-rated, you won't have the pleasure of having blood spilled, but  with so many splatter-type movies in recent times, I have to admit this  was refreshing, and even having animated animals that talked, didn't  irk me as they are just so lovable here, in their own right.  It's an excellent and very even mix of comedy and drama, even though  they are quite cliché at times if you grew up with the formula, but I  thought that was the point. While the trailers might have given away  some stuff, there are still lots more available which are hidden up the  sleeves, and some minor word replacement such as ""suck"" to ""stink"",  though you would likely be able to stay a step ahead throughout and  even guess whatever secrets the movie have, actually are. For its  stylistic training sequences, they became a throwback and a link to the  fore-mentioned Jackie Chan movies. The fight choreography isn't done  shoddily too with its designing of fights true to the characters'  forms, and integrating them all in a manner rarely seen before. Since  it's an animated flick, it was able to, and probably ramped up  whatever's possible in the kung fu fantasy realm, to give us everything  from rooftop flights to an incredible prison break. It didn't waste any  effort in tapping from the wealth of kung fu material, what with the  various names of deadly moves, secret manuals,  teacher-student feuds, and the best part of it all? Humour being quite  unexpectedly well placed, with more hits than misses to break out into  a hearty laugh by the panda antics.  For all its A-list voice actors in the movie, with the likes of Michael  Clarke Duncan, Dan Fogler, Ian McShane and those who provide voices to  the 5 key animals, Kung Fu Panda is clearly a Jack Black and Dustin  Hoffman vehicle. The bantering between the two is priceless as the  latter plays Sifu (duh) the master teacher, a highly-strung and serious  character who has a past they are shameful about (don't they all). And  as his own teacher Oogway (read: Wu Gui, aka tortoise, voiced by  Randall Duk Kim) advises, herein lies an opportunity for Sifu to  rediscover himself when training possibly the next-big-thing (pardon  the pun) Po, whom he foretold as the mythical Dragon Warrior. So begins  the forging of friendship, long lasting bonds and trust between the  two, even though they got off the wrong footing. And you can probably  feel for Po, because for a fanboy type, having your idols scoff at you  at first opportunity, is actually quite painful.  As a kids movie, there's almost always a message to take away. Here,  it's a reminder to believe in oneself, which I guess is a universal  theme to instill some confidence in the young ones. You might not look  the best, nor are the best amongst your peers, but so long as you have  that attitude to want to learn, that should put you in good steed. As a  summer blockbuster movie, it's fun, thoroughly entertaining, and  doesn't try to be too smart. It's likely to be a crowd pleaser across  all age demographics, and an ultimate popcorn fare, so long as you  manage to keep the popcorn away from the thieving hands of the panda.  And with this release beating local film Kung Fu Gecko to the screens,  I wonder what's the status currently on the Nickson Fong project.",2008
10,"When I watched the trailers to kung fu panda, I scoffed and sneered at the stupidity of a rude panda barging in and demanding to learn kung fu.

They stayed until the HP picture came out! Every scene is so precious and lovely that everyone didn't want to miss it! As a Chinese citizen, my feelings are complicated when I saw that the culture are so nicely expressed on screen by some foreign movie makers, but it's good, isn't it? Chinese movie makers should learn a lot from Hollywood.",2008
10,"I LOVED this movie!!!! I even daresay that this is the best animated motion picture I have seen since ""Cars"" two years ago. Although the whole story of an underdog turned champion is admittedly an oft-told retread, the treatment is original and amazing and very engaging, and not corny (unlike a lot of the recent animated films). I cannot stop singing praises to this one. The artwork of the whole movie is fantastically rendered, no exquisite detail was spared in the scenery, the architecture and of course, the lead animal characters.",2008

Initially I wasn't sure I'd enjoy it as I'm not really into 'talking animal' films; soon I was ignoring that and enjoying the humour and the story. The story itself is hardly new but tat didn't stop it being entertaining. Po is a panda who dreams of becoming a kung fu warrior fighting alongside the greatest warriors in China; unfortunately for him however he seems destined to become a noodle chef! One day the local kung fu master Oogway prophesied that a dangerous former student is going to escape from prison and return to seek his vengeance and steal the scroll that will make him the legendary Dragon Warrior. Oogway decides that he must find a new Dragon Warrior first; to this end he gathers everybody together to appoint the new warrior. Po is desperate to see the ceremony and in his efforts to see finds himself at the centre of the ceremony and being selected himself. Not surprisingly the five greatest warriors and their trainer are not impressed that a fat panda has been selected over them. When their enemy does indeed escape they head off to meet him while master Shifu attempts to train him. As is the way with such films Po finds that he has hidden depths and learns kung fu, the only question is will he learn the secret of the scroll and defeat the dangerous Tai Lung.",2011

7,"I saw Sex Drive at a sneak preview presented by my university. It's a seemingly typical teen sex comedy in the vein of Superbad meets Road Trip. Zuckerman plays Ian, a young virgin with no luck with the ladies, a crush on his childhood friend Felicia (Crew), a jerk of an older brother (Marsden), and is best friends with an Austin Powers-esquire Casanova by the name of Lance (Duke). On the internet, he poses as a football player while courting a mysterious girl online. When the girl invites him to go ""all the way"", he steals his brother's GTO and heads to Knoxville with Felicia and Lance. Ian's character has the usual nerdy teen virgin-in-a-movie problems: falls for the wrong girls, takes few risks, gets caught in embarrassing sexual situations.

It is an instant teen comedy classic, in my books. James Mardsen and Seth Green steals the show but up and coming actors: Josh Zuckerman and Clark Duke did extremely well for themselves and prove themselves to be the next big thing in the future. It is just about as funny than Superbad and American Pie (1,2,3) and the plot of the movie was just so simple and well-made. Hopefully, Sex Drive will be a teen classic in the next few years because it's extremely funny, raunchy & has a little bit of it's sweet side, too. Sex Drive is awesome and super hilarious!!!",2008
7,"Okay, so, Sex Drive: It's rude, it's certainly crude, but is it actually in any way good? That's the question that faces many teenage comedies of similar nature these days; so very often over the past decade, the answer unfortunately has been a resounding and overwhelming 'no', but there always remains a select few reminders that even the dumbest of comedies can still thrive upon just that. Sex Drive is thankfully one of these films. It's outrageous and ridiculous in its portrayal of teenage romance, filled with characters that speak more broadly as caricature than real, definable human beings, but it all works for the most part- in the favour of its silly, edgy routine. Sure enough, it's a film that is far more likely to put a smile on the younger faces of the audience, but that assessment goes without saying; in short, there's some good fun to be had here, but only if you don't mind the gross-out variants of humour and can appreciate the comedy on its own merits. Expect anything more than that, and you'll be disappointed.",2009

This summer 2008 was truly a great time for comedy with movies such as Step Brothers, Tropic Thunder, Pineapple Express, etc. My thoughts were changed though when I saw this movie. This was arguably in the same category as those movies. It is easily one of the funniest movies of 2008. It really reminds you of road movies in the late decade such as Road Trip, Euro Trip, etc. and delivers the normal Superbad kind of content. Josh Zuckerman did a really great job in his first starring role that I have seen him in. Seth Green is in this as well and he nearly delivers a ton of laughs in this movie.

These developments are combined with several road-trip experiences and different (of course, also sexual) experiences during the trip.

I liked all the characters and found this movie highly entertaining. It was a bit like road trip, but with a few more edgier jokes. I think this was way funnier than Superbad, who's humour I found a bit over the top and a bit uncomfortable and is a guys movie. For us girls it was not very funny.",2008

2,"I saw the title and rightfully assumed it was a teen based movie about perhaps losing virginity or having lots of sex, and even though it was rated one out of five stars I was up for at least trying it and seeing whether I would disagree with that opinion, directed by Sean Anders (writer of Hot Tub Time Machine and Mr. Popper's Penguins). Basically in Chicago shy and naive eighteen year old high school senior Ian Lafferty (Austin Powers in Goldmember's Josh Zuckerman) is still a virgin, which is easy for his homophobic brother Rex (James Marsden) to mock, but he has best friends Lance (Clark Duke) who although being a little geeky gets all the women, and beautiful Felicia (Amanda Crew) who has been his friend since childhood but he secretly may love. Ian has been chatting to a girl on the internet called Ms Tasty in Knoxville, Tennessee, and he has been lying on the profile to make him look and sound more confident and manly, they have been chatting a while, and he is surprised when she invites him to see her and sounds happy to ""go all the way"". With the opportunity to have sex and lose his virginity he steals his brother's 1969 Pontiac GTO Judge and plans to drive from Brookfield, Illinois to her, Lance is happy to join him to see him achieve his goal, and Felicia comes with them as well, told that they are visiting Ian's sick grandmother. On the journey they encounter many problems and interesting situations, including hitchhikers that turn hostile, state troopers that put them in a cell, and a night of fun on behalf of farmer Ezekiel (Seth Green) with the Amish community called Rumspringa, where they abandon their beliefs and do whatever they like, but more than anything Ian and Felicia are getting closer. They finally reach their destination, where Rex also catches up, but Ian is allowed to see Ms Tasty (Katrina Bowden) by his brother after claiming he may be gay and having sex with the girl may make him straight again, she does turn up and she is beautiful, but then he realises he loves Felicia. So Ms Tasty threatens him to take his clothes off, and then her psychotic boyfriend Bobby Jo (Dave Sheridan) comes out pointing a gun, and they try to steal Rex's car, and Felicia gets involved in the situation and needs saving, and a small number of earlier characters get involved in the situation, but everything eventually calms down. In the end Lance decides he would prefer the life in the Amish community and to marry beautiful Mary (Alice Greczyn), and Ian and Felicia both realise they love each other and have done for a long time, he loses his virginity with her on New Year's Eve, and Rex comes out as gay after all, we also see the band Fall Out Boy with Ezekiel. Also starring Michael Cudlitz as Rick, Charlie McDermott as Andy and Mark L. Young as Randy. Most of the cast are fine, Zuckerman playing the typical foolish virgin, Duke as an alternative sex pest, Crew being slightly kooky but lovely, and Green as an unusual Amish guy, the story is nothing new, it is essentially another Road Trip, but travelling to have sex and pop the cherry, I agree with the one star out of five rating by critics, it is low on original humour, it was mostly crude and stupid humour, and only the Will They/Won't They? element kept me going, and some kinky stuff, apart from that it is a pointless comedy. Pretty poor!",2012
1,"Female nudity doesn't offend me as male nudity seems to offend a lot of guys.It doesn't offend me to see a naked guy or lady, as long as it enhances the film. I don't use the theater to see naked people .It only bothers me when it's a gimmick, or so called over-the-top joke. The uncut 'Sex Drive' is basically a movie overlapping a soft-porn film (with (mostly) female and some male nudity) and quite frankly, gets old after awhile. Yes, I get the whole ""drinking game"" of taking a shot for every nude person on screen (drunk in 30 minutes or less.) If you have too much time and want to waste it f.e. with old atari games, its one of alternatives o wath this film.",2009
6,"All in all, SexDrive wasn't a bad film. It obviously isn't Oscar-worthy, nor does it even stand out amongst its peers (while far stronger than College, it is on the same plain or perhaps a bit lower than Nick and Norah's). I entered this film with high hopes for it had a very strong trailer as witnessed before Tropic Thunder. ",2008
2,"What is the matter with people here? This movie is a complete train wreck from start to finish! Even Seth Green couldn't drag this film up into the realms of good humour. The main cast is pretty damn bad, and some sort of failed attempt at creating another American Pie bunch of kids, plus the story is boring and goes nowhere. You can spot the moments that the creators thought were particularly funny, as they are pushed right into your face much harder than the rest of the drivel, but this just makes those moments all the more embarrassing for not being funny at all.",2009
4,"In sight that the main trilogy of American Pie was destroyed by the repulsive sequels made straight-to-DVD which had nothing to do with the sharp tone of the first three films,the producers of Sex Drive took an opportunity and they used it,trying to show the rude humor and over the top characters which made the first American Pie film memorable.And although they surpassed the level of mischief and bad taste from that film,they fell short on the emotional and funny aspects.Sex Drive is a very bad juvenile comedy which bored me very much and did not make me laugh with one or two exceptions.There is not one cliché which is not used in Sex Drive or scenes which we have never seen on another movies : the embarrassing sexual situation discovered by the parents of the main character,the intolerable older brother who tortures him (James Marsden representing the only good element from this movie...I think he was the one who made me laugh on the previously mentioned exceptions),the younger brother who has more experience than the rest of the characters and the predictable ending in which happiness is nearer than what all the characters think.With the exception of Marsden,all the actors are anonymous and completely unfunny...they never put enthusiasm to their characters.The worst element from this movie is that it is not funny,specially if you have seen all the sexual juvenile comedies which were made after the success of American Pie.I cannot explain to myself how this movie got a release on cinemas,when it deserved to be one of those pathetic juvenile comedies made straight-to-DVD (like Cougar Club,Pledge This,Dorm Daze and other ones which I have fortunately forgotten).So,I suggest you to avoid this enormously boring and unfunny juvenile comedy because this is not worthy of your time and your money.",2009
1,"First I want to admit that I joined IMDb just so I could write that ""Sex Drive"" is probably one of the three worst films I've ever seen in my life, third only to ""Going Overboard"" with Adam Sandler, and maybe ""Cabin Fever"". Second, I really don't even have that much free time to waste on such a frivolous pursuit, but I hated this movie so much I really couldn't help myself. I'm at a loss to think of one redeeming quality anywhere in this film. From the blatant and unimaginative Stifler rip-off to the stupid, unattractive, dweeby male characters who think that if they're assholes, they'll get the chicks, this piece of work is a real piece of garbage, or vice versa. I get it. It's just a movie! Sure, but the problem is this type of movie is made specifically for and marketed directly to the dumbasses who think these characters' actions are funny and cool, and consequently emulate them. And what's with all the gay and dick references? After about two minutes of this crap fest it couldn't have been more obvious that the writer, director, producers, etc., are totally gay, and there's not one thing funny about it. Furthermore, what could have been at least one redeeming quality – the abundant use of a 1969 Pontiac GTO Judge, one of the coolest cars ever built – only served to incense me that much more because in short order I sat in genuine horror as I watched this awesome car being driven through corn fields and jumped, a la ""The Dukes of Hazzard"", over ditches and the like. Jesus, what a heart-breaking and shameful waste. There's not much worse than a writer, director, or producers who will trash a car like this just because they can. I won't even get into all the stupid and non-humorous plot points related to the Amish: how terribly un-funny. Blech! Save your time and money. I wish I could give myself a lobotomy so I could forget what I've just seen. I couldn't hate this movie more!",2010
9,"1st of all anyone who didn't laugh out loud at least once ( that's really pushin it real good) in this movie has no sense of humor and possibly no soul. Sure there is gross Out humor, some nudity, extreme language a a tightly followed unexpected plot line and twists. Oh wait, last time I checked those are all great characteristics of a team comedy. The storyline divulged deep into each character and even played with emotions enough for you to love each character or hate to love each character. The over the top humor isn't the same old stuff, but well placed, well delivered (especially Seth green and Clark duke), and carefully thought out in the script. If your looking for the best laugh out loud comedy of 2008, take a Sexdrive! ",2008
6,"Since this film was a comedy let's look at it in that light first. I saw this movie about a week ago and it had about two hilarious moments which I am having a hard time remembering. The rest of the film most of the audience sat there in silence, with sporadic giggles throughout. My friends whom I watched the pre-screening with said they were amused in general but didn't find the film very funny. This is probably because this film strongly uses clichés and old ideas that have just been reshuffled with relatively little originality. ",2008
6,"Pretty much everything has been done before in teen sex comedies and the creators of Sex Drive know it. To counteract the expected clichés they have reversed the roles of a few of the stereotypical characters and intensified the vulgar events, but sadly we've seen this story, these characters, and these gags before. More often than not it's still funny, but any originality has been all but lost.",2008

He tells her he has a 1969 GTO (his brother's) and she says if he drives to see her in Knoxville, she'll make it worth his while. The plot sounds normal for a raunchy teen comedy, but it's pulled off hysterically. It probably couldn't have without the perfect cast.",2009

9,"Vicky (a neurotic and sexy Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (a neurotic and gorgeous Scarlett Johansson) are two American tourists in Spain examining their differing views on love in Woody Allen's breezy and alluring ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"". Amidst a tempestuous summer in Barcelona, the ladies are both seduced by a free-thinking painter (a perfect Javier Bardem) whose own life is complicated by his still passionate relationship with his ex-wife (a devastating Penelope Cruz, who has never looked more beautiful).",2008
9,"I just got back from a free screening of this movie. Wonderful, brilliant, thought provoking, funny, great story in the way only Woody Allen could do. The acting was great, the writing was great, the story was great. As well as the fact that it wasn't a poor rehash of Crimes and Misdemeanors like Match Point and Cassandra's Dream. So refreshing on all levels. Javier Bardem embodies the character and truly allows me to forget about his role in Old Country. Patricia Clarkson, a gem as always. The girls were all great. Had not been impressed with Scarlett Johansson since Lost in Translation and was bored with her work in the last of his films but she held her own and did the part great. Penélope Cruz was wonderful, vibrate and funny especially when doing the Spanish. At 71 the man still has it and has rehashed the place in my heart where I hold his wonderful art. Simply happy and fulfilled. Thank you Woody!",2008
8,"Barcelona is recognizable enough and exotic enough to frame the latest complication from Woody Allen. Allen himself claims to care very little about films. He doesn't consider them the center of his life. Strange, because I do, Woody Allen without his films is...well I don't know who or what he is. Here he ventures again outside New York in a shape and form that reminded me a little bit of Jacques Rivette. Scarlet Johansson and Rebecca Hall, as the blond and the brunette of the title, make a great pair of opposites or seemingly so. Javier Bardem is the artist that comes to ruffle their world and the spectacular Penelope Cruz (getting better and better with every movie) is the hysterical side of the artist's past. We spend a great deal of time sitting at tables eating and drinking while a voice over guide us through their physical and emotional journey. I was delighted, entertained ever aroused. Woody Allen keeps surprising and he's got it whether he cares about it or not.",2008
7,"Vicky Christina Barcelona isn't quite the work of genius that several critics are making it out to be, but it is Woody Allen's most solid film in nearly a decade and by far his sexiest.",2008
2,"There were three things that bothered me about this movie. 1) Woody Allen, whose controversial relationships are well-documented, has created a movie promoting a judgment free world where people should do as they please with their relationships. Nothing wrong with that, but why does he need to put down conventional lives and relationships in order to do so? He mocks conventional life styles as mundane and torturous. Two male characters are negatively portrayed because of their huge sin: being boring (gasp!). You would think that a man whose movies are found to be boring by 95% of the population would be sensitive towards that label.",2009
2,"First of all i would like to say that I'm a big fan of the old woody Allen , i mean the great director/writer woody Allen , who created in over thirty years in the business some of the most romantic , funny . dramatic , masterpieces that shined in Hollywood starting from Annie Hall , to Hannah and her sisters , Mighty Aphrodite , and last but not least Sweet and lowdown . But the new woody Allen has produced many unbalanced , mildly funny , and romantically dead movies such as Melinda and Melinda which was acceptable , but not a woody Allen material , Hollywood Ending which wasn't so bad as well but wasn't good either , and this year his latest film came out and i had mixed feeling about it , i was frightened that another disappointing movie from the master Allen could destroy my love to his earlier masterpieces , and unfortunately , it was even more disappointing than i could ever imagine . ",2009
3,"To be true, I really enjoy Woddy Allen's work. When I heard that this film was on making the first thing I thought was «gotta see it». And to be sincere too, I was very disappointed for the results. ",2008
9,"Vicky Cristina Barcelona is among the cream of the Woody Allen crop, in the midst of Annie Hall, Manhattan, Hannah and Her Sisters and Match Point. It may even be a wiser film than any of them. What Woody has done throughout his film career is seek the answers to his own life questions in any number of ways. Some later films contradict the philosophical implications of previous ones. Some reaffirm them. His foremost theme has always been the complications of love and sex, and this ultimately genre-less film that I suppose could be considered a romantic seriocomedy may be his magnum opus of his sexual and romantic revelations.",2008
2,"Some have commented about the use of a narrator. Yes, that was lazy and intrusive, but not nearly the worst part of this boring mess of a film. And I wouldn't care if Woody Allen wasn't the director and writer - at this point I just watch films for what they are, not who was involved in making them. I found myself trying to stay awake while watching it, but when it had my full attention, I found myself amazed at the flimsiness being presented. Boring, self-indulgent people walking around a beautiful city, not knowing what they really wanted out of life, not really interested in anyone or anything else, except for what it meant to themselves.",2008
2,"""Vicky Christina Barcelona"" will be praised by the few remaining Woody Allen fans and condemned by the rest of us, whose model for drama is derived from classic Greek theater. The demands for statement of circumstance, a crescendo of conflict rising to a crisis, a resolution of the crisis, and a brief concluding summary are missing from VCB. The convention of character change -- Othello changing into a wife murderer, Hamlet deteriorating into madness, Scout's discovery of important life values in ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" -- is also missing. The usual expectation that minor characters are introduced into a story if they have some purpose, is ignored. And of course, the common convention of a plot, as opposed to a vignette, is nowhere on the horizon. The extensive use of anonymous voice-over narration does not salvage this wreck and only leaves the audience annoyed and patronized.",2009
9,"When Match Point came out in 2005, I was impressed, but no blown away like most of the public and critics. I thought it was an interesting movie that dealt with dark issues, but it didn't feel like Woody Allen. Scoop was a cute movie, but felt like fluff.",2008
1,"Throughout the years I've become less interested in Woody Allen's work and if this is his worst film I quite hope it is. I wouldn't have remembered about it, if it wasn't for a phone conversation I had with a friend short after I saw the film (Vicky Cristina Barcelona was on ARTE France/Germany). The beginning of the movie is a bit bland and uninspiring, but good enough in the middle of a boring evening. So I think: – it's about time you watch a Woody Allen film again! A male narrator voice explains the events on the screen in terse sentences; as I continue to watch I become more intrigued, and halfway though I even forgive the lousy tourist ride around Barcelona (thou I never was in Barcelona, the film doesn't tell me anything I already know about the city). I remain motionless seated on the couch with my eyes open (longing for a change of scenery), in case there's more to it. And then suddenly -it- happens! Maria Elena (Penélope Cruz) holding a gun (imitating Allen's neurotic gimmicks) tries to blast away her love Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem)... what? do I hear the narrator voice again? oh, the blow of mercy – yes, the narrator's voice comes on again and announces with pathetic contrivance that Vicky (Rebecca Hall) returns home to have her grand wedding to Doug (Chris Messina)... Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) continues searching... maybe Allen just had enough and needed an easy way out to end the movie. Mr. Woody Allen, I'll go to your movies, but you'll have to seduce me.",2010
2,"Vicky Christina Barcelona may be the laziest movie I have ever seen. Not necessarily the worst movie ever, but I don't think I have ever seen so many talented people put in so little effort (with the exception of Penelope Cruz). I mean, I fully understand why Woody Allen would want to spend several weeks in Barcelona with three beautiful women, but I don't know why he bothered to put film in the camera and call it a movie. ",2011
4,"The problem with VCB is that, about half-way into the movie, we are presented with such an over the top, unrealistic scenario, that the only people that could possibly buy it are people that have no experience dealing with real women in the real world. This scenario begins the moment that Javier brings his mentally ailing ex-wife Maria into his house, which he already shares for the time being with current girlfriend Cristina. Cristina is somewhat perplexed. Javier explains that Maria will have to stay with them for a little while. How long? Javier explains, ""a few...months"". Believe it or not, Cristina, though intitally frustrated and angry, accepts the arrangement.",2008
4,"When will Woody Allen get over his ridiculous obsession with the pretentious rich? It used to be that he wrote for the masses, albeit the educated, urbane masses. So maybe he just needs to get back to his New York roots (again), but for the love of Gene Shalit, could he please stop turning in such bland crap? Does anyone else remember when Allen had a real knack for snappy dialog? For characters who seemed as real as the veins on your hand? When his movies were clever, not predictable? When each movie contained a rich, vibrant atmosphere that drew from both negative and positive aspects of The Big Apple? Or did I dream about all of those movies? Vicky Cristina Barcelona is a big dud. It's about a love/lust pentagon that involves titular friends (Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johannson), on vacation in the titular town, who encounter Bohemian painter Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem). But Vicky's engaged to a sanctimonious tool (Chris Messina), and then Juan Antonio's unstable ex-wife (Penelope Cruz) shows up as well. And it being Spain, everyone's got lust on the brain, and there's plenty of partner swapping.",2008
1,"I watched this movie based on the IMDb score for this movie. I always like Woodys earlier work, and hoped this might be a decent film. How wrong I was...",2009
2,"Here's a word I despise using in reviews: boring. But, I seriously can't avoid describing 'Vicky Christina Barcelona' as just that: boring. Probably because I've never been a Woody Allen fan. Well, you're either a Woody Allen fan or not, an Adam Sandler fan or not, a Jim Carrey fan or not, or even a Stanley Kubrick fan or not. (Personally, only of the ones mentioned, I'm only a Carrey fan, but only for about 70% of his films.) 'Vicky' seems just to be a simple story of two different, but best gal friends on holiday in Spain who both get seduced by a completely lost, and drama-followed painter (Bardem.) We learn of their loves/likes/dislikes and definitely unhappy lifestyles they either are leading or will live. Everyone is lost, unhappy or despicable. Barely a character will think twice about having an affair, a destructive threesome or someone else's feelings. In fact, the only character you feel for, or maybe supposed to care about is Chris, the finance/husband of Vicky, much like John C. Reilly's character, Amos, in 'Chicago'  both Amos and Chris are the only respectable characters/spouses in their movies and both are completely oblivious and naïve. Yet, we get to watch them get lied to, stomped on and kept in the dark throughout. Granted, both title characters did what they could with the material they were given, but the real reason I watched was for all the Oscar buzz concerning Penelope Cruz. Yes, she was good. Great? Not really. My vote still leans towards Marisa Tomei in 'The Wrestler.' And you have to stammer through the first 50 out of 96 minutes to finally see Cruz. Aside from her performance, I'm not surprised no other nominations were handed out. Oh, yeah, they were probably just as bored as I was.",2009
8,"Principled monogamists may not like this film. Not only does it show its primary characters in relationships with multiple partners but, with one exception, they are quite open with each other about it. Allen suggests both that romantic happiness is best achieved with more than one person and that it is necessarily ephemeral (I wonder what his young wife, Soon-Yi Previn, thinks). He says in a Los Angeles Times interview with Rachel Abramowitz that Vicky Cristina Barcelona is, ultimately, ""a very sad film."" ",2008
2,"I've mostly stayed away from Woody Allen movies from the last 20 years because my few forays into things he's done in that time (Anything Else, Manhattan Murder Mystery) were not pleasant. Add Vicky Cristina Barcelona to the pile of unpleasantness. This movie is bad. I can't understand the folks who raved about it and gave it a 10. ",2010
1,"I don't understand the raves this movie is getting. The only masterpiece Woody Allen ever made was ""Manhattan."" Even ""Annie Hall"" got too coy and cute for me. The early comedies were sublime because he had a sense of humor about himself. I had high hopes for ""Vicky, Christina, Barcelona,"" (principally because I knew Allen wouldn't be in it playing the usual old lech who thinks he's irresistible to a much younger starlet). However, I found the dialogue banal, the sense of drama non-existent and the narrator beyond annoying. The humor, if there was any, passed me by. The reviews called it ""sun-drenched,"" but at least at the theatre in which I saw it, the picture was murky and out-of-focus at best. Most tedious movie I've seen in years, a huge disappointment. Maybe if the whole thing had been in Spanish?",2008
2,"This is unfortunately by far the worst movie made by W. Allen , indisputably one of the greatest masters of comedies , and one of my most favorite directors , actors , writers , but this movie simply falls flat on every count , namely , what the heck is it even about ?

1,"This film left me scratching my head. As so many others have pointed out in these posts, the characters, without exception, are self-indulgent, spoiled, unlikeable hedonists who occupy their own tiny, self-absorbed worlds.

2,Who are these people? do they exist anywhere? What are they for? What do they live on? why is anyone who actually works for a living depicted as a schmuck? Who talks like this? What purpose is there in making a film about them? How can a purportedly intelligent filmmaker reference Spanish identity and yet present the country (especially Barcelona) as a series of banal tourist postcards and cultural clichés? Does Woody Allen now live totally in his imagination? What's the intended audience for this unreal farrago? When are talented actors going to realise that adding a modern Woody Allen film to their CV is a negative? When am I going to stop watching Woody Allen films in the hope that he'll rediscover a relevant muse - or even the ability to entertain?,2009
3,"The film opens with a steady flow of stereotypes and despite the expectations of Woody Allen fans, continues with them to the very end. Let's have painters... because they are so romantic and passionate. Let's have Spaniards... because they are hot-blooded and beautiful.

Whereas the original warned of the dangers of nuclear armament, this modern update boldly chides us for being mean to each other and not taking care of the environment.

No guards in the room? Never happen. 4. The military decides to enclose GORT in giant steel panels. They built these in a matter of hours? How? Where? 5. After enclosing him, he is lowered into some underground laboratory that appears custom-made for him. Where did that come from? How did they get him there? 6. They break a diamond drill on GORT and say it will take 24 hours to fix. The boss barks ""Fix it now""!. They send in a poor schlub who promptly screws on a new drill bit. Then the sucker dies. 7. Klaatu meets with another of his kind who has lived among us for 70 years and apparently become quite fond of us. Why didn't he convince the rest of the aliens not to destroy humanity? He came to the same conclusion that Klaatu eventually reaches. 8. The ""swarm"" is destroying everything man-made in its path. We see it destroy Giants Stadium in a matter of seconds. Then it is in Central Park. Why aren't all the buildings in Manhattan falling down? Klaatu hasn't done anything to stop them up to this point. Oh--I could go on and on. Then there are all of the plot clichés; Good scientist resists evil government. Frustrated step-mom/ disconnected stepson find redemption through love of dead father/husband. Boo hoo hoo. Stupid general fires all his big guns at indestructible alien. You know what's going to happen. Yup, general gets destroyed/vaporized/eaten.

5,"Let's be blunt: this is definitely not a good movie; it's not horrid either, it's just somewhere between average and bad. There are quite a few problems. First, with the script, which tries to incorporate all elements of the 1951 movie into a new, updated whole. The end result lacks cohesion and plays more like a sequence of 5 to 10 minutes scenes badly sewn together, the prime objective of each scene being either to introduce an element taken from the original movie or, on the contrary, an idea absent form the1951 original, instead of simply advancing the story. Second, the direction: poor, poor, poor. Third, some of the worst acting I have seen in a mainstream movie for a long time; I found the leads, especially Keanu, quite good but the other actors are decent at best, with Katie Bates delivering a frighteningly catastrophic 'performance'. I was not shocked (positively or negatively) by all the other aspects of the film.",2008
1,The Day the Earth Stood Still is an utterly pointless movie remake. The original - and I'll pause here for everyone who's never seen it to roll their eyes - is one of the best sci-fi films of all times. This modern telling keeps only the names of the characters and abandons everything else.,2008

That's me, I guess; the eternal optimist, thinking one day Hollywood will see the error of their ways. I'm starting to think there's a greater chance of aliens landing in Manhattan though. You don't take a highly regarded classic like THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL and update it for no reason other than to make a few bucks. Sure, you can pretend there is purpose; you can cash in on the current environmental crisis fears by insinuating that aliens have come to earth to save the planet from the horrifically unappreciative human race.

I had read many of the comments about this movie and wanted to see for myself what the negative buzz was about. I was tremendously surprised at how much I liked this movie. I think a couple of things may have misled viewers because of the coming attractions of this film. It seems like folks were probably expecting the robot GORT to go around destroying cities and being a general baaaadasss character. But what DTSS turned out to be was a really good sci-fi movie. You have to really pay attention to the dialog to get the full jist of this tricky film. For Klaatu never really has any love or care for humanity. Their goal is to wipe mankind off the face of this planet to allow other forms of life to exist as well as future beings from other worlds. And pay close attention to what he says near the end of the film when he decides to stop humankind's extinction. He said it will cost you something. It's a tricky line, but if you follow it and watch the end of the film you'll understand why the Earth stands still. I won't piece it together for everyone...see if you can figure it out. I love this movie for it's smartness. Many have complained about this being another special effects, mindless mess. It is not.

It's a terrific sci-fi film, probably the best to come out of the 50's era. I highly recommend it; moving onto the, sigh, remake. Keanu Reeves, mmmm, what on Earth about him scream alien? I guess since it looks like it hurts when his face expresses human emotion, he's what the director needed. But what I didn't appreciate about the remake is that it completely changed the story and the moral the first movie brought to us. If we were to have a remake of this story, at least it seems like in today's world it moral is more important than ever, that humans are just destroying themselves with all the technology and violence that we have created. Instead, I get 2 hours of Jennifer Connelly complaining to a stubborn Keanu Reeves on how much humans rock.",2009
4,"Laughter makes the almost two hours not a total loss. But I don't think, somehow, that ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" was meant as a comedy. They must have realize however, that having John Cleese as the scientist was bound to provoke some giggles. Keanu Reeves is priceless as the wooden, expressionless alien. A great, unintentional, comic creation. Kathy Bates, in pantsuits if you please, plays the American Secretary of Defense and the whole thing doesn't have a single ingredient of the elements that made the Robert Wise original one of the classics of its genre. The visual tricks are good but repetitive and rather confusing. I must admit I wasn't bored I was just puzzled.",2008
3,"I am not one who is against remakes in principle, not even remakes of really good films. The Day the Earth Stood Still is, as far as I see it, a prime candidate for remake. It would be easy to update this story to comment on current times. Modern audiences, after all, are very little effected by the Cold War anymore. The makers of this new version do, in fact, attempt to relate their film to modern affairs. The alien visitor, instead of interfering over Earth's nuclear ambitions, comes to out planet in order to stop us from destroying our environment. That's a perfectly acceptable updating. Unfortunately, as is the problem with most remakes, The Day the Earth Stood Still '08 has the unmistakable aura of having been made for a quick buck. You remember there's a classic called this? Throw us a few bucks, and you won't have to sit through it in black and white anymore! And there'll be a couple explosions! It all feels so rushed and sloppily thrown together. Scenes contradict each other, little of the plot makes any sense. The visual effects are wildly uneven. Gort in particular is a computer generated monstrosity that looks like he's been imported straight from a Nintendo 64 game. Pretty much all of the actors don't seem to want to be there, and almost all of them give abysmal performances. We expect that from Keanu Reeves, but when Jennifer Connelly, who gives it her all even in junk like Hulk, phones it in, you should realize your project has little merit. The entire film is poorly paced and frequently stilted. It never works.",2008
7,"Frankly, the film can impress me.",2008
5,That kid ruined a movie that might have been okay. There was no reason to constantly hear his wining and back-stabbing. It really ruined a movie that was just hanging onto me by a thread. I really wanted that kid to just die at the end of the movie. Everything about him was awful.,2008
10,"I think people are missing the message within this film, saying it has none, it's an insult to the original, but they're all wrong. BOTH movies have a great message, and both are true. In the original version Klaatu comes to Earth to warn humanity of its violent nature and that they need to change. It seems to me that those who have reviewed this movie and said it has no message whatsoever obviously weren't watching the movie but more so looking for reasons to hate it. First off, with any remake or adaptation you shouldn't compare it to the original, it'll make you hate it. Like with the Spiderman movies, so many people hated those simply because it wasn't like the comics. Hello? NONE of the comic book movies are that close to the comics! In any case, the reason why they changed the movie's message for this version is because of the time we're living in. Yes it's obvious we're still a very violent race, but this version is expressing the message which the majority of humanity has STILL been ignoring! GLOBAL WARMING!!!! It's why in this version the aliens have a weapon which destroys humanity and any of their creations while the other races of Earth remain protected in an orb which acts like an ark. Oh well, guess people are going to ignore it still until it's too late. But as the professor said in this movie, humanity will change once it's at the brink of destruction.",2008
10,I'm surprised at some of the comments to say the least. I do realise that I'm the overwhelming minority by saying this but I thought the film was absolutely brilliant.,2008
1,"This film is lost, lost, lost, and going nowhere. It has been misconceived, has no point, is overdone like a burnt steak, and just think of all the money they wasted on producing this rambling, directionless, self-indulgent failure. Strangely enough, I rather liked the central performance by Keanu Reeves as the visiting alien. Some people might say it was wooden and inexpressive. But it was chillingly convincing, and more or less the way an alien of that sort would act (I know several, they come from a rival planet, and would never be allowed on mine). I actually admired the sturdy determination of Reeves to maintain continuity of mood throughout this mayhem, where crazy things were happening all around him and he had to put up with Jennifer Connelly and her obnoxious, thoroughly revolting brat. Why on earth (even if it were standing still) did anyone choose Jennifer Connelly for the role of the woman? (One cannot call her the 'love interest' because Keanu Reeves, as an alien with no expression, is above such things, or below them, or whatever.) Even when they are trapped in a car on long dangerous drives, looking at each other meaningfully, the meaning has nothing to do with males and females but more to do with dogs and cats. Connelly looks haunted, but for the wrong reasons. She seems not to have slept in ten years. She really should take a holiday and freshen up. Why are her eyes so sunken and tired? She does not add any zip to the action, she makes us want to go have a nap or we will look like her. Reeves has never looked better, even when he was a young buck with doe eyes (is that a contradiction?) The DVD of this film offers us the original film starring Michael Rennie as an extra. 'Oldies but goodies!' Bring back the days when they knew how to make a science fiction film properly for only a tiny budget and impress the hell out of us! The worst thing about the film is the appalling son of Jennifer Connelly. I don't want to mention the unfortunate boy actor's name, I just want to point out that the whole thing stinks. What is this obsession they have in Hollywood with putting disgusting children in every film who then have to be worshipped by cringeing, apologetic, neurotic parents? Is it because all parents are now cringeing and neurotic? Or all children have now become that offensive, sneering, sulky, and arrogant? And has anyone noticed that Connelly is as white as parchment while her 'son' is, well, what shall I say? I don't want to commit a 'hate crime' by pointing out that he differs rather extremely in hue. As we all know, we aren't permitted anymore to mention any skin colour other than white without getting arrested. But isn't this carrying black tokenism in films to insane extremes? What a mess. Further comment about this meandering, unfocused, pointless exercise in cinematic vanity would be an offense to those electrons who sacrifice their lives to appear on our computer screens. Or should I now say those liquid crystals who offer themselves for annihilation on the altar of a potassium carbonate plastic glass, so that we may all read and write in cyberspace? This is a sci fi review, after all. (And as for the plague of metal locusts in the film, come on! Let's get unreal!)",2009
10,"...I'm actually really enjoying this series (as of episode 4). I started watching Legend of the Seeker knowing that I was signing up for extreme fantasy, and must say it's very entertaining. It is a huge call to pay off a story of this scale every week without looking embarrassingly cheap, especially with all the special effects required. To the show's credit, it embraces what it is and delivers an unusually high standard for television. ",2008
8,"I bought Wizard's First Rule the day it was released in 1994, simply because of the great cover art and my love for new, good fantasy books. What I got was my favorite fantasy series of all time, including Tolkien and Jordan. I am a published author myself, as well as having a profile on this website. I am an avid reader of classic literature since 1975, especially fantasy. So, written above, is my claim to believability.",2008
9,"I heard about this series by a friend that said ""Just don't read the comments before you see it"". Of course, that was the very first thing I did, and let me tell you how afraid was after I read them!! I though this series was going to suck big time, but had to see it by myself and guess what - I loved it! OK, it's not phenomenal, but it's quite good. I was kept interested, the photography was awesome, the costumes, too. I've only just seen the first two, but I sure am going to see the others and if they continue like this I'll be a fan. I'm not sure if I'd would of liked it had I read the books that this series is based on, but I think I would have. I've always been good at separating the books from their interpretations to the theater or television. When I watched ""Legend of the Seeker"" I watched the show for itself and therefore I enjoyed it very much. It's good entertainment for a fantasy series and I was actually quite surprised by the excellent performance of the actress Bridget Regan.",2008
8,"I for one think it is great to have something like this on television. Good versus evil with the trio cast here is fun to watch. The special effects are terrific, and I like how the episodes are going. I love the wizard, the Seeker is awesome, and the Confessor makes my husband want to watch! Love it! Keep it coming!",2008
9,"When I first heard about the TV series, I knew it was an adaptation of a book. At first, I didn't want to watch it thinking that the TV series is surely not as good as the book. Of course. Surprisingly it is charming and captivating to watch. It is like an addiction, you want to watch it again and again.",2008
8,"So how is the Legend of the Seeker? What do people think so far? Looking at the comments we get a load of onestars from people saying it doesn't follow the books to the letter, people that can't understand how Goodkind could ""sell his soul to Hollywood"" (really... wow), and people that make untrue claims about inaccuracies in the TV-series apparently without having watched it themselves.

9,"I loved this show, I catch is by chance on the CW this past Sunday (saw the third and forth episodes) and was instantly hooked. I missed having a great adventure, swords blazing, fantasy including and hero adoring show on TV. I immediately looked up the first two episodes that I missed online and watched them. ",2008
1,"Big fan of novels I want to put that out there first. Second, I watched the first episode and this is pure crap. I cant believe how horribly someone could be allowed to take a story and just change everything. It would seem they tried at every step to not follow easy guidelines as to how this story is supposed to be. Biggest disappointment in a television series in history, and now i fear they will never actually film something again similar to the novels. If I were to try and ignore for a possible second the awesome stories i read and rate this series as it were i would still say utmost pour. I am just glad I spent no money on watching this show, and hope like hell some one slaps the stupid out of this director and tries to reclaim this novel in a film or series. By the way the actor playing Richard is a pansy. Kahlan is pretty hot, she alone gets the 1 star rating that at minimum everything gets. Good day.",2012
10,"Legend of the Seeker is action packed, there is romance, magic, stunning locations, great cast and movie quality special effects. This is the best show on TV. If it is given proper promotion and permanent time slot it will be a huge hit!!! So many people are just finding out about the show and are falling in love with it. I just happened to run across it one Saturday afternoon by chance during season 1 and was immediately hooked. It is now the only ""must watch"" on TV for me. I bought Season 1 as soon as it came out and have ordered Season 2. This show is epic and deserves to go on. I have read the books and love the series. I know it doesn't follow the books exactly, however I have yet to see ANY book brought to the screen (big or small) that does. I am not a fan of the so-called ""reality"" shows. I have enough reality in my own reality. Give me Fantasy and take me away for awhile. This show is perfect. We need to have Seasons 3,4,5...",2010

The book happened to pop in my mind and I decided to check Goodkind's site to see if any new books were coming out (related or unrelated to SoT). I found out about the show yesterday (it probably been out for a year) and went to bed thinking, ""im going to wake up tomorrow and catch up on every episode""...that's how stoked I was.

1,"Wizard's First Rule is a gripping novel. Every single chapter is full of action and suspense. There are numerous plot twists and surprising moments, and it deals with serious issues and universal problems which apply to the real world.

1,This series is what all fans of great books dread.,2008
1,"Yes I know Hollywood can not keep everything that is in a book that gets optioned, but come on ""Legend Of The Seeker"" is a joke. First they made Zedd look, act, and feel stupid! Second when Kahlan uses her confessor magic, in the episode I saw, she faints WTF!!! Third the Sword Of Truth can cut threw anything, in the episode I watched Richard draws the Sword Of Truth and there is no distinctive sound of the sword leaving its scabbard or Richard cutting threw any and all adversary's it was like it was just any ordinary sword not a sword of magic. Hollywood took way to many liberty with this series and should never be able to option any kind of book ever again if they can't stick to the story thats already there!!!!!!!!!!",2008
3,"Now I am truly disappointed, this ""T.V. series"" does not follow the books, it has similarities, but the main character is not what one would expect of Richard, and ""Zedd"" does not appear as one would have guessed from the books, and the ""Seeker"" was on meant to seek and find the truth in all matters, and ""Richard"" was the one who knew and talked to ""Zedd"". ""Richard's"" father was dead at the start of the book, ""Richard's"" mother was married to ""George"" and ""Zedd"" was his grandfather, Terry Goodkind has truly fallen. ""Richard"" had been bitten by the snake vine when the book started, and found ""Kahlan"" on a rocky trail on a cliff, not a cliff at the end of a forest. She did not try and kill him, and he took here to ""Zedd's"" house not the night wisp, which died soon after the trip across the border.",2008
1,"Couldn't they even come close to the books? This is horrible. I got excited because they come close in the minor detail but then they blow the major details. I really tried to view this as something different, but if you read the books the show is really bad. They completely changed the entire basis. Zed was Richards friend from the beginning. Later you find out he is Zed's grandson. This completely ruins that. Best thing I can say about this is it is better than the movie Battlefield Earth. This is my favorite series of books (author blew the last one, but on the whole is a great series). Really want to get thru the show to see how they did the Mord Sith portion, but I just cant do it.",2009
1,"OK, I also have never read the book so i can't comment on how accurate the series is to the book. However, if Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles were made to series and had mutilated the characters and the main concepts of the book, I would be mortified and disgusted!!

When I first learned that ABC had purchased the rights to adapt the series for television, I was almost drooling at the potential such a series could have, even after being edited down for content and time constraints. Tack on the fact that Sam Raimi would be involved in the production and I wasn't going to miss it for the world.",2009

6,"Let me just say that I'm 19, a guy, and straight, and DAMN was I having a great time watching The House Bunny. To sum it up, THB is basically an Adam Sandler movie for girls, with Anna Faris breathing life into an otherwise flat movie with her uncanny comic ability and unbeatable charm. In short, she makes the movie watchable, and in some moments, likable and entertaining.",2008
7,"Anna Faris makes this paper thin attempt at comedy overwhelmingly worthwhile. She is an original that reminded me of some other glories, from Carole Lombard to Goldie Hawn. Her innocence is so believable that we go with her wherever she decides to go. I wish the producers and responsible for this movie getting made had gone all the way and provided this extraordinary comic talent with a more substantial script and direction giving her the opportunity to shine even more than she shines here and here shine she does, big time. Just look at her listening, trying to make sense of what's happening around her. Deeply moving, very funny, kind of unique. I hope she soon finds her Garson Kanin and her George Cukor. I have the feeling we ain't seen nothing yet",2008

7,"Shelley (Anna Faris) was abandoned as a baby on someone's doorstep long ago. As she relates, no one was interested in getting her back although they did request that the basket be returned! Shuttled from one orphanage to another, Shelley eventually found a ""family"" when her womanish figure came into fruition. That's right, Shelley resided in the Playboy mansion and found happiness with Hef and the other gal pal housemates. However, one day Shelley receives word that Hef has given her two hours to move out of the mansion. A fellow worker at the residence suggests that, perhaps, she is getting too old to be a bunny. After all, didn't she just turn 27? And, isn't that like 59 in ""bunny years""? So, off Shelley goes, hurt and scared. After a day on her own, she stumbles onto a nearby college campus and learns that she could possibly find a job, a home, and a salary by becoming a sorority ""mother"" to a group of misfit sisters. These gals, the Zetas, have seen their numbers shrink, mostly because they are all shy and a bit unconventional (among them, Katharine McPhee and Rumer Willis). The college has already told them that if they don't find new members, the Zeta house will be shut down. It is going to be Shelley's biggest challenge to turn the sorority into an attractive place for the new students. Can she do it? Perhaps, Shelly could ask for the help and advice of a nursing home director, Oliver (Colin Hanks), a nice man she met in a park? After a brief, blase beginning, this film packs a good punch of light comedy and romance. Part of the credit should go to the very nice cast. Faris is wonderful in her role as the dimwitted bunny who has more than enough smarts to learn a few new tricks and Hanks, in a smaller role, is quite nice as the love interest. The Zeta girls themselves, especially Rumer Willis and Emma Stone, are a delightful bunch of offbeat creatures that learn some lessons themselves. The rest of the cast, including Christopher McDonald and Beverly D'Angelo, is good, also. The costumes, naturally, are very fine, as this is a gal-dominated movie and clothes are especially important. But, the sunny sets, cinematography, screenplay, and direction are up to snuff as well. No, it's not Willie Shakespeare but the flick is definitely a good diversion from the everyday blues. It's a likely bet that you will find this ""Bunny"" to be quite funny indeed.",2008
6,"""The House Bunny"" has a funny concept and what looks like a ""Legally Blonde"" form of execution. If Anna Faris, most commonly known as the one portraying/making fun of the Neve Campbell ""Scream"" role in the ""Scary Movies"" was ever going to become the next big female comedienne the time would be now. She showed she was willing to make fun of herself in those movies but I still wonder if she can play a sincere, actual human being rather than a character meant to be the punch line most of the time. ""Bunny"" was written by ""Blonde"" screenwriters Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith so that could be good news but a lot of the weight of this movie is going to rest on the shoulders of it star. Reese Witherspoon made that movie what it was and the big question here is, can Faris do the same? ",2008

6,"Ever since I saw the trailer for The House Bunny back in May, I was looking forward to seeing it, this looked like a fun comedy and we all love Anna Faris, this girl is just adorable, and she makes comedies a lot of fun. So I saw The House Bunny yesterday and I did enjoy myself, but we've done this before, the dumb blonde story, not that we can't do it again, I'm just looking for something a little fresh. But Anna Faris holds herself so well with comedies, The House Bunny, she doesn't seem to enjoy herself as much in this role. A lot of the moments where she acts stupid, she looks a little uncomfortable at times, I think that's why this movie didn't stand out as well as other dumb blonde comedies. But it's mindless entertainment, the message, it worries me a little, I'll explain why in a little bit, but I'd say if you're a grown up and you know better, than this is a fun little movie.",2008

You'll laugh out loud at much of the humor, and you'll fall in love with Anna Faris. It's just silly fun. Anna Farris plays a ditsy blond who gets kicked out of the Playboy Mansion (Hugh Hefner is a good sport in this movie!), ends up homeless, and ends up as a house mother for a sorority of ""loser"" girls (smart girls who don't know how to attract boys). The sorority is about to lose its charter because they can't get enough pledges, and of course Faris saves the day for the sorority by teaching the girls how to be popular, and, along the way, she learns a few lessons herself. You'll enjoy knowing that her love interest is played by Colin Hanks, son of Tom Hanks, and that some of the people in the Playboy mansion and at the party at the mansion are played by themselves. Also, Rumer Willis, daughter of Bruce Willis and Demi Moore and Katherine McPhee from American Idol are girls in the sorority. I thoroughly enjoyed this light movie.",2008

4,"Ladies and gentlemen, imagine if you will the concept of cinematic schizophrenia. It's okay if you don't quite grasp the idea behind this concept because I just then made it up especially for this review. However, should a movie ever adopt the illness that is cinematic schizophrenia, it will undoubtedly in some way or another resemble the bewildering mess that is House Bunny. Here is a film that is one thing, then another, and then another and so on. It's a feature that gives the audiences some genuine laughs, and yet tacks on drama so soppy and melodramatic that it's hard to take anything in the vicinity of its presence with any degree of sincerity. There's also some brilliant performances, and yet the thespians involved are neglected to play out shady, two dimensional cut outs for characters; going through act one, two and three with a different wardrobe, and a whole new personality to match. What hurts the movie most however isn't this mix of successful elements with mundane ones, but the collision that occurs when they try to blend; House Bunny is a confusing, disjointed affair that entertains sporadically and yet has around the same amount of potential to irritate and bore. In the end, much like a ""bunny"" in reality, this isn't going to give the brain cells much company and whatever fun is had will be quickly forgotten in no time; shallow, trite and ridiculously unfocused, House Bunny should be fine enough for teenage girls looking for some brain dead amusement, but for anyone else, this is material best left alone.",2008

Somebody in Hollywood must have thought, ""Well, all I have to do is combine mostly 'Legally Blond' with some 'Animal House' thrown in, with a nod to 'Forest Gump,' and I'll make millions."" The difference is that the characters in all these comedies were actually likable and we rooted for them.

Everything in this movie is undeveloped, except the bra size of the ""house bunny.""",2008

Stupid premise, very predictable, quite awkward, embarrassing movie. One positive note.... Catherine McPhee was charming and great in her role. She definitely has a future in acting. Her role was small but credible and showed promise. Rumer Willis should keep her day job, whatever that might be. I felt sorry for Anna Faris. She looked good in the movie but the content was an embarrassment. Drippy, sappy, stupid. And what was Beverly D'Angelo thinking associating herself with this mess? And Hugh Hefner and the girls next door? Don't waste your time or money on this drivel.",2008

This is an important scene, and my immediate assumption was that we, the audience, were meant to shake our fists at the screen and say, ""Yeah!"" But then I remembered that for well over an hour by then, the movie had been scrambling frantically to get us to laugh at how genuinely and spectacularly dumb she is.",2008
4,"After being evicted from the Playboy Mansion for being too old at 27, Shelley Darlingson (Anna Faris) now homeless, has little choice but to move into the Zeta Sorority House, whose seven misfit members risk losing their house unless they receive thirty pledges from potential new Zetas. So in exchange for living there, Shelley dedicates herself to the task of making the Zetas popular to help them attract pledges. An orphan whose only real home has been the Playboy Mansion, Shelley is incredibly naive with no real world experience, and is therefore the ultimate archetypal dumb blonde character, trading one comfortable environment for another. From the same writers of Legally Blonde, The House Bunny attempts to imitate the success of the former. Unfortunately the film fails on all accounts. Legally Blonde was successful largely due to Reese Witherspoon's likability, subverting her dumb blonde image in the film. The House Bunny makes no attempt to dispel this stereotype: Shelley tells the sorority girls that popularity is increased through higher levels of attractiveness. The film is also hugely clichéd: there isn't anything that hasn't been seen before here. Complete with the typical cheesy montages in which the characters toil as inspiring music is played, the film is entirely formulaic. The film is completely predictable from the start, with no surprises whatsoever. Anna Faris is not particularly likable; during her appearance on Friends (playing Erica in the final series) she was just about bearable. However, now given a feature length film, the increase in screen time just serves to highlight her lack of talent as an actress. Shelley is irritating, stupid beyond belief and not remotely funny. The biggest laugh in the film comes unintentionally from Hugh Hefner in a cameo role, who actually manages the feat of failing at playing himself. Emma Stone (Jules in Superbad) does well enough with a terrible script; whereas Rumer Willis, daughter of Bruce, is given little opportunity to show off any acting abilities she may possess. Overall 'The House Bunny' is a poor film that brings nothing new to a tired genre.",2008

If scared of bats beware, there is 20 minutes of animal porn,surprised me. Anna Faris makes me believe in love and that anyone looks good in pink. Emma stones breakout performance. Believe in love everyone. Don't watch if pregnant. Great movie to watch for a car ride. Is on two discs since its extra long. Was shot with one camera, no lighting. Need 3-d glasses to see whole film. YAY! The house bunny is a movie for all houses, expect those with more than 4 dogs.",2012
3,Don't expect too much of The House Bunny. It's just another teen movie that you can definitely judge by its cover. It's basically a silly story of a playboy bunny that is kicked off the Playboy Mansion and has really nothing to hold on to - and has to start over. The plot line is very simple and the movie is very predictable with loads of clichés.,2011
10,"The House Bunny was one of the funnest and freshest movies I have seen this year. It had many good laughs. That wasn't the best part of this movie though it was mostly the humor and Anna Faris. She did a terrific job playing the character of a playboy bunny. She gets kicked out of the playboy mansion because she was to old. Their were some fun unexpected turns this movie took. It was very cute and very fun to watch. Emma Stone was very good as well and she added a lot to this movie. She looked very good and was extremely funny. The whole movie was good. The cast was good as well. This movie didn't really have to many flaws at all that i can think of. I think in my opinion this was the best chick flick comedy I have seen. I would see this movie again just to see the cast and the funny comments they make. This movie had way more facial expressions and comments that will make you laugh. Anna Faris was definitely funnier than she ever has been in this movie. The visuals were very cool as well. This movie was fresh, original, funny, fun and very sexy. I would say go see this movie at all costs. Don't miss out on this one it was great. This was definitely a great chick flick for teen aged girls to see. Enjoy this one I know I sure did.",2008
1,"This film is a scary reflection on the way things are going at the moment, with young girls being encouraged to aspire to be porn stars. For example, Playboy pencil cases and bedding being marketed to children. Playboy is a vile producer of hardcore porn which degrades women. This film is not just a bit of fun, it has serious consequences for girls' psyches and for society as a whole. Whatever happened to aspiring to being intelligent and informed and self-fulfilled? Today's girls are brought up to think that their sexuality is all they have to offer. Do not see this film, it is poison. Listen to Mark Kemode's review http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/console/b00dsd15 about 37 mins in for some common sense on the matter.",2008
9,"I gave this movie 9 stars out of 10 because it made me laugh, it made me laugh a lot, and I was still laughing after I left the theater. Anna Faris is a hoot, and you can't help but love her. (She's the Goldie Hawn of the early 2000's)Everyone else in the movie ends up loving her because she's the epitome of goodness and loving. Even tho the movie is basic in it's good people vs their antagonists it works, and it's not meant to do anything but entertain, amuse, and make you laugh. I was expecting a rehashed Animal House, but it's not that at all. It's a feel-good movie all the way. Forget all the Summer comic book fare and go see this one, you will not regret it and you'll feel a lot better than after having seen The Dark Knight, I assure you!",2008
3,"Quantum of Solace is the follow-up to the electrifying reboot of the 007 franchise, Casino Royale. By the end of that film, I have to say, I was ecstatic about the direction the Bond films were heading. If you haven't seen it, Casino Royale told what was basically a James Bond origin story. It showed how Bond became the legend we see today, and by the film's end, it seemed as though Bond was back. It gave the impression that the next film would show 007 in all his classic glory, with action, gadgets, exotic locations, and spy thrills. Instead, Quantum of Solace turns out to be a hollow, depressing exercise in new age ""gritty"" action movies. ",2015
3,Bond Review. ,2015
1,"I went twice to see this movie. First on the Berlin Premiere, second time a week later. Why? Well, on premiere night I had tickets in row 7, of a huge theatre. I was hugely excited to see the new Bond (as I always have been for the past 25 some years). But hey, I had to LEAVE the theatre after 15 minutes. You simply can't watch that fast edited MTV Style movie in row 7 (!). No chance, absolutely. Okay so I went again, this time a nice seat all the way at the end of the same theatre. I could endure the MTV cuts, but not the massacre the producers did to Bond. (the director can't be held responsible, since the producers chose him and not vice versa). ",2008
1,"I managed about ten minutes of this movie, and that was quite enough.",2014
5,"What a band of clueless idiots wrote, directed and produced this film. Someone should have told them before that the general public is tired of this new fashion of quick editing, cutting the action scenes and fights to pieces so that the viewer sees... nothing. It is an awful film-making method, which spoilt greatly ""Gladiator"" for me and then several other action films, including this one. Large chinks of the Decalogue are totally cliché and boring. To have such a product, such a budget and choose a talentless director and a mediocre script is very disappointing. I like the them song though, contrary to most I consider it one of the strongest Bond songs of all time. I hope to see more fun, joy of living dangerously and expensively and more sophistication in the next Bond. Finally, someone wrote here that Judy Dench is in fact always the same, I agree. She must be the most overrated actress ever.",2008
1,Save your money. This movie is terrible and has nothing whatsoever to do with the iconic character of James Bond.,2008
1,"Thought this was one of the worst Bond movies ever. Nothing of the magic that made many of the other 007 movies so special was to be found here. The cutting of the film is terrible. masses of 2 second sequences thrown together - for no apparent reason. (as the movie is so boring I found myself counting ""one...two...) over and over again. If the action is poor it appears a cheap trick to try to ""create interest"" by chopping it all up and using 25 cameras to shoot that which has no interest. It just comes across as irritating and silly.",2008
3,"This is the first time I ever came out of a Bond film at the cinema thinking, 'I enjoyed almost none of that.' And there was no mystery for me as to why I felt this way. I didn't have to weigh up the other pros and cons (it is not an unsophisticated film) or think far or deeply. I couldn't stand Quantum Of Solace because ninety-five percent of its action sequences are appallingly directed and edited. Endless, wobbly extreme closeups are cut together too rapidly into a meaningless dirge which prohibits you from discerning anything about the nature of the scene.",2008

1,"This has to be THE worst bond film of all time! Right from the opening scene, which is traditionally an action packed opening to blow you away, was awful. It's fast paced action was lost by a camera set too close to the action and flicking between camera shots so fast it was subliminal and far to fast for the human brain to register any action. After a few seconds I was totally lost, as was everyone else I spoke too. ",2008
2,"I saw this in the theatre a few years ago when it came out, and the funny thing was, I couldn't remember a thing about it. So, when it was on cable TV a couple nights ago, I decided to watch it again to see if it was any good. ",2014
1,The movie starts with an 'action' sequence where Bond is being chased through the mountains in some fancy car... or maybe he's chasing someone through the mountains... or maybe he's driving down to Brighton for an afternoon at the beach and some other people are chasing each other through the mountains... or... who knows? They obviously spent a ton of cash on this sequence but then they cut it together in three-frame chunks so the audience have no idea what the heck is going on.,2009
2,"Of course, we should not give this movie too much credit. Our beloved James Bond -francise has been dying since the input of the modern action style. This one was just sucking the remains. Bond-movies were about excessive stories and survival. That enjoyable B-class is gone for good. Updating James Bond was unavoidable but destructive.",2010
5,"When I first heard Marc Forster would direct the latest Bond film, I was delighted. It seemed as though the studio was continuing Bond's fresh new direction in that drama and character take precedent over ridiculous action. In Casino Royale, all of the action sequences are realistic and essential to the story. Quantum of solace, on the other hand, is mindless action with little story tacked on as an afterthought.",2009

5,"Let me say from the start that Daniel Craig is one of the finest actors having played James Bond, maybe the best since Sean Connery. Judy Dench is also the best M. ever, and the idea of a female M. is just genial. Yet, the series are in trouble, and something needs to be done to save the series from the downturn that seems worst than the world economy.",2009
5,"From a Bond Film we expect lot of action scenes, chivalry and a good dose of chauvinistic humor. Quantum of Solace offers only on the story front an intellectually simulating service. However good a story is, a Bond film is ultimately supposed to be lots of fun. In this title from the very beginning Bond is in a very sombre mood and throughout the film this environment of gloom pervades. ",2009
1,"I am a HUGE Bond fan, books and movies. Loved Casino -- music, credits, gags, plot. Just watched it again. I will shell out bucks to see Daniel Craig's CHEST and his million watt smile, both MIA in this movie except for a nanosecond. They shot in Italy, for crying out loud -- couldn't they scare up a Lamborghini or a Testa Rossa for Bond to play with? No great cars; no sex, just talking about self-hate; no gadgets; Dench was wasted. Feeble plot, like bad 70's TV. Did anybody else notice that the girl's backstory was lifted from Hemingway's For Whom the Bell Tolls?",2008
8,"I have to admit that I have a soft spot for Guy Ritchie's mockney gangster films. I don't know what it is. I know that they're not very profound and have nothing to say, I know that they're a pure fantasy vision of British crime and I know that if you've seen Lock Stock, you've pretty much seen them all. And yet, as Ritchie returns for a third iteration of the only formula with which he's tasted success , I still find myself walking out of the cinema massively entertained.",2008

Not to anyone's surprise he does this with what he has been so potent with throughout his career; a British gangster film.

8,"In a business as enormously subjective as the film industry, it would seem near impossible to attempt to remain individual and innovative, continually raising the bar, without the occasional stumble. Writer/director Guy Ritchie, who at first garnered countless approval for his vicious, hyper-stylized tales of dirty deeds in the British underground, had found the critical tides turning in recent years after the succession of universally panned Swept Away to widely baffling Revolver, begging the question as to whether Ritchie's cinematic genius had been limited to his initial films. However, fans of the unconventional filmmaker will be enthralled to hear that his latest project, RocknRolla proves a confident return to form, a snappy, stylish piece of work bristling with energy and acerbic wit - in short, classic Ritchie.",2008
9,"After some failures in his career as a director, Guy Ritchie is back with a fast paced, frenetic movie. A film about a Russian mobster orchestrates a crooked land deal, millions of dollars are up for grabs, and all of London?s criminal underworld wants in on the action. Everyone from a dangerous crime lord to a sexy accountant, a corrupt politician and down-on-their-luck petty thieves conspire, collude and collide with one another in an effort to get rich quick. The story is interesting and the plot is very well developed. Its a film with lots of action and adventure, it has also a very good amount of black humor, characteristic from Ritchie's movies, and full of twists and an unexpected ending.The direction from Ritchie is excellent, the first hour might be a little slow but from the second hour till the end the movie takes a very fast rhythm and the fast forwards and slow motions increases the intensity of the movie. The cast is amazing, Gerard Butler gives a formidable performance, Thandie Newton also very good, Tom Wilkinson flawless as always and the secondary roles from Toby Kebbell (Johnny Quid), Idris Elba (Mumbles) and Mark Strong (Archie) gave the movie a very good support. In conclusion, RocknRolla is a entertaining movie you will enjoy and that will keep you on the edge of your seat.",2008

Then he married Madonna and made a few bum movies, especially ""Revolver."" Well rest easy, Guy Richie Fans, the man who made the two great movies I listed above is back and funnier, more intense, and a better writer/director than ever. The first ten or twenty minutes of the movie are a little confusing, but as long as you follow the characters and events (which isn't hard to do since they're fantastic and well acted) you'll understand and enjoy ""RocknRolla"".

With his 2006 release of Revolver, many of his avid followers found new 'stylistic' directors to drool over, the movie itself receiving mostly negative reviews as a majority of moviegoers claimed it to be 'all style and no substance'. His latest release, RocknRolla, shows Ritchie returning to his roots of gangster oriented, moronic villain centered, hit-man featuring fun. It's a welcome return.",2008

2,"Would somebody PLEASE stop Guy Ritchie from writing scripts like a 15 year old public schoolboy living out some ridiculous nefarious fantasies. I cannot believe that anyone can see this film as anything other than what it is - a stream of Guy Ritchie consciousness packaged up with a load of bad language, embarrassing dialogue, two-dimensional characters you couldn't care less about and utterly utterly stupid plot - at least this time he's not trying to make it look like a Bacardi Breezer commercial - and for that I give it one more star!

6,"It says something that most of the press coverage for Guy Ritchie's new film 'Rocknrolla' surrounds the fact that Madonna was late for the London premiere. While the name Madonna is somewhat synonymous with 'show stealer', some might argue that the vast coverage of this minor marital incident masks the fact that Ritchie's film doesn't merit any serious film chit chat.",2008
1,"RocknRolla is your average British gangster film with not to many thrills. It drags for most of the yawning 1 hour 50 minutes, but does however contain some minor successes. Firstly to state that RocknRolla is definitely Ritchies worst. Not only this but it lacks tone and deep story telling that Ritchie was once good at doing. It disintegrates also on action and comedy, which sadly adds to the further half-handed mediocre of RocknRolla. The characters however, do sometimes interest with their more than average dialogue and quirky sense of humour. Despite saying that the characters do make their fair share of jokes, this doesn't alter the fact that it's not consistency throughout Rocknrolla. The action and stylish violence that Ritchie once demonstrated in Snatch sadly is mislaid by a poor story.",2008

From what I've seen, everyone better love this movie! This film has it all: gunfights, gangsters, British slang, Gerard Butler, memorable lines, and even some poorly behaved American crayfish. Somehow, Ritchie finds enough film time to fit cameos by Jeremy Piven and Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges in there.",2008
10,this movie without a doubt has the best style any movie can offer. there's not one thing i disliked about this film. the acting was superb. Ritchie's weaving complex story that he always does is brilliant. just everything is brilliant,2009
3,"The consensus seems to be amongst contributors here that RocknRolla is a 'return to form' for Guy Ritchie. I should point out at this point that I don't accept the premise that he had ever struck vein of 'form' in the first place. He did to some extent (and not necessarily to his credit) create a distinctive genre of British film with Smoking Barrels and Snatch and, in the sense that this is almost identical to those earlier films, RocknRolla it is certainly a return to something.",2008
8,"Great movie! Unusual title! leave it to the British film makers to make amazing movies with strange titles. ""The Full Monty,"" ""James Bond: Octopussy,"" and of course ""RocknRolla."" What is a 'RocknRolla'? I'm not entirely sure if the film really explained it clear enough but you know this is a Guy Ritchie film, where it doesn't matter as long as the film looks good. The Formalist style of film making is clearly seen in this film with the hard core action and violence, and a scene where someone finds a creative use for a pencil (by stabbing it in someone's neck) but it is not as violent as I had hoped it to be, and since this is formalism style of film making the violence and action had to look cool as opposed to being real, which is probably why when Johnny Quid stabbed the guy in the neck like twelve times with a pencil there was no blood or markings, but really I was too busy going ""what the hell?"" to notice.",2010
1,"If you were expecting something new, vibrant and original in Guy Ritchie's latest offering, then you're in for a major let down. The same old elements are present: small-time gangster wannabes, guns, violence and not forgetting the pointless swearing and much needed anger-management. Rocknrolla is a film that doesn't keep you guessing, in fact, it makes you think about having spent your entrance fee on another film. What is needed is an injection of new material, instead of an injection to numb the pain. The only thing missing to complete this film's total lack of originality is his wife, Madonna. Speaks volumes to say the very least.",2008

There is no movie I have ever seen that has so many characters that are as fun to watch as in Snatch. I was looking forward to RocknRolla. So sad. Yikes! I barely liked any character. The action and dialog seem geared more to audience members of the half-wit gang-impersonator ilk that are rampant in today's global culture. Just kind of stupid glorification of violence and macho-posturing. I don't know how Guy descended into this kind of low cinema. I like his previous crime movies because they are thoughtful, novel, intelligent, and had colorful characters played by good actors who ate their roles up in style. And ultimately, even if some were truly bad guys, they played them with such panache you relished their performance(ex. Brick Top). With this movie it was almost the opposite: I found myself disliking almost everyone in it. Most everyone was bland and the ones that stood out were not the ones I would want to stand out and watch(the punk rocker kid, barf.) I hate to review it so badly because Snatch continues to bring such enjoyment into my life so I am fond of Guy Ritchie. But I actually came out of the theater disdainful at this one.",2008

I don't know why, but we just need action movies like that and one of the things that I did enjoy about this was that it reminded me of those old grind house films that have quick editing and fast paced stories that are just awesome stories to watch because of the stunts. This is a different form of The Fast and The Furious, only just not with all the fancy gadgets which I like. Also, Jason Statham, this guy is just awesome in action movies, he makes such a great lead in any action role and is such an awesome tough guy that you don't want to mess with.",2008

I'll try but I'm not making any promises. It is fun, very loud and unabashedly dumb. It was never envisioned to be anything other than an attempt at 'cool.' The average viewer will - without fail - be able to pick out every moment where Paul W.S. Anderson had an idea during the script writing and thought to himself ""That'd be awesome!"" before looking around the room for someone to high five. I shouldn't pick on him because I actually do enjoy his movies. He isn't trying to make 'Casablanca'; 'Robocop' is more his style. Just without the boring stuff like characterization and development.

While anyone going into this film expecting anything more then a thin veil of a plot will be sorely disappointed, it will definitely entertain those who have the right expectations. That said, this is a no holds barred, testosterone fueled thrill ride. Think of the game Twisted Metal, then throw in convicts, a greedy warden looking only at the profit and you have Death Race. While the movie has plenty of explosions, machine guns, armored cars, gore and beautiful females, there was enough humor and sentiment thrown in to make it all seem worthwhile. Definitely an entertaining film, and one that any over-the-top action movie junkie will surely add to their collection.",2008
8,"""Death Race"" puts me in a moral dilemma. Its deliberately trashy, shallow and inept, and for some reason I still like it. Making my feelings even more conflicted is the fact that it was directed by Paul W.S Anderson, a director who tries to turn movies into video games, and always fails.

Plenty of wow moments to cringe at and not just me but the whole audience. The driving does get a little repetitive but kudos to the director Paul w.s. Anderson for mixing it up.

Now he remakes the original movie Death race 2000. Not surprising. While watching this movie, I realised that he still has his habit of making games plots.

Nevertheless this is a great movie, the humor is spot on throughout the movie, though this is definitely no comedy. The action is fast paced throughout and they come up with some pretty creative ways for characters to get killed. I found the story to obviously be a bit far fetched with it being people racing in a prison and all but never that didn't ruin the movie at all and I ended up loving the storyline. Overall, the acting was great, and it had great effects and a good storyline. I consider this a must watch for those who love action movies. 9/10",2008

7,"If ""Mario Kart"" was a movie and it had characters similar to the video game ""Twisted Metal"" this movie would be it. I really don't see why critics bash this movie so much, yes it isn't a Oscar worthy movie nor is it a very intelligent movie. But it sure is entertaining and was so stupid to the point it got irritating. People that decide to see this movie should know what they are getting into or else they might dislike it. Overall when I saw this movie in theater I really enjoyed it and had a blast with it, sure some of the plot holes are obvious but this is still a solid thrill ride. Personally I had a blast with this movie and Jason Statham was good in this role since he fit in with his tough guy exterior and I bought it. There is good amount of sex appeal and Ian McShane is just right as well while playing the character named Coach. This is a thrill ride that is like watching a actually entertaining video game movie. However if the script was a bit more intelligent it would have been better though although I didn't expect a solid script from Paul W.S. Anderson.",2011
1,"Jason Statham plays one type of character, but he almost always plays it to perfection: the suave, stubbly, and sometimes smarmy would-be Bond from madcap B movies like ""Crank"" and ""Ghosts of Mars.""

8,"Regardless of the politically-correct finish to this film and the predictable prison stereotypes, this was a fun film to watch simply because it entertained. It was a good diversion, filled with total nonsense mayhem and testosterone-gone-wild. In other words, this was a typical Jason Statham film. No matter how many of these ultra-macho men he plays, he gets away with it with charm and likability.",2009

8,"Synopsis - In 2012, the United States economy collapses and life for everyone is not the same. Once a NASCAR champion, Jensen Ames, (Jason Statham), hits rock bottom and spent several years in prison. His life was improving and changing for the better after meeting and marrying Suzy (Janaya Stephens) and having a baby girl. Then the steel mill closes, and he loses his job. But that was not the worst thing to happen to Jenson that day. Suzy is brutally murdered, and he is framed for her murder. Jenson is sent to Terminal Island, the worst and toughest for-profit prison in the country run by Warden Hennessey (Joan Allen). She has created the country's most popular pay-per-view sport, a kill-or-be-killed car race where the inmates race to win their freedom from prison after 5 wins. Every inmate driver is driving a monster car that they built which is loaded with machine guns, missiles, flamethrowers, napalm, and no rules. Warden Hennessey convinces Jensen to secretly take the place of the late 4-time superstar winner, Frankenstein, and wear his metallic mask in the race. If Jensen wins just one race, he can go home to his baby daughter. To get to the finish line, Jensen must kill his competition before they kill him.",2008
10,"Death Race was a perfect movie in my opinion. It was action packed, bloody, gore, and even sexy. It was a lot of fun to watch. I really enjoyed this movie because the story was great and it had a lot of meaning. This was a great movie to start ending the summer with. The acting was very good. Jason Staham played a perfect role maybe his best role yet. Tyrese Gibson added a good performance as well. The stunts and driving that was performed in this movie was amazing. The visuals were so cool and so were the special effects. the movie really was entertaining and a wild ride from beginning to end. Just strap in and get ready for a really fun enjoyable action packed film. This movie holds nothing back it goes for it all. The blood was crazy and their were a ton of people dying. I also loved the originality of this film. I don't think there are to many maybe no movies that are anything like this movie. The title for this movie describes the movie perfectly. This was definitely worth seeing for a couple dollars. I will see it again and again. It is way better than what I was expecting it to be. It isn't boring for one second in the movie at all. Another great thing was the movie was very unpredictable. Twists and turns kept coming in every scene in the movie. The outcome was very good. Overall this movie was great and you will be very happy in the end after you see this movie.",2008
5,"""Death Race"" was written and directed by Paul W.S Anderson, a filmmaker whose toiled away trying to make the perfect movie based on a video game. I'll give you a few moments to process that before I sayyeah, that's right, he's made some really terrible movies. ""Death Race"" actually looks sort of fun though, definitely a racing film that will erase the memory of the ""Speed Racer Technicolor Dream-Coat"" at least, and Jason Statham is usually so good in movies like this that he'd make ""Fast and the Furious"" look like ""Beach Blanket Bingo"" all by himself. This may be Anderson's first real entertaining movie, but there has been some question as to whether it really is his movie. Writer Adam Stone says Anderson stole his work, leading to some speculation of plagiarism and possibly to a denied wide release. So there are two questions, one of course will be answered if your reading this review and the other will be is this movie even worth stealing in the first place? ",2008
3,"The trailer seemed to suggest that this is another take on the Running Man theme. Actually, the original Death Race came out before the RM novel, but I did not see it, so I do not know how close the 2008 version is to the one from 1975. However, I do know that the main plot of the 2008 version is essentially identical to that of RM---a guy wrongfully imprisoned and exploited for his skills in some gladiator contest, this time with tank-like cars. The RM featured some over-the-top characters and action that was clearly tongue-in-cheek, and was essentially a media satire with an action theme. I interpreted Joan Allen's involvement as an indication that perhaps this would be an update of that idea.",2008

7,"For those that don't already know, the second half to that ""Zack and Miri"" title is ""Make a Porno"", three little words that have caused a lot of fuss lately. In addition to being deliberately shortened on TV, Kevin Smith (Clerks, Chasing Amy) has had to fight for even the R-rating, a teaser trailer had to be removed from his website, the posters for the flick were so raunchy that the characters could only appear as stick figures(of which Seth Rogen is assuredly not), and already certain theaters have decided not to show it while openly showing Saw V and Max Payne without a moments hesitation. All this for one of the years nicest romantic comedies. ""Zack and Miri"" is vintage Kevin Smith, blending the cheerily offensive with heartfelt sentimentality, and while its nothing groundbreaking or even terribly gratuitous (sure there are some cock and ball, ass, and boob shots but what comedy doesn't have those now-adays), it's also one of Smith's most successful attempts with the formula.",2008
7,"First off, do not watch this with your parent, grandparents or in-laws. You can definitely feel that this is a Kevin Smith feel, and the fact that it has Jason Mewes in it could have been a strong hint also. Zack and Miri Make a Porno is a strange but enjoyable love story, cleverly written by Smith so that you do actually feel the romance behind the porn. ",2009
8,"Thanks to the aptly named title, brilliantly appointed by Kevin Smith (writer, director, and creator of the View Askew Universe), you go into the film with a certain mindset, a dirty one to be exact. This follows the explicit what-you-see-is-what-you-get nature of every pornographic film title, a fact that offers hilarious moments as Zack and Miri are eventually faced with the difficult task of creating a movie title that says it all.",2008

Usually, they make movies hit-or-misses financially, but deceptive marketing shows a lot of faith in a film, which is what every viewer should have in this one.

If you're a fan of his films, you won't be disappointed. If you're not, get the hell on board, cause this movie is hilarious. The movie has some of his most classic scenes by far, with some great performances and spectacular lines by Justin Long, Rogen, Mewes, and Craig Robinson who steals the show. I guarantee you won't leave the theater unsatisfied. It's like Clerks 2 had sex with Dogma, and left the horrendous emotional scenes at the door, and kept the bad ass dialogue thoroughly intact.",2008

That's right, watch the titles, wait *through* the color bar, and don't leave until you see the parental guidance screen (again). I'd be writing a spoiler if I told you why, but if you like this movie you'll want to keep watching till it's *all over*.",2008
4,"Kevin Smith's name has become almost irreversibly linked with hilariously vulgar dialogue and the notions of pushing the boundaries of good taste in comedy. And while Zack and Miri definitely contains a few scenes of Smith's trademark atrocities, it never really hurdles over that line of decency that is practically expected, nor does it relish in the typically volatile conversations notorious in his previous work. For better or for worse, Zack and Miri just isn't that funny. And since it's coming from Kevin Smith, the latter is more likely.",2008

3,"Struggling roommates come up with an idea to make a quick buck in this lame comedy. The script is amateurish and humorless. What's more, there isn't a single two-dimensional character here. Everybody is a caricature and the relationship between Rogan and Banks is never believable. In fact, all the characters are so crude and rude that they don't resemble really people. The film is based on the sophomoric premise that the f-word is funny, and that cramming multiple f-words into every line will make the film hilarious. Not only does the comedy not work at all, but the later attempt to turn the film into a touching romance falls completely flat.",2010

I didn't know how so many guys liked this. They main film is low budget than the created porno. Same old fashion love story involving bad debts compelling to make a porno which was cut off due to love then they separate and finally fell in love in a nice climax.

What the title doesn't tell you is that while making a porno, Zack & Miri, and their other accomplices, will make you laugh pretty hard.

One of these guys (Routh) is so handsome and charming Miri crudely and of course futilely propositions him on the spot. Zack happens to talk to his lover (Long, hilariously deep-voiced and confident). It turns out the gay men produce and act in their own profitable line of gay porn films. They really are good-looking and have it together, and Zack and Miri, being so broke their electricity and water have been cut off, decide to make a porno of their own. The plot twist, obvious in conventional romantic comedy terms, is that the process of shooting a sex scene with them in it makes Zack and Miri, who, we don't know exactly why, have contented themselves with hasty, meaningless sex with others up to now, realize--after a slight delay--that they've really loved each other along.",2008

The fact that so many people fell for such predictable trite and vulgarity for the sake of vulgarity's sake. And don't get me wrong, I'm by no means a conservative, Scary Movie is one of my most favorite movies, and I love comedies, but again, this movie was just ridiculous. Seth Rogan has to be the most overrated, most annoying new actor out there. What is his charm? Oh, big fat lovable fat guy? I think NOT. He's disgusting, and his big ego is a big factor in that. CHRIS FARLEY was lovable. This guy makes me want to barf. And seeing him have sex in this movie, even in character, I wanted to rip my eyes out, in fact, I turned away from the screen and shut my ears and I could not even believe how stupid the people were around me that they said that they actually enjoyed this stupid movie with weak dialogue, oversimplified stereotypes, and just overall ridiculousness. It wasn't the porn that bothered me, it was the poor acting and boring dialogue, I would've loved to have seen this same story done, but with actors that are not full of themselves or conceited or big douchebags like Seth Rogan, and with a better script and to not have it be full of comedy clichés and stereotypes. Just ridiculous, the fact that people actually like this movie and go as far as to say that Seth Rogan is a genius and that this was the best movie ever is a perfect example of why people think that America is getting dumber by the minute.

Red State went straight to video. Who keeps giving this washed up director money to make crap? Seth Rogaine is a terrible actor. He must be playing himself over and over again.

9,"As I was watching the first 30 minutes of the bio flick ""Bronson"", I thought it had a death wish or something. It does take a while to let this movie hit you. ""Bronson"" is based on the true story of who is called England's most notorious prisoner, that would be Michael Peterson better known by his alias Charlie Bronson. He has been incarcerated for 36 years, and 31 in solitary confinement. He never killed anyone, just was convicted of armed robbery a few times; but it was his feisty ways in the prisons and psych wards he did time in that got him all that time. Instead of trying to breakout, Bronson wanted to stay in prison but not exactly as a Solitary Man. He relished on physically brutalizing prison guards and other cellmates, not to mention taking a few as hostages. Bronson also had an artistic side that is also highlighted in Writer-Director's Nicolas Winding Refn movie. Refn's screenplay with Brock Norman Brock did escape the rules of viewer engagement from time to time with its extreme bizarreness, but somehow it boldly & bloody worked. Kudos goes to Refn for orchestrating those power-punching scenes where Charlie B. is refn so many up. Also, I must commend his direction of the comedic scenes of observing Charlie readapting to social civilization upon being released after his first ""prison tour of duty"". But ""Bronson"" would not be a brawny feature without the tour-de-performance of Tom Hardy. This Hardy Boy sure did not lack a punch with his dead-ringer Bronson transformation. It will be hard to knock out Hardy as a surefire grand actor for years to come. It is hard to fathom that this is the same actor who played The Cleaner in ""Inception"", two exemplary performances but diverse in so many ways. ""Bronson"" is worth putting in the time for no better reason just to witness Tom Hardy's extraordinaire hard work. So pass Go and matchup with ""Bronson"". ***** Excellent",2010

A four year stay has turned into a thirty-four year prison term, thirty of which has been spent in solitary confinement.",2009
9,"Bronson is one of the more interesting films I've had the pleasure of sitting through as of late. In the trailer (and movie poster), a quote can be seen where a reviewer called the film, ""A Clockwork Orange for the 21st century."" That quote is really spot-on. There is a big Clockwork Orange influence in this film. While Michael Peterson narrates the entire film, the film jumps between what actually happened and Peterson performing in front of an audience in a rather large theater. The make-up, the setting, and Hardy's performance are all very Clockwork Orange-esquire. Another film that came to mind was Snatch. The action sequences and a lot of the humor had a similar vibe to Guy Ritchie's film. Bronson is very much its own film, but shares the same beloved qualities of the films mentioned.",2009

He is arrested for stealing and due to his rambunctious nature, he tends to spend a lot of time alone. Upon his release, he takes up bare fisted boxing at the suggestion of a man he met in jail. He needs a fighting name, so he chose Charles Bronson because it is a name people associate with vengeance. The main actor is amazing!!! He has many monologues and pulls you in with his insanity. The real Bronson is still incarcerated and has written a few books. He is in great physical shape, so he wrote one about how he keeps in shape in prison. He seems a bit split personality and he switched between them with ease. When the movie ended, I wanted more, so I went on line to learn more. This is truly an entertaining movie and I'm glad I was made aware of it.",2009

The trailer for Nicholas Winding Refn's ""Bronson"" spouts the likeness triumphantly with a quote attributed to Damien McSorley for the publication, ""Zoo."" Surely Kubrick is a flattering filmmaker to have your humble work compared to, though like American director Wes Anderson, who borrows all the style of the man but none of the content, ""Bronson"" is a film with an air of grandiosity and very little in the way of actual story. Kubrick's film, based on the novel by Anthony Burgess, has a Dickensian plot that doubles back on characters and scenarios established in the first act, leaving nothing unchanged by the end of the third. It's a comparison under which ""Bronson"" unfavorably suffers: well directed, impeccably performed, but completely devoid of structure.",2010

I was utterly blown away by its style and technical perfection, and the actors' performances so I decided to investigate director Nicolas Winding Refn's earlier films. Perhaps Drive was the wrong film to start with. Bronson, radically different from Drive, sports a much more avant garde style; I'd go as far as to say it's very similar to Kubrick. I was caught off guard. I enjoyed the style and Hardy's brilliance, but I wasn't quite in love with it. I gave it a 6/10, and moved on.

Originally jailed for armed robbery in the seventies, Bronson's refusal to button down to porridge - and ambition to become a ""name"" in prison, saw him take hostages, stage protests and fight many prison guards at a time. His resultant extended sentence of a staggering thirty four years of prison have seen him spend twenty six years in solitary confinement, a spell in an insane asylum and a total of one hundred and twenty four days of parole/freedom. With each small burst of freedom on the outside, Bronson realised he was ill suited to a world fast outpacing him - he is a king and a legend in prison, however and one of the strong messages of the film is that he would rather suffer the slings and arrows of jail than operate in a world he could not fathom.",2009

We're supposed to believe it's about solidarity among a group of women friends and it is, but that's more-or-less an accident. It's really about consuming  clothes, purses, shoes  and other human beings. The introduction of Jennifer Hudson (who tries really hard not to be appalled by the level of minstrel-show tokenism her presence represents) as Carrie's personal assistant is so painful and so blatant an attempt to give a tiny bit of color to the TV series' snow-blinding whiteness that you can't help but be embarrassed for absolutely everyone. Here's another film in which women are stand-ins for what is essentially a gay-male fantasy about women (an art form that George Cukor pioneered in 1939 with _The Women_) Take your brain out and store it in Tupperware for the evening; _Sex and the City_ will make you smile, but not laugh out loud. If you spend a minute thinking about it, though, all it's going to do is make you mad.",2008
4,"I took my girlfriend to see this movie last night at the 12:01 showing. She is a huge fan of the show, has every season on DVD, and has seen all the episodes multiple times. I have watched 30-40 episodes I would guess and I would not say that I love the show, but I do find it entertaining and never dreaded my girlfriend pulling out the DVDs to pop them in. So going into it I was there 75% for her and 25% because I genuinely thought it would be an entertaining movie even though it would never make it into my top anything.",2008
4,"'Sex and the City,' based on the hilarious, poignant HBO comedy series of the same name, is grossly insulting. In a strong divorce from the series, the movie picks up five years after the series finale - where we find out that each one of the characters have become vapid, soulless versions of their former selves. Now, writer Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker), and her friends Miranda Hobbes (Cynthia Nixon), Samantha Jones (Kim Cattrall), and Charlotte Goldenblatt (Kristen Davis) walk around New York obsessing over shoes, handbags, and love.

4,"While the TV-series, as Bushnells chronicles, was kind of shallow and well... stupid, in some respects, SATC did have a certain zing and friskiness, and it was entertaining and even at times exciting to take part of Carrie's and the others lives. It carried a slight feminist edge, as women had rarely been portrayed talking relationships and sex in a candid way, before. ",2009

1,"Yet another TV show {yawn} becomes a film. A gaggle of successful late thirty something women bitch, moan, and in general treat men like dirt as they wear designer clothes, try on shoes, live in overpriced apartment in gentrified neighborhoods,, advance their careers, attend fashion shows , go shopping ,and in general do the same thing they did in the late-and unlamented series. This disaster is overlong- 2 and a half hours- and, believe me it IS a chore to sit through. For die-hard fans only. The kind of movie that men get dragged to, and have to admit they liked to please their dates. It gives ""chick flicks"" their bad name. You've seen it all before-and better too. At least the girls are good to look at{and fantasize about} and provide decent eye candy, but thats about it.Now don't get me wrong. I can enjoy a well made and well acted ""woman's film"" just as much as the next guy, but this one just ain't it.If all this is not bad enough, there are more product placements in this film then you can shake a stick at.

8,"The last film I saw that offered an equally dark and twisted view of the human psyche, was Pasolini's Salo: a glimpse of something truly dehumanizing and a portrayal of the triumph of evil. SATC works along the same lines, establishing characters without any redeeming qualities, absolutely devoid of decency and empathy. At a certain level, one can see the film as some sort of uber-feminist dystopia, replete with scenes of symbolic castration; or maybe some sort of super-consumerist manifesto, where existence is distilled as lifestyle and an hymn to superficiality; or maybe as a nihilistic social commentary, where self-centeredness and egotism are systematically rewarded.",2008
1,"BIG MISTAKE! I should have begged her to pull the trigger. This movie is nothing more than an emotional fix for females. For me, it was sheer torture. I thought it would never end. It simply goes on and on with one emotional ""crisis"" after another. In other words going nowhere. At 145 minutes, it was a form of punishment. Of course SHE LOVED IT. Do yourself a favor and fake illness, or a death in the family, whatever it takes to avoid having to endure ""Sex and the City"". It's going to take me a week to recover. Oh, did I mention this movie is 145 minutes? You have been warned. Start thinking of excuses immediately, or you will be very sorry. I know I am. - MERK",2008

3,"Fans of the show will be happy to see the ladies from the HBO series unite once again, but really it would have been better for all concerned if they hadn't bothered because this plot less and pointless big screen rehash diminishes the series. The transfer to the big screen at 2hrs and 25mins exposes the hollowness of the characters that the breezy 1/2 hour episodes concealed, and the film is truly 40 minutes too long. And while the ladies and the world have changed in the ten years since the series began, the movie barely acknowledges this fact. Yes, Jennifer Hudson is on board to demonstrate cultural diversity, but the character is unnecessary. SATC:The Movie appeases its target audience with fashion montages, male nudity, spacious closets, and American Pie humor for giddy schoolgirls. The men are upstaged by the Louis Vuitton bags and Mr. Big is passive and colorless. The director's inexperience in the medium is palpable, and the movie feels like 5 episodes of the series drained of blood, and played back to back. The movie isn't very funny; it lacks true wit and polish, and some of what the script thinks is funny, is embarrassing, and apparently SATC2 is all of the above and worse, so I'll finish the franchise with this limp vehicle. All of the 4 leads have their moments, the girls still have the same chemistry that made the series popular, and as on the series, Cattrall's Samantha is still my favorite.",2008
4,"There's something distinctly misguided and wrong with Sex and the City and it lies in its atmosphere as well as its approach to its material. I don't think it knows what it wants to be and ends up several things, usually all at once. Is it a light and fluffy comic piece about contemporary life in one of the world's largest cities? Or is it some sort of harrowing look at breaking up with someone? Or maybe it's supposed to be some kind of escapist fable about friendship and pulling through amidst thick, thin and everything in-between. The thing is it's so all over the place, and at over two hours long the film most definitely outstays its welcome, that it's everything before ending on a note that reeks of some kind of false, circular journey we're supposed to think the lead characters have been through.",2009

That's what happens when the small TV screen is transplanted to the big Cinema screen. The truth comes out. Remember Bill Cosby's translation? Over 2 hours of the most excruciating dissection of characters I hope I'll never meet. The Make Up, the wardrobe, the dialog! Really depressing. I was admonished by a Sex and the City devotee because I was appalled at the movie without having ever seen the TV series. Okay, I plead guilty to that and that's only why I'm giving it a 2 and not a 1.",2008
2,"I'm a gay man who willingly saw this with one of my close friends FOR FREE and I think it was the biggest piece of trash I've seen in a long while. The film shifted focus between like seven different plot-lines (most of them better than the main story), The character's actions had NO motivation at all other than for convenient scenes and it was two and a half tedious hours of middle age women spending money frivolously and doing things that made no sense! Some of the laziest writing i've ever seen coupled with mediocre acting and melodrama at it's worst really paints a portrait of how women are perceived in pop culture today. Give them a man and a louis vuitton bag and they'll live happily ever after. It makes me sick that this was even green lit while potentially great scripts gather dust on shelves somewhere.",2008
8,"Nobody is quite there in this new bright farce by the Coen brothers. The plot is a smart excuse for a movie about nothing but appearing to be about a lot of things. Going backwards and forwards at the same time. Talk about ""The Russians?"" or planning to write a memoir. Brad Pitt is priceless and the innocence of his character is so believable that I wondered how many more surprises this actor has up his sleeve. He is a joy. George Clooney is also terrific and the Coens move through their crossed purposes with speed and elegance. I was totally immerse in their universe even if I didn't quite care what was going on. John Malkovich, Frances McDormand, Richard Jenkins and the unnerving Tilda Swinton complete the package of this movie that feels as if it was made for the sheer pleasure of it.",2008
9,"The point here is that this movie is for adults, with adult themes and adult situations. As with all Coen brother movies, there are going to be people who love it and people that hate it. There doesn't seem to be much middle ground. I loved this movie. It was entertaining, dark and very funny. I really liked ""No Country for Old Men"" but I have to say, ""Burn After Reading"" was a more enjoyable film for me. Some of the reviews here have said that the film rambles around pointlessly, without any clear direction; well I have to disagree, if you are paying attention and you are an adult, you should have no problem understanding what is going on. The best part of the movie is watching this great cast perform brilliantly with the odd-ball material they are given. They are all straight men for the Coen brother's antics. There is violence, bad language, and everyone is sleeping with everyone else, especially George Clooney. But the movie is very funny and while the rest of Hollywood seems to have lost there way, the Coen brothers continue to put out intelligent, entertaining and thought provoking material.",2008
3,"It makes me sad that, with such great actors to work with, the best the Coens could do is make a mish-mash comedy/drama/horror that was lukewarm at best and boring at its worst. I felt sorry for the actors; they had so little of interest to say or do. I almost fell asleep about 20 minutes in. Where was the madcap screwball comedy? Where was the dark ironic humor? It was all just one-dimensional darkness. Where was the good editing? (i.e. we never saw Clooney holding the gun but we know he shot Pitt in the closet.) Instead we get pointless, morose and dull. This movie coulda been a contender. These characthers coulda been somebody. Instead they're really just forgettable. And that's just a waste.",2008

Joel and Ethan have enjoyed so much success and have made so many great films that they would be allowed a poor film. 'Burn After Reading' shook my faith in the Coen Brothers whom I greatly admire. It isn't just bad it's jaw droopingly awful. It's 'I want my rental fee back' bad. It's maybe I forget 'Big Lebowski' or 'O, Brother Where Art Thou?' and skip your next comedy bad.

1,"""No Country for Old Men"" directors Joel and Ethan Coen's uneven, overwrought, misanthropic comedy of errors ""Burn After Reading"" should have been burned after they made it. Remember, the Coen Brothers won the 2008 Best Picture Oscar for their inspired but violent account of an indestructible hit-man who methodically tracked down his victims and killed them without a qualm. As their first feature since ""No Country for Old Men, ""Burn After Reading"" radiates barely a modicum of the customary Coen luminosity. The fourteenth movie that the two brothers have helmed together struggles to be as side-splitting as either ""The Big Lebowski"" or ""Oh, Brother, Where Art Thou."" Instead, this forgettable farce turns out to be as mirthless as two previous Coen misfires ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" and ""Intolerable Cruelty."" ""Burn After Reading"" opens like a Tom Clancy techno-thriller. An orbiting spy satellite camera zooms into the Chesapeake Bay area on the East Coast, penetrates the cloud cover and pinpoints C.I.A. Headquarters in Langley, Virginia. A bow-tied, bald-headed, Princeton-educated, career C.I.A. analyst, Osborne 'Ozzie' Cox (John Malkovich of ""Being John Malkovich""), explodes with rage when his boss (David Rasche of ""An Innocent Man"") relieves him of his duties on the Balkans desk and shuffles him off to a lower security grade State Department post. The volatile Cox spews profanity when his colleagues attribute his inferior job performance to alcoholism. Cox quits the C.I.A. rather than being reassigned. As he storms out of the room, he vows to pen a tell-all memoir. Later, every time we see Ozzie working on his memoirs, he clutches a drink in his fist.",2008
9,"After their Oscar winning turn last year, The Coen Brothers are back with the new film, this time comedy/crime/spy story which is very funny, very dark, quite angry, at times surreal, always ironic and to put it simply a must see for any Coens' fan which means a fan of great movie making. Comparing to the last year's Oscar Winner, No Country for Old Men, their new film may seem much lighter and provides many laughs. But keep in mind, it is comedy: Coens' style and it means that not always the most likable characters get what they look for. As much as the film is funny, it actually paints very disturbing picture about stupidly, idiocy, incompetence, inability to see one step ahead of your actions that keep filling every aspect of our existence with dangerous speed. I loved it - from the very first scene to the end. I laughed a lot, enjoyed the dialogs and the acting. How could I not with the dream cast that include John Malkovich, Tilda Swinton, George Clooney, Francis McDormand, and very funny and deliciously clueless, Brad Pitt, and many familiar faces in the small cameos. George Clooney who has made three films with The Coens got the funniest scenes, and gave IMO one of his best performances. John Malkovich has got to come out of his semi-retirement and act more. His every appearance in the film as forced to quit his job, very angry CIA Analyst who then decided to write a memoir, was a blast. Tilda Swinton as an arrogant icy cold professional woman, and Frances MacDormand as Linda who would stop at nothing in order to ""re-invent herself"", both added to the film's multiple delights.",2008
1,"This has to be the lamest attempt at a movie plot in the Cohen brothers' career. This movie attracted viewers solely on their name alone. Brad Pitt was the shining jewel in this travesty and he gets the ax, BY ACCIDENT!!! Who the puck cares about Linda's 4 part surgery. It's just to make herself feel better? She was obviously too ignorant to realize that she looked beautiful to those around her and it wasn't like it was a necessary or life saving procedure. Ozzy Cox was totally on the rebound after the shyt hits the fan with his wife divorcing him and what does he get? A COMA. Nice. He could have dished out some vengeance on those succeeding in make his life hell but NO. Everyone is sleeping with everyone which connects people unknowingly yet no one really gets found out. Thank you for movie tension that goes nowhere. The Russians waste even more time by telling the dimwitted protagonists that their information on Cox is ultimately useless. Scenes of Clooney building his ""Mystery Machine"" kills you slowly when its only to find out that its a ""Sit on it and Go Puck Yourself"" Machine. Literally!!! The chair he secretively builds has a pucking dildo in it that goes up and down as the occupant, I imagine, moves back and forth while seated. OM-F-G HILARIOUS!!! If I'm gonna shell out 10 clams i should walk away from the the theater going, ""Dam, that was a good movie!! I can't wait to talk about it with my friends!"" Not, "" Why the did i pay to see that? It might as well have been a movie length commercial."" To be Honest, I happened to thoroughly enjoy the Cohen brothers work and they had yet to disappoint until i saw this skid mark of a film. Watching this is like ""peeling your bark"" without ""falling a tree"". You sit there, hacking away at waves of build up and tension, waiting for the climax to make sense of all this and NO. All you get is a cramp in your hand and a hole in your wallet where a 10 spot used to be. Meanwhile, The Cohen Brothers are laughing all the way to the bank. I know some of you reading this may totally disagree. Fair enough. All I know is that I wasn't the only one NOT laughing in the theater. And yes i know it wasn't supposed to be a comedy. But that's the only thing this movie had going for it and even that was scarce. Comparatively, No Country For Old Men was fantastic. If they were gonna do drama, do it like that. And The Big Lebowski was hysterical! If they wanted to do a comedy, they nailed it right on the head with that one. Even that movie had awkward situations that involved bumbling idiots who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and yet everyone walks away a little wiser and a lesson learned. But mix the 2 and you get an abortion of a film that is the one I'm trying to save you from watching. The point of a good movie, no matter what genre, should be that the viewer walks away WITH something. In this case, Run the hell away cause you ain't getting shyt. Now go buy a dime and thank me for helping you make a better investment than a ticket to this fecal filled feature of phucked uptitude. NEXT!!!",2008
1,The only thing funny about this movie is when Brad Pitt gets punched in the face and the chair George Clooney makes in his basement! Other than that this movie is slow going and has no point what so ever. Why the hell is Ozzy's wife important. other than the fact she's a b*tch? A lot of the boring crap could have been cut out and you would have had the same result but then the movie would have been a half hour long. It was supposed to be a comedy but all the funny stuff was shown in the previews. They wasted a great cast on a crap movie! I will say that George Clooney was the best one in the movie. Take what you want from this and leave the rest. I didn't like it but you might.,2009
8,I saw the film at the 65th Venice Film Festival yesterday. The red carpet was a huge attraction of course with Brad Pitt and George Clooney. I'm not surprised to tell you that the Coens will not disappoint any fans with Burn After Reading.,2008
8,"The Coen Brothers are an interesting pair, there's no doubt about that. Just as they did back in the 1980's with their debut and sophomore films, the Coens chose to follow up their most heavy-handed and serious film since Blood Simple, No Country for Old Men, with a nutty, over-the-top screwball black comedy. But unlike their second film, Raising Arizona, the Coens deliver Burn After Reading with a kind of newfound cynicism attached to it; it's funny, but it's also surprisingly dark and sad, and even poignant to some extent.",2008
5,"Wacky Coen Brothers film that should on the page work, but in actuality falls flat. The story is about John Malkovich a disgruntled CIA agent who quit in order to write his memoirs. The disc is lost and it becomes a scramble between a bunch of twits in order to get their hands on the information contained with in. Well acted, well written the film falls flat because however the Coens put the film together it drains the humor out of the situations. I mean there were things that made me laugh in the trailer that just sort of washed over me with out a ripple in the film. I have no idea what happened. Its good after a fashion and better than the things like The Lady Killers, but its still not say Lebowski or one of their lesser films.",2009
5,"This is a very dark movie. There wasn't a single character I felt any empathy for. The Brad Pitt character was just too stupid to be respected. The Frances McDormand character was really hideous at heart. I guess the gym owner was sympathetic, but I felt what happened to him was just ridiculous. ",2008
9,"There is a idea that great movies come from Hollywood once in a blue moon. If it's true, Burn After Reading is definitely one of them. It makes you scare, it makes you thrill moreover - this might be awkward- it makes you also laugh. All these are mixed in a scenario which I haven't seen so creative for awhile. It's like a math problem. And just like it, your mind working through the movie. Keeping guess that who's dealing who. I recommend this movie especially for crime movie lovers. They will find unique tastes from it but even if you are not a fan of genre, it doesn't matter because either way, you'll watch a movie which has been dished up ",2010
10,"And casting, let's not forget that. The Coen brothers, usually writing with specific actors in mind, have placed some of Hollywood's biggest and some of the plain best actors around in parts in Burn After Reading that test them to how far they can take the material before it spontaneously combusts. Maybe it does. While their film does start a little slow, if not too much so, their plot soon requires all of the actors- some Coen regulars big and small, some new- to act stupid, angry, confused, wacko, desperate, going nuts, and generally in characteristic form of a Coen comedy, which is far and beyond a distinct step above a lot of other zany/dark comedies. Thankfully, they all meet the challenge.",2008
10,"I have read several reviews, and I was amazed at one in particular. That one review focused on how only adults would be able to grasp the significance and beauty of the film as a film. I completely and utterly disagree. I am, what some would call, a child. I am sixteen years old. Not old enough to even see the movie alone, though I did. I loved the movie, the humor, as is the case with all Coen brother movies, was indeed dark. The story had a wonderful arch. It was simply well made and well acted. Though i would have to say, from the perspective of an actor, John Malchovich's character seemed to have nowhere to go. It reached the zenith in the first scene. Yes he was a misanthropic, smart-ass, jerk, for lack of a better word, but his anger peaked then had nowhere to go but down. So anyone who still believes that only an adult audience member could even understand or enjoy this film, think again.",2008
1,"I give this film a 1 for ""awful!"" I am a longtime Coen brothers fan ever since Blood Simple, and the funniest movie i have ever seen is - hands down - The Big Lebowski. I was thus expecting to be amused by a cast of quirky characters in a masterfully woven plot that entertains but also says something deeper about life. The cast here is classic Coen; the characters are classic Coen, but somehow all this potential did not add up to equal FUNNY. I really don't know enough about film-making to posit why this is the case.",2008
1,"If you are a fan of horror films, then you have probably seen Scream. In it, Randy, the resident expert of the idiocy of horror movies, gives you the rules of horror films. In it he tells of all the things you should do in a horror film, but end up not doing anyway. I think this film is inspired by Randy's dialogue in Scream. This is the most clichéd horror film in the history of clichéd horror films. Comparing this to Halloween or the Shining makes me throw up in my mouth a little. It is just plain blasphemy. This is nothing like the greats from the 70's and the 80's. It's not even as good as CHUD, Friday the 13th or any other decent but flawed horror film.",2008
2,"Can we finally acknowledge that horror films have largely turned into another genre, that of sadism? There is a huge difference between film bloodshed and gore that is a part of a horrific/suspenseful scenario, and that which is done so the audience can watch people undergo agony, as in the 'Hostel' franchise. I can't take it. It is not scary; it's just disgusting. As in this film. Take away the idiot decisions about the gun, going outside, leaving your girl alone in an isolated home after a freak comes by, calling for help, etc., and there's the making for good, scary suspense. Turn it into an exercise in extended sadism, and it's purely gratuitous in a disturbing way. Do people actually think it's 'scary' or 'suspenseful' to watch the girl beg for her life, as she sees her guy stabbed and stabbed? It's not. It's unrelenting misery and there's something way wrong with anyone who thinks it's good filmmaking. The strangers were extremely terrifying, and there are psychopaths out there. But this nightmare of torture and sadism is NOT a great scary movie (which I love as a genre), or suspenseful. It's mean and ugly, and what scares me is how torture is the new horror.",2012
1,"*** Warning *** Spoilers *** For such a short film, this managed to cram in every senseless cliché of the so-called horror genre. '...Girl runs from bad guys, girl trips, girls falls and hurts herself, girl whimpers, duh...' No character development, no depth, no sympathy for the characters. '... bad guys are harassing your house and threatening you, so OF COURSE you get hysterical, cry, and seek out every spooky noise...' So bad guys are hacking at your front door with an ax, you've got a loaded shotgun in your hand, but you don't shoot, you throw a chair at the door, Oh Wait, I've got a gun! But by the time you think to shoot the bad guys are gone. So your under attack from bad guys and it's just you, your girlfriend, and a loaded shotgun, so instead of hunkering down and letting them come to you to get shot, you leave your girlfriend alone in the un-secured house while you wander off to the tool shed to find and old ham radio. Sure, makes sense. So you go visit your friends and someone shoots out your windshield, do you: A- drive off fast and call 911, B- call 911 then run in the house to check on your friends, or C- dust yourself off, sneak into the house quietly, without ever bothering to wonder why your friend's car is wrecked, who's pickup truck that is, why the house is trashed, don't bother turning off the loud stereo, or calling out your friends' names, in fact don't even bother to look behind you to see if maybe the people who shot out your windshield are still around. That's right - C !?!Everyone who died in this movie deserved to die for being such mindless, spineless, insipid, whimpering idiots.

5,"Like many, I went into this (knowing) the basics of the story. That being said, I found the first half of the film quite suspenseful and creepy by modern movie standards. The story begins by developing the relationship between it's two stars, then separating them and introducing the terror. This worked, and worked very well in it's ability to set up (and scare the hell out of) the viewers. Unfortunately, after we have established what is taking place, the story seems to slow to a simmer, and eventually fizzles out. The second half of the film is filled with horror movie cliché's and cheap scare tactics, almost to the point of boredom... It's a shame, because I haven't been a fan of slasher films since the eighties, and I REALLY wanted to ""Like"" this film.",2008

YOU HAVE THE GUN...you could've waited inside the room and shoot the hell out the killers if they come in. if you missed, you're girlfriend's there with the knife, you could've helped each other out, oh wait she doesn't the knife or anything.. 5. would you leave your girlfriend inside the house knowing that they're everywhere, to hunt the killer in the woods? why would you even go to the woods? and you have the gun and your girlfriend has no weapon??? how inconsiderate!!!! and if i were the girl, i would never let my boyfriend out of sight. i will come with you with a knife, wherever you go. at least we can die together. 6. if you stumble in a barn complete with all the deadly, pointy things things you can see, wouldn't you take anything to protect yourself or maybe try and kill the killers? you could've found another axe there. 7. killers: kill them already, what's the point in all this scary tactics if you're just gonna stab them. no gruesome whatsoever. nothing imaginable. just plain kind of like a drunken stabbing incident. that's it. why wait till the morning and change her clothes, when you could've captured them right away and torture them to death instead. some stab-happy killers. 8. in the beginning of the movie, the narrator said it they still don't know what happened. his voice made it sound like it's so gruesome. and the 2 boys who called 911 i believe. they saw the killers.. didn't the police interview thwem and maybe get a sketch out of them????? they were staring at the killers for more a than 2 min, they could've remember what they looked like exactly... 9. oh and let's not forget the ever so cliché ending where you think the victim'as and then suddenly move..... 10. this movie is dragging and is so slow, you'd want the killers to just kill them already. no characted development either. for any of them...and one of the killers has asthma to add some creepyness...",2008
1,"This film is a turd of a turdwellian turdmeister to the turd power. Lets see, a lot of implausible stuff - baddies who can appear and disappear at will, one baddie maybe six feet tall the two others waifish and barely five feet tall against two healthily built people with a shotgun and a lot of magnum shells, victims who just don't want to lock their doors in the face of this sudden brutality, big open swaths of land outside their front door in which the victims could have fled in any number of directions and -o.k. o.k. no more. I guess the movie would have been over in twenty minutes if it tried to remotely approach a tiny little slice of believability.",2008
1,"I couldn't even get through this movie. The whole first 45 minutes revolves around trying to explain the fact that they can't go for help and it's just ridiculous. First of all, nobody leaves their house without their phone charged. Liv Tyler's character goes out to dinner and when she comes home her phone is dead. Sure. Second, she manages to get to her land line when someone is trying to break into her house. Does she call 911? Nooooo....she calls the boyfriend asking him to come home. Then the land line goes dead. The boyfriend manages to make it home, but *gasp* leaves his cell in his car. He goes out to get the cell and *gasp* it's gone. While he's outside does he go to a neighbor's house for help? Noooo...he goes back inside. Then they decide they have to get out of there so they make it to the car. When they get to the street, they see a car coming at them, so they stop instead of trying to avoid the other car and go around. Then they see a car coming at them from behind. Do they gun the car and go around the one in front? Noooo....they sit there and get hit from behind. What to do now? Run back into the house, of course. I couldn't take any more at this point. Both of them are so useless I don't even care if they get killed at this point.",2008
4,"As everyone probably anticipated, this film is another in a seemingly endless string of unbearable formulaic pap that Hollywood has been spewing out for the past nine billion years. This film wasn't exactly horrible, and I admit I was hoping against all reason that it might succeed at least a tiny bit in creating an eerie mood and generating some genuine scares, but no, that's just too much to ask for. Without going in to too much detail, I can tell you that the first 30 minutes or so are sort of creepy, but the rest is nothing but cheap, unnecessarily noisy scares and way too many glimpses of these totally unintimidating people in stupid looking masks. And yes, as the previews implied, the movie really does revolve entirely around the gimmick that these people are wearing scary looking masks. And that's it. The highlight of the movie, for me, was the ""hey that's the dude from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia!"" part. So if you like watching Liv Tyler's upper lip continue to be bigger than her lower lip and people in stupid masks walking around banging on things, this is the movie for you. Oh, and it's completely anti-climactic as well. A true Hollywood gem.",2008
1,"Oh my freaking god this needs to be the last, I'm a dumb bitch and got killed by dumber murders movie ever. Holy Christ in Heaven, frosty the snowman is scarier than this damn movie. Freaking god, it was one hour and twenty minutes of me wanting Liv Tyler to hurry up and die, and damn it all if she didn't live. It doesn't take an hour to kill two morons, trust me. In fact, I could have killed them all seventeen and half times over by then. Seinfeld was scarier. Dora the damn Explorer is scarier. Quit acting Liv Tyler and other pointless guy no one cares about. Quit directing Bryan, you have NO talent. This movie was free and I demand my $34 dollars back for life wasted. At least cigarettes tell you you're about to lose some of your life. Seriously.",2008

2,"I have used IMDb for years but have never registered to submit a review. However, after reading positive reviews on The Strangers and actually having it compared to ""The Shining"" and possibly being the best horror movie ever I HAD to comment.",2008
1,"Let me start by saying that I like scary movies...but to be effectively scary, a movie has to follow some coherent internal logic. This one doesn't. Characters in a good scary movie ought to behave--at least initially--as though their brains were functioning. These characters don't. There's nothing wrong with gore and brutality--assuming they're used for some reason. No rhyme or reason here. A group of masked kids terrorize a young couple who, as the film unwinds, behave inexplicably--leaving each other alone at moments where it makes no sense to do so, failing to make use of potential weapons at their disposal until it is, conveniently, too late for the weapons to do any good. Why does all this happen? Who knows? Who cares? Fairness compels me to point out that most of the audience--almost exclusively between the ages of 13 and 15 (which should have tipped us off) spend the entire length of the movie screaming constantly, which, I imagine, was why they'd come. To suggest that this film deserves remotely to be compared with films like ""Psycho,"" ""Silence of the Lambs,"" or ""Alien""...well, I'm at a loss for words that aren't too tasteless for this forum. What a criminal waste of celluloid.",2008
4,"First off, let's start with a note. It was 'inspired' not 'based' off true events. People need to learn the difference between the two. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is 'inspired' by true events, but still people believe it really happened. It never happened... it was inspired by the story of the serial killer Ed Gein who would take body parts off of women and make furniture out of them, and other forms of cruelty.The Strangers was 'inspired' by true events which means they probably took similarities from stories of The Manson killings and other killings of the same sort. So really the director had free range to do whatever the hell he wanted at the end, and I believe he failed.",2008
1,"This movie starts out contrived and goes down hill from there. We see an attractive couple coming home from a social engagement. The man is sad and moody, the woman crying silently to herself. Through clumsy flashbacks we learn that the young man proposed marriage and his willowy flame said she was not ready for such a commitment. They come home, mope about for a while, almost have sex and are then terrorized by masked killers. I guess we are supposed to identify with the young couple because they are young and attractive. We have nothing else to go on because the characterization is so sketchy and lazy. Even archetypes need some sort of specificity in order to engender audience identification. The filmmaker's are proceeding from the premise that audiences don't care about character development and just want to get to the sadism. Perhaps for certain brain dead twenty somethings this will be enough. I was bored with the film from the word go. Every scene that is supposed to be suspenseful has been ripped off from another much better thriller. This film is a combination of Halloween and Scream with a little torture porn thrown in at the end for desperation's sake. The beautiful Liv Tyler is utterly wasted in a role that requires her to act like a mentally challenged five year old. A strange woman with obviously menacing intentions bangs on Tyler's door repeatedly. Instead of trying to contact the police, Tyler lights a cigarette, charges her cell phone, puts on a different outfit, calls her boyfriend on her house phone and generally behaves like a moron. It is hard to sympathize with someone who does not have one shred of a survival instinct. The killers have no motivation and stalk and kill the couple because they enjoy behaving in hateful and psychotic ways. Frankly the young couple is so useless and shallow it is hard to feel any sense of loss. The entire film is shot with hand held shaky cam techniques that the filmmaker's obviously hope will pass for a style. The only tension I felt while watching the film was a growing sense of annoyance that it was not over yet. The sense of dread and fun that is found in a masterpiece like Halloween is completely absent in this robotic-ally sadistic film. The film-making and script-writing are so lazy it is insulting. The couple is stalked and then they are killed in a brutal and obvious fashion. Somehow this process takes over an hour and a half to occur. For young audiences I suppose the payoff is the couple being killed with the stalking as some sort of foreplay. I truly do not understand the appeal of films like this. At least Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street attempted some sort of mythology. A film like this is a sad example of the limited and unimaginative fodder that passes for horror today. The only thing I really took away from this trash was a depressing feeling that what really excites people now is watching anonymous human suffering. If you are considering watching this piece of garbage I would recommend watching the artful and terrifying foreign thriller entitled ""Them.""",2008

They basically had the same plot just instead of Jason, you have strangers. I actually think the Friday the 13ths took more thought and had better scenes than this film did. I mean, the whole movie was about putting this couple through hell until the buildup and then there should have been a better ending. But no, all this buildup just to show them tied up and stabbed. It didn't even show that. What was the writer of this crap thinking? This film could have become another Texas Chainsaw Massacre if it had a better story behind it. But instead, it's a piece of crap.",2008
1,"I was watching the extras portion of this DVD for only one reason: I desperately desired an explanation for the reasons behind the making of this film. After all, when I've just been bludgeoned with ninety minutes of unmotivated, gratuitous violence, all without justification, I feel I am owed that explanation. I was expecting to be disappointed when suddenly, during the last minute, the director finally revealed his motivations. It seems his goal was to put the viewer right there with the victims. ""If the audience feels like they were there, then I'll be happy."" I see. So then... trying to impart to the viewer a sense of what it feels like to be terrorized and brutally murdered is his lofty goal? What kind of sick mind constructs a film based upon such reasonings? ",2008
7,"We all know the plot: young couple, isolated vacation home, people in masks. Yet from the start of 'The Strangers' it's clear that this film is a different. In today's bloodthirsty society, horror films are often reduced to nothing more than gore-filled gross-out fests. While many young teens may rejoice at such films, many of us still long for original, suspenseful, and, yes, terrifying horror movies. 'The Strangers' came so close.",2008
1,load of crap man. this movie sucked and was pointless to sit and watch an 100 min. movie to see them get killed in the gayest way I've ever seen in a horror movie the only part that even phased me was when Liz Tyler opened the curtains and u saw the man in the mask there otherwise its a load of predictable crap in real life they would of went there and killed them in a minute not an hour and 20 minutes. bottom line this movie SUCKED don't waste your money on it. i think it was mostly the directors fault to i mean how can a movie be this bad. they needed a better budget or something. i would rather watch the old Halloween 50 times before i would watch this again,2008
2,"It was not 1 star awful... I actually liked the way the drama unfolded in the beginning. It made me think that I was in for a real head-trip once the madness got underway. But nope. It was like watching a watered-down, drawn-out version of The Vacancy. This movie is so ripe for TV that I would bet that there's a version already edited (would probably take only two seconds to do) and ready to go. If you're into Scooby Doo chills & thrills The Strangers is a must see. Oh yes... and you also get the I've fallen and I can't get up, I'll run back into the house because there is nowhere else to run on this great green earth, and perhaps the lamest of lame... I'll run into a closet because it is small and dark. Bo-ring!",2008
10,"Saw the screening for this film and it was truly terrifying. The whole audience was screaming at parts and there are several scenes that make you jump. The tension buildup during the movie is incredible. Some of the scenes are disturbing but not overly gory. Liv Tyler does a convincing job of making you feel the fright and a lot of the acting is non-verbal. Scott Speedman also does an excellent and believable job. With todays crazy headlines, this is the kind of movie that you can actually imagine happening somewhere in this country in real life. Trust me, at the end of this movie you will be double checking the locks on your doors and windows.",2007
8,"I laughed more in this movie than in any other of its ilk. Mostly thanks to James Franco. Yes, the James Dean Franco. His comedic timing is startling and his sympathy is all consuming. I think the secret is that we can (Franco allows us) see the human being behind this irresistible caricature. I was totally taken by the strange kind of innocence he exudes. We sense a loyal buddy who is capable of extraordinary generosity. His smile is already an iconic movie landmark. Seth Rogen is also very funny but you can guess that this is actually his character. Nothing wrong with that but James Franco's range is infinite. David Gordon Green makes his ""commercial debut"" very successfully. The showdown at the end takes a bit too long but all in all this movie is throughly worth it.",2008
10,"I was not interested in seeing this movie as I thought it would be a stupid teen story. My daughter went with her older cousins, she is only 16 and since the theater had strict security I was forced to go in as her guardian. I am 46 years old and I laughed the whole entire movie. By the end I was laughing SO hard that I could not take it anymore. I think I laughed more than the kids. There were so many laugh out loud scenes and the interaction between the characters was pure gold.It really took me back to my younger days-so for you older people this is really one movie you do not want to miss. Be sure to go to the bathroom before because this is definitely one of those pee in your pants movies.",2008
4,"Bummer, The one great word to describe this movie. I Really expected this movie to be a lot better. It was a major disappointment. The movie was way too long, it had a lot of failed comedy in it, and it really over exaggerated Pot smokers. Ill admit some stuff was funny in it but it was definitely a let down. Im not quite sure how this movie managed to make it into theaters, and also I do not get why James Franco would even agree to such a stupid movie and part. If I could I would love to get my $7USD back and go see the dark knight again. At least that movie wasn't a let down like this one. My overall rating for this film is a 4/10",2008
4,"This started out as funny & clever and completely fell apart in the second half of the movie. For the first half, I'd give it close to an 8 and for the second a zero, so we'll average out at a solid 4. The second half ceased to be funny or clever and turned into one long, idiotic cliché. Honestly, it really felt like we lost our original set of writers & directors after an hour and they had to find a replacement set from some cheesy action movie. It totally came off the tracks when our light-hearted stoners picked up machine guns along with the rest of the thugs. Did the writers quit smoking weed and start doing meth or something? How could this have started so good and ended up such crap? I don't think I could be more disappointed after all the hype this movie has received.",2008

1,"I really didn't expect much from this film,and I got less than expected.The film starts out a with a few used moments from Super Bad, maybe from the cutting room floor, then it turns into this bad pot action movie with all the crude humor you can squeeze in. The plot seemed basic and then it became too eccentric. You have a process server who witnesses a murder done by the guy he needs to serve papers to played by Gary Cole, who is wasted by little screen time and bad writing, and by a dirty cop played by Rosie Perez, who is always in uniform, which is kind of dumb that even at the final shoot out, she shows up in uniform. James Franco completely ripped off his character from Brad Pitt's portrayal as a pothead in True Romance, which he stole the scene in the three he was in. We then are introduced to James Franco's supplier ""RED"" who is trying to be like Nick Swardson and doing a bad job at it. The scene with him is long, out played and just goes in every direction except moving the movie forward. Finally Seth Rogen who seems to have phoned in his performance or just played the same guy from Knocked up and Super Bad just gives a performance that irritates you with the best friend lines. Now the movie made me chuckle a few times but the long dragged out scenes and then switching to a fast paced action movie not only confused me, but made me bored. So I give this movie 1 star out of 10 for a few quick funny moments.",2008

8,"There's no doubt about it, Pineapple Express is a relentlessly funny stoner movie, start to finish with little in the way of compromise; telling the story of two stoners, who end up entangled within a drug conspiracy plot that threatens their lives while smoking plenty of pot along the way, this year's latest instalment to the genre is the finest example of dumb -but well delivered- comedy yet. One discrepancy against it's classification as a stoner comedy however lies in that even if you're not high yourself; even if you've never even been high in your life, there's still lots of fun to be had here as the jokes are broad enough in their design to apply to any ridiculous situation. So while the plant obviously makes a starring role here, the focus is not primarily on it, and the movie is better off as a result.",2008
2,"Wow, was I disappointed in this movie! It missed on so many points that I really can't think of anything that was good about it.

1,"I went to watch this film with my friend after seeing it had got a good review, and yes it made us laugh but not because it was funny because it was pointless and made no sense whatsoever. i mean most of the film there either taking drugs or involved in a car chase. then at the end when the barn blows up and because he jumped in what i think was a laundry basket he doesn't die?? then after the building does explode and is still on fire red crawls out alive?? not to mention the fact he was shot twice in his stomach at the start of the film, then 5 times at the end why doesn't he just bleed to death?? then he survives an explosion what is he the bionic man?? i actually considered walking out of the cinema, no wonder there was only 4 of us watching it in the whole cinema. the thing that made me laugh the most though were death scenes, but only because they were so un real and the acting for them was incredibly bad. Who thought this was entertaining?? Then at the end they still aren't at the hospital, i just wished that they had all died as the were insanely annoying, and being shot didn't seem to kill them. This film made me want to fall asleep with its unreal story line, i mean what happens to his girl friend at the end she just seemed to have been cut out of the rest of the film. Then at the start when he sees the murder if he'd have just sat there he wouldn't have been noticed. But no he had to crash in to two cars really loudly so that he could be found out. Then the whole thing with him getting found out because of his drugs?? I'm surprised he even threw it out if he was such an addict he would have kept it. Worst film i have ever seen.

I like Rogan and I like Franko. For the life of me, I can't fathom why they would have read the script and signed-on to do this movie.

Still I wanted to see it, so I went in with low expectations. I laughed out loud through parts of the movie but never really felt fully entertained. By the end of the movie the few moments I had laughed at weren't nearly enough to make the film feel like a satisfying comedic whole.

10,"The Brian Gordon Green directed ""Pineapple Express"" tells the story of Dale Denton (Rogen) and Saul Silver (Franco), two pot-smoking friends who end up becoming deeply involved with a gang ruthless drug dealers. Now, I had always heard ""Pineapple Express"" was a brilliant blend of genres, and that's what it is - a great stoner comedy that successfully blends buddy-action elements into it's story. The script was hilarious, as it's written by Seth Rogen himself and fellow successful screenwriter Evan Goldberg. The comedic elements written into said script ,although low-brow and often dark, came off as very breezy and ended up being one of the key factors of appeal for the film. Though the best part about the film, for me, was the really believable chemistry between James Franco and Seth Rogen. The two have worked together before on the cult television series ""Freaks And Geeks"", and their real-life friendship transfers very beautifully on film. Surprisingly enough, the movie also featured a sufficient amount of thrills and action - especially towards the end. Overall, I found ""Pineapple Express"" to be a delightfully funny buddy-stoner-action-comedy that brought the laughs and surprises in shovelfuls.",2011
2,"I left the theater feeling unclean and also ripped off for paying to see this drivel. 1) It is not funny--there was only sporadic laughter in the packed audience, in contrast to Judd Apatow's much better films. 2) It has a disgusting message--that it is great to be stoned all the time. Despite Seth Rogen's character saying midway through the film that it is a waste to be stoned every day, the final scene in the diner totally contradicts this earlier scene as the three friends are happily stoned again, and loving it! 3) People who get shot up multiple times do not die. Several of the main characters get shot up repeatedly, yet they remain healthy and alive and do not seek out medical assistance. In contrast, the ""bad"" guys all die from their wounds. 4) There is a ""lovely"" scene in which Saul sells pot to underage children--and they are seen enjoying their trips as well. Isn't this a great message to be sending the teenagers who sneak into this R-rated film? 5) The foul language that pervades this film makes ""Step Brothers"" look like a Disney release. When will the writers learn that bad language should be made to make a point, and it loses all shock value when used for no reason and all the time. 6) Seth Rogen again has a gorgeous girlfriend--that he dumps! What beautiful girl with an IQ above 60 would be with the type of person Seth Rogen plays? Is this really plausible? Does anybody really believe that someone like Katherine Heigl in ""Knocked Up"" would ever want to be with someone like Seth Rogen? ",2008
9,"I was lucky enough to see this movie at an advance screening last night, and it was hilarious. Franco's first project with Apatow (in a major role) since ""Freaks and Geeks"" is another hit in the string of adult comedies from Apatow and co. ""Guy humor"" dominates the film (crude, rude, and ""immature""), but everyone can appreciate the brilliant little quips that come out at the most random times, the great little names the characters call each other, and over the top stupidity from the entire cast which you can tell is generally having a good time with the film.

This series is very cleverly written, with lots of painful observations, and excellent characters, brilliantly played. I gave it ten out of ten, as nothing has come close to beating it this year.

Now I understand they have begun to make an American version; No way in ""hell"" will it be able to stand up to the original UK series. The show has non stop laughs and situations that almost anyone can relate to. Hopefully the American version doesn't hurt the good name ""The Inbetweeners"". Also wish channel4.com would allow streaming on demand in for us fans in the US. BEWARE if you watch one episode, you'll be an instant fan. Great job channel 4!!!",2010
10,"A couple of mates with similar senses of humour got me into this during the second series and I have gone back and unearthed the first series. Well worth the effort! British comedy is alive and well in the cult shadows! This is hilarious because it represents a comedic image of how tragic most of our lives were as teenagers. It pulls off the awesome trick of being cool whilst proudly boasting central characters who aren't cool. They're not always nice, even. But they ARE true - and you've gotta love 'em for it! Check this out and laugh your nuts off, whilst guiltily hiding the fact that you were either as lovable yet pathetic as the heroes or as cool, snide and, deep-down, insecure as the bullies.",2009
10,Just brilliant...,2014
9,"It's a common problem of sitcoms that they strain credibility so far in the search for laughs that I have to turn off in irritation. The Inbetweeners manages the twin achievements of a very realistic portrait of horny teenage boys and *funny*. Perhaps because of the commitment to reality. For example, the boys actually talk like me and my mates did at that age; no fecks or fudging, if you know what I mean.",2008

9,STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning ,2009
9,"Anything that has ever happened to any teenager, is mercilessly inflicted upon the four main characters, in a manner which is absolutely hilarious. The characters are portrayed in a manner which is not realistic, but conforms to the stereotypes, giving them strong character, and only increasing the humour of the show, and the circumstances they are put through are masterfully crafted, in a parody of life in the sixth form. You will be sitting laughing so much you cannot breathe, especially with a group of your mates. This show is well worth getting!As a side note, the humour in Inbetweeners is most certainly not for family viewing, containing strong language, and jokes of a sexual nature. Roll on season 3....",2010
10,"Wow. Whilst it's a shame there were only ever 3 series' made of the Inbetweeners, that does feel like the perfect amount. ",2017
8,Will (Simon Bird) is the new kid who transfers in from private to public school and finds it difficult to adjust as he eventually joins a group of outcasts.,2014
9,"When you're 16, you no longer feel like you're a kid. You feel you're worthy of greater respect, that you are in fact, an adult. Legally though, you are NOT an adult. You are beyond certain rules but still trapped by others - you're 'inbetween' childhood and adulthood, so the show's title is certainly accurate.",2014
9,"This is a sitcom series well worth seeing. Not only does it outline the desperation of people in the late teens, but it continuously pokes fun at gulf in social stereotyping at that age too. The situations the four boys find themselves in never grows tired as each individual scenario is both different and hilarious. A must see! It is worth watching them in chronological order as there is underlying back story to a certain degree, but single episodes can be watched as there isn't continuation. The lives of the four boys intertwine to such an extent that their actions invariably affect the life of one of the other's and their interactions and efforts regarding women certainly are pure comic genius. Great comedy and good character building will leave you in stitches guaranteed!!",2014
8,"I think this show is one of the funniest on TV now days, i am sick of seeing comedy shows get on TV that are not funny, that have people on who make it obvious they are trying to get a laugh out of people. This show makes it natural, this is bound to make you laugh out loud. It has it all... humour, a geek, a shy guy, a dumb guy, a sex mad guy and more, i love this.",2014
10,"First came across this show in the ""People who liked this show also like.."" section of IMDb (love that tool, it's just like the recommendations side bar of youtube, brings you to great things) Anywho, I watched the movie, thought it was alright. However I like the show much better. Honestly had me laughing out loud at least a couple times for each episode. It's a very crude sense of humour though, so if you don't find that funny, chances are you won't like the show. ",2012
8,"In looking at the reviews for this show, I saw that only one person outside of the U.K. had reviewed it. Although I didn't agree with there comparison to That 70'S Show, I did agree that this show is hilarious. I have a problem trying to compare it to anything, because I don't think there's anything comparable to it on American television. I guess the biggest thing that sets it apart from American shows, is the dialouge. With word's like sh*t, spunk, bender, bell end, and many others being thrown out so often. It makes me wonder what differences there are in the ratings systems in the U.K. On the B.B.C channel its rated tv14. But if it were an American show it would have to be TVMA. I'm not complaining though. But the premise of the show is a pretty tried an true one, teens trying to get laid, drunk, and all the other things that pop into the adolescent mind. Plenty of laughs, highly recommended.",2010
9,Just finished the 3rd season and it was f****** funny as s***. It's a shame the show only lasted 3 seasons and didn't show up on American TV tell recently. I really loved the difference in British language. It took me a while to catch on to what some of their words meant. I do have to say that it's a little unclear between the movie and the show what happened because i thought Simon was moving away. The best difference is the drinking age. Wish that was the same in America. The throw up was probably the funny part cause it always seemed to happen when things went badly. Glad to know the British can party hard. Well done!!! Well done!!!,2012
10,"I first watched The Inbetweeners when my mate received it for his birthday the first two series. I think it absolutely excellent the guys who have made the show have gave us non stop laughs.

I've tried very hard to get people here in the states to watch it but i don't think it will happen until we butcher it on MTV. but if you have never watched this id highly recommend this seeing as i watch series 1-3 and the movie at least twice a week....",2012

1,Words cannot describe how awful this film is.,2008
5,"Like so many modern Hollywood moves ""wanted"" looks and sounds great but is a poorly conceived and written and is ultimately not a good movie. It's another in a long list of movies that is technically excellent but uninspired and unfulfilling.",2008
1,"I was a bit apprehensive about this film from the previews and commercials, what with the bending bullets and all, but I figured with all of the action movies trying to outdo each other...maybe there would be a good story backing it. However, in the opening sequence, when a man leaps several hundred feet to slay some assassins on another rooftop before being aced out from miles away, I started to lose any hopes for a good movie. Then any further hopes were dashed when it was revealed that a magic god loom delivers a binary code that says who is to be killed (how the frat discovered binary and secondly, that the people named were to be killed is beyond me, maybe god/fate/whatever wrote to them in binary on the first sweater that was and told them to kill the named ever thereafter) This whole god/fate (fate being spelled out when the explosive rat truck hit the mill door) loom thing really blatantly pointed out the problems with dogmatic, irrational beliefs that can be found running rampant throughout our society; but speaking of that society, it's a shame to think that most people will be unable to find that point because it was buried behind quack gimics and special effects. This movie made Crank look like the Godfather. Aside from the absurd story backing why the frat was assassinating people, all of the stunts were merely an attempt to outdo movies like crank with time/space bending cg that makes anyone who has any inkling of what physics are want to cry. If the time-slowing gimics were cut from the movie, I think it would have maybe passed 30 minutes of film time. I could maybe understand the rapid heartbeat to be able to react quicker to things, modeled after a fight or flight type of response on crack or something, but the bullet bending thing got to be a little too ridiculous by the end where a bullet can be fired around a 20' circumference and have the same gun tossed to someone else before the bullet returns from its 360 degree trip to kill the shooter...I mean, really? I really wanted to walk out of the theater about 30 minutes into this film. There isn't enough room in this comment box to enable me to voice the downfalls of this film. However I feel as though I must include this side note on society as well. On top of whole fate and immovable beliefs tangent from above, the fact that movies like this can go over well in America is a great example of how dumbed down culture is making us...Oh let's make an action movie with a loom that dictates who should live and who should die...oh yea...and the assassins can bone physics with no rationale as to how...It truly made me sick. ""What luck for rulers that men do not think."" - Adolf Hitler. It's understandable how we get leaders like George W Bush when movies like this are not only accepted, but admired. Now if you will excuse me, I need to read my binary sweatshirt for what to eat tonight.",2008
1,Suspend all disbelief. There's not a single element of realism in this movie & it's a very sad attempt to try & make a comic into a movie then failing badly as the source material clearly wasn't strong enough.,2008
4,"I am a massive James McAvoy fan since his Shameless(UK) days, so was a bit iffy on how he would transfer to an action movie. Despite a fair performance from him (even if his American accent is hard to believe and turns back to his native Scottish every now and then), my friend who dragged me along apologised profusely once the film had finished. Here's some of my problems with the film. ",2008
2,"This film is saturated with absurdity, in an attempt to wow audiences with special effects they have already seen countless times in the likes of Die Hard and Bourne. Nothing new in this film, just a number of Hollywood cliché's, including the sob story told by a narrator in the third person, which ultimately turns out to be their own sob story, and even the Star Wars idea of the central character seeking to avenge their father's death, only for the villain to say ""No, I am your father"".",2008
9,"I am a huge fan of Mark Millar's Wanted. And so, when I entered the theater with a friend on an advance screening pass (comic book store owners are very nice people to befriend), fear gripped me. It HAS to suck...right? It's Hollywood...and a ""loose"" adaptation...",2008
1,"I watched this movie the other day, and I was actually quite excited. However, I was quickly turned from this opinion within the first 30 minutes of the movie. It got progressively worse until the ending, starting with the mass-murder/suicide and then the replay - revenge hit at the end of the movie. This ending was simply painful. Morgan Freeman is killing his career with movies like this. I appreciate the writers ability to adapt graphic novel to the big screen, but in all honesty this has to be the worst comic book or graphic novel movie ever. Save yourself the time and do something that will at least stimulate your brain: READ THE BOOK, forget the movie",2008
1,"Mindless action films abound and can be fun. This is not a mindless action film, but its ""mind"" caters to nerdy dreams of becoming a more-than-human being. Wouldn't we all like to suddenly have $3.5 million in our bank accounts, tell off our extremely annoying boss (is there any other kind?) and get trained as an ultra-assassin? Then just shoot everybody they tell you to or have a quick case of conscience, then shoot them - cool? Not.",2008
8,"This is a very easy to watch action packed movie. It delved into your imagination and as long as you are not expecting a true to life action drama you should love it. I am not normally struck on the matrix style movies but I really liked this film. The story is not be taken too seriously, just go with the flow of the film and watch the stunts and special effects. Putting Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman in the movie had to be a good move with the box office bucks. But the ace card for this movie in my opinion is James McAvoy who plays the geeky guy who turns into a top assassin. At first I did not recognize James McAvoy from his previous roles like "" The last King of Scotland "" and ' Wimbledon "". When I did realize it was the same actor I understood what a fab actor he truly is. He portrays his character with absolute ease. His transition in his role from the start of the movie to his ending character is class. James I am a true fan !! The movie is a good watch if you are into this type of movie.",2009
8,"I know there is a lot of hate going around for this movie (though it oddly manages to maintain a decent rating despite the nay-saying...) but I would really urge people to watch this movie before letting the opinions of others affect their views on it. Sure, the movie takes some liberties with plot and, obviously, physics, but it makes for a fun action/popcorn movie. It is, after all, just a movie. After seeing this film, I would say it was one of the most fun action films of 2008. It's got plenty of violence and stylized action with a dose of sexuality and a decent plot...Wesley Gibson is a miserable account manager with a dead-end life until he is approached by the beautiful Fox, who informs him that his father was a master assassin who had been murdered days before. Gibson is recruited into an assassin's guild known as the Fraternity to hunt down and kill his father's murderer.",2008
8,"This film is great! While I'm not unaware the film has probably received some harsh criticism from a few critics, this film isn't one to miss, and that's for sure. The first reason to enjoy this film is because of Timur Bekmambetov's creative directing style. Seeing as the film is based more or less on a comic, one can enjoy its very comic moments, as I did. The characters are interesting and keep you hooked till the credits roll and trust me will not bore you. James McAvoy is perfect as Wesley and many other A-list actors manage to appear in this flick, including Angelina Jolie as the sexy Fox and Morgan Freeman as the plotting Sloan. The story is a crazy one at best, but it's good enough to sit through and it does have its moments. The ending is one that may or may not take you by surprise, but it definitely had me guessing. The comedy is well served in my opinion, one of my favorite scenes is definitely when Wesley expresses his true feelings to his ""anorexic"" boss Janice and ""best friend"" Barry. The action, as anyone watching the trailer could assume, is fantastic and pure adrenaline fueled technically impossible stunts. Quite a mouthful but one surely will not be disappointed with this aspect of the film either. Especially the train scene, INCREDIBLE!! ",2009
3,"Hollywood's apparent fascination with Russian 'Nightwatch' helmer Timur Bekmambetov should (good box office notwithstanding) be efficiently assassinated by this stupid, boring, derivative, inept and mean-spirited mess.",2008
7,"Putting it bluntly, 'WANTED' was a rather formulaic and predictable outing. A loserly, office shut-in with the help of a hot babe learns about his past and is suddenly thrust into the world of assassination, a world of flipping cars, extreme gun fights, and mind-altering stunts, thus shedding every bit of his shy, weak self. This we've all seen before.",2008
7,"Everything about Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) points to how miserable he really is. He's at a dead end job, his girlfriend is sleeping around, he takes antidepressants and his boss is a pain in the ass. He wonders how his life could be different but he's stuck in a fantastic rut with no end in sight. ",2011
8,"I just got back from an advanced screening of Wanted. I have to admit not being a fan of the Director, Tim Bekmambetov. Somewhat disappointed in his Russian Films Nightwatch and Daywatch. However, in his American directorial he delivers!! An abundance of profanities and over the top action sequences that are beyond xtreme fill the screen in a dizzying array of visual adrenaline. Holding you in a tight breathtaking grip with its interesting visual techniques, humor and acting. James McAvoy (the sweet faun from the Chronicles of Narnia) plays the loser we all know, Wesley Gibbon. The guy, who just trudges through life allowing himself to be walked upon, humiliated and has no desire to escape it, except in a bottle of anti-anxiety meds. Enter a beautiful Woman, Fox (Angelie Jolie), a mysterious wise man Sloan (Morgan Freeman) and his life instantly changes from Billing Reports to Gratuitous Violence, Mastering Weaponry Skills, and Assassination. Believe me when I say what the Matrix introduced, Wanted has mastered. The director is a skilled artist at using the camera in conveying visual emotions of Wesley like I have never seen before, wait I take that back, seen it in NightWatch. I definitely recommend this deliberately humorous, action packed, violent, profane, to-the-extreme film to be seen on the big screen - check this one out!!",2008

I'm back in America for the summer and I was going to the movies with a friend, and she has what can only be called an unhealthy obsession with Angelina Jolie, so of course this was at the top of the list of movies to see. Personally I don't understand a lot of the hype about her as an actor, but I have to admit she looks good with a gun so I decided to check out the movie.",2008
2,Very poor movie. Even if you forgive the plot which is like something written by a person whose brain was seriously damaged in a bad accident.. Thats exactly what this movie is. A bad accident.

I knew I was going to a violent action film, I knew its story was about assassins, and I am neither religious nor squeamish about screen violence when it serves a good story - but I did not agree to have my face rubbed in corpses of little old ladies impaled on meat hooks and used as firing range targets; in geysers of blood, bone, brains and random gore spurting in extreme close-up and slo-mo from the craniums of Morgan Freeman, Angelina Jolie and 48 for 50 minor others, then repeated in reverse.

9,"I have long felt that the first Hellboy installment is one of the most underrated films of the 2000's. The first thing you notice about both the first film and this more than worthy successor is the passion. Everything is simply beautiful (not in the typical beautiful sense, but in that you appreciate the art that it is), and it should come as no surprise as the film's director, Guillermo Del Toro, is a long time fan of the comic stories on which the movie is based. Del Toro turned down multiple high profile projects, including multiple Harry Potter films, so he could work on the Hellboy series, which we all know will not gross as much money. Del Toro's passion for excellence is evident in this wonderful sequel, which is better than the first, and cements Del Toro's place as one of the top filmmakers of today.",2008
10,"I just got back from a preview screening of ""Hellboy II And The Golden Army"" and of all the films I've seen so far this summer Hellboy is the ONLY one to exceed my expectations. I love the second films of a super hero franchise (Superman II, Spiderman II, The Incredible Hulk) because the heroes have been introduced and the origins are out of the way so the story can begin from the start unfettered. This film is not just about Action, Action, Action but about character development and their interaction. I liked ""Pan's Labrynth"" but felt a little bit let down when the creature's personalities were not explored enough. This film takes the time to establish who Abe Sapien is beyond being defined as a fish man. Johann Krauss is a great uptight Teutonic addition to the old team with a few tricks up his sleeve and Hellboy & Liz's professional and personal relationship get more play in this film. The detail in the troll market is amazing and the story rings true to the Mike Mignola comics without having to lift a story arc from any one specific past issue. Bravo! Guillermo del Toro! I can't wait for Hellboy III.",2008
7,"Del Torro's imagination is a beautiful thing. He has created some of the most fascinating creatures that traditional Hollywood doesn't have the guts or inclination to ever assemble. I would take Guillmero Del Torro in the director's chair any time any place, but Hellboy II shows that he is not without his flaws. Ron Perlman who is terrific as Hellboy doesn't have anything truly interesting to say or do, the world around him is magical but the plot isn't.",2008

8,"When I saw the trailer for Hellboy II: The Golden Army, I hadn't seen the first Hellboy, so before I saw the sequel, I wanted to see the first movie, so I rented it and when I watched it, I wasn't really thrilled with it. I mean, it was a decent movie, but it wasn't something I would watch again, so I was thinking that the sequel was going to be a bust and probably not do much for the story, for what they had at least. Another thing was that the people that I talked to who had seen this movie before I saw it said that it was horrible and a waste of time, but I still did want to see this movie, so I decided to go ahead and just judge for myself. After all, I do admire Guillermo del Toro's style, his visions are eye candy and his stories can be incredible, so Hellboy II: The Golden Army? It seriously was so awesome! It was a whole lot better and stronger than the first Hellboy.",2008
3,"When i went to see the original Hellboy i did not have very high expectations and was pleasantly surprised when it turned out to be extremely enjoyable, i was therefore looking forward to a similarly enjoyable experience when viewing this film. My expectations were most certainly not met. Aside from the visuals, which as you would expect from guillermo del toro were excellent, and Ron Pearlman's turn as hellboy, the film stank. Following the cringeworthy opening scene with young Hellboy (surely just an excuse to get John Hurt in the film) i was hoping the film would pick up with the introduction to our villain, yet the almost immediate revelation of his fatal weakness ensured that we already knew how he would ultimately be defeated. The plot was so utterly unengaging and dull that even the fantastical creatures could not reignite my interest in what was going on. On a side note, not being aware that Seth Macfarlane had voiced the character when i first viewed the film i spent half the time wondering why Krauss sounded exactly like Klaus the fish in American Dad.",2008
10,"I had the pleasure of seeing this last night at the Alamo Draft House screening with not only Guillermo del Toro but Mike Mignola and Doug Jones attending as well. I was a fan of del Toro's work before I got into Hellboy but that was several years before the first movie. This is quite honestly one of the best marriages of both source and original material I could've hoped for. I felt the movie far surpassed the original. It was smarter, funnier, and as visually stunning as anything you can expect from either del Toro or Mignola. The sheer number and variety of fully realized monsters, with the stronger emphasis being on puppetry and make-up as opposed to an over reliance on CGI, is almost astounding in this day and age. The performances were also top notch. It was a little weird to hear Doug Jones's voice actually coming out of Abe Sapien at first but I think it added to the character and Seth McFarlane as the voice of Johann Krauss was a rather inspired gamble that paid off. All in all the best thing I can say that will probably make the strongest impact on the largest number of people is that I would gladly pay to see this movie again and I would recommend it to any of my friends, regardless of how familiar they are or aren't with Hellboy. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",2008
9,"I honestly didn't expect much when I first saw this movie. I was a fan of the first film, though it wasn't anything spectacular and I figured this would be more of the same. Wow, no. This movie was SO much better than the first, in my opinion; it was easily one of my favorite movies from 2008. I'm not saying the first was bad, I just found myself bored a lot easier at times. But this film was just flat-out more entertaining. Hellboy and the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense find themselves caught up when an elven prince declares war on the human race and attempts to awaken the invincible Golden Army to aid him.",2008
1,"First off, I absolutely adored the first Hellboy. It had great action, comedy and great graphics. Now it's true, everything we came to know and love from the first movie are in fact there; however, they are overdone to the point of exhaustion. This movie was a disgrace to the name of Hellboy. The comedy was overdone and hardly funny, the only good scene was when Hellboy and Abe were drunk and that was the only thing they didn't do as much with as they could have done. The villain looked great and had lots of great fighting moves, but he was weak. He was hardly bad at all. His makeup and skills were the only thing that posed any threat of a villain. While the relationship between Hellboy and Liz has grown, it does nothing but bore the viewer. It was as if everything was slow. The fights were prolonged unnecessarily.",2008
4,"This film is so disappointing, it felt that i was watching a crude lord of the rings in the beginning and then it started to turn into a crap Men in Black. The elf prince is not that menacing as the lead villain, i would be more scared of a cabbage patch doll!!! There was a lot of good effects and the creature make-up and designs were top notch but unless you have a good gripping story then i am afraid it counts for nothing. ",2008
5,"OK, I've read some of the reviews and commentary on this movie, and I just don't get it. I did not enjoy this movie as much as the first one. Something was just missing. Hellboy 1 had more soul. #2 was just a bunch of action scenes tied together and with a thin veneer of ""personal chemistry"" thrown in to make the viewer feel drawn in emotionally. But it didn't work on me. I really, really wanted it to, and I waited breathlessly for this release. The trailers were great, but the movie did not deliver.",2008
3,"This is my first comment on IMDb and I'm sad it has to be a harsh criticism of this movie. I wanted this movie to be good so much, and I can only say that from the opening sequence with young hell boy that I was shocked and the poor directing and slapstick that was used throughout the entire movie. I felt like I was watching men in black for most of the movie, the cheesy way that we are introduced to characters, the outrageous overacting and the severe lack of funny of the jokes. Did anyone laugh when hell boy is beat up by the mist guy with lockers? did you not feel uncomfortable and like you went to the wrong movie with the stupid love stories involved? For instance Abe falls the princess in .01 seconds and we are expected to just let it slide because the have a psychic connection. When Liz is pregnant and she has to tell hell boy to bring him back to life I decided I would never see this movie again. I waited that long in to get to that point, because I just wanted it to be good so much. outside of the plot holes and cliché beyond cliché twists the characters are just unlikeable in this one and the music score is an abomination, compared to the score of the first. I felt embarrassed taking my friends to see this and felt like I should apologize to them after it.",2008
3,"This movie was horrible, I knew straight away after seeing commercials that it wasn't going to be good. It was corny.

2,"This movie is a prime example of why I don't often see movies in the theater anymore. If I were at home I could have just turned it off, but if I've spent both time and money getting to the theater, I feel compelled to at least sit thru the movie in hopes that it'll get better. This one didn't.",2008
5,"I've seen bad movies and Hellboy II is not one of them, but it's close. If you are of the ""there's no way in hell they can do that mentality"" and wish to stab yourself in the head with a screwdriver whenever a movie pushes that envelope too far, then stay far far away. The movie is disjointed and lacks continuity from the original. The action scenes aren't bad, but there's a major lack of development on the part of the villain, Prince Nuada and his race of people that are slowly on the verge of extinction. What caused the war between his race and man? Also the ""golden army"" that is so prominently featured in the title makes only an appearance in the last scene. Touted as indestructible, Hellboy has very little problem dispatching them. I believe some more effort could have went into the final half-hour of the movie but the same could be said about the whole movie. The biggest problem I had with the movie is, why did Abe make a big deal about his breathing apparatus in the beginning, yet throughout the rest of the movie he doesn't wear one and is perfectly fine? Also, the twist at the end of the movie was super predictable. Visually, the movie was beautiful, but pretty scenery can only account for a small overall piece of a film's quality.",2008
1,"the movie is awful....basically a waste of money n time. direction is really bad n all the jokes are unnecessary as well as senseless. previous one was way better,this one could not even be called an action movie....fact is that this one was a total disaster.film had absolutely bad timing for mostly all of its scenes.For instance Abe falls the princess in .01 seconds and we are expected to just let it slide because the have a psychic connection. When Liz is pregnant and she has to tell hell boy to bring him back to life I decided I would never see this movie again. I waited that long in to get to that point, because I just wanted it to be good so much. outside of the plot holes and cliché beyond cliché twists the characters are just unlikeable in this one and the music score is an abomination, compared to the score of the first. ",2008
5,"I just want to start off saying that I thought the first Hellboy film was an amazing accomplishment, complete with a sturdy story, stunning visual effects and acting that didn't go overboard like most comic books films.

10,"I'm starting to wonder if there is bad Disney/Pixar film, I mean, normally when we think of the combo, it does equal gold, we automatically know that everyone is going to love this movie, it's just a matter of comparison to the other animation films. I'm not just saying this because I had a good time when I was watching this, I'm very serious, this is my favorite Disney/Pixar film. It's completely worth the ticket price, this couldn't have been a more perfect film. Everything about WALL·E is just beyond great: the characters, the story, and the incredible animation. But the thing that I loved about WALL·E is it's message, I know that it does go a little over board with the ""jog or get fat"", ""throw your garbage away"", and the ""we've become too dependent on machines"" message, but I felt this was the most charming way to present it to the children who have to grow up in a world where they're going to have to worry about global warming, this may open their eyes a little.",2008

Everyone's sworn to secrecy, but for a film with little dialog, it carries more of an emotional punch and has a richer story than any live-action movie this year. The tone and style of the film is completely different for Pixar, and Disney haven't tried to override the darker thematic elements at all, making the story surprisingly three-dimensional.",2008
10,"Wall-E is the movie experience I've been looking for. I haven't seen a new film this richly entertaining, thrilling, touching and satisfying since Spider-Man 2. It is truly the finest Pixar or animated CGI film to date. I can discuss it without spoilers easily because it's one of those films, like 2001: A Space Odyssey, that exists more as a pure experience of the heart and the senses than as a collection of events that we're supposed to keep track of intellectually. Wall-E rises above that kind of unnecessary complication into the same kind of space occupied by dreams and the imagination.",2008

The tradition continues in an impressive way with Wall-E. This deceptively simple tale is transformed by the emotional content told almost entirely through visuals. ",2008
8,"Just got back from a special sneak peek/advance screening of this movie, and I must say, Pixar continues to amaze. They just can't seem to make a bad move. Heck, they can't even make a mediocre movie. Now, I will admit, there have been a couple that I would classify as my ""least favorite"" of theirs, but even they were actually very, very good. This one, though...it just may take the cake. Ranks up there with the absolute best they have produced. Hysterical, emotional, meaningful -- this movie succeeds on every front! I am not going to get into spoilers or specific plot aspects, but I will say that I am almost definitely going to see this one again in the theater..and it will be worth every dime. Come Friday, be in line to see Wall-E. You don't want to miss it!",2008

I have tried all the famous movies in this genre, like Star Wars, The Matrix and A Space Odyssey and hated all of them. Next to me in the theater were a couple of Sci-fi-lovers and they loved Wall-E beyond belief. I did too, however. Wall-E is: A) A great story B) Packed with fun and humor C) Built up with memorable characters D) Fun for all ages E) Revolutionary in animation techniques ",2008
10,"Not only it's Pixar's best film of all-time but it's the best movie of this year and one of the greatest imaginative, visually, moving & excellent animated films in years and surprisingly, one of the best sci-fi movies since E.T.!! Coming with high expectations, it definitely succeeded mines. It's so beautiful, moving, hilarious & sad at the same time. And for those who has been anticipating Thomas Newman's score for WALL-E, it's certainly one of his best right behind Finding Nemo in which I thought was his best score to date! Like I said it's Pixar best film so far, WALL-E knocked off Ratatouille of the top spot in which I thought it was their best film to date and officially, WALL-E is the best Pixar film i've ever seen with Ratatouille right behind and Finding Nemo, third. Pixar fan or non-Pixar fan, you'll definitely enjoy this one. WALL-E will forever be remembered as one of the most lovable characters ever created on film!!!",2008
9,"When it comes to animated films, Pixar are masters of the craft. Ever since their feature film debut, the magnificent 'Toy Story', the animation studio have brought us such instant classics as 'Monsters Inc.', 'The Incredibles' and 'Finding Nemo', a film which remains as one of the biggest selling DVDs of all time. Surely it's about time that they delivered us a bad film? Well, sorry to disappoint, but Pixar's 'WALL-E' is among not only their greatest work, but among the greatest animations ever produced.",2008
8,"Robots falling in love. There is a lot to like about the new Pixar film Wall-E. The animation goes without sayingbetter than anything out there. The glares, the environments, everything is rendered spectacularly, right down to the flame of a Zippo lighter. As for the story, leave it to these wizards for creating a tale that hits on a gut level, letting our simplest emotions come to the surface in order speak to our hearts and souls. With fewer words than Arnold Swartzenegger had to speak in Terminator 2, this movie relies on its visuals and on the movements and actions of the characters. It is appropriate that we are shown clips from older musicals to show humanity before Earth was abandoned. If we harken back to them for the joys of people, why not go to silent era style in order to portray communication between beings that cannot speak? Wall-E, his crush EVE, and all the other robots involved can say little than their name, however, we understand exactly what they mean throughout. The entire film speaks on a level that most people might have forgotten. In an age of Hollywood spoon-feeding the masses by having actors preach the obvious, Pixar has shown their originality again by getting an audience to partake in a film that makes them pay attention and work a little; something that the message of the piece is trying to have come across for humanity in general.",2008
10,"We live in a consumerist era. As any visit to a metropolitan area will prove, there is the unfaltering marriage of burgeoning commerce to a burgeoning population. Retail giants now provide services that would take more than a handful of independent stores to supply and this umbrella is continually widening. But how far can this consumerism go before it consumes us? This is where Wall-E begins, setting up the most scathing, yet perhaps most accurate futurist take on consumerism's affect on society in any animated film I've seen to date. In fact, I can't recall any film in the last several years that has taken this approach so seriously. Andrew Stanton once again throws us straight into a darkly themed film, but once again there are serious points to be had. At the outset of the film, we are introduced to a world where the skyscrapers that once housed the internal workings of business are dwarfed and surrounded by skyscrapers built of that very business' refuse. WALL-E spends his days continuously collecting and compacting the mountains of garbage that fill the streets of the city and adding it the trash skyscrapers, piece by piece. We learn very early on that this is the last functional bot of its kind, and perhaps, the only living machine on the planet. But there is something special about this surviving Wall-E; this robot performs its programmed tasks, but it has also become a curious being, collecting and organizing interesting items seen day by day. Wall-E is, essentially, the last bit of humanity left on Earth, since every other human being is either dead or living aboard the space cruise liner, the Axiom.",2008
10,"I thought that Pixar was one of the greater animation studios of the new millennium; after seeing Wall-E, I'm convinced that Pixar is the greatest modern animation studio, and perhaps one of the most talented and treasured film companies period. Writer-Director Andrew Stanton has not only managed to create a technical marvel with Wall-E, pushing the boundaries of computer animation technology to the limits, but also a work of pure art that's more intelligent, heartfelt, thought provoking, and flat-out masterful than any movie in years.",2008
10,"Wall-E is the film Pixar has been working toward ever since Toy Story first tested the boundaries of computer animation. It is without a doubt the best Pixar film, if not the best computer animated feature ever made, and it ranks with the rest of Disney's classics.",2008

The powerful corporation Buy N Large builds a huge spacecraft called Axiom and sends the entire civilization for a five-year cruise while trash collector robots called WALL-E (Waste Allocator Load Lifter  Earth) would clean the planet. However, the equipment fail and seven-hundred year later, only a single robot WALL-E is performing his duty. His only companion is a cockroach and his great entertainment is watching an old ""Hello Dolly"" videotape. When a spaceship lands on Earth out of the blue and leaves the probe Eve, WALL-E follows her and falls in love for Eve. After a hostile initial contact, the dangerous Eve gets close to WALL-E and he gives a small plant to her. Eve gets the plant and automatically sends a signal to the spaceship that returns and takes Eve back. However, the desperate WALL-E grabs on the hull and travels through the space chasing Eve until they reach Axiom and find a full automated facility crowded by lazy and fat human beings unable even of walking with their legs. The expectation of life on Earth brings hope to the Captain against the will and prime direction of the auto-pilot that organizes a mutiny on board.",2008

1,"As a teenager--15 years old, in fact, the same as the main character--I have to say this is an awful, unrealistic, cardboard-cutout teenage drama program. While I understand the thinly veiled message of abstinence, it is not brought forth in a intelligent or believable manner. If we're old enough to have sex, I think we're old not to be pandered and talked down to, which seems to be the primary aim of the show. Amy, the main character, is a shallow, boring, sour character. The show's attempts to make her seem remotely geeky or normal at all tend to fall flat, and in general the plot and character development of all of the characters is very poor indeed. The script comes off cheesy and overdone, the acting is terrible, and it's really just a show of stereotypes, not interesting, complex people. Not real people. The dramatic story lines are not half as entertaining as they would be with real people, in real situations, with realistic reactions.",2009

Even the most genuine characters are phony. There are plot holes all over the place, and most things are never explained. Remember Rumer Willis? Who, what, where, when, wtf? Amy's dynamic with everyone just sucks, especially with Ben. According to them, they were in love after like two minutes. (A side note, the world love is tossed around excessively on this show, along with sex, funeral, baby, etc.) If they are so madly in love, why do they seem to hate each other? Another thing that bugs me is how nonchalant the parents are about their young children having ""serious' relationships. Just because you are a high schooler does not mean the only thing you think about is sex/omg I need a boyfriend! The whole show is going nowhere, but it has found its place in my TV schedule as comic relief. I'm in too deep now, but if I were you, I would avoid Secret Life at all costs.",2009

Brenda Hampton has no sense of what a teenager really acts like, all she seems to go on is stereotypes from other shows/movies. Grace is the overachiever who wants to go to med school: of course she's pretty and blonde. Adrian is Hispanic/Latina, of course she's the school hussy, and of course she has a mother who is never around. Jack is on the football team, so of course he'd be dating Grace. Amy is such a waste of a character. No teen is that naive, unless they have some sort of metal disability, and no: I am not dogging on the mentally disabled. Ricky is actually the only character that I could possibly see as a real teen. Ashley's personality doesn't fit the girl playing her, at all. Is she monotone, or is that her voice for the character?

1,"This has to be the most degrading show on television. Not in a physical sense but in a mental sense. The female characters are beyond naive and ignorant and the male characters are down right jerks. As a female who not that long ago was a teen, I felt like I was hurting the human race by giving this ratings. What a way to put down American teens. This is NOT the secret life of the American teenager. What a way to generalize. The main character Amy is made out to be some innocent damsel in distress who gets pregnant her very first time with a guy. While yes you can get pregnant your first time. Most teens who have kids have had sex more then once. Most of them, though made stupid decisions also weren't as naive as Amy. It's insulting. Teens know how to get pregnant and they certainly know how NOT to get pregnant. It is a choice they're making. This show makes Amy out to be so innocent she didn't know she was having sex. What??? I can hear teens now using that excuse after seeing this. Why are guys always the jerks. They make it seem like all of the problems on the show are the fault of the male characters. The female characters eat up everything the male characters feed to them as if they are so easily coaxed and have no minds of their own. They make the male characters to be out only for themselves with nothing else on their minds but to coax these ""innocent"" females who don't know any better. Please, females aren't stupid. In this day and age, we're strong, intelligent beings. Men aren't the enemy and they aren't all out for themselves. Save your dignity and self respect by NOT watching this trash.",2009
2,"Wow. This show was pretty bad. I was hoping the show would dig deep and find true secrets and struggles teens go through, but it was just so bland, predictable, and unrealistic! First of all, that is not how teens talk! It felt very scripted the whole time and didn't reflect how teenagers truly interact. In the 1st episode when Amy's friends find out she is pregnant, the pauses in their conversation and reactions are not how people would react. once they find out, they kind of carry on as if the news wasn't a HUGE shock to them.",2008

Every line in this show is about sex. And that is completely inaccurate.",2009
2,"Those who like it seem as if they've never truly experienced high school, or are too far out of it (high school). No teenagers I've met talk about sex that much, nor are they this stupid. I am sure that teenagers do not think about marriage, and their immediate reaction to pregnancy would probably be abortion. The only seemingly reasonable adult is Amy's mom, but then again, I haven't seen all of the episodes. But overall, my least favorite character is the school counselor. He's too unrealistic and stupid. No school would give a student a schedule change in order to chase after a girl, and he never discourages sex, he just goes along and pretends to be friends with the students. He doesn't really seem like an authority figure. All the characters either lack personality or extreme stereotypes, and badly acted ones at that.

In the second episode, when the counsellor tells Ben that whatever a woman does before she meets you is none of your business i was actually positively surprised. But then he follows with saying that thankfully she probably feels ashamed and guilty (about having done ""anything"" with Ricky)-making it okay. So let's make teens feel guilty about sex! How ridiculous is that? Also, i hate the fact that the two sexually active people (Ricky and Adrien) are portrayed as ""broken"" sociopathic individuals. This is not a healthy example for young people, i think it is much more relevant to make sexuality a matter open for discussion, about enjoyment, love, and safety. Not something to be ashamed about.",2008

""Secret Life"" is not one of these shows. 15 year olds having casual sex in pretty much every episode, and portraying it as just something to do to pass the time. Amy, the central character, has got to be the absolute most stupid, naive, ""good girl"" who gets pregnant on the first time, with Ricky, the schools 15 year old sex addict. It is appalling.",2009

I guess this is a really good young chick show, packed full of father hating nuance, pregnant teen-queens and arrogant know-it-all youths.

Not my cup of tea and I do not feel there are any impassioned queries that warrant my attention or a reply. I truly enjoyed the commercial breaks and think they did a wonderful job of breaking up the monotony of the show. Ah well...if I were a young girl I probably would be all giddy and my heart would be a fluttering over this show",2009
7,"I absolutely think this show is a wretched depiction of a pregnant teenager's life. At 15 you should know if you had sex or not, even if it was bad an short lived. It's kinda obvious what it is. Once you're pregnant, it is very rare that you are going to start dating some other guy, and fall in love within dates (that doesn't happen to non-pregnant teens). This guy is not going to propose to you, and if he does, his father definitely won't approve. The chances that your father's x-wife's husband is your pediatrician are impossible because your parents wouldn't be imbeciles. You probably wouldn't be the same age as your dad's x-wife's daughter, considering the time it takes to divorce, move on, and move on again (that's what Grace's mom did because she cheated on Amy's dad with someone who wasn't her current husband). Cliques in high school are not named, it is completely generic (Majorette is a cliché-ed term and a ten year old could think of it) The fifteen year old's sister who is supposedly 13 would not look older than the elder. Your dad's x-wife's daughter's love interest would not be your baby daddy. You would speak using contractions (ie. can't instead of cannot). You probably wouldn't be oblivious to the fact that your parents are having a rough patch. You won't be stupid enough to think that fake id's (with a different name on them) will legally be enough for you to get married. You're friends would probably act like they are five (Madison and that other girl are so immature) but their IQ's would be higher than that of a five year old (they take the longest pauses before they say their lines).",2009
1,"Wow, let me begin with a excerpt of basic dialog in this show: ""Hey Amy whatcha doin?"" ""Amy: Havin sex, what are you doing?,"" ""BEN:Oh, I just got done having sex"", AMY: ""Do you want to come over and have sex?"" BEN: ""Yes, I just got talking to my dad about sex"", AMY: ""Oh thats great, we can have sex while the baby is sleeping."" BEN: ""Jimmy said he had intercourse the other day."" AMY: ""Whats intercourse?"" BEN: ""I think its kinda like sex."" Anyways, the acting is horrible, the plot is horrible and unrealistic, the dialogue is terrible, and the characters are so uninteresting. The most entertaining part about this show is counting how many times they say sex in one episode--oh and that main character chick is smoking hot. I don't watch this show, but my girl friend does and I have lost respect for her. The trash that the networks put on the air is ridiculous.",2010
2,"As I said it's downright awful. The acting is awful and the story is so unbelievable. Ben says he loves Amy in the second episode! And then he wants to marry her by the fifth? They are 15! The acting is just appalling. I'm sure there are so many other talented young actresses out there who can show a little bit more emotion than just staring intently with a sour face. The girl who plays Ashley has one look, blank, and when she changes her mood all that happens is her voice gets louder. Amy another lifeless character, all see does it fiddle with her hair and then start crying and go on about how she can't have the baby.",2009

On top of this, a young couple are living together in a small apartment. They discuss having previously conceived a child, but I didn't catch on to what happened otherwise. In one scene in the episode, the guy is cleaning in the living room and finds a box of condoms underneath a sofa cushion. When he confronts his girlfriend (Amy?), she tells him, ""I think I'm pregnant again.""

This movie just looked incredible, even though it's a touchy subject with the holocaust, it still looked like it was going to be a great story. Everyone always makes a comment about the innocence of childhood, what it was like to just not have reason, to just go with the flow of things before adults tell you what you have to do. So I watched The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas today and this movie seriously is one of the saddest films I have ever seen, but I felt it was very maturely handled.

10,"I was sitting at the very back row of Cineworld, Dublin screen nine and struggling with my tears. I thought it would be extremely embarrassing if people see tears in my eyes. But I was so wrong! The lady sitting beside me was crying like anything. Finally we ended up with the move and it started showing casts on its black screen. But, not a single person moved from his seat or probably lost their (including myself) power to move. The only sound I heard was the sound of people's emotion. Guy sitting one row before me hugged his girlfriend who were crying like a little kid. The guy himself was also in tear. I saw a girl from Cineworld cleaning staff with horrifying red eyes. Everyone was spellbound there! ",2008

5,"All right: the movie is a fable, not a realistic representation of real events. So I can forgive some of the many, many unrealistic events and situations in the story. Judging by other reviews here, the movie clearly works powerfully on many people. The young actor who plays the lead role does an excellent job.",2008
1,"This movie is proof that we have reached the point of diminishing returns on films about the Holocaust. Many reviewers here have already recounted the ridiculous storyline, the bad acting, etc., so I'll skip over that aspect of this cinematic failure. What struck me more than anything is how implausible the plot was and how unforgivably manipulative the ending is. My only emotions as the credits rolled on this dud were of disbelief that anyone would make such an irresponsible movie about such a serious subject matter. And so it brings me to the conclusion that we may just have said all there is to say about the Holocaust. When movies like this begin to appear, it's subject, the Holocaust, has become a tool. A tool for money making, emotional exploitation, or commercialization. It is a disservice to history, and to the murdered millions, to use the Holocaust in such a shallow capricious manner. Don't see this film.",2010

8,"It's official. The award now goes to the British for making the most depressing film I have ever seen. For the first time in my movie-going life I witnessed an audience member's physical reaction to a film when a father was observed outside the screening room for ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" collapsed against the wall with his child emotionally distraught and crying in his lap. With the rest of the audience, including myself, stunned into silence after the film and exiting the theater a communal internalized wreck, I don't know if I was more devastated by what I had witnessed on screen or by that poor little child out in the hallway whose father for some reason thought this film would provide a history lesson his child could stomach at such a young age. As the film proves, the innocent are not cut out for war.",2008
1,"I love factual war-time movies - the Pianist for example Is a work of genius - but oh dear, this TV movie Is a weepy for the girls (perhaps?) at very best! Everything looks fake, from the uniforms(which look like fancy dress)to the 'extermination camp' which Is totally inaccurate. As for the storyline - come on,have you ever seen anything so ludicrous and unbelievable? It does'n't take a Historian to know that concentration camps were guarded at all points 24-hours a day and that no-one was allowed within several meters of the fence - on BOTH sides! Furthermore,the camp on the film - an 'extermination' camp as opposed to a 'normal' concentration camp - would have been especially heavily guarded, as the Nazis wanted the systematic killing of Jews to be kept from the public. ALL such camps had a Double-layered fence with a three-meter 'no-mans land' In- between, a far cry from the single,flimsy fence through which,It seems,inmates can pop In-and-out of at will(but apparently choose not to do so!). We are left to believe,then,that In THIS camp, people break In but DON'T break out!! And a little boy at that,who goes In and out seemingly at will!(The naivety of the two boys borders on idiocy,to boot!) I mean,come on - the makers weren't being serious,were they? Add to this debacle the simple fact that In reality all external fences In the camps were ELECTRIFIED and what we have here Is a load of historically inaccurate twaddle - and that's putting It very mildly - with a storyline which would be comical were It not for the serious nature of the subject. Such sensitive matters should be dealt with In a sensitive way - not made Into some kind of ridiculous parody as this has been. An absolute Insult to those who suffered In the camps, I consider this film to be one of the stupidest of all time. Well done to the actors,though,for managing to play It straight faced! Utter Rubbish.",2012

9,"This contains mild spoilers about the ending. I had read the comments on this page before i left for the cinema and so was hoping for good things and i was not disappointed. I had already read the book and so knew what to expect and told my sister and my cousin they were going to cry at the end. They both did, i have never seen my sister cry so much at a film. Even the British accents that everyone is going on about didn't put me off, i loved Bruno and thought the Mum was excellent. I had read that people had been sitting silently in cinemas after the film was over and i really didn't believe that people would, but we all did. Everyone in the cinema was silent and stayed at least until the entire cast had gone up. I would recommend this film (and the book), but i do think the 12A certificate it got here, in the UK, was too low. The end was traumatic and it should have been a 15. (My sister thinks it should have been a 21 so she couldn't see it. She's still rather upset)",2008
5,"""The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas"" is a romanticized version of a time in history that had nothing romantic about it. The title itself is an indication that this movie is going to depict the horrors of World War II through the innocent eyes of a little boy, an approach that I already despised in the similarly out of place ""Life Is Beautiful"". Personally, I don't believe in the natural goodness of children or in their naive innocence when it comes to befriending others, but that's not even the main problem I have with this movie.",2009

I do not know the mechanics of the film business and distribution, but I had been hearing ""buzz"" and radio advertisements about this film for the last 30 days, and it wasn't until recently that it opened in only 2 theaters (25 miles apart) in all of metropolitan Sacramento.",2008
10,"I am still in absolute shock from this film. No movie I have ever seen comes close to this. I was still shaking from the end when I got back home and it still gives me chills just thinking about it. If there is one movie that you NEED to see this year, make it this one. You will not regret seeing this one bit. There wasn't that much visible violence; it was inferred and this effect makes it even more horrific. All of the characters are played wonderfully and everything is very realistic and believable. If you have seen Schindler's List, and Sophie's Choice, you should defiantly see this movie. This really is, in my opinion, the best movie of 2008 so far.",2008
8,"I was completely astonished the first time I saw the movie, Definitely, Maybe. It truly was, as my summary suggests, absolutely wonderful, and that has mostly to do with the performances by the casts' dedication, though the plot and execution of the entire film was remarkable, as well, and the whole atmosphere and the way the movie folds out is incredible.",2008

9,"This turned out to be a surprisingly good little romance with touches of humor. I must admit that I wasn't expecting much when I sat down to watch this film, but it turned out to be a total viewing pleasure for me. One of the reasons for my low expectations is that I had just watched Chaos Theory in which Ryan Reynolds plays the role of a family man whose life is turned upside down. In fact both films start the same why in which an older, wiser Ryan tells the story in a series of flashbacks. From there on, they couldn't be farther apart. Whereas Chaos Theory is a mess of hysteric scenes and overacting, Definitely, Maybe is a believable tale with a big, big heart.",2008
9,"I just saw this movie today and I loved it. I was the only teenage guy in the theatre also. The movie had a great message to it about always being happy. The little girl in this movie was also great she brought a lot to this movie, with out her this would not have been a good movie. The acting was good and the direction was especially good as well. I saw this with my dad today and it brought tears to his eyes. So this movie was also a tear jerker. For someone that loves romantic comedy movies I think would love this movie. It was a little slow moving but I kind of expected it to be. After it got near the end of the movie though it really got you thinking and wishing for him to end up with the girl he was meant to be with. It kind of also took little twists which were good as well. Ryan Reynolds did a terrific job in this movie playing a father who is going through a divorce. Then his daughter tries to help him find his true love. This movie was everything I hoped for so I think that you should definitely take someone to see this movie and have a great time.",2008

It's a lower art form subscribed to by the uneducated masses, the same plot regurgitated through a word processor with names, dates and locations changed: (""Girl meets boy, she's feisty, he's snobbish, they don't see eye to eye - How oh how are they ever going to end up together by the end of the movie?""). Admittedly, I'm not the biggest advocate of the ol' romcom, but this film falls into the ""watchable"" category of romantic comedy. Of course it's phoney and sugar-coated. Of course it has no resemblance to real life - ",2008

9,"As usual with romantic comedies, don't believe much of the negative critique you read about this movie. The move is very entertaining, very romantic, and will play on your nostalgic side if you have one. If you're a 20 something that has been in and out of some significant relationships, this will hit close to home, in a positive way. I wouldn't suggest this movie for a first date because it's not quite light-hearted and happy enough. Watch this one on a second or third date OR watch it with someone you've known for a while who you are about to reveal your feelings to. I promise you - it'll set you up nicely...",2008

But I got to see it for free, if the price is right, why not? So I watched it and actually I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. Ryan Renolds, I love the guy in comedies, I haven't seen him in drama, so I was a little skeptical, but after seeing Definitely, Maybe, he pulled in a good performance that surprised me. The only thing I have to say I was a little disappointed in was Abigail Breslin, her performance in Little Miss Sunshine was wonderful and heart warming, Definitely, Maybe didn't bring in her best performance, who knows? It could've been the script or director, but she pulls a decent enough performance to where the movie works and puts a different twist on the average romantic comedy.",2008
10,"It was without the least expectation that i saw this movie's trailer and i was like ""wow!! should be a good entertainer,must have good laugh-out moments and so on"" and this was the reason why decided to see this film. I love drama movies to the core personally and i happened to see this movie without expecting much,just a few light-hearted moments and i thought it would be over.But i was so wrong, this movie had more than romance and comedy to it. It had a soul to carry over and the portrayal of Ryan Reynolds as Will Hayes is mind blowing. ",2011
9,Can I just say how nice to see Ryan Reynolds in a movie where he's not a total schmuck? I love the premise of this movie and trying to explain to his daughter (Breslin) just how complicated and fragile we can make relationships. She insists from the start that it's not that difficult. You love each others - you should be together. End of story. But he does such a beautiful job explaining to her the choices and changes in his life that led him to the point he was at (divorcing her mother) that it was really sweet and heartwarming.,2012
7,"If you were looking for an evening in (or out) watching a romcom (and don't we all feel that that sometimes), choose this one above some of the more well known and popular examples. It's well-crafted and tries hard to avoid many of the well-known clichés. Plenty of twist and turns: sentimentality, yes, but not laid on with a table-knife rather than a trowel. Admittedly not quite Harry met Sally or Annie Hall, as, though competently acted, the characters are still romcom cyphers. But marvel at the script-writers' solid achievement of entertainment and engagement. Competent production values keep it rolling along to the last second, without padding. If it had just added those witty little touches of human observation that characterise a great movie it might have made it into my ""8"" rating, reserved for films that have something outstanding.",2011
10,"Quality romantic comedies are becoming quite sparse. Call it a cultural shift. Blame the influence of reality TV.

10,"First, allow me to say that the screen father/daughter chemistry of Abigail Breslin and Ryan Reynolds is wonderful. The two deliver Oscar worthy performances in hands-down the best romantic comedy I've seen.",2008
6,"Decent but contrived comedy that has its heart in the right place but depends more on old plot twists than telling a compelling story. The mystery of who's the mom of Abigail Breslin's character is really easy if you're in tune to the laws of romantic comedies and the story of how it happens just does not jell very well at all. It's more a romantic who dun it than a romantic comedy and you get bored after a while with it, especially when you can see the ending already before the actual film ends. But the film has its heart in the right place and it's not hard to like it, especially if you have a few very good performances that are giving the film more than it deserves. Ryan Reynolds does a great job as the hero of the piece and he has great chemistry with Rachel Weisz, who is just flat out fun, sexy and charismatic. Kevin Klein is fun as well as the other man in Weisz's characters life. Too bad for Reynolds though that both Weisz and Klein are not in the film that much because they are the best things about this movie and while they are not on screen, Reynolds basically has to fiend for himself in dealing with less interesting characters and predicament and that's where the film begins to lose its charm. Isla Fisher is adorable and sweet but there is nothing much to her character that we have not seen before and Elisabeth Banks is fine with a character that she manages to give some life to despite the fact of how one dimensional she is.",2008

1,"For starters, sorry for my English but I am not a native – but suffering by watching this movie made me to write a review. I have never seen such a boring film/story in my entire live. Don't want to blame the producers/director of the film – they made their money I assume, but it was really awful, even the attempts to slapstick were horrible. All characters are empty jars, it is all quite predictable. Well, thats not unusual in a romantic comedy, but here it is just way too much. In the beginning there is shown the genitals of the main character 3 times - or maybe a dummy of them, and you are asking yourself: why the h... is that necessary? Is that supposed to be funny? The story dabbles on and on, he is left by her, he is a real lame duck, anyhow he manages to get a lot of quite beautiful women in his bed trying to forget his ex with sex - what never works out and what in the meantime is common knowledge to every hillbilly. Nothing will help, so he is going on vacation at a resort in Hawaii - and nice coincidence - accidentally his ex-girlfriend is in the same resort with her really dummy of a rock star-boyfriend and on and on ... horrible.

There was the usual crude and creative humor as well inappropriate sexuality to make another great Apatow team production. People should not come in with the expectation that this is another romantic comedy reincarnation of ""Knocked Up"". This is more of a typical and organic romantic comedy. The heavy emotional weight and issues in ""Knocked up"" are not present in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"". The casting and comedic pacing was done very well and though it may not be a cinematic heavy hitter, it was very good for a directing debut and it was what movies all strive to be, entertaining.",2008

8,"I'm going to be honest, walking into the advanced screening tonight I was expecting an overly chick flicky somewhat dull comedy. What I got instead was a pretty hilarious movie with just the right amount of romance and a whole lot of vulgar comedy also. I can honestly say this is the funniest movie of 2008 so far. The entire Judd Apatow crew has overall had about 4 or five great comedies in the last 3 years, putting them up with all the other great comedy film makers since 2005. This movie makes me feel like I can now trust any movie they make most the time. When this movie hits theatres in April, GO SEE IT. I promise you won't find a funnier movie out any time soon.",2008

Apatow has had nothing but big success with his comedies: 40-year-old Virgin, Knocked Up, Superbad, Walk Hard, and now Forgetting Sarah Marshall, their next big hit. Also Jason Segal's first major script brought to life, I have to say he's got talent, the reason I say that? These characters... they're likable! Not only are the likable, they are real and people you could relate too! For example, Sarah Marshall's new boyfriend that she broke up with Peter for, yeah, he's a little bit of a moron, but you know what? You could understand why people liked him, he was pretty cool, even the girlfriend, Sarah, yeah, she was a jerk, but so real and also you don't get too mad at her with her reason on why she fell out of love with Peter. Forgetting Sarah Marshall has great laughs and a fun story.",2008

It tried too hard to be funny. It was a complete waste of time. I thought that it made no sense at all. The ending was sloppy and random. it seem like they tried to rush the ending just to get it over with. I had no idea why and how he even got to send a letter to the girl! The beginning was super dull and showed no relationship value between peter or Sarah Marshall. The acting was super phony. I think that the only reason why it would have good reviews is because of all the excessive sexing and apparently Mila Kunis' tits.. which is not even a real picture of her.. its photo-shopped. so think before you even bother to watch this stupid movie.",2010

This one is LITERALLY, ""The Emperors New Clothes."" Someone has no clothes= laugh riot. And I have nothing against raunchy humor, but this is just not funny. I appreciate that they tried to have characters, but where are the jokes? It plays like a meandering weak sitcom with occasional nude people and unfunny cursing substituting for laughs. And two hours long????? You've got to be kidding me. Brevity is often best with comedy, but not in the Apatow cannon. ""Knocked-Up,"" another disappointing snooze (that some critic compared""Annie Hall""-- Huh ????) is two hours and fifteen minutes!!!!!!

The film ended and the mood was ruined so we all went our separate ways, ruined the night ! OK so pros and cons. Pros beautiful setting in Hawaii, looks good on bluray. Cons worst acting ever; you can tell everyone concerned is just thinking about payday. Predictable poor plot. Zero character development. Forced jokes which fall flat.

1,"This movie appeared as its predecessors, knocked up, 40 yr old virgin, to be crude and immature but with occasional funny parts worthy of a Saturday night at home. This was not so, the movie stars an undefined characterless loser with no personality who, i guess is supposed to develop and grow into something more during the movie. Well that doesn't happen. We get to see his sagging penis flashed throughout the movie though (i suppose the writers were so frustrated with their inability to actually develop a worthwhile plot that they thought throwing in full frontal male nudity would make make up for its overall dreary stupidity, it only made it worse). The films continual crude scenes of awkward sex and the general focus on actual intercourse further added to its vitriol and made it seem like it was written by a 13 year old boy. which seems likely. The plot descended into such nothingness, i honestly stopped watching halfway through. I thought Russell brand would make the movie marginally worthwhile, but his personality doesn't even make whimper. All in all, plot= vacuous, acting= bad bad horrible, especially the vapid potato head who blessed the lead role , and don't , for the love of god watch this with your family. its so stupidly crude that you wont want to look each other in the eye after watching it. good lord, what a waste of 1 1/2 hours..",2009

The movie is worst than the trailer and after spending 2 hours watching it, I couldn't recall one single line that made me laugh. The funniest parts of the movie were the CSI parodies, but that also is pretty passé. I couldn't relate to any of the characters nor hope that they will be together, because I found them utterly stupid. The plot is extremely predictable and inconclusive.

Do yourself a favour and stay well away from this dross and check out some more worthy alternatives that would give you far greater pleasure. Check out films like the holiday or 27 dresses, these movies would offer a far more satisfying cinema experience. I sincerely hope more educated film goers vote negatively for this film, in the manner it genuinely deserves there bye giving it a more realistic rating that other film buffs could base their judgement upon. Come on folks let's be fair to everyone concerned and give those involved with this film a true reflection on what it is they have produced - an extremely mediocre picture that deserves to be forgotten very quickly.",2009

The characters are just a collection of stereotypes...and they are not even up-to-date stereotypes! Surfers that have smoked themselves into a stupor are way eighties, dudes. I think Paul Rudd, whom I like, knew his character was just another variation of Spicoli and phones it in a little. ",2008
2,"Maybe this movie would have worked with a better cast. Maybe this comedy would have worked if it has a sense of humor. As it stands, Foregetting Sarah Marshall is a totally forgettable film that will leave you wondering how it ever got made. It is kind of like several comic strips taped together to make a story.",2010
1,What a waste of time. I feel cheated out of 111 minutes of my life and i want it back. Definitely not funny and not even a good movie in any other respect. Russell Brand was mildly interesting but it wasn't enough. I can't understand how it could get a 7.3 rating on IMDb except that their must be lot of high people watching and then reviewing it. Find something else to watch and don't trust the inflated ratings on IMDb. And this minimum review length is lame. How long do you need to read that i thought this movie sucks monkey butts? How many ways does it need to be said? This movie gives Jason Segal a really bad name since he is the guy that wrote it (for now he should just stick to acting).,2014
10,"The movie is absolutely hilarious. I loved it. It met and exceeded by (very high) expectations. Jason Segall proved he can hold down a leading role and an extremely funny script. Part of the reason this movie is so funny are the ""funny 'cause it's true"" aspects of Peter's method of dealing with his breakup. Although the honeymooner's plot was a little unnecessary, everything else was great. All the characters were really funny and the dialogue and situations were hilarious. Definitely worth paying for to see in the theaters and watching it with everyone else around you busting out laughing as well is a worthy experience too.",2008
10,"I, like another member that posted, am not in the targeted age group for this type of show, but I loved it! I feel Suite Life both shows were really funny youthful shows. It was nice watching the boys grow-up on screen. Being that I love useless facts and statistics I love knowing where I have seen faces before. Amazingly enough I realized these were the little boy in Big Daddy. Wow on how old you seem when you remember seeing them as very young kids and now they are entering adulthood. I especially liked the closing; it was one that I enjoyed and felt that was relevant to the entire plot of the show. Few shows have had final episodes that were good and explained the future of the characters.(still mad at Seinfeld's ending)I will miss laughing at the characters antics. It was a wonderful show.",2011
10,"The show is amazing. The acting is really very good, the writing is great, and the look is very nice. The sets are pretty and the clothes are very cute. The story lines are captivating and the humor is impressive. The best show on Disney Channel.",2009
8,i think that in the Greek one at the end when the are dancing they should really Greek dance not just walk.... i really enjoy the show i loved suite life of Zack and cody so this is just the same! Some parts are really funny and some are sad but the show is really good and i would like them to do some thing new tho it may be a good show but its always the same in a way they change it up but every episode has something the same in it.................................. the show should stay on and family should make it even better because some are getting bored but wont stop watching because it is some thing they like..,2010
10,"This is a great add on. I really liked the show before they made on deck. And even though they took out some of the good actors they got new ones which weren't so bad. Cole and Dylan still do a great job on the show and keep there character as if its not supposed to be new. London is still kinda funny but a little more retarded in my opinion. The new actors are alright, there's bailey who's a pretty good addition kind of funny and pretty much the (hot) girl of the show, and then there's Woody who is pretty crazy and like a wild card. I was a little worried at first that they had said the show was going to be completely different. But its the same old Zack and Cody and the other actors that moved on which really made me happy. I also want to point out that I am sure a majority of kids are watching the episodes on the computer and not the T.V. so there are a lot of viewers. The Beginning theme is pretty catchy, like the suite life. Sometimes the jokes can be corny and the laughing background clip is unnecessary. But the show mostly makes me laugh. KEEP THE EPISODES COMING!!",2008
10,"Just finished watching the premier episode. The show does have a different feel that the original, but is very funny. I won't give away any spoilers for those who haven't seen it yet, but so far, the show is off to a very good start. My honest opinion is that the first episode was funnier than most episodes of original and that's saying a lot.",2008
10,This is an amazing show. People who say Disney channel is just for kids needs to sit down and watch this show and stop being so stuffy. ,2008
7,"This show is my guilty little pleasure and I don't admit this to many people since I am 28 years old. No, I am not a creeper, I just enjoy the dynamic of the show and the twin's antics remind me of the stuff I used to do when I was younger. The show is sort of a nostalgic piece for me, a modern show of a more innocent time of moral family programming. Although my girlfriend despises the show and protests fiercely when she walks in and I am watching it, I find myself apathetic to he pleas. I guess I am just immature.",2010
7,"As with all Disney shows produced ""The Suite Life on Deck"" is a great show for kids and teens. The Sprouse brothers and the whole cast does a great job as well as the casting director by looking for guest stars and co-stars. As I already mentioned in the title - it is a typical Disney show production - so it is very likely that adults won't be tho thrilled with it. If you are not an adult in the entertainment business and watch it for the purpose to keep up with Disney and Nick style you have a real boring life. It is made for kids and teens and it is good. The show also, for adults maybe not so obvious, points out problems and issues of teenagers in our society. As it is with all shows and films it might be a bit overdone ... The show is obviously a bit campy - but in a good way - kids enjoy it watching fun and this is the only way to bring these issues closer to them. By observing the content and the plots we can filter out the issues of growing up teenage boys (also in some ways of girls) and the American issue of masculinity and femininity. Further we see the problems of school and leisure time and how it is supposed to look like in our society. Of course not everything in the show is great. It is not the most expensive production which of course takes away some of the quality. Some of the cast members from The Suite Life of Zack & Cody are not in this show. In some ways that's positive in some it is negative. Ashley Tisdale is missing to play the opposite of Brenda Song. Casting did a good job to find a substitute and therefore a new cast member with Debby Ryan. Still Tisdale is missing.",2008
10,"is great, very meal, I support that we can always do better but I like it as it is, Dylan and Cole do their job well and are fun, I have to do the series over the Internet (youtube) on Disney Channel of my country not to air this, I wish that it were and continue with its production which is fabulous.",2008
9,"London is dumber! Woody is somehow smarter than London, which I originally thought was impossible! But still pretty awesome!!! The episodes where characters of the original show (The Suite Life of Zack and Cody) were the worst, well, I kinda liked when Esteban (Julio Ricardo Montoya de la Rosa Ramirez) came on the show for that one episode. More inappropriate for the little kids, as it has some sexual reference (ex. Zack ripping off the girls shirt, and when Woody asks how they have a baby and their teacher says ""that's another class"", etc). I can see a PG13 to R rated theatre movie coming where there will probably be some sex and/or nudity (like girl on girl, Bailey on London). Anyway, I'll just stop talking about sex and just say 9/9, 4/5",2010
1,"I like Dylan and Cole but honestly, the Sprouse twins can do better. The jokes are corny and terrible, London's stupidity is just plain annoying (is she mentally retarded or something?), Bailey is too sweet (made me want to throw up)... the only saving grace is Phil Lewis who plays Mr Moseby.",2008
5,"I found this show very funny , very cool and very awesome i love this show and it sucks that its ended but a least i got the movie to look forward to soon i really like this show compared to So Random! and sonny with a chance , pair of kings this is the best show by far this is the best show by far and i don't know what i will watch instead i will miss this show.",2012
7,"""The Suite Life of Zack and Cody"" is one of my favorite TV shows of all time. Yes, I said ""All time"" The characters in that TV Show are so awesome and lovable. I was expecting much the same from the spin-off series. I was satisfied, I guess...",2012
8,"While my opinion doesn't affect the show, I will say it anyway. As with almost every show geared towards teens, it could have been a lot better.",2010
9,i love both TSL. but this one gone better. new characters Bailey and Woody are really funny. cause we got the country girl and we got the slob. and the character Mr. Moseby gotten more grumpier...which is better!! the season 2 of the show gotten waaaay better cause now its in HD and the comedy gotten great and violence gotten violent and real! and also London gotten dumber and the dumber the better!! the thing that kinda bumps me is that Maddie isn't there anymore...i liked her on TSLOZAC...she was hilerious!!! but still the show is going strong!! so i put this show the 2th best show on Disney. hope the show will go for a 3th season!!!!,2010
2,"I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings but I find this show to be one of the most irritating thing ever to make it into my den. My tween daughter loves it but I can not figure out why. The writing is so horrible I wouldn't be surprised to learn a barrel is filled with phrases and punchlines then a chimp randomly selects and assembles the plot. The character of Tipton makes Lovie Howell look like Mother Theresa, just so over the top annoying I don't understand how she alone doesn't kill the ratings. The other characters are shallow and mainly seem to rely on being cute more than likable. I can't say about the actor's talents based on what they have to work with. Actually they must be good to sell this sort of poor material. Overall it is just harmless fun for middle school kids but anybody over 15 watching this stuff because they like it not because they live with a tween should seek help.",2010
10,"I actually kind of enjoy this show. Its a guilty pleasure for me. I usually am not a fan of the Disney channel shows these days, but this one is just.... happy and nice. I struggle with depression, and this show surprisingly helps. When I get depressed, I like to watch TV to get my mind off things, but I don't like watching dramatic, or sad things when I'm in a depressed mood obviously. So, I turn to this show. It has stupid characters, and cheesy comedy, but I get a few laughs out of it sometimes. I think that the Sprouse twins are hilarious, surprisingly. They are super cute, and funny to watch. I mean, twins on TV are usually funny, but I really enjoy watching these Twins. Brenda Song is good for her role, London Tipton. She portrays her character as Stupid, Rich, Selfish, and mostly mean. You need a mean girl in every TV show though, right? Anyway, this show really just lifts up your mood, no matter how cheesy it is. If you enjoy Disney channel, then you will enjoy this show. Watch it when your sad, it brings up your mood.",2014
10,"Most of Disney's shows are lame, and just not entertaining. I could watch this show all day long. This show is great for little kids, teenagers, and adults. The characters are funny, and I love how honest they are. They talk about things that I never would've thought Disney would have. They also have a lot of humor that you wouldn't believe they would say. The episode where Cody went to live with Monks, Woody makes a joke about a ""little dingy"" (a small rowboat). I just love how they aren't trying to shelter kids, and give them good jokes. Another reason why this show is so wonderful is how educational it is. They travel around the world, showing kids different heritages. I also love how good the characters are. They aren't bratty or snobby... well besides London ;) The characters are such good role models. I also love how they accept each other. All of the characters are so different, yet their good friends. London and Addison are airheads, Bailey and Cody are smart, Mr. Moseby and Ms. Tutweiler are great adult figures, Maya and Marcus are cool, and Zack and Woody are goofy. You can relate to all of them! Overall, this show is funny, educational, and just a wonderful show.",2013
10,"I loved this show so much! I laughed, I cried & I throughly enjoyed the episodes. But I was just thinking about their futures after high school. I watched all the episodes on Netflix, which by the way are out of order especially in the 3rd season. Will there be a movie to find out where all the characters are after high school? Like do Cody & Bailey get married? Where does Cody end up going to college? Is Zack, Woody, and London in college? Does Mr. Moseby and Miss Tuttwiller actually get married and where do they move to? Does Zack & Cody track them down like they said? Does the mom & Arwin finally get together? Where is Marcus in his music career?",2012
9,Suite life on deck is a great spin-off to the suite life of Zack and Cody. The episodes never cease to make me laugh. The show has really shown how much Zack and Cody have developed from before and its showing a more mature side of them.,2012
1,"Lets Just get this straight this show is the worst Disney Show of all time, in 2008, Disney was Extremely stupid to renew this show. First of all he goes to school on a bout. Second they got rid of Ashley Tisdale the only Character from the Original with actually acting talent. And Third, The show is so darn corny, the Jokes are not even funny. They are the sort of Jokes a 4th grader, might laugh at, not the mention the Disney channel aimed this shows for viewers between the age of 8 and 14. My seven year old brother stopped watching this show. This show should have ended after episode 1. Mr. Mosby is pointless in the show, Zach is a wanna be bad ass. And Cody, Who is that nerdy and is still living. Whatever you do, Do NOT WATCH THIS ISHOW IT SUCKS!!!",2011
3,"The Suite Life of Zack and Cody is a very horribly produced show. The jokes are corny and constantly re-used, characters re-use these jokes all the time, and plots are re-used. This new series offers something new, but is till far from a good and watchable show. The only thing remotely funny in both these series is Phil Lewis, but the two blonde twins are unlikeable. But this time, there is this large kid with an afro who is so messed up, he is enjoyable. What annoys me the most is the stupid laugh track, obviously fake and there isn't any effort to make it sound real. There is a major improvement of the theme song, though! It's actually catchy this time. Overall, don't watch this show unless you're 3 - 6 years old.",2008
1,"A hotel became to small for the ambitions of the Sprouse brothers so they moved to the high seas. Except for the surroundings and some alterations in the cast nothing much has changed. The Sprouse brothers still lack any talent for acting, even after all these years. They need facial contractions to make the audience aware that they did something funny. Canned laughter is used again. The surrounding cast is acting on par or even worse as if that is possible. Plot consist of situations that are used and re-used. It doesn't matter. A bad series that shows that people can get away with.. badness. ",2013
10,"The show has succeeded and the original characters are maturing and growing up as seen in the series. Tween-aged and fashion savvy girls make up the audience which makes the show very popular. It's audience is also dozens of children and tween-aged boys. Its varying fashion pieces from episode to episode makes it worth watching and also thanks to its beautiful actors that compensate for a show that's almost devoid of quality. In the acting department, most of them rely on the script and their looks, showing not more than bland expressions throughout the season and sometimes looking as though they're reciting than really acting out a range of emotions. I should be a little benign to the actress who plays London Tipton (Brenda Song) because I felt she was the only one who could brilliantly capture her character best and was able to deliver most of her lines memorably. So I beg the question, should you watch the show? Personally, yes if you are missing entertainment from your life and no, if you already have sufficient comedy in yours which is highly unlikely.",2009
3,"I accept that I saw this film post-hype. It was never going to be the Citizen Kane that people seem to think it is. But cripes, it was fluff! Not only fluff, but cold fluff: while something like Mamma Mia can draw you in with its silliness and generous humour, I felt nothing but boredom at Dev Patel's constant grump. I didn't want him to get the girl.",2009
6,Last night we went to see what the fuss was all about.,2009
10,"I also saw this film at to Toronto Film Festival. The audience gave it  a well deserved standing ovation. This story is told seamlessly. The  revealing look into the Mumbai slum is just one of the beautiful and  terrifying story lines. The use of flashbacks to tell the story took  you on a journey in time and culture. They used three sets of actors of  three different ages to move the story. The use of the youngest actors  (actually slum kids from Mumbai) stole the show. These kids were  incredible showing both the beauty and the horrors of growing up in Bombay. And that's not to take away from the amazing  performances of Freida, Dev, and the actor playing the older Saleem.  There performances moved many to tears. See this movie it won't  disappoint!",2008
9,"There has already been some talk coming from Telluride that this film is set to be this year's 'Juno.' It does have the same distributor and it is set for the same release period, and for anyone who hears this buzz, they will definitely not be disappointed.",2008
10,"Danny Boyle has been a favorite of mine since I saw Shallow Grave, since then he's gone on to make three masterpieces(Trainspotting,28 Days Later and Millions), a near perfect film(Sunshine) a guilty pleasure(The Beach) and a total miss(A Life Less Ordinary). Slumdog Millionaire comes out of nowhere and it could very well be his best film and one of the best films of the decade. Visually like Boyles previous work it's stunning, Apocalypse Now and City of God come to mind and there are dutch angles galore. The raw style mixed with the amazing locations make this film one of the most cinematic experiences you'll ever see. The Sound is perfect, I haven't heard audio like this in a while. This film needs a Sound Oscar nomination, it sounds that good. I went into seeing this knowing very little about it and the person I took with me didn't know anything about it, so I'll just say it's about a young man that goes on Indias Who Wants to be a Millionaire, it's a very unconventional film where they tell the story of his life in flashbacks while he plays the game. It's funny, sad, thrilling, basically a very enjoyable film that deserves numerous Oscar nominations. Also the lead actress is one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen, if she isn't a huge star after this I'd be extremely surprised. If the academy doesn't honor this film with numerous nominations it will be a shame but this film will be studied in 20 years and whoever sees this will love it, so even if it doesn't get a single nomination it won't matter. Don't miss this film, it's perfect!",2008
1,Because he's full frontal nude! This was not a good movie. Simple as that.,2009
1,Here's yet another extremely overrated film from 2008 catered specifically to awards and little else. Color me unimpressed.,2009
4,"Scenes of poverty and squalour may appear romantic to Westerners and to our snooty elite but for ordinary Indians they are nothing new. They are an everyday reality. However, one wonders what sort of mind can find such images aesthetically pleasing. Party-hopping socialites (for example, Shobhaa De after all her bombast of ""enough is enough"" after the Mumbai attack, went and watched a pirated copy!) who are distanced from such reality may find this film an ""eye-opener"" but for us it IS just poverty-porn. Leaving that aside, I have eight other objections to the film. 1) The director seems to RELISH showing violence. Some of it (like the police-torture) is quite needless. And why was the boy arrested in the first place? On what charge? Was it realistic? 2) How can a boy growing up in slums speak such accented English? Even if one assumes that the language he actually uses to communicate with the game-show host and the police officer is Hindi (granting the director the creative license to use a language better suited for international audiences), there are 2 instances where it is stretched too far: (a) when the boy becomes a 'guide' for foreign tourists at the Taj Mahal & (b) when he becomes a substitute-operator at the call-centre. 3) When the boy uses his 'lifeline' during the game-show, his friend discovers that she has forgotten her mobile and has to run back for it. This is plain Bollywood masala! Did the director HAVE to make it so melodramatic? 4) How did the boy know who invented the revolver just by watching his brother use it? How does his friend know about Benjamin Franklin? 5) ""Darshan Do Ghanshyam"" is NOT written by Surdas. It is written by Gopal Singh Nepali for the movie Narsi Bhagat (1957). This song is also credited as traditional and originally written by 15th century poet Narsi Mehta, whose life that film is based on. 6) After winning the game-show, the boy sits on the railway platform and nobody recognizes him! Considering the popularity of the show, is that realistic? 7) Two glaring omissions: To qualify for the show one has to answer several GK questions over phone or Internet. Even after making it to the show, a contestant can reach the hot-seat, only after ""fastest finger first"". All this is conveniently forgotten in the film. 8) And of course the greatest flaw in the storyline: programmes like 'Kaun Banega Crorepati' and 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire' are NOT telecast live. As a result the entire structure of the film becomes unrealistic. For a film that boasts of being realistic such a flaw cannot be overlooked.",2009
3,to those non-Indians and the conformist Indians here's a little bit of perspective...,2009
1,"After seeing this movie, I think members of the Oscars should be arrested and interrogated for suspicion of fraud. As others have pointed out, this film is part of a continuing trend of the Oscars trying to shove mediocre movies down our throats. It is as though the intentions of this movie were good enough to make it a ""great"" movie.",2009
10,"Danny Boyle has come up with some interesting cinema, certainly defining himself as someone above average. What he achieves in ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is transcend the line between inspiration and a miracle, awakening an emotional connection to the very special element great cinema can deliver. The packages might have changed, and the contents are more controversial and maybe a bit more tied to reality, certainly taking us to an exotic local, teaching us that our world extends beyond our freeway and limited perception of how more than the other half of the world's population has to deal without certainly preaching to us.",2008
4,"""The feel-good movie of the year!"" promises the quote headlined on the DVD jacket; and that certainly was how the movie was sold. Remembering previous movies directed by Danny Boyle--stories about miserable people in dead-end situations--I wondered what his idea of a feel-good movie would be.",2009
1,"I still can't believe how much hype is there about this movie. Whole movie is like a fairy tale from the very beginning. First they beat him up totally at the start of the movie and finally they stop, this inspector starts questioning him, he answers all the questions and he instantly believes him. Then from the question one, we know how will whole movie go and from that moment, honestly, I was just counting how many questions are left so I can get this movie over with. Also, questions in this quiz are silly easy, especially the last one which by no means should be a main prize question which can be answered by any average 10 years old kid. But still, I continue watching the movie , with a belief there has to be something original and unexpected as the movie gets near the end, having in mind how highly rated this movie is, but fair tale just keeps going on and on... I really hoped that a train would hit Latica at the end when she was going towards him to give us some dark reality which is a must in a movie which wins Oscar usually, but Na, movie ends and stupid dance sequence starts...",2009
3,"After winning eight Oscars I was all set to experience a masterpiece. I dunno, but I didn't get it. Do I need to watch it again? Is this a new genre? What am I missing? I did not enjoy the cinema theater experience - as I rented it and watched it in HD. That might've contributed to my lack of understanding or sensory deprivation.",2009
6,"Probable Oscar nominee didn't float my boat. Its a good film but I don't know whether too many people have told me how great it is or is it not that great and people are simply reacting to the exotic nature of the film, either way it didn't blow my skirt up.",2009
1,"Since it received no less than 8 Oscars, I foresaw that Slumdog would not be of my liking, but I was frankly still baffled that the picture did not even meet my poorest of expectations, turning out to be just another overcheesed melodrama and an altogether quixotic mess of a film.",2009
1,"This movie should rank as one of the worst movies of the decade if not the century! The script is painfully flawed and deliberately manipulative and full of clichés about India. It just takes those painfully little things the west thinks it knows of India (Slums, poverty, beggars, TajMahal, call centers, bollywood ) and paints it in the most horrifying way! The flaws in the script are so glaring and far from reality that it is preposterous to even consider this film for an Award worth its salt! For any Indian some of these things below are just laughable -",2009
10,"I just saw this at the Savannah Film Festival (on Friday October 31st, 2008), held by the Savannah College Of Art and Design (SCAD) and as soon as the credits started rolling for this movie the first word that came out of my mouth was ""WOW!!!"" This movie is easily one of the best of 2008, I honestly don't know how the people have given this movie a average rating of 7 here on IMDb. This movie is the heart wrenching tale of a person who has everything he ever loved taken away from him, only to try with everything that he has to regain his true love and gain more than he could ever hope. It is preformed and put together in such a way that it forgets and bypasses every love story cliché. The movie starts out a little confusing but is very quickly sorted out and understood. Danny Boyle has made a film that inspires and encourages people of all ages.",2008
6,I'm honestly surprised about the recognition and buzz about this film throughout the world. And 10 Oscar nominations!! Man.! How are stupidity and ridiculousness instantly absorbed and appreciated by people without hesitation? OK. let me be pragmatic in my turning down this film as average.,2009
10,"I won't see a better, more exhilarating movie this year than Danny Boyle's ""Slumdog Millionaire."" If Academy voters have any sense, they will nominate this for Best Picture and Best Director and then vote overwhelmingly for it for both awards.",2008
10,"Slumdog Millionaire, the best film of 2008 by far, I saw this back in December after hearing a little bit about it on the net. I was so excited to see that it was playing at my local theater and I didn't hesitate to see it when it was released. There are a lot of people who are just asking why this film is so popular or loved, the reason why in my opinion is that it's just a happy film. We usually have a best picture winner that is depressing, but instead Slumdog Millionaire just lifts your spirits and makes you cry in joy. I couldn't believe how much I loved this film, after reading a summary on what it was about, I was just confused and wondering if this film was really going to be good. But we have these unknown young actors: Dev Peitel, Freida Pinto and Madhur Mittal who pull in heart wrenching performances and you can't help but love their characters and just keep rooting for them. All in all, this film is a love story. Most film lovers fear those words after Titanic because everyone thought it to be a predictable puppy love story, this love story however is made in strength and faith and you can't help but keep wanting Jamal and Latika to be together. Even though I saw the film a while back, I still remember it like I saw it yesterday.",2009
6,"It's never good to watch a movie with great expectations. Either you just get what you waited for anyway or you are completely disappointed. Well, what's wrong with Slumdog Millionaire? Maybe I shouldn't have read anything about it before watching - but as it won so many Oscars, it's hard not to find out anything about it. So the storyline was clear - some poor boy from the Mumbai slums gets the opportunity to win a lot of money. And the movie somehow has to point out how it is actually possible for somebody who dropped out of school as a child to know all these answers.",2009
10,"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a film unlike any I've ever seen and probably ever will. A true epic that left me utterly speechless. It accomplished so much through such simplicity. Everything was top notch from the elegant directing to the subtly wonderful performances down to the magical score. The film demands you to feel not only for the death we witness, but for the incredible life we discover. It prays on the obvious morality issues we all deal with but also dangles the idea in front of us that everyone goes through the same joys and grievances, just not in the same way. This is a momentous tale that deserves nothing less than the title of brilliance. ",2008
10,"Before seeing The Curious Case of Benjamin Button I wondered how I would react to the story of a man who is born old and gets younger as he grows up. Of all of the stories I have come across, this is by far the most bizarre and intriguing. If i had to pick someone to bring this story to the screen I do no think David Fincher would have been my first choice.",2008
9,"Possibly the most anticipated winter film of 2008, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a curious film indeed. It's got an intriguing and completely absorbing story, as well as my favorite director, David Fincher, on the top of his game. With ""Button"", Fincher cements his place as one of the best directors alive, as his film is nothing short of magical, mesmerizing, riveting, ground breaking, and ultimately, timeless.",2008
7,"""The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button"" would seem to have everything going for it - major stars, an enormous budget, and a conceit that can't be beat. However, in the end it's that very conceit that hamstrings an otherwise wondrous piece of movie-making.",2008
8,"I found this to be an interesting film; certainly not boring as I had heard from a few people who saw it in the theater. To me, it was simply good storytelling.",2009
8,"I had been awaiting to see this movie for some time. Alas, it was Christmas Day and you bet I was there to see the movie on opening day. I set my expectations really high on this film. I expected nothing short of brilliance with a film coming from director David Fincher, director of the masterful ""Zodiac"" and screenwriter Eric Roth, writer of the classic ""Forrest Gump"". The acting is brilliant in the movie. Brad Pitt and the marvelous Cate Blanchett share a fire that resonates so effortlessly out to the audience. Other performances are notable as well, such as Taraji P. Henson's as Benjamin's mother, and Tilda Swinton's as Benjamin's first lover. Another notable achievement in the film is the visual effects; none of it is overdone and it is quite convincing. The music in the film is great as well. The haunting and mythical music is composed by Alexandre Desplat. One thing that did surprise me in the film was the amount of comedy present, but I guess comedy's needed for a tale with such sorrow. I really do think that this film is a classic. And I would go and see it again. When I was walking out of the theater, some people complained that the movie was very good, but that it was too long. I disagree; I actually didn't want it to end. It's the perfect film to watch all snuggled up in a blanket during the dead of winter. All things aside, this movie is about the short time we're given with life and how we are to make the most of it. Even with a story as fictional as Benjamin Button's, the message rings true.",2008
4,"The disappointment I feel is perhaps more for David Fincher's career than this film. Everything on the surface of 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' appears beautiful - the cinematography, the special effects, the make-up, the cast... everything is about eye candy. It is sweet but like sweets containing high glucose corn syrup, it leaves one irritable and certainly dissatisfied. ",2008
10,"This film is worthy of a 10/10 rating simply because of its imaginative and complex nature, I mean, I couldn't bring myself to know why this simple idea of a man aging backwards hadn't sprouted up before. Set all the way back at the end of the Great War, to New Orlean's meeting with Hurricane Katrina, this movie tells the story of Benjamin Button, a baby born an old man of eighty, destined to die in the mere form of a zero-year-old. I found this movie very emotional and special because there's reeally nothing like it. I honestly thought, when I found out the immense length of the film, it was going to be boring....I was wrong, it gripped me from start to finish. There are many emotional and touching scenes in it, including the end, where it brings forth Benjamin Button's 'younger' years as an old man. Nothing went wrong with the cast, Brad Pitt played a great job as a reverse-aging man, and Cate went well as his childhood friend. Overall, this movie was great and I recommend it to anyone who loves the genre.",2009
6,"When I first heard that Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett's new film The Curious Case of Benjamin Button was destined to join the ""sweepers"" at the 2009 Oscars I knew that I had to check the film out to see if the rumors were true. Go back in time a little to when the film was first announced. David Fincher (Fight Club, Zodiac) was set to direct with a script from Eric Roth (Munich, The Insider) based off of an F. Scott Fitzgerald short story of the same title. The aspects of the crew were locked and had me somewhat interested. Then the cast list was announced with Brad Pitt (The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, Twelve Monkeys) and Cate Blanchett (I'm Not There., Coffee and Cigarettes) headlining the list, to say the least, it had my attention. I rarely get hyped up for super-mainstream films anymore with all of the disappointments that have occurred in the past. Luckily enough I was given the chance to attend a press screening on December 4th for this film and left well, satisfied. Given the fact that I was underwhelmed by the trailers, being satisfied is certainly saying something.",2008
8,"Brad Pitt makes his mark as an actor here as Benjamin Button, a man with a strange disorder - physically aging backwards. Along his emotional journey of life he encounters friends, family, loved ones, adventures, and most of all, chances.",2009
9,"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button was a near epic film in almost the same way Forrest Gump was. I am not particularly a fan of David Fincher and his work. Yet I strongly admired The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. This film is about a man named Benjamin Button who leads much of an ordinary life under not so ordinary circumstances. The one thing that separates him from any other human being is that he ages backwards. Despite such large differences between the audience and Benjamin Button, the film finds a way to connect with a large variety of people in a way that does not seem to happen so often.",2009
7,"Technically, like most of Davin Fincher's movies, ""The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button"" is a wonder. The curious saga of a man ageing backwards, gives Fincher the possibility of doing what he does best, tricks. It is the drama part that he doesn't seem to master or perhaps he doesn't care. ""Zodiac"" was his most coherent dramatic venture. Here he gets infatuated by the CGI and manages some spectacular punches but it is thanks to Brad Pitt the the exercise has a soul. He is truly remarkable. He manages to overcome the distraction of the gadgetry and show us the interior of the man. Brad Pitt's warmth wins over David Fincher's coldness and the most successful parts of the film are reflected in Brad Pitt's eyes. Geared towards an inexorable ending, there are moments of real beauty and tenderness. I'm convinced those moments could have been captured with a Super 8. The over direction of Fincher puts the emotional undertone in real jeopardy but, thankfully, the overall experience is mostly a welcome and rewarding one.",2009
1,"I don't understand the appeal of this film. It has no plot (which is not necessarily a bad thing. Another Fincher/Pitt collaboration from 1999 comes to mind), the protagonist has no goal, and the film basically has no conflict.",2009
1,"Honestly, I cannot start out saying anything other than this movie was complete rubbish from the ground up. At first sight, it seems to hold such promise: an interesting hook, renowned actors, as well as being based on a short (HA! more on that later...) story of F. Scott Fitzgerald's. I even paid to see it non-matinée the week it was released- a rarity for me. Yet all the overblown actors and excessive ad campaigns and self-congratulating awards shows in the world could not disguise what this film truly was.",2009

1,"I wasn't particularly enthralled with the idea of this film before seeing it but there was nothing else good on, so I gave it a try. An interesting idea for a film, that he grows physically younger but mentally develops in the normal way. However, this leads to many inconsistencies in the storyline. It doesn't make sense that Benjamin, when he becomes a father, decides to leave and travel the world. He looks of the age to do something like this but he's meant to be more mature... And when he's an old man in a young boy's body, he has a tantrum like a young boy would, but that doesn't fit the idea of the story, either... When trying to find the point to this whole story, all it comes down to is that we should look after those close to us and take more care of them. Well, that's an original one! To me, it became extremely boring as there is never any deep meaning to it and it just keeps dragging on for far too long when you can see that it's quite a stupid idea to put into a film. The anecdotes in the story, the acting and the direction are all good but in the end, what's the point?",2009
10,"After having developed pretty much the most successful directorial career of the decade, Fincher just refuses to hold back his enormous talent, always picking the risky projects and churning out an exhilarating piece of work. He's come a long way as it is, and then comes along the curious ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"". The title speaks for itself. The result can be anything between a predictable romantic drama, or a stirring, magical, unforgettable, heartbreaking, intelligent, challenging experience. I'm sure you can tell which direction I'm headed.",2008

4,"My boyfriend and I had been looking foreword to seeing this movie for about two weeks, when we finally got to see it yesterday afternoon. We knew about the high ratings on this site as well as in our local newspaper, and by general word-of-mouth. What a disappointment. It was slow, bland, only occasionally humorous, slow, unintelligent, devoid of conjuring up real emotion, slow, silly, and the main character was not very likable-- just a horny womanizer fleeing from love and responsibility. About two hours through, my bf forced me to walk out and leave with him. I say forced only because I hate walking out on ANY film, no matter how awful, and I hate losing my hard-earned money. Even though I didn't see the entire film, I still feel the need to comment on what I did see, especially because I found out the details of what happened after we left... just more cowardice, silliness, womanizing, and a continuously slow plot-line. Perhaps I'll give it another chance when it comes out on TV, or if I have nothing better to do and I don't have to pay to see it.",2009

6,"To call The Curious Case of Benjamin Button a masterpiece (as some people have been doing), has got to be the biggest misnomer of this year. Whilst it's an OK movie, it's by no means the masterpiece many are purporting it to be. I really do take issue with people spuriously calling movies of today masterpieces, especially when such an adjective is unwarranted. So, let's just say that this is a ""masterpiece"", are we to believe that it's on a par with the likes of ""Citizen Kane"", ""Gone With The Wind"" or even ""The Godfather""? all of which I would deem to be masterpieces - I think not. The reality is that it doesn't even come close to any of the aforementioned movies, not to mention a myriad of others that I could mention.",2009
4,"13 Oscar nominations, including best picture and actor, one would think WOW what a great film! WRONG. The con with this film is that it looks very impressive but has no real depth, soul, and is very uninteresting. The story is loosely based on a very old and short comic-book like story by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The screen play, adapted by Eric Roth, gives it the old Forest Gump feel and starts out reasonably well. However, the character of Benjamin Button, a man who has a rare condition of ageing backwards but his mind ages forwards, is boring, unlikable and downright annoying! There are scenes in which Benjamin just mopes about feeling sorry for himself, bemused and confused! Yea, well wouldn't you be? I mite, but this man has a roof over his head, a family that have cared for him and raised him, albeit he was ditched by his real father and left on their doorstep, but he had a pretty solid homestead considering he was born in the 1920's. He grows up gets a job on fishing boat, and travels the world to rekindle the flame of his childhood sweetheart.",2009
1,"This summary subject came from a review in the LA Weekly. It was so funny I thought you might appreciate it. Honestly this film was ridiculous. The ending was so un-intendingly funny that I couldn't stop laughing. I thought she was going to actually inhale the baby Benjamin into her womb to complete the cycle. There were many things about this film that was just plain stupid, but having to have Brad pit go back to the actual infant form was just insane. I keep trying to figure out why when a white baby was raised by a black mother in the 20's, 30's and on wasn't ever an issue with anyone in a very racist town like New Orleans in the south. It was never an issue in the film. If you like seeing plastic faces or shamelessly trying to get you get a tear in your eye with nonsense character development then this might be the film for you... Or not....",2008
9,"So a few weeks ago, my sister and I decided to watch a movie and wanted to see Titanic again, so of course we get to the sad ending where Jack dies, but Rose lived on to have an incredible life, I asked my sister ""I wonder what would've happened if Jack lived? Would he and Rose really have lasted like they thought they would have?"", she giggled and asked if I saw Revolutionary Road, I said no and she said to see this movie and my question would be answered. So here's something I never thought I would say, especially in 1997, thank God Jack died! OK, sorry for the lousy introduction, I always like to say how I saw the movie. But I didn't just want to see Revolutionary Road because of the reunion between the extremely talented Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, but also one of my favorite directors of all time Sam Mendes(American Beauty) who took on this project in the new telling of what the American Dream is and maybe it's not always what we had expected it to be.",2009

10,"A show-stopping Leonardo DiCaprio becomes Frank Wheeler, with remarkable power and an insight we only get from the greatest kind of actors. Allowing the audience to become fully immersed in his psyche, letting us feel everything with him. Living his pain, resentment, and the smörgåsbord of emotions in between. It is a highly accomplished piece of acting from the lead actor that I cannot imagine being ignored come this award season. Frank is a flawed man that many people will be able to see aspects of themselves in. Not being satisfied with marriage, family, work. Feeling we are meant or destined for something greater, yet paradoxically feeling the doubt and insecurity in ourselves to really go after it. He's depressed, has a past he can't seem to let go of, he's arrogant, he's a liar, he's manipulative and in many ways immature. Yet we know him. He's our father growing up, he's a brother, friend or possibly even you. He makes mistakes and is almost embarrassingly human. What I found ultimately tragic about him was not the way in which he lied to others but the way in which he lied to himself. Leo DiCaprio uses his expressive face to brilliant effect as Frank. He was terrific in ""Aviator"" , ""Blood Diamond"", ""This Boy's Life"" and others and has rightfully earned his place as one of the finest actors of his generation. Having said that, this is a whole new layer to DiCaprio that none of us have seen before. He brings a new, mature type of authentic subtlety to his craft. He doesn't resort to any big physical transformation. It's all internal. This is a new height for him, and easily the greatest acting of his career. A performance of great emotional intensity and depth that I can say without hesitation, will be remembered for generations to come.",2008
8,"Having been a 50s housewife with children at home and a husband who wanted to be anywhere but there, this movie was familiar territory. How many of us in those years simply packed our dreams away for the immediate necessity of putting food on the table and paying the mortgage? Di Caprio is outstanding, as is Winslet, she having to deal with an American accent along with the tearing emotions. I didn't see that anyone picked up on the final scene, of Kathy Bates and her husband, but to me that was the whole moral of the story - here is where you will end up if you give in to what you know is not right for you. Overall, though, well done - except women in the 50s did NOT wear hats to work!!",2009
8,"I went to see this at an advanced screener in Leicester Square last night. Kate Winslett chatted about the film on stage afterward. I went as one of those people who'd read the book and consider that source material to be amongst the best literature I'd ever read. I was wondering if and how the film could match up. My prior concerns were about how accurate the film would be. Well, there's nothing to worry about there. Mendes has created a near carbon copy of the book, the locations, characters and scenes are all exactly as I 'saw' them on the page. Nothing (as far as I could tell) is portrayed out of order, no extra characters are introduced, and no primary characters are dropped or altered. The acting is 100% perfect. The mies-en-scene is perfect. Absolutely nothing could or should have been done differently. So why not 10/10? The problem lies in the fact that Yates' novel is a literary one, much of the essence of the experience of the story is realized by Yates with just the right turn of phrase or choice of word. How does a director set about depicting or capturing this visually? I don't think he really can, he needs to use cinematic tricks and devices to inject resonance, the same resonance Yates achieves with that turn of phrase. But in being so (probably rightly) concerned about being true to the source material, the film somehow comes up a little flat as a film going experience, a sort of American Beauty without the crucial stylistic bells and whistles. Kate Winslett said afterward that (interestingly) it was she who had brought the book and the project to her husband, not vice versa and that it took some consideration for Sam Mendes to convince himself that he hadn't already told this story before, and by the final credits, I too was thinking just that, it felt like I'd watched a prequel to American Beauty, but without the pizazz and the rapture and the delight. So, the book, 10/10, the film, 8/10.",2008

9,"Revolutionary Road has been adapted from the same named novel of Richard Yates. The setting is a suburban area on the east coast in the mid-1950s. Surely there have been many changes of values in gender, society, and family over the decades. Yet,Revolutionary Road, whether the film or the novel, has never lost its power of confronting us, people living in the globalized 21st century, with all the existential issues – questions about life. This is the only movie that I have ever seen which can pose philosophical questions directly yet without compromising the engaging power of drama to its audience. It throws at us with questions about the meaning of life, our responsibility to live an authentic life, our freedom to make choices and decisions, our desire to connect with others and maintain independence, the fine line between the sane and the insane, the limitations of life, etc. ",2008
8,"Without the great presence of Dicaprio and Winslet this film would seriously be at the level of a TV movie. Revolutionary Road is a film that certainly will not cheer you up. It is about a husband and wife who make an attempt at escaping there their ""empty and hopeless"" life. Or at least they create the delusion that they will.",2009
10,"Just saw this movie. All I can say is: Wow! In this Richard Yates story portrayed through the lens of Mr. Mendes' camera, we enter the relationship of Frank and April Wheeler; a young married couple depicted brilliantly by DiCaprio and Winslet, who seem to be on the verge of marital and emotional collapse as their growing desperation and dissatisfaction with their town and their relationship leads them to think of an escape. There are some compelling, memorable, emotionally gripping scenes between DiCaprio and Winslet, which should interest acting students who wish to know what it means to be ""in the moment"". Additionally, there is the immensely talented Kathy Bates, whose humorous scenes balance out the heavily dramatic ones nicely and which are sure to leave a warm spot on your heart. Also adding humor to the movie is Michael Shannon as Bates' psychologically unstable son, who steals just about every scene he's in. There are moments where the dialogue can seem to feel cliché, but with everything else working so well, those moments can be forgiven. This is a film not to be missed. I've become a greater admirer of DiCaprio's acting ability as a result of this film, Winslet never disappoints, and Mendes adds another superb credit to his resume with this amazing film.

1,"Wow I am shocked at how bad this film was! It was a boring, pointless 2  hour pain that I am surprised has gotten so many great reviews. I think  many posters on here miss the point when people like me complain about  the movie. I thought Winslet was okay, but seemed mannered and  annoying. DiCaprio was just flat out annoying in this. He sounded like  a 15 year-old boy at his first high school play. Both actors seemed,  again, far too young to be playing these characters.  The film lacks story arc, structure, and most importantly...CHARACTER  DEVELOPMENT! One of the first things they teach you in film school (Mr.  Mendes) is that you need to have CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT to make your  audience care about what's happening to the people on screen. This  movie opens up with Kate and Leo fighting. We don't care about the  fight, however, because we don't know who the hell these people are. As  the movie progresses, we still don't see anything hint about who these  people are. He works at a boring job. She's a housewife. Gee, like we  never have seen one of these stories be told before. And then- nothing  happens! There's no plot! The movie is an excuse for Winslet and  DiCaprio to have yelling matches together. It's like watching a VH1  reality show shot in 35mm. What's more, we don't feel or care about the  characters. When ever Winslet cried, I cringed. It's being touted as  one of her best performances? Really? I thought it was mannered,  controlled and whiny. She's done billions times better then this stuff.  And DiCaprio is just flat-out BAD. Perhaps I would think they did  better jobs if I cared at all about the movie's premise.  On top of this, the film is morbidly predictable, and cliché.  (SPOILER!) When Kate is ""Upset"" one morning, and having a fit in the  kitchen, Leo asks her what's wrong. It's so blatantly obvious she's  pregnant, and having ""Morning Cramps"". And then of course, she says she  wants an abortion. I knew what was going to happen before it did.  Mendes, a master of storytelling with American BEAUTY and ROAD TO  PERDITION, fails so low here I almost feel bad for him. Every shot of  this movie looks like its designed for Academy Awards in the Art  Direction and Cinematography department. But there's no substance at  all to the storytelling. Every shot is a silhouette or closeup of  boring dramatic angles that mean nothing other then to have dumb  audiences go ""Oooo, now that's a great camera angle."" If this movie  gets nominations from the Oscars (which it will), I will know its  because those voters haven't seen the movie yet, and are voting for it  on name bases alone.  FINAL GRADE: F",2009

For myself, I have always loved Downey Jr. from his excellent portrayal as Charlie Chapin, to his perfectly suited role in Shane Black's Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, he is always the best thing about a film.

The audacity of what he was attempting, spoofing the industry that was giving him the money to do so, blatantly and lovingly, was too great to ignore. And then there is the cast of stars with cameo after cameo of surprise faces joining in on the fun, not to mention the intense marketing strategy pushing it along. Websites for each fictional actor, a site with clips from the Rain of Madness making of documentary (a Heart of Darkness send up ""directed"" by co-writer Justin Theroux), and even a faux E! True Hollywood Story to air the week before its premiere in theatres just add to the mythology and attention to detail that went into its making. Now, having finally seen the end result, I must say it didn't let me down. True, I was expecting more in the way of story and plot, especially with all that background info manufactured, but when you get down to it, the entertainment value is off the charts, the one-liners are going to be quoted for years to come, and the laughs come often and hard.",2008

10,"""Tropic Thunder is a film that understands biting satire. It sets out to villainize the very people that made the film possible. It understands parody and it understands good comedy and delivers consistent laughs throughout. It starts out with a promising bang and from there, continues to revel in its absurdity and wit. The script is sharp and provides a great basis for the humor that spurs the film on, however, it's truly the actors that take it to the next level. Robert Downey Jr's performance as the lost Australian actor is perhaps one of the most standout performances in a comedy. Not only that, but Tom Cruise's Les may just be the engine that brings this film home. Its both ridiculous and a furnace of hilarity. But in all truth, the chemistry within the rest of the cast is undeniable. I would have to caution viewers, this film may not be what you're expecting. Ben Stiller's previous films and even his own written ""Zoolander"" are quite different from the tone and the visuals of Tropic Thunder. And its not just in the profanity or utter gore, its within the concepts behind the film. It dares to go into areas that are politically incorrect and what say may even find on the offensive side. Its not afraid to traverse the areas outside of hands-off comedy. Like I said, this could be satire at is very best, and its got the cast and the laughs to prove it. If you're a fan of balls- to-wall, brazen comedy that isn't afraid of the lines, this will be your cup of tea. You'll be laughing from start to finish and reveling in the ride. It's fresh and that originality carries it somewhere great. There is a total lack of predictability and its shies away from the clichés and THAT is something I think a lot of films haven't been ballsy enough to do."" -another critic",2008
9,"I went to see this at an advance showing last night and spent much of the time laughing. The beginning as previously mentioned is extremely creative with a clever cameo from Tobey Maguire and once the movie begins it is non-stop humor from start to finish. The star of the movie by far is Robert Downey Jr who is simply perfect but the real scene stealer is Tom Cruise, though his screen time is limited, his scenes are hilarious. Definitely one to repair the somewhat tarnished image of the past few years. Stiller is his usual self but is overshadowed by Black and Downey Jr. not surprising given the multiple roles he played behind the scenes. Wall to wall cameos, particularly at the end (blink and you'll miss them) and I really won't tell you which the funniest cameo was as that may spoil this gem of a joke....provided you catch it that is! highly recommended movie - I will definitely be heading out to see it when it comes out for general audiences!",2008
7,"Saw this at the Washington, DC screening on the 10th.",2008
3,"Every now and then a movie comes out that leaves its audience asking how in God's name did this film ever get made? How did the pitch go to its producers ...? Let me see if I've got this straight: You want to make a comedy about some pampered actors making a Vietnam movie who are purposely thrown into an actual confrontation to lend some realism to the operation? Then you see who produced the film -- the actual film -- and then you start to understand: Ben Stiller, the star of the movie -- actual and fictional.",2008
1,"There's a scene in this film about how to act a moron, but not be moronic. Unfortunately this film is moronically bad, and anybody who thinks it's funny must be a m.... Filled with so-so stars of modern cinema, it is an attempt to be a satire on Hollywood and its maleness/action movies along with a cheap way of getting laughs out of taking the rise out of Platoon, Rambo etc. Tucked away of course is the irony that Hollywood cannot sell an Iraq war movie, but can make a fortune out of a comedy about the tragedy of Vietnam - got that teen redneck dudes! It just is not funny, just a series of apparently good jokes (how Hollywood portrays a black man) totally and utterly stretched beyond any sense of humour. And in doing so, merely repeats the clichés of martial Americanness - Masters of the Universe - where even liars about their army service get good ol US salvation! And when are the likes of Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, Ferrell, Carell, Vaughn, Rogen going to get off our screens? All we get are so-called slacker nerds triumphing at love, war, drugs and all that jazz - the complete and ultimate male fantasies. Of course they do it all with that post-modernist, deconstuctionist, ironic flavour, but, unlike their forebears - Bob Hope, Jack Benny, Jack Lemmon - they are neither funny nor particularly attractive as characters! Please can real gag writers get back to the big screen.",2008
4,"I couldn't believe the lack of wit or of genuine new ideas. It targets the lowest possible denominator and it succeeds. The moronic objective, presumably, is to make you laugh with a shallow parody of Hollywood and war movies, celebrity and all the rest. The whole thing may have worked for me if it hadn't been so jarringly self conscious. I like Ben Stiller as an actor and as a director and even here he has a couple of moments but I was depressed by the outcome. It may just be me, I grant you that, people laughed like crazy all around me. Every fart provoked loud guffaws. Robert Downey Jr in black face and Tom Cruise bald and with a pot belly. Yeah, yeah, yeah.",2008
1,"No spoilers but I flagged it anyway - there's no ""spoiling"" what's thoroughly rancid all on its own. Apparently one of the seminar posters who've flooded this film entry with bogus rave reviews found mine ""offensive"" so I'm having to dumb it down (appropriate to its subject,) and re-post it. Maybe these studio employees a tad thin-skinned. Tsk.",2008
8,"I was lucky enough to see what they said was the first public showing of this movie to a test audience on February 19th in Phoenix AZ. Security was tight, lots of metal detector wands, airport type security walk through, ladies purses inspected, no cell phones allowed in. They want to make sure no one is filming or taking snapshots of the movie. It is very funny, Ben Stiller is the star and is a fiction action star with lots of films to his credit. While filing in Vietnam they stumble into a war with drug lords who think they are DEA. Stiller and cast believe there are hidden cameras and they are still in production making their epic film. Tom Cruise also stars and when he appeared I told my wife there is Tom Cruise, at the end of the movie she said which one was Tom Cruise? Go figure, he is not playing the Tom we know and love from Top Gun. As the first test audience we answered questions about the movie and some viewers were selected for a discussion panel afterwards. This should appeal to Ben's fans as well as anyone wanting a laugh filled evening.",2008
2,"I must admit I did laugh a lot whilst watching this, but that doesn't make this a good film, or a good comedy for that matter. Imagine if you will, taking someone on a night out with bunch of your old school friends, mates from a sports team that you play in etc. You have a great laugh at all the in jokes and times you spent together, but your guest cannot see the fun because they just weren't there. Maybe one or two of the stories were funny to outsiders, but for the most part unless you are part of that community it all just goes over their heads. ",2008
1,"Having heard and seen the multitude of great reviews for this, my wife and I attended expecting a laugh riot. However, despite what I'd heard, this movie was not remotely funny. I might've chuckled once or twice - my wife made not a peep. The audience we saw it with - in a theater that was about half full - chuckled here and there, though, not consistently and never with the entire crowd.",2008
1,"Tom Cruise was hilarious, Jack Black was marginally funny and everything else just sucked. I went for a bathroom break during the last 30 min. just to have something else to look at. I LOVE Robert Downey Jr., but his character was so dull it was almost physically painful to watch. And Ben Stiller? Good grief- he needs to drop all Zoolander-ish roles pronto. That's exactly how I would describe his character in this movie- Zoolander get stuck in the jungle. Nick Nolte seemed bland to put it mildly. I'm completely stunned that someone of RBJ Jr's caliber would have anything to do with this movie. He must have lost a bet. To say that he was slumming would be the understatement of the century. At least Tom Cruise proved he can still be funny- and without jumping on couches or punching the air. Save your money.",2008
1,"I went to see this film as I noticed it had Jack Black in it, and I thought he was so funny in things like Empire Records, and School of Rock, (and also in Tenacious D - some of his music vids are superb like Tribute). But then I go and see this and I am seriously let down. I expected Jack Black to be totally off his head proper rock-n-roll style, going in attacking the enemy in a proper rock-n-roll style like he did in School of Rock, but for most of the film Jack is pretending to be a stoned out actor, that can't concentrate on anything but drugs for more than five seconds. There was one or two funny bits in the film, like the Panda scene, the bat scene and the bit where Jack is going cold turkey and is tied to the tree, but the rest of the film was the most boring load of rubbish I've ever seen. All the actors were supposed to be actors from rubbish movies, making a rubbish movie that turns out really good, but this film just makes really good actors look really rubbish. Possibly the worst scene in the whole film was the Forrest Gump bit where they make fun of Forrest Gump, I think that could have been so much funnier if Jack Black had been doing that and it had been about someone who was ADHD, 'cos then Jack Black could really have gone off on one in his usual hypo style. I also found that Forrest Gump section very insulting towards people with disabilities, I have Asperger's and ADHD and found it really poorly done, without any consideration for people watching the film who have learning disabilities.",2008
1,I think I'm going to soon have to stop looking at the IMDb ratings altogether because they often give no indication whatsoever of the quality of the movie.,2008
2,this movie was the exact opposite of funny?,2008
1,Being from the UK I'm assuming I'm missing something here. This film sounded like it had all the ingredients for a great Saturday night at the cinema but in the end I was left annoyed and feeling cheated of a night.,2008
1,"I had a difficult time sitting through this movie. It appears to be a movie for high school boys who still laugh at farts. Toward the end I did at least smile a couple of times. I think this movie shows just how far our society has gone with gross jokes,insensitively toward various groups (such as Vietnam War Veterans), and phrases that should not be uttered outside of the ""gutter"". I was also surprised to see a boy about the age of 12 in the movie(he appeared to be with his Mother). However, after saying this, I realize that 12-year-old boys are probably who this was written for. Maybe Ben Stiller can actually find a script in the future that might just actually be humorous.",2008
3,"I went to the movies a couple of weeks ago with my best friend Rick, to see this and Death Race. We both had wanted to see this from watching the previews and promotions; Death Race was his idea. I had no interest in watching a movie that resembles Twisted Metal. Anyways, long story short, I ended up loving Death Race and hating Tropic Thunder. Seeing it last was a mistake too. I was falling asleep. My complaints for this movie is that it's made out to be soooo goddamn funny and it's not. It has some good jokes here and there (mostly by RDJ) but it's not a comedy treasure. That quote from the trailer after the movie came out, ""You'll Be Quoting This Movie Forever"", is seriously wrong. It should say, ""You Will Be Quoting RDJ's Lines Forever"". Also, Jack Black, who I usually like and I think is funny, sucked in this movie. He barely does anything in the movie or help it progress. It was a waste to have him in it. I'm a big fat guy--I could have been in the movie as his character and it would be the same thing! Ben Stiller, who gets a lot of flack, was okay in this. Although the Simple Jack thing was a little funny (when they show the trailer) it became really annoying. I am also disabled but it didn't offend me. I just figured, if this is the best they can do, then maybe I'm not so disabled after all. This is surprisingly a movie that you should wait till it comes out on DVD. Not worth the $8.50; not worth all the hype...",2008
10,"I was lucky enough to catch an advance screening of this movie on June 26 in Dallas and let me say that this movie is brilliant. It starts off with fake trailers from the 3 big actors (Stiller, Black and Downey Jr.) and doesn't stop there. The beginning is a tad slow, but once the men get to their ""filming location"" the film picks back up again. The best part of this movie for me, besides the performance of Downey Jr., was the smaller parts contributing to the overall whole of the movie. Danny McBride was hilarious, as was Steve Coogan as first time director Damien. Get ready for multiple cameos in this movie, as there is well over 15 solid ones. The only part I didn't like in this movie was the leader of the gang that captures Ben Stiller, but I quickly got over it and saw the movie as being funnier with him in it. Edgy comedy, mixed with great action and great character development made this movie one of the best comedies I have seen in years and I cannot urge everyone to go see this movie enough.",2008

10,"The most thrilling movie I've seen in a long time. Neeson is what we would fear if James Bond went to hell and came back for revenge (I doubt big budget Quantum of Solace will top this). I loved Jason Bourne; but where Bourne is confused for half the movie, Neeson is looking down a barrel of a pistol 3/4 of the time. In a three way spy battle, I would put Neeson edging out Bourne, who would be a step ahead of Bond.",2008
8,"First thing to say is, this is a great and fun movie from beginning to end. If you like the Bourne titles then you will love this movie. The fighting style and the way things get done is similar to Matt Damon's character and it doesn't get old and is interesting and great to watch throughout the whole film.",2008
9,"Just saw the movie in the sneak preview. First of all this movie will get a lot of those people who will whine about everything that is not realistic really (If you are one of those, you'll have a lot to whine about). But if you can just enjoy a movie as its intended to be and you appreciate some action this movie is near perfect. The main character is so pure and non complex. Finally an action movie that doesn't try to give some oddities to the characters to make them more interesting but just straightforward high speed action .",2008
9,"A no nonsense, kick the crap out of everyone who gets in your way action movie. Liam Neeson's character is the angry love child of Bourne,Bond and all the other pretenders put together. If I was asked to cast the movie I guess he wouldn't have been my first choice but having seen it I can't think of anyone else I'd rather have in the role. The fight choreography is bone crunchingly good. This is one kick ass flick and one I will definitely buy on DVD. There's little doubt who the bad guys are and they get a very satisfactory smack in the mouth - when they aren't being shot or electrocuted. This was made by people who like the genre and know how to get an action movie from A to Z. I can't help but giggle at those reviews that mention plot and probability in this kind of movie. What kind of movie did they think they were going to see?",2009
8,"I saw this movie tonight at the sneak preview and I was completely surprised and blown away. I went to see this movie with no expectations. In the beginning it seems that it was going to be an easy to watch movie, but after a short time it turned into a high-speed action movie. I found the story original and so did my friends. At some times I found it hard to watch, because of the drug abuse and violence. To know that these practices still occur also gave me a horrible feeling. I was completely taken away by this movie. At some points it was very very quiet in the cinema, because of the excitement, you wonder what is going to happen next. Some moments in the story I found a bit not convincing, but the rest of the movie makes up to that. Liam Neeson in one of his best performances. It had good action, a good story, some humor. There are also some sensitive / sentimental scenes. There are no plot twists. It is just a story being told. This is one of those movies which stay in your memory for a while and let you think about bad things that happen. The movie that had that same effect on me was Traffic (2000). Personally I think this movie is underrated, but maybe this is because it is new. I would give it 8/10.",2008
10,"I'm still under the influence of this movie, so my comment is likely to be superlative! I went to this movie, knowing that one of the writers and the director were both French, and since I've seen some not-so-impressive movies (almost fell asleep), i was really skeptical.",2008
9,"I absolutely love these kind of movies. Taken is awesome when it comes to how fast the story moves and leaves the viewer thinking what next. The scenes are well shot, the movie is absorbing and acting simply superb, to the point and no nonsense. Liam Neeson does justice to his role as a retired CIA agent trying to get his daughter back. By the time the movie finished I wanted more and thankfully we now have Taken 2 coming, just hoping its as good as the original one.",2012
10,"Gone to see Liam Neeson, I've just seen a great movie. Much action, some American humour (you Americans don't take it too serious, and that's just as pleasant taht way !), a Liam Neeson at the top of his art and as a background a very hard subject that makes you think about it (procuring). I don't know how the critics are reacting in USA, but in France they are vilifying this movie. So, whatever your American critics are saying, just do as usual : don't listen to them ! And enjoy this ninety-minutes show. Regarding Liam Neeson... Well, I am a huge fan, thus I can't be unbiased. Yet, I found his interpretation very convincing, he is still the same : one of the best actors ever, along with... Hum, I'll stop there, don't want to be controversial. Have a good sitting ! By the way, do excuse me for any mistake I could've made, as I'm French (I imagine you could've guessed it, since we are the lucky ones who are the first to be able to see this film !).",2008
8,"Since the entire plot of this film is given away in the masterfully delivered trailer, it's not divulging anything to say that Taken is a modern-day revenge thriller. This presents an interesting experiment, actually. Considering that there aren't really any surprises to be found in Taken, beyond those we were offered in the pre-release snippet, are splendidly realized action sequences enough to carry this film? The answer here is a resounding ""yes"". Taken may be a simple film, but it's not simplistic, and even though the first third of it is spent recapping what we knew going in, the second and third acts here deliver enough thrills and action to make this film riveting, even if we know exactly where it's going.",2009
8,"I went with very few expectations, despite being a fan of Neeson and Besson. I came out pleasantly surprised. The film is very much in the Bourne trilogy mold - Neeson's character is a been-there-seen-it-all former CIA agent who knows all the tricks and is also a dab hand at dispatching henchmen quickly and effectively.",2008
9,"This movie had me excited from since I had read reviews on IMDb about it, and it did not disappoint. This is a fast paced thriller that had me gripped till the end, with great elements of action, a bit of gore, a lot of suspense, and all in all a fun movie that was completely worth the 90 minutes.",2009
8,"Yes, its only an action movie; Yes, the script has more holes than the victims of the main character! Yes, Neeson's rampage in Paris is very implausible; Yes, its not Oscar material... no great acting.",2008

When I first saw this movie I knew that it was one of my favourite to date, there was never a dull moment, something was always happening at the acting was surprisingly good for a movie made to be the next big action thriller.",2014
9,I think this film is brilliant. I love it. It was interesting and enjoyable to watch from start to finish. The second Taken wasn't as good but this first one was a top film and the famous saying Liam says in the film is so cool and makes the character seem cooler.,2014

7,"Just watched this film and have to say, very good in the scheme of things. The film is quite slow at the beginning as others have said, however it quickly gathers pace. The way the script introduces you to the characters is excellent and its only when you see Liam Neeson tackling a crazed fan that you think he is an excellent choice in the lead role, in fact he carries it off very well. I wasn't too sure on Holly Valance as the pop singer, but as the number of scenes she is in are fairly minimal its OK. Action sequences are very well shot and you can tell Luc Besson had his hand in this. To this end, the overall film has an excellent pace which keeps you very well entertained. It has the same sort of storyline as Man on Fire so if you liked that film, then you will definitely like this. I would say its probably slightly better with the direction and cinematography being just a bit classier. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend you seeing this. 7/8 out of 10",2008
9,"Remember that time period when Hollywood used to release incredible action/thriller movies in an orderly pace? Neither do I. What used to be a great trend to participate in back in the 90s (Terminator 2, Speed, Face-Off, The Rock, Con Air, Die Hard: With a Vengeance, Jurassic Park, The Mummy, The Matrix, Bad Boys, Under Siege, True Lies, Desperado, Clear and Present Danger, The Hunt for Red October, Patriot Games, Saving Private Ryan, Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction) suddenly became a distant memory, as the 2000s served very few decent Hollywood thrillers. Instead, we have to head overseas to find them. The 2000s consisted of many surprise-surprise excellent European actioneers with Hot Fuzz, Run Lola Run, Transporter, Kiss of the Dragon, Unleashed, and this superb flick. ",2010
8,"As you all know I am very rarely wrong(note the sarcasm, lol), well this is one of those cases where I was extremely wrong. When I saw the trailer for the movie Taken, I thought ""Oh, great, another 'surprising and suspenseful' thriller that will I'm sure be the ending we never saw coming"", after all I've seen way too many of those movies. But after so many positive reviews of this movie I decided to go ahead and give it a fair shot. I adore Liam Neeson, but when I heard the role that he took as a deadly agent that you don't wanna mess with, I was in question. I tell you, this movie took me by complete and total surprise, this was a great movie. The story is something that we've seen a million times before, but what made this movie more special then the others are the fantastic performances and script that made this into an exciting and intense thriller.",2009

1,"To save you the time in either watching this film or reading my critique of it, here is a brief summary: This film is the worst film I have ever seen. This film is atrocious. This film is so unbelievably awful that all the writers, directors, producers and cast that worked on it should be sent to the Hague and tried for crimes against humanity.",2009
9,"Kate Winslet is just outstanding in this very interesting film that is almost two stories-in-one. The first part is a sexual story of an older woman having affairs with a teenage boy and the second part is her war crimes tale and what happens afterward. The first is a somewhat happy jaunt of a short story and the second is a very serious and depressing story. That's where Winslet really shines. Obviously, she's developed into an an outstanding actress.",2009

When it comes to the Holocaust, history's bleak, unsettling period, it doesn't matter what book you've read, film you've seen or account you've heard; in the end, your response it halted by its incomprehensible conclusion. How could humanity course its way towards such a violent, destructive path? How could people knowingly send men, women, and children to their impending doom? Most puzzling, how could the world allow it? Even though its been 63 years since the blood-drenched annals of World War II, its aftermath today is still bone chilling.",2009
10,"The film is a series of profound moral dilemmaswhile contrived by the author, they are fair questionsthat resonate deeply in the 21st Century: The role of guilt in victims, perpetrators, individuals and collectively, as well as justice, forgiveness, redemption, shame and, of course, literacy and its role in Western thought.",2009
10,"Very well acted and presented and a faithful representation of the main points of the novel on which it is based. This film encourages us to look closely at very difficult issues surrounding the atrocities of World War II. I am at a loss to understand why so many critics have been so damning of it. Perhaps it is too subtle for them to understand. It seeks to outlaw the false and intellectually lazy theory to explain the holocaust, namely that the horrors were committed by monsters. In its place we are offered contextualization, not as excuse but as explanation of how quite ordinary people were able to do extraordinarily dreadful things. We avoid these uncomfortable facts at our peril.",2009
10,"Kate Winslet, I absolutely adore her, she's my favorite actress of all time. I still can't believe that she hadn't won an Oscar, her first nomination was in 1995 with Sense and Sensibility. Finally after 14 long years, she finally won the coveted award with the movie The Reader. I finally was able to see this movie the other day and it blew me away, I'm still debating if this really was my favorite Kate Winslet performance, but once again with a strong cast telling a powerful story, The Reader was definitely one of the best films out of 2008. So many holocaust films have been made, it's hard to make another that stands out, but we really haven't had a story where the Nazi guards were on trial. A lot of people debate if this movie is trying too hard to push sympathy on Kate Winslet's character, but my love for this film is to just show that they were human as well, hard to believe, but that our mothers, sisters, friends, whoever could have done something so shameful.",2009
10,"Before I start reviewing, let me say something personal: As a German, one can hardly watch movies about the Holocaust, WWII or any related topic unbiased. As I have discovered myself, no German family is without a history related to the Third Reich, almost none are without grave guilt, or at least the fear thereof, and most who say otherwise either lie knowingly, or simply try to evade further inquiry. ",2010
10,The Reader is one of my favorite movies from the year 2008. It is incredibly complex in the way you react to the characters of the movie. It carries many emotions from sensuality to anger all the way back to that of sympathy and resolution. Many moves advertise themselves as unbiased and fair but nothing gets close to that like The Reader which is able to build sympathy for a character you would never think you could feel towards.,2009
9,"Like all works of art that endeavor to ""illuminate"" the Holocaust, ""The Reader"" ultimately finds itself looking for answers where none can be found. Yet, the beauty of the film is that it seems to acknowledge the impossibility of its task. Thus, rather than trying to resolve all the issues it raises, the movie simply lays them out before us, trusting that, in the final analysis, we will be able to come to our own conclusions about what, if anything, it all ""means.""",2009
9,"I read the book this movie is based on about 10 years ago, and as I watched the movie, it came back to me. I am not a Nazi sympathizer - very much NOT so - but at one point during the trials when Kate Winslet's character (Hanna) asks the judge, ""what would you have done"" kind of sums it up a lot. By reading the book beforehand, there is a lot more insight that perhaps the movie doesn't clearly give. From the beginning in the book it seems obvious that Hanna is illiterate and so later she on more apparent that she could never have possibly written the reports she was accused of. ",2009
9,"""The Reader"" isn't about the Holocaust, about Auschwitz, about German collective guilt or the guilt of complicit or evil individuals, even though it features a World War II war crimes trial. It is not about a love story, though there is a beautiful, sexy love story depicted in it. It is about the transformative power of art, in particular, in this case, literature. And literature, a teacher at one point in the film says, is centrally about the control of informationthe protecting, the withholding, the selective disclosing of information (whether by characters in the story or by its narrator). If we accept this thesis, literature is crucially about secrets, and ""The Reader"" is largely, primarily about the harm keeping secrets can do. When Michael (Ralph Fiennes) decides, after all, not to visit Hannah (Kate Winslet) during the trial he is observing as part of his training as a young law student, to press her to disclose to the court the information that would partially exculpate her from the worst, false accusation against herwhich could lessen her sentenceit is hard to figure. But it makes sense if we understand, as above, what the film is about, and see that he has decided to let her harm herself with her pridefully protected secret just as she so deeply hurt him by her refusal to admit the same secret to him. That's why he later doesn't write to her along with sending the tapes. Why, when he asks whether she thinks about the past, he doesn't mean their past, but her own guilty history. Why he is not more tender in that visit. In sending her the tapes, he thus clearly is not re-enacting a lover's tender mercies. He is offering her an avenue to her own richer partaking in the kind of exploration of human moral experience, questioning of choices and, ultimately, self-examination that literature presents opportunity for. And, one surmises, it worksadditionally prompted by the emotional distance evinced and moral query posed during his final visit to herwith the sad but perhaps just twist represented by her subsequent, final choice. He later unburdens himself to his daughter, as, earlier, the lifelong emotional distance he has held himself in in the protection of his own deep secret has earlier been revealed to have harmed her (among others, we must assume), and his relationships with her and them.",2009
10,"Stephen Daldry knows how to tell a story, knows how important it is to  make each of those characters relevant and indispensable, more  importantly, emotions are finely portrayed, but it is the cerebral  quality of his work that both impresses and irritates the audience.  Somehow, he let go of his control and made ""Billy Elliot"" exuberant and  glorious, with each note and emotion spilling out of the screen. His  restraint might have lessened the impact of the dark nature of the  tragedy in ""The Hours""; somehow the balance continues in ""The Reader"",  a powerful testament to the complexity of humans and their  interactions. In ""The Reader"" learning occurs, consequences, origins,  and motivations are carefully explored and analyzed, leaving out some  of the mystery for us to decide. Choice is key here, and some choices  are carry a bigger weight than others.  The marvelous Kate Winslet, who should be honoured for the quality of  her work, with as much recognition as it is humanly possible portrays  the central character of the story, a woman whose life might have been  shaped by unfortunate events, mostly undisclosed to us, and some of her  own genetic makeup. We, as the lawyers and the students in the film,  get to evaluate the evidence and choose to make a statement to justify  hers and our own ethical standpoints. It is the intricate and deft  interpretation of Hannah that anchors the story. Although, the story  follows Michael and their relationship from his teenage years to the  devastating conclusion, the film succeeds because Winslet is able to  show every bit of the confusion, rationale, and emotion that her  character possesses. She seems cold and detached, but as we look, we  discover that there is more to her than we can see from the moments we  see her on the screen. Hannah carries secrets inside her soul, somehow  keeping herself alive, surviving, living an austere existence that  hypnotizes, seduces, and repulses those she encounters.  Michael is seduced by this mysterious woman, and his own future is  shaped by those moments they spend together. What he doesn't realize is  how big of an effect their time together will have on his life. Their  early scenes are powerful and presented with a strong sense of realism  and brevity. They're probable the best of the film and might have to be  reviewed to understand how key they are to the further growth of  Michael's life and reactions to others. Winslet does not say much, but  her manipulations provoke her desired effects.  As their paths diverge and meet, their relationship changes as one  observes the dramatic turn of events that brings them together again,  and how Michael's actions have dire consequences for both of them. It  is during this period that we think we begin to see how relative  everything: what is moral and immoral, logic and emotional, simple and  complex. Highs and lows are hit again, as we become more involved in  one of the most powerful and dramatic moments of their lives.  In the final act of the film is when Winslet and Feines do some of  their most outstanding work ever; she even surpassing her masterful  turns in ""Revolutionary Road"", and ""Eternal Sunshine"". Every gesture,  every look, every enunciation add details and shed light to who they  were, are and might become. It is subtle work, haunting, and  bewitching, the work very few people are able to do.  ""The Reader"" reaches its amazing conclusion with a couple of scenes  that might break whatever little strength we might still have left.  ""The Reader"" isn't an important work, but it is a work that should be  recognized by the quality of its work, a finely tuned and produced  piece of cinema by people who recognize how magical, powerful, and  intelligent films can be.",2009
7,"This isn't meet-cute. Fifteen-year-old schoolboy Michael Berg (David Kross) first encounters his 36-year-old future lover Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet) by throwing up in her doorway. It's a dismal rainy day in a German city in 1958 and he has taken ill on the way home from school. She cleans him up and accompanies him to his family. He turns out to have scarlet fever, and is kept at home for months. Once he's well again he goes back carrying a bunch of flowers to thank Hanna for her kindness, but realizes he's turned on, and bolts in embarrassment while she's bathing. Eventually Michael returns and happily loses his virginity. A regular ritual of reading, bathing, and lovemaking develops between him and Hanna. He reads to her; she bathes him; the sex is mutual. She is a tram conductor with a harsh manner, and several huge secrets. She seems to be using Michael, but she's also enjoying him mightily, and he is reaping enormous rewards, though his affair puts pressure on his relations with family and schoolmates.",2008

We can't be certain how we got there or where we will be when everything settles but we do know that we are alive. Some experiences are life altering and we can run from them or embrace them. Staying to see them through though can bring incredible bliss but also tormented turmoil. We just never know. One such experience was had by a young Michael Berg (David Kross) and is chronicled in Stephen Daldry's THE READER. How could he know that when he pulled into an alley to be sick that he would meet the woman who would shape his entire life? How could he know that getting close to her would pull him the furthest he's ever been from himself?",2009
7,"David Hare wrote one of my favorite female characters in ""Plenty"", Meryl Streep brought her to life in the most extraordinary way. Here, Hare writes another power house female character. It doesn't have the intellectual aspirations of ""Plenty"" but there is also a form of mental illness in his character. Kate Winslet is magnificent. Her early scenes with the wonderful David Kross are filled with compelling, contradictory and totally believable undertones. My misgivings are to be pinned on Stephen Daldry, the director. His sins as a filmmaker start to become a sort of trade mark, visible and palpable in the moving ""Billy Elliot"" and the shattering ""The Hours"" I can't quite pinpoint what it is but in ""The Reader"" that element is more obvious than in the other two. Maybe it has to do with loftiness. There are moments so frustratingly long and slow here that he lost me in more than one occasion. In any case, the cast makes this film a rewarding experience. Besides Kate Winslet and David Kross. The tortured Ralph Finnes has a couple of wonderful moments as well as Bruno Ganz and Lina Olin in a dual role.",2008

Only another movie coming in mind called Monster's Balls.

8,"The Reader is off to a brilliant start with convincing characters,  superb acting and looming tragedy, but seems to lose its sure footing  as it heads toward a conclusion that feels partly carelessly planned  and mainly lacking direction. It decreases the most potent revelations  and resides on a powerful love that was successfully sustained only  during the beginning. Once again the order of events are jumbled on the  timeline and an unexpectedly long ending detracts from the impact of  the most poignant moments, not least of which is an undying love story  that overshadows the historical importance of the war crime trials that  set up a heartbreaking reunion.   In 1958 West Germany 15-year-old Michael Berg (David Kross) is escorted  home by a mysterious woman after becoming ill. Diagnosed with scarlet  fever and bedridden for three months, he eventually seeks out Hanna  (Kate Winslet) to thank her for her aid. Soon the two begin an unlikely  (and very graphic) affair that lasts the duration of the summer  Hanna  is distant and uncompassionate, but Michael finds himself hopelessly in  love (he insists on knowing her name by the third day they are  together). Before each sexual tryst Michael reads to Hanna  starting  with his school assignments; a German play, Homer's Odyssey,  Huckleberry Finn, The Lady with the Little Dog and eventually he even  reads comic strips.   One day Hanna vanishes, and Michael is left to return to school, study  law, and carry on relationships with people his own age. In 1966, while  attending a trial for German guard crimes against Jewish prisoners, he  spies Hanna as one of the defendants. Years later, torn between  remembering the great flame they shared and condemning her for her  crimes, Michael is haunted by the trial and determined to sort out his  feelings of guilt and love.   It's certainly a unique angle to show a sympathetic lead character  toward Holocaust involvement. As author Bernhard Schlink wrote about  his novel, on which the film is based, ""The Reader is not a story about  redemption or forgiveness. It is about how my generation of Germans  came to terms with what the generation before us had done."" He  challenges the viewer with transcending guilt, the ability to choose  love and the complexity of monstrous actions undertaken by ordinary  people. The film is splendidly emotional and comes very close to being  phenomenal. The drawn out conclusion is a meditation on the power of  love and its ability to overcome exceptionally trying junctures  and  even to overcome time itself. Morally devastating but not emotionally  involving enough to attain instant masterpiece status, The Reader still  boasts outstanding performances, a beautiful score and a moving tale of  complex affection.",2008
9,"It's not really difficult to be complimentary about this movie. Wonderful direction, quietly engrossing, great performances from all. Nice to see Bruno Ganz turning up too. There is something amazing about a film which successfully spreads itself across decades of people's lives, and this film is certainly successful in that respect. Really makes you think about the roles we play as humans. Are they really of our own making? How much power do we truly have in terms of being caught up something much, much bigger than one can even imagine? Probably the best thing that Ralph Fiennes has done in a while; Kate Winslet's star is obviously very much in the ascendancy these days, and I hope that we will be seeing a lot more of David Kross - a fine young actor.",2009
9,"In less than a decade,director Stephen Daldry has built a career composed by movies which have been highly acclaimed.Billy Elliot,The Hours and now The Reader,combine good manufacture with mature stories.I have to say I did not like Billy Elliot and The Hours very much because,although I appreciated those two elements I mentioned,I had found them too forced on their attempt at being commercial,not to mention I had also found them to be a little bit boring.I think that with The Reader,Daldry has made his best movie so far.At the difference of his previous films,The Reader never feels forced and I had a fascinating experience while watching it.Let's see why.The ""forbidden romance"",which pushes the conflict of this movie,is interesting but not particularly meaningful.The ideological background from the story is much more provocative,because it shows the causes and consequences of bad decisions which seemed appropriate on a moment.Many people have criticized The Reader because of its apparent apology of Nazi war criminals but I think they took the wrong focus.The Reader is not interested in analyzing their objective innocence or guilt,but on showing how a normal and reasonable person could commit atrocities during wartime,without being the amoral monster which immediately comes to our minds.That ideological and emotional audacity is the best element from this movie,because it results absolutely fascinating.Besides,the excellent performances from Kate Winslet and David Kross help to this movie.They are 100% natural on every scene they appear.Ralph Fiennes brings a competent performance,but this movie clearly rests on Winslet's and Kross' shoulders,whose extraordinary works are completely deserving of applause.Some people may complain about the slow tone from this movie,but I do not,because the parsimonious development is essential for showing the characters' evolution and for completely involving us into the movie.The only thing I can say against this brilliant movie is that the ending feels a little bit convenient and manipulative.But,in sight of all the positive elements this movie brings,I can excuse that fail.The Reader is an excellent film which deserves a very enthusiastic recommendation.I always admire when a movie wants to leave us thinking,and that's the main reason why I liked The Reader so much.",2009
7,"What is guilt? I believe this is the central question behind Stephen Daldry's new film The Reader. Based on the novel by Bernhard Schlink, the story asks its audience what a true monster is. If you know a secret, one that could exonerate someone from being found guilty of murder, should you help her even though you know she's accepted her guilt despite being unable to stop it? What if that person was someone you loved? There is some heavy material thrown about in the second half of this film, emotions run high and people must make decisions concerning some very dire situations. One thing is for sure, though, once that decision is made, no matter which side of the fence you fall on, some shred of guilt, some feeling of remorse, is inevitably going to follow you around for the rest of your life. This is what we call being human, because as Bruno Ganz's Professor Rohl says, ""our justice is governed by laws, not morals."" It doesn't matter whether something was right or wrong, it's whether it was legal or illegal. Unfortunately our souls don't work that way.",2009

The subject matter is much more than just an affair with an older woman, albeit this love affair impacts the young man throughout his life. It is more a morality play and a philosophical question of German guilt.",2009

10,"With his performance Eastwood shows you why people like himself, Jack Nicholson, or Paul Newman only come around once in a lifetime. Though Eastwood would rather focus on directing, he can still carry a movie with his on screen presence, and he's pure dynamite in ""Gran Torino"". Perhaps the poor box office results of ""hollywoody"" movies like Absolute Power, True Crime, Space Cowboys, and Blood Work, caused Eastwood to shy away from acting, but given cutting edge material to work with as ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""Gran Torino"", he's as good as ever. His character as the racist and salty war vet makes you think of that old guy we've all had on our blocks with the garbage door open, the million tools hanging everywhere, and always fixing or building something. I found myself not wanting the movie to end because the scenes between himself and the various Hmong characters where priceless. There may be complaints over the racist remarks and scenes, but Eastwood pulls it off in a way a real person like that would talk or act to a point where it ends up being lighthearted. I'm not going to give the plot away, but if you like your Clint Eastwood as a hard-nosed tough guy with foul language alla Dirty Harry or Heartbreak Ridge, you'll love this movie!!",2008
10,"I saw the film and it was unbelievable. Clint Eastwood will have you laughing so hard you almost pee yourself while at the same time breaking your heart and making you want to cry. The movie takes you on a roller-coaster ride and the entire theater stood up in applause afterward. I highly recommend this film and if Eastwood doesn't get nominated for an Oscar something is truly wrong!!! The screening I saw was held at the Writer's Guild, so the room was filled with SAG, WGA, DGA, and other industry related people who I would wage know their movies. At points the entire room was laughing so loud I couldn't hear, and then minutes later all you could hear were the sniffles from people crying. The film has drama, comedy, and action and Clint Eastwood really creates a character that you care about and cheer for...again!",2008

10,"Manohla Dargis writes in the New York Times: ""Dirty Harry is back, in a way, in ""Gran Torino,"" not as a character but as a ghostly presence. He hovers in the film, in its themes and high-caliber imagery, and of course most obviously in Mr. Eastwood's face. It is a monumental face now, so puckered and pleated that it no longer looks merely weathered, as it has for decades, but seems closer to petrified wood. Words like flinty and steely come to mind, adjectives that Mr. Eastwood ... expressively embodies with his usual lack of fuss and a number of growls."" More praise for Eastwood comes from Joe Morgenstern in the Wall Street Journal, who comments: ""No one makes movies like Gran Torino any more, and more's the pity. This one, with Clint Eastwood as director and star, is concerned with honor and atonement, with rough justice and the family of man. It raises irascibility to the level of folk art, takes unapologetic time-outs for unfashionable moral debates, revives acting conventions that haven't been in fashion for half a century and keeps you watching every frame as Mr. Eastwood snarls, glowers, mutters, growls and grins his way through the performance of a lifetime."" Elizabeth Weitzman in the New York Daily News remarks that ""it's clearly a career-capping work."" Kenneth Turan in The Los Angeles Times writes that the movie ""is impossible to imagine without the actor in the title role. The notion of a 78-year-old action hero may sound like a contradiction in terms, but Eastwood brings it off, even if his toughness is as much verbal as physical. Even at 78, Eastwood can make 'Get off my lawn' sound as menacing as 'Make my day,' and when he says 'I blow a hole in your face and sleep like a baby,' he sounds as if he means it.""",2008
9,seeing the trailer for this film kinda made me expect id be watching Dirty Harry in the suburbs.,2008
10,"This is a poignant, beautiful movie, maybe the best film Eastwood has ever done. The characters are fully drawn, believable, and resonate true human emotion. I at first was put off by the idea of seeing a movie about an old racist, but when I saw the numbers of people attending the screenings, I thought there must be something there, so I went to the Arclight in Hollywood, where the theater was packed. Crusty old Kowalski, a Korean war veteran, now living in run down Detroit, hates the Vietnamese immigrants that have moved next door to him. As time goes on, he gets to know them, and the bond that forms is wonderful, and spiritual. There was not a dry eye in the house when the movie ended. I won't give the ending away, but suffice it to say this is a truly wonderful story, one that you will love and tell your friends to see. If you're looking for one of those great movie experiences that so rarely comes along, you'll not find a better film to see than this.",2008
7,"Although I am a big fan of Eastwood and have enjoyed most of his films, I found Gran Torino to be overly sentimental and I'm confused by the high IMDb rating. The plot thread is almost banal - why would the tough Asian gang devote so much effort in pursuit of the teenage boy who did not want to be a member? and lacked credibility - the sick old man was able to intimidate these gang members? and is too familiar - hardened racist comes around, honorable man sacrifices his life for justice and absolves himself of past sins through his last actions on earth, etc., etc. And I disagree with the comment that viewers were permitted to 'make up our own minds'. In this film, the moral of the story was in the viewer's face and an emotional response was overtly solicited. Compared to Unforgiven, a film that was both powerful and subtle, and avoided obvious moral judgments, Gran Torino is an amateurish piece.",2009
8,"Hot on the heels of 'Changeling' Eastwood is back and as well as directing he is back in front of the camera. He plays Walt Kowalski a recently widowed ex-Vietnam veteran who harbours slight racism and bitterness which isn't helped by the changing world he now lives in alone. He has relatives but they only seem to call when they want something and his grandkids have already started deciding what they will have of his when he dies. He has a few mates he drinks with in the pub but other than that his neighbourhood is being overrun by immigrants and gang warfare. Walt's next door neighbours are a Hmong family with no father figure and after the son tries to steal his prize car, the 'Grand Torino' of the title, Walt decides to try and reform the boy and hopefully as time passes learn about their culture and change his mind before he dies. As with all Eastwood films where you begin isn't where you will end up and the story takes many turns that will test all of your emotions, I laughed, I cried and I got angry it's a real roller-coaster. But its Clint's aged 'Dirty Harry' in Walt that steals the show and anytime he is on screen he is mesmerising which means that the supporting cast members are barely noticeable. At times it plays like Lynch's 'Straight Story' with sprinkles of 'Taxi Driver' but the real beauty is in the old fashioned storytelling, something that Clint is a dab hand at, mix that with the modern day context and you have a gripping and enthralling film. It's no wonder that so many 'best of year' lists contain this film, they should, it is that good and it proves that even at 78 Eastwood is a force to be reckoned with when it comes to movies in front or behind the camera or in the case of 'Grand Torino' both.",2008
9,"I saw Gran Torino opening weekend and after hearing rave reviews, I was looking forward to it. After seeing it, I realized what people were excited about, it was Clint's performance, this is a man you do not want to mess with. He's the perfect good guy with a bad guy's lust for vengeance. I love his growls, he sounds like a great guard dog, I would love to just have him by my door if a salesman comes by to make that noise. I can't believe what a triple threat Clint is: he's a writer, director, and an actor, not to mention that he's great at all three of them. He presents Gran Torino with grace and style of an old man that society has forgotten about because of his bad mood not realizing that deep down, he's truly a good man.",2009
9,"This movie made me laugh and cry at the same time. It deals with both grimy old bastards as well as with more serious matters as racism. Good acting from Clind as well as all his supporting actors and once again Clint has shown that he is capable of making movies that involves both emotions and stereotypes! The ""olidish"" bitterness of Clint's character and the mix between comedy and drama is just genius. The only criticism of the movie would be that the gang-bangers were pretty and does not correspond very well to all of the reports of gang violence all around the world. But overall I thought this was a great movie with lots of potential for being one of those films that you will actually remember when you visit the video rental store in five years from now.",2008
9,"If movies like Indiana Jones, Iron Man and The Dark Knight were the thoroughbred hits of 2008, then Clint Eastwood's Gran Torino is the dark horse.

5,"I'm from the industrial Midwest, and I've known a lot of Walt Kowalskis. Grizzled, white ethnic old-timers who are not PC, whose cars are their first love, and who bemoan the loss of ""their"" neighborhoods, and ""their"" city. I've also known a fair number of kids like Thao, Hmong-American kids trying to make it in a world their parents do not understand. I've known neighborhoods like Walt's: neighborhoods in transition that show signs of decay, but are still lived in and tended to by hard working old timers like Walt and their hard-working immigrant neighbors, whom they don't understand and paint with a broad brush as ""the other."" I was excited to watch Gran Torino because of the rave reviews and its portrayal of this world of which I am so familiar. Sadly, while I appreciated the premise, and was happy to see so many Hmong actors in Hmong roles (rather than ""professional"" non-Hmong Asian actors playing these roles), the movie came up short. I found the dialogue and characters to lack credibility, and the plot too cliché-ridden to be taken seriously. ",2009

5,"I saw this film a couple of days ago. Clint Eastwood does (as always) an amazing job on the screen. Sadly he is also almost the only one with a major part doing a good job. Most of the conversations are awkward and very stiff. I actually had to turn away a few times because the situation became so very embarrassing. Sadly, Clint Eastwood is the only one on screen that keeps you from not walking away from it. Bee Wang and Ahney Her ,who are both totally unknown to me, both have major parts in this film. They are both doing among the worst acting jobs ever and should take acting classes before going on screen with one of the greatest. The story line does not come with any surprises, and you can pretty much figure out most of the twists and turns as the film goes on.",2009
3,"This movie has so many problems that I'm not sure where to begin. So i'll simply mention things as they come to be, rather than in chronological order. The first thing that has to go from this film is the awful scene at the barbershop where Clint is trying to teach Thao how to interact with people. Awful, awful, awful, and it goes on and on, and then it ends with the lamest joke about anal sex with some carpenters. Actually, all the barbershop scenes can go, because the only thing they accomplish is to show that Clint's character makes racist remarks even with his friends. But we get that from the scene with the Irish foreman. The priest should have been recast. That said, the scene near the end when the priest just walks right into Clint's house is terrible. The whole movie the priest has been calling Clint's character by his first name, and Clint keeps correcting him, asking to be called Mr. Kowalski, and then predictably in this late scene the priest calls him Mr. Kowalski, and Clint says, ""Call me Walt."" Awful. And nothing is accomplished in the scene anyway. The editing is poor also. Scenes that have ended continue for a few more moments. For example, the scene where Sue is being hassled by three black guys is over once Clint gets her into his truck and they drive away. But the scene continues with a crane shot of the three guys walking away and talking about Clint. What do we care what these guys think of him? The scene is over, move on. Okay, now for some real spoilers... The end is completely retarded. Clint's character should not die that way. After all, his standing up to the gang earlier should have empowered the neighborhood to take a stand. They should have reported the names of the guys who raped and beat Sue. Instead, Clint goes on a suicide mission, somehow knowing that only then would people tell the police what's been going on. Someone says, ""This time there were witnesses."" Well, hell, there were witnesses every time, but no one was willing to speak up. Why should they now? It's ridiculous. And then of course the kid inherits the stupid car. Who cares? What he should have inherited was the tools. The tools are what really brought those two characters together; the tools are what will be useful to him in allowing him to get on with his life. The movie is plagued by some of the worst acting i've ever seen in a film. The bit where Thao is locked in Clint's basement and he's demanding to be let out had the whole audience laughing, and it was supposed to be a serious moment. I don't understand why people love this film. My only guess is that the vast majority of film-goers are morons. Oh well.",2009

3,"Eastwood has shown us many times before he understands the art of movie-making. That's why it's so confusing to see he was able to make such an embarrassing, almost amateuristic movie. Yes, in the beginning of the movie some of the over the top grumpy, racist, cynical one-liners are quite amusing, but then it just turns into an embarrassing spectacle of bad acting, bad writing, bad editing, just bad movie-making. The acting of the girl, and especially the boy next door are just gutwrenching to watch. My head was spinning by such a display of amateurism. I try to understand how on earth they could have ended up in an Eastwood movie. Are they his adopted children or children of friends or something? For sure he's doing somebody a huge favor to include them in the movie. Some of the scenes are really beyond bad. What's up with him connecting with the Asian kids by fixing the washing machine in the basement? The whole idea of the scene is stupid and embarrassing, let alone the execution of it. And than the scene when they are waiting for the girl, not sure what happened to her. Eastwood stares at his hand saying (something like) ""at least in Korea we were expecting to loose one of us"".... Can it get more cheesy than that? I didn't know whether I should laugh or cry. And than the scenes with the barber. The initial idea works out well and amusing - the barber and Eastwood doing their grumpy routine. But than they try and milk the idea and even introduce the boy (deprived of all acting skills) into their 'domain of real men' to teach him the way of Men (to curse). It just gets so embarrassing, you just want to leave the theater and get drunk to simply destroy the brain cells that stored the whole thing, to save you from uncomfortable flashbacks for the rest of your life. Let's just hope mr. Eastwood had a blackout, let's just hope his sense of quality returns and let's hope the majority of IMDb-ers grow a sense of quality so 'movies' like this don't end up in the top 100 of all time again.",2009
1,"Clint should never have gotten behind the camera for this one, much less back in front of it. It's been stated over and over about how clichéd this movie is, and that's probably its strongest point. It's downhill after that. The acting-- Clint's in particular-- is dreadful. I applaud the use of Hmong character's, but they should also be able to perform. Nope. The worst part of this film, for me, is that it is supposed to be ""courageous""-- so white-boy Clint spews as many slurs as he can, scattergunning epithets for every ethnic group he can come up with-- but dare not whisper the ""N"" word--even in a potentially ""appropriate"" scene-- which makes him totally unbelievable. If he was at all true to his character it would have popped out of his mouth smoother than ""zipperhead"", as living in Detroit would've afforded ample opportunity to hone that facet of his racism. His disdain for Asians had over 50 years to get rusty before the new neighbors showed up.",2011
4,"The 4 stars are solely for Eastwood's performance, which was top notch as usual. He is like a fine wine, he only gets better.... As for the rest of the movie, a couple of other reviewers have nailed it, but the multitude of people that gave it anywhere from 9 to 10 stars saw a different movie from me. The rest of the acting in the movie is honestly the worst I can remember seeing in a movie. There are times when there is maybe one actor in a movie who is not very polished, but in this movie, there are actor after actor, scene after scene, where aside, from Clint, I thought I was watching a middle school production. And it wasn't ONLY the acting. The dialogue for a large part of the movie was also very forced, unrealistic, and staged. Not great writing here folks. There are a few rewarding moments, and again, Clint's acting and character are superb, but that is not enough to recommend this amateurish, predictable, and pretty unrealistic movie.",2009

I just couldn't stop laughing throughout this film, who knew that Sean William Scott could actually be really funny? I know there are a lot of Stiffler fans that will hate that sentence, but I don't remember a time that I laughed so hard at his character.

While Wheeler is landed with Ronny an obnoxious little 10 year old, Danny is landed with a dungeons and dragon playing geek called Augie. While neither of them hit it off with the kids at first they all eventually become friends and learn a lot of life lessons. Ahhhh! ",2009
10,"I saw this movie at a free screening last night, and by the time the movie was over, I was hoarse because I laughed so much. And these weren't just little laughs, but big guffaws. The whole audience was laughing through the whole movie. The previews are funny, but this is one instance where they don't show the only funny parts of the movie in the previews. Paul Rudd is a great actor, in general, and he really shines in this movie. The movie is hysterical, raunchy, and touching. Kudos to Rudd, Wain, and Merino. I really hope that this movie gains a lot of ground through the great buzz it is currently getting. It deserves that buzz.",2008
9,"For every twenty filthy disgusting R-rated comedy gems, there's one that stands out because of its heavy dosage of heart. Role Models isn't the sort of movie you'd expect to be the exception, but nonetheless delivers quality film-making, quality writing and acting, and plenty of life-lessons as well as raunchy humor to keep you laughing throughout. Paul Rudd's first script is full of his dry, sarcastic, witty brand of humor; and then we have the hilarious Seann William Scott in the sidekick role. Underneath the layers of profanity, sex jokes, cleavage lies life values and a hidden layer of sentimentality that seeps its way through the second and third acts. The transition is very slow and gradually actually improves the film as it rolls on.",2009
8,"Just saw this tonight at an advance screening. It was very funny, and warm hearted. I suppose the humor is often crude, but, hey. The natural dialog reminded me of Superbad and 40 Year Old Virgin. Paul Rudd has developed a deadpan style of improvisational humor that seems to work better and better the more movies he makes. Christopher Mintz-Plasse from Superbad and Robb'e J. Johnson are excellent as the kids. Jane Lynch brings her signature brand of demented free association to the role of the charity-addicted leader of a kids charity. If you liked Superbad, Pineapple Express and 40 Year Old Virgin, go! If you didn't; Dude, like, don't!",2008
9,"As a comedy this movie delivers. I review movies for my part time job and after seeing 10+ movies a week, you get pretty numb to most of the stuff out there. This is one of the few comedies I've laughed out loud at in a while. There are lots of funny scenes throughout that kept me laughing the entire movie, instead of most comedies that just have lots of hit and miss scenes. This is up there Adam McKay's stuff, and better than most Happy Madison films.",2009
10,"Move over Superbad and Knocked Up. The guys from The State, The Ten, and Wet Hot American Summer have outdone themselves tenfold. I saw a preview screening a little less than a month ago, going in with no expectations. Paul Rudd's never written a movie before, but I enjoy Ken Marino and David Wain's work so I knew it would at least be amusing. Wow was I wrong. From start to finish, every line was perfectly written with perfect delivery from Rudd and company.",2008

9,"The capsule summary of ""Role Models"" on Xfinity TV is, ""Forced to join a mentorship program, two irresponsible men (Seann William Scott, Paul Rudd) must help a pair of impressionable boys navigate the troubled waters of youth.""

8,"Paul Rudd and Seann William Scott are two very funny comedic actors. They prove what great chemistry they have together. Rudd and Scott star as Danny and Wheeler, two ne'er-do-wells who are sentenced to do community service. They have to serve in a Big-Brother-type program called Sturdy Wings for a total of 150 hours. Danny and Wheeler have opposite attitudes, yet they get along like they have been best friends for years. Jane Lynch (The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Talladega Nights) steals the show as the supervisor of the program that Danny and Wheeler are enrolled in. Elizabeth Banks gives a good supporting turn as Danny's girlfriend and lawyer. Another show stealer is Bobb'e J. Thompson as Ronnie, the kid Wheeler has to be a big brother to. Thompson is given some of the funniest lines and he is believable in this role.",2010
10,"I was at a screening of this movie tonight and I have to say that it is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. I didn't have any expectations going into and actually thought it might just be an average comedy, but I was way wrong. All the actors fit their parts very well and the story flowed pretty well too. There are definitely some surprise moments that will have you busting up.",2008
9,"I was at the first screening of this movie and I was so pleasantly surprised! I like both Paul Rudd and Stiffler but they were at their best in this. It's about time someone wrote a movie that allowed Rudd to be the sarcastic prick he can be and have him be more then the guy that steals all the scenes he's in. And Shawn William Scott is very funny playing a ""stiffler"" type of character with a soft spot. It was good to see McLovin in another movie but he was only OK playing the nerdy kid that knows he's nerdy. I loved him as the nerdy kid that thought he was cool. I'd rather laugh at him then feel sorry for him. Oh, And I agree this movie needs to be rated R. Nothing is funnier then kids cursing. I'll probably pay to see it a second time, hopefully they don't edit it to death.",2008
1,"This was terrible. It teaches some of the worst lessons I have ever seen. For example, standing up the the Laire king is shown as wrong, but humbling oneself to him is seen as the right and noble thing. BS. The eventual battle at the end does nothing to make up for this. The black kid in the movie curses at everyone and slaps one of the main characters, with no censure by his mother other than ""watch your mouth"" and they put up with it why...? His mother should have taken him across her lap. (In fact, cursing in front of kids is rampant in this movie.) This movie seems like its completely conflicted: it has one undercurrent of by being unbelievably politically correct, and another of trying to violate every decency.",2009
8,"I hear a lot of bad things about Paul Rudd, and I hear (and say my fair share of) bad things about Sean William Scott. This movie works perfectly for both of them. Their characters are both funny, but not over-the-top or just stupid. Actually, they are stupid on one level, but the kind of stupid we enjoy, the kind we can relate to more. They say what comes to their mind with little regard to who is listening. This makes them potentially the worst role models in history. That is the main premise of this film. These two guys have to do community service time after one of them goes a little overboard while advertising one of those Monster-esque sports drinks. They have to watch/guide two kids, or go to prison. One of our kids is a Fantasy dork; but when you see the fantasy world he gets to inhabit; it looks like fun. The other is one of the funniest kids I've ever seen. He swears like one of the kids from Superbad, and everything he says is pure comedy gold. He's like a 7 year old Martin Lawrence with the material of Dave Chapelle. The guys have problems and issues through the nose and the less maturity than most of the kids, but as the kids start to open up to them, they open up as well. It isn't the typical ""I know how you must be feeling"" stuff either. It is more like how people actually meet and make relationships, and entertaining besides. Hope you like Sex and Rock and Roll. As for the supporting actors/characters; they are all hilarious as well. Jane Lynch is hilarious as the head of the community service center, ""ideal"" role model Gary is perfect for making us see these two morons in a better light, and Ken Jeong is perfect as the King of the Realm (watch the movie for full understanding). All together, it's crude, but it's funny. It's absolutely worth watching if you like to laugh. I don't recommend bringing your kids, though.",2011
7,"I need to look into the plethora of comedies coming down the pipe for who wrote and directed them. I watched the trailer for Role Models and thought it looked funny enough. But it was Seann William Scottdon't get me wrong, he's pretty good, I just didn't have it high on my list, even though my boy Paul Rudd co-starred. So, here I was, months later and finally ready to take a peek, and the starting credits just made me excited for what was to follow. I had no idea that the crew behind ""The State"" were integral in the production, both writing and starring. Whether my memory of that show holds up to its actually enjoyment, I don't know, however, what they have been doing lately has been comic genius. Even in the more subtle collaborations like Diggers, the laughs were big and the comedy worthwhile. Thankfully, director David Wain and co-writer Ken Marino brought the star of that film over, Rudd, to help them once again. The guy is pure gold these days and even though this new film is pretty run-of-the-mill story-wise, the characters and antics are anything but.",2009

4,"Make up your own mind. Personally I found it as much fun as receiving a spinal tap from Stevie Wonder. No offense Mr. Wonder. Maybe it is comedy, but I just found it stupid. Not exactly the first two choices to babysit your kids; Wheeler(Seann William Scott)and Danny(Paul Rudd),two energy drink salesmen, to avert jail time are court ordered to mentor two kids from a development center run by Gayle Sweeny(Jane Lynch). One of the misfits is Ronnie(Bobb'e J. Thompson), a foul-mouthed fifth grader and the other is Augie(Christopher Mintz-Plasse), a bashful young man that roll plays in a fantasy medieval world. Wheeler and Danny desperately try to give their charges an invaluable inside view of life, love and heavy metal. Lynch is hilarious with her dry wit analogies. Supporting are: Elizabeth Banks, Ken Jeongg, Kerri Kenney-Silver, Amanda Righetti and David Wain.",2009
3,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, but I'm sad to report that it was disappointing. How some people can call this one of the best comedies of '08 is beyond me. There's a few funny moments, nothing more. Doesn't even come close to ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", ""Knocked Up"" or even ""Step Brothers"". ",2009
1,"Firstly, I LOVE Sean William Scott in American Pie. THAT is funny, quite surprisingly considering it's premise.Each sequel was equally funny and if anything an improvement on the previous. Ultimately the original American Pie series were very funny and broke ground away from previous mediocre teen sex comedies by treating sex unexpectedly maturely - rather like the 40 Year Old Virgin..",2009
6,"This movie definitely does not push any new boundaries in the film industry. Role Models uses sex and cursing to make a few cheap jokes running through most of the movie. Yet, it uses well-timed jokes to generate a few laughs here and there that made the movie worth watching if you do not get too offended at seeing some breasts or hearing the constant use of profanity. This type of movie is definitely well received in the culture of young people, and I am guessing it won't become old anytime soon with young moviegoers. The movie speaks to the need for adults to invest in the lives of hurting kids who are lacking the traditional family unit. Studies show that kids who have a relationship with a caring non-family member usually are healthier. Sean William Scott and Paul Rudd's characters are not your typical role models who kids necessarily should emulate. Yet, through the chaos of the movie the two characters actually make a positive impact in the lives of the students and their families. Part of me wants to say that only in the movie world could characters with lives as crazy as these actually be fit to be an actual role model. One could wonder at what point does somebody actually qualify to invest his or her life in others. Maybe, the first act of selflessness portrayed in the movie is the crossing line one can actually be a role model. Is it too crazy to think that any of us can let go of our self-absorption and invest time into others?",2008
8,I watched step brothers yesterday for the second time after purchasing it on DVD. For me this is always the tough test when it comes to comedy.

If you want to call it a film. Get a hand-held camera, cruise to just about any neighborhood in the country, find the two stupidest guys in that neighborhood, write a retarded screenplay in about an hour and a half and go for it. Then take what you slapped together over to some gullible Hollywood executives and offer to sell it to them for as much money as you can squeeze out of them. As far as I'm concerned if they're dumb enough to fork over millions for something any idiot can dream up then by all means take as much as you can get.",2012
7,"There's a difference between Step Brothers and Baby Mama. Step Brothers is not up to par with the best work of the Will Ferrell-Adam McKay writing team, but it is not like Baby Mama in the sense that it has made me lost faith in the brand. Many critics seem to not know the difference. Bob Hope and Bing Crosby made 7 films together. Would critics have given this film a bigger pass if Will Ferrell and John C Reiley's film were called Talladega Nights II? What I'm getting it is I thought this film was plenty funny and certainly inventive enough. In fact, I stayed in the theater and watched it twice. The big stars of the film are not John C Reilly and Will Ferrell but Mary Steenburgen and Richard Jenkins for holding down straight faces and being convincing as a loving dad and a loving mom of such silly characters. You could insert the characters played by Jenkins and Steenburgen into something like Cheaper by the Dozen or Gilmore Girls and it would still pretty much work.",2008
1,"This movie is worse than Disaster Movie a worthy Candidate for the worst comedy made within the past 5 years. The plot is about these losers who still live at home, unemployed 40-year-olds who live with their mother and father they meet and they develop a relationship and get married Ferrel and Reilly hate each other and Ferrel does the worst thing in any comedy movie (besides Charlies Angels 2 with hiring those writers(even though writers isn't a word to describe them) he puts his balls on Reilly's drum set (no wonder earlier in this piece of crap he said ""Don't touch my drum set"") and then they find out they have more in common and they decide to start a new music band (REPLACE THE DRUM SET) and then Ferrels younger brother is in town this guy is a success with a love relationship Ferrel says he's an ###hole and the brother sells their house and they try to get it back by doing the unthinkable like dressing up as Natzi's and putting makeup on Ferrel's face trying to make out he's dead (if only it was real) and later Ferrel's younger brother runs out of people to sell it to and one night they release their first music video see they wanted to be in this band with 2 people the step-brothers and Reilly's father owns a boat and that's where they were filming it while it was in the water with nobody driving it. it hits a cliff not knowing what they did they made their parents break up the brothers cry now this is THE WORST CRYING I HAVE EVER SEEN and I have seen Muriel's Wedding and that scene in Charlies Angels 2 where Drew Barrymore thinks her friends have died the mother says it's not their fault but the father snaps some logic in them and say it is their fault and anyway Ferrel bury's John C Reilly alive and how he got past the broken up parents I don't know and Reilly gets out and they decide to grow up (they decide to stop acting like overgrown 4-year-olds and get a life) and Ferrel works with his brother and he does some festival or some crap and Reilly's the chef and the band doesn't show up so what does the father do he says go and act like overgrown 4-year-olds and do that band and Ferrel's voice changes everything in the movie (except thee quality) and the younger brother who his co-workers chant something extremely disturbing until that voice came on he decides to make peace with the brother so the movie changes from some 40-year-old losers acting like 4-year-olds to a gay finale like in High School Musical and Hairspray oh and Ferrel entered Therapy earlier in the movie and that stupid voice made the therapist in love with him but we change from a Gay finale to Ferrel and Reilly beating the crap out of little kids who earlier in the movie forced them to lick dog crap which I don't want to know how it became white. all in all the worst comedy I have seen since Charlies Angels 2 or Muriels Wedding",2009

7,"I never in my wildest dreams thought I'd ever utter these words about a Will Ferrell vehicle, especially one with Adam McKay as collaboratorbesides that Pearl video The Landlord on the internet last yearbut here it is. Step Brothers is an absolutely hilarious film. From end to end, I don't remember the last time I've laughed this hard, without stop. This is what Ferrell needs to do, no more of those bio-spoofs of idiots that fall flat due to their tired joke. He is unstoppable as a part of an ensemble when he doesn't have to be the center of attention for an hour and half. The guy is obnoxious, and while funny, the more freedom he gets, the more annoying he is. Having a guy like John C. Reilly to play off of helps rein him in and give the audience a break, allowing the jokes to breath and not become stifled by the monotony of his schtick. Like Old School before it, Ferrell kills in smaller doses. He has shown me that ability again here and whereas I won't even keep Anchorman or Talladega Nights on screen when flipping through the television, I seriously can't wait to revisit this one again.",2008
1,"There are movies that are really bad, but are so bad they are actually good, thus watchable. B-movies from the 50s come to mind. Then there are silly movies with some chuckles along the way. Then there are stupid movies, and some are still okay, as there are some chuckles along the way and likable characters. Then there's Step Brothers. What the rating system needs is a zero or negative numbers as this movie does not even rate a zero. The group that was watching this flick were all Ferrell and Reilly fans, but after 20 minutes most had left the room. I'll have to admit that no one stayed to watch the entire flick, even the most die-hard Ferrell fan, so this review is only based on what was watched. And even then it was painful. What were Jenkins and Steenburgen thinking when they decided to be in this movie? Both are fine actors, and if not for them this flick would have been turned off sooner. But then, this movie is not about them, but 2 middle-aged men who have been coddled by their parents and not only still live at home, are waited on hand and foot. No one liked Ferrell or Reilly's characters at all and we had no idea what this movie was trying to prove. Maybe there's a point near the end. That's if you can stand to waste your time waiting for it. Our guess is that everyone learns to live peacefully with one another. Our suggestion, your time would be better spent cleaning your bathroom.",2009

Many critics commented on how well they did given what they had to work with, but I think the script was excellent. Some of the lines were brilliant, but you really have to give the actors credit for improvising. After Ferrell revealed his singing talents when he sang ""Let's Give 'Em Something to Talk About"", when Reilly gushed on and on about how great he was, and then said ""I'm not sure, but towards the end I think I saw you turn into a Unicorn"", I lost it. I really lost it when Ferrell's brother & his family were singing in the car ""Sweet Child of Mine"". It was a real classic.",2008

It is degrading to the intelligence of anyone who actually condescends to watching it, it offers nothing of worth in any category and it loses itself in a festering ball of pathetic, sorry ass-felching crap that I would rather have a root canal than watch again. It's about two thirty or forty year old guys who live with their single parents. When the parents end up meeting at a business conference of sorts, the two men are forced to try and get along.

Other than always dependable character actor Richard Jenkins as the dad, I have never seen worse acting in a major motion picture.

I can't imagine what this turkey must have been like to sit through in a theater.

The highly sophisticated and charming Will Ferrell teams up with dashing John C. Reilly as they deliver us a trip down a level of integrity rarely ever seen in movie-making. The result is a comedy so low in the intelligence scale, it doesn't require anything past a 2nd grade education to truly appreciate what a show they've put on.",2009
1,"This movie will suck the intelligence out of you. I just cannot believe that any grown up actor would want to be part of this pile of manure. What on earth were they thinking? It has no redeeming features at all. It suffers from an unbelievable story and even more unbelievable characters. It is a sorry state of affairs when people who are interested in movies (they must be if they are part of IMDb) can say this rubbish is the best comedy they have ever seen. How dumb can you be? I feel really dumb myself because I keep trying to watch Will Ferrell comedy movies-I should know better because there is not one I could say I really liked. The only decent film I have seen him in was Stranger than Fiction. He seems to repeat himself over and over in each movie, none of them with any idea what comedy is. Avoid this, and anything with Ferrell in it, like the plague. You will be less intelligent after watching this crap. If this is the sort of thing that makes you laugh then you are beyond sad. It is witless, dull and without any kind of merit. I was horrified to see that Mary Steenburgen would lend her talents to this pile of ordure. It is though it was written by 15 years olds but not performed as well as 15 year olds would manage. Will Ferrell is his usual lame self and John C Reilly must have felt like he was dying inside - he is so much better than this. To think that an adult would read this script and think that it was worth doing is beyond my comprehension. Everyone involved should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves. It seems to me that anything with Judd Apatow attached to it will be of this sort of quality, likewise Will Ferrell.",2011
8,"Okay, I feel like you have to judge this show with a grain of salt. I've actually found it very enjoyable and oddly addictive, though that doesn't mean I think it's good. Yes, there are plot holes, character inconsistencies, cheesy dialogue, etc., but I think because it doesn't take itself too seriously (like, for example, Robin Hood was prone to do) it can get away with most of these things. There are moments of genuine comedy that I really appreciate, and the rest of the time I spend giggling at the aforementioned flaws. I think the cast is quite good as well: Colin Morgan is charmingly dorky as the title character; Anthony Head milks a surprising amount of emotion from a ridiculously poorly written character; and the rest (except perhaps for Katie McGrath, who can be a little too emotional) imbue their roles with genuine humanity. I especially like the growing relationship between Merlin and Arthur-- the way the show is written, Merlin's only reason for helping Arthur is that 'it's his destiny,' and Arthur has no real reason at all to help Merlin, and yet you definitely feel that they are starting to care for each other.",2008

Add to the mix some romantic plot lines that never quite seem to materialize and the constant fret of fiends and enemies to the kingdom, occasionally intertwined with some harsh prophecy and the result is a 5 star exciting, fun adventure.",2008

The cast is excellent - although when it started one wanted to see the traditional story of Arthur and Excalibur and Lancelot unfold, the sheer chemistry of the current cast are so enjoyable, that I now dread the demise of King Uther, as Anthony Head is absolutely compelling in this role - by far the best thing I've ever seen him do. Merlin, Arthur, even Richard Wilson as Gaius against all the odds, are all brilliantly cast and played.",2008

9,"I would love to see more than one season devoted to this masterpiece of a TV series. Each episode gets better and better. It's obvious the writing is great and the scripts are masterpieces. Keep up the great work. Certainly looking forward to the next episode where Lancelot is brought in to the storyline. Great cast too. I too note Merlin and Arthur are becoming closer to each other on a friendship basis. The show has a lot of good emotion in it. Good action and that right touch of keeping you on the edge, like what is going to happen next. I really like that. Just like Robin Hood, keeps you on the edge. Another great television series.",2008
7,"I liked this entire series with the exception of the fact that they never kill Morgana. After getting knocked out tons of times they let her live. They could just go and chop her head off. And then the white dragon who merlin the dragon lord hatched and named takes Morganas side. There are so many episodes that frustrate me because of bad writing and things that did not make sense, this is more in the last season but also in others. overall its good show. I like many things especially the main characters. Merlin was the best one and his character was great. Probably could have went on longer but they it many times.",2013
8,"Merlin follows Doctor Who and Robin Hood in to this crucial prime-time Saturday evening slot, and any programme occupying such a sought after position in the listings, has to be worth it's salt.",2008
8,"... and furthermore what if you threw out much of the Arthurian legend, kept the characters, and just shaped it such that it fit the mold of something that would make an interesting TV series? Well, that's what this show is. What got me interested was knowing that Anthony Head, the beloved Giles of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, was playing Uther Pendragon. From the first episode I was hooked. Unlike in the Arthurian legend, Uther, Morgana, and Arthur sit down to breakfast every morning like some normal modern day family, but that doesn't mean there aren't troubling undercurrents and issues between them. Arthur is a teen learning how to be a king - it is his destiny. Merlin is a teen learning magic from Gaius, but on the sly, because Gaius' position is that of court physician. Uther has had the practice of magic banned from the land, but I'll let you watch and find out why.",2016

10,"Merlin is (in my opinion) the best way of telling the well-known and loved Arthurian legend! We get to know a lot more about the characters of the legend, especially Merlin, and the new characters introduced, both heroes and villains, fit in perfectly with the ancient yet fresh theme of the series! The settings used in the series are some of the most beautiful settings you'll probably ever see on screen and the music perfectly links with the scenes they're involved in and will further intrigue the viewers into all the spellbinding and sword slashing-action going on! The acting is of high standards with the best chosen actors who suit their characters so well you'd have thought they were actually those characters in real life! The heroes are lovable, the villains are hate-able...what more could you want? I would've given it a 10 out 10 if the ending wasn't of such a poor standard due to its lack of thrilling action it's shown throughout and the deaths of some of the main and most important characters in the entire series!",2013

1,"To my mind, no-one has yet made a screen version of the Arthurian legends that really does them justice, and there's certainly been nothing that can compare even to modern literary interpretations like Mary Stewart's Merlin novels ('The Crystal Cave' and 'The Hollow Hills'). The best so far IMO was the recent Hallmark miniseries 'Merlin' with Sam Neill, which came closer than most, though it still left something to be desired. However it comes off looking like Shakespeare by comparison with the BBC's putrid confection. Despite the glossy production values, high-end SFX, spunky young leads and a solid supporting cast of British veterans, this laughable tripe is clearly aimed at the teeny Harry Potter market and is obviously cast in the same mould as the Beeb's equally execrable mauling of ""Robin Hood"".",2009
5,"Suppose you hear there is a new TV series called ""Baggins."" It's about Bilbo Baggins, a midget who runs a traveling poker game on his river raft, and his wife Frodo, the goodhearted cook who is trying to turn the river raft into a four star restaurant. They are approached by Gandalf, who wants them to join his seven burly bearded friends in a seven samurai type story to rescue a village he knows from becoming victims of a scam artist who stealing all the gold in the area. What? We're just retelling the story!",2009
10,"I only started to watch Merlin during season 2 here in Canada and thought now this is a great show why haven't I heard more about it? I went looking for and watched season 1 and noticed that the show got better with each episode. I re-watched season 2 and yes the same. The deeper plot was continued and each individual episode plot became more and more intricate and gripping. It's easy to see the progression from a new show to a mature and professional series when one watches so many episodes back to back. I can say unequivocally that Merlin is well worth the watch. Watching the Final season on Canada's Space Channel and the series has really matured into a professional and exciting series that I want more of. Now I find out it's canceled? What on earth are they thinking! It's just starting to get ""Hollywood good"" and they pull the plug? Worst TV decision ever made. Maybe another network will buy the rights and produce more seasons... HINT HINT!!!",2013
10,"I'm so attached to this series,so much that i cried knowing the series ended.i love the cast,the plot and even its ending.. so thankful i'd given the series a chance in the beginning.my family watched it too,not missing a single episode. thought it was boring at 1st but i got hooked up after.the series didn't follow closely about king arthur's legend but the twist in the storyline makes the series a refreshing one.i hated angel coulby at 1st.i thought that they should have paired arthur with a prettier actress but i love her now.also not forgetting the beautiful friendship between arthur and merlin in the last episode which had made me love the series even more than before.how i miss merlin right now..i hope to see the cast reprising their role once more in the future.but for now i must say farewell Merlin...",2013
10,"For me, Merlin was an incredible series. I thoroughly enjoyed the saga from the first episode, all the way through to the finale. I really hope they release another series (though I don't see how it would work). I will honestly say I was a little disappointed with the final episode, I was surprised to see how simple Morganna's death was, I was expecting some sort of magic duel between them, instead, Merlin merely slays Morganna with Excalibur. I was deeply upset to see Arthur die, and a little confused as to how Merlin suddenly became immortal. Nevertheless, it was a phenomenal television series with a lot of twists and well thought out plots. I enjoyed seeing the vast variety of creatures and mythical characters. Other enjoyable aspects of the series include the filming location, costumes, props, and sets.",2012
10,"This is a fantastic show. It is a quality production throughout, with a cinematic quality, and attention to detail that you wouldn't necessarily expect from a TV series. This is even more apparent in series 2 where they seem to have been given a bigger budget.",2009
1,"I was honestly recommending this series to my peers. The first season was quite enjoyable, even though the Merlin portrayed in this series has very little in common with the Merlin of legend.",2010
1,"Let me first say I have no problem modernizing mythologies. And how could I? We don't even have a contemporary account of the Arthur/Merlin legend - Sir Mallory fitted a dark age myth into 15th century clothes, T.H. White inserted 20th century anachronisms and commentary into his Merlin of The Once and Future King. There has never been a version of this story that hasn't had the storyteller's own era stamped all over it, so modernization is not a complaint I or anyone else can make. I'm also fond of the premise; surely there is so much yet unexplored with a character like Merlin. ",2016
9,"Like many others, I saw the world premiere of Clone Wars on Cartoon Network, and I have to say, I was very impressed. George Lucas has done it again! Now I actually have something to look forward to on Friday nights. The characters act pretty much act like they do in the movies, all the voices sound great, the animation is amazing, and the episodes actually have a plot! I will agree, however, that I don't think it was quite necessary for Lucasfilm to release a movie version just for the sake of promoting the television show. I hear that they're making at least a hundred episodes or more, so hopefully they'll live up to the first two. A job well done all around.",2008
10,"Well, after a sceptical start with the clone wars animated movie, the actual TV series is getting better and better. Slightly bumpy start however. (Droid voices????) But as the ""Shadow of malevolence storyline unfolds, it is clear that Star Wars is back in star wars territory. Great little storyline, and episode 3 is just true to the spirit of the original Trilogy and yet keeps with the clone wars setting. Episodes 4 & 5 are even better, and as a listener to the podcasts on theforce.net the interviews are brilliant too. The creators are aware of what we like and don't and they reassure us not to worry, as some very cool stuff is still in the pipeline. ",2008

9,It started out with the movie which I wasn't impressed with accept for the animation and Ventress was in it. On October 3rd I didn't think the rest of The Clone Wars story would be anything special now I know I was wrong. If your a fan of Star Wars and you appreciate the prequels then give Clone Wars a shot. Some episodes our just about clones I know that doesn't sound very good but it is actually just as entertaining as the rest of the episodes. Star Wars The Clone Wars is a great TV show and if you are a Star Wars fan and are not watching it. I strongly suggest you do cause it might make time go by while waiting for the live action series. And also if you have not already check out Star Wars The Force Unleashed.,2008
10,"3 episodes in and wow! What a series. Hasn't premiered in the uk yet so I have been watching the episodes on the net (yes naughty naughty I know) and I have been mesmerised.

7,"What can you say about ""The Clone Wars""? Well as many of you already have said it's a way for the franchise to pick up some new fans from the younger viewers. As for me, being the age that I saw ESB and ROTJ when they first premiered at the cinemas, it found the series... en-joyful. If you are a real star wars fan and are thirsting for more about the universe and, as I have, read all the books from the expanded universe (ofcourse not the young jedi ones and well, fell asleep after vector prime but anyway back on track)you will like this, maby not in the beginning, I know the voices are not the real ones and jada jada. Just sit back relax and think that this is STAR WARS, it's not supposed to be a ""sundance winning indie"" it't franchise and we LOVE IT.",2008
7,The Clone Wars is a new TV show that is set in the Star Wars universe between Episode 2 and Episode 3 of the Star Wars saga. I saw this show as soon as it premiered in Canada and I was impressed with some parts of the show and also not impressed. I loved the animation design of the whole atmosphere of the galaxy and the design of all the characters. It was colorful and very creative just like you'd see in every Star Wars movie. I also enjoyed the voice acting even though most of the main actors in the live action movies never returned. The dialogue at sometimes was a bit cheesy at times and the way some of the droids talked was just plain stupid and it could annoy many fans. Besides that though the other actors are very good voice actors.,2008
10,"This is soo awesome, its like watching so many new movies and trust me I know and love all movies in Star Wars franchise very well, (yes first three including) Perhaps this is one of best proves how first three movie prequels which got so much unfair low ratings and attacks on genius as is Lucas himself (specially that awful low IQ song about him GL raped our childhood..)made more than enough sense ! If he made Star Wars (are those fools who attack Him aware He is Creator of Star Wars ??!!) in the first place,of course he would knew very well how to make prequels as well !! SO they are same level loved by me as 4,5,6 episodes are ! And then he made animated CLone Wars (2008),I didn't watch them yet before now cause I didn't expect cartoons to be of any interest for me. But I gave it a try and I am soo impressed, wow what a gem ! There is action filled with emotions, great effects..and awesome stories, so so good ! No doubt about highest rating here for me ! I also watched briefly SW Rebels and they are also awesome but not so much as Clone Wars for me, probably cause CW was directed still by Georce the Boss Lucas and Rebels are not (but still great animation series) So I am changing big time my concepts that animations cannot be entertaining, they can even more than movie if well made !! I hope many more enjoy this as much as I do :-))",2017

9,"I was amazingly surprised by this series. I've always loved the Star Wars films, but until recently had avoided the animated side of things for fear that they'd be too childlike or not of terribly great quality. Watching The Clone Wars Movie didn't do much to allay my fears, although the animation was impressive the rest of the quality was questionable, to say the least.",2014

5,"this show is a puzzle to me. with high coloured weird cartoon style and totally flat characters, this show has all the makings of a show for kids. but sometimes there are episodes, specially those without the all powerful, invincible and absolutely booooring jedi, that have really good writing and a greater sense for the star wars universe, with interesting twists and turns, diplomatic actions, political ramifications, real threats, real villains, desertion, tragedy and the designs are just mega awesome. those are the episodes that really speak to a wider, more mature audience and make this show enjoyable even for me.",2014
8,"Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2003) was a series that was brilliantly made, and to be honest this one is even better. Its certainly more watchable, as this series contains much better visual effects and better animations. When this series first came out, I was thrilled. I immediately began watching it, and after watching the first episode 'Ambush', I realised how much GL has put into this. Unlike TPM and AOTC, this series is full of potential. The first episode proved how great this series can be, and to be honest, the episodes in Season 1 just got better and better.",2011

Fortunately my being candid will work out in the positive because I absolutely love this TV series to death.",2014
1,"Despite being a Star Wars fan, I can easily say this and the other Star Wars: The Clone Wars animated movie upon which this is based are just plain terrible. The story lines are generic with no creativity. The cartoon never mentions anything about the Clone Wars era itself, such as the underlying evil of the Republic or the fact that the CIS wasn't led by Grievous or Dooku, but was led by Sidious (Palpatine), so there really isn't much of a connection to this and the the actual movie (the live-action one, not the animated one). The battles in this show range from stupid to horrendous. One Clone trooper apparently can slaughter 1500 Battle Droids with relative ease, and all the droids really do is make some kind of idiotic self-insult about their own stupidity. Even when they do try to kill the clones, they rarely hit anything:",2009

First of all, character development is fantastic and after a few episodes you will be hooked! There are a few boring episodes but the ratio of good episodes to bad, have the good outweighing the bad 5:1. The voice acting on this show is great and the ties it makes with the Star Wars universe is a nice nod to Star Wars fans. The last season they made was the best of all and with the addition of old and new characters I strongly advise watching this T.V series.",2015

7,"In 2003, Ang Lee's Hulk was released to commercial success  breaking box office records for a June opening and smashing its way to the top of the box office, it outperformed many analysts' expectations and was well on its way to becoming one of the biggest comic book films ever produced.",2008
8,"Honestly, as soon as I heard they were making another Hulk movie I was surprised. When I heard they had cast Ed Norton, I was shocked. So going into this movie I had no idea what to expect. Coming out, I feel like an idiot because it was really masterfully done. Lettier does an amazing job, Norton was fantastic, and as far as a comic book movie goes, this one is just about on top with little nods and mentions. If you don't walk out of this film screaming HELLL YEAAAA, then you are not normal. Far better than Ang Lee's attempt at the green man and as far as this year, it's definitely Marvel's year. No better way to make up for Spiderman 3 than releasing Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk just a month apart. Thank you Marvel for cleaning the mess Spiderman 3 left and clearing your name. This film just makes me thing of one word...AVENGERS",2008
10,"Take a deep breath when you enter the cinema to see this one because it's just downright breathtaking. THE INCREDIBLE HULK is an amazing summer blockbuster movie. This reboot has made Ang Lee's Hulk back in 2003 seem like it never existed. Edward Norton's version portrays what Hulk is supposed to be on the big screen. Do not bootleg this one, do not wait til it hit DVD, Go watch it in the theaters because I guarantee you it is worth every penny. This movie is spectacular and superb in every way. It's a rock 'em smash 'em, jaw dropping thrill ride.",2008
8,I went into this completely blind. I wanted a pure 'experience' I saw ONE trailer prior to this screening and closed my eyes while humming. I had no idea if this was a second in the series or a re-make.,2008
9,"The crowded streets and cluttered housing on the streets of Rio De Janeiro provided some reminiscence of Jackie Chan's Police Story, where you could be sure of a chase scene zig- zagging the streets to take advantage of the wonderful opportunities presented for an exhilarating chase. And Leterrier doesn't try not to provide action junkies plenty of action- smashing moments as we root for Bruce Banner to hulk up, unfortunately of course, to satisfy our lust for some unadulterated action where everything in the way of the Hulk, gets smashed. However those expecting action from the get go will be disappointed, as there were only a small handful of action sequences, though of course they include the classic moments that comic fans had been baying for since 4 years ago. So I guess most will be left happy as we see some nifty moves by the Hulkster, which will leave a smile on your face, despite being used in limited doses. But I note though that the story cum action, looked a little bit like Superman II with the seeking of a cure and the deliberate loss of power to be with the lady love, and the duking out between super-beings on equal footing (here being gamma-powered), with a tinge of Cloverfield like moments too.",2008
10,"By the looks of the ending of Ang Lee's Hulk (2003) it seemed that there is going to be a sequel. After 5 years we now have The Incredible Hulk which is a reboot like Batman Begins. The reboot was a better idea than a sequel because Hulk (2003) wasn't a bad movie but wasn't even great either and was better off as a one film itself. But if the first attempt at a Hulk movie left you feeling a little green, good news! This version has a whole new cast, a whole new mood, and even a whole new retelling of The Hulk's origin",2008
9,"I wasn't really sure if I'd like the movie. Ang Lee's version didn't please me at all. It didn't have enough action and it had far too much dialogue. I had never really been a fan of the Hulk comics, but I did like all the movie adaptations of the Marvel Comics. While I didn't enjoy The Incredible Hulk as much as Iron Man, it's still great fun, and it will definitely make a big profit at the box office, and hopefully more money than the first did.",2008

1,"Somebody owes Ang Lee an apology. Actually, a lot of people do. And I'll start. I was never interested in the Ang Lee film Hulk, because of the near unanimous bad reviews.

The thinking man's King Kong on a self-help quest? They just can't help but fall back on the same clichés and feeble structure with good ol' time-warps to fast-track to the climatic fight scene -and prep it up for the sequel before rolling the credits. Depravity is when you have a super-bezerking giant on a havoc-spree toned down to pg-13.

I did enjoy it to an extent; it was a bit slow-moving and there were some parts that needed some improvement, but it was overall a decent film. I do agree that Louis Letterier's 2008 film was a vast improvement, though. It improved on all of the issues I had with Lee's film. The film is a reboot of the dying franchise: Bruce Banner has been hiding in Brazil, attempting to keep a low profile while he searches for a cure for his condition, but General Ross becomes aware of his location and enlists the aid of Emil Blonsky, a soldier with a mean streak. A bit of non-sanctioned experimentation later and Blonsky becomes a creature rivaling even the Hulk in power.",2008

1,"OK, let me start off with a confession, I do not like Edward Norton. I do not like him as an actor, and I do not like him as a person. I believe he is the product of all the worst aspects of the misused and misunderstood practice of method acting, and I think he's an egomaniac and a terrible ""Film maker"", see ""American History X"" for what I mean. So lets get to ""The Hulk"". This film was of course going to be compared to Ang Lee's commercial and critical failure ""Hulk"". I myself did not like ""Hulk"", but I have to admit that it had more to do with the writing and the story than with the actors and film makers. ""Hulk"" actually had some original ideas in how to present the mythology of a comic book on film. The cast i felt in that movie was actually good, they just had a crap story to work with. ""Hulk"" was really an overwrought soap opera between the title character and his father, which to be fair in 80's the comic did explore Banner's relationship with his father and it explained his anger issues.",2008
6,"The Incredible Hulk is a tough character to adapt and I really think any filmmaker would have trouble making a good film version of the green guy. When a comic book film is adapted to the big screen the movie goer wants a story to balance the action and in this movie we have no story. The entire film is a special effects extravaganza wrapped in between pieces of bad dialouge and characterization. Creating an effective Bruce Banner is key to making any Hulk adaptation work and it hasn't been done yet. The original Incredible Hulk series that is beloved by so many plays like a melodramatic continuation of Adam West's Batman series, and Ang Lee's Hulk, which I feel is still the best adaptation of the story, tried to add too much dramatic substance.",2008

2,"There ought to be a law for relaunches of a franchise less than five years after the last attempt: every negative must be destroyed if it winds up being even worse. From start to finish, this was a total mess of a film that seemed more interested in finding room for not-so-subtle cameos and wink-nudge-grins than telling a functional story. Knocking out the Hulk's fabled origin story during the opening credits may have freed up the rest of the picture to explore new territory, but it also killed the basis of the cast's relationships and removed any reason for the audience to care about them. Ed Norton and Liv Tyler turn in genuinely rotten performances, with a black hole of chemistry as an on-screen duo, that are neither true to the original characters nor interesting in the slightest. Bruce Banner never comes off as remotely intelligent, let alone the super genius he'd have to be to come up with the formula that turned him into the Hulk, and actually spends more time running from grossly generic government operatives than using his brains. That effectively kills the intriguing contrast between he and the Hulk that should be fueling the story. Both characters are mindlessly running, just in opposite directions. Corny dialog, predictable twists and turns, weak CG, flat characterization and sleepwalking actors - this blew up in Marvel's face.",2011
1,"This film simply breaks all the rules of storytelling. The characters are empty, the plot-line is empty and the makers must have been on holiday and allowed a primary school to manage the project.

1,"Hulk is a very interesting character. One with a Prometheus fate that could destroy a whole city in a few minutes in a brutal and fierce rage. The one you will see in this movie ? Well... he loves to run in dark places (you know, places where we can't see him very well), yell a lot, stay quietly in love with an ex-girlfriend, yell a lot, break some glasses and, Ô surprise, yell a lot and take the time to kick the ass of the bad guy, surprisingly more bigger and ugly than Hulk. The other surprise of this movie is that the bad guy won't even try to kick Hulk's ex-girlfriend ...huh ... wait ... wrong, he obviously tried it of course, with Hulk aaaaaaaaall the way yelling at him !

So that's my starting point when considering this movie which I have just been to see with my 80-year old mother.",2008
1,"Having avoided seeing the movie in the cinema, but buying the DVD for my wife for Xmas, I had to watch it. I did not expect much, which usually means I get more than I bargained for. But 'Mamma Mia' - utter, utter cr**. I like ABBA, I like the songs, I have the old LPs. But this film is just terrible. The stage show looks like a bit of a musical, but this races along with songs hurriedly following one another, no characterisation, the dance numbers (which were heavily choreographed according to the extras on the DVD) are just thrown away with only half the bodies ever on screen, the dance chorus of north Europeans appear on a small Greek island at will, while the set and set up of numbers would have disgraced Cliff Richard's musicals in the sixties!Meryl (see me I'm acting)Streep can't even make her usual mugging effective in an over-the-top musical! Her grand piece - 'The Winner Takes It All' - is Meryl at the Met! Note to director - it should have been shot in stillness with the camera gradually showing distance growing between Streep and Brosnan! Some of the singing is awful karaoke on amateur night. The camera cannot stop moving like bad MTV. One can never settle down and just enjoy the music, enthusiasm and characters. But what is even worse is how this botched piece of excre**** has become the highest grossing film in the UK and the best selling DVD to boot? Blair, Campbell and New Labour really have reduced the UK to zombies - critical faculties anyone???",2009
10,I saw this film at the screening on Sunday and was not too sure of what to expect from it. I hadn't seen the west end show so was not really aware of the story line but that really did not matter.,2008
1,"I like Abba but couldn't stand the singing, ",2009
10,"I didn't know what to expect when going into watch ""Mamma Mia"", was this gonna be another Hairspray or Across the Universe or Rent? This was a lighthearted, quite enjoyable movie of its own style, Meryl Strep blew the entire audience away with her comedic persona in this movie. After seeing her in Devil Wears Prada, you are shaken momentarily after seeing her climb on top a roof singing ""Mamma Mia!"" and swoon and the dance teenage giddy girl dance. You'll love this movie for trio of older woman characters, they were all so funny. Mr. James Bond's character and singing was such a hilarious delight for the audience, we couldn't believe this was the man who played a top secret spy agent.",2008
2,"Yikes. I have always been a Streep fan, but I have never seen anything like this. I don't know what they did to her, but throughout most of this film - I will blame the director, choreographer and editors - she is so manically jubilant and expressive and hyper-active that I was afraid the poor woman had developed an addiction to chrystal meth! In fact, most of the cast fairs poorly. Only Julie Walters seems to realize that she is in the midst of one colossal joke. For all the mania and energy forced upon these people, their deadliest flaw is that they seem to be taking this whole story seriously.",2009

But for the fact that we had checked the running time in advance and seen that it was only about 100 minutes, I'd have totally lost the will to live, but I knew there would eventually be light at the end of the darkest of tunnels.",2010
1,"I cannot remember a more trivial, mind numbing and shallow film in other words a real chick flick of the worst kind. How can anyone watch this film and recommend it to others ? Only if they don't like admitting they made a mistake. It seems to summarise the worst of female aspirations. No real substance to it all happy and shallow. Yeah that'll please the masses. Well not this member of the masses. What a trivial load of drivel. I wanted to leave the cinema within 5 minutes of the start. And to think I paid £7 to see this ! I think this does however represent the dumbing down of cinema as with most media these days. So I like a bit of reality in my musicals call me sad or what ?",2008

1,"Utter rubbish. Not worthy of the big screen. This did better than The Dark Knight! How? Why? How - mass advertising. How - popular soundtrack. Why - beats me!! Someone sold their soul to Satan himself to turn a profit on this piece of moldy crusty crud! Don't bother with this - rent Old Boy instead, or THE DARK KNIGHT ! This is by far the worst movie ever made. Serves it's purpose as a play/dramatization and nothing more. Movie? You're kidding! Acting performances are shoddy at best, storyline has been done over and over and over again. But still.. people flock to the cinema with the kids to see this manure! Take them to see Bee Movie or Kung Fu Panda; cracking movies and they serve their purpose well. Enough of this rant; Don't watch this, you will regret the entire thing",2011
1,"This is the worst movie I have seen in the last five years. If you think ugly Americans stinking it up in a foreign country is bad, you should see these Brits ruining a picturesque little slice of Greece. Everybody acts like they're drunk and having a grand old time-- it's excruciating to watch. Nobody can sing. Meryl Streep has done somber, depressed roles in the past that are really good, but she is just terrible in this movie. I hope this doesn't mean she has lost her ability to pick good roles for herself. This movie felt like the actors got on board because they thought it would be great fun to have a party in Greece, but they forgot they had to make a movie.",2009
8,"With this big opening weekend either you're going to see the darker film The Dark Knight or you are going to see something more light hearted like Mamma Mia! Now I work at a movie theater, a lot of people were just assuming that everyone was going to see The Dark Knight, yesterday someone came up disappointed saying ""my show sold out""... I looked at her with a smiling face and said ""oh, yeah, dark knight, I know""... she said ""no, mamma mia"", I looked up all surprised, Mamma Mia sold out as well, people were really looking forward to this movie as well. I did see this movie on Saturday and really enjoyed it, as cheesy as it was, I do enjoy musicals, I think the only thing is that this this is the happiest musical that I have ever seen. So it was nice to just sit there and be happy with these characters and you can't help but laugh at the predicaments that they get themselves into.",2008
1,"I couldn't watch all the film, but this is my understanding of the story line. The character played by Meryl Streep was a slut who slept with three guys. Her daughter doesn't seem bothered by this and starts singing about it as though it's romantic. She decided to write to all three men, inviting them to her wedding, so that she could find out which one is her father.",2008
2,"I will preface this by stating that I am a big fan of movie musicals, be they off-the-wall masterpieces such as 'Dancer in the Dark', top-end popcorn fare ('Hairspray') or Broadway adaptations ('Chicago', 'Evita' et al). So, no-one can accuse me of hating the genre, and blaming my negatives comments on that. Abba are the undisputed monarchs of modern pop, and I adore them. I wanted to adore this movie. I really did. I have to say, I found the stage version contrived and obvious, and didn't enjoy it at all. But I really did think that given the freedom of location shooting and a top-notch casting, this could be something special. How wrong I was.",2008
1,"It doesn't matter whether or not you like ABBA. This movie is horrible. By far the WORST film musical I've ever seen. I Loved Mamma Mia on Broadway but this is true crap. Did it not occur to the film makers that they should actually find people who can sing????? It doesn't matter that they act well if they can't sing. THe Broadway show is a wonderful fluff musical, but the songs are so poorly executed that you can't enjoy them AT ALL. And the musical numbers are sooooooo poorly directed, they are laughable. The movie has a great look, and some of the cast make me laugh (a bit). But the movie sucks. Anyone who thinks this is a good film simply cannot look past their ABBA fetish. Avoid this film, even if your curiosity is peaking. You will be sorely disappointed.",2012
1,"I love musicals, all of them, from joyous Oklahoma, to Poignant Porgy and Bess, to the touching romantic ""Damn Yankees."" And I know most of the songs, sometimes singing them spontaneously, with a crowd or humming them alone.",2008
7,"I did enjoy this romp in the Greek Islands and was surprised at how well Meryl Streep sang. It's light, full of froth and bubble and perhaps has some aspects of Grease and Bollywood in it. The reason the music works I feel is that they haven't really messed with the arrangements of the songs keeping them generally faithful to the Abba originals. But Pierce Brosnan's vocal efforts were abysmal, almost laughable. Perhaps it was meant to be a send up of the original songs all the way through but he really did manage to mangle the vocals in my opinion. If you have seen the musical on stage you will know what to expect and there are some funny moments in the film and the Greek islands are as always a superb backdrop for the action.",2008
5,"Armed with irresistible hooks, soaring melodies and near-celestial vocal stylings, the Swedish pop group ABBA churned out a body of insanely catchy and superbly crafted tunes - ""Waterloo,"" ""SOS,"" ""Fernando,"" ""Dancing Queen,"" ""The Winner Takes it All,"" etc. - that made it the world's top-selling musical act of the 1970's and early 1980's. Several decades later, ABBA's music became the basis for a hit stage musical entitled ""Mamma Mia!"" in which a simple narrative was deftly woven around many of the quartet's songs. Now, the much-ballyhooed movie version of ""Mamma Mia!,"" written by Catherine Johnson and directed by Phyllida Lloyd, has arrived on the scene.",2008

10,When I saw the trailers on TV I started to jump and sing. After seeing the shows with interviews I got anxious to see the movie. ,2008
1,"I don't know where most of you were at, but where I watched the film we didn't have people singing as some have told they experienced, we had people laughing, mostly at the campy plot line, the horrible dance sequences and the singing of the likes of Brosnan. The only people in the audience who seemed to be enthralled with the film were the seventies generation folks who were some how reliving the past with the songs. I was a DJ in the seventies and even went to the ABBA concert at Northlands Coliseum in Edmonton in Sept of 79, so I did appreciate them then and I still do now. But this film should have gone the same way as their marriages and ended in divorce. The sequences were so poorly staged, the dubbing and editing absolutely horrible and this has to be Meryl's worst production. I cannot believe an academy award winner would stoop so low as to do this piece of garbage. So save your money, wait for it to come out on DVD and then maybe spend your money on something better, like cat litter.",2008
10,I have literally been forced to write a review for this because I am sick of the amount of people insulting this show for such ridiculous reasons!,2009
9,"after watching the season i would like to congratulate the network in producing a wonderful show. the story lines were good and very realistic and the idea of the show was good. the season finale was amazing. unlike most shows it had a mixture of things going on. and it leaves you wanting more. i admire the shows writers for using a topic that isn't very common on shows these days. silver mental illness was very well written, realistic and she was able to portray the character well. sure some bits of the show are a bit stupid like the stereotypical characters, annoying actors (shenae grimes) but considering some other shows out there, it is definitely better than most. a i am sick of watching shows based just on love. its so annoying. finally a show that has different issues as well. and most of the actors are great. Jessica Stroup and Jessica Lowndes are the two most brilliant actors on this show. ",2009
2,"OK, to me this was just too much of the same story. Obviously it is set up to be a teen drama, but the fact that they main family is once again a family from the Midwest that has been transplanted to Beverly Hills and they're trying to find their place.",2008
6,"As I see it, everyone is comparing it too much with the original series. It has not much to do with it, except for the setting and some of the original characters (that I believe were put in just to grab attention). Personally, I see it as a whole new project and I don't care much about the old one. ",2009
6,"The only reason why I gave It a 7 is because It has potential. I liked the beginning. When I first sow It at first I though that It's going to be a good series. The main problem with It is the writers. In stead of just making a good series the writers felt the urge to give the character some really weird personalities. either the are too dumb, too emotional, angry or the are just freaks. It's like the writers literally said ,,hey the story is too simple, so we should create our own awful one''. It really is sad to think If they just made a series about normal teenagers, instead of emotionally troubled ones, It would have been a pretty decent series. Hope It improves soon. Also why did they cast actors which, the ones playing the parents look 30 years, and the ones playing their kids look 20 years old?",2009
5,"Okay let me first start with the fact the first half of season one was clichéd, boring and dumb. So it would explain why people where bashing it when it came out.",2009
3,"I very rarely have the urge to go to the web and state my opinion about a show, whether I like or dislike it. But judging from the first two episodes I hated this OC-ized version of a 90ties classic so much that for once I did feel the urge. What can I say, in my opinion this show seriously sucks (or bites, or blows, if you've seen the first 20 seconds).",2008
10,"I am so sick and tired of people saying they do not like the show because is nothing like the old one... well duh that's the point of the show, and that's why I like it. I can relate more to this show, the status of what teenagers are doing is more effective, and the drama is more relatable than the other one. This is by far my favorite show on television. I like how they mix in the new characters with the old, and the old kind of stepped out of their old character and have been modified into someone relatable for adults. The drama's are exciting, and the story lines are amazing. I absolutely without a doubt love this show and if people don't like it well obviously you guys care enough to trash it, but please don't ruin it for those of us who love it :D",2009

From the poster of the main characters in a 90210 pool in their smoking hot bikinis and bathing suits, you can tell which direction this show is headed. It's another trite, contrived, ""I have more money and a nicer car than you"" type show. Oh and there's a black kid...I guess he's there to even things out.",2008
1,"I never missed one episode of the old 90210 because it was so cheesy and great and I fell in love with the characters especially Kelly and Dillon. This 90210 sucks! All the characters are lame! No one is intriguing and wants you to watch them every week to see what happens like the old one. The best part about the new season was to see Kelly , Brenda and Nat. It was interesting to hear about what they have been doing. Like Kelly having a 4 year old child. I wonder if it is with Dillon, I hope so. All the old characters should just wait like Sex and the City did and do the original right, a couple years from now. This program will never last. It blows! Bummer!",2008
1,"Tons of teen movie & drama has been produced in the last 20 years, some of them produced good results and others not. 90210 belongs to the second category. I didn't have high expectations on this drama, first of all because it lacks of originality and almost all the remakes and spin-off doesn't succeed to get the same quality of the original (why people can't have original ideas even if they are payed to do it?!). When I see it I thought ""what is it?!...a collage between BH90210, the OC and the last TDramas that have been produced in the last years? And the actors... are they really acting? Am I the only one who looks at them and see that they are stiffer than a dummy, than a mannequin"" My Advice? If u want to see a good telefilm 4 teen and enjoy yourself for an evening watch One tree hill, the OC, Dawson's creek, Buffy or if u're nostalgic watch again the original Beverly Hills but pleeeease don't look at this lame show.",2008
4,"This show is not so bad that it's unwatchable. But the issue is this. It's billed as a remake of ""Beverly Hills, 90210"" and yet it doesn't contain any of the elements that made 90210 a smash to begin with. Gone is the sly sense of humor the first show had, gone is the group of actors that fans came to love, gone are the characters that America related to. Gone are all the cheesy, yet addictive elements that made the show worth watching. Instead we have some half-baked soap opera without any of the fun qualities that made people watch the first series.",2009
1,"I seriously urge anyone who grew up in the 1990's to not watch this. In fact, avoid it like it's the plague. Remember when we were kids and used to watch Dylan McKay and Brandon Walsh duke it out on the original? Yeah this is not that. At all. Don't even waste your time.",2012
2,"90210 is obviously a spin off of Beverly Hills 90210, a popular teen series of the 90's. Production is trying to aim at quite a few target audiences, teens, people who used to watch the original series (original characters featured), housewives (parents problems, active photographer mom), maybe grandmas (crazy grandma and friends, all the drama...)! They have done quite a bit of recycling there by including several characters of the original show, even thought they are secondary. As well as that you can find the actress who played Jessy's partner in Full House, Rob Estes from Melrose Place, the bit**y/unbearable teen from Nip/Tuck (really what other kind of parts could she play), and even an appearance of Edie's bad ass nephew from Desperate housewives...",2009
1,"why are people allowed to produce these kind of shows? The acting is bad. And no, it's not because they have nothing to work with, it's because they are bad actors. Age is not an excuse!If you can't act just stay home!Especially the ""leading"" lady, annie... The plot is awful. Just because they come from Kansas it doesn't mean they are supposed to be stupid or incredibly naive. What? They don't have cable or internet in Kansas? Are they still hunting for food, too? The characters. I don't even know where to start. Drug-abuse, pregnancy, indifferent mother, boyfriend dumping you...why isn't that girl trying to kill herself? Or better yet why isn't SHE the leading lady? Only one of those 3 should be enough to ruin one show so i don't even know why this one is still running. And even if i could ignore all those things, i can't ignore the fact that it's such a bad example for teenagers everywhere. Girls should eat more than salad, and they should not look like they just got out of Auschwitz. And why does every show concentrate on the popular kids in school when they represent only like 1% of student body? i'm not from the states and in high school we didn't have popular kids.and our lives didn't revolve around school.and it was great! I wasn't a fan of the original show (actually i wasn't allowed to watch it because my parents thought it would give a bad example) and i only saw a few episodes now and then,but comparing the two it's like comparing Sophie's Choice to American Pie. ",2009
7,"Pretty much on the mark. The show is boring. I like Rob Estes and would love to see him added with a point, he was not someone avid watchers knew about. What about Tori, it was her dad's show and she was a pivotal cast member. Do a true reunion show, what this is makes no sense. The only relation is Kelly( Jenny Garth) and her sister. I was an avid 90210 watcher and when I heard about the show I assumed it was to show where they are now, not this mess of players that has no relationship to the original. I do not care about the new people unless you are going to throw in the original cast and make connections.",2008
1,"Being the huge Beverly Hills 90210 fan as I am, I couldn't resist taking a peek at 90210, seeing how the danish media promoted it as ""the continuation of a classic"". The pilot not only filled me with consternation, but along with the following episodes it also proved that humanity will never be able to recreate the beauty of classics like Beverly Hills 90210.",2009
3,"I watched for a few seasons and somewhat got sucked in with the mediocre at best storyline, but stopped watching because I realized how terrible this was. I don't understand how it's still on the air---I guess because the demographic is watching this, and I really hope they would stop, since there are much better shows on. ",2012
1,"What's the point of calling this a spin off series when it has little to do with the original series. This show feels like a rushed version of every other teen drama ever produced. Someone seems to be breaking up and hooking up with a new character every episode. There is nothing new, interesting, or original about this show. There are so many unanswered questions and the new generation is bland, boring, and irrelevant. At least with the original you got a sense of who the characters were.",2009

9,"French horror has been pushing the boundaries for some time now. First there was Haute Tension, then A l'Intérieur and newest in line is Martyrs, hyped up to take it all a little further. And it did, it definitely did. It's just that it doesn't belong in the same list as the films mentioned before. Martyrs goes way beyond.",2008
9,"Having missed the opportunity to catch this at the Midnight Madness showing in TIFF08, I decided to go against all stated horror movie rules and watched this today around midday at a complex in downtown Toronto.. It's difficult to know what to say about this movie really; like a birth or a death, you really have to experience it yourself and draw your own conclusions. What I will say is that as a committed horror freak, rare is the occasion when I tense up and watch a film contorted, somehow trying to protect myself from what I'm putting myself through.. It contains enough tough to see horror/gore to satisfy the bloodhounds (though it doesn't feel like another attempt to up the gore ante for the sake of it, thankfully) and then - if you can watch it and many couldn't - transcends the genre totally with a jaw-dropping final act which if you're interested in the human condition and the capacity for seemingly normal people to do incredibly bad things will have you asking questions for some time to come and recognising that when horror and ideas mesh successfully, the result can be breathtaking. Absolutely not enjoyable but there again if you go to see a horror flick at a film festival and you know beforehand that it originally received an X-certificate in France, kicking up an almighty stink in the process - well, you know that an open mind is the least you can bring to bear. With that in mind I would recommend Martyrs as a film of incredible tension, harrowing physical violence and indelible imagery; unsurprisingly, the director name-checked Dario Argento during the Q&A as a major influence in his youth and there is a clear and confident signature in the work which suggests some parallels can be made between the two film-makers. I loved this movie and for those who have already posted comments good, bad or indifferent (and I really can't imagine a neutral response!) I hope like myself you have come away with a genuine sense of having seen something the like of which we are unlikely to see for some time..",2008

7,"The film was introduced by the film's writer director Pascal Laugier at this year's Frightfest in London. The organiser's referred to the film as ""The film they most wanted"" of the 28 shown at the festival. It was easy to see why. Of all the films I saw at this year's Frightfest, Martyrs was not my favourite but without a doubt it is the one that plays on my mind the most. The film has been compared to both Hostel and Hellraiser but I think it has a lot more substance than both of those films. The central performances are top notch and Jessie Pham as the young Lucie is very convincing, completely holding your attention. So why only 7 out of 10? As well made as this film is, the subject matter is just so utterly disturbing I wanted this film to end a long time before it actually did. It is not a film that is to be enjoyed. It is not the escapism that you may be looking for. The first Act is a revenge story on a family who may or may not have been responsible for the kidnapping and torture of a young girl 15 years previously. It is the second Act though that is the more disturbing. The viewer wants it to end almost as much as the girl captured wants her ordeal to end. This is a must-see movie but certainly one that is going to divide audiences right down the middle.",2008

10,"Making its Stateside debut, Pascal Laugier's ""Martyrs"" was the grand finale to a spectacular constellation of fine horror films. ""Martyrs"" however, is not like a ""SAW"" or ""HOSTEL"" in which there are creative forms of torture served for your viewing pleasure, this film has an art house feel to it that leads into the bowels of depravity. It's demonstrates how evil man can be for the share pleasure of scientific research. It reminded me of a brochure that I received depicting the horrors of how animals are slaughtered for human consumption. If that is a brochure you'd rather not digest before dinner, ""Martyrs"" is the type of film you may not want to view on a full stomach. Brilliantly executed in ways better described only as experimental, Pascal Laugier takes us to the end of the tunnel, the last stop, to a place where there is no longer any separation between humans and animals, predators or prey, it' a place so dark, you will no longer have to imagine for now it has been recorded on celluloid. All the ""SAW"" or ""HOSTEL"" or any other torture porn created to date has nothing on ""Martyrs"". Why? Because they French know their cinema business like no other. They leave nothing up to the imagination and nothing is too taboo for them whereas here in America, filmmakers tend to like to draw certain lines when it comes to making horror films for shock value. ""Martyrs"" is one of the few crossover films that could play at a horror film festival, as well as a intellectually artsy festival or a gay & lesbian festival alike. It covers the gamut in storytelling and that is what makes this film so powerful and so inherently haunting ,it will carve many putrid memories in your phsyque long after viewing. I would not recommend this film to folks with weak stomachs.",2008

9,"I just got back from the midnight screening at TIFF, with a typical Midnight Madness audience that I would characterize as easy to please but difficult to impress. This film impressed us, as it was clearly a cut above (so to speak) the average genre film. The first act takes recent French horror films like High Tension, Inside and Frontiere(s) and shoves them into a hyper-violent blender. So far, so good. The second, far more emotionally grisly act elevates the cinematic experience to almost art-film heights, with sadly realistic parallels to our current insane world situation. Oh, there was a vomiting patron here, too.",2008

While this may be the goal of a typical horror film, this film takes large strides to make the torture something realistic, something that could really happen, and, therefore, all the more harrowing. Once the audience understands this, it expects something more than just typical slasher fare - it expects something deeper and thought provoking.

The French seem to think the more blood and gore you show the more horror fans will appreciate it.. And just like last year's movie ""Inside"", 90 percent of real horror movie fans in the world will never even want to see this piece of dribble ,, just fanboys on the internet will squeal in their immature delight.. I fought in a war where I saw bloody sites so thats not what I find offensive here, It's the fact that some people think seeing senseless human bloody carnage is actually entertainment.",2009
1,"As many reviews have pointed out before me, this is a polarising movie. You either absorb its messages as high art and embrace its philosophies with a willing mind, or if you're like me it will leave you hollow from a lack of resolution; at which point all that's left is an exercise in gratuitousness.",2009
1,"Really, this film adds nothing valuable. The real philosophical issue could have been presented in less than ten minutes. The rest of it is nothing but torture-pron. This means that torture, suffering and confusion is the main point of the film. The only thing in doubt is whether the ""philosophical"" issue has been added to pretend like it's a real movie, or if it was added intentionally to try and ""get away with it"".",2009
1,"This movie expects the audience to be retarded like Lucie to believe what's going on. SPOILER ALERTS! I do agree that the Lucie is mentally challenged, however her friend Anna seems to act very adult and responsible. Apparently that is quite opposite of what is portrayed by her actions. ",2011
