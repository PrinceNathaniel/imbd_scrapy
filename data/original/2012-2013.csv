4,ARROW ,2015
5,The first 2 seasons of the show was amazing however after that it got stale and boring. I decided to give up less than half way through season 5. The flashbacks become uninteresting. The villains after 2 seasons are boring. Love story is soap opera material. Season 4 made the show unrealistic with the sci-fi magic. Arrow was more interesting when he was working alone without any sidekicks.,2017
3,"I have tried and tried to love this show, as I was a long time DC fan, but boy does the writing leave a lot to be desired. Great cast, I don't blame them. The star is impressive, super beefcakey for the girls I guess, really impressive climbing pull ups... the overview is good... vigilante story turning a corner. ",2016
3,I love superhero movies...I mean love em...I love Marvel and DC movies I do not have a favorite between the two I just love em both. I haven't read any comic books so I have to research origin stories and stuff. With that being said..,2017
1,"I'm not sure why Arrow has an 8.1 rating, pretty high for an overly boring, almost laughable show.",2015
1,"What started as a promising show years ago, is now complete garbage. They all died and they all come back to life. Its like watching a Spanish tevenovela. And the flashbacks from the island, oh man. So bad i wanna cry. The Oliver Queen character is progressing same atm and on the island. And it doesn't even make sense. The parts with magic are so confusing, they tried to fill the gap with flashbacks from the island but its just so f bad. Also the magic effects look like something from a kids show like power rangers. I really cant find a good aspect of this show. And i tried so much to do so. This season will be my last, cause id be taking this show of my list. For the end sorry that my garbage English has the same quality as this show.",2016
1,"Do yourself a favor and avoid this sh.. show. Everything about Arrow is bad. Acting, directing, story, dialogs, writing, Katie Cassidy, Katie Cassidy and her half expressions and Katie Cassidy. Ah, I almost forgot to tell how bad Katie Cassidy is. She really sucks at acting. Or she is super talented at acting like a girl who cannot act. But it's a fact that she makes this show more painful to watch.",2014
1,"Most overrated show I've seen, ever.",2014
2,"I really do not understand how this show has an 8.1 average. Sometimes it is so difficult to fathom how the writers came up with such a clichéd TV series. Now don't get me wrong, I am all about clichés and cheesy dialogues but this show has taken all of those aspects to a whole new level with an extra strong added ingredient of ""stupid"".",2015
3,"Yesterday I turned off Arrow, Season 3 episode 20, before finishing it. I couldn't bear it any more. The horrible storyline has no end. What could have been such a good show, has been ruined by extremely bad writing, which also in turn makes the actors look bad. The story is so unbelievably stupid, and I don't get why it can attract so many viewers each week. The first season of arrow was quite alright. The 2nd started to introduce some strange sh*t, which didn't really make sense, and it was like they were already running out of ideas (But at least they killed of Sarah, which was a horrible character). This 3rd season has just been nothing short of a nightmare. They are just ruining the show, and I wouldn't be surprised if it gets canned. This Rha's al Ghul bullsh*t, has been going on for far too long. Also, How can they keep going back to that sh*tty Island, it's beyond me. And please, why does every person in the show needs to be a vigilante and a master kung fu fighter?",2015
1,Any one who read DC comics will tell you Green Arrow is a poor mans Batman so to speak... That being said. With all the copy-write garbage I am sure it is easier to get rights to make a green arrow show rather than a new batman show... This still doesn't excuse how horrible this thing is. A friend referred it to me as a great show with the Flash in it. They don't cover the Flash at all really. Just a short cameo with normal Barry Allen. I would encourage you to watch a daytime soap opera then watch this garbage and tell me the difference. The acting is horrible. The writing is so awful that it must be done by drunken monkeys. They randomly put a villain in the clock tower and Arrows crew wonders where he is. They should just move their headquarters there. If they ask Laural one more time IS SOMETHING WRONG i will punch my TV.,2014
3,"(This review is written after having seen episodes 1-6 only) Who the hell decided to give the green light for this series in this state? Honestly, the people who made this must have never read a comic book in their lives.",2012
2,"This show is bad, period. The only reason is watched it is so that I can bitch about it. It has characters and scenes ripped out of Batman Begins. Come on, with all that budget, you could have at least made an effort. Batman and Robin with Adam West was more entertaining and one could argue, more genuine. They had the formula, they knew they were being cheesy and they knew they were making it for kids. Sold. But Arrow is as lame as they come.",2013
6,"I really liked the first season of Arrow. It was a dark show about ""superheroes"" wandering the street and delivering justice. It was something that Smallville could not be. Grounded, believable. Had some of the soap opera feel, but it was toned down to an acceptable level. After the first season many of the better parts including the high body count started to retreat into the background. I always held Flash to a lower standard due to its more ""One Tree Hill"" approach to the story, but ultimately as of the time of my writing Arrow hit the all-time low for me, as I am now struggling to watch it while I have a decent time with the latest episodes of the speedster. Unfortunately, I do not think Flash got smarter or better, it is just the fact that it is consistent, I always get the stuff that I expect. I have to look away when those cheesy moments come up. In the fourth season of Arrow they introduced supernatural elements to the story. Seems like they needed something like meta-humans to stay attractive. While I am mostly settled with the presence of Damian Darhk, I cannot fathom the fact that they are resurrecting long dead people. Resurrected story lines are almost as ridiculous as the fetish to make everyone related to the main characters meta-human, a criminal or just simply not normal. I understand that these shows are for young adults basically, but I still cannot believe that something should be this much predictable and stupid. Also, the new island stuff is laughable, it does not add anything valuable or new. And of course they needed to write the now canceled Constantine into the show.",2016
2,"There's a whole lot I really love about Arrow. Unfortunately, the writers continue to dilute the greatness with feeble clichés and annoying, character-breaking contrivances. These keep Arrow from being the classic show it could so easily be.",2015
2,"Season 3 was mediocre, but season 4 has a huge drop in quality (shoutout to Marc ""Franchise Slaughterer"" Guggenheim). If you are a fan of the series, do yourself a favor and stop watching. The Flash is really hitting it's stride if you're desperate for CW superhero shows. This season of Arrow is just a crudely stitched together collection of tumblr fanfics. ",2016
1,"This series is so overrated , it crap , s**t p**p , so here my review I want to love Arrow, I really do.",2015
1,"Is it just me or this series is just going down the drain, every character is getting awfully WHINY as each episode is completed..... If it goes at the same rate, this show will probably take the honours of he WHINIEST show out there... When the show started off I thought it was just Laurel, but it was understood as almost every story out there has to have someone like that to make sure a segment of viewers stay interested. But then there was Thea.... even that was agreeable to a certain extent as she's a confused just out of teens kid. But then somehow the Lead character Oliver begins to whine about everything happening in the city is his mistake instead of doing what he was supposed to do ... WTH!!!!",2014
1,Save yourself the time with this one unless your less than about 12 years old or have a very low IQ.,2013
3,hahahahhahahah! this is the most original thing i've seen in the past years! if only it were a comedy/parody ...,2013
5,"The first two seasons of Arrow were brilliantly done. The cinematography was illuminating, and it had a good plot. Somewhere along the line, though, the writing went south, and I know where we can point a finger to: Marc Guggenheim. It's bad enough that he killed off Laurel, but apparently, he wants another to take up the mantle. Rather than giving it to her Earth 2 counterpart, like any ordinary writer does, he gives it to a character named Tina Boland, whose real name is apparently Dinah Drake. Never mind that the real Dinah actually appeared before, and that she was Laurel's mother! I swear, I don't know how in the world these writers are able to find jobs. They suck at it. Then there's the Felicity relationship. Not a bad character, but when you focus on shipping these two together, when clearly, within the comic books, Green Arrow and Black Canary are an item from day one! And she constantly makes some of the most bone headed plays, yet Oliver never calls her out for it. He's such a wuss. He's not Green Arrow. Green Arrow is funny, witty and doesn't mope around. Stephen Amell is a good actor, but they should have stopped the whole Batman persona around Season Two or Three. They had a chance to make things right with Season Four, yet they come away from that one even worse. And they didn't even know who was going to end up in the grave. Really? You threw the grave plot line out there, without knowing WHO was going to end up in it? To this day, I still say William, Oliver's son, should have been the one who died. This would have made his fight against Damien Darhk much more personal. In fact, who wouldn't have wanted him to die? John Barrowman is a good actor, but they've lost all use for him. Oliver's excuses for letting him live fall flat when he sold out his son in exchange for protection. To me, that's unforgivable. I'm sorry, writers, but you have failed this show. If you want to keep me interested, fire the show-runners. Better yet, cancel the show, before you make things much worse.",2017
7,"As much as I like DC and green arrow, I don't like arrow anymore. The first season was great. It set a dark and gritty tone with a grounded characters and plot points. But then in season two it started turning into what was basically Batman. Oliver queen is supposed to be witty and light hearted (I know not every incarnation is but the most common personality portrayed in mainstream comics) yet he manages to come as close to batman as possible, with his voice changer, his tall brooding status and many other batmanesque features. his normal voice sounds so bland and depressing and in later seasons they directly rip off batman stories and moments such as the shirtless fight with ra's al ghul. Talking about Ra's, you'd think when you introduce a character that you would have every other character pronounce their name the same way, yet half of the characters pronounce Ra's differently to the other half and it gets incredibly confusing for the audience and that sparks arguments between fans. Another character that annoys me in the latest season is felicity. After listening to the fans with their ""olicity!"" Chanting the show finally got the two characters together. Then Oliver's voice changed. Stephen Amell literally changed his voice because his character was happier. Seriously. As much as I like Stephen as a person, he is a pretty bad actor. Back on to felicity. She started out great, tech genius, witty, smart. But now she has broken up with Oliver because he was protecting his son after she told him she understand why he lied to her about his son. So straight from being OK with it to leaving him. Oh sorry I almost didn't mention the fact that felicity was wheelchair bound. For two episodes. Probably why I forgot. They made a big deal about it and then literally the next episode gave her a way of regaining her ability to walk. So now she can walk again. Good for her. The only character that I like on the show is diggle. He is a great realistic character. Ramsey is a great actor and is the only thing that compels me to keep watching. That and the fact that I'm a sucker for comic book TV even if it's bad. Laurel can be whingey although she has redeemed herself a little. Sara got killed off but oh look she is alive again. The annoying Thea that is always complaining was killed off but oh wait she is alive again. The big bad Malcolm Merlyn was killed off, but oh...wait he's not dead! Seriously the only major characters to die and not come back...yet, are tommy and the Queen siblings mother. This adds to felicity being able to walk again. They are teasing the death of a character for the end of the season. The only characters that will impact the fans of the show would be felicity (my personal favourite to die), Diggle (I will quit the show if this happens), Thea (wouldn't mind not hearing her constant whining) and that's about it. Otherwise it'll just be a character no one gives a damn about. Then everyone wants Stephen to be part of the DC cinematic universe? Can they not see how unbelievably b grade this show is. It would be another level of bad if they put him in the movies. I prefer flash a and actually enjoy the show as there a more good actors like Tom Cavanagh but again Gustin wouldn't make it far in movies. As much as I don't like arrow I will probably keep watching it (unless they kill diggle, to be fair he'd probably come back three episodes later) but even though I watch it I don't believe it's a good show. It's had its moments but now it's just turned into a crappy love story for Oliver and felicity. Thanks for reading.",2016
3,"Of all 3 series of superheroes Arrow, Flash and Daredevil it comes in second for my taste Daredevil is the best of the 3. Arrow gets so stupid for a superhero character , guy goes on a boat with his girlfriend sister, comes back and his best friend is on a relationship with his ex girlfriend, Oliver gives an advice to his friend to fight for the women he loves but that same night sleeps with the girl and off course his friend cries but doesn't give up his secret, then sister comes back from death sleeps with her,and he also slept with the daughter of an enemy with his CEO. His mom is all about protecting her family but kills her husband and laurel character so stupid. I gave 3 because the guy from Flash and his love life its more stupid. Action is good they just should stick to it.",2015
9,"I am bi-polar. I have been that way since I was a young man. I am approaching 60. I have been in treatment for many years. There have been relapses and time spent in hospitals. There have been good times. Before I received good treated, I left a trail of emotional, professional, and relational disaster behind me. It broke apart the lives of others as much as it did my own.",2012
8,"Greetings again from the darkness. The film is exactly what you would expect from a screwball romantic comedy steeped in drama based on bipolar disorder, depression, OCD, Philadelphia Eagles fanatics, a ballroom dancing contest, adultery, Hemingway, and a lead character who jogs while wearing a trash bag. Maybe not exactly what you would expect, but more likely much more.",2012
3,"I wanted to like this movie, I really did. I had read about the plot and its depiction of mental health issues and I was hoping to see a wonderfully nuanced movie with people fighting to get well. Instead, this movie was clichéd and clumsy. It was a movie without direction, it had no playbook.",2012
10,"At first glance, you would think this movie would be just another generic Katherine Heiglesque rom-com that dominates the box office and empties your soul. But classifying it as such is like saying Jaws was a nice little fishing movie. It's so very much more and what makes it all the more wonderful is that it comes as such a pleasant surprise.",2012
8,"While most romantic comedies usually contain bad acting, sappiness, and a large amount of predictable moments; Silver Linings Playbook is the exact opposite. There may be a little amount sappiness in this movie but there is bound to be some in any romantic situations. In reality though, all of the sap in Silver Linings Playbook can be overlooked due to the fact that the film is completely original, extremely funny, and contains outstanding acting from the two lead roles.",2012
6,This is my 1st review because I had to say something about this movie just to warn others about it since there are so many 10 star reviews. I sincerely do not understand what it is the academy saw in this movie to nominate it for 8... EIGHT Oscars! Are they paying them to nominate the movie?? 1. Bradley Cooper is not convincing as a bipolar patient. When I look at him all I can think of is his character from The Hangover or that he was voted Sexiest Man Alive. 2. Jennifer Lawrence is becoming one of my favorite ladies in Hollywood but she definitely was cast wrong for this part also. She is mean and unlikable and overacts the entire time. Just a lot of yelling and stomping around. 3. The entire movie they just bicker and huff and puff. They aren't cute until the very end and then the movie just ends. 4. There were so many football references and talking over one another that my ears started to hurt. The scenes would drag on with just arguing. 5. The plot was very bland so you aren't really rooting for anyone or excited about what is going to happen next. The script must have been a piece of cake to write because there really isn't anything groundbreaking here. There are hundreds of mental patient movies.,2013
2,"How do I find a bookie like the idiot played by Robert De Niro, who co- stars in the surprise hit movie Silver Linings Playbook?",2013
10,"I don't even know where to begin when it comes to this film. First of all, I think it's about time I profess my love for David O'Russell because he keeps making movies that I simply can't get enough of. If there's one thing I've learned this year when it comes to movies, it's find a director you love and follow him or her blindly. There's styles you'll love, and styles you'll hate, find the ones you click with and never let go.",2012
10,"I saw this at the Hamptons International Film Festival as the Spotlight film and it was one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is so relatable, even if you don't suffer from the same afflictions as the main characters, and its implications are so far-reaching that everyone, I believe, can learn a little something from Pat and Tiffany. The story sends such wonderful messages about finding the ""silver lining"" and is uplifting, even in the seemingly most dire circumstances. Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper are phenomenal, and I found myself really attached to their characters. This is a must see for everyone! And I will be seeing it again when it hits theaters in November.",2012
5,"First of all I want to say I really wanted to like this movie. I know it's a romantic comedy and it's not my favorite thing to watch but it has its moments. The trailer of this movie made me really want to watch it, a story about two depressed people whom meet up. As a person who has been depressed and suicidal for a large part my life this movie seemed like something that could bring up the frustration of being depressed and mentally ill. But was it? No, not at all. It made it a silly and meaningless plot point and it dumbed down feeling mentally ill to a small thing that doesn't matter and everyone can get over it in easy if they just want to. ",2013
1,"Over the past week I believed I had seen the most overrated film currently frontrunning the Oscars this year after viewing ""Zero Dark Thirty."" And then I discovered this abomination.",2013
5,"After a great beginning, describing pretty realistically the condition of a person with a mental disorder (in this case bipolar), the movie fails completely in the last 30 minutes, where the main character suddenly gets over his obsessions and finds true love, his family wins a lot of money and his friends manage to solve their emotional and mental problems in order to celebrate the happy-ever-after couple.",2013
3,"Just got back from theater with my wife and had to write.. My top genre is rom coms and i can enjoy the lamest and most predictable, but this is a real stinker. I can't believe people clapped at the end, morons. Other negative posts are right on editing, poor story line with weak motivations, but the killer for me was ZERO chemistry between Lawrence and Cooper. This movie never figured out what it wanted to be: comedy, quirky love story, family healing story, concern for the mentally or emotionally ill, Benny and Joon? I think they never figured it out or planned well so they threw it all in. ",2013
2,"I really wanted to LOVE this movie, as I rarely get out to watch movies so I am very selective about the ones I will go watch. I love both Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence and the reviews have been so overwhelmingly positive I was sure I couldn't lose!",2012
1,"Thought I would enjoy this film, unfortunately I didn't. You could see from a mile away that the main character was going to end up with the other women(yawn, seen this in other films). It was too long, well it felt like it for a 2 hr film, it kind of dragged on and on, and was hoping for the end to arrive. Deniro has done better work than this, Jacki weaver was good, and deserves the Oscar nom for her role, as for Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, there was NO chemistry between the 2 leads, I thought His character was going to end up with his wife(ex-wife in the film), would of been interesting if they had of gone this way instead of the predictable outcome. Long on fluff, short on substance is Silver Linings Playbook.",2013
2,"Sorry to bring the joy down people, but I've been wasting my time for the last 2 hours... When you watch the trailer, you do know what to except of the basic story, the funny/weird romance, etc... what you don't know is how slow & weak the action & dialogs take place. It is so painful to see good actors led to play in such a disastrous direction. Main characters seem to play a caricature of a mentally ill person like ""cuckoo's nest"" basic redux, poor deniro seems to be stuck in the role of the good old grumpy/lovely dad/step dad for the last decade now. Actors are plainly hysterical, going in circle for the whole movie. I couldn't relate, not one bit. When you go to tragi-comedy genre, you expect to get emotionally involved, I was clinging to my seat after an hour trying to figure out if i had to laugh cry or just get out of the room... The staging & editing is extremely weird but not in the good sense. I wont mention about the American sport community thing, though it made them look all the more pathetic (ok i just mentioned it). Terrible. The last movie -and they are few -that gave me that feeling of total emptiness was ""How Do You Know"", boy i had hoped it would never happen again... well it is !!!",2013
1,This movie was built up to be one of the best of the year. It couldn't have fallen shorter in my opinion!,2013
2,Dancing with PTSD,2013
1,"So, the acting in this film is excellent and that's why the one star. Other than that, this is a hot mess of a movie in terms of any sense of reality, common sense, and human behavior.",2013
1,"Wow, talk about a movie written to a well-worn Hollywood recipe.",2013
1,"I expected this movie to be really good. Something else than the usual Hollywood stuff. The beginning was in line with the expectations. Looked promising, but that soon disappeared and eventually it was hard to watch the movie at all, but I did it, sometimes looking away. Especially the scene were almost everyone is in the house of the parents and they are talking about the bet that went wrong and what to do next. This scene really went wrong and there seemed nothing to do about it, but close my eyes and look away. The movie really collapsed there. The remaining of the movie was exceptionally predictable. I even got the jury-score right. Afterwards I couldn't think of any reason for this movie to be made except making money. The 8 here/92% (!) on rotten must be on a scale from 0 to 100/1000. Safe yourself the trouble, don't believe the hype and skip this one. It's a mixture of scenes from a lot of movies which never becomes 1 movie.",2013
10,"I was fortunate enough to make it into the Austin Film Festival screening of this film, and my god it was worth the wait. David O. Russel has outdone himself with this beautiful portrayal of a dysfunctional family searching for a way to come together. Bradley Cooper has won me finally with his odd and hilarious character. Jennifer Lawrence is dashing as ever with the hysterical role of Tiffany, a depressed woman trying to find a way out of her issues. This whole film has powerhouse performances, a laugh-out-loud script with heart, and a way to get the audience attached to its likable characters. I definitely recommend this film to everyone, and you are sure to see this as Osacr buzz.",2012
1,"One star because zero stars isn't an option, nor is a black hole icon. I should know better than to dis this film, as most films I hate only draw comments from idiots. But for the sheer pleasure of it, I'll say this: I hated the writing, the acting (especially deNiro, who has been doing this same role for at least ten years and has apparently abandoned the use of his talent, and his wife-character), the characters themselves, the directing, the cinematography, the casting, the scenic design and the overall conception - where a ""silver lining"" is imposed on the story rather than grows out of it. I didn't find a single scene emotionally believable, felt the script demeaned mental illness, thought the film pandered to blacks, sports, dancing-with-the-stars fans, Philly itself, endorsed gambling, rewarded incredible stupidity and risk-taking (deNiro's character is willing to throw away his entire family's future based on nothing other than an idiotic hunch by a sexpot) while the film pretends to endorse other ""moral"" life choices, thought the entire film depended on ""cute"" writing and cliché (where plot is a substitute for canned laughter), and that it was predictable after the first ten minutes. By the way, the audience I was with, maybe 50 people, didn't laugh that much. What's not to hate? Over many years I've learned that many people often think something is funny if someone else tells them it's supposed to be. I'm not one. Now go ahead and trash me if you like. But if I can keep one person from seeing it I'll have done my duty. And if one other IMDb reader has the guts to agree with me: brother, (or sister) - welcome to the real world!",2013
10,"Not being a huge fan of superhero movies, I didn't have much expectations for Batman Begins. However viewing the 2005 Christopher Nolan production, I was pleasantly shocked. Then after my huge expectations for, ""The Dark Knight"", Christopher Nolan blew my expectations to the dust. Will the same happen with the 3rd and last film, ""The Dark Knight Rises""? Quite simply, Yes! My big expectations were once again, blown away. What a production! This is a true cinematic experience, to behold. The movie exceeded my expectations in terms of action, and entertainment. The editing, sound, score, visuals, direction and action are all top notch. ",2012
1,"I'm not one for writing reviews, but the positive response this movie is getting makes me uneasy. I'm really worried about the general population. ",2012
2,"Don't waste your money, The Dark Knight was terribly awesome, every scene in that film as stand alone is better than this film. ",2012
1,"I'm starting to suspect there's some mass cultural delusion effect at work here, and in a few decades time people will come to realise that it is, in fact, just about as bad as a film can be and is easily the weakest of Nolan's Batman trilogy. Let's explore why.",2012
1,"What makes things worse, is that its predecessors were basically intricate works of genius, but TDKR lacks essentially everything that made The Dark Knight (particularly) one of the greatest superhero movies ever produced.

2,"That was the exact sentiment I had after watching TDKR. I had been waiting for this movie ever since the first teaser trailer was released.

1,1. This movie is almost 3 hours long. Out of this 3 hours Batman was sick and crippled 2 hours. He was in his batman suit and did his batman stuff 15 minutes.,2012
1,"i cant believe that some people are giving 10 rating for this pretentious,boring film.some are blinded by the hype and mass hysteria.even though they feel the movie boring,they are not willing to accept it.the guy who sat beside us in the theatre fell asleep halfway through the film and after the completion of film,he woke up and clapped.lol.all they want is part of batman patron and feel cool about it.coming to the film,its a rip-off of Bond film 'The World is not Enough'. In both films, the innocent woman is ultimately revealed to be the true mastermind/villain and the ""monstrous villain"" works for her out of devotion. Both are also willing to sacrifice themselves for love. Not to mention Bane was very much like Renard (villain from TWINE): a single named, intelligent anarchist terrorist with super strength due to a disorder, and we are led to believe throughout the bulk of both films that Bane and Renard are the masterminds behind the plot. Then there's Miranda Tate and Elektra King; beautiful,foreign businesswomen who deal in global energy.Both earn the trust of the hero (Bond/Wayne) while becoming romantically involved with them, though it's all a part of their plan to use the hero's company (MI6 and Wayne Enterprises) to her own ends. The plans are basically the same as well: steal reactor- nuclear material with the goal of nuking an entire city (Gotham and Istanbul). Another leading lady who is foxy at first and helps the hero later.character Q - Lucius fox with gadgets,M - alfred.Just added the holy drama stuff like depressed,burdened,not so-heroic Batman and hope for the city blah..blah.the icy post-apocalyptic,anarchy episodes are boring.there are many plot-holes and logicless scenes like taking a big city as hostage for months",2012
6,I came out with slight disappointment after watching DKR for I had huge expectations from Nolan after an exceptional TDK.,2012
1,"After seeing and liking the first and the second part of this trilogy, the third came off as a disappointment. There are only a few things that actually work in this movie - Hathaway an Levitt gave very nice performances, and were convincing despite of the ludicrously cliché lines they were given. Before seeing the movie, I presumed that (based on the reviews I had read) they had only minor roles, but the two of them guide the plot. Also some action sequences were well executed. But only a minority of them. The majority was illogical and confusing. In comparison with the second movie which I found to be, in its core ( even with the occasional shabby lines), an intelligent and elegant movie, this one lacks action. Of course that a movie shouldn't be judged by the amount of action, but in lack of it there must be a good storyline. This movie has none. Its plot is full of gaps, frustratingly illogical. One of the things that induced from me a great snore was the jail and childwhoescaped subplot. The idea of the jail is absurd. Whose prison is it, why are there no guards? Oh, I know it's inescapable... but please. Its location is outside of some ancient city walls, but very near it, and a modern complex is build only yards away (you can see it on the edge of the screen when Bruce escapes – but I will get to that). Bane (the Big Bad of the movie) escorted Bruce to the Asian jail himself, made all that way just to tell Bruce that he will torture his soul, and went back to Gotham, in the US, in the matter of hours. Why making that journey? It's impractical as hell. Furthermore, the man in prison, who are paid by Bane to keep Bruce alive (the man actually uttered the line – I'm paid more to keep you alive, when Bruce asked for death), are helping him fix his dislocated spine (no, it's not broken) and escape. Why? After a few tries, Bruce manages to climb the well and emerges on the surface. He throws some big, fat rope back in the pit. Where did that rope come from? Was it left outside just in case someone climbed to freedom so he can free all the other prisoners? Bruce himself had no rope – that was the whole point. Is the prisoners safety rope actually tied at the surface? If so, why no one climbed the rope itself? Hell, my brother with whom I watched the movie actually thought that he threw down the safety rope to make sure nobody else would escape. Then Bruce, with no money, no passport and no knowledge of the native language returns in the terrorist occupied and military guarded Gotham. He also, at the time, has no Batmobile, Batcopter or any other Bat-based vehicle. How did he get into the city? Fortunately, once in the city, he found his Bat-copter lying on the roof of a middle-height building, a huge thing covered only with a nett, and visible from air. With all the riots in the city, is it possible that nobody had stumbled upon it? Also, once in the Bat-copter, he encourages the not-long-ago buried police forces (who all have clean clothes and are clean-shaved after being underground for months) to attack the terrorists, but instead of helping them by shooting the enemy from air superiority, he lands the Bat-copter and seeks Bane for a fistfight. Is this not idiotic? The only action scene that was good was the one after the stock-market attack when Batman made a dashing escape. But, not even this scene can be compared with the ones from the second movie which were thrilling, masterfully directed and longer. They were also simpler, there was no atom bomb, there were just guns and explosives, but it worked better, it was more realistic, and darker. Unfortunately, what replaced action is load of parapsychology, the endlessly recycled story of the orphan Bruce, with many annoying flashbacks from previous films. You know the movie is not doing well when there are flashbacks involved. What got on my nerves a lot was also that all lectured Bruce, the man who sacrificed everything to help Gotham and do good. Alfred was particularly pathetic. Bane is truly a poorly done movie villain. The comic book character is said to have some intelligence. This was not present here. The opening scene, the delivery of the plan of doctor Pavel's abduction: Bane has executed a pointlessly expensive and complicated operation where he sacrificed unnecessarily three of his man, chopped up a plane and then used the already seen skyhook (The Dark Knight), when he easily could have attacked the plane on land. The romance between him and Coltirald's character is also redundant. His and Cotillard's background story could have been left unexplained. Even with it, both of them lack motivation. The rest of the movie Bane makes impressive entries. Actually a lot of the movie is about walking on the street, walking through the sewage, etc. And entering rooms. The romance between Bruce and Cotillard character was redundant and not probable (I accept this only if Bruce wanted a quick shag after a long time of drought). The explosion, beside the unnerving need of certain directors to explain in word what we understood in picture (someone actually had said Explosion! after we've have already seen the mushroom), was not realistic (no waves). But, as a whole, the movie is sufferable, just don't expect anything great. The thing I hated the most is that Batman is missing from this film. Bruce was more out of the suit, than in it. Seems to me that Nolan became a little bit too cocky with all the praise for the two previous movies. It's a shame because the movie could have been a lot better if he hadn't.",2012

1,"The movie was so boring and lengthy that I considered to leave the cinema. The script was predictable at some points and the acting was so poor amongst some of the actors. Anne Hathaway was horrible, she was not convincing at all and her outfit looked like a cheap Halloween costume. Bane, the main villain of this movie was killed in a split second and everything was forgotten about him, that's it. It's like the script writers wanted this movie to end quickly as possible at this point. The actor playing Miranda who appears to be Ra's Al Ghul's daughter Talia should get the award for worst death presentation, it was some of the worst acting I have ever seen, you can tell that she is acting. It's like she is taking a nap for crying out loud. Blake who appears to be Robin gets access to the Batman cave and all the high tech stuff that is in there, but he didn't receive any training at all so he wouldn't know how to use it. Robin is just an ordinary cop in this movie with no combat skills, yet Bruce Wayne gives away the cave to him and settles down with the supposed Catwoman.",2012

1,"The characters are void of purpose most of the movie; terrible explanation of why and who are the ""people"" raising against the status quo; fighting scenes that are worst than Chinese B movies (knocking a guy out with a box is not acceptable anymore, or a dozen armed men choosing to wait those extra seconds just enough to fail and then trowing punches at the bat instead of using the guns in the first place), the whole bruce wayne goes to ""hell on earth"" prison that ends up to be a hole with a bunch of old farts where all he does are some sit-ups... come on, it's just plane wrong. But the piece de resistance is when the bat tops the line ""a hero can just be the guy who puts a coat over a children's shoulders and let's him know the world is yadadada..."". I mean, after the dark knight with Ledger, pfffff, this is simply WRONG! Oh, and the end... why make a whole plan to get the bomb to a designated place with all the work involved if all you needed to do was grab a cable and lift it to the sea? I mean, this movie is right there along Charlie's angels and stuff like that. Where's the power punch of the first two? This sucks! Big time!",2012
10,"After eight years in seclusion, Batman resurfaces to face Bane, a mastermind bent on destroying Gotham and has ties to Bruce Wayne's past. Christopher Nolan's conclusion to his Dark Knight trilogy should be treated as a wrap up rather than a third installment. Despite many new characters being introduced, even their conflicts and motives are derived from events that occurred in the previous two films. Such an approach could be seen as a weakness, since the conflict could just end up being sort of a rematch rather than moving the story forward; however, Nolan's approach works terrificly. Over an hour is shot in stunning IMAX, but the film is more touching than it is intense and that's its best quality. Hardy steps in as the genius mercenary Bane, who is slightly bigger, slightly stronger and slightly smarter than Batman, thus making him a challenge best suited for the grand finale. The Joker works best as Batman's arch-nemesis since they are polar opposites, with The Joker standing for everything Batman stands against. Two-Face works best as Batman's most tragic enemy because Harvey Dent is very much like Bruce Wayne the only difference is: Dent copes with his tragedy through revenge rather than seeking justice as Wayne did. Bane works best as Batman's most challenging villain because of his physical and mental superiority—forget the Bane you saw in ""BATMAN & ROBIN"". Nolan carefully chose all his villains in the series wisely and executed them perfectly. Hardy had big shoes to fill following Ledger's posthumous Oscar winning performance; while Bane is no Joker, Hardy does a satisfying job and should not be compared to Ledger's performance as they are completely different roles. It is Michael Caine, however, that delivers the most memorable and touching performance of the entire film. A wonderful conclusion to a wonderful trilogy.",2013
10,"After watching Dark Knight Rises I concluded that if there is anybody who can make kick-ass sequels its Nolan. The film contains everything, from brilliant acting, raw action, out of the world one-liners and amazing cinematography. It is already very hard to make a sequel for a film which was just good enough hit but to make a sequel for a film which will always be remembered as the best you have to do a very impeccable job and that is what is done in this movie. From the beginning to the end you have some very beautiful and emotional scenes like the mob fight between the police and the thugs, the rise of the Batman from the prison and the chants ""Deshi Deshi Basura Basura"" towards the end where Alfred and Bruce see each other for probably the last time and both know that he has made it.",2014
1,"My areas of disappointment : 1) Bane, 2) the threat on the city (nuclear), and 3) the Mr. Nolan's surprising lack of storytelling and bleak cinematic visual (even though he seemingly had the best filming tools to deliver so.). ",2012
10,"I had the honor of watching TDKR during a screening and was completely blown away! Christopher Nolan's third film in his Batman trilogy doesn't disappoint. The movie is incredibly well made, its huge production is quite breathtaking to view. This is a true cinematic experience, to behold. The movie exceeded my expectations in terms of action, and entertainment. The movie's score high-lites many of its incredible scenes, and at times, it takes your breath away.",2012

10,"The best thing about this movie is how satisfying it is. It doesn't leave you frustrated or confused. You can't really complain that it didn't explore certain ideas or follow through. By deciding to have an official ending to this trilogy's story, the themes surrounding Batman are very fresh. We don't know where he'll end up. It's not the same old thing about whether he can continue to be Batman or not, which was already getting repetitive in Spider-man 2. The conclusions are not as important as the feelings they invoke as they come about. Nolan is especially good at capturing the complete tension of actually not knowing what will happen and deeply questioning what you *want* to happen and why.",2012
3,"I do not know the book this movie is based on, but I sincerely hope that it is much better (and have been told that it is) than its adaptation. As it stands, the movie is a PG13 version of Battle Royale, with a hint of Running Man, a touch of Truman Show, minus any irony or humor, with a lot less gore (to keep it PG13 no doubt), and a lot more cheese.",2012
2,"So as a movie enthusiast and a Cineworld unlimited card holder i do my fair share of visits to the cinema. Of course when a film garners interest the trailers become more and more prominent; this could be said for the newly released ""Hunger Games:Catching Fire"". Constant trailers and advertisements on TV....which led me to think...well i haven't even seen the first one yet.

6,"A highly americanized version of Battle Royale, with essentially the same impossible happy ending.

2,"I have read a TON of reviews that told us this is THE THRILLER, the revolution, the super amazing thing. Basically it is only huge victory of marketing over the common sense. To say that the Hunger Games is better than Battle Royale is the same as to say that Coca Cola is better than the best French Champagne, because the Coca Cola sells more bottles and it is better known around the world. Oh, this power of marketing that sells water with sugar and forces the masses think that it is mana directly from the heavens! ",2012

6,"In the past couple of years Hollywood has piled on the films made from best sellers, from Harry Potter to Twilight. It's a safe bet for the movie makers cause if the books were read by millions (mainly teenagers) then it's likely that people will watch the film. Though the Hunger Games was a lot more serious than those two, apart from say the last 2 potter books, with a more brutal theme if not new because the successful Japanese Battle Royal was out first but Hunger Games was a best seller so Lions Gate made the film. If someone knows how to make something big out of something small that's LG. They didn't have any mega successes but that's why the made HG. First off we can thank Lions Gate for finding a good director and placing a lot of energy on finding the actors. And they got a good script written. They even paid attention to the budget. Let's talk about the story: The nation of Panem consists of a wealthy Capitol ruling twelve poorer districts. As punishment for a past rebellion, each district must provide two ""tributes"" - one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 selected by lottery (the ""Reaping"") - every year to compete in the Hunger Games; they must fight to the death in a vast arena, with the sole survivor rewarded with fame and wealth. In District 12, when Primrose Everdeen is chosen in her first Reaping, her older sister Katniss, an expert archer, volunteers to take her place. Peeta Mellark, a baker's son, is selected as the other district tribute. After the two youngsters find sponsors, train they start the HG. Where there is no friendship or innocence only survival. Though the film doesn't clear up a bunch of things, I'm guessing because of time constraints (what's with the hand signal?) they did build up a cool world. Maybe a strange communist world mixed with Rome? Despite that sometimes you can see that they should have spent more money on this or that the set and the filming is great. The atmosphere is great and the awesome music helps that too. The actors are believable, with co-stars like Donald Sutherland, Lenny Kravitz, Woody Harrelson and Stanley Tucci. And the star Jennifer Lawrence has already proved herself before this film in Winter's Bone and she didn't disappoint here either and was someone you can build a franchise on. The film can be split into two parts, I liked the first part better, the whole build up of the show. The actual game was maybe a little jolty. I didn't really get the ""there can only be one"", animal, killer instinct feeling as their motivators, and I thought there would be more blood, sweat and one on one fights. They probably tied the directors Gary Ross' hands to tightly, because unfortunately watching what rating it got was important plus if you want more blood watch Battle Royal or the Running Man. All in all you can really feel that LG did everything to make something good out of a book from a recycled story, they were paying attention to how much they could potentially make from the franchise. This worked through most of the film but by the end I just thought it was a good job, but it still is good to see that a YA book adaptation can be done well. I give it a 6/10 with the side note that if you want to see genius watch Battle Royal. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tg0FxMyBLP8",2014
7,"Last night I finally saw ""The Hunger Games"" and I must confess it's an entertaining movie. Shades of older movies such as ""Rollerball"", ""Logan's Run"" and more recently, ""Battle Royale"" are very present in ""Hunger Games"". In a distant future North America goes through a war that leaves the nation devastated. The war was caused by internal uprising, not a foreign attack. After a lengthy war the state prevails, but much of the nation is left in ruins. As means to remember this sad period, the state organizes a reality show called 'the hunger games', where each of the 12 districts that started the revolts years ago, must submit a young boy and girl to participate in a televised fight to the death, where only one can become the sole victor. This is where this movie veers closely to the Japanese masterpiece ""Battle Royale"", with a premise very much alike.",2012
5,"Have just been browsing thru reviews for Battle Royalle and i chance upon this review and Yes, Hollywood did make a watered down version, lame.",2012
10,"To be honest, I was hesitant about this movie, mostly because it seemed like a new, toned-down version of Battle Royale. I had never read the books, but I feel that if a movie is good enough to inspire someone, then the book will be good enough to be read.",2012
3,I didn't read the book but a movie should be able to stand up on its own. But there were things that you obviously had to read the book to understand. This is a fairly boring movie about a lump of wet newspaper named Katniss who volunteers to be thrown into an arena with a bunch of other children to murder each other for the amusement of the upper class citizens. This movie doesn't rip off Battle Royale so much as it murders it and attempts to wear its skin. ,2014
6,"There's almost nothing to say about a movie like The Hunger Games -- it's been so worked to death to be a successful blockbuster that all of its edges, the things that make a film good or bad, have disappeared. It just exists as a spectacle, a finished product that defies any critical lens.",2012
7,"I am referring to the audience watching. Because the original Battle Royale (japanese movie) with a similar theme, was more of an adult version of this movie right here. Having said that, the idea is so good it translates to the screen, even if it is watered down a bit. Plus I was just enjoying the girls moaning and exhaling in general while watching this and finding romance even in the weirdest of situations. Throw in Lenny Kravitz, Elizabeth Banks and the always reliable Stanley Tucci for some acting/weirdness weight and you got yourself a movie.",2012

1,"How is movie about teenagers battling to the death not going to actually show any of the killing?! I paid more attention to it the second time watching and realized that every time someone dies the movie goes silent and cuts away. There is actually only one killing death shown, and it's by accident. The movie did do a good job at not making that noticeable, but it's still a big flaw. And also, why do the tributes have to be teenagers? There was no explanation to that at all. I hope the book explained that somewhat. I thought the end of the tournament was ridiculous. First there could only be one winner, then they announce there can be two, then psych, there can only be one, and then the last two are going to commit suicide, so the government decides two is fine again. If you want to see a far superior movie with practically the same plot then watch Battle Royal. It's subtitled, but it's mostly action anyway so that's not a big deal.",2014
1,"I have never felt so cheated by a film in my life. This film was advertised as America's answer to Battle Royale.

The movie features an ensemble cast that includes Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddleston, Clark Gregg, Cobie Smulders, Stellan Skarsgård, and Samuel L.

1,"Have movies become so bad these days that a merely well-executed totally formulaic film, like ""The Avengers,"" is heralded as an exceptional film?",2012
10,"I'm sorry to say The Avengers isn't a good movie; it's a GREAT  MOVIE!!!! It's not only the best team superhero movie ever made, but it  may just be the best comic book adaption made period!  The Avengers is the culmination of what began in Iron Man; and  continued through The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain  America. It was only a few years ago that my son and I had just  finished watching Iron Man and as the credits were ending, Samuel L.  Jackson appeared on screen as Nick Fury and spoke to Tony Stark about  joining Avengers Initiativein that short scene, the framework for  potentially the greatest comic book movie of all-time had begun!   Director Joss Whedon, most known for the T.V. series Buffy The Vampire  Slayer, takes the foundation that was built in the prior films and  brings together the greatest team of superheroes in film history, The  Avengers: Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain  America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk/Bruce  Banner (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye  (Jeremy Renner) as ""assembled"" by Nick Fury. Whedon's scripts usually  include clever banter, gripping action sequences and an air of mystery  and The Avengers is no different. Whedon has an utter love for comic  books, and it is proudly put on display in The Avengers.  The cast does a great job of bringing these iconic characters to life,  beginning with Robert Downey Jr. Unlike Iron Man 2, in which Downey  seemed to skate through scene after scene, Downey plays Stark almost  effortlessly, delivering his lines with relative ease allowing his  charisma, charm and smugness to shine through; Robert Downey Jr. IS  Tony Stark! Chris Evans' solidifies himself in the role of Captain  America. He was very good in his solo film, but truly owns the role  standing alongside Iron Man and Thor. Chris Hemsworth's Asgardian god  Thor has some incredible battle scenes and indirectly provides one of  the film's most funny moments. After being seriously underutilized in  Iron Man 2, Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow is provided a back-story,  which helps in developing the character and provides an opportunity to  prove she is much more than just a pretty face; she's as dangerous  psychologically as she is physically. I could envision myself enjoying  a beat-down at the hands (and feet) of Black Widow. The character I was  most concerned about being given little story and the least amount of  screen time was Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye; happily, he's not left by the  wayside and does a more than admirable job of developing the character.  Hawkeye stands alongside Robin Hood and Katniss Everdene (The Hunger  Games) as the best archers to grace the silver screen. I'd like to see  more of him in a film of his own. Mark Ruffalo, the most recent choice  to play Hulk, is far better suited to the role than Eric Bana (The  Hulk) and Ed Norton Jr (The Incredible Hulk). Ruffalo looks more the  part of the nerdy scientist Banner and plays the part without looking  angry in every scene. In The Avengers, the Hulk is at his most  impressive, both in his on-screen transformation and the violence he  displays when the opportunity calls for him to ""hulk out"". If any  character appeared to stand out a little bit more than the others, for  me it was the Hulk. Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury is finally more than  just the guy making surprise appearances. Fury is finally able to  stretch his legs some, and Jackson slides quite easily into the role.  Clark Gregg's Agent Caulson returns, and Cobie Smulders makes her  Marvel films debut as Agent Maria Hill, and she is a welcome addition.  The film's main villain is Thor's adopted-brother Loki, played by Tom  Hiddleston. You would think the part would be a difficult one to play  being opposite such powerful personalities and strong characters, but  Hiddleston does a fantastic job; the performance should not go  unnoticed, because it's one of the strong points of the film. Loki is  not a villain without purpose and Hiddleston comes across as a devious  mastermind without being cartoonish.  At a running-time of 2+ hours, The Avengers is well paced and time  flies by. The effects are top-notch, the acting is very good, and the  script drives the movie elevating its strengths. For viewers that may  not have seen any of the other films (and if so, why not!?!?), we're  provided just enough information to bring everyone up to speed without  feeling overdone. Whedon provides more than just a standard comic book  film, but a story with reason that's backed up with incredible action  and humor.   Although the film is filled with larger than life characters, none are  short changed; each character is given at least one great scene to work  with, and the opportunities don't go to waste. The film's finale  provides a deafening crescendo of action that is breathtaking. As usual  with Marvel films, be sure to stay around for the post credit sequence,  which provides a surprising reveal.  I went into The Avengers with unfairly high expectations, due to all of  those that were involved, as well as the films that came before it.  After viewing the initial trailers and not being blown away, I had set  myself up for disappointment. It was only a matter of minutes after the  film started that I was put at ease, and just minutes later when my  expectations were blown away. I never imagined that it was possible to  put onto the screen, what I was watching. I'm happy that Marvel had the  sense to keep these properties to themselves and to move forward with  these characters in the manner in which they did. Marvel Studios and  Disney are going to make a boatload of money off this film, and  deservedly so; because there's never been another movie made of its  caliber.  Grade: A+",2012

2,"I don't want to waste more time talking about a movie that I just wasted 2 1/2 hours of my life watching but I feel it's necessary in order to maybe save someone from making the same mistake I just did by watching this stinker. Actually I slept through some of it so there was SOME valuable time spent in the theater. I would have walked out except my girlfriend look like she was enjoying it. This movie just sucked, plain and simple. It's the typical good guys have to save the earth from aliens. It did have all the emotions though.....The dialog was laughable and the acting made me want to cry. Unless you just like seeing buildings getting demolished and people who are impervious to bullets, explosions, and every kind of weapon known to man, stay home and save your money. I've watched better cartoons as a kid. It actually angers me that there are so many people in this world the simply LOVED this movie. This movie was so bad, I may never go to the theater again!",2012
10,"""The Avengers"" brings together a group of extremely talented actors and epic superheroes, to create an action packed movie with hilarious banter laced into countless scenes. Superhero movies give actors a chance to play new characters with personalities they have never portrayed before. Chris Evans is the extremely passionate and kind hearted Captain America, while Robert Downey Jr is the tougher and sassier Iron Man. The film is very creative with introducing each character and later bringing them together. The villain, Loki Laufeyson, played by Tom Hiddleston, even shows his weak spots and is almost seen as part of the Avengers team. The actors have fantastic chemistry with each other on and off screen, and they make man- tights and capes look more fashionable than ever. The majority of the film is done by special effects, made by an amazing team. They transform New York City into a place for heroes, placing Tony Stark's towering house in the middle of the city. Even at the end of the film, the unsuspecting Tony Stark is willing to sacrifice himself for the good of everyone else. This is a wonderful movie to watch if you want to be thoroughly entertained while having your feeling played with at the same time.",2014
10,"After all the films leading to this one we were promised the Avengers on screen and this film gave us that big time. This film sees a group of big personalities having to come together and defeat a mad man and his army from enslaving humanity. One of the most important parts of the build up to this film was Robert Downey jnr's performance as Tony stark/iron man, and he is just as awesome in this film. His character grows in all these films but he is still the narcissist that we love. Also Chris Evans as captain America was really important as he is the leader and comes across as the moral compass of the whole film but he isn't boring which is great for the character. The rest of the performances are great as well, first of all is the recasting of Mark ruffalo as Bruce banner/hulk and he was the biggest surprise in this film. He was great in both roles and the hulk has absolutely never been better then this film. Chris Hemsworth is back as Thor and this guy is absolutely seriously movie star and makes this character a great character full of personality. Scarlett Johansson returns as black widow and she is sexy and tough while also proving that she is also the best female in these superhero films around. Samuel L Jackson is back as Nick fury and he is great as the character and squeezes the most he can out of this great character. The one member of the team that isn't really developed is Hawkeye, he isn't really himself for the most of the movie but even then the last battle he becomes great. What is important in a film like this is having a great villain and Tom hiddlestone as Loki definitely succeeds at that. He is just so fun to watch and you buy that he could pull off all this destruction. Sometimes simplicity is best for a story and this is one of those times, it has happened before that a group of combustible elements have to team up but this film gets the most out of it and adds real drama to the film. The script is the best part of the film and the dialogue between the characters is what makes this film so enjoyable to watch because it makes all the characters feel unique and there own personalities. The style of this film is great, the action is all enjoyable and the film looks great but I have to mention the show stealer that is the incredible hulk. This is the best interpretation of the hulk and he looks better then ever and he is possibly the best character in the film. Overall this is one of my favourite films ever and this is a comic book fans dream.",2014

7,"We've all seen shows that started with a very exciting pilot suffer a slow boring death. A good show needs more than a good concept at the start, it needs good storytelling, good acting, likable characters and it needs to find a good pace.",2012
8,"Wasn't perfect but no pilot is. Really enjoyed the show, we found it exciting, fast paced, without too much exposition or clumsy explaining. Liked what felt like some fairly realistic situations, hope they give the chance.",2012
10,"If you are planning on watching this show and pointing out the inaccuracies, don't watch it. This is a FICTIONAL procedural drama, not a documentary on Fire Fighters and Paramedics. Of course there will be inaccuracies, and things will be rushed to get a story told in 45 minutes. Just like there are inaccuracies in shows such as Grey's Anatomy, Law & Order, CSI...it is all unrealistic...yet that does not stop people from enjoying the show. ",2012
10,"My wife and I are hooked on this show. We have watched all of the episodes from the beginning and really look forward to seeing it every Wednesday night. The different story lines and plots are enough to keep you interested without being too dramatic. I have read many reviews that say it isn't realistic. It is Hollywood, folks - it can only be as close to real as TV allows. Get over it! I think that some of the rescue scenes are incredible. Hopefully some of the plots that were developing (like the dirty cop plot) are continued as they were great. Give this show a chance - it is like the 70's show Emergency! for 2012. If you like Law & Order then you will like this show too. It has the Dick Wolf touch that makes it a great show. We love it!",2013
10,"There's tons of cop, lawyer and doctor shows on TV and firefighters are way too under represented in TV series. Actually Chicago Fire and Rescue Me are the only full blown fireman shows that I even know it. Rescue Me was a good show but had too much Gavin family drama in sometimes. And while Chicago Fire may show a little bit of there off duty lives, most of the time the show deals with their on duty lives.",2012
10,"Good story lines without a lot of sugar-coating or fantasy. We meet characters with depth, from the token firehouse playboy to a lesbian portrayed primarily as a human (that's a TV first). Some good action/effects scenes. Eye candy for everyone. What more can you ask? I truly enjoyed this one. Watched the whole series over a 2 week period while I was sick. I'm waiting with anticipation for it to return.",2013
9,I started watching this show when this was renewed for season 2 because of it's poor season one rating. Now i know why it was not cancel after season one poor performance. It is because every script of every episodes are well crafted and has brilliant characters(not to mention eye candies for the ladies and gays) and has depth in their history. Despite it's lack of excitement and thrills in the storyline it is humbling for a show to give it's viewer a fresh and realistic drama.,2013
9,"When this show first aired, I was not interested on watching a fire fighting drama. Besides, I've been watching another Wolf Production since 1999 and that was good enough for me. However, when Chicago PD was introduced, I decided to watch it because it came on directly after my favorite show and I love TV drama series. I feel in love with Chicago PD because of the zest and criminal kick-ass and I was hooked.",2014
10,"OK. I read some of the lesser reviews but I totally disagree. I love this show and after 1 episode I was hooked! And now, seven episodes in, I'm addicted! I know that there are flaws (most medical, trauma, firefighter, cops shows have them), but I love the characters and the way the cast is really coming together. I cannot wait to see what happens next! The plot could be written in so many different ways and I can see the possibilities for this show to run for a long time. ",2012
10,I love this show!,2013
9,"Flashpoint showed the way but this delivers! Call it corny, call it contrived, I don't care. Teamwork , loyalty, unadulterated action, sub- plots... you name it -- it's all there.. This is definitely an outstanding North American TV series. (I exclude Sopranos psychology - it does not promise this, and as for The Wire? not even close. The Shield? this was a different league.) I loved 24 but, let me tell you, there's a feel good factor here that 24 could never deliver. I don't care about reality, and I can forgive the PC attempts. However, with these guys, there's still hope for the world. And on a serious note, for me, any positive promotion for fire-fighters is worth the time. Backdraft, Ladder 49, even the UK with London's Burning. For me this does the business. Watch it!...",2012
10,"Well what can I say, that hasn't been said already but I'm still going to. Simply love the show. All the leading characters are believable. They all kinda seem to make out a very good and balanced mix of strong, independent and individual enough characters. They make a good team, but also have problems of their own. They solve those in part themselves and in part through the help of their alternative CF family. Their fire squad. That brings me to the storyline. It is also very good. Not just straightforward but complex and interesting enough to just bind you to the screen. Somehow i totally like the fact, that every once in a while, we can see how the individual characters are personally involved and how they cope with the struggles of work and their personal life. And then the show being combined with Chicago PD... no words needed... I just enjoy every single episode and hope to see many more seasons of both! Thanks.",2015
10,"I love this show and I hope everyone gets to see it. I look forward to it every week. We never know what to expect from one week to the next. It has everything I love to see in a show about humanity. Every week I am surprised at what the characters have to face and the decisions they have to make. It has excitement. It's emotional, it has love, heartache, quick decisions, action, and some comedy. This shows what real firefighters have to go through daily and I appreciate everything they do. They have to deal with the same emotions the characters do on the show. There are lots of examples of anger, hurt, happiness, and sadness. Thanks for a terrific show! I hope it never ends.",2014
7,"Pros: Keeps you interested with several things going on. Fire & rescue, Ambulance EMT. Death of a fireman and lingering emotions/personalities, that follow the death of a Fire Family member. To a new hire the kid. Very attractive people. With the regular looking Jo's, to keep it real. And real life situations. One fireman loosing his home in Foreclosure, because of the economic situation. Boyfriend and girlfriend braking up Action filled drama covering all the basis. Buliding on fire, Firemen falling through the floor. Alarms on body going off, that was explained previously. When the rookie is handling grammar school children on a field trip to the fire dept. Great Job. Cons: Sirens on Fire Truck are way to loud that's all. Freddiegem",2012
9,"I've got to be honest, I first started watching the show because Chase from House was in it as Lt. Matt Casey, and Mason Lockwood from Vampire Diaries is Lt. Kelly Severide. With those two good looking guys on cast - as firemen! - I suspected I'd enjoy if only for the eye candy, but was pleasantly surprised when I found myself pulled into the storyline in the first 5 minutes, and left wanting more as the episode came to a close. From the first episode I had that feeling when you know you're onto a good thing, and I haven't been disappointed yet, needless to say It has quickly become my favorite show. Every episode follows Lt.Casey and his truck squad, Lt. Severide and his rescue squad and the two female ENTs while they fight fires around Chicago. There is plenty of fire action and tense situations to keep you interested, while the characters personal lives unfold and have as much heat as the fires they fight. This is one of those rare shows where they've managed to make the characters as interesting as their occupations. This really is a good show, men and women will like it, it's a great mix of action and drama, we see the trials and tribulations of friendship and romance at the fire house (and fighting fires of course!)",2013
5,"I love this show... lots of hot guys, but it doesn't have to be cheesy or slutty to be good.. we want to know day to day in the life of a fireman and there are much bigger story lines that the ones being put out there ... the writers are going to write themselves into a hole and I don't want this show to be canceled because again there is some nice eye candy ... as there should be. I realize that it takes time to establish characters and it will great to see them evolve. Still unsure as to how real this is as I myself have never known nor ever been a firefighter but this is a tough subject to depict and it would be very cool if a series could get into the heart of the topic.. make it believable ... I was a huge fan of Grey's but that era is over .. I want original, deep, raw, .. I want to know why each one of these characters picked fire fighting... because although eye candy is good.. the heart is better. so please no more cheese.. One more thing.. the women outside of the house are depicted as strong but unintelligent.. Redundant ... lots of blank stares .. can we look into this please??",2012
10,I love the show. I have always enjoyed firemen and parametric shows. Hopefully the show will make it. I do think its good enough. The only thing I can't stand I'd the guy with the soul patch. Really is this a future episode where they shave it off his face while he's sleeping. Please do something about that. It's out of style for one thing and he doesn't have the face for it. The girls on the show are a smart bunch which I like. Usually the girls are make to be idiots that salivate all over the place for hunk on the trucks. Please shave the starch and soul patch I begging you. It could really be a funny show. Good luck with the futures shows. I'm looking forward to see where it goes.,2012
1,"I'm a paramedic who also has had extensive firefighter training. That being said, it took about 5 minutes into the episode before I was laughing and shaking my head ""no"" as I was overwhelmed with the inaccuracies. Now I understand that it's TV so I know it's not going to be perfect. However I long had my doubts before actually watching it. The first thing that's wrong with it, is that it's on NBC, which means there's a foul language barrier. Anyone who knows real firefighters ESPECIALLY firefighters in Chicago; know that the majority of us can't say more than ten words without swearing or saying something vulgar. So the show pretty much has lost it's realism in the dialog alone. Now I don't argue that you can't make it work, because Third Watch did fine with it for a long time, however the focus wasn't only on firefighters in that show. ",2012
5,"I actually enjoyed the first few episodes of ""Chicago Fire."" But a dozen episodes into the first season, and they are devoting FAR too much time to the soap-opera side of things.",2013
10,"I have recently started watching Chicago Fire, PD and very recently Justice (only because it was introduced as part of the Chicago Fire S05E15/Chicago PD S04E16/Chicago Justice S01E01 episodes).",2017
1,"Dear Actors, Actresses, Producers, and everyone else involved with this show.",2012
1,"When I was last in the US, I had the Honour of meeting firemen/women and EMT's and this program is nothing less than an insult to the great work these people do. Anyone who has served in the military will tell you they are not a hero, but the Police, Fire and EMT's are Heroes because they go into the the fight everyday, people, everyday. Fire is the most elemental of all fears in we humans and firemen/women go into burning buildings to pull people like you and me out everyday and they do it for, let's face it cr*p money, but they still do it, because they are dedicated people who work together as a team to save lives.",2012
2,"I had to tape this pilot and just finally sat down to watch it. I totally agree with ""disgusted firefighter."" ",2012
10,"I didn't want to watch this because I adore the BBC Sherlock. However, after denying myself for weeks and weeks I decided to download the first 8 episodes and get to work watching them before I made a full opinion. ",2013
10,"I think it's very difficult for people to accept change, in any form. If this is the case for you, and you love the old style Sherlock Holmes...you'll hate this.",2012
10,"Unlike the many Sherlock Holmes snobs who have posted low-scoring reviews, I'm not going to bother with comparisons of other Sherlock Holmes connotations. It's an adaptation that puts intelligent twists to the original story and yet established itself as sufficiently well crafted to stand on its own as one of, if not, the best television series around at the moment. The acting is superb with Jonny Lee Miller, Lucy Liu, Aiden Quinn and Jon Michael Hill carrying the weekly load, with appearances from the likes of Rhys Ivans, Natalie Dormer, Sean Pertwee and even Vinnie Jones to bring some variety. The stories are dramatic, mostly unpredictable with touches of humour and draw on aspects of the modern day as to make them very interesting. I love how they explore the relationships between the characters on both sides of the law and how they deal with their demons both past and present. I find that many episodes explore the fringes of the modern world through topics covering science, computing, art, finance, etc. and this adds to the richness of the plots which, along with the writing, are the strongest aspects of the series. I can't sing the praises of this series enough.",2015
10,I am a big fan of Sherlock Holmes in practically every medium... from the works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to Basil Rathbone to Young Sherlock Holmes to Robert Downey Jr. and even the episodes in Star Trek TNG. ,2012
9,"Like many people, I love BBC's Sherlock and overlooked Elementary for many reasons. I recently decided to give it a chance and was pleasantly surprised to say the least. First off, don't make the same mistake I did and dismiss it for some of the rather odd sounding changes, it's intended to be a different spin on the classic and does so very well.",2013
8,"This purports to be a take on Sherlock, migrated to modern New York and it does this very well. Sherlock is a true eccentric, Watson equally and entertainingly odd with the NYPD reassuringly stereotypical, adding balance. Jonny Lee Millar gives consistently outstanding performances full of quirky finger movements, twitches and sudden changes of direction - mental, emotional and physical. Watson is a bewildered soul mesmerised by Holmes, resentful of his offhand treatment of her, intrigued but unable to escape. Irene likewise is outstandingly good - another flawed character, riveting to watch. This series is a revelation, worth watching for JLM's performance alone. Worth 10/10 were it not for Watson's quacky delivery and Holmes' mumbling when thinking out loud but don't let this affect your enjoyment - just see if you agree. Absolutely brilliant.",2016
9,"It is getting better as it progresses. They are moving beyond a simple police procedural. The crimes are getting more interesting. I like it. I don't compare it to the BBC Sherlock. For one thing, the latter isn't tied to the one hour episode with ads format.",2013
8,"As long time Sherlock fan of books/ Rathbone films and even BBC Sherlock, I was a little skeptical of this NY incarnation. Especially with the gimmick driven female Watson. Having watched the first few episodes however I am pleasantly surprised. The show is carried and carried well by the charisma and scruffy charm of Johnny Lee Miller, who convinces as the eccentric mental powerhouse who has his fair share of weaknesses both socially and physically. Watson does better as a woman than I would have thought and Aidan Quinn is just as brilliant as a police chief in this as he was in the undeservedly canceled Prime Suspect.",2012
8,"Okay, so this is not an American version of the Doyle classics. But it satisfies my first requirement of a good show--I like the characters. Holmes is a man struggling with his inept social skills while simultaneously reveling in them. Watson is a woman whose job has become a hobby and more. As they adapt, this could lead to more interesting interactions. The police characters are skeptical and protective of their turf, yet open to help. They grudgingly admire Holmes' results.",2013
9,"What House was to medicine, Elementary is to investigating. The writing is clever, fast paced and smart. Our eccentric lead ""Holmes"" instead of having a drug dependency for his gimp leg like House, is a recovering drug addict who is being observed by ""Watson"" to keep him clean. They writers really make an effort to spell out the deductive-reasoning details, and for the most part, its plausible, IMO. The plots snake thru twists and turns at a feverish pace and Holmes dedication is relentless. You get the feeling he behaves this way to keep him mind from allowing his addiction to regain control. Lucy Liu , who I love, is curiously restrained in her role to offset Holmes's incessant espousing. Her deductive skills are far less than Holme's but she brings medical expertise to the table. They have a unique but likable chemistry. It seems obvious to me that at some point Liu's character will be developed more and eventually Holmes is going to have some sort of relapse. I can only hope this show maintains this level of intensity without sacrificing credibility, but for now, IMO, its one of mainstream's networks finest.",2012
6,Several other posters have hit my points exactly so I will mostly just say that I agree it is a pretty good show.,2016
1,"I don't have cable, so I'm unsure whether this show is 'doing well'. I came here out of curiosity and to figure out if it was overall well-received. I know a lot of people that don't like it, but I was surprised to find so many that did. I can only assume that the people that like this show must not be familiar with Sherlock Holmes lore or if they are that they must lack basic understanding of the very mechanisms of what makes him who he is. I'll watch just about anything involving the concept of Sherlock Holmes and I do watch Elementary. In fact, I've watched every single episode since the show began, perhaps with optimism that it would improve. However, I believe I am watching it at this point only out of morbid curiosity.",2013
2,Conan Doyle's Sherlock as written in the Strand:,2013
5,"I have no problem with the cast, and though this Sherlock does not compare to BBC's Sherlock, I'm getting rather fond of the neurotic, twitchy character. Lu is wonderful, as always. What I think this show needs is better writing, before the writers destroy what could potentially be a fabulous series. This is supposed to be Sherlock Holmes, the ultimate in mystery series, and I managed to figure out the entire plot in the first 20 minutes. ""Murder, She Wrote"" and ""Castle"" had/have better writers.",2012
4,"This show isn't ""Sherlock Holmes"".... and I don't say that because of any ""reimagining"" or creative license taken with the character.",2012
5,"I used to enjoy Elementary but now I can no longer keep up with the many plots. What makes it really difficult is it seems like Sherlock and Joan are mumbling all the time. I can hear most of the other characters fine, and sometimes Sherlock and Joan come through loud and clear. But often they sound like they're speaking a different language. I've given up! I just can't stay awake and watch them anymore without fully understanding what is going on. My husband still enjoys it. He has trouble understanding what they say sometimes too. But he's continued to watch it. Hopefully the producers can fix the sound for this program.",2016
9,"The often unpleasant comparisons between British TV and American is just that, and it should be noted from the start that this show makes no attempt whatsoever to be the current American version of Sherlock with Cumberbatch and Freeman. The real question therefore is, what is it trying to be? The answer to that isn't simple because it's pilot episode received generally favorable reviews and seemed to be more thoughtful than some of the genre shows that it will be compared with as the series develops. The acting was good enough and there was a plot working, but the show never seemed to get it's legs. Miller and Liu never spark together. Though both have their moments of intensity they don't show us any proof that this is going to be a work in progress.",2012
3,"I love Sherlock Holmes; from the original Doyle books to Basil Rathbone to Benedict Cumberbatch. When I heard that they were going to do an modern American version I thought ""hmmmm"". We have to admit that the Americans do not have a great track record when it comes to remaking British television. With Elementary they continue this tradition of ""not getting it"". Why didn't they just name this series ""CSI: Sherlock""? They have reduced Sherlock to just another mindless, formulaic American melodrama. Sorry but I will not be watching another episode of this. I will wait for the next Benedict Cumberbatch episode. Three episodes a year of the Benedict Cumberbatch series is better than 20 of Elementary.",2012
1,"CBS does a dishonor to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and the stories of Sherlock Holmes in the farce of a show that should be titled ""CSI Britain: Lost in New York"". Although ""Elementary"" is an apt title due to how basic the stories and plot lines are in this show.",2013
2,"The original stories are fantastic, past adaptations have been very watchable and the most recent modern BBC revival has been a gritty adaptation. Although people surely argue about the BBC adaptation (the way it has been transposed into the modern world), it is clearly well written (some episodes better than others) and made with love for the original stories. The US version has only a single good thing going for it, it's star: JL Miller and even his performance is completely drowned out by the idiotic adaptation, his terrible to mediocre co stars and the general lack of quality in pretty much all aspects of the series. Two things absolutely integral to the character of Holmes have been scripted away with here (it is my guess that the network thought it would upset their gun-wielding, hard-core Christian viewers...well, Americans):",2013
1,"I have seen nearly every iteration of Arthur Conan Doyle's characters, ranging from the bizarre to the humorous, from the fantastical all the way to very honest renditions--and literally everything in between.",2014
2,"As crime investigation shows go, I suppose its not bad. As far as Sherlock Holmes goes, this is trash. There is nothing about this show that has any relation to Arthur Conan Doyles books other than the names of the 2 characters. This is like The Mentalist (which isn't that bad either) except the lead characters are ripped off. If this was not associated with Sherlock Holmes it would be just another crime show with a complete a**e as the hero (like The Mentalist).",2012
4,"OK, I have seen the two episodes so far, and I can say... This is a detective, who happens to be called Sherlock Holmes. But *Sherlock Holmes* he is not. Disclaimer : I am not comparing with BBC Sherlock. IMHO, if you name your character Sherlock Holmes, you must somehow respect your source material. It is not enough to use the names Sherlock and Watson. OK, now we have the violin. Of course I am not asking for the deer hat or the pipe. But to me, so far it seems more a variation of Monk instead of SH, with a sprinkle of Mentalist. I mean, please, he has a FATHER?? A brother Mycroft would have been more credible. And because he only communicates by phone, it would have been even more suitable to the reclusive books character. I have other complaints : If a show, *any show*, is boring to the verge of sleep, it's finished. And it happened to me on both episodes. I got asleep! No suspense at all. The solution for ep. 2 was obvious almost immediately. In the words of Conan Doyle : ""When you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth"". But in this case, it was almost foolish, and I am no detective. I have no complaints with the actors (I just love Lucy Liu), but I refuse to see the overall result as a Sherlock Holmes variation. It is using only the name.",2012
6,To anyone who says that Elementary is a great 21st century adaptation of the Sherlock Holmes series has not watched the BBC version with Martin Freeman and Benedict Cumberbatch. Now THAT is/was an amazing 6 episodes of Sherlock Holmes in the 21st century.,2012
10,"Considering that detective procedurals populate the British television landscape perhaps more than any other genre, one might lament at the prospect of not only another crime drama, but a prequel to one of the most beloved shows, mystery or otherwise, to ever grace the small screen, Inspector Morse. Those who might dismiss Endeavour as just another generic addition to an already overcrowded marketplace, however, would be making a grievous error.",2013
10,"Well I have just watched the second episode in the new series and was captivated again. As soon as I had finished watching I watched it again taking in all the things I had missed the first time, I have my dictionary/computer on hand to research some of the phrases and words which adds to the enjoyment. I do not listen to opera or classical music but yearn to know what the wonderful soundtrack comprises of. The characters and relationship of Morse and Thursday is captivating. This is British TV drama at its very best. I just hope it is kept real and Oxford does not become more infamous than 'Denton Woods'! The props and vehicles used during the show are amazing and really create a super feeling for the time.",2013
9,"After the surprisingly well handled one-off prequel, Shaun Evans is back as the young detective Endeavour Morse. Just like the original series with John Thaw, its success hinges on the charisma and personality of the lead character. Here Evans excels and carries the whole thing off handsomely. His performance portrays obvious knowledge and classical moral values but also an eager curiosity, drive and a naive humility which reminds us throughout this episode that he is a new recruit of sorts. The only issue I could find to quibble with is the almost Sherlockian mythology that has been added. In the original he was a knowledgeable and sharp police detective whereas here he is very much the deductive crime-fighter. As a Conan Doyle fan I do approve a little of the mythologizing but it needs to keep its roots with the original and down to earth.",2013
9,"Love this drama. Like the whole idea of a young Morse. Endeavour certainly has his detractors which have the scope to needle him because he is so junior. I suppose this is why he is so grumpy when he is older - getting his own back as it were. So plenty here to allow viewers to hark back to the original drama but also a huge amount of good coming from the new actors. From the use of typewriters to seeing lots of letters. A lack of overt violence, sex and swearing plus excellent story lines. What more can we ask?",2013
8,"While it is enjoyable in its own right, this series has not yet turned out to be a relative of Morse except in name. No stunning secrets are revealed for the fans of Morse. There are the little clues for the over-involved, but to be honest it's best enjoyed for its own sake. The most interesting character in it is Fred Thursday, and his fatherly care for young Morse is quite touching. The last episode of season 1, ""Home"" illustrates this quite nicely. Roger Allam steals the show every time! Otherwise it's pleasant to see that television is beginning to feel some nostalgia for the sixties, which are more realistically represented here than in ""Heartbeat"".",2014
10,"In my opinion they are the best English series ever! Absolutely great story lines, great actors... The Pilot episode is just wonderful. ",2016
9,"This is a far more intellectual treatment of the later Morse, or Lewis characters. The writing is excellent and doesn't try to explain more than necessary, allowing the audience to draw nearer, and in doing so, draw their own conclusions.",2014
9,"High quality television, with its strength being the re-creation of the 1960s, but with 2010s cinematic advances. The main characters are interesting and well-acted, although if you are a steady mystery viewer, you will figure out the ending very soon, which does take away from the suspense.",2015
9,"Not just a more than worthy prequel series to one of my favourite detective dramas of all time and goes very well with it, but it is a great series on its own as well, one that got off to a good start, though some of the pilot and the first episode had a still-finding-its-feet-feel (understandably), and just keeps getting stronger. It maintains everything that makes Inspector Morse so good, while also containing enough to make it its own.",2015
9,"I deeply love Morse's series, and I deeply love Lewis sequel, each in its own different way. They are two extraordinary detective shows, which I strongly recommend.",2017
8,"Scandinavian noir maybe fashionable but the writers of 'Endeavour' haven't let that bother them. This is very much in the old tradition of multiple murders solved in a Jag in between visits to choir-practice, oak-panelled pubs and sedate Oxford colleges. (It isn't true, by the way, that the students used to step over dead bodies as they went to lectures.)",2014
9,"Typically great PBS Mystery, but much better than most. Shaun Evans as Endeavour Morse, with his childlike deer in the headlights look as he detects each weekly crime, portrays the young but already very cerebral Morse whom we remember so well as an elder copper from the great 90s PBS show. Evans' as Morse, with his deceptive appearance of innocence and naivete, works through crimes with gentle but bulldog persistence until all is sorted. Roger Allam as his stoic, staid, habit-bound chief detective is also superb in his unwavering, fatherly support of Morse throughout, is always 100% credible as a mid-level Brit copper. Anton Lesser plays his daft martinet of a superintendent as not totally stupid, but he is perfectly underwhelming on purpose as Supt. Bright(hmmm)and is much more consumed with political kissing up than he is with the drudgery of everyday police work. He leaves that to the minions. All in all, great ensemble work, with very individual and unique characterizations in all roles, and I must say that I am so pleased that PBS has not fallen into the common American TV crime show trap of extending one crime into seeming infinity, week after slogging week. Thanks to this Morse, all is saved, and solved, in each show. The gorgeous and dramatic theme and various opera and classical pieces play a significant qualitative part too, as they both did in the original Morse show. Anticipate, then enjoy.",2017
10,"I have always been a great fan of the original series, featuring John Thaw as Morse. I always thought the stories were well written and televised. Which is as important. These series have me in awe. I am completely blown away. I am a great fan of the Montalbano character in the RaiUno-series. Also well written. And well televised. But this is something different. There is suspense. There is character. And there is life. I don't know how to put it otherwise. Of course we know how Morse became in his later life, but there was no history, no growing- up. These series show the growth of the character, by an actor who seems to be raised to do this. Shaun Evans does a masterpiece. I am afraid he'll be Endeavour Morse for the rest of his life.",2017
9,"After seeing the first few episodes of second series, Endeavour ranks as one of the best contemporary period police procedurals. What's striking is that relationships develop, change, and deepen between characters, beautifully understated, with emotional depth and intelligence few police series do well. It avoids the usual blokey male police culture..here I'm thinking of Red Riding 1974 ...a brutal and deeply disturbing portrait of UK police culture in the 70's and 80's. ",2016
9,"/refers to series 1 and 2/ Well, I have always been fond of British crime films, including Inspector Morse and Lewis, but usually I am not into prequels or something new created by virtue of popularity wave... But Endeavour captivated me from the very beginning: solid and distinct performances (particularly Shaun Evans as Endeavour Morse and Roger Allam as Fred Thursday, but also most in minor roles), wise and learned Oxford atmosphere, realistic overview of life in Britain in the 1960ies - to name a few...",2015
8,"I was told this was a great TV series so I started watching it. To be honest the first couple of episodes weren't catchy as I thought, probably because I wasn't used to watching more than an hour episodes, but afterwards, little by little, interest built up and I got really into it. The setting is simply great: Oxford in the 50s is just the right place to set a murder mystery series because of the College and Church buildings that convey a feeling of untold. The actors fit well their role and especially Shaun Evans is the right person to act as the young Morse for his looks of a smart and good guy, who's often referred to as ""Oxford material"". The classical music, which is the favorite by Morse, well suits the environment and the plot to which adds more drama. The screenplay is well developed and for the length and the number of crimes in each episode, it reminded me of ""The Midsomer Murders""",2015
10,"As a devotee of the original 'Inspector Morse' series, I have to say that I was less than convinced by the idea of a 'prequel' series. Thankfully, my fears were misplaced.",2017
8,I have now got up to date with this series. I have enjoyed over time the other offshoot Lewis but must say that my interest has been mostly in Hathaway and hope that it might continue along that path.,2017
9,"One or two of the other reviewers offer severe criticism based on the development of the characters in this series, as opposed to the same characters as they appear in series presenting the later phases of their lives. I think it is important to keep in mind that there are some things that viewers of MORSE will know, which viewers of ENDEAVOUR will not yet (as of 2016) have been told.",2016
9,"The show is quite a nice effort at character development. So those new to Morse, enjoy. I won't critique it beyond saying that I agree that Evans seems slight compared to ""our"" Morse, but that may be just a bit of selfish quibble as they make a real effort to inform the character and us of his resigned isolation and his love for the drama of classical music. Even if we can't yet see the middle-aged Morse we will come to know, one character in it does...at least that's the writers' charming and not so secret conceit....spoiler follows, but it's more an ""easter egg""....The reporter who shows up in several episodes to meet with Morse and discuss the latest case notices the younger man getting a bit frayed at the edges and gently raises her hand to him and advises him to take care. It is quite touching on its own, but ""more so"" as the reporter, played by John Thaw's daughter herself, Abigail, is reaching out to her own father. Knowing this, you might sense that HER persona seems more Morse-like than Evans, but in any case, it was as close an encounter of the third kind that ever was.",2016
7,"First three seasons got 9 out of 10 stars from the wife and me. We didn't watch for the Whodunit, but for the interplay between the characters, particularly Morse and Thursday. The restrained Englishness of the tough (in many surprising ways) father figure of Roger Allum's Thursday as he mentored the younger Morse was compelling and emotionally honest. That, along with the battles by Morse to remain ethically principled and true to himself as he sought to bring order to the world were great, great stuff.",2017
10,"With the decline of good TV shows, I will say that Endeavour continues to be the best show I've seen in quite some time. The characters, cast and plots are perfect. As of today, Endeavour is the only TV show that I spare time to watch.",2018
10,"We're not in Kansas anymore both literally and figuratively. Literally Longmire takes place in Wyoming. Figuratively it represents yet another persuasive piece of evidence for the view that higher quality product is coming out of TV than the studios these days. Whoda thunk it? Following JUSTIFIED and HATFIELDS/MCCOYS, we have this new entry and it is prime Grade A Entertainment. Arguably a little less showy than JUSTIFIED, it serves up each week a visceral portrait of an old-time lawman in the modern world -- Taylor is brilliant -- along with some intellectual thrills as well. In the first episode, Longmire justifies (pardon the pun) the fact that he was seen ""reading on the job"" by revealing the book he was reading -- and it's Sherlock Holmes. Recommended to keep your skills sharp, he explains. Also a nice blending of testosterone and estrogen, with Katee Sackhoff and Cassaday Freeman there to remind viewers that the Wild West was not merely a bunch of cranky old guys so macho they could jog home from their own vasectomies. Lou Diamond Phillips, a bit older now, is excellent in a supporting role. If all TV was this good, Hollywood would be out of a job..",2013
9,"I can understand some of the negative reviews. Some of it I agree with. On shows like this, if it is in your wheelhouse, you buy in completely, and I'm there. Some of the supporting characters are over the top, but one thing is for sure, Robert Taylor is amazing. I wish there was someway to get a buzz going on the Internet about a Best Actor nomination for an Emmy.",2012
7,I'll admit I only gave this show a chance because it premiered at a time when a lot of shows are on break. I'm glad that I did because this might just turn out to be the next great law show (Justified being the most recent). Have to wait and see how the season turns out.,2012
10,"Watched Longmire four times in the past 24 hours - stood up to my personal test! No wasted dialogue, all conversation is relevant to the story line, no unnecessary ""action,"" great scenery, interesting character development....",2012
8,"I really enjoyed the show. It reminded me of a Louis L'Amour novel. I haven't read the books this show is based on, but I plan to soon. I appreciated the pace, and overall feel of it. I felt completely absorbed in the realness of the characters, and really felt like I was in Wyoming. No glitzy computerized special effects, and no unrealistically fast crime scene analysis. I am looking forward to ""getting to know"" the characters. I loved the little town square, the Wranglers, and the scenery is breathtaking. I also enjoyed the music. Very happy the show includes one of my favorite actresses, Katee Sackhoff.",2012
10,"Crime, drama, good vs bad, characters and great actors all make for a good story line. There is enough subtle humor to keep it interesting, and the action is fast moving, so that it doesn't get boring. Conflict among the characters make it more real life. There is potential for the development of romance as the storyline unfolds. Some of the characters are recognizable from other major shows, which makes the show even more appealing. The characters display the true western tough-guy, no-nonsense approach to dealing with wild-west crime. The tough-girl on the show makes it even better. I look forward to seeing where the writers will take the various characters in future episodes.",2012
10,"I don't know what everyone else watched, but what I watched tonight was great! I loved the main character from the first scene. The other characters are strong and well portrayed. The scenery captures the wonderful open sky in Wyoming with beautiful shots. Plot development moves well and the characters you meet throughout are full and rich. They are real people,with the flaws and strengths that make for dense characterization. If you are looking for a character to pull for - tune in. There is humor and pathos. If you have ever experienced deep grief, then you will most likely 'get' Longmire. I hope you watch it. Great story.",2012
9,"I had not planned to watch this series, but luckily caught the Pilot. The characters are multi faceted, deep and interesting. The scenery is beautiful. It is wonderful to watch a program that doesn't depend on special effects and empty chatter. Granted there have been a couple of scenes I would have left on the editing floor, but overall, great. I love the Wyoming and Indian Reservation setting. Be careful, you might actually learn something. Robert Taylor is well cast as the sheriff. Personally, I would have loved John Corbett as the Sheriff. I love ""Ruby"". Is she an actress or a real sheriff office employee? The actors are that good. Louie Diamond Phillips is always excellent. I'm looking forward to the new season.",2013
10,"Normally, I will ignore most new shows for a complete season. No real reason other than most should be canceled before the pilot gets filmed. I did the same for, ""Longmire"", until I heard from people I work with say this show was worth a look. I sat down and turned on Netflix and watched the pilot. Needless to say, I was impressed. To ensure that the pilot was not some weird fluke I watched a couple more episode – again – I was impressed - well - more like hooked. Most summer programs are garbage and should be left to fester, but ""Longmire"" is well worth the time to turn on the TV and munch on a snack or two. Oddly, I do agree this is probably 'some tired', 'rehashed', 'hackneyed' rip-off of 'some crime story', and doesn't have anything really 'new' or 'fresh.' Well more often than not 'new' and/or 'fresh' usually means the main character has some 'super-duper-mystical-mysterious-phenomenal talent' – so what actually is 'new' or 'fresh' about that kind of garbage? I just want a show with good stories, good scripts and good acting – you can save fancy-pants CGI for 'Cops Of Steal.' For me, this show is gritty, fast paced and enjoyable (better than many of the over-budgeted movies I have had to suffer through.) No sanctimonious hidden meaning, just a sheriff who has no cape or 'cerebral insight', he just has a 1911 .45cal; an old Ford Bronco he can't keep on the road, a painfully honest bartender/friend and some snarky deputies. All of whom are well cast. This show is beyond the great potential stage and is well on its way to be my favorite (so long 'Mentalist', 'Bones' and - yes - even 'NCIS')",2013
8,"Longmire is an interesting character driven show. With some unique situations and breathtaking scenery, this series deserves a long run. Let's give this show time to develop. The relationships between Longmires daughter and the deputy sets the stage for a possible rocky three way feud. Lou Diamond Phillips, as the bar owner part time tracker, does some of the best acting that he has done in years. The supporting cast is believable and the guest roles have been filled with creditable and sometimes quirky characters that give a different sense of style to each episode. AMC has served up several excellent series and this may just be one of the best yet.",2012
10,"So I watched the pilot and fell in love with the show for many different reasons; the beautiful countryside, the cleverly written mysteries, the sly Indian friend, the spunky deputy..... But above all, I fell in love with Walt Longmire played brilliantly by Robert Taylor. (Who I was slightly crushed to find out was Australian, not American.) ",2013
9,"Don't be put off by your first impressions... judging by the poster, title and description, I was expecting this to be dreary and dull. It wasn't! If you like 'Justified' then you will really like this.",2013
10,"i watch a lot of old westerns and western TV reruns. Longmire reminds me of the Marshal Dillion TV show. Excellent! My favorite episode so far, The Dog Soldier. Am sitting here with Marshall Dillon on at present. He tall, a gentleman and will kick your ass when necessary. They are one and the same. Hope it doesn't go the way of the good TV shows and TV has the intelligence to order more seasons. There's already too much that isn't watchable these days. As a N. American i like the fact that the series shows the difficulities N. American STILL face. With all the stupid reality TV shows this one with is simply reality stands out. And thats a good thing. As my mothers people would say Nuwedi! (Thank you)",2012
10,I am so excited to get the date for season 5 that I have already put it on my calendar! There are only about 4 decent shows on TV and Longmire on Netflix is right up at the top of the list. THANK YOU Netflix for bringing the show back. I will not miss an episode!,2015
10,"The Longmire TV show is based upon a series of books written by Craig Johnson (his latest just released being ""As the Crow Flies"". The books contain a lot more rich background and details about the various characters than is possible to depict in the TV show. The TV show is filmed in New Mexico but if you notice in some scenes they have changed the license plates to Wyoming where the books are based. All in all I have really enjoyed watching the TV shows especially after having read all of the Longmire books. The writers and producers of the show have changed some of the characters. Deputy Ferg in the books is a ""semi-retired"" older deputy who always seems to be out fly fishing. The upcoming election for sheriff pits Longmire against a person who is not working within the sheriff's department. Vic is pretty true to the book story line however she uses a lot more colorful language in the books. Henry Standing Bear has a pony tail is tall and well built and is a hit with all of the women. Well enjoy the series and pick up some of the books to read they are a hoot.",2012
9,"Love this show because of its balance. Acting, writing, production values are all top quality. No whiny shrieking reality show/cheapie comedy crap. Real stories beautifully presented. Looking forward to a greater Indian presence in the scripts.I went out and read all the books because the show hooked me so drastically. Glad to say that the bones are in the books but the show is taking its own direction. I do wonder sometimes how, since this is such a small town, how it can have quite so many murders but so far there are ""reasonable"" explanations for the deaths. There do seem to be a great many really expensive looking homes and very little seems to be happening ""in town."" Hopefully season 2 will expand the horizon a bit.",2012
7,"First, I must say this TV series is amazing and I trust it will have a multi-season run and wind up in syndication.",2012
10,"I watched this show from the beginning, and so far it was great (seasons 1-3). But not because there was more action than anywhere else or more mystery or something like that. No it was different, Longmire is a character driven story, that relies on the interpersonal connections and conflicts, while offering an at least decent story which was always framed by a bigger one (The murder of Sheriff Longmires wife and so on). Added to that the scenery is simply stunningly beautiful. It makes you feel like you are in the wide open with nothing but nature around you. AMAZING! Now I want to get to the 4th season.",2015
10,"It was difficult for me to pull this out of Netflixs to watch: First, I'm not a cowboy type of guy. Secondly, something about the middle of Wyoming doesn't sound too interesting. Well I was completely wrong! I only watched this because I was a big fan of BSG (Battle Star Galatica) and Katie. Anyway, the writing, lead acting, and many story arcs have you on your seat waiting for you next scene!",2014
9,"I don't know if anyone has mentioned it or not but the music is very cool in this series. Nice selection. And then there is Lou Diamond Phillips who brings an air of authenticity . I like living in the open new west without living in the new west and with a soundtrack. Just to cool! It is a tad of a stretch that the murder rate per capita is far fetched but maybe it's those wide open spaces and too much time on their hands huh? It's a show and if it were too believable it would not hit the mark for me. The acting is tight, the scenery of Northern New Mexico is beautiful and it is something totally different in terms of western fare. I find it relaxing.",2014
7,"I liked the plots of the shows, the acting, as well as the characters.",2013
10,"The Season 2 finale, ""Bad Medicine,"" was a nail-biter. Well written, well acted especially by Taylor who has found his signature role. The fans of this show are awaiting news of the renewal of this innovative crime drama. Most of the minor roles are well-acted as well. The relationship between Henry and Walt is an unusual one for television--a much better 21st rendition of a the ""Lone Ranger and Tonto"" characterizations than the film released this summer with Johnny Depp, playing Tonto. The production values on Longmire are as good as most feature films. The stories are compelling and the characters are memorable. AMC needs to renew ASAP!",2013
10,"Love this show! I just finished the 1st season & ready to get caught up on season 2. I put this show right up there with the best (i.e. NCIS & Bones). Great characters/casting, good story-lines, beautiful scenery, and some really good soundtrack music! How can you NOT love a show that has the first episode opening up with Steve Earle's ""Transcendental Blues""? Robert Taylor totally looks & sounds the part of a western wilderness sheriff. Katie Sackhoff in her best role since Starbuck! And Lou Diamond Phillips...stellar! Great supporting cast too...I love Zahn McClarnon as Mathias. The 'story behind the story' is also intriguing. I hope this show goes on for a long time!",2013
10,"This is one of the best series I've had the pleasure to watch in a long time. Great interplay between the main characters and set in the great outdoors. I've only seen three episodes but all very, very good indeed. By the way,If you're a fan of the C.J Box Joe Pickett books you'll love this series. Robert Taylor's depiction of a taciturn almost grumpy sheriff is top notch and so is Lou Diamond Phillips' character plus a great supporting cast. I have not read the books but they must be an excellent read if they can come up with this. Brings back memories of the great long running western series of years back.PLEASE KEEP THIS SERIES GOING!!! Just great!",2013
10,"If you want history at its truth, watch a documentary. As entertainment this show has it all. Every episode has had me in tears from either laughter or poignancy. The casting is perfect and beautifully shot. It really shows the diverse community that has embedded itself in our culture today. Who cares if the docks were not in the right place! The show is about people coming together in tough times and bonding with a community regardless of class and colour. It makes me yearn for that kind of spirit in todays world where everyone has so much and yet is never satisfied. I really hope the BBC invest in a new series - I already miss Miranda!",2012
10,"I have to say I am a bit of a BBC miniseries junkie. So, I am always looking for a new world to jump into. I have to say that ""Call the Midwife"" is one of the best series I have seen. I am enchanted by the young girls and their commitment to caring for their community. And what makes it even more perfect is that they work alongside nuns and can see the world through their eyes. I watch this show over and over again hoping to be dazzled once again (and I always am). I don't know how accurate it is (I have not studied the time), but I do think it is a fantastic commentary on poverty, the role of women, and social class differences. If this were only a drama I wouldn't watch it again and again. But the humor (CHUMMY!!) and the light hearted moments among the business of birth is perfect! Truly, I would love to drop myself into that time and live simply where my only goal was to help women and love people well. You will thoroughly enjoy this show it sisterhood, faith, love, and courage interest you.",2013
10,"As I was a student nurse in the East End of London during the mid fifties,(now an ex-pat living in Mexico) this series brings back many memories. I'm glad that some episodes include general nursing and even male patients as well as midwifery. Perhaps doctors were not always as good as the nurses in those days.I even remember an anaesthetist who sat doing his crossword puzzles during operations and no one dared utter a word of reproach.",2014
9,"Whether or not this series' depiction of the East End in the 50's is completely accurate or not seems of little relevance to me. The characters are very likable and the acting, even by the guest actors, is brilliant. However, the main reason I love and wholeheartedly recommend Call the Midwife is because it is so well written, without avoiding the harsh realities of life yet filled with hope and incredible human connection. Miraculously, it manages this without ever becoming cheesy. Every episode leaves me feeling proud to be a human being. I don't think many TV series are able or even try to achieve this and it feels especially important in our times when faith in humanity seems to be in decline.",2014
8,"I would have scored 10 for this series, except for the fact that it doesn't truly follow the accounts written in the book from which it is taken.",2012
10,"After the introduction to the series last year, I didn't think it could be topped, but with it's sometimes gritty, always touching stories Call the Midwife, Season Two has proved the series has staying power. It's easy to see why Call the Midwife is so popular in the States and abroad. Stories of sisterly bonds among friends and the miracle of childbirth never get old.",2013
7,"Season 5 of Call the Midwife is a cracker. After a massive slump for a few years, the quality of the plots and writing has really improved this year. The series' chief fault continues to be how treacly some of the dialogue is. The voice-over at the start and at the end is still very cheesy. They don't have to scrap it, just make it less sugary. And some of the nurses and nuns spout moralistic phrases that sound like they come straight from the pages of an Enid Blyton children's novel. That said, I've been impressed by the ensemble acting, the beautifully detailed sets, locations and costumes, and most of all, the story lines. Some meaty topics have been covered this season, from typhoid to thalidomide, sexual assault, contraception, lesbian relationships, mothers who covered up for their teenage pregnant daughters, and single mothers whose married lovers abandoned them. It's all great stuff, much of it still relevant in the modern era. Helen George, as nurse Trixie Franklin, has been outstanding this season; she's really outshone Charlotte Ritchie, as Nurse Barbara. Cynthia (Bryony Hannah) has gone on a very interesting journey from midwife to nun, and continues to be very likable. I love how the older nurses and nuns also get generous screen time. Dr Patrick Turner (Stephen McGann) must be the most thoroughly good doctor character on TV and the actor always looks like he's having a good time. Dr Turner does have one fault - it's alarming to watch him puff away on the cigarettes in the consulting room, and no one bats and eyelid! His wife, Scottish nun turned nurse Shelagh Turner (Laura Main), is just too good to be true! She is adorable, but surely she must have some faults! Similarly, chief nun Sister Julienne (Jenny Agutter) is more or less a saint; saying nothing but words of wisdom. But it is refreshing that someone with that much integrity is a central character in a series. Bless her heart. One of my favourites continues to be the naughty, very old, and possibly demented Sister Monica Joan (Judy Parfitt) who has enormous fun, just hanging around the convent, doing and saying exactly what she pleases.",2012
8,The first two reviewers say the way the BBC portrayed the East End of London is incorrect.,2012
9,"This is a wonderful television series for women of all ages! Somehow the subject of child-birth, and everything around it, never stops fascinating. Whether you are a young woman with it all in front of you, or past child-bearing age - it is forever interesting! :-) This series really have it all: humour and high drama, sorrow and happiness, love of all kinds, interesting characters, and a touch of religion. It is also educating: you learn a lot about midwifery, medicine, and modern history.",2013
9,"I recently found this series on Netflix and instantly fell in love with it. I have never read the books, so I have nothing else to go by. The characters are fabulous. The actors/actresses are amazing. I think every episode has made me both laugh and cry, and I'm looking forward to more! ",2013
9,"I do agree with those reviewers who have pointed out that this is not a documentary but a drama. Yes indeed some details are wrong ( I grew up in the UK in this era so have some knowledge of it, tho not quite so grindingly poor) True, that the nuns are not, to me, very believable, appearing, apart from the lovely chanted prayers, to have no spiritual life or discipline at all . Still they are good TV , though not as utterly great TV as Miranda Hart as Chummy. I think it unlikely that Lady Fortescue Cholmondley -Brown would have capitulated as easily as she did, but who cares .It was worth it if only for Chummy's line ""Sorry Mater, not entitled any more"" when exhorted to wear white for her wedding...",2012
10,"**UPDATE AFTER SEASON 6: If I could mark 11 stars, that would be it. The episodes about the Thalidomide children were hard but very well focused and treated. I am intrigued at how they film the scenes with just born babies in the very hands of the actors, with wide shots, not just close-ups. Call the Midwife is a most humanistic show indeed, focused on believable, realistic positive values. In a time when humanism seems to be disgraced and devalued everywhere, it is most welcome in my screen.***",2016
7,"I was a schoolchild in London in 1957, so I watched this programme expecting to see the London I remember recreated. I had to go to school on the tube and underground. I was from north London, but quite a few of my school friends came from East London. When I went to tea with them after school, their homes were clean and perfectly respectable. One thing I do remember though, was the warehouses and the docks were strictly out of bounds, although we could, and did, play on the bomb sites. I still have friends who were brought up in East London in the 1950s. I think this series is based on the exceptional cases rather than the normal ones. Certainly there were homes in the area, which had survived the bombing and had outside toilets and tin baths. In my experience, my friends' Mums kept their flats immaculately clean inside. The, houses, warehouses and the dock walls were all blackened with soot from the railways. 1957 was before the clean air act and fogs and smogs were common. It was good to see people getting about by bicycle, cars were few in the 1950s and mostly black saloons. I don't remember meeting or seeing any exceptionally large families. All the friends and family I had and now have, who were born and brought up in east London, are either only children, or have one or two siblings. I will watch the rest of the series with interest.",2012
9,"It's hard to believe that anyone could be as compassionate and tender as the midwives in Call the Midwife, compassion and tenderness being rare qualities in the increasingly disconnected world of the 21st century. I suspect those qualities are a real incentive for even the casual viewer of this series, which depicts the lives of midwives toiling in the east London of the late 50s- early 1960s. The world of almost 60 years ago was a very different one from today, both from a social and technological standpoint. I'm impressed by the attention to detail in the series, which allows viewers to immerse themselves in the stories, which touch upon issues such as abortion and incest, as well as the then real threats of polio and tuberculosis. More recent stories have even addressed the thalidomide tragedy. The acting is, without exception, top notch, especially that of Judy Parfitt as Sister Monica Joan. I tend to be especially critical of shows that rely on lachrymose sentimentality to further the story. Call the Midwife is at times tender, sweet tempered and, well, nice, but never false as it displays the panorama of the human condition.",2016
10,"My wife and I have been regular viewers of PBS' various British dramas for more than 40 years. I believe that ""Call the Midwife"" stands with anything that PBS has shown in that time. The cast is outstanding, and is aided by terrific writing. The producers and writers have done a very good job of pulling stories from the books, and presenting an element of 20th Century London history that most American viewers knew nothing about. There is a wonderful blend of humor, sadness, and an overall sense of time and place that is rarely achieved in TV dramas. I have particularly liked the sensitive portrayal of the sisters throughout the series, since (believe it or not) my mother had studied to become a nun. They are consistently shown as a complete person, not characterized as stiff and robotic people. If you haven't read the books the series is based upon, try them. You will see how faithfully the producers have followed them. A wonderful series!",2014
10,"Call the Midwife. 10/10. Yes, I like this series very much. These are some of my observations. I am in the U.S., and we always see the British TV series later, ala Downton Abbey, which I also watch. I DVR both Midwife and Downton.",2014
10,"Call the Midwife is one of the best BBC programs I have watched and I have seen many. The acting is superb,the stories are well written. There is always something going on which affects almost every member of the cast in each episode. It is a story that goes in many directions but then comes together at the end.",2015
8,Despite the deviations from the original book by Jennifer worth I truly enjoy watching this programme. As a midwife myself I find it really difficult to watch any TV show that portrays pregnancy and child birth due to the often inaccurate and unlikely events that unfold. Call the midwife is the only programme I can watch that portrays childbirth without shouting and screaming at the TV wishing the researchers had put more effort in.,2016
9,"Obviously I am a man, and will say without any hesitation that we are hooked on this series! My wife and I are best friends and there is nothing more we enjoy than finding a good British series to immerse ourselves together. We have done this for many years, initially finding them in our travels to Britain, and find that British shows seem to ""out weigh"" our American television on many levels.",2017
10,"This program is slow paced, old fashioned, not too exciting or glamorous, with little sex or violence. All that aside, it may well be the best drama series on TV today.",2014
6,"I used to love this show and still like a few characters, but it's becoming so politically correct, I'm starting to hate it. A snow lady, really? And I'm sure that back in the '60's racists were considered ignorant and rude, as this show suggests.
You've talked enough about discrimination, you've had a lesbian couple, enough with your progressive agenda already. ",2018
9,"This is one of the best shows on tv. I discovered it two years ago while watching a Masterpiece presentation. Haven't missed an episode since. I prefer shows like The Americans, The Walking Dead, Fargo, etc. but this one struck a chord somewhere in the depths of my psyche and I instantly liked the stories, the scenery of 1960's London and all of the characters. This is television at its best.",2017

10,"A few months ago, I saw a teaser on ABC advertising this new show ""Nashville."" At the time, I was skeptical of the show, dismissing it as just another one season wonder. I assumed it would employ pointless sexuality, unrealistic dialogue (done in cheesy southern accents), and plot points that ventured outside of likelihood.",2012

10,This show makes you FEEL.,2012
10,"This is a great TV show with great actors and great music!!! By far one of the best new shows of the season!!!!! The story lines have tonnes of potential and the music gets better and better!!!! Its different than a lot of the TV out there, it's not the same old, same old. People watch this show and stop with all the reality crap!!! I am tired of good television shows getting cancelled before they are ever given a chance. You don't have to be a country music fan to watch this show, I'm not and I've already downloaded some of the songs they were that good. You just have to like good TV with good stories and appreciate good music. And this is good TV",2012
9,Now lets just start off by saying I had already expected to like this show. I'm a big fan of the 2 female leads and reading and hearing all the buzz and what i'd seen in previews I had a feeling we were in for something special.,2012
10,"I can't say enough about this drama. Connie Britton also produces plays Rayna James, a veteran country music star. She does a fabulous job in the role and should be getting an Emmy for it. Hayden Panetterie whom I watched when she was on Guiding Light years ago is fantastic as Juliet Barnes, a rising star. She does a fantastic job in her role. Powers Boothe plays Rayna's father and is brilliant in his supporting role. Eric Close is fine as Teddy Conrad, Rayna's husband. The best part of the show is that it is filmed on location in Nashville, Tennessee and it shows with landmark sites like the Ryman Auditorium, the Grand Ole Opry, the Bluebird Cafe, and others. The series shows light on the country music set, politics, and the relationships and dynamics among them. Can't wait for the next episode! This show is a winner!",2012
9,"I'm not particularly a fan of country music so I watched this first out of simple curiosity. Now I'm hooked. Why? The MUSIC in this show is terrific. I have actually bought two of the songs from i Tunes. And, like I said, I'm not a fan of country music. The plot is FUN. It's interesting. Some reviewer said that it was an obvious plot, but my god, this is TV and if the plot is obvious then so is the on button on your remote. The plot is FUN and it moves -- fast. When some character acts like a jerk his retribution is swift. When two young people look lovingly at each other in the next scene they are bonded. If the rich guy has a reputation for buying his way into politics in the next scene he DOES IT. It's TV and it's fun. The music in the show is amazing to me. I'm a classical music kind of guy but I melted over the performances of ""Fade Into You"" and ""If I didn't know better"". Also, the talent who sings these songs is new to me and they have intriguing voices. Surprisingly, one is an Australian and the other is English but they know how to do lovely singing.",2012
7,"I should begin by saying that I'm not usually a fan of dramas. If a show doesn't make me laugh, then most likely, I won't keep up with it. I am, however, a big country music lover so I decided to give this show a shot. I ended up watching three episodes in a row and had to stop myself or else I would just forget about my real life obligations.",2013
9,"I have seen the first two episodes and in each I was mesmerized by the music. While I deeply enjoy all kinds of music from classical to heavy metal, truth be known that I have never really followed country. That is until this show grabbed hold of me from its inception. At first I thought that the music was dubbed, but it is not and what amazes me is the singing talents of Connie and Hayden. The duet sung by Clare and Sam was mind blowing. Not just the singing but the camera work and the looks on the faces of the actors was as much apart of the song as the voices. If you didn't feel anything from viewing and listening to it you must be on the slab at the coroners.",2012
9,I love the show and characters but Scarlett's character is looking tired sick and the hair is awful... I'm falling not so in love with her any more. It's dragging on and she is scorn and broken and losing interest... please don't make her irrelevant. Smile once in awhile! Shine some light in her and less sadness.,2017
7,"I loved this show initially. Sadly, I can now hardly get through an episode. I really want to like it, so I'm hoping that it gets back to what it once was. My main objections are:",2012
7,"As many have pointed out, the show is a soap opera, though an unusually deft one. Largely due to excellent writing, the characters are convincingly complex and fallible, and the actors--particularly those playing musicians--do a good job of displaying the necessary onstage charisma while dealing with offstage tendencies and problems that are much less glamorous. What these actors don't do very well is sing. Both Connie Britton and Hayden Panettiere have sweet but small voices with no dynamics, and, though I can believe that teen and tween fans have put Panettiere's Juliette on the charts, I cannot believe that Britton's Rayna has stayed on top for a generation, especially as an interpreter of other people's songs. But, as the production of the show's songs is very slick, most viewers will like them, unaware that modern technology can make anyone sound okay. I just wish Callie Khouri had opted to hire a great country singer for Rayna's performances; then I wouldn't have such a hard time appreciating the difference between her ""storied career"" and Juliette's ""flash in the pan."" As it is, they sound more alike than different; Rayna is merely older",2013
10,"The IMDb Page is a total mess, There is no listing to when the next episode is except for the date of the last episode. it lists the shows end when we don't know when its going to get the axed again. And as for the cat Facebook live show, I am highly disappointed First i don't like being called a nasheys, I am a fan of nashville but that term is so ""I'm a stupid 30 something root showing blonde vally girl republican host with an IQ of a mud stick. I don't like it and the ships this bitch comes up with are ridiculous 110%. Also the hashtags suck okay i have a better one #NashvilleIsFamily it fly's off the tongue much, much better. The bitches questions suck? there not informative and its an insult to an actor to ask or talk to them as there characters they play, they are not the writers of the show they don't know whats gonna happen, And its also an insult as a true fan to type cast them these people work hard and that dits needs fired and so does the bitch that only knows the cords on the guitar..

Deacon's niece Scarlett O'Connor (Clare Bowen), Avery Barkley (Jonathan Jackson), and Gunnar Scott (Sam Palladio) are aspiring musicians with love connections.

1,"The character is awful. It is constant drama and craziness. Enough already. Her speaking voice is irritating to include her singing voice. She is so whiny and talks like a baby constantly. The other characters at least have depth to them. And Gunnar is such an amazing guy he doesn't deserve that crazy cliché' of a woman. Bring back Teddy Layla, or Luke Wheeler. The sad thing is I recently met her in person and she is the same whiny, horrible person in real life. She had an amazing friendly man sitting next to her that would order for her because she couldn't be bothered to speak to the help. It didn't surprise me from how bad the character is.",2017
3,"Season 1, 2, and most of 3 were awesome! I was fully addicted to this show! I couldn't get enough! Then hit Season 4. Since when does a 16 year old run the house and get away with being a rude, disrespectful, ungrateful snot?? And every time she does wrong, it's the parents fault? The show is overly dramatic with 15 things going wrong in one episode, usually with a single person. SPOILER: Every artist Rayna signs to her label has some issue where they leave the label as quickly as they signed. The first three seasons had their drama and frustrations, but not like this. I am so disappointed. I just feel like the show is more frustrating than enjoyable now. I am having a hard time finishing the 4th season. If I am being honest, I can see why the show was canceled initially after Season 4. Seriously hoping Season 5 gets back to the roots of what the show was prior.",2016

3,This show is becoming somewhat of a joke. ,2014
1,"Wow season 3 of Scandal was so bad it absolutely wiped out what Scandal had established in Season 1 and 2. For a political drama this show has now turned into a fantasy satire. Every character on the show is a villain. The president, the vice president and all of Olivia's love interests, as well as her entire family are mass murderers involved in some recycled Alias storyline that has been done to death. Olivia is no longer the strong, independent woman from season 1 and most of season 2, she is now a incompetent, weak cry baby who follows the president like a puppy no matter what he does or who he kills. There is no one to root for anymore as this is a show about terrible people doing ridiculous things. The acting is over the top as everyone in the cast seems to scream one line after the other and the dialogue is so unbelievable and clichéd. The show is now filled with cheap thrills and gimmicks(Hannibal would be proud of Mama Pope), taking itself so seriously yet offering nothing in return.",2014
1,"This show seems like it was written by or for children or overly- emotional halfwits. The writing has all the depth and nuance of a ridiculous dime store romance novel. Nothing that happens in this show is based in reality, no character is either real or likable, and none of their reactions are in any way realistic. Every single character seems like they have the emotional age of an impetuous tween. ",2017
1,"I enjoyed first 2 seasons, but has sunk faster than the Titanic. Over time you realize everyone acts the same. Every actor has the same cadence when they talk. Olivia can't act, it's just the same expression over and over and over and over... By this last season , you realize it's the most idiotic thing you've ever watched EVER. It's hilariously stupid, yet the show still takes itself seriously... It's like Adam Sandler thinking 1 of his movies will win an Oscar. I'm not surprised by any twist and turn because it's so stupid - it's just 1 eye roll after another. I feel like the type of show it was changed after the first 2 years. Anyways, I want my life back",2017
2,"What appears as an intriguing storyline quickly reveals itself as a poorly executed concept. The acting is weak at best with the lead having only two facial expressions, the plastic surgery stiff face and then the weepy eyed look. The plot is hinged on the impossible and the relationship between the president and the main character is replayed in a pathetic unbelievable constant replay cycle.",2013
4,"CAN'T TAKE THIS SHOW ANYMORE!!!! ""Scandal"" is becoming one hell of a soap opera. Every actor is OVERACTING, it's like every one is PMSing... ""Olivia Pope"" just makes sad, confused faces and shouts all the time, it's annoying. ""Huck"" only WHISPERS, since episode one... ""Jake Ballard"" wants to be the bad ass, but sorry, far from it, he only makes puppy faces with puppy eyes.... this show just died... last episode was like: ""let's get everyone having sex, to put some sparkles on it"".... FAILED!!!!!! Horrible timing... maybe the producers, could perhaps take some notes from ""House of Cards"" and ""Political Animals""... and I understand this is supposed to be a ""scandal"" from a romance btw the president and an outsider, but both of them are becoming narcissistic pricks and I don't even care if they stay together, the show would be better if they actually found others to get involved with. Everything in Scandal just SUCKS lately!!!! Good bye ""soap opera""... I'm done!!!!",2014
2,"This show is not very good. I have watched every episode hoping that it would find its legs, but sadly, it has not. The show is poorly written, the characters are very 2 dimensional. If you have watched T V in the last 10 years, you will easily guess what the characters will say and do. The shows repeated usages of characters saying ""Olivia Pope"" is irritating. The stories are so black and white no shades of gray. The stories each week do not fit into any current or past realities. The acting or directing is so poor I cannot figure it out. There is not real chemistry between the characters. The naïve character (Quinn Perkins) is so naïve you wonder why anyone would hire her. The tech guru/former black ops killer (Huck), does not that just sound silly. The slick, fasting talker (Harrison Wright), surprise, surprise is played by a black guy. Then there is the powerful smart women (Abby Whelan) who got beaten by her husband. The characters sound more like the cast of Leverage. The concept of the story is great but the execution is extremely poor. The show just does not have real passion behind it, then again how can you have passion or insight about this larger than life powerful black women who is having an affair with the President of the United States.",2012
1,"Way too much dialogue. How many different ways can one line of script be delivered? It comes-off as a vehicle for the writers trying too hard to prove their wit and intelligence. How many words are necessary to make one point? Move along; nothing more to hear, here; less is more. This would be a half-hour show if the script redundancy were eliminated.",2016

6,"Review is based on recently watched DVDs of Seasons 1-2. I loved the first season of the show: A great premise, a great cast, great acting and it was well written. ABC's full-season orders are destroying the quality of the show. The stories are becoming even more outlandish while also having clichéd and predictable conclusions.",2014
3,"Used to be one of my favorite shows. It started out great, but went off course starting last season. I just watched the first episode of the new season, and it will be the last I watch. Totally ridiculous. Very disappointed. Watching Olivia try to be so tough, and Nellie going along with it, is just too ""out there"" and not believable. So sad. What was Rhimes thinking!",2017
1,"I mean come on, 7.8 out of 10 for this? I agree with most of the negative reviews. Poor execution in a scenario that is forced to be twisted too much. It is irritating how the characters sometimes babble something for too long. I guess it was meant to be a heartfelt speech or something. I blame the writers for that. And the main character, Olivia Pope, either makes a sad face expression or yells for no good reason. She comes across as a self-righteous person who, contrary to how the other characters describe her in the series, always makes the wrong call and does not know how to do her job. At the end, somehow the job gets done anyway, no thanks to her.",2017
1,"This show had just gotten so ridiculous and far-fetched, it's difficult to watch. The acting of Jeff Perry (Cyrus) is laughable at every turn. Kerry Washington is so one-dimensional and the way she enunciates every word is downright annoying. Tony Goldwyn totally sucks as POTUS. I will continue to watch and since I don't watch Sitcoms, I'll laugh at this pathetic excuse for a show. I will finish it and hope that Shonda Rhimes goes on a sabbatical!!!",2017
2,"This show was way better in the first two or so seasons. Back then, a lot of the episodes focused on the main characters using their skills to mop up different political scandals around town. There was a larger story arc that was okay too, but it was never all that interesting.",2017
1,"I've just watched (to my shame) the first 3 episodes. Just can't do anymore. It's all way too terrible. What's wrong with you people who are giving this tripe such high scores! Have you not watched anything decent?? Like the West Wing, Damages, Boardwalk Empire, House of Cards, Rectify, The Knick, heaps of others. Clearly not - because if you had you would have had something decent to compare it to and therefore would have been bored shitless with this utter garbage by episode 3 just like me. I'm struggling to find more printable words to make the 10 line minimum review on this god-awful mess of a series full of the most ridiculous story lines being played out by smug, self-satisfied extremely dislikable characters who are just plain irritating. Please don't bother with this crap.",2016
10,"I had stopped watching prime time shows because of the lack of quality and diversity in casting. But WOW, Scandal has me hooked! This show is just incredible, brilliantly written, directed, and acting-- I have been on the edge of my seat from the opening scene until the credits. I hope that this show gains fans and ratings. I know I'm telling all of my friends to watch! The casting is rock solid. Casting Kerry Washington as Olivia Pope is inspired. Tony Goldwin as the POTUS is incredibly powerful. The chemistry between the two of them is amazingly hot. I'm eager to learn more of their back story as well as that of the other characters.",2012
1,"I'm not quite sure why this series annoyed me as much as it did. Well, I think the music is really horrible, the separating cut scenes are irritating, the main character is such a stereotype, the rest of the cast is equally unimaginative, the dialog is lackluster, the acting is wooden, the plot is trying too hard and the set design is just so contrived. You know, that doesn't make for top notch TV entertainment in my book but at the same time it really doesn't explain why I found this so painful to watch. I guess it's because there is so much high quality stuff out there and you can immediately see what series the creators of Scandal draw inspiration from. Which series they try to rip off. As there is no original idea here and everything is so predictable that you inevitably wait for this to be done with, I will give this a very with berth from now on. But don't let that put you off.",2014
1,"Just watches Scandal seasons 1-3 back to back (unfortunately my Homeland cds were out of reach!) and wow! How I do NOT like any of their protagonists, least of all Olivia Pope!! How did they manage that, I wonder?? You always find yourself rooting for the bad guys! Cannot stand this soap opera. And why does it keep being picked up? Thought that since there was 4-5 season of it must be good...what is America watching??? Really??? Pope is so self-righteous and a wimp, don't know why everyone utters her name like she is something special...they need some new writers maybe? Or a completely new show! This show - at some point- starts to look and sound like its on a loop....borrrrrrriiiiiiinnnnnnggggg....",2015
1,"I know the genre of this show is Drama but everyone in it has decided to take the acting beyond its literal meaning, especially that lead character - Olivia Pope. One minute she's overly angry, next minute she's crying or making weird faces. Funny she didn't even cry when her friend James died. Cyrus, on the other hand, gave a compelling performance in that episode. Wow. I actually came close to shedding a tear. ",2014
1,"I started watching the show and was hooked initially, until the season 3 came along. The show has gotten extremely boring and monotonous. Olivia Pope's (Kerry Washington) acting is over the top and looks so annoying when she gets aggressive and starts to overly enunciate words with her loud mouth (SERIOUSLY WHY OVERACT?). ",2016
1,"This show seems like it was written by or written for delusional women who would otherwise be reading ridiculous romance novels. Nothing that happens in this show is based in reality and no one on the show is emotionally older than 15. Furthermore, none of the characters have a personality. It sounds like the same person wrote every ridiculous silly tantrum that the show tries to make into an impassioned speech ... every 7 minutes or so.",2014
1,My wife and I have persevered with this show because by halfway through S2 we decided it was absolutely the most overacted and unconvincing characters ever in a soap. From then on we watched for the amusement factor (in between Game of Thrones and True Detectives... decent dramas) and to sit and make fun of it. Kerry Washington has to be just about the most overrated and worst actress on the planet with her stupid faces she pulls and her ridiculous walk with a massive empty handbag. Huck is about as bad as a baby pug and the rest of them may as well just give up acting. Olivia's father in the show once he opened his gob you just wanted to put your boot in it as you know he wasn't going to shut up for about 10 minutes while the camera flashes to Olvia Pope like she was struggling on the toilet. Please if you are considering watching this utter tripe don't waste 60 hours of your life that you will never get back. Please don't commission a Season 6..please spare us the embarrassment.,2015
4,"Scandal started out as a great show. Olivia Pope was a strong female lead commanding everyone around her and then she disappeared and a weak, indecisive, approval seeking wimp moved in. The stories became more and more outlandish and the soap opera sex became front and center. Kerry Washington can only pout her lips so much before it gets old. The long-winded, breath holding monologues are now done by everyone on the show, taking more of Olivia's fire away from her. Every character is now delivering lines with the exact same tempo as Kerry Washington, further diluting what made Olivia Pope a compelling character. It's really quite sad. Olivia Pope used to control everything and everyone. She used to fix every mess. Now she just is a mess. The other characters are a mess. The show is a mess. That's the real scandal.",2014

But, here and now in this extraordinary Steven Spielberg/Tony Kushner version, the illusion is complete. I was watching the president and not for a moment thought of the actor. That in itself is close to unique. I left the theater with the feeling I've just had an out of body experience. Everything around the central performance - and I call it a performance because I don't know what else to call it - falls into place in a miraculous way. The photography, the production design, the wardrobe made it possible to actually smell the period. Congratulations and thank you.",2012
9,"Daniel Day-Lewis is something of an unsung miracle; the man will come out of nowhere, select an unlikely role, knock it out of the park, then quietly crawl back into the ground for the next three or four years before repeating the same process. He is an underrated talent most likely due to his lack of a prolific career, somewhat like director Terrence Malick. Here, Day-Lewis teams up with one of Hollywood's most prolific men, Steven Spielberg, who is coming off a stellar 2011, where he produced both Super 8 and Transformers: Dark of the Moon and directed both The Adventures of Tintin and War Horse, two acclaimed pictures.",2012
10,"I'm prepared to admit at this point that Daniel Day Lewis has succeeded to the title of most brilliant actor of his generation--and I do not say that lightly.

Now reunite Spielberg with long standing producing partner Kathleen Kennedy, throw in a multi-award winning star cast lead by Daniel Day-Lewis and a story about one of the most revered Presidents in US history and you have an Academy Award nominated movie by default. Lincoln has all these fine qualities and a whole lot more. This is not just a great film for the reasons stated above, or because it is very easy to praise a film directed by Spielberg. This is also not just a masterpiece or a very important and powerful film for the sake of calling it so. From the drawing boards to its last take, Lincoln is every bit exquisitely fashioned filmmaking — an amalgamation of art, literature, politics, society, history, and most importantly, humanism.",2014

As I walked out, I absolutely knew that I would be back. There are so many amazing actors in this movie that I need to go back to fully appreciate the story.",2012
4,"Steven Spielberg visuals are excellent in movies and this one is no exception. He does a wonderful job recreating the time period that Lincoln was a part of. The difficulty I have is in believing some of the dialogue and the revisionist history that takes place in this movie. The opening scene is a bloody battle and it appears realistic. Unfortunately the following scene has two black soldiers chatting with Lincoln outside in a makeshift camp. He's sitting at a table while they discuss their observations with him. Listening to them you'd think they all grew up on the same block together. One soldier lectures Lincoln and interrupts him during their conversation, while the other is Lincolns best buddy. A soldier wouldn't ever talk to a president in 2012 in this manner. In 1865 if two black soldiers acted this way they would have been immediately been put in irons. Blacks had to be extremely deferential interacting with whites during that century because the law looked the other way when they were murdered by whites. The scene is ridiculous. ",2013
10,"Just read some of the ""bad"" reviews & simply just don't get how you can't like this GREAT MOVIE. Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" was AWESOME. The Director was able to take you ""Back In Time"" when things were much simpler & primitive, way back in the 1860's. And Daniel Day Lewis moved me in this film like no other actor has ever done. Mr. Lewis' performance was mesmerizing and spellbinding. He was ""Abraham Lincoln."" His acting in this movie is definitely ""Best Actor/Academy Award Worthy.",2012

6,"'Lincoln' is one of the bigger favorites for Oscar Awards this year and will certainly be one of the heroes of the evening in Hollywood a few weeks from now. It is made by one of the greatest directors of our time, it tells a big American story and features a big American hero, it enjoys some fine acting and is very accurate in searching into history and retrieving a moment and a story that continues to impact the American social and political fabric until today. And yet, 'Lincoln' did not turn to me into a cinema experience to enjoy. Actually something interesting happens with my relation with Steven Spielberg. The film I liked most is one of his first – the very little known Duel, a minimalistic masterpiece, followed by the wonderful Close Encounters  and E.T. I enjoyed the Indiana Jones and The Jurassic Park series for what they are meant to be – great entertainment. However my personal experience with his 'serious stuff' is mixed. While Saving Private Ryan is for me the best war film ever made, and Schindler's List is one of the best in the Holocaust genre, other stuff looks sometimes pretentious, sometimes too naive. As much as he tries to prove, Spielberg cannot do films about any subject, I mean he certainly can, but not all are that good.",2013
5,"After reading approximately 200 books on the subject, Steven Spielberg's politically correct screenwriter, playwright Tony Kushner, decided it would be best to focus on the last four months of President Lincoln's presidency and the fight over the 13th Amendment, rather than covering Lincoln's entire term in office. Apparently, Spielberg concurred, concluding that a full-blown rendering of Lincoln's presidency would be unwieldy and the more narrow focus would perhaps be more dramatically effective. He could have proffered up a three and a half hour spectacle, covering many of the significant bases of Lincoln's political and personal life, beginning with the first Inauguration, with full knowledge that it's been done before quite effectively (Sam Waterston's and Mary Tyler Moore's magisterial performances in the 1988 TV movie adaptation of 'Gore Vidal's Lincoln' come to mind).",2012
8,"American screenwriter, producer and director Steven Spielberg's twenty-eight feature film which he co-produced and which was written by American screenwriter and playwright Tony Kushner, is partly based on a book from 2005 called ""Team of Rivals : The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln"" by American author and historian Doris Kearns Goodwin. It premiered in USA, was shot on locations in the Commonwealth of Virginia, USA and is a US production which was produced by American producer Kathleen Kennedy. It tells the story about the president of the United States of America named Abraham Lincoln who in January, 1865 whilst living with his wife named Molly and son named Bob in the White House in the capital city of USA and as the American Civil War is in its fourth year, does everything in his power to find a peaceful solution regarding the war and encourages his cabinet members to get people from the Democratic Party to vote for the abolishment of slavery.",2013
1,"Spielberg will fill you with more of the dorky, intelligence-insulting, spineless pretentiousness in this movie, which btw he excels at. Instead of being disgusted by thoughtless behavior, characters are constantly caught up in admiration of it. Instead of avoiding self-absorbed, arrogant, belittling, self-diluted, self-righteous mannerisms from them, the audience is forced deep into it, knowing that no one in a Spielberg movie will ever have the good sense to call it out.",2013
1,"Last night we saw a screening of Steven Spielberg's film LINCOLN. I do not plan to see this film again; however I would not discourage anyone from seeing it. As I see it, this film is more of a tribute to Doris Kearns Goodwin's book, ""Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln"", rather than the life and times of Abraham Lincoln. ",2012
10,"This is my first review of a film. I had to do this, because of the effect it had on me. I went to see a screening of ""Lincoln"" last week, and i was wondering if Spielberg could have done it again, like he did years ago with ""Schindler's List"", for example. And he did it, that's for sure. That's not ""Schindler's List"" or ""Saving Private Ryan"", not even close, but this film captures wonderfully the way the director looks at that piece of history, and though it's probably not the more realistic film ever made about Lincoln (and i don't know if there will ever be one really realistic..), the movie offers tremendous performances (DDL will certainly be honored), a tremendous production design and, not less important,a great score by John Williams, once again! So,basically, i was, still, very surprised by the way Spielberg did it, because it shows a very intimate portrait of Lincoln's personality. And i warn you, this is film is for grown ups, not for teenagers looking for some kind of action war movie about leadership and honor in civil war. That's Spielberg in a kind of different but always faith full way, and i hope it earns lot of nominations in the Oscars this year, and i will not be surprised if Lincoln wins Best Picture in January.",2012
2,"I rarely review movies but this one is the epitome of one that you are supposed to ""like"" so everyone says they ""like"" it and the honest truth is (I know I'm the exception)this is a terrible movie. Starting with the most glaring problem, it's boring beyond tears with stilted and rambling dialogue which, if it weren't so boring would be laughable. Acting: it's obvious that Daniel Day-Lewis had no interest in doing this role. His squeaky voice and mannerisms made me think of high school plays I attended when my kids were in school. Sally Field looks and acts like an old and wrinkled Gidget and overacts in her highlight scenes. But, the winner of the most horrible acting in the film goes to Tommy Lee Jones as a Pennsylvania Senator who is nothing more or less than a caricature of Tommy Lee Jones. Historically it's semi-accurate and many people will be surprised to learn that ""Honest Abe"" was anything but. His obsession with getting his way in passing the thirteenth amendment led to his violation of the Constitution, breaking of federal laws and bribing of members of Congress. Hmm, a lot like today though. The saving grace of the film and the only reason I would give it two stars is the outstanding costumes and relative lack of special effects that are usually so obvious and glaring in today's pathetic movies which are designed to make money from our sinking IQs in this country. I wonder if anyone will even try again to make a movie that provokes thought and discussion. Sorry Spielburg, but this is a turkey that arrived just in time for Thanksgiving.",2012
8,"Not usually a fan of Spielberg but I feel he's done a pretty good job here. Not an expert on US history either, nevertheless he seems to get across many of the nuances of the abolitionist movement and the compromises it had to make. There's no use imposing 21st century post- civil rights values on this era, things were more complicated. I can see this movie being used in schools and I expect to return to it to better understand key moments in the birth of the modern United States. It's beautiful to look at too, with top-notch costumes, cinematography and music - and it goes without saying that Day Lewis is superb, and his resemblance to Lincoln uncanny",2015

Mehtunately (a cross between ""unfortunately"" and ""fortunately""), I have read the books and knew what to expect. Unfortunately, I have seen all of the movies, with some different opinions. I found Eclipse to be the best, even though it is quite mediocre. Twilight was too dull, with boring actors, New Moon was just a repeat of that, except with wolves, and Breaking Dawn Part 1 was two hours of three things: 1. Bella and Edward getting married, 2. Bella and Edward having very unessential foreplay that results in a pregnancy, and 3. Bella sitting on a couch moaning and groaning with said pregnancy. I will say I did not have many great expectations for this final installment. But I did see it. It did not raise the bar, nor did it lower it. To me, it was just another Twilight movie.",2012

Admittedly, I am inclined to be negatively critical of movies that are not faithful to the original story or characters on which they are based - especially if I liked the original. I was mildly tolerant of the 4 movies leading up to this one because I felt the important parts of the story lines were there even though the actors didn't measure up to the characters that had formed in my mind from reading the books. This final movie, on the other hand, rushes through the story barely touching on some parts I feel are important, in order to include a culminating scene which is not part of the original story, and which itself has to be absurdly unbelievable to any fan of the book series. Two actors, Lautner and Sheen, do the best they can with the terrible dialoge they were given, but not one other character utters a believable syllable the entire time.

Yes, gone forever is the cheap-shot money-maker that is ""The Twilight Saga"" soap opera. In the latest episode, which amounts to nothing more than an unenthusiastic excuse to showcase every person who was ever in these films and convince us that the ""saga"" was something bigger than it was (it's not), we wave goodbye to all of these things one last time. Sometimes, what looks great in your head as you read it in a book just doesn't work as well on the silver screen. This is a prime example. But sadly, no one really cares.

I don't understand why people (I mean girls) were laughing in between as if dialogs were really ""humorous""!!! When I heard the dialogs I felt like anyone without any professional experience can write such piece of crap. Worst visual effects ever seen. Worst acting.

Even though the acting skills of the major characters have been sad throughout, I have been able to blame that mostly on poor direction and I could find much otherwise to enjoy. But in this final movie of the series, I just feel let down by everyone involved with it: director, actors, script-writers, special effects people, casting, producers (yes, Stephanie Meyer herself is included here!). It had been a long time since I felt cheated out of the price of a movie ticket, but I really regret wasting not only $8 for this one, but also the seemingly interminable 2 hours I lost trying to find some redeeming value while sitting through it.

3,"Twilight is the worst film franchise ever committed to celluloid. As far as I'm concerned, these are the worst successful movies of all time. The movie camera was not invented so that this kind of rubbish could be forced upon so many people! Thankfully, after a weak but not as bad as you remember first one and then 3 horrifying cinematic car crashes (New Moon in particular is one of my 10 least favourite films of all time) it's over at last. The vampire government comes to confront the Cullens about Edward and Bella's child and they try to survive an epic final battle.... which never even happens. The dream battle is admittedly fun, but that's only 5 minutes. The whole film is 2 hours. Most have regarded this as the best of the franchise. Why? It's just as bad as before and can't really be distinguished from the others. The first 20 minutes have some unintentional hilarity as Kristen Stewart turns into an angry CGI vampire but then she went straight faced again.

The movie begins after the birth of Renesmee; Belle and Edward are hot for each other and Jacob creepily has the hots for the baby since he imprinted on her. The Volturi are coming after them because they fear the child is a danger to the life of vampires and can't be controlled, plus it's bad in the vampire world to turn a child. Now does that sound real exciting? So Bella, Edward and the family are going to disappear, then perhaps what is the most perverted scene in a pg13 film, when Jacob strips to turn into a wolf in front of Bella's dad. Jacob does this to keep the family from running away, real sensible, right? So, some vamp tattles on the Cullen family to the Volturi; meanwhile the Cullens gather vampire friends from around the worth to vouch on their behalf that the child isn't a threat. They are afraid the Volturi won't believe that the child is half human and half vamp, which would mean she wasn't a threat, makes perfect sense?

8,i love this film. it does the character of spider-man justice. Andrew Garfield was chosen perfectly as peter parker. After spider-man 3 we needed a change and this is a great fresh take on the character. It is more comic accurate than the Raimi films such as the web shooters and Gwen Stacy as the love interest instead of Mary Jane. I liked the new suit because it looked like a teen could make it. The villain the lizard was a great first foe for spider man. Uncle Bens death scene made me want to cry and Garfields reaction was sad. I love how Gwen comforted him and Flash didn't bully him out of sorrow. i love how peter went from being a vigilante hunting his uncles killer to a hero fighting all crime.,2013

That included a certain super hero movie made by Sami Rami in 2002 where a nerdy guy (Tobey Maguire) gets bitten by a radioactive spider and inherits superhuman powers. If Singer had paved the way, then Rami provided the icing on the cake: a faithful, smart, well-acted super hero flick that had as much heart and sincerity packed in as it had all those set pieces. It also lead to a superior sequel and the much maligned, though underrated, third episode.",2012
8,"Going back a few years when Sam Raimi's Spiderman released it was jaw dropping. It was sort of the spring board for the current excess of superhero films we see now. Most of us were definitively disappointed in Spiderman 3 but disappointed enough that we thought it should end the franchise and encourage a reboot only TWO years later? Fortunately for them the reboot isn't so bad and actually very entertaining and spidey fans won't be disappointed. I don't think its nearly as good as the original Raimi's Spiderman but then at that time it was new and fresh and captivating to see a live action, non-campy superhero on screen. The Amazing Spiderman does manage to make itself different enough to make you not feel like you're watching something you've seen a dozen times over. Its a different spin on the Spiderman story while still keeping key elements firmly in place (maybe Marc Webb should give Zack Snyder a few tips.) They also establish enough back story to make this a lucrative franchise for at least three films if they don't screw it up some way and get it scrapped like they did the first time around. At the same time of being different enough it isn't really that far fetched from Raimi's trilogy. It still has the same feel and intensity and solid special effects. As someone who despises CGI I didn't find it silly or overused (though its clearly used a lot) its done very well including The Lizard who is complete CGI.",2014

8,"Toby Magure was never believable as Spiderman, I mean Stan Lee's Spiderman. He wasn't enough of a smart ass. He was hard to take seriously, he lacked the ability to make his character believable, because maybe he thought the whole superhero/spiderman thing was corny. Andrew Garfield grew up reading the comics, and that comes through. This is not just a rehashing, it's treating Stan Lee's characters and story with the respect they deserve. People really thought Spiderman 3 did Gwen Stacy justice? In Stan Lee's Spiderman Gwen Stacy is his first love, and she's a sweet girl (pretty much what the first three films did with Mary Jane). In the comics Mary Jane is a fiery redhead who's not anything like the Mary Jane in the first 3 spiderman movies. In fact it would make sense for MaryJane not to appear at all in the first 2 or 3 movies. This movie really does a great job of playing out these characters the way they should be played out. I wasn't a fan of the darker look from the trailers but I got over it. Spiderman isn't the avengers, and if you think about all of the arcs in the Spiderman comics you realize that his life is just filled with tragic irony and bittersweet moments. For that reason the dark direction actually makes sense. People saying this isn't as good as the first 3, maybe you haven't watched them in a while. I remember being blown away by Spiderman and Spiderman 2 as a kid. But comic movies have gotten a lot better since then. You've had incredible ones like the Dark Knight and Iron Man and the Avengers. The first three Spiderman movies are over the top with the cheesiness to a degree that should make real Spiderman fans cringe. They made green goblin just the first villain instead of the mastermind behind the rising if other villains. You shouldn't fight the big boss in the first level. Gwen Stacy was an afterthought in the third movie, when Stan Lee has said that Gwen Stacy was supposed to be Spider-man's true love. To sum it up, Amazing Spiderman is a LOT better than those terrible first 3 films, and people who aren't able to see that are blinded by nostalgia.",2014
7,"First off, Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Martin Sheen, Sally Field, and Dennis are all Perfect in their roles. This movie is very different from the original, except for the origins which can obviously not be changed. The action is what spidey fans have always dreamed off. The chemistry between peter and Gwen is priceless. New and interesting story lines are created to be explored through out the trilogy/saga. The new suit is great in my opinion, but it has been changed for the sequel, yet either way I like them both. Andrew Garfield's emotional scenes are unbelievable. Finally, I absolutely loved the humor. And the ending left me satisfied and happy, yet excited for what is yet to come. Overall, this is an origin that succeeds on many levels and out does the previous origin (which is still great) and only Spider-man 2 is equal in its acting, style, humor, action, and theme.",2013

10,SPOILER WARNING:,2014
10,"Initially, like many people, my knee-jerk response to ""The Amazing Spiderman"" (hereafter TAS) was ""unnecessary and redundant"". I felt that Tobey Maguire's interpretation on the famed arachnoid (and Peter Parker) was thoroughly satisfying and complete. Therefore, I didn't bother seeing TAS at the Cineplex. But recently on cable, Encore was periodically showing TAS and, eventually giving into my curiosity, sat down one Saturday morning to give TAS a chance. Now I wish I had seen TAS in the movie theatre. Although it covers the usual Spidey origin trajectory (nerdy but brainy loner, loving aunt/uncle, bite from genetically altered spider, subsequent infusion of powers and confidence, emergence of outlandish but deadly villain), I think TAS does a more touching, affecting, and dare I say it, grittily realistic depiction of Spiderman, and more importantly, Peter Parker.",2013
8,"I have to admit I had low expectations for The Amazing Spider-Man. Yes, I enjoyed the first of Tobey Maguire's outings as Spidey back in 2002 but the quality diminished with each sequel to the point that I didn't care if a fourth installment came to fruition or not. More than anything, it was the feeling I had a mere five years after the last installment, and I'm sure I'm not alone in this, of 'Why another Spider-Man so soon?' However, the decision to return to the timeline of the source comics and introduce Gwen Stacy as Peter Parker's girlfriend (instead of the more familiar Mary Jane Watson) increased the interest. Maybe this would be a new approach. Then the casting of Andrew Garfield intrigued. His superb turns in Never Let Me Go and in the more widely seen The Social Network certainly suggested he may have something new to bring to the part. The trailer clinched it for me, hinting at a Spider-Man Begins leaning. If Christopher Nolan could obliterate the camp, tarnished Adam West Batman with a completely reinvented trilogy, what could director Marc Webb (500 Days of Summer) create with The Amazing Spider-Man? It's not Batman Begins, let's get that straight immediately. Nolan's trilogy stands head and shoulders above all other superhero films at the moment and is unlikely to be dethroned any time soon. But The Amazing Spider-Man is a huge success and an extremely enjoyable first foray into Spidey world by all involved and this is down to some fine writing by James Vanderbilt (who has just penned next year's RoboCop reboot) and the courage of Webb not to rush into the action and villain chasing too soon.",2012

While I really did like Raimi's 2002 initial Spidey flick, I absolutely loathed the incredibly overpraised 2004 sequel. Thankfully, there is a bit more debate about which film is actually better, because I've always been in the small camp that believes Spiderman 1 is better than Spiderman 2. Part 2 regressed all the good will that Raimi built up in 1. And there is pretty much universal agreement that 3 isn't very good. But I still contend that 2 SUCKS. The huge difference that I already see in this 2012 reboot that is better than anything from the 2000s trilogy is that while the Raimi flicks TRIED and FAILED to have emotion and depth in telling the story of Peter Parker/Spiderman, Webb's reboot actually SUCCEEDS! TAS stars the pretty ""amazing"" newcomer Andrew Garfield (who was superb in The Social Network) as the well-known iconic character of Peter Parker/Spiderman. Peter is a bullied nerd whose parents mysteriously left him with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May (superbly played by acting legends Martin Sheen and two-time Oscar winner Sally Field) as a child.",2013
9,"This movie was utterly fantastic ! I seriously loved it, ignore all the haters, these people just can't get over the fact that This film was superior to Spider-Man 2002. It is a 'realistic', contemporary and a grounded approach onto the Character by the Director Marc Webb, yet staying faithful to its source materials( combo of The Amazing and The Ultimate Story lines). Of course, there are a couple of plot holes, but I am sure they'll be explained in the upcoming Sequel. I Must say that Andrew Garfield brought justice to the role of Spider-Man. An absolutely amazing and a highly gripping movie. I highly refer it to any True Spider-Man Fan, as the people who have never read the comics might call it a 'rehash' of the First Spiderman movie, but actually, this movie stayed fairly true to the comics from the beginning to the end. ",2013
10,"I really enjoyed this movie. It brings new life to the franchise of THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN. It goes in great depth of how Peter Parker turns into SPIDERMAN. I mean it wasn't fake looking, like the high school looked as if it were real because in some movies you say that is nothing like how high school is like but it was portrayed very well. Then when he was making his web shooters you just saw all these blue prints and you saw him make. You can tell that this SPIDERMAN is closer to the one in the comics. Although the suit wasn't the same you can role with it. But the plot was well written and for once the girl friend was never kept hostage. The acting was really good Andrew Garfield is (29 or 30) Emma Stone is (24 or 25) in real life in there acting made you believe they were actually 17. There's a lot of kissing scenes but you know what who cares that is what makes you believe there young. The LIZARD was well done and everything made you think that this really could happen (cross genetics.) Screw the critics this is an awesome movie and if your a Spidey fan you will love it. P.S. They have really good songs chose too.",2013
9,"I admit that I too didn't exactly get that excited when I heard that this was in the making. The Sam Raimi trilogy was a fun ride, and the idea of making another Spider-Man movie with a completely new cast seemed strange and unnecessary. When the cast was announced, I got a little bit curious, but nothing more.",2012
10,"""Spoiler Warning Just to be Safe!!!"" I liked the original three Spiderman films as much as anybody, if not more, but I really feel like they did an amazing job with this reboot. I may be in the minority, but I feel like this film did a great job at handling Peter's change from nerd to hero. Every character in this film felt human, and every actor did a fantastic job with their respective characters. A lot people keep comparing this to the original three films, and even more are saying that they should of just made a fourth film instead of reboot...I disagree. This film didn't reinvent the story, nor did it switch it up much but what it did do was make the characters more relatable and made this A lot closer to the comics, although it still isn't exactly like the comics. One of my main gripes about the original Spiderman film was a petty one, I'll admit that, but it got addressed and was fixed in this one. That would be the fact the Parker actually has to make his web shooters in this one whereas in the original the spider bite gave him his power to shoot webs. Now for the villain...while The Lizard obviously has nothing on The Green Goblin, I feel like he was a great choice for the film. While, yes Goblin is iconic, I feel that he should be the main focus in the movie he appears and not given a side role for over half the movie which they would of had to do in an origin story such as this one. A lot of people were upset about the CGI limiting The Lizar's movement,and I can honestly say it didn't bother me one bit. In fact I would prefer the CGI over some guy running around in a lizard costume...that wouldn't be very menacing now would it? In conclusion, I feel like this reboot was justified and in my humble and honest opinion proved to be BETTER than any of the original three Spiderman films, except for possibly the second one... Cannot wait for TSM2 to come out!",2012
8,"This is a new origin tale of Spider-Man and how he came to be. Rather than action driven sequences, The Amazing Spider-Man consistently uses the strengths of its actors to create a compelling story and characters the audience cares about. Columbia pictures not only told me we are indeed ready to re-visit Spider-Man's Universe, but ready to finally do it right in the process.",2012
7,"After five years of waiting, finally showed up the greatest hero of all the time!Different of the other comics, Peter is trying to find the truth about his parents and one day he finds a clue which leads to ""Oscorp"" where his father worked with Dr.Curt Connors. There, Peter is bitten by a radioactive spider. He discovers he has super strength, spider sense, agility, and other stuff.",2013
9,"The Amazing Spider-Man came out in 2012, but I only saw it about a year after it's release, but before Amazing Spider-Man 2 came out in theaters. I enjoyed Andrew Garfield allot more than Tobey Maguire's performance as both Peter Parker and Spider-Man. Andrew had the wise crack of Spider-Man because if you read the comics or watch any of the cartoons, you'll see Spider-Man as a wise cracker and as Peter Parker, he has nerdy, but he is more than just a nerd. He was also a teenager who had friends. Emma Stone was a much better romantic lead than Kristen Dunst. And I thought the action was much better than the first Spider-Man. Overall, I give The Amazing Spider-Man a 9 out of 10, a fantastic movie.",2014
8,"I know people spidey fans will disagree with what I am about to say but i think that the original spider man trilogy is like avatar in the sense that they are good movies but are completely over rated. they don't have anything on other superhero films such as say The Dark Knight trilogy, The reason why I preferred the new one was because it was less corny and more satisfying than the originals. The only part I was disappointed with was the fact that peter parkers school bully became his friend at the end, because I was glad to see how they made peters bully was sorry for beating him up when it came to a life and death matter but when he became his friend it was taken to far and felt to corny. other than that it was defiantly worth seeing.",2013
10,"I have never felt as driven to make sure other people understood just how perfect a show was. Not for Game of Thrones, Firefly, Sopranos or any of the other shows I obsess about. But this show changed that! This show boils down everything that is wrong with America and puts out a simple answer to solving that. DO THE BLOODY NEWS LIKE IT'S NEWS NOT A HIGH SCHOOL PROM ELECTION! ",2012
10,"I've been watching television for all of my 57 years on the planet. It is a rare thing when I see a show that grabs me from the first moments and holds me to my chair until the very last, but this just happened tonight as I watched the first episode of The Newsroom. Brilliant writing, terrific characters, excellent dialog, smooth and sexy directing that organically brought all the pieces together, and there couldn't have been better casting. Every character just felt exactly right. When it was over, I said this will be the new West Wing. Jeff Daniels shines in this role and what a great opportunity to showcase his effortless acting. I can easily see major Hollywood ""A"" listers grabbing their telephone's right now making late Sunday night calls to their agents demanding they get a guest appearance on The Newsroom. I was hoping for good when I heard about this show last winter, but what was delivered was excellence. Well done HBO. You've got me hooked. Well done!",2012
10,"In the tradition of his earlier 'behind-the-scenes of TV' shows, Aaron Sorkin's The Newsroom takes a hard (and witty) look at the behind the scenes of cable news. And like all his other shows, The Newsroom deals as much with themes of honour, ethics, loyalty, idealism and love, as it does with the news. It's also written in Sorkinese – Aaron Sorkin's fast-paced, back-and-forth, sing-song dialogue that'll leave you heady on a good day but with a headache on a bad one. ",2012
9,"Rarely does a television show come along and sweep you off your feet with brilliant writing, an amazing cast and an actual message that is relevant and inspirational. Aaron Sorkin has done it again with The Newsroom! This show is truly a display of what television can achieve if we have the right people who are willing to break the rules of the mundane drab to make an engaging and intelligent show. ",2012
10,"Maybe I am just coming into adulthood after my 45 years, but The Newsroom has always been food for thought. The pace, direction and writing has been excellent. I have watched and re-watched every episode over the past 3 seasons and really can't understand why they would cancel this show for the ages. First I was not a person that watched West Wing. I was younger and dumber for the show to stick. this show grabbed me from the get go and I have never been more surprised with it's greatness.",2014
10,"A new series launched on HBO with a star-spangled episode 'We just decided to'. As conceived and written by Aaron Sorkin it is a timely, incredibly intelligently written show populated with some of our best seasoned actors as well as some very fine actors on the way up. This is the kind of television that reminds us that at one time the news programs informed us about current events and ran a continuing commentary on the development of events in this country and around the world in a manner that kept us alerted of why we as a nation needed to remain alert to both good and bad events, to celebrate when indicated and to fight back when injustices were occurring. This direction is indicated in the background imagery for the titles – running glimpses of the likes of Walter Cronkite, Edward R Murrow, Huntley/Brinkley etc who were responsible news anchors instead of the flippant celebrities more concerned with ratings of their show than the news we see today.",2012
10,"I've been waiting for what seems like forever for a top notch show to present itself, and I truly feel this is it. To say the first show was riveting is a gross understatement. As a news show, this fictitious newsroom had me planted on the edge of my seat, and when things finally got going, I found myself fidgeting and wide-eyed waiting for what came next. I have to say the leads in this show have amazing chemistry, the sort of chemistry that usually takes several shows to develop, yet here it was, in spades no less. It's easy to believe that I'm overstating this, but I truly believe this show has the potential for greatness, and believe me, I'm normally a fairly harsh critic, but in this case I feel completely justified in touting this as the next great show. There's some great social commentary on offer here, while not exactly new, it's offered up in a far more palatable fashion than the usual polarised and emotional manner. Needless to say, I implore all to watch this first episode, as it was so good, it could have been stretched another 30 minutes to become a great movie. The fact that we get more, is the icing on the cake. I can only hope the writers can keep producing scripts near the same level as this one. 5 stars, or 10 out of 10. Watch it!",2012
9,"I watched this show after watching True Blood, which I watch out of habit on Sunday nights with my wife. I am SO glad we kept HBO on. I remember hearing about this show from different promos and snippets of interviews on the computer, but wow. Aaron Sorkin leaves his mark all over this show, right from the intro, which was very reminiscent of The West Wing right until the ending. Fantastic creation by him.",2012
10,"I watch a lot of TV shows and I have to say that The Newroom has impressed. Quick witted, fast paced and dealing with issues that exist in American news coverage and to some extent beyond. The main characters were engaging and their interactions into the future will be interesting to see as well. ",2012
10,"I love this show. I watch a lot of TV, not all good, but this is far and away my favourite. ",2014
5,"Several years ago, Aaron Sorkin created a show called ""Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip."" I enjoyed this show a lot. It wasn't as good as ""The West Wing,"" but it wasn't real bad.",2012
10,"THIS IS THE MOST EXCITING SHOW I HAVE SEEN ON T.V. SINCE ""THE WEST WING.""",2012
2,"First of all I know this is American drama and that emotions are a key component of such products. Second, I expect the characters to be somewhat believable and somewhat likable. While most comments on IMDb that dislike this program are about the perceived left-wing bias, my criticism is that all the characters seem to be on day-release from intense psychotherapy. If they are not, they certainly should be getting therapy. Everybody seems unable to deal with who they are, and what others do around them. Everyone gets upset at the slightest action of another. Everyone is either maudlin, fearful, or angst-ridden. They have the emotional response of emo teenagers. And this does not for good drama make. You have to care about characters in order to be involved and feel for them. Instead, we are subjected to children in big bodies who are eminently unlovable. This is the worst of American drama. While I understand that HBO made this for an American audience, it is so self-absorbed as to make Paris Hilton look positively interesting. The newsroom? Oooh! Television! Wow. And people get upset! Fascinating. And there are real stories as well. I mean real stories! How can you not want to watch it? It's not even boring, it's painfully masturbatory. It is so full of its own self-importance as be an exercise in politics. While some might like it because it is 'socially relevant' the script means that you are constantly being subjected to trauma. Ugh!",2012
6,Firstly overall I think this show is well done. There are a few issues that bug me.,2012
10,"In the nature of entertainment on television, In that it must somehow appeal to the masses and also must inexorably fail to put those people with half a brain asleep, this show failed miserably.",2014
9,"I thought that the first ten minutes of the first episode would be the most intense and best ten minutes of the entire show. Oh boy was I wrong. This show has exceeded my expectations by constantly bringing you fresh original suspense in a form that you wouldn't have expected it. I found myself constantly on the edge of my seat wondering how the team was going to overcome each mountain of problems. Other then the brilliantly written script and storyline, the acting is phenomenal by everyone. Not once was I disappointed by an actors portrayal of their character in this show.",2015
10,it's really rare to find a show that clicks from the get go and stays good throughout its run. The Newsroom did it.,2015
1,"I signed up just to review this show, but not to review it so much as to respond to another review who commented ""THIS IS HOW THE NEWS SHOULD BE DONE!!!"" (Not really a quote, but pretty close.) I felt exactly as this reviewer did after the first episode and a half. The opening scene was outstanding. The seen where Mac is laying out the new format and rules had me cheering.",2012
2,"When I saw the first episodes I thougth WOW, what a fantastic new show, the covering of all the dramatic events in the past years, the research behind it and how a news channel works was very interesting and entertaining. I guess this is also the reason why all the positive reviews here are from June, because the show was really good back then. Sadly it changed after the first episodes and now it is only a Republican bashing show which has some love stories going on to add some drama. All these love stories are pathetic....come on.....also Mackenzie sometimes acts like a 12 year old....and what the hell why are the Republicans and the Tea Party the ONLY topic in this show?? No one believes that Will is a true Republican, this fact should just make the bashing legal because he is one of them....but its just embarrassing. I really can say this because I'm not from USA, I'm not a Democrat nor a Republican and for me as a neutral viewer this is already extremely annoying.",2012
5,"I have no idea how this show is currently rated 8,8 on this site. It's a perfectly viewable show, there was after all bound to be some quality here given the creator of the show. The main problem for me however is the soap opera level acting. It's really quite shocking, and not at all what you would expect from HBO.",2012
5,"The reason I starting watching Newsroom is seeing Will's rant from Episode 1 on Youtube. It's quite good, and points out a lot of America's problems.",2012
10,This is one of the best television programmes I've ever seen. Mr. Sorkin needs to be lauded for the brilliance of the subject matter and the style used to convey it! This series ranks with Yes Prime Minister and The West Wing. Only David Kelly's Boston Legal comes close. He singles out both of the political parties using current events and dissects the crux of the underlying problems. It appears one sided against the GOP but they do have more loonies. They also have far more entertaining characters than the Democrats. ,2014
10,"I'm sorry to sound as if I'm preaching, but here goes anyway. ",2013
10,"I first came to this show as a fan of the Vampire Diaries, following Daniel Gillies. I have never before been a big fan of the medical drama genre in general. However, all it took was one episode, and I was completely hooked, and become moreso with each show. Saving Hope draws you in with the wonderful characters, emotions, dialogue, drama, and humor. From just being a Daniel Gillies fan, I've become a fan of the entire cast. ",2012
10,"From the creative team that brought us the hit Canadian summer series ""Rookie Blue"" comes ""Saving Hope"", a new hospital drama with a supernatural twist. Boasting the same high quality ensemble cast and plenty of star power, it features the trio of Erica Durance (Smallville), Michael Shanks (Stargate SG-1) & Daniel Gillies (The Vampire Diaries). The hook to this series is not that it's a medical drama, or even the premise of one of the leads living in a parallel universe of sorts while in a coma. What makes ""Saving Hope"" a winner are the characters who roam the halls of Hope Zion. A diverse group of charismatic heroes, each with their own virtues, flaws and most importantly, heart.",2012
10,"I am totally hooked on Saving Hope. This is not an easy thing to achieve by a TV show, mind you. It has been years since I regularly followed anything on the tube. But finally I found a show that has really good actors, it is well made, has entertaining stories, and features compelling characters. In other words, it is a high quality program that can be heart-wrenchingly dramatic, wittingly ironic, and yes, sappy and emotional too when necessary. While the set up of the show is not all together original--what medical show can be so by now?--each episode avoids being predictable. The subtle turns, the character growth, and the interesting challenges all make me care for what happens to the diverse characters in Saving Hope. As an extra element, many of the members of the cast are often on twitter and freely interact with their fans. The fandom of this show is amazing, so one can watch the show and be part of a very dynamic online community.",2012
10,"I will admit, I came from a Stargate SG-1 background, so naturally I already fell in love with Michael Shanks. His performance is no less than flawless, as it has been in past shows and even low budget movies. His presence is great and just makes the show for me. It is sort of a mix of the ""Grey's Anatomy""'s medical problems and a hint of ""Awake"". The only thing that does not remind me of another show, is that this show is AMAZING. I have cried for good and bad in every episode so far, and I believe that will continue but I don't mind. It is a tear-jerker for sure, but again I don't mind. The other great aspects of the show, are the excellent cast. Erica Durance and Daniel Gillies are the other main characters and their performance is no less than stunning either. Personally, there is not a single part of ""Saving Hope"" that I do not enjoy week after week, even five shows in. I have the want after every episode, to watch the next, then the next day, I watch the episode again on Hulu. No negative comments. I will be severely hurt if this show doesn't last a while.",2012
10,"So, I'm 59 years old. I have seen just about every medical drama ever on TV, going back to Medical Center with hunky Chad Everette. What a wonderful medical drama with a twist this is! Full of real life feelings and doubts and every gender or racial concern under the sun this series touches on. And then something extra... ",2015
10,"Saving Hope is a rare gem of a show. It not only brings the medical world to life, but also the often overlooked dilemmas which medics,patients and loved ones battle with as life is saved or lost on a daily basis.Not for this show the slick, ultra cool over production of many USA dramas,this show is driven by the emotions. Story and character come first which gives this show a more humane feel. There is a reality, both in the writing and the performances of the actors which drags you into the show and you feel actual empathy with them.",2012
10,"I'll admit that what first peeked my interest in this show was Michael Shanks. As a HUGH Shanks fan I'd happily listen to him read the phone book. However, I'm not a fan of medical dramas, so I was not expecting to become as gripped in the storyline of Saving Hope as I fast became. Though I could tell from the trailer that this show was going to be good I was not expecting it to be GREAT! Each week I (and many others from the UK) stayed up until 3am to watch the show stream live, completely hocked with the gripping and heartfelt story lines. Erica Durance's performance moved me to tears (not an easy task I can tell you) more than once and the on screen chemistry between her and Shanks is top rate. One moment I'm giggling, next gasping in shock and the next tearing up. This show has something for everyone. Whether you're into medical dramas, supernatural story lines, mushy ""love trying to over come the odds"" plot lines, or simply enjoy good writing and quirky characters, this show has it all. I would highly recommend Saving Hope to anyone.",2012
9,"I personally find this show very entertaining and demonstrates reliable emotions that occur in everyday life. The actors are excellent choices and the directing is flawless. The plot is well written and demonstrates life for doctors and patients, and the problems they face on a daily bases. But it also focuses on the fiction of what a person may think they are experience while being in a coma. ""Saving Hope"" is an exciting drama, that allows the watchers to expand their knowledge on medical procedures (eg. various surgeries). I personally think many people will enjoy this TV series especially if you have watched and enjoyed shows like ""Grey's Anatomy"", ""ER"" etc.. This show is available to buy on DVD and can also be found on the CTV website. You won't regret watching ""Saving Hope"".",2013
5,I was hooked at first but the storyline is now really stupid. So Alex loved Charlie so much but said no to his proposal?? She can't lose him but yet decides to leave him? She loved him but it was so easy to break it off and already ready to date? Really? Wow. What are these writers thinking?? Unrealistic. It just doesn't make sense. I don't watch it anymore.,2017
10,"After siphoning through many of the other Medical dramas out there, and being mostly disappointed with not really finding one that can keep you interested, I stumbled upon Saving Hope. Having been a pretty big Stargate nerd I noticed Michael Shanks, and thought I would give it a shot. Then I also noticed Erica Durance which as it happens I was also a pretty big Smallville nerd. So I was pretty excited to watch this now. The first episode was great. The acting was excellent. Erica as Dr. Reid is very moving. She is, for me, on a level above the rest of the show's characters. Not knocking the rest of the cast but she feels more engrossed in the role as the others. I have seen actors get Emmys for much worse showings. Michael Shanks is also very good. I honestly wish they would have more scenes with the two of them. You can sense real chemistry between them. ",2012
3,"I have been watching Saving Hope from the beginning and loved it. However, now it seems Homosexuals are top priority. Is it really necessary to portray that? I seriously doubt that hospitals have that many doctors and patients that are ""gay""?????? Please consider limiting that and get back to a basic great hospital series. On a more positive not, I love how Saving Hope shows that Doctors (mostly) are very concerned about patients and try every means possible to help and save them. The chemistry between different Doctors is great also.....also, the forgiveness shown, emotions on all levels. The acting is incredible.",2016
10,"Great show, love the way they film it, amazing actors and one of the best show on TV!",2012
7,"Well how much can you expect from a medical drama !!! Here is the catch this show does not revolve around a single patient or a doctor, it is very well balanced considering the other characters apart from Erica Durance.I had really high hope from Erica Durance's character after seeing her perform amazingly in Smallville, many might think she can not completely come out from the Lois Lane character but she proved everyone wrong.She is an amazing actress and Saving Hope might be saved by her.On the other hand Michael Shanks plays his part quite well considering hes in a coma and his spirit walking around the Hospital.Daniel Gillies also plays an important role in the show who is actually quite funny.But then again when you see Erica Durance on the show she just catches the spotlight.",2012
5,"Liked it but all these years with charlie and alex, and now the break up again and start up interacial relationship. On top of that her problem is with hes gift. So I am done with this show because the writers and dragging it out too far and I cannot deal with it.",2017
10,"i think this is amazing TV series.maybe not perfect but i cant say its bad. because of its atmosphere and Durance E. :) i can watch later,not on TV. But hospital life is totally true in this series.and its about save life,its worthy purpose.Of course it includes valuable cast.And sorry about my English :) actually i wonder ,how will it go?ghostly things,emotions and feelings are here.i wish i watch same time and on TV.or i wish i watch on internet but same time.yeah,we are followers and we must support yours.",2012
9,"Considering that I love to spend my free time watching medical dramas with a twist of supernatural, I really can't comprehend how I've missed Saving Hope so far. Being a moderate Stargate SG-1 fan, it's quite natural that Michael Shanks brought me here, but while I was expecting another fairly drama-packed, standardised medical show, I was quite surprised to see a really good character development. And while I resisted in the beginning, I'm really enjoying the dedication of Alex, the reserved but caring demeanor of Joel, the quirkiness of D-r Hamza and the amusing yet adorable way that Charlie deals with his gift/curse.",2016
1,"5% fascinating, 95% fluff.",2013
10,"I will readily admit that I only started watching Saving Hope because of my love of The Vampire Diaries and Daniel Gillies, who plays Elijah Mikaelson. However, the pilot awed me to the point where I watched in three times after it originally ran. I had never seen anything with either Erica Durance or Michael Shanks in it, but I am pleasantly surprised by their superb acting abilities. I find myself hoping every Thursday night that this will be the week that Charlie wakes up, that he and Alex will be able to get married and continue their lives together. It's an amazingly well-written medical drama that keeps me on the edge of my seat and I cry during almost every episode. Needless to say, I'm overjoyed that Saving Hope was given the go-ahead for a second season!",2012

10,"As a retired nurse of 50 years, I have watched every medical show from Medic with Richard Boone to the present ones. Somewhere I missed Saving Hope tho until recently, when I found it on ION. I came in early in season 2,but was able to catch up on season 1 on line. I was hooked before the first episode ended. I never watched Stargate or Smallville so was not familiar with the actors portraying Charlie and Alex but immediately felt they were not just actors in a part, they WERE Charlie and Alex. They are excellent! As a nurse, I've seen a lot of hospital ""life"" and what goes on with both patients, and staff, and Saving Hope is right, on both counts. The story lines for the entire cast are believable, because it's life in a hospital, and who knows how many souls are wandering around the halls, trying to ""right"" their lives, before they pass on to a better place? I read all the reviews, even spoilers, and was sorry to find Joel dies at the end of season 3. I will miss him, but am sure the writers will continue to keep me glued to my TV.",2016
3,I started watching this after seeing a main actor (Dr. Miller) in another program. The first season got me hooked on the show. I really liked Charlie and Alex and was looking forward to see what happened.,2017

5,"I had read about this show a wile back and it sounded pretty cool. I also welcome something new with familiar actors from previous cool shows. And it was interesting right until the moment Charley got his (lasting) outer body experience. Instead of exploring that, what was supposed to be different from other shows, he got shoved to the background and the show turned into a plain old boring hospital show narrated here and there by a ghost.",2012
10,"Don't let the name fool you. The name makes the show sounds very weird, which it isn't at all. The actors are very good, and the characters are very entertaining. The plots are also very entertaining, and not as predictable as the other Disney shows, which is wonderful. I was pleasantly surprised that Disney made a good show. They've been making some very bad shows lately, but this one was a home run! I'm in love with the characters. Bree is so cute, Adam is such an idiot and everything he says is so unbelievably stupid and funny, and Chase is such a know it all. He reminds me of Justin from Wizards of Waverly Place. Overall, this show was a pleasant surprise, and very different than the rest of the typical Disney shows. I love Lab Rats! Give it a chance! It's so funny!",2013
9,"""LAB RATS,"" in my opinion, is an excellent Disney XD show. I watch it with my 9-year-old nephew from time to time. I always smile and laugh whenever a mishap occurs. One of the funniest mishaps I've ever seen occur on the show is when Leo (Tyrel Jackson Williams) gets shrunk. Another thing that makes this show funny is Donald's (Hal Sparks) comic relief. If you ask me, he always know just what to say and do to make the audience laugh. The writing is always strong, the performances are always good, and everything else about the show is good.Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that if you don't have basic digital cable channels, you should get them. Now, in conclusion, I hope this will be on Disney XD for many years yet.",2014
10,"Lab Rats is hands-down the most entertaining Disney XD show out there in my opinion. Lab Rats has a great combination of comedy, adventure and superpowers. The name may not do the series justice and might give you know idea on what the series is about. But Lab Rats has an awesome plot.",2014
10,"Lab Rats is one of those rare Disney shows where everybody on the cast has ""It"". The kids, the parents , the supporting, they're all perfectly cast. Even the house security bot is hilarious, ""he"" has some of the best one liners on the show. Luckily, all of the actors are great in their roles instead of just one funny kid surrounded by duds (like on a lot of Disney sets). The writing is consistent and funny, and it carries the show instead of just gimmicks. And the characters are actually written for which allows the actors to show some range. It's great the show actually has a continuing sub-plot with the Evil Davenport brother that should carry it through seasons. I hope this is one Disney series that goes on for years, and none of the kids decides they want to be the next Britney or Justin and gets the show canceled after a couple of seasons.",2013
8,"Lab Rats is a pretty great show, especially coming from the live action department of Disney. It's my third favorite Disney XD show, preceded by Gravity Falls and Phineas and Ferb.",2015
10,"Love this show! In each episode the funniest person is either Eddy the security system or Leo the non-bionic human. I like everyone but my favourite character has to be Chase, who has super smarts so basically, he's the smartest guy on the Earth although, his ego can take over like Mr Davenport (aka Donald) who also has a big ego. In Commando App, we find out that Chase has a Commando app which allows him to be Spike who is a cocky, fearless soldier who comes when Chase is feeling threatened or in danger. Spike made his last appearance in Spikes Got Talent. In Leo's Jam, Bree glitches when she is trying to dance with Ethan, her crush. Sometimes when Adam angered, he loses control of his heat vision. I would totally recommend this show to friends who just love comedy. I never miss a episode because I just love it and love seeing all the action on Disney XD.",2014
7,"This is a pretty funny show. I like all the characters. Davenport is a bit hard to believe as an adult genius since has so many emotional issues to overcome but this is rated for a really young audience which lets me out. Leo does get a little tiring as the screw up who continually screws up time after time. He does come through when things get to crunch time though. Since this show is rated TV7 I make allowances for some of the hackneyed, juvenile antics that crop up from time to time. Overall I do enjoy watching the episodes. The computer programmed house butler,Eddy, is a nice sarcastic and jealous addition to the series. Of course I don't know how a program can get jealous but oh well.",2013

10,"Lab Rats, before I begin to list the amount of things this show did to entertain me in every possible way, let me just start of with the roles/characters of this TV Show.... Tyrel Jackson Williams (Leo Dooley), amazing actor and some how made me entertained with 4 Seasons, people may see Tyrel as a person who came to set with 0 ability or knowledge, but I think Tyrel would be a perfect actor in different Movies and TV Shows, the Jokes, timing, thinking, everything Tyrel managed to do is amazing. Next up, role wise, Is Hal Sparks, once again almost amazing actor the way Hal managed to once again prove to me that this TV Show is honestly amazing... I don't really care what age a person can be... I would still enjoy the show. Once I saw that Lab Rats was over, I was honestly sad... and this had never happen to me before 2012-2016 Is a very long time to be continuing a show... I thought that the TV show wouldn't end for a while but I guess I was wrong... Watching the Actors/Actresses grow up was amazing... Tyrel aka Leo Dooley is currently 19 in 2017 which means back in 2012 he was 14 or 13 maybe even 12 when he actually started the show. I've recently watch over the entire TV Show over again and watching them grow up was amazing. The TV Show producers picked the right people to make a TV Show with. In the long run I really enjoyed the TV Show 10/10",2017
10,Even though its ended that's sad and I wonder why I know it's the only season 4 rule.,2016
5,"I have very mixed feelings about Lab rats because in season one, Leo was such a nuisance and always ruined things in the lab. Bree, Chase and Adam are such brats and jerks to Leo in the later seasons. Lab rats became very interesting in season 4. I hate chase but his acting is great. Adam was a little bit smarter in season one. Eddy was such a nuisance. The only characters I liked were Tasha and Donald Davenport. I hate Bree who acts all high and mighty. I loved the missions and action only. Principal Perry was tolerable and her acting was awesome. Douglas was another character that was just there. I feel like Tasha didn't have more screen time. Leo was under appreciated a lot because he saved the Lab rats lives so much and they acted like such jerks toward him. In season 4, Chase told Leo that he wasn't ready to become a mentor which I felt like that was just rude because Chase is over emotional, competitive, has no patience and just plain petty. Leo is more capable than Chase will ever be.",2016
10,"Having finished ""Kickin It,"" which I wish Disney would renew, I decided to watch Lab Rats next. I'm going to watch every Disney show that a lot of people say are horrible, and so far, I'm loving these shows.",2016

3,"This show is pure garbage and while every immature 5 year old may love it, the show is full of bad acting, immature jokes and the jerk that is principle perry. the show hardly qualifies as a show. Its predictable and repetitive with Adam playing stupid the whole time and all of the jokes about chase being short or Adam being too dumb to understand the jokes chase makes. Chase is a complete jerk, Donald Davenport and Adam are the definitions of overplayed characters with Donald being a complete man child and Adam being a clueless moron, the show also has some offensive anti-feminist jokes aimed at Bree. Kelli Berglund is the only semi-acceptable actor in the main cast. Principle Perry isn't nice on any level between the writers thinking their funny by making perry make offensive and stupid jokes aimed at the student body, such as calling her students meat bags and wastes of oxygen.",2014
3,"Lab Rats certainly had potential, or at least it sounded kind of cool at first glance, but it's terrible! I put it on for my little brother and we both agreed that if kids are entertained by this show, there must be a stupidity virus going around. The acting was awful, and for the most part the characters are cardboard cutouts of today's typical cell phone-toting, texting addict teens. No one is original in the show, no one has individuality. And come on, Bree? This inventor creates a superpowered human and names her Bree? That name was trendy around the time this show came out, but naming one of the characters Bree was pretty lame. The soundtrack to the show is horrible, unless you're into Hannah Montana-esque pop songs you'll hate listening to the music in this. The title made the show seem much more original than it really is.",2015

10,"Congratulations to Spanish cinema by presenting us with yet another thriller / mystery spectacular without showing explicit sex, as we have seen in some Spanish films. The movie is great! The way that every thriller should be: it leaves you lost, but arrives somewhere. And this place is beyond the obvious. The atmosphere of suspense and tension remains, and we are honored by the environment's main plot: nothing less than a morgue! The unwinding of the film is fantastic, amazing and high quality. The Spanish film hardly disappoints me. This one does not disappoint at any time. We watch unblinking eyes and is surprised as the quality of the excellent climate of suspense.

The corpse has been taken to the morgue without a postmortem, but has mysteriously disappeared. The morgue security- guard Torres (Miquel Gelabert) has been scared out of his wits - so much so that he runs out of the building and is knocked down by a car. Inspector Jaime Peña (José Coronado) investigates the crime, but finds the task difficult as he is still plagued by the memory of his wife's death a decade earlier in a hit-and-run accident. Sometimes his emotions get the better of him.",2014

Not much to comment on the plot. A body from the morgue goes missing and a detective is onto it . That is the story. Plenty of undetectable twists .The mother of all twists is the last scene. That hits one after another and on the face. Enjoyed this thoroughly. Very good background music score. Very good photography and cinematography. Very good screen play.

I like these kind of movies, because you feel like you are trying to be a detective as well and trying to figure out what the hell is going on. This is the case with The Body, a movie that will have you gripping your seat trying to find the answers for the entire duration of the movie. And you probably won't, until it is revealed. And when it is, well I won't lie it really has that been there, done that feeling. No spoilers but it seems it borrowed a lot from Usual Suspects, but the things that actually unfold seem a bit unrealistic. I didn't buy the ending, which is the weaker part of the movie you could say. But still, solid entertainment coming from a Spanish production.",2015
9,"One of the best Mystery ""suspense"" thriller of all time!! Be it Acting, screenplay, direction, background score, an amazing movie! The Body, a really good thriller, and its mentioning as Hitchcock style is not too far off. Its music was also akin to The Shining, but in the way that it perfectly fit the scene.. Now since I won't go into depth about the story, its only fair that I tell you that this movie really pays off in the end, so don't write it off if some of it doesn't make sense. Besides, watching Álex freak out at each clue is truly worth it all on its own. What initially caught my eye about this film was the mention Hitchcock-style psychological thriller.

Sure, it was plagued with problems, but for me, it's a serious guilty pleasure. But that's another review for another time. ",2012

I didn't walk out of the theater with a feeling like ""OMG, that movie kicked ass!"".

4,"Although Clash of the Titans was universally dismissed as an overwhelming disappointment – and featured the worst post-converted 3D ever – it raked in the big bucks and a sequel was naturally green-lit by Warner Bros. With a new director (Battle LA's Jonathan Liebesman replacing Louis Leterrier) and an extra $25m to toy with, Wrath was given the opportunity to learn from its predecessor's mistakes. Alas, this loud and sporadically entertaining mess largely fails to deliver; Sam Worthington's acting again doesn't cut the mustard, the action is well-choreographed but repetitive, and the CGI remains below par considering the dosh thrown at it. However, it's the lack of imagination and unpredictability in the plot department that truly stifles the proceedings. If you get to the end of the first act and don't already know how the rest of the movie is going to play out, you're probably sleeping. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes spice things up as Zeus and Hades respectively, and Toby Kebbell's comic sidekick is a successful ploy to inject the humour sorely missing from Clash, but it's not enough to make this misfire recommendable.",2012

All the characters played their roles very well especially Zeus and Hades. The version I saw was 3d, and the use of it was much better this time around scenes with falling rocks, Pegasus flying, and other scenes had a strong presence with the 3d. A couple weaknesses I saw in my opinion were the character representations of Hephestus and Hades toward the end. Hephestus was seemed to be way scrawnier, too good looking, not serious enough, and too weak for a god. He was a solid character just wish they made him more represented to how he was in myth. Also without spoiling the character change of Hades toward the end was a little interesting, but felt it shouldn't have been done. The effects were in this movie were awesome especially for Cronus.

Yes, there are many ways to ""bent"" and a movie, and most can be understood and respected.

While little could be done to cushion the drop in quality that was bound to come with well, anything, that followed that near-masterpiece of action, Jeremy Renner makes an apt substitute and the thrills, wit and set pieces are all top notch, even if it won't quite have audiences asking, ""Jason who?""

Tony Gilroy had written not only the first three Bourne films but the great Michael Clayton as well but here, it is obvious that he is on a destructive ego trip. Gilroy is more interested in making people see on how smart he is as a scriptwriter and filmmaker than actually try to entertain and stay true to what made the other Bourne films special. With that destructive mind set, Gilroy forgets that you need faith in your actors and the material they are working with in order to drive the movie forward. Gilroy also commits the biggest sin of all, which is to never underestimate the intelligence of your audience.",2012
10,"I absolutely loved every minute of this movie, but let me start out by saying that I'm not a fan of any of the first three Bourne movies. I will also say that because this story is so different to the previous movies, it would have probably been better to give it a different title. There didn't need to be any reference to Bourne at all.",2012

8,"Thanks to the 2 heroes, I give a good mark though the script was a labyrinth of complications between different US National Security Services and their different projects more or less secret, some of them more secret within secrets because untellable, unacceptable. And when one of those has to disappear, lots of dead people it means. Here is the story of another run-for-his-life hero, Jeremy Renner! He surprised me this actor. He blows the screen from his very first appearance until the last. And Mrs Weisz, the co-runner-for-her-life does well too as an evolving character, a woman scientist who goes from naive close to stupid terrified victim to a full grown resilient survivor, doing very well with Mr Renner. Wow they are good! They SAVE the movie Let's hope there will be a sequel with these two but with a MUCH IMPROVED script, please. I declare myself a fan for Mr Renner (Please forgive my probably curious use of English, my second language...)",2012
3,"Jason Bourne is one of the more intriguing film characters of the past decade. He methodically and purposefully found out who he was, who was responsible for his condition, and attempted to bring everything back together again. Even better, he was not a superhero; Jason was just a guy who went through a lot of training. He is elite, but deep down he is still one of us. Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner), on the other hand, has been tweaked a little bit. He pops pills to up his physical and mental skills. Yes, he is still human too, but perhaps a bit genetically modified. This splash of sci/fi does not help an audience tuned in to the adventures of Jason Bourne connect with the new guy.",2012
10,"I was really skeptical going in, but having seen it, I have to say it was frigging AWESOME! Loved every second of it! SO worth the money! Finally something taking Bourne back in business! Bourne Ultimatum was just OK because of the constant stupid camera shaking that just made me mad so I did not enjoy that movie. The camera shaking was just too much. It made it very hard to follow the movie. This one tho was just smooth and cool! Well done Tony! Having said that I would have liked that Matt would have made at least a cameo Its sad and unprofessional for Matt do take a stance like that. ""I will only do Bourne with Paul"" What are you twelve?"". Matt you are the coolest guy on earth, but Tony made a better Bourne then Paul did with the last two.",2012
6,"Ouch. I wish Greengrass directed this film, because to me it felt like a mess. Had a good idea with a solid backing, but it failed to take advantage of it. I like that they intertwined the story within the Ultimatum storyline like you see in the preview as well as playing homage to the original series, but the execution sucked not to mention that the Bourne events had no influence on Cross' character - something that ""Legacy"" would suggest. The storytelling felt disjointed, and the action sequences had way too much camera shake to enjoy them (the first trilogy wasn't so bad). Other than Manila, and the solitude of Alaska, location is one trademark of the legacy that just wasn't there. In the first three films, the assassins didn't need to speak to have personality and character - this film's assassin was just a ghost in your memory.",2012
3,"Pointless entry into the Bourne series finds Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz taking over where Matt Damon left off in a sequel that lacks not only a real purpose to exist but lacks a script that can justify the movie as a continuation of the series. Tony Gilroy (who had a hand in screen writing the original three films) writes and directs this entry but forgets the showmanship and grace that Paul Greengrass and Doug Liman brought to the series, not to mention the solid storytelling that came with their efforts. Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz tried their best with the weak material Gilroy provides for them and they almost succeed, giving the audience something to care for but they are fighting an uphill battle against cliché one dimensional characters, dismal screen writing, a running time that needed to be edited down and amateurish direction that does no one any favors. The rest of the cast barely registers at all and the action is not even on the same level of the other films in the series.",2012

4,"In a way I think this film disgraces the Bourne series, and here's why: it simply did not have the feel of a Bourne movie. Between awkwardly chosen locations, some sci-fi drug twist, and and incredibly over-simplified and at times dull plot line, this is hardly an action movie, let alone a Bourne movie. Also, and this part really bothered me, I feel like Tony and Dan Gilroy did things with some of the Bourne characters that were not true to Robert Ludlum's vision, even going so far as to change the initiation program and the amount of information leaked at the end of Ultimatum. ",2012
6,"Great cast. Great acting. However, The entire film feels like the beginning to a movie. You keep telling yourself, 'wow, the intro was long now the movies really starting..oh nevermind'. ::Spoilers:: The entire goal of the protagonist is to acquire more of his regimented medicine. The goal of his enemies is to kill him. There is no trying to get back at the CIA, no typical Bourne stuff. The Bourne series was unnecessarily reused and they really should have just started off fresher. Scenes were drawn out, there were only about 2 clever plays made, and the main enemy never meets the prot. It's all very separated and remote. No connections are formed and we are not given the hope that he seeks to solve the issues at hand. They also completely write off Bourne.. wouldn't he know Pamela gets framed and that the overhead is still controlling black ops groups? A lot of things were not well thought out for this movie and it was entertaining but disappointing.",2012
4,"I could candy coat this and tell you I loved this film, but I won't because I didn't. I thought it was rather poorly written. However the saving grace was the actors themselves that pulled this out of the crapper in my opinion. Nothing new was added here except another layer to the Treadstone, Black Briar, and other Government absurdities from the other three movies. This sequel deals with genetics and DNA manipulation and since this is mentioned in the trailer, there is no spoiler alert needed. These genetic mutations were supposed to eliminate the inconsistencies that existed with Jason Borne (also in the trailer) and the operatives in his program. The way they dealt with how they supposedly ""fixed"" the inconsistencies is really what was made this an unbelievable script. However, the action and the acting of the two lead characters Rachel Weisz and Jeremy Renner make this movie tolerable. There was no reason to cast people like Stacey Keach or Edward Norton to this cast as they added no value other than their name to this film. Really, any no name actor could have provided the same quality to this film without having to pay for these actors. The plot wasn't too hard to follow, but be prepared for a few flashbacks to the other three movies, which to me, upsets the flow to the movie. The only reason I think they put them in in the first place was for people who may not have seen the other three Borne movies. Other than that, I don't think they're needed. ",2012

8,"While I had previously seen the Matt Damon-Bourne movies and remember enjoying them, I had watched them once when they came out and therefore can't remember specific details. So it was in seeing this new one with Jeremy Renner as the lead but as a different character from Damon's that I approached this one with a fresh perspective in following what was going on and why. So on that note, I enjoyed this one just as much as the others maybe even a little more since this one doesn't have the shaky-cam the others had. And I also liked Rachel Weisz as the doctor who escaped from her lab after an associate of hers was killing the other lab partners. And I loved seeing Renner and her together just running to survive whether through Maryland (which is where I'm currently vacationing right now) or the Philippines which is where my mom and late dad originally came from and my sisters had visited when they were little but I and my brother have yet to go to. It's possible I might have been a little more critical of this movie if I, like many reviewers on this site, had nearly perfect memory of those previous Bourne movies but as it is now, I highly enjoyed The Bourne Legacy.",2012

8,"I had dragged my feet on seeing this film due to lukewarm reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised. The Bourne Legacy is much better than the previous installment in the series, although die-hard fans might be disappointed over the absence of Matt Damon and the relegation of supporting characters played by David Strathairn and Joan Allen (and others) to mere cameo appearances. However, the principal performers in this film (Jeremy Renner, Rachel Weisz, and Edward Norton) infuse the franchise with a welcome rush of new energy and considerable on-screen charisma. The locations look great, and the action sequences are genuinely exciting and impressive. The film begins somewhat slowly, but this results in a degree of characterization that helps us invest in the well-being of the hero and heroine, and the pace definitely picks up in the second half. The open-ended nature of the conclusion seems designed as a brief pause before a sequel; while the lack of narrative closure will be frustrating for some viewers, I can hardly wait to see more of these characters from these filmmakers.",2012

It has so much potential and the lines are hilarious! Love the characters and James role is top notch, way better than Dawson. Not to mention Chloe and June, they are both amazing and their performances are incredibly well done. I need to see this back on air! Otherwise my day won't be complete without watching one of the episodes.",2013

I loved Krysten Ritter in Veronica Mars, Dreama Walker in Good Wife and James Van Der Beek in One Tree Hill and Dawson's creek. Also, I was pleasantly surprised by Liza Lapira who played Ivy in my beloved Dollhouse. But enough about actors. I really hope this show will be successful (don't see any reason why it shouldn't be), because there aren't enough snarky shows for women nowadays. Everything is too Disney-Glee sweet or too Jersey Shore vulgar. This is exactly between. And there are already legendary quotes going on. Don't miss out on this show. I laughed throughout the whole episode.",2012
10,"Every now and then a show comes along that just goes its own way -- fearless -- provocative -- dazzling! This is one of those rare treats and you have to hope that its audience finds it while this absolute miracle is still on the air. These people trust their maddest impulses and what you get is not only hilariously funny but also outrageously original and profoundly entertaining. Just when you think you know who these characters are they stun you with another of their many hidden ""facets"". Chloe (Krysten Ritter) is always in danger of running away with this one -- you just almost never see a performance this outrageously over-the-top that is also so beautifully nuanced ... but not so fast -- June (Dreama Walker) can turn it way, way up at any time and so can James Van Der Beek -- or possibly anyone in this all-pro cast -- who knows?",2012

9,"I gave this show a 9 in hopes of giving it a 10 some day. The show was funny, interesting and smart and James Van Der Beek goofing on himself was a great twist. This show has some good potential. I'm always skeptical about new sitcoms (too many bad ones have come along, too many good ones have been dumped) but I'm always willing to give a new one a shot. I'm not disappointed so far after just one episode. Krysten Ritter and Dreama(yeah, I know)Walker play well off each other and the supporting cast has a nice feel to them. No spoilers, no hints about what happens, just a simple thumbs up. The title and synopsis sum up what the show is about nicely.",2012

I'm a sucker for Krysten anyway, I have loads of her movies, although most of them weren't originally bought with her in mind, but she happened to be in CONFESSIONS OF A SHOPAHOLIC, SHE'S OUT OF MY LEAGUE... And I thought it odd that such a striking girl was always second-string. So I jumped at the chance for the complete box-set of DON'T TRUST THE B---- IN APARTMENT 23. I had the notion that it would be popular with me. That it might be very cute. I had high hopes for it. Wow, what I didn't expect was that it would skyrocket to the highest echelons of my own hit parade.

Chloe and Junes character run beautifully together, even though I wasn't a regular Dawsons Ck watcher, I love the idea of having real characters. Chloes character stands out and I love Krystens moves and the way she acts, so much energy, I love it. I really hope this show goes for a long time. Congratulations.",2012

It's unfortunate that they cancelled the show, it's probably because it didn't appeal to a wider demographic range.

So much talent can be had from this cast as most of us have seen over the years. If the dialogue from this movie wasn't enough to deter me from liking it then it was the multiple references to previous action films starring the individual cast that did it. The addition of Liam Hemsworth playing billy the kid was a strong move considering his part was by far the most interesting and well portrayed. Better kill off the greatest part in the film (it was pretty evident and cliché that Billy was going to die due to the fact that in every film where someone is about to leave or better themselves in some way leads to their death). Another thing that really bothered me about this film was the fact that Jason Statham's ""honey"" bothering him throughout the film had literally no relevance, yet they led the audience to believe it would.",2012

I saw this in an IMAX, but that didn't make the movie less painful. The story is the same old one, good partner gets killed the teams takes revenge. The first 15 minutes was bearable. There was nothing but mindless killing. Every scene is unrealistic and there is absolutely no story line. The good guys can apparently stand and shoot 1000 people face on face and bad guys will miss them. 5 guys shooting and killing 100 people in a open room without getting hit, is what best describes the movie. And finally stallone defeats the villain in fist fight. Oh he had a gun but u know fist fights are better. This is worse than any bad Indian movie i have ever seen. Most Indian superhero movies are much better than this movie. ",2012
1,"The first thing that strikes me about this movie is, why does it look SO bad? Is it the feel or style they are going for? I dunno, it just looks bad. Maybe they are trying to Vaseline screen the aging stars, who are all in great shape by the way, or are they saving on film? Do they even use film anymore? SPOILER ALERT Virtually every action scene here is over the top and totally unbelievable except for a short scene with Jet Li. The initial escape scene makes NO SENSE! Sly gets shot while going down a seemingly infinite zip line? Statham's got his back so he stays behind while they are surround and the rest of the team continues the escape on the water high speed style. Out of nowhere Sly and Jason are rescued by fledgling team member snipers them out of the situation. Sly grunts ""Time for plan b"" back to the water chase. Jet skis, for no apparent reason appear from nowhere and the team abandons the boat. Just when all is lost, Stallone and Statham zoom overhead in the plane they arrived in. How is this plan b? Wouldn't the boats and jet ski's be plan b. Jet skis shoot into the ramp of the plane as the plane struggles get get enough lift to take off before they crash into a huge damn. Hey, since we are having trouble gaining altitude, let's head for the HIGHEST POINT on the dam! Most of the action scenes pretty much follow this level of nonsense. Oh well, maybe the writing is good? Nope! Back story for the newbie team member to make us care about him when he gets killed pretty much goes like this, ""So, how did you get into this line of work?"" "" I was in Afganistan for three years when my platoon got trapped in the oil zone. By the time we got out, four of my friends were dead. When I got back to base, they had shot the dog I was taking care of, so, I'd had enough killing for the day""! That's it? That's the best the writes of this mega budget could come up with? Also to the character, since you had enough killing you decided to become a mercenary where you would kill people all day!

You're blasted off in the first few minutes leading up to the actual story. Obviously, this is not a film with a great script or impressive acting.However, the story works well for what it's supposed to do! It is greatly entertaining if you are looking for an action packed movie loaded with iconic action stars like Stallone,Willis and many more. The addition of Chuck Norris and van Damme to the cast worked out well. It's really good to see Chuck Norris in action again and he really pulls it off! I expect that the people who will like this movie most will be the fans of the old guard like Stallone, Schwwarzennegger and Norris and the other cast members. Someone I really liked was Liam Hemsworth who did a great job and stood his own between these action giants! Nan Yu as Maggie was also a good casting choice an did what she was supposed to do.",2012

One has to be a fan of the action genre of the 1980s and early 1990s, as well as enjoying those action heroes' persona and screen presence whenever they appear on-screen. They did not necessarily have to act well, but they had to be tough, heroic, stoic, larger than life. Realism need not really apply here - it's all about the fun factor.

2,"This movie fails in almost everything that is there to fail. Nothing that can thought as original as everything is big mash up served to upset people. When there are too many heroes it does not mean there cannot be any co-ordinated team work. They wasted lot of film just to give entry. The story is very predictable and pretty much compromised for some petty bloody action sequences. People who might have given such high ratings would have fallen victim for the cheesy dialogs and the reminiscence of the old movie dialogs.Compared to the first movie this movie villains are duds and heroes are more or less bloody comedians.In one word this movie can never be called as action movie. It is like a parody.I only wish if they have modified the story with some original dialogs with interesting plot and a notorious evil genius as villain who treats everyone as expendables to reach his vision to be stopped by this rag bag team of mercenaries. But this was just bang,boom,slash where only heroes weapons are activated and villains are merely target practice. Even if you want to salute these old heroic actors don't waste your money on this one it will simply make them worthless. However all the above is only my opinion.",2012
7,"I must admit, the hype for the first film was too much and in the end, we all got some intense 80s style action but with a poor story. This sequel however actually has a story, a story of revenge. The first film introduces the gang so we get to know them. The second however, we already know the gang so now we actually see how they truly are and how they work. This film is better since the rest of the team (other than Stallone) get more screen time and they have their humor moments. Van Dammne played a very very very very very AWESOME villain, and towards the end of the film, he shows even at the age of 50, he is stronger than ever. Arnie and Bruce Willis had a great screen time too with perfect humor, seriously the chemistry between those 2 and the rest is great. Speaking of chemistry, Dolph Lundgren's role is MUCH better now and very enjoyable. Chuck Norris, you'd be surprise how he is. The cast was great, the story is better, the action is MORE intense, there is great humor. In conclusion, Expendables 2 brings back the 1980s action style with it's teaspoon of humor. Enjoy the film!",2012

And if the response from the box office is stellar, I suppose The Expendables can build upon a formula that's established through the two films to date, that somehow follows how James Bond would have done it, with its longevity inspiring similar treatment.

And speaking of Arnold, it was great to see him back and part of the action this time. Probably one of the reasons I enjoyed this one a bit more than the second film.",2012
8,"Now I enjoyed the original Expendables for what it was but I was felt disappointed in the outcome because of the way it was hyped up and I felt a lot of things could have made it better, and that things were missing. Now years later, watching the Expendables 2 and not having as such high expectations I went into the film excited and thrilled for surprises. I also did not read any reviews or check critics ratings upon watching. I found this to be greater than the original for many reasons. The plot was more focused, the characters were more detailed (we got to like them more), and mainly because of the more well directed intense action scenes.",2013
9,"This sequel did not disappoint! Maximum star power, maximum firepower, maximum excitement. ""The Expendables 2"" was a thrill ride that no one will ever forget. Sly is back with his crew once more, but this time they gain a new recruit: Bill the Kid (Liam Hemsworth) who's a top notched sniper, and Maggie (Yu Nan) who is smart but very gutsy in nature. They bring back all the ones who just had cameos in the first installment. It got more fun when they got Booker(Chuck Norris) "" The Lone Wolf"", and Jean-Claude Van Damme. There's one drawback, he's a villain. The action in the movie was totally non-stop, there was also a lot of humor, clichés, and one liners in the film. So long to list, I can't catch up if I tried. ""I''ll be back!"", is a classic. Sly and Van Damme? An unlikely battle in the making, however, it's a new epic battle anyone can think of. Dolph Lundgren was known for his intellectual talent back in the 80's. He really put it into good use here. If you thought the first movie was something, you haven't seen anything like this. ""The Expendables 2"" is a must see movie for years to come. All star action, all star humor, and just enough adrenaline to keep you alert at all times. Enjoy this movie! 4.5 out of 5 stars.",2012
1,"This movie was really awful, I mean it's a non-stop non-sensical over- the-top macho movie with a lot of silly and wasted jokes, forced storyline (if there's any) and lots of cameos and stupid one-liners and references to other movies these actors have made.",2012

Although it does have its flaws, it has paved an entirely new route in the worn-out genre of superheroes. Chronicle brings all the major superhero questions into play—Where did our powers come from? How should we use our powers? In the end, however, those questions are irrelevant. This movie is not about three superheroes. It is about three teenage boys who just happen to have super powers.",2012
8,"Chronicle is a ""found footage"" film that is similar to Cloverfield, The Blair Witch Project, and - the infamous - Paranormal Activity series.

9,"The next in a long line of ""found footage"" flicks that have been flooding our cinemas over the last few years, Chronicle breaks free of the usual constraints within that sub genre to concoct a truly memorable sci-fi thriller. Retracing the steps of three teenage friends who are gifted with telekinesis after a chance encounter with something (intelligently, the movie never stipulates what exactly), the story focuses on the varying paths they take with their new found talent, but not until they have had some juvenile fun with it first. This is an amazingly accomplished debut feature for writer-director Josh Trank (who co-penned the script with Max ""son of John"" Landis); his technical veracity is utterly mind-blowing – especially when you consider the shoestring funds he had to work with – and his narrative pacing is impeccable. The icing on the already yummy cake is the marvellous CGI that allows our protagonists to fly, crush cars and stop baseballs in mid air – all seamlessly and photo-realistically. Chronicle is a tremendous achievement in low-budget, big-concept filmmaking.",2012
8,"Chronicle is one of those films that kind of snuck up on everyone and may very well have slid under the radar if not for a somewhat dead weekend in February and good word of mouth.

7,"Ever since the breakout success of 1999's The Blair Witch Project, the found footage film has become a subgenre in its own right. In a similar vein to Blair Witch, the Paranormal Activity series has found great financial success with their comparatively meagre budgets, and Cloverfield in 2008 proved that, even on a larger scale, the handycam aesthetic can deliver effective thrills when employed by filmmakers who have a solid understanding of the style. Josh Trank's Chronicle represents an evolution of the found footage genre, taking the character as cameraman conceit to interesting new places, and marking the director as a young talent worth monitoring.",2012

Never would you have imagined a super hero origins movie being shot with a hand-held camera. They are often related to high octane action sequences and graphics and CGI. Well that thing doesn't change here either but the treatment is creative and thoroughly engaging. If suppose paranormal activity and any super hero movie were to mate, their offspring would have been called ""Chronicle"".",2012
8,"Chronicle is not really a superhero movie. It uses its themes but none of the characters are using their powers for virtues and justice. It's all fun and games until they get into trouble. It's a great idea but it could have been filmed in a regular filmmaking style. The hand-held camera fails to make the film credible. Despite from that, the film tells a great story with a great twist. The actors are fun. The CGI is good enough. The film is short and small but it's undeniably exciting and really compelling than any other big blockbuster films we usually get.",2012

I went to a couple of dreadful movies such as "" open water "" and "" Jumper "" but this movie was the best of beating them in all kinds of awfulness .. and for that a friend of mine just couldn't stand watching it and just went out the theater going for "" Sherlock Holmes 2 "" which was running in the theater beside us although it was his SECOND TIME watching it !!",2012
1,Wasn't expecting much but was dragged by high IMDb review score... was so wrong here- film is so boring that I started to fast forward in the middle of it (for 3 minutes as my girlfriend told me to stop as she watched most of it and it's not much of torment left). Film is done in a Blair Witch Project way- main characters are filming everything and it's the same way of personal camera story tell way. As all we know it tells the story of American teenagers and such teenagers are the only positive audience this film can have. Actually I am really surprised it can have any positive audience as I really tried hard to understand what could be graded so high... Film doesn't show anything- action just goes flat forward relentless- guys are talking about everything but nothing they say is really interesting. It tries to show feelings guys share between each other- their relationship and emotion-play. The thing is that story is sooo poorly made and scenario is sooo weak that all the behaviour of the guys (specially Andrew with his psycho problems) is tiresome and is annoying for the spectator. The only positive thing is special effects- they are nice but you could good as well watch them separately- you would save a lot of time... So I will- as this movie- tell no more- there is nothing more to say...,2012
1,"Found footage is now a business model exclusively and this horrible thing makes it extremely obvious. Whole plot devices are crafted merely as an alibi for cameras being around in the most implausible situations to accidentally set up a perfect OTS shot. Being limited in telling a story, when everything needs to fit into a situation with some kind of camera around, the directors elegant solution of course is to convert 85% of the unimaginative dialog into exposition, spoon-feeding you the two dimensional, infantile melodrama, leaving 10% to explain the camera presence in some way and adding 5% of irritating bull crap that I guess the writers thought modern teenagers would say when behaving naturally. They wouldn't. For action there is no time.",2012
1,"From the outset, I will say that I liked the Blair Witch Project - it was unique in it's use of a hand-held camera to film most of the work. I thought that Cloverfield was good, although it was a bit of a rehash in the style of Blair Witch Project. This movie just seemed to have no idea on how to get the best of the hand-held camera.",2012
9,"Wow..just.. this movie left me speechless. It was amazing And to think me and my friends were going to see The Grey. I'm so glad the cinema was full and we watched this instead. I can honestly say I haven't been this entertained and adrenaline rushed since I watched Kick-ass all the way in 2010. This movie is a epic, but not a Lord of the Rings epic, a different kind of epicness. Although this movie is not original in the slightest it is a breath of fresh air, and P.O.V hand-held camera is very well done. ",2012

I will also say beforehand that I appreciate low-budget and independent film. It was because of these reviews that I did not leave the theater; I kept believing that SOMETHING was going to happen. Something finally did happen, the kid lost it...and an unbelievable series of dumb action events ensued. The boys could have found much better ways to capitalize on their powers so that Andrew could have some money to save his dying mother. Instead he just uses it to beat up some old park bullies with 40's, punch a clerk, and open a cash register containing $300, maybe. The father should have just killed the kid in a drunken rage in the first scene and I would have enjoyed it more.",2012

And the part at the end where his friend makes the spear go through him, give me a break the police had every opportunity to shoot him. The so-called special effects were weak and looked stupid. I can't believe the good reviews this movie is getting. I don't get it, it was stupid and weak and I couldn't wait for it to be over so I could go home! Lol. I agree with all the other bad reviews! I should have went to see the movie with the Rock, it couldn't have been worse! Wow OK I can't post until I write ten lines on how awful this movie was!",2012

10,"I don't see how any body can give this movie anything below an 8 for the simple fact the special effects were awesome! The script was realistic and I'm tired of seeing the haters bashing the movie and calling it cheap. It's one of the best movies of the year hands down. People are complaining about the nose bleeds significance. They said their power is like a muscle you can break it if you stretch it too far past the limit you've strengthened it. The black guy moved the car early in the movie and he bled profusely as punishment comparing his face to a period. Andrew became strong as hell because throughout the movie he was working the muscle just by having the camera above his head 24-7 even when he slept. So, think about the movie before you give it a 5 because the script of a teenager. Andrew recorded it it's supposed to be like that.",2012
1,"This is the worst film I have seen in ages. The premise looked promising but the film they made was just so unbelievably bad. If you think you'd like nearly 2 hours of extra-shaky hand-cam footage, spectacularly annoying idiots yelling at each other, and repetitive special effects with lots of stuff breaking, then this is the film for you. The three main characters are dumb beyond belief and it's impossible to sympathize with any of them. There is no explanation as to how the super powers came about and the characters don't spend one moment thinking about how they could change their lives or anyone else's lives for the better. They just do a bunch of dumb things and then they do a bunch of even dumber things. Do yourself a favour and watch anything else. I cannot believe how high the ratings are for this piece of garbage!",2014

7,"This Audiard film is one that grows on you. For quite some time into the film it seems both the film and its main characters aimlessly sit in their cocoon without breaking out. One feels some very vague potential in people but somehow their very lives seem the greatest impediments to its blossoming. One wonders what the film is about and where it is going. Like its characters, it feels like a bunch of loose ends aimlessly hanging about. But I must say that at the end of the movie it has grown on you: suddenly, as the story progresses, the film hatches, the characters break out of their cocoon and in retrospect one feels one has been witness to the improbable -and yet realistic- birth of an unusual but deep love story between two common people. The story has a hidden intensity of screenplay which is intensely performed by Schoenaerts and Cotillard. It creeps beneath your skin. If you like Audiard's way of developing gradual character drama with an intensity that seems to be implicit, buried beneath trailer-trash but still strongly present, you'll like this film. It's a story of how one can find anew a purpose in life when one feels like wasted trash. I watched this film in a full theatre of some 300 people. At the end most everybody sat silent for some minutes. It seems the film had touched something inside quite some of us there. Film as it should be.",2012
8,"There's a moment towards the end of Rust And Bone when something awful happens, and we are about to witness the ultimate tragedy. For that couple of minutes, the rest of the movie becomes irrelevant; we are just totally immersed in this act playing out. It's a brutal but wonderful sequence and, fortunately, it's not the first time we have such a scene in the movie. That's pretty much what Rust And Bone is: a series of wonderfully brutal sequences.",2012
9,"Co-written by Audiard and Thomas Bidegain, and adapted from a collection of short stories by the American author Craig Davidson, Jacques Audiard's genuinely moving Rust and Bone is the story of two wounded people who form a bond based on recognition and acceptance of the others pain. Supported a lovely score by Alexandre Desplat, the film is marked by astonishing performances by Oscar winner Marion Cotillard as Stephanie, a young whale trainer struggling to recover from a horrendous accident, and Matthias Schoenaerts as Ali, a brutish ex-boxer who is unable to acknowledge or express his feelings.",2012
10,"What a remarkable performance! Marion Cotillard as an actress, as an artist goes as far here as very few actresses have gone before - Total and utter truth no matter how wrenching - Maria Falconetti in The Passion Of Joan Of Arc, Meryl Streep in Sophie's Choice, Anna Magnani in Bellissima and very few others, now, for me, Marion Cotillard in Rust And Bone belongs right up there among the sublime. Here I should be commenting on the film and my comment is all about her because Rust And Bone is her, Marion Cotillard. Her co-star, totally new to me, Matthias Schoenaerts, is superb as the handsome, unwitting agent provocateur. Not to be missed.",2017
9,¨What have you done with my legs? ¨,2013
9,"I watched this film at the Canes Film Festival, audience expectation was high the huge Palais auditorium completely filled. Jacques Audiard is my favourite director, as with Tahir Rahim in A Prophet and Roman Duris in The Beat that my heart skipped, Audiard managed to get an astounding performance from his male lead Schoenaerts, performed as a brutal man lacking the capability to show warmth or love to his young son and the women that cross his path, his performance as a bouncer come fist fighter for money is always believable though completely unsympathetic. You wish him to succeed though you find it hard to like him so often does his character disappoint, seemingly incapable of love and sensitivity, his straight forward requests for sex come out as comic rather than charming, but his open down-to-earth approach and honesty, often gets him what he desires. Meeting Cotillard he is met and challenged by a very strong woman, damaged she needs to find herself again, he could possibly help, at least initially physically rather than emotionally. As their characters interact throughout the film I was unsure as too who would change who, fascinating highly watchable characters struggle to prevail against bad luck and to pull themselves out of the mire of despair and poverty, my kind of film. Again a remarkable film by a master film maker, completely at ease with breaking the conventions of traditional romance.",2012
10,"I tremendously enjoyed this movie. Some people think this is a story about a girl who loses her legs. It's not. The story isn't about her. The real main character in this story perhaps is Ali, played by Matthias Schoenaerts. Well maybe it's not about him as well. What this story is definitely about is fighting. This story is not meant to be touching, it is all about coping strategies. With Ali it's really fight or flee, for Marie it's getting back on your feet after a devastating blow. ",2012
8,"Rust and Bone is new film by Jacques Audiard known largely for his  breakout success A Prophet and concerns the burgeoning relationship  between whale trainer Stephanie (Marion Cotillard) and street fighter  Ali (Matthias Schoenaerts).  If you can avoid it, it's probably best to avoid much of the plot, but  given it's been fairly publicised this is fairly difficult, but this is  a film that deals with disability, image and to some extent, class.  It's been mentioned a lot, but what's really wonderful about this film  is it's complete sidestepping of exaggerated sentimentality it could so  easily fall prey to.  In the wrong hands, this could be a feel-good, motivational tale of a  disabled person overcoming their hardships and finding love and  personal confidence with a emotionally crippled partner who learns to  overcome his own shortcomings in a fantastical fairy-tale rather like  another rather successful French film that was released earlier this  year.  In all honesty too, what I just described isn't completely far-off the  narrative arc in Rust and Bone.  The way the film handles its characters' emotionally however is so much  more satisfying due, partly to the brilliant performances by both  Cotillard and Schoenaert, but also in Audiard's writing and direction.  After all, Rust and Bone is a feel-good tale eventually, but it takes a  really long time to get there and doesn't revel in it.  The two leads do overcome their physical and emotional traumas through  their relationship but it is a slow process of recovery, one that is  instantly recognisable in every day life.  For a film with such a potentially over-the-top synopsis, it does  incredibly well to stay focused on this small set of characters it  presents us as believable and relate-able figures.  It poses some fascinating questions; is street fighting really any more  or less cruel than training beautiful orcas to perform tricks for our  pleasure? Why do this father and son move in the first place? We only  have to assume that whatever was going on before the narrative was  worse than what is happening on screen.  What was Stephanie like before her accident? And, like in Beasts of the  Southern Wild, is being tough with your child sometimes necessary?  These questions leave the film open, even though the main narrative is  fairly straightforward.  All in all, the sheer range of emotions this film produces is testament  to it's strength.  It is difficult and charming, brutal and beautiful, melancholic and  humorous throughout, exactly when and where it needs to be.  My only real criticism is that the narrative dips a tiny bit in the  third act, once the central relationship is finally consummated (which  again, takes along time and initially is very matter-of-fact in a  suitably amusing scene), the narrative begins to drag its heels a tiny  bit, as the film seems to completely forget about Ali's son (though his  character seems to for a bit as well) but the final coda remains to  avoid sentimentality in an excellent closing few scenes.  The cinematography and soundtrack are pretty beautiful too, completing  a fantastic triumph of an understated film.",2012
10,"Marion Cotillard in ""Rust And Bone"" gave my favorite performance in a long, long time. She is astonishing. Her performance here touched a personal cord with me and reminded me of actresses who've been able to transform me. Yes, that's exactly what she's done, transform me. She was able to awaken my sense of compassion and admiration. Simone Signnoret in ""Room At The Top"", Annie Girardot in ""Rocco And His Brothers"" Samantha Eggar in ""The Collector"", Charlotte Rampling in ""The Night Porter"" Those performances by those actresses not only instructed me as a man but inspired me. Now Marion Cotillard has done it again for me and I'm very grateful. As a bizarre note, she has been ignored by the Oscars, how is that possible?",2013

The performances are incredibly powerful and real. Marion Cotillard is able to speak without saying a word and that something extremely rare! She is so expressive you can feel her pain. I think it really touched me because the movie is really real, this story seems to be able to happened to anybody and that's Audiard force. His writing skills are just amazing. Marion should get an Oscar for a performance of this magnitude.I believe she will soon become Hollywood favorite.

Now, flash forward nearly 20 years (Gosh, how time flies) and we have Marion Cotillard getting her legs bitten off by a killer whale, and the technology is even more amazing. There isn't a single scene where we're not 100% convinced she's lost her limbs, and the stakes are raised even higher when she's fitted with artificial ones. How they managed to insert this footage so completely into the movie is anyone's guess. I kind of don't want to know, as this would spoil the illusion.",2014

Of course it also had a good budget to play with (for European standards that is). If they do an US remake, you can bet they'll cut off some of the edges (and some of the erotic/nude content too).",2013
8,"Rarely does a film use its source material (in this case, two powerfully devastating short stories by Craig Davidson) and transform it into something new and equally formidable. That, however, is precisely what Jacques Audiard has done with ""Rust and Bone,"" a moving and raw look at how two rather ordinary people respond to extraordinary circumstances. Stephanie, a whale trainer played by the brilliant Marion Cotillard, must face life as a double amputee after a freak accident. Alain—played by the painfully handsome Matthias Schoenaerts—is a single father who must juggle his need to support his son while eking out a living for himself as a security guard. Stephanie's and Alain's lives intersect in unexpected but perfectly plausible ways, and their story generates equal parts despair and inspiration. This is an emotionally difficult but ultimately life- affirming film. And I sincerely hope that it helps catapult Schoenaerts to fame in the US. He embodies an atypical combination of ruggedness and heartfelt emotion rarely seen on film.",2013
6,"Jacques Audiard's films are always so frustrating for me. They are always marred by the violent male protagonists and his love of violence. The lead character loves his son, yes, but he's a horrible father and should not have custody of him. I kept wishing he would be arrested for his various crimes and put in jail. The extreme fighting scenes were unnecessary - he could have the same basic problems without the extreme violence.",2013

4,"I had a conversation recently with a friend who stated ""The French only make good films."" His reasoning behind this statement was that all the French films he's seen on general release here have impressed him. The same may be said for German films. And Iranian. And Korean. And The reason being that, generally speaking, films that perform poorly domestically aren't worth promoting on the foreign markets. Hence he judges the French film industry on Jean de Flourette, Belleville Rende-vous, La Haine etc. (just don't tell him about Les Visiteurs or the god-awful Asterix films!). Rust and Bone will serve to perpetuate the myth of his own making, though it is certainly not the 'great' that some have implied.",2012

Training Day, The Fast and the Furious, Dark Blue and S.W.A.T. all showcase his passion for writing screenplays about these streets and the role that police officers play in them. His two films as director (Harsh Times and Street Kings) showed that he could also direct hard hitting dramas depicting the underbelly of the L.A. and the police force. End Of Watch marks Ayer's second film as both writer and director.",2012

There are a couple notable television series', like ""Hill Street Blues"" and the now dated but oddly fascinating reality series ""Cops"", but on film, these guys don't get a lot of luck. I guess everyone would rather see movies about undercover officers or detectives. Well for anyone like me who's been waiting for it, here it is. End Of Watch, an excellent take on the genre. It may not be perfect, but it's unique and shows the day to day life more effectively than most if any cop movies I've seen, and as such I think it will one day be essential viewing for fans of the genre.",2012

The way the script was written allowed David Ayer to elicit an incredible range of emotion from the viewers. It's hilariously funny during car scenes between Jake and Michael, playing on relatable awkward topics of sex, dating, and other things best friends would joke about, yet incredibly serious, showing just how intense and dangerous police officers' jobs in South Central LA can be. The use of Jake's hand-held camera gives a Paranormal Activity feeling (without the headache) that adds to the ""realness"" of the film. I highly recommend this film and challenge anyone to not be completely moved by the end of it.",2012

While ""End of Watch"" is often funny, the newest film from ""Training Day"" writer David Ayer, is no comedy.",2013
9,"This is hands down the best cop movie i have ever seen, nothing depicted here is new, gangs, money, drugs, torture, cops, death, etc...it is the way that its depicted that makes it stand out, the last time that these issues were well shown was in SHIELD. Jake gives his best performance yet, he really does stand out all the way till the end him and his partner play amazing cops. You really feel the intensity and reality of thee life of a cop shown through Jake's recordings, its just amazing how it all feels so real...you will not regret watching this film if you can handle it that is... This movie will keep you glued to the seat till the very end. End of watch was a great watch.",2012
8,"This was a real unique journey in drama. A mix of studio camera and innovative character cameras interwoven with the story. Casting brought two very strong actors together and their chemistry was right on target. The plot was simple but the ingredient that put this film over the top was realism and believability. Yes it is very raw and if I got a dollar for every ""F-bomb"" I could by a home in Malibu for sure. Realism is the main course and this film would not lose it's true identity. I found what really put this movie in the must see category is that ...One minute your laughing and the next you're crying. There are very few films that can achieve this element with this level of quality. This is, without a doubt, one of the very best films of the year.",2012
7,"The efficient LAPD Police Officers Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Mike Zavala (Michael Peña) are partners and best friends. Mike is married with Gabby (Natalie Martinez), who is pregnant, and Brian is having a serious love affair with Janet (Anna Kendrick). Brian has the intention of making a movie and is using a handy cam to film his daily work with his partner, under the protest of his colleague Van Hauser (David Harbour). After killing a powerful gangster in self-defense, they are transferred by Sarge (Frank Grillo) to South Central Los Angeles where there is a war between black and Mexican gangs. When Mike and Brian arrest a gangster and find a great load of drugs and people involved in human-trafficking, they are sentenced to death by the Cartel and hunted down by a Mexican gang. What will happen to them?",2016
9,"The script is so well written, it almost hurts. Almost because it is really just good! And I loved the fact, that it got recognized in America too (at the Box office, it did open at Number 1). While I won't go into the story, the casting of Jake and his partner couldn't have been better. It feels like the guys know each other their whole life. Their interactions with social media and ""real"" life feel ... well real. Nothing in this movie feels like it is staged for entertainment purposes nor does the dialogue sound fake.",2013
8,"Unlike many of the current crop of macho cop dramas, End of Watch plays mainly to the grit of the daily challenges of patrolling the mean streets of South Central LA in the ""Shootin' Newton"" division. Unlike the stunning LA Confidential, with a historical story line, End of Watch is done in the cinema ver'ite' style - in a realistic real cops on duty in the LA war zone frame. The casting in this movie is picture perfect, with each actor giving in depth performances.The story line brings the Mexican / US drug problem into crystal clarity. Initially, the story fails to coalesce, and the video cam work is a bit disjointed and over done at the outset, but once you settle in to cinematic method, the film gets a hold on you. Definitely a movie for any law enforcement aficionados collection.",2012
4,"I had high expectations for this movie, and was severely let down. The letdown came from a number of small things rather than one big one. While I accepted the story line of tough inner city cops working tough neighborhoods, I found the use of hand-held cameras to show uncommon angles to be an unnecessary distraction. So was the constant referencing of Anna Kendrick's cleavage in almost every shot she was in.",2013
8,"End of Watch seems to be another film that uses the found-footage style, but once again it's not a successful try. However, it still gets what it wants by being a true to life buddy cop film with a ridiculous amount of intensity. End of Watch looks pretty simple as a crime thriller, but everything is actually brilliant. The crimes are grim and the action is a load of thrills. But what really makes this film so appealing is the chemistry between Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Peña. Their bromantic moments keeps the entire film so charming. The rest of End of Watch is engaging and interestingly gripping.",2012

8,"End of Watch is a cop drama dealing with more of the perspective side of cops and view their daily routine as to what they do. Starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Peña. While you've got your disbelief suspended, you'll want to also note of the film's found footage gimmick and shaky cam, which asks us to buy that snappily-edited multi-camera scenes are. It's hard to see why director David Ayer – who wrote the similarly lurid but far superior Training Day – bothered with this presentational quirk, since it has no bearing on the plot and is pursued too half-heartedly to be remotely convincing. Presumably it's just designed to fire the adrenal glands of kids hopped up on the phoney spontaneity of scripted reality shows and army recruitment videos.",2013
4,*SPOILERS**SPOILERS**SPOILERS*,2013
1,"This movie was one of the most mangled pieces of garbage I think I have  ever seen. I actually almost wish that I was speaking in hyperbole. I  was so insanely bored by ""found footage"" of some loser cop's college  class project that I would rather have watched a documentary on the  history of drinking straws. The movie is basically about two cops that  do nothing but goof around, break protocol, and act like the low-lifes  that they are trying to uproot. Not only is half of the movie  unrealistic, such as ignoring a government agent's orders to leave the  gang that they are dealing with alone, buts it is saturated with  stereotypes that are hyperbolas themselves. The ""gangsters"" in this  film talk like they are actors in a porno. Almost every line of  dialogue that they utter is laced with f-bombs. Don't get me wrong  cussing happens a lot in many people's lives and occupations, but to  the point where literally every other word is f**k is annoying. There  is a particular seen where some of the gang-bangers are talking about  killing the cops and it sounds somewhat like this, ""Dude, F, we are  f-ing gonna f these f-ers up f-ing forever f-ing even f-ing if we have  to f-ing f those f-ers 'til they're f-ed so much that f-ing their f-ing  mom will be f-ing skull f-ing them to f-ing bring their f-ing f's back  to f-ing life. F bro. I'm f-ing serious. F. F. F I F-ing love you."" And  this kind of dialogue happens at least three times for what seems like  10 minutes each scene. The fact that the gangsters are filming  themselves is one of the dumbest things because most of the recordings  are of them talking about committing crimes and killing the cops. I'd  love to see the court case after the fact where 300 hours of  incriminating footage had been recovered as evidence to put these  idiots down. That might almost make a better movie than this one. Then  there is the other stuff that all the other bad reviews have mentioned.  The acting is terrible. And no I do not believe that Gyllenhal and Pena  saved this movie. It is the worst film that either of them has been in.  Also many of the reviewers are right; these cops would have died  horrible deaths with as many bullets that were supposedly being shot at  them. The fact that cops would be portrayed like this, even though I  hate cops, it is disrespectful to all who serve for the police forces  in America. I can't even think of any redeeming qualities for this  film. If I could I would give it a zero. The only part of the film  where I may have smiled in joy is when one of these loser cops kicks  the bucket but then they ruin the movie again by letting his partner  live and sob into his chest. I'm actually surprised he didn't kiss him  goodbye. My movie theatre has a ""no refund policy"" and therefore I sat  and kept praying the movie would somehow get better or at least just  end. It is really sad that stuff like this can get released in  theatres, get good reviews, and steal my money all in one day. I've  practically stopped seeing movies for the first two weeks because  that's how long you usually have to wait for the honest reviews to  emerge.",2013
8,"Gritty, real and lots of action. The director/writer, Ayer, grew up on the streets of El Lay and it shows. Jake Gyllenhal and Michael Pena are just electric as partners in a black and white, and the performance by Cle Shaheed Sloan as the street hood with a sense of honor named Tre is awesome. The dialog is so good, that half the time you think this is an episode of Cops without any bleeps.",2012
3,"End of Watch was OK. Entertaining enough but I would say just wait for DVD/blu ray. It's supposed to be one of those Blair witch or cloverfield type movies where as the viewer you are supposed to be watching ""found footage."" In the beginning, the movie establishes that Jake Gyllenhaull has a hand-held camcorder while also having, along with his partner, a minicam pinned to their uniforms. My main gripe, however, is that there are camera shots interspersed throughout the film that are not from any camera point of view. This breaks the rule of ""found footage"" movies. For instance, Jake is recording his partner kick open a locked door from the front of an empty house. All of a sudden though we cut to a shot from inside the house just to see his partner bust open the door and them coming through with guns drawn. Yet, no one is in the house so who's camera are we looking through? Then we are suddenly back looking through Jake's camcorder. It just didn't make sense and it happens a little too often. It's like the director wanted to include certain shots but couldn't think of how to include them so he just threw them in there and just hoped no one noticed. #SloppyDirecting",2012
1,"Yes, This whole movie was filmed in a Blair Witch Fashion. You know what I'm talking about. The Shaky Cam, you see what we see poop Hollywood has been dumping on us for years. I do admit I'm not a fan of this style but I always try to give a movie a fair chance especial with a awesome cast like this. Sadly I regret giving this movie a chance. It was just awful. The story line was insanely predictable. From the very beginning I had this feeling like I've already seen this movie before. The main Actors Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Peña did a really good job with what they had to work with but the rest of the cast dropped the ball so hard that there was no way the main actors could carry them. Just listen to the bad guys dialog. Every other word is an F-bomb. They were trying so hard to look bad ass (especially the female actor) but it was in no way convincing. In fact it was very much laughable. If you don't mind bad acting, shaky cams and horrible story-lines then give this movie ago. If you hate wasting your time watching crap gift wrapped in good reviews (I really don't understand how.) then this movie is for you.",2012
1,"I signed up for an IMDb account just so I could review this movie. I've never seen a David Ayers flick before. This was essentially a snuff flick. The higher plot (if there was one) was that life sucks and the bad guys win. There was no elevation of the spirit...no higher meaning of the story. You spend the movie getting to know the characters and they simply kill one. The dealers and cartels win, no side-plots discussed, nothing...it just ends. They apologetically revisit an earlier 4 minute buddy flick contextual discussion as an afterthought...kind of a tart apology for such foul fare.",2012
8,"Oh yes, this is a chick-flick. One that is a proper showcase to prove Zac Efron has grown up to be a heck of a hunk! Also, you can never, ever find anything to fault with any performance turned in by Blythe Danner. She has been perfect in any role I've ever seen her in, this one is no exception. I have to say that logic does step in and you want, desperately, to say, ""Oh for goodness sake, just do what you came to do!"" But if that should have happened, it would have ended up a short movie, indeed. There is enough action, romance, gentle humor, wonderful Louisiana scenery, good people, bad people, decent story-line, fine acting.it's a pretty good movie. Nothing earth-shattering or Oscar-worthy happens here, perhaps, but it's a film I'd recommend and one I enjoyed watching.",2012
6,"There seems to be a consistent trend in the movies based on Nicholas Sparks' romance novels. They all contain sappy clichés and a lack of substance. There are two main elements that are repetitive in these novels: the relationship between two soul mates and the sickness/death of a loved one. From what I've heard, the books are exceptional, however, the movies always fall short.",2012

5,"This was the first Nicholas Sparks book I read and I loved it, so I had high hopes for the movie. Like usual the movies are never as good as the books are. For some reason they changed a lot of basic info. Like location. Why change the state? Any way the love making scenes were very good so if you are just going for the romance you won't be disappointed. I think that Zack played Logan well. He had a depth that I didn't expect as an actor even though he didn't have much to work with. It wasn't my favorite movie but it wasn't that bad either. Maybe if you didn't read the book first you might like it better. And for those who haven't read it but liked the movie, you should read it. You will love it.",2012
4,"As romantic dramas go, The Lucky One is pretty thin stuff. It has a workable premise and everything, but the movie can't think of anything to do with itself, so it pads out its running time with one musical montage after another. You know a director has run out of ideas when he puts two different montages in about a span of two minutes apart from each other. The film is based on a book by Nicholas Sparks, who has done much better (and worse) than this. This falls somewhere in the middle.",2012
5,"This movie contains eye-candy (Zac Efron) and stunning scenery. It's almost like the director is counting on that to rescue a very weak script. This movie spent over and hour and a half trying to make us ""feel"" the angst of the main characters but instead I kept wanting to slap them into having some sense. I kept thinking that the actors needed more lines and less music to tell the story. It was melodramatic and entirely predictable. I do not recommend this movie in the theaters unless you have money and time to throw away. ",2012

This is neither a good nor a bad thing. So long as the movie can stand on its own feet, it deserves recognition. On that ground, The Lucky One does hold its own. The acting is great and the story held my interest. In the end, specific problems make this movie much worse than it should have been.",2012
7,"Whenever there is a new adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks novel is released, there's always a mass amount of haters and so be it because some of them are extremely cheesy and bad, however I think that the hate towards The Lucky One is unwarranted, I personally thought it was a very enjoyable romantic drama. The Lucky One is quite different to other Sparks movies, I found the storyline to be a lot more serious and mature than normal, and the story being told from the male perspective is also a nice change.",2012
3,"I was completely disappointed with this film - everything I thought might happen, did happen - it was the most predictable movie I've seen of late. Blythe Danner did a really good job, as did the little boy, but the other actors were one dimensional, shallow and unbelievable. Even the story line was unbelievable. Yes, I would be mad if he had not told me the truth but it certainly wasn't a ""you did something so horrible that I want you out of my life now"" kind of bad. In addition to not buying into the whole storyline, this film moved incredibly slow. Long views of Zac walking or looking at her or of her thinking. Maybe if the acting had been better it might have been OK but Zac Efron had one look on his face the entire show. And it was a kind of ""deer in the headlights"" look - really just another Hollywood pretty face with no talent. In my opinion, the sex scenes weren't even steamy because the passion wasn't believable. Other than Blythe and the little boy, there was nothing redeeming about this film.",2012

6,"Faithful readers will know that film adaptations of Nicholas Sparks novels aren't exactly my cup of tea. I enjoy a good romance as much as the next person, but I've found his particular style to be predictable, soppy, and emotionally manipulative. With that in mind, I find myself in the position of reviewing his newest adaptation, ""The Lucky One."" While hardly recommendable, it is admittedly better than I thought it was going to be. It has all the reliable hallmarks of a Nicholas Sparks story – a Southern setting, a sudden love between perfect strangers, characters with troubled histories, outside forces that threaten the blossoming relationship, a sentimental conclusion – and yet it worked just a little harder at allowing me to see past its contrivances. It wasn't hard enough, but progress is progress.",2012
2,"I feel that the plot was predictable and not very well constructed. I could not take Zac Efron seriously in the role that he played. I feel like he had a blank stare (full of no emotion) throughout the movie. I feel someone with his circumstances would have emotion (having lost people close to him, having gone through a war...) Emotion of pain or anger, at least, but I did not feel it, and I have seen so many military movies where the soldiers were pleasant to watch because of their raw emotions- makes for a really emotional, wonderful, movie experience.",2012

The acting was disgraceful, the acting was like something out of a cheap Hallmark movie. The script was boring and bland just like the plot line. Also, there wasn't really a lot of chemistry between our two romantic leads. I have not gotten a chance to read the book the lucky one, but hopefully it was a lot better than this! Gosh this movie wasn't sweet or cute or romantic, it didn't make me feel good, I really miss the notebook! I wish that he still made movies like that. Blithe dinner was actually one actress that I enjoyed and the Pham, her performance was really the only part of the film I liked.

I don't like how they changed the plot of how Beth finds out about the photo, it was a lot better and would've added more substance to the movie when he gives it to Ben and it keeps him safe. I also think they should've had Zues be more prevalent in the movie like in the book. Zues saves Ben pretty much in the book and although it might be hard to train a dog to do that it would've been pretty cool but also the beginning story about him training Zues on the way would've added to it as well. There is just a lot more substance missing from the movie that I saw a lot of other reviews saying they didn't seem to see the character development. I understand a lot of the time books are edited to be turned into movies but in this case it was changed for the worse not the better unfortunately. Getting a few more actors to be the girls on the beach would've cost some extra money and training a dog to do the rescue scene would've cost a lot so I guess they were kinda worried about the costs more than quality. The best part is that Zac Efron is amazing in this and although for me his character was already well developed from the book I think he did a good job in the movie as well!",2012

What I will say to prospective viewers, or buyers of the DVD (when it comes out) is ignore the previous overall rating of this film. Pace perfect, characters well defined, and enough layers revealed though action, amazing light angled cinematography, to grab your breath and mind. Great direction and convincing acting. It's a wonderful story too. And it's the attention to detail that I loved as well. The scene where Logan gets up to leave the pub, but turns around to down his beer, before leaving. Believable stuff. Top movie. Thoroughly recommend",2012

There's no end to his activities, whether it's relating to the shy kid who talks or plays for no one but him, finding an identical lighthouse in the middle of nowhere, curing himself from PTSD in a day, taming the wild dogs like a pro, or frightening fellow hicks just by standing there, this muscle's your man, here to woo random d1tzy girl silly who suddenly found a great man in her life, unlike that douch3bag husband she only married because she got pregnant with the quarterback jock, who also happens to be the top sheriff in town, lookout!

8,"Even though my wife categorized it as a chick flick, as a guy I liked it too. Zac Efron plays a bit of a warrior monk who has returned to civilian life after three tours of Iraq. He is trying to come to terms with his experiences of combat and trying to understand how he made it home alive when others didn't and maybe he shouldn't have. He isn't the clichéd shell shocked/PTSD combat vet, but a good, honest man struggling with his experiences. If you have been to combat in anyway, you empathize with him. Zac Efron plays the role well from the tats to the close quarters combat. Taylor Schilling, Blythe Danner, and the others are good foils to his journey for understanding. My (military) audience was very engaged during the movie, especially (spoiler follows) when Beth tells off her stalker ex-husband. They cheered and clapped for her. This movie won't change your life, but it will help you appreciate it. Take a friend and go see it.",2012

6,"Tim Burton is probably one of the best choices to direct a Dark Shadows movie. He's always good at making Dark, Gothic films and everyone's expecting it to be something like Sweeney Todd and Sleepy Hollow. Instead, it has a hybrid of Corpse Bride and Beetlejuice. It begins with decent gloominess but the rest is scattered with groovy soundtrack and colorful images. But that may not be the problem. It's actually pretty good at recapturing the 70's. The main problem is the plot development. It's fun but also disappointing.",2012
4,"With the admonition, ""I never liked the bitch anyway,"" the Willie character in the new DS dispatched my favorite Dark Shadows character, pretty much summing up Depp and Burton's apparent opinion of her. For me, Dark Shadows was about Julia and Barnabas. Their chemistry created the dynamic that made the show work for me. I'm not only a first- generation DS fan, I'm the co-author of the Dark Shadows Companion. ",2012
3,"Just got back from an early screening of the movie. As someone who like Johnny Depp, I was excited to watch the movie, but nearly ended up walking out of the screening halfway through the movie. There are hardly any entertaining moments, an extremely weak plot, and some very average acting. Sure, Johnny Depp may be a brilliant actor, but there's only so much an actor can do to salvage an immensely boring film. The weak development of the love story, limited exploitation of what could have been some interesting time-travel anachronisms and absurd additions to the plot (like ghosts and werewolves who remain mute spectators throughout the movie only to appear at the very end) were insulting to the intelligent movie-goer..",2012
3,"Oh the possibilities that were missed here. Except for the character names and a similar architecture in the house this film bares very little resemblance to DARK SHADOWS. The movie starts out beautifully and then goes off in so many awkward directions that it never finds what kind of movie it's trying to be. A few scattered laughs here and there do not compensate for a poorly conceived story that meanders itself to the point of being dull and confusing. What can you say about a movie that only comes to life in it's montages set to a pop songs from the early 1970's? Depp doesn't even attempt to capture any of the guilt ridden angst of Barnabas Collins. His Barnabas is a trick or treat Pirates of the Caribbean, very much like a kid playing dress up on Halloween and with two emotions, upset and more upset. Film has some nice set pieces but Burton doesn't bring any true Gothic feeling or sense of dread to the surroundings. The script has that throw everything up against the wall and see what sticks feel to it. Burtons direction comes off in a conveyor belt ""okay, let's shoot this one"" tone with interest only in visuals, which are striking. He's really more of a visual artist than he is a film director. Indeed, one gets the feeling that this film would never have been made if not for Johnny Depp and his love for the original series which is evident here. It's unfortunate that he relies too heavily on make up to carry his performance. Helean Bonham Carter has no interest in being in the film and it shows, doing it only as a favor to her husband. Eva Green is the type of actress Tim Burton is attracted to and loves to cast in his films, but she possesses little of Angelique's spellbinding jealousy. The only one in the cast that has a hint of what these surroundings should be played like is Michelle Pfeiffer. She is the Grande dame of Dark Shadows capturing both the Gothic feel of the original story and the magnificence of the character.",2012
3,"I saw every Tim Burton film since Mars Attacks! at the cinema. Until this came along. I had had enough of Burton's subpar efforts over the years and Alice In Wonderland was his last chance as far as I was concerned. Finally saw this and I'm glad I waited. This is simply awful. Based on a soap opera, Burton doesn't seem to know what to do. It changes tone dramatically from obvious humour involving Depp's character waking up after 200 years of being buried and being confused by things such as television. To grisly kills where he takes out innocent victims. There are a whole cast of characters, each one is given their own story, but none of them are given enough time to develop. Miller, Carter, Heathcote are all wasted as are their stories. I didn't even get the point of Miller, which is a shame because he was great with what he had. Entire scenes have no place in the film, or are needlessly long and repetitive. The main plot seems to have Eva Green asking Depp to be hers and him rejecting her, over and over and over again. It really does feel like snippets from a soap opera condensed down. This is really just a clip show. By the end it starts pulling things out of its backside. Couldn't care for anybody in this film and think the original property should have just been left alone.",2012
5,"While it had a bit of a slow start, with technical limitations being obvious and the characters not being as interesting, from the moment it switched to colour and introduced its most iconic character Barnabas Collins (unforgettably played by Jonathan Frid) the 1966 'Dark Shadows' is a classic.",2016
5,"I am a huge fan of the old Dark Shadows shows. I liked the old series, bloopers and all. I liked the films House of Dark Shadows and to a lesser degree Night of Dark Shadows. I liked the 1991 revival series of Dark Shadows. This new Tim Burton/Johnny Depp version has some good elements in it, like the costumes, soundtrack and special effects, but the problem here lies in the written word. The script relies too much on gags, some funny and some rather lame. The basic characters are mostly here with the exception of the melding of Maggie Evans into Victoria Winters, and the actor playing Willie Loomis does a better job with the character than did the one from the 1991 revival, who chose (or was directed) to play the role as a half-wit.(The one element I disliked about the revival). The 1970s music, cars, costumes and hairdos are spot-on and add to the comfy 1970s feel of the piece. The climax is all special effects and one ""revelation"" of the plot is so absurdly done here that it is (unintentionally) laughable. In all, I would say that this film may appeal more to those who never saw any of the original versions of this than the fans of them. I didn't hate this film, I just didn't love it either.",2012

Could care less about Nightmare before Christmas and Sweeney Todd. Okay, so I'm not a Tim Burton hater. I'm not a huge Tim Burton fan. I think in this situation, I'm as close as you get to the average movie goer. No agenda, no attachments. That being said, this film is terrible. Burton spent so much effort and time worrying about making this film Gothic and off pace, stuffing his favorite actors into the film even though half of their parts were pointless, he forgot he was making a film. It's a simple and fun idea but it feels like ego and ""showiness"" kept them from making the plot even make sense. We get it Tim! You are weird! Don't ruin a good performance by Depp and a fun idea for a film because you have to live up to your own Gothic standards. Grow up. So much talent is wasted on these films having the same look, cast, and feel to them. Take that talent and make something fresh! Stretch yourself just a tad out of that Hot Topic comfort zone will ya? This movie was long, boring, and ruined. All of the funny scenes were in the trailer. By the way.... wasn't this supposed to be the 70's? Other than a shot or two of trees and a hippie van it was just like the set of Sweeney Todd. The whole film felt like London in the 40's. That's bad film making whether your name is Tim Burton or not.",2012
4,"This movie is nothing but an excuse for Johnny Depp to put on make up and clothes and play a foppish character. He does it well, great in fact, but that's not a reason to make a movie. This was very much a disappointment. Too much happens too quickly and other things happen without much thought. Characters are not defined and Michelle Pfeiffer and Jackie Earle Haley are wasted. We have a vampire, witch, ghosts and a werewolf and not much scare or many laughs.. a few chuckles at the 'fish-out-of-water' aspect, but ""Austin Powers"" was funnier and more poignant. I didn't understand the motivations for any of the characters except the witch who curses Barnabas to be a vampire... he essentially uses his servant girl for sex then falls in love with another woman, no wonder she wanted revenge. This was a disjointed piece of distraction. Barnabas kills a bunch of construction workers, which has some scares, then he kills hippies, for laughs. He complains that killing is destroying his soul, but we don't see any reason to believe that. The sets and costumes are excellent as is the cinematography. The only thing missing is a well thought out story. The final shot suggests a sequel... which would be a curse.",2012
4,"The film can't decide whether it's a fish-out-of-water comedy or a Gothic thriller/romance. Instead, we get treated to a bipolar movie that is, at times, really funny, but mostly full of unnecessary exposition. I think Burton wanted to honor the TV show by adding in so many details, but frankly, it was boring at times as they moved from one plot point to another. Some of the ""wrap up"" surprises at the end came off as forced. Though I'm glad they didn't rely on as much CGI to create the set pieces, one major scene involving a concert looked like it was stolen from the Austin Powers films.",2012
9,"Dark Shadows is one of the 5 films I have been eagerly awaiting to see this summer and was very excited when I got a pre-screening pass to see it just a day ago. (I've seen The Avengers, too, so that's already 2 out of the list.) After seeing it last night, I couldn't decide what I thought about certain elements of it until this morning. When a film stays in my head, I know it's made an impression and again, Tim and Johnny have done just that. I can ""replay"" most of the movie in my head. Everyone is the way you'd expect their character to be and they are all excellent in their roles. They've made a film that will appeal to a wide range of audiences. When Barnabas hypnotizes someone, you believe he's doing it. Johnny is amazing, again! The sex scenes, such as they are, imply rather than show anything, but the expressions on Barnabas' and Angelique's faces tell you a lot. The story is (ahem) fleshed out rather nicely as everything is explained in due time and you're not hit over the head with stupid jokes. There is a good balance of humor and drama and even a bit of sweetness when Barnabas is with Victoria Winters (but not the kind that is sappy). Barnabas does reveal who his to Elizabeth but how this transpires and what it leads to is interesting and not played for laughs. Michelle ""gets"" Elizabeth and even her false eyelashes are a nod to the original TV show actress' look. The costumes! Colleen Atwood has done it again. 'Nuf said. There are Sleepy Hollow-like elements in the use and look of the blood, the horror elements (like when he kills) and can I mention the fangs? They come out when he's about to dine. They're marvelous! I will probably see this again with some friends as I'd like to see Dark Shadows in IMAX because, heck, IMAX is wonderful. My recommendation: Go see it! 9/10",2012
10,"The film Dark Shadows opened to an eagerly awaiting audience of both Tim Burton and Johnny Depp fans. Based on the ABC daytime show which aired during the late 1960s which generated a cult following, what was taken seriously in the late 60s / early 70s comes across as comedy today. The majority of the movie is set in 1972 and incorporates music from the Moody Blues (Nights in White Satin) with appearances by Karen Carpenter in a TV scene, a cameo appearance by Alice Cooper and appearances by four of the original Dark Shadows actors including Jonathan Frid who passed away shortly after filming. Rated PG-13 for comic horror violence, sexual content , drug use, language and smoking, one of our 14-year-old critics, Raven Devanney rated it 6 out of 5 stars for ages 13 and up. Here's her take: Dark Shadows Reviewed by Raven Devanney http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2NE6UPSLcM Dark Shadows is a hilarious movie about a man named Barnibus Collins, who is cursed by an evil witch when he refuses to give her his love. Turned into a vampire, Barnibus is locked away in a coffin for two centuries. Now, freed by unsuspecting construction workers, Barnibus finds that his home town of Collins Port has drastically changed. He must learn to fit into the 70s while protecting his family, restoring Collins Port to its former glory and riding himself of the evil witch, Angelique, who cursed him to be a creature forced to hide in dark shadows. I absolutely loved this movie. Johnny Depp, who plays Barnibus Collins, did fantastic! Johnny is one of my all time favorite actors and when he teams up with director Tim Burton, you know it's a film worth seeing. The cinematography was great because of the gloominess that you will often find in Tim Burton's films, but they found a flawless way to thrown in the bright colors of the 70's. The special effects were great too, especially in the end when Angelique's skin started to crack; she really looked as if she was made out of porcelain. Something that did bother me about the visuals was that the blood in the film looked way to fake considering that it is a vampire movie. My favorite character would have to be that daughter of the Collins family played by Chloe Moretz. One; she is my favorite young actress, two; she played a moody, mellow dramatic, angsty teenager perfectly. The acting in this film was priceless because there was a lot of over- acting, but not in a cheesy way, it was done very purposefully and it gave a wonderful comedic feel to dramatic situations. I suggest this film for ages 13 and up because of sexual situations, mild drug use and language. I would give this film 6 out of 5 stars because it far surpassed my expectations!",2012

1,"Warning: a few spoilers but nothing about the ending: I have been a fan of Dark Shadows since the days of the late 1960's and running home from school to catch the show when I was 9. I tried to go into this with an open mind. I promised myself that I would realize this was not going to be my beloved Dark Shadows but hopefully something of value to see. The entire opening sequence, where young Barnabas leaves for the United States to the building of the Collinwood estate to Josette's jump off of widow's hill had me cheering in my seat-YES this was going to be fantastic (though all of the opening storyline was terribly rushed, including Angelique putting the curse on Barnabas).",2012
3,"I guess I will start out by saying that I am a huge Johnny Depp fan and that I even like some of Tim Burton's works (Beetlejuice and The Nightmare Before Christmas). However, that being said, I did not like this film all that much. If you are looking for some comedy in this film, then go and watch the trailer, because most of the funny parts are in it. I understand that this film was supposed to be a spoof of the soap opera that appeared in the 1970's, but it really fell short of my expectations. I remember being in elementary school and rushing home to see what was happening on Dark Shadows. In this film, not only did I not want to see what happens next, I really didn't care. Johnny Depp (Barnabas Collins) once again embraced his character and does a really fine job of making the character believable, but the content just wasn't there. I don't think that this film ever decided what it wanted to be when it grew up. There were elements of comedy, horror, drama and even a little romance. There was some jostling around in this film between Barnabas and Angelique (Eva Green), but you could almost sense the wires that the actors were tied to. And is it just me or does Bella Heathcote (Victoria Winters/Josette DuPres) look a little like Anne Hathaway? Victoria and David Collins (Gulliver McGrath) gave a whole new meaning to the phrase ""I see dead people"". I guess my favorite character in the film was Willie (Jackie Earle Haley) who was Barnabas' sidekick. He was fun to watch even though he did not have many lines (thank goodness). This film may end up sucking the life out of your expectations. By the time you get to the end of the film, things get downright silly and stupid. The last ten minutes of the film I kept thinking to myself .. oh brother. Also at the end of the film there was almost a hint of a sequel; man I sure hope not. Not all of the Depp/Burton collaborations have been successful and this is one of them. If you just want to see Johnny Depp on the big screen, then by old means go. However I think that this film should be locked in a box (redbox). As sure as my blood is red, so is the light for this film.",2012
2,"After making a really bad Willy Wonka & and a quite terrible Alice in Wonderland, the Tim Burton ----Johnny Depp pairing presents us with the jackpot. A shockingly puerile Dark Shadows. Having interesting sets and lots of make up is not sufficient to make a good motion picture. The use of ""humour"" is awful....well worn jokes about the ""fish out of water"" theme, and other predictable nonsense & rubbish.....the weak, tired dialogue is simply not good enough. The central story (actually there is no perceptible central story !!) is so badly handled ....this may go down in history in the cult genre of ""one of the worst movies of all time"". This really is Ghastly Gothic Garbage. Tim Burton always gives us lots of heavily made up actors, bad scripts and good looking sets. However, these things become tiresome after a while ....even the Tim Buton ""fans"" must see this as a very impotent movie. Take a holiday Mr. Burton. Come back when you have a new idea. We have seen all of this before.",2012

3,"Translating television shows to the big screen is part and parcel of popular film-making dating back to the 1950s. So it was no surprise that Dark Shadows, the legendary Gothic horror soap opera that ran from 1966-1971, came back to the big screen in 2012. Unlike the earlier low-budget films made after the show's demise, this one was to be a big budget star vehicle from director Tim Burton with a cast that included Johnny Depp. On the surface, it looked to be a wonder mix of a director and star getting the chance to bring a mutual favorite of theirs to life once more. What it became instead was something of a mess.",2016
3,"I'm about as big a Dark Shadows fan as the next person who grew up on the series. I feel closer to the Collins Family more to my real relatives, but this movie is like watching a high school drama class trying to act out the dirty secrets of my family at exaggerated and misinformed levels. I was expecting something more from the mind of Tim Burton of ""Sleepy Hollow"" fame, not the Tim Burton of ""Willie Wonka"" infamy. To me, Dark Shadows was about a family living in a haunted house, and one of the relatives was a vampire. The campy aspects of it were barely noticeable, but in this interpretation, they are elaborated and stretched thin for comedy effect. Yikes!!! Johnny Depp plays a distant and ignorant version of Barnabas Collins whose best moments are trying to understand the Twentieth Century, and Eva Green plays a much more malicious and unscrupulous Angelique, a far distant cry from the tragically romantic version by Lara Parker. One saving grace is Michelle Pfeiffer as Liz Stoddard who looks timeless in the Joan Bennett role. Chloe Grace Moretz plays Carolyn in very small doses scattered through the movie, and Helena Bonham Carter gives a new spin on Julia Hoffman as a washed-up alcoholic psychiatrist scared of getting old. The movie is very loosely based on the events of the series, the characters are taken in directions they shouldn't be taken and new developments and scenarios are created. Looking very much like one of the animated dolls of ""The Corpse Bride,"" Bella Heathcote wanders through this insane asylum of caricatures and eerily feeling right at home. The final climax between Barnabas and Angelique looks and feels taken from ""Death Becomes Her"" with some very late plot points and revelations tossed in. I was bitterly disappointed with this film, which at times seems more like one long dirty joke. If it was not for the original Sixties series to compare it to, this adaptation might have stood alone as a parody of horror movies, but instead, I consider it an insult to a series that both inspired my imagination and still haunts my dreams. However, for a truly worthy legacy of the series, it might be best to check out the 1990s mini-series with Ben Cross and Joanna Going that was so unjustly canceled.",2012

Don't get me wrong--its not that Taylor Kitch or Aaron Johnson aren't decent enough--both play their roles with exactly the same kind of stiffness that i guess suit their characters' circumstance but neither really add anything beyond what the screenplay has already provided them.. like if this were made say 10-15 years ago and you'd of had Steve Zhan and Ben Affleck in it i'm not saying it would've been batter but the two of them would've made you care for what might happen to the main characters a bit more i feel like. I'd rather not get into the lack of any kind of convincing emoting from Blake Lively here--- (She's supposed to be afraid for her life here--and somehow its like she's barely miffed---its as if instead of her life that's being threatened its her wi-fi connection.) having read the book this was based on--the character O in the story was a lot more resourceful and a lot more crazy then Blake Lively ever suggests in the two hours of running time---would that they had cast literally anybody else in her part,just off the top of my head would Lauren Ambrose from six feet under have been considered too old??? would Krysten Ritter??? would Kirsten Bell?? hell Alexis Bidel might of been able to pull this off better (and as much as i love Rory Gilmore emoting was never exactly her strong suit) at least Blake Lively's narrating was OK...i just really wish they could've found someone who could have really put this movie over the top here.

If you have a problem with the portrayal of Seals or the realism of the scenarios then lay the blame on the book not Mr. Stone. Some of the scenes were certainly quite gory, an increasingly common occurrence in many films these days. So if that turns you off then don't watch the movie.

If you do, then the movie to see is the 2001 movie Blow with Johnny Depp; I've seen just about all the drug dealing based movies and few come close to it.

From the beginning, you get great character knowledge and some back story as to where things are going in the story. The plot line is just amazing! I loved the whole inside look at legal marijuana in California as well as the Mexican cartel portion. Some parts of this movie were absolutely terrifying! And some were quite heart warming.. Overall, it was just a great mix that really kept me entertained the entire way through! I've always been an Oliver Stone junky and he really nailed this one to the wall. I created an account just because I looked up this movie and saw that it's rating was under a 7! The problem with IMDb is right here, people writing their opinions unknowingly persuading someone else to not go out and see an awesome movie. People - if you haven't seen this, it is definitely worth your time and money, at the very least, you will be entertained. With all of the new movies coming out and worthless remakes appearing everywhere, this movie restored some of my faith in Hollywood. Lastly, I thought the cast was brilliant!

1,"Is this movie meant to be taken seriously? Because I laughed through the entire thing. Blake Lively as O makes for a certain shoe in for the worst actress of the year at the razzie awards. Very nice Shakespeare reference. Not. The end beach sequence with her looking into the camera as the sun sets in the background was proof of how she is better suited for Calvin Klein cologne commercials, not major motion pictures,certainly not an Oliver Stone drug cartel ""drama"". Seriously, her and Taylor Kitsch should have just made a porno and called it a day. Kitsch's flaring nostrils and egregious dialogue in this film make me wonder how he will ever get work again. Oh wait, he was hired after John Carter. Never mind. Worst.Actor.Ever. Not one shred of personality on screen. His interaction with Aaron Johnson throughout the film as they shared joints and talked about their love for O was so contrived...I hate watching actors who I can tell are acting. I wasn't able to get lost in this film, I was aware of the acting and lackluster writing the entire 2 hours plus. The only ""believable"" part was when Ben and Chan were riding dirty with 300 lbs of weed in the van and the cop behind them flicked his lights on but ultimately went speeding past. That sense of relief is something to which I can relate. Otherwise....  Two weed entrepreneurs sharing a blonde bimbo who brings nothing to the table expect for her willingness to spread her legs..?!??Unbelievable that she was so special and irreplaceable. The trio lived in Laguna Beach, there's like a million ""O""'s there.  If the love triangle was so ""special"", perhaps the viewer should have been informed why. Otherwise the movie looks like a stoned guy with  PTSD and his  Buddhist lover  trying to ensure that their source of vagina wouldn't be compromised to a Mexican drug cartel. Chan couldn't ""last three weeks""...O could only last ""like 7 to 10 days."" WTF? My favorite part: When O asked her kidnapper for weed via Skype  ""I mean the stuff we're all killing each other for"". Hahahaha. I laughed so hard at the ending. I didn't realize this film was supposed to be a stoner comedy?  Benecio del Toro, Emelie Hirsch and Selma Hayek are lucky that their career isn't over after agreeing to be in this POS.",2013
7,"I got a kick out of reading the popular Hated It reviews about Savages. It's all very funny. It's the same with some other films that Oliver Stone made in recent years. But is Savages really that bad? In my opinion it's not that bad. It's a fine film actually. But its flaws can be irritating. When I began watching the film I wondered if I turned on a dirty movie. But no. That was just Chon (Taylor Kitsch) and Ophelia (Blake Lively) having their special time. Maybe it's not that special because later Ophelia has the same time with Ben (Aaron Taylor-Johnson). I hope Stone included these scenes just to show that these three are very close. Fine. A little later though viewers are treated to what passes as a commercial promoting the use of marijuana. Fine. The three lead actors show little range throughout the film. But I didn't think that this was a problem because it keeps the film entertaining instead of too dramatic. It's entertaining but it's not easy to watch sometimes. It's a simplified, glossy, watered-down and often violent representation of the War on Drugs and Mexican drug dealing. The Mexican Drug War is still ongoing and several dozen thousand people have been killed because of it. For anyone who doesn't know I'll mention that the war is just a result of America's economic policies. So-called free trade drove millions of Mexicans out of work and into poverty and crime. On the other side of the world, in Afghanistan, the Americans and the British have deliberately increased opium production for export to neighboring countries, especially to Russia. Genocide as a result of drug use and drug trafficking is an old British trick that goes back centuries. It's an interesting topic but I don't pay much attention to it. Savages is kind of a peek inside, though it doesn't get into the seriousness of the issue. Even if Kitsch, Johnson, and Lively aren't sympathetic leads the film still has memorable performances from Salma Hayek, Benicio del Toro and John Travolta. The screenplay by Shane Salerno, Don Winslow and Stone can be considered a cheat. It doesn't just raise a question mark at the very beginning of the film, which I didn't like. It also tarnishes the ending. I would have just preferred the upbeat version without the downbeat version. But, like I mentioned, it's an entertaining film that does have something to say. Its running time is a little over two hours, however the time goes by fast. For me Savages turned out to be an engaging film. Dan Mindel's appealing cinematography is a benefit too. I didn't think that I'd like it when I saw the trailer, but it's a well-directed crime thriller. I recommend it.",2013
3,"I love movies and watch them with an open mind remembering that this is somebody's art. Even the most open of minds can't make sense of this film, and it was just torture to watch for several reasons. First, that narration by Blake Lively was flat, and poorly written, making it a constant annoyance throughout the film, and making her seem replaceable. So why would we care if she is killed by some drug lord? We were hoping for the relief. Second, there was the absence of a back story that would explain to any intelligent and modern audience why these two handsome, rich, guys would waste their time on some average looking, obviously non-monogamous, space cadet, much less share her sexually, much less trust her with all their confidences, much less be in LOVE with her. What was there to love about that character other than her readily accessible vagina? Third, dear, dear Mr. Stone: if you want to make the audience fear for the delicate kidnapped flower's life by showing us gore scene after gore scene of torture, death, and blood-smear everywhere, why then would you create a character like ""O"" (I think the two guys were just too disinterested to remember her entire name) who, after being kidnapped and roughed up would DEMAND to talk to someone, to have better food, to have a better room from her psycho kidnappers? Lively's character just came off as a shallow, annoying, whore. Could this have been worse? Oh but wait, it does get worse. Aaron Taylor-Johnson, who is arguably one of the best young actors today, is wasted as the laid back guy, while Taylor Kitsch is once again typecast as the heavy. And how many ex-SEAL's are likely to support such an unpatriotic and illegal business when they can make so much legal money as stunt men, consultants, or action figures? Then, out of nowhere, we see Emile Hirsch cast in some nominal role he made the best of, but again, was totally wasted in, and frankly, I wish they had cast him in one of the lead roles because it would've been a much better movie. Benecio Del Toro has now been typecast as the psycho more than once, but at least he didn't mutter or turn into a werewolf. John Travolta was good as the corrupt DEA agent. Salma Hayek was good as the conflicted ruthless widow-cum-cartel-queen-and-loving-mother role, but the woman had a lot of hats to wear in that one character as if the director couldn't decide if she was a heroine or a villain in his very disconnected film. Lastly, I'd like to say, I wish Taylor Kitsch would be given permission to act, because from what I've seen of him in his other films, he's more than eye-candy, and without good direction, it seems like he is being limited in range, not to mention being written into a character that has little credibility. I'd have been impressed if we had been given an explanation of his name: Chon. Is that an acronym for Confused, Handsome, Orphaned, Narcissist? There is no chemistry between him and ""O"" whatsoever, and typically, the type of man who would qualify to become a SEAL is not a man who would risk rotting away in federal prison for money made by illegal means, and is definitely not the type of guy that would be best friends with the type of guy played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson, or the kind of man who would entrust his heart to a promiscuous surfer-shopping-mall-rat. So Mr. Stone, a little explaining about how these (3) were so irreversibly committed to each other in such a new age kind of no-boundaries-free-love-keep-O-pampered-way, so as to be willing to DIE for each other would have been a favor to the audience, as well as possibly connecting some facts leading to an actual plot a lot more credibly. Where is the story? Do your job. And fire the continuity and editing departments. You're no Guy Ritchie, that's for sure. And people only like Quentin Tarantino because he likes to out-weird himself with every movie, but even gore and torn bodies can get boring if there is no point to the splatter. You had an opportunity to make a love story gone wrong. You first have to convince us that there IS love. What bonds these two men with this vapid and shallow woman? What we DO see is the love between a boy and his bong, between a boy and a posse of smart employees, between a boy and his local DEA agent, between a boy and his money, and between a boy and his ""wargasms."" Whoever wrote that line should be shot. Whoever made Lively utter that line should be retired from directing.",2012
6,"Can't really decide how I feel about this film. It was somewhat intriguing, beautifully shot (in black and white), and the lead character was perfectly cast. I love quirky characters in independent movies, but most of the time I couldn't decide if Frances was incredibly endearing or incredibly annoying. Immature, yes. Quirky, yes. Childlike, yes.",2013
5,"Greetings again from the darkness. All the critics are raving about it. Love abounds for the latest from director Noah Baumbach and his co-writer and leading lady Greta Gerwig. What makes my ambivalence even more confounding is that I'm a fan of Baumbach (The Squid and the Whale) and Gerwig (Greenberg). The expert level of filmmaking and acting is obvious, the script details and dialogue are exceptional, and the situations and setting are realistic. So why aren't I more excited about this one? That's what I've spent the past few days wondering.",2013
9,"Is it fair to call Frances Ha a product of the mumblecore movement in cinema or is it all too, well, professional? Noah Baumbach's examination of culture, early adulthood, and obsessive friendships not only makes for a good, topical debate but a very worthy motion picture, as Frances Ha is one of the strongest films this year. Heavy on dialog, characterization, and the strong, stable topics to examine, this is a thoughtful mediation on what it means to grow up, stay true to your friends, and be self-reliant.",2013
9,"Being called ""undateable"" is sort of like a team player being labeled ""uncoachable,"" not a strong recommendation. This label tags maturity-challenged Frances (Greta Gerwig) in Noah Baumbach's warm-hearted comedy Frances Ha, a film that has genuine affection for its characters. Co-written by Baumbach and Gerwig and supported by an eclectic soundtrack that includes music by French film composer Georges Delerue and the songs of David Bowie, Frances Ha (the title is explained in the film's final shot) is a film in which people talk and act like real human beings, not cardboard caricatures manipulated by a self-conscious script that ""strives for reality."" Though the film is full of light-hearted energy, it does not strain to be quirky or ""in your face."" It is clever because that's the way it is.",2013

1,"Warning this review does contain spoilers! I really wanted to like ""Frances Ha"": after all it is an independent movie, right? Anymore, I wonder what kind of weight the term ""independent"" carries at least in the realm of movie-dom. This was the second movie that my friend and I saw that evening so we chose ""Frances"" because it seemed like lighter fair from the spy movie we saw earlier. My friend found the film mediocre at best, my criticism was much more harsh.",2013
5,"Noah Baumbach co-wrote 'Frances Ha' with his current significant other, Greta Gerwig, the actress who plays the title role. It's Baumbach's take on a 27 year old aspiring dancer/choreographer who just can't seem to get herself together. Slate Magazine's Dane Stevens describes Frances as ""childlike and disorganized."" Stephen Holden of The Times has an even more prescient descriptor, describing Frances as one who operates under a sense of ""entitlement."" The film is shot in black and white and it reminds me of the 1962 French New Wave flick, 'Cleo from 5 to 7'. While 'Frances' is not filmed in real time like 'Cleo', it has the same feel: expansive shots of the care-free, largely self-absorbed protagonist, who prances about, highlighted by one urban backdrop after another. Baumbach clearly wants us to link his film to the spirit of the French New Wave, as he employs the famed French film composer, Georges Delerue, to provide much of the film's soundtrack.",2013
10,"Noah Baumbach and Greta Gerwig lead us on an expansive journey that takes place in the confines of several years in the life of a single character - Frances.

5,"I really really wanted to like Frances Ha. . . indie film, good critical reviews, black-and-white homage to Manhattan/Woody Allen, something different from the usual summer blockbuster movie fare. . .my wife and I left the theater feeling flat, however. Greta Gerwig does a fine job acting as Frances and portrays the malaise of young adults trying to find their way in life quite accurately, but. . .it's just not that funny, people. A comedy needs to have more laughs, and a drama needs to have more compelling characters and more action. I've not seen the TV series ""Girls"" which this is being compared to, but it does have the flat failed sitcom gestalt, the one that lasts half a season before cancellation. Caveat emptor, folks.",2013

2,"I had high hopes for this movie, I really did. We ended up seeing it because Blue Jasmine wasn't showing anymore, which seemed like a natural choice since Frances Ha was being touted as a a'modern Woody Allen-movie' http://goo.gl/0sHCY2 (which in itself is a stupid classification since many of Allen's movies are timeless, but whatever).",2013

But if you like that show, you might like this (although I didn't). If you despise ""Girls,"" I can almost guarantee you won't like this movie. Unlikeable, spoiled characters throughout, with very little plot. Greta Gerwig is a disaster as Frances, and I think this is probably the last Noah Baumbach film I will be subjecting myself to. But because it was so critically revered, I thought I'd give it a shot.",2013
1,"Maybe I wouldn't have hated it quite so much if I were female, in my late 20s, sharing New York apartments to save money, deliriously unrealistic in my career expectations, clueless about personal relationships, unwise with money, and unable to plan beyond the moment. But I'm none of those things and thus I did indeed hate this movie. I think the filmmakers were going for some sort of modern update of a French New Wave movie in which nothing happens and every conversation is banal, trivial, no more interesting than any everyday conversation you might overhear if you were a fly on the wall who actually cared about these people, though no fly in its right mind would. Well I certainly didn't, anyway. I know I was supposed to be charmed by the good-looking-in-a-normal-everyday-way main character played by Greta Gerwig, whom I have never noticed before and expect never to notice again, but I was completely uncharmed. In fact, the only effect her helpless, hopeless, needy clinging character had on me was to make me want to run from the theater, which later, after sticking with the movie to the end while nursing an ever-dwindling hope for a story, I actually wished I had done.",2013
1,"If you ever wanted to reinforce your little imagination with images of how small, petty, and shallow female relationships are, watch Frances Ha. Perhaps when you grow up you will appreciate Sex in the City. Also watch if you are a bona fide hipster. This black and white film is truly colorless and one dimensional. It may appear original if you have never seen a Woody Allen film but still falls flat. I prefer films with characters who express an opinion. The main characters of this film profess to have an opinion but really never express anything in particular. It reminds me of exactly what Woody Allen focuses on, complains about but ultimately, Allen's films rise above the fail whereas this film only supposes or claims it has. Unfortunately, through the hype and critical support it has received, Frances Ha's only achievement is to demonstrate that there is no soul or ""magic"" in the life of young adult, privileged class hipsters.",2015
8,"Frances Ha is a very good film. And It's almost indisputable that Frances Ha resembles Woody Allen oldest works. The satire against the so-called intellectuals, the satire of a - perhaps ridicule aspect of society, that is the obsession with organization and patronizing, and the fact that the character - the protagonist - is an allegory, each one of these aspects are present in Frances Ha. Of course, there is some originality on here. The black and white choice, the occasional 80s beat which pops out of nowhere and ends fitting perfectly the scene, the great acting by Greta Gerwig - all of these are aspects which makes Frances Ha an unique film. And the dialogs are nothing like in Woody's films - sure about that. There is some surreal dark- humor on them, and adds to the uniqueness of the film in general. Overall, very well written, acted and directed. ",2014

Films whose ""bitter, angry characters"" are stick-figure caricatures embodied by actors neither complex or talented enough to make their character's bitterness or anger anything deeper than a mere external affectation, directed by a clever hipster con artist hiding the heart of his arch conservatism.",2013
1,"So, incidentally, Frances is an apprentice dancer for a professional dance company in NYC at the age of 27. This is absurdly out of touch with the realities of the dance world. If she were so fortunate to be associated with a professional dance company, she would have had to be focused and disciplined enough to endure a physical regimen that would have trumped all of this silly girl's petty indulgences. The movie is a fantasy about an ignorant and condescending, wannabe charmer who has no idea nor any interest in the art of dance or the daily struggles of anyone anywhere. Please, who cares what happens to this phony, self- indulgent poseur and her gang of narcissistic friends. No mention of the harsh realities that prevail outside her bubble world. A movie that inadvertently but perfectly indicts the superficial sensibilities of these spoiled children and the makers of this movie. Americans are pretty much reviled amongst much of Europe these days. Self-indulgent, destructive and oblivious certainly. Charming? In a word, no.",2013

1,"I don't even know where to begin. You'll see the ending coming within the first 10 minutes. Not the kind of ""film"" you want to invest and entire afternoon watching. Don't torture yourself following an unsympathetic character around for a couple hours as she fails and fails and then fails at failing at her lifeless, miserable, daily existence. You'll want to kill yourself before she does. Did I want to? Yes. Did I? Of course not. I had to spare my life to warn others. The exploration of darkness and tragedy in the life of a character is admirable, but not if you leave us there in the darkness with nothing left worthy of redemption. Regroup. Rewrite.",2014
2,"Just saw ""Frances Ha."" Uh...why was that a movie at all? Depressing to see that much youth and beauty be that dull and boring. And the concept was not at all anything new. Which is what I found the most annoying aspect to it all. I saw Slackers back when I was one. I've seen every Woody Allen, made, I saw all french film back in the day's when they weren't vintage and liked King Of Hearts so much that I bought the soundtrack on vinyl when I was in elementary school.",2013
6,"A festival favourite last year, Frances Ha quickly earned a reputation for being Noah Baumbach's best yet and feeling like Wes Anderson plus Woody Allen. With those two filmmakers in mind, I couldn't have been more excited for it. I quite like Baumbach too, he's a welcome addition to the writing team with Wes Anderson's films, The Squid and The Whale is a great film and while Greenberg is only good, Greta Gerwig was a total highlight. He has an interesting quiet sense of drama that I can sometimes really connect to. However, Frances Ha was incredibly disappointing. Consistently mildly irritating is the phrase I'd use. It's far too in the middle, rarely approaching dramatic extremities. I didn't connect or empathise with Frances as she had very little at stake and little to do in general.",2013
5,"I'm still trying to figure out why this film left such a weird taste in my mouth. It's odd, coming out of a film and having NOTHING to say about it. Possibly, it's because almost nothing happens.

If you take this movie on face value - a humorous pure popcorn movie with no hidden meanings to teach you the values of life, it's pretty good. I don't see why it's getting bashed because for what it is, it was entertaining and funny. Before you go in to see this movie ask yourself what exactly you want to get out of it, if it's 1 hour and 20 minutes of mindless entertainment, then you're set. If, however you feel Project X will leave you pondering life and everything around you, this movie is not for you. Don't listen to the old people on here who knew what they were getting themselves into and still paid and saw the movie only to turn around and rate it poorly because it was below whatever expectations they have for a party movie...",2012
9,I walked into this film thinking this film is going to be a rip-off and be a stupid predictable party movie. Though some things were obviously predictable but isn't all comedies predictable.,2012
7,"like many have said before me, if you are going into this movie expecting some potential Oscar material you will be sadly disappointed. The best way to approach this movie is to not expect anything at all but a bit of over the top entertainment provided by an out of control high school party. If you are too old to remember the days when you were in high school and attended a party that seemed to get a little bit crazy, I would not watch this movie. I think you need to have had some kind of crazy party experience in the past in order to take that event in your mind and multiply it by 100 times. But you won't HAVE to create that scenario in your head, because that is exactly what project X does for you. ",2012
8,"Project X is a film that, on paper, does not appeal to me at all. I predicted it to be a low budget film with some unmemorable gags and a poor plot. I was wrong. It was a surprisingly good film. The plot did, as anticipated, contain several holes and you couldn't help thinking ""surely that wouldn't have happened"" but after all it was based on a true story.",2012
8,"I swear I'm never going to get bored of the found footage genre. Maybe I'm just simple, but it has the ability to breathe life into tired genres. Or maybe I just really allow myself to get carried away with it all. Project X is that simple story of the outcast kids throwing a party to become popular. It soon spirals out of hand, but what Project X does right, is that it makes sure to really push it ridiculously far without betraying its set-up. None of this would work if we didn't have some lovable protagonists to root for. We have our hero Tom, the friendly and most normal guy. JB is the slightly rotund geek that tries to act sophisticated, and finally we have Costa. A big douchey dick. This could go horribly wrong, but his pranks are often harmless and Cooper plays it in a way where you can see how desperate he is for attention. It makes him very sympathetic, even when you can't believe how outrageous he is being. The film builds up the party slowly, which is perfect. It starts off with a few drinks. The dog is then attached to helium balloons, and once the ecstasy comes into play all bets are off. The film is also littered with those bizarre curiosities that often make great comedy, which thankfully it doesn't overuse. Two of my favourites were the 11 year old security guards. I would have liked to have seen more of the party halfway through, as it turns into a huge montage of hilarious moments. Overall, this is a riotous teen fantasy, where people act like cocks, but you somehow hope they succeed in one way or another. In such a politically correct world, I'm kind of glad it didn't pussy out.",2012

The movie has worried several people due to the fact that teenagers are represented in a very negative way. Reports of imitations of the Project X party have also been in the news. ",2012

His parents are going away for the weekend, admonishing him not to touch Dad's car, make sure Dad's office is locked, etc. etc. etc. All the time, Thomas' ""hilarious"" friend Costa (performed extremely well by Oliver Cooper) is pushing pushing pushing for Thomas to host an insane party to boost their credibility, his other ""hilarious"" friend (the obligatory fat one) is hanging around, and the entire proceedings are being filmed on an enormous hi-def video camera by a fourth kid who no-one notices. And, of course, hundreds of people turn up leading to the house being trashed (burnt, car in the swimming pool, riot police, trees in the street on fire, press helicopters etc.) Perhaps this is funny if you are a teenager. Personally, I found the Costa character (effectively Jonah Hill's character in Superbad only immensely more offensive, and the driving force in the events which destroy his friend's house) the most repellent character I have ever seen on screen outside monsters like Uday Hussein. It isn't so much that things get out of hand (although they do), it is more that Costa is pushing pushing pushing all the time with a total lack of respect for other people's hard-earned belongings or for their desperately needed peace and quiet.",2012

But something about this one rubbed me the wrong way - indeed, to even refer to it as a ""movie"" seems wrong: there were scenes chronicling the party that basically devolved into mini-music-videos focusing on naked girls. And not even in tantalizing ways -- rather, these scenes felt creepy (especially since a lot of the girls featured are supposed to be high schoolers) -- for example, the director relies upon paparazzi-style upskirt shots. And because the movie is shot a la Blair Witch/Cloverfield etc. with its ""found footage"" style, it only makes these shots seem all the dirtier and more voyeuristic.",2012

I am not against movies of this genre, and I knew I wasn't viewing a future Oscar-winner when I walked in, but this was predictable and trite in every way. Even if the subject matter (high schoolers throwing a party when the parents go out of town), has been done before, there could have been an attempt at a plot, but there was not. Project X is unrealistic, sexist, and slightly anti-Semitic. In addition, it's expected for movies of this caliber to make alcohol and marijuana seem cool, but the casual use of ecstasy in the film takes it too far. At one point of the movie, I thought perhaps this was only funny for high schoolers, but I would never want a high schooler to see this and receive a message that if you take ecstasy you will have a great night and no matter how much trouble you get in, the fun you had will be worth it. This is therefore a failure for all age groups. At least I thought I would laugh, even if the plot is lacking, but I was mistaken. This is a cinematic waste, and it makes me cringe to think of the money that goes into actors, writers, camera crews, props, and the set for this movie, which is a hemorrhoid on the butt of society. During the film, I kept trying to think of a worse movie I have seen in my lifetime, but absolutely none come to mind.

The special effects were not very realistic either. The plot was designed to be a dramatic thriller but it was so pat it was boring. I almost left before the ending as there was no mystery left shortly into the film. Also, the two young people were rather lackluster and the pilot was annoying. For something that held so much promise of a lovely adventure, it was a big disappointment.",2012

3,"I cant spoil the story as there is barely any to find.  The only one/s who truly earned any coin in this movie are the people  who did the trailer, because they managed to put together a clip from  the none existent content of the film.  Suffice to say, I can bet you the 80 million dollars to that took to  make this film that first graders and/or some random drunken people in  a bar can come with a better screen play.  Its so bad that you can see everyone of the actors in the film can not  believe they are actually going through with this scene after scene.  Its so excessively dull that I wouldn't even want my children to see  it.  The ONLY thing you can do to make this film bare-able is to turn of the  audio and watch it as a mute film. Anything you could imagine about the  dialog would be better.  I'm only giving it a 3 because believe it or not I've seen worse ( :  And CGI? Maybe we could have enjoyed the CGI if it wasn't crushingly  burdened with carrying the dumbest dialog I've seen in years.  I'm only wasting my key taps on this ""film"" on the off chance that this  will save someone the waste of time.",2012
6,"I hate to admit this. But I actually enjoyed this movie... I feel ashamed but it's a bit of goofy fun. Far superior to it's overlong, too silly predecessor this fun, energetic fantasy adventure movie keep things moving quickly. After a short but cool setup reintroducing us to the Josh Hutchinson character from the predecessor as he's escaping from some cops after breaking into a satellite station. He soon engages his stepfather played by The Rock and discovers a message from his grandfather about the mysterious island. Moving things along quickly they get there and it's filled wonders from giant lizards, mini elephants and sharks, giant bees they fly on, a gold filled volcano. All visualized in a bright, cheezy sort of CGI that is reminiscent of the 1950s monster, adventure flicks that inspired this one. Sadly, I skipped this in theaters but from what I've seen the 3D must have been pretty amazing. Of course not a lot of the movie makes much sense, but I think it's important to shut your brain off when watching it. it's a very entertaining popcorn flick. There a few laughs, some exciting action set pieces and even a little romance. And as for performances Michael Caine and The Rock leave a better impression than Brendan Frasier left in the first one, Vanessa Hudgens is fine in a supporting role and well Josh Hutchinson is looking pretty good. He's definitely a good actor and his movie star looks are starting to show. So all in all it's more fun than you'd expect ignore the cynics and go in with an open mind. 3.5/5",2012

Yes son, they apparently did. This, coming from a kid who watches The Disney Channel all day, has GOT to confirm this movie sucked just by him being in it. The Rock is one of my favorite ""fake"" athletes who went the way of the mainstream but he couldn't pull this movie out of the gutter. Plot is disturbingly bad and the ""Why did they do that?!?!?"" factor was WAAAAY over 10 so I would say PLEASE wait for the ABC premier to avoid spending ANY money of this trash! Special effects were cool to a certain extent but hey, even trash has value. The CGI crew should have been paid more than the actors. ;) Overall, I wish I had 2 more arms so I could give this garbage 4 Thumbs down!!!! Jeeeah!",2012
1,"Oh, where do I start. Firstly, the plot progresses Wayyy to fast in the beginning. The main character claims to be a.""verneian"" has obviously never read a book write by Verne. Anyone who has read ""the mysterious island"" can tell that the kid gets almost all his information wrong. They do a good job of explaining why there was a island there after it had sunk in the end on the novel, but why did they have to include atlantas? if it exists The mythical city would be located in the Atlantic ocean and not the south pacific. I rated it 1 out of 10 because I laughed at one or two of the jokes that were exchanged between the rock and Michael Caine. They could have easily, easily made the movie follow the book more closely, Captain Nemo sailed the world until all of his.crew had died so how did his dead crew bury him? This is a terrible movie. I fell asleep for 15 minutes in the middle of it. The jokes were not funny, the acting was meh and the CGI was terrible.

There are times where the actors look just as lost and staged as the script they are trying to bring to life.",2012
1,"The movie was bad and horrible. It has too much suspense to be a family movie, and it has too little suspense to be an action movie. The plot makes NO sense whatsoever. For example In the beginning (SPOILER ALERT) The grandfather randomly sends out a note electronically across the world to land in a random place just so his son could find it. What...the...heck?!?!??!?! What makes him so sure his son would receive it? THE CGI IS TERRIBLE, Oh..My...Goodness......It looked so fake, it King Kong (Black and White) was better in fake things than this! The actors are terrible, except for the Rock. I also don't get (WARNING: MAJOR SPOILER) How an island that's been around for hundreds and hundreds of years sink in 3 days. There is also subliminal Satanic messages and pictures hidden in the movie. I do not advise you to see it, so good luck! Jeez!",2012

And this weariness now extends to this sequel with only cast member Josh Hutcherson returning as Sean Anderson, in a follow up story that's loosely set in yet another Jules Verne novel called The Mysterious Island.",2012

So they head off to The Collector's house of horrors to find her...",2012
8,"So here is something new for me -- Watching a horror movie sequel, not knowing it's a sequel, and it being good enough that I want to see the original. Weird, huh? Don't get me wrong, it has it's faults. An incredible body count that would draw the attention of the CIA, FBI, and any local police much less the Criminal Minds-type teams. It's completely impossible to have that many dead bodies in building and it not just REEK of death to the point you can't go in. But... it's a horror movie. Just go with it.",2012

3,"Wow. To start, I am a huge fan of The Collector. This film has no semblance to it's precursor. It is the worst, laziest pantomime of a Saw film bordering on parody. The editing is abysmal with nonsensical smash-cuts in the action sequences that will make your brain hurt. While The Collector definitely lacked in the logistics department, it more than made up for it in direction, framing, tension, mildly clever visual metaphors and the pivotal plot elements. The Collection dumps all that out the window and goes for a straight up poor man's Die Hard. The setup is beyond paper-thin, the characters unsympathetic, undeveloped, and uninteresting. Goddard must have had to push pretty hard for this to get green lit...but I don't understand why. This was clearly phoned in, rushed, uninspired and no care taken in it's development...yet a third film is teased in the epilogue.",2013
9,'THE COLLECTION': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five),2012
6,"I feel the rating is accurate with a 6 out of 10. Could be a 5 but it's a pretty good film, reminds me of Saw more than 'The Collector' did. Very gory and a little outrageous with the violence actually. It's not as realistic as the first one (even though neither are) simply based off of the first killing scene. No serial killer could get away with such crimes in reality especially one who studies bugs for a living and doesn't at least have military training to make him the badass he's portrayed as being. But I'm not going to be such a pessimist, it wasn't bad. It was a relatively short film so it's straight to the point. If you're a fan of violence and gore this is your film.",2013

7,"""Saw"" and ""Feast"" series veterans Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan keep up their predilection for inventive nastiness in this intense, atmospheric production that is at least on a par with the original ""The Collector"". One still has to be prepared to suspend their disbelief quite a bit, but Melton and Dunstan do get high marks for showmanship, if not subtlety. The movie never tops an early set piece set in a club, which - aside from the plethora of digital gore - may have some horror fans howling in appreciation. As before, there are plenty of elaborate booby traps and torture devices, and characters who are mostly thinly written; many of them are just there to add to the body count. Not that that's necessarily a bad thing.",2014

A guy with a broken forearm (so badly broken in fact that it's dangling in an L shape from his arm) gets in the fight with the collector at the end and wins by throwing him down a laundry chute... with both hands. Now, I fully understand you don't watch a horror movie for believability, but that's rather pushing it, don't you think? The movie was a tired rehashing of every piece of torture porn before it. Nothing new here. They even managed to make Arkin boring, and I really liked his character in the first film. ",2013
7,"While I do agree with many of the bad reviews blasting the poor editing and missed opportunities. I am still glad that this movie got made.

Can Arkin survive another round of hell? I will admit that I did like the Saw series, but because of the actual story line and not because of the huge amounts of gore, although I will say that did add to the story. The Collector was trying so hard to be Saw but never quite got there. I'm not sure why they made a sequel but I sat down to watch. While this one had much more gore and many more people being cut up it was essentially the same movie as the first one. I realize people that watch these aren't in it for the plot, but there needs to be some difference to warrant a sequel I think. On the other hand this movie is pretty much just made for people who love gore so I could be wrong. Overall, a little over an hour of blood and dismembering, so if you are into that then this is for you. I give it a C-.",2013

Two, it needs to keep the viewer engaged (tense & on the edge of their seat). Three, it needs to make you at least to some degree care about the victims.

10,"I have to say that I have seen a lot of horror movies and this by far trumps them all. Although many seem to think it is a copy or is trying to go for the Saw movies in terms of style and setting, The Collection is in a whole different category by itself. From start to finish I left the theater satisfied as I might ever be after seeing that movie. It is mysterious and well directed. I say mysterious, because you think you know what is going to happen, but really you have no idea what you are in for. Without a doubt, The Collection is far more greater than its prequel The Collector. However, The Collector in terms of its intensity throughout its movie is far more greater then The Collection. The Collection proves itself to be true and worthy in the genre of horror for sure. With all these B-movie, low-cut, ridiculous movies these days in the horror genre, The Collection makes the first Halloween look bad. Josh Stewart who reprises his role as Arkin, does a phenomenal job. He fits the role as Arkin so well and I don't think anyone could have played his role any better. Throughout the movie he gives off the feeling that he is done and wants nothing more to do with the collector, but in all truth, you leave with the question is he really done? Emma Fitzpatrick, who plays the role of Elena,also does a phenomenal job as well. I was very proud that none of the female characters had the same characteristics, personalities, and attributes like you see in other horror movies. Though that might sound sexist, I am not trying to go down that road. I am merely trying to say that in horror movies the women always run screaming making it easier for the killer to catch them, they always beg and beg as if the serial killer won't kill them, and other feminine character traits and things the writers always have the characters do. Elena is not afraid to fight and gives her character a bad-ass reputation. Overall, you will leave this movie satisfied and wanting more. I give this movie a 10, because Marcus Dunstan did his own thing and directed this movie tremendously. The setting was mere perfect in the sense that it isn't always in the woods,on a farm, the middle of nowhere, and other repeating settings. Its screenplay was written with perfection and and perfected by the actors and actrices themselves. The movie itself is real, it makes you feel real as if you are one of the victims of The Collector. The movie is also very realistic. The blood and gore though it is not real, seems to be after you watch it. The guts were realistic and not fake in any way. The whole movie is just one genuine piece that cannot be made ever again in terms of someone else trying to remake it. The movie just makes all these horror movies look bad, and I cannot stress that enough. The Collection is far more better then the first movie The Collector, and carries The Collector on its back if you want to make a case for it. Rarely do you see a sequel better then the first movie, but in this case you do. You cannot go wrong with this movie and if you do, well you must not be seeing the movie for what it really is. The plot, the setting, the characters, the outcome is simply put a work of art and will have you wanting more as I mentioned before. Arkin wants revenge, and you will be able to feel that, when you watch it, you will feel Arkin's pain, his want for revenge, his story, his life, but mostly you will feel as if you are Arkin, because you are.",2012
5,"In my opinion ""The Collector"" was a very underrated film. ""The Colletion"" is a worthy sequel, but it is far from perfect. Dunston and Melton came up with a great way to continue the story, but the cracks show in this follow up. They decided to go the ""Aliens"" route and introduce a band of mercenaries that attempt to track down the collector, save the life a young woman, and put an end to his crimes. They bring our hero Arkin, fresh off his escape from the hands of the collector, to guide them through the collector's maze. The story itself is awesome, but shoddy dialogue slightly derails the story. The practical effects are great, but many of the traps seem recycled. Josh Stewart, as Arkin, is enjoyable as always. Don't get me wrong, this is an fun movie, but at only around 75 minutes, the story is too fast paced and a lot of the creepiness is lost in favor of ""gruesome"" death sequences. Not having Randal Archer return was also a mistake. It was nice to them revisit the story, but hopefully if they do it again they will take a little more time fleshing out the characters and getting rid of some of the dialogue. If you do see this movie you will at least walk away saying ""Arkin is hardcore!""",2012

I do not know if it was my low expectations before the screening, but I actually enjoyed this movie very much. In order to enjoy this movie, however, you do have to somewhat detach yourself from thinking too much into the wealth of racist and crude humor contained in the movie. Nevertheless, The Dictator is satire, it is a movie making fun of the real world, and if you let it be, it makes you aware (while laughing) at the racist thoughts and stereotypes ordinary people have everyday. Yes, it has its strange and explicit scenes, but overall, I think it has substance and it was very funny. Put your ""Victorian"" influences aside for a night and have a good laugh. Watch it.",2012

The film is short but packed full of laughter. Perhaps I'm an easy laugher, but what can I say, I liked it!!! A LOT!!! As well as the comedy being brilliant, the actual plot/storyline is superb also. From watching the trailer, and then watching the film, it was actually a completely different story to how I thought it was going to be. I wasn't very excited to see the film after the trailers, but decided to venture in... I enjoyed it much more than I expected and will likely see it again! It isn't for the easily-offended but if this is your sort of humor then you need to go and watch it now!",2012

If you read the news on a daily basis and know what's going on in the world you'll like this movie. Some people may not like Cohen but I think he's a genius. It really takes something to show the problems that we have in a funny way. However you should really go and watch that movie, it's worth the money. I personally watched it twice in theater. Now I really don't know what to write anymore without giving away any jokes because the jokes come one after another. I was already laughing out loud after one minute. It's really cool if you watch a movie in theater and everyone in the room is laughing. So my definitive final conclusion is that The Dictator is more than a movie, it's an experience ;)",2012

While on his way to the United Nations, he's betrayed and shaven so no one would recognize him. He's taken in by Zoey, a vegan hippie, and gives him a job at her store. Will Aladeen make it to the U.N. to stop democracy from coming to his country, or will Zoey change his heart? I would definitely recommend THE DICTATOR!!!",2012

The actors are C- storyline is weak There are some funny line here and there. Borat was excellent, however this was disappointment. The Ali G show was great when it came out. This was a continuation of The Ali G show.There was a lot of racism and typical stereotypes but most were overplayed. This movie was probably done in Sasha mind in a 5 minute dream. I am glad i did not pay to watch this movie. I guess when he spilled the ashes on Ryan Seacrest this was a sign how bad his movie was.

10,"Don't know where to start. Just been to see this film and could never stop laughing. When I thought it couldn't get any funnier, it did! Sacha Baron Cohen is clearly an excellent writer as the jokes in it are genius. I love the humour of it! Although it is a short film, the jokes that it includes seem to pay off. As well as the comedy being brilliant, the actual plot/storyline is superb also. From watching the trailer, and then watching the film, it was actually a completely different story to how I thought it was going to be. The plot made the film funnier. I would recommend that you all watch it as I would certainly watch it again, a lot more as this film is a work of art. It isn't for the easily-offended but if this is your sort of humour then you need to go and watch it now!",2012
1,This is up there with one of the worst movies I have ever seen. And I loved Borat and Bruno. To me it's lazy and completely predictable. With none of the shock elements of his previous movies. I can't tell you how bad this movie was. But what I am amazed is it got 6.7 so far in IMDb which now makes me doubt this site. Overall the core problem is that the subject matter ie dictators just does not offer the same scope nor the opportunity to give you that real scenarios where the main character is causing caos. This to me was Sasha with a bigger budget not knowing or caring of the outcome. Brutal. Every joke was obvious. The accents were terrible. It just like any originality. I sat there with a sense of disbelief about some of the scenes. Really really disappointing. But then the trailer didn't suggest much. Butni thought given it was Sasha that it would be great. Brutal,2012

2,"This film was a disappointment to say the least, not just by the terrible acting but also by the structure of the film. Sasha has really let himself down with this one, from the days of Ali G indahouse and Borat you can clearly see that he has sold himself out. This film consists of a poor attempt at comedy that cannot be described as more than 2 stars (just like the cast). If anybody goes to see this film with any expectation please don't as you will see the harsh reality of what once was a comedy genius selling himself out to Hollywood in order to make big money instead of sticking to what he knows best. The surprise element in the Dictator was  Nothing! I watched the trailer before and that's all that was in this film apart from a terrible script and woeful acting throughout. All I can say is please just stick to the trailer and do not waste ninety minute of your life you will never get back.",2012

Quite provocative yet well put together. Enjoyed it greatly.. and I will likely to watch it few more times. Unlike the Borat, this is a movie with everyone being actors, so effectively series of skits - aka SNL. Quite a few details captured in the movie, so watch and laugh! Few scenes (like in Borat) went over ""my line"" but all in good fun If you like Borat, you will love it... otherwise, you will hate it!",2012

Now, we can all see that Ru and the judging panel wants Alaska Thunderfvck 5000 to win. In the earlier part of this season (as well as season five of the normal Drag Race show), Alaska was judged fairly with the rest of the queens. In this last episode (RuPaul's Fish Tank), Alaska's advertisement wasn't nearly as humorous as Alyssa's, or even Tatianna's (who was in the bottom). Her runway wasn't as fierce as Tati's, Detox's, or even Roxxxy's. I was once a fan of Miss Thunderfvck in the competition, but now, it just seems that the producers have it set so she wins everything she possibly can. I wish the judges would go back to judging on the substance and beauty of these queens, rather than simply doing whatever Logo asks them to do.",2016

8,"...in this case, changes from the book/original TV short. A lot of people have been lamenting the ""frame story"" this movie adds in, as well as the idea of making the Once-ler a human character. As far as the frame goes, it's done pretty well. It's a bit flat but perfectly enjoyable for younger kids. Making the Once-ler human, though? BRILLIANT. Hear me out. The original Once-ler was a faceless force of destruction, a shadowy embodiment of greed. This Once-ler is just a stupid kid with a dream, a guy who wants to change the world. He's not evil, but he lets his success get to his head, and that brings about his own downfall and the destruction of the forest. That's FANTASTIC, and here's why: that's how the world really is! Companies don't sit around all day cackling about how much smog they're pumping into the atmosphere; it's a process, and something that happened gradually. Obliviousness is just as dangerous as maliciousness, and that's a really powerful lesson. This can happen to YOU if you're not careful; anybody can hurt the planet if they don't pay attention. That's a rare lesson, and one I'm really pleased to see in this movie. ",2012

As a whole, it's colorful and fun but it feels very different.",2012

The creators of DESPICABLE ME takes a header with this CGI and 3D feature. Animated films like this one rely on the vocal talents of its stars. Diverse stars sometimes bring life to enjoyable looking scenes. And sometimes you have a whirl of pretty cinematography going nowhere. You decide. Twelve year old Ted(Zac Efron)is wanting to impress the sweetheart of his dreams Audrey(Taylor Swift)by presenting her with her heart's desire...a tree. In the process Ted will meet up with The Lorax(Danny DeVito), the keeper of the only trees, and exchange thoughts of hope, love and promise. Miss Betty White is wasted giving voice to Ted's Grammy Norma. DeVito at least probably earned his paycheck. Efron is as interesting as plaster. Swift was sweet enough. When I viewed THE LORAX, the only real reactions I noticed came from the ""pull-up diaper set"". I would imagine Dr. Seuss might be a little disappointed too.",2012

In a number of reviews I had read previously, there were smacks of political overtones, blah, blah, blah. Are you serious?! ",2012
2,"My boy liked this movie. He is 6 years old. His favorite part was when the Lorax says to the fat lady ""You're a woman?!?!"" And that about summed up the show for him. This movie demonizes corporate culture as the blackest of black...and beatifies the environmental movement as the whitest of white. There is no gray here and if I had not been with my son, I would have walked out and asked for my money back. I had to spend a few minutes at bedtime tonight explaining to my boy that what the movie was really saying is that there is a good way to run a company and a bad way to run a company. The man in the movie did not run his company right because he did not shepherd his resources appropriately. Not ALL companies are bad though...I had to explain. I am appalled that this movie forced me to do that. I don't care how the story is in the book...this movie was an iron fist in a velvet glove. I don't remember all the lyrics...very few of them actually...but you could write an entire review on the ""Bad"" song. During that song, the poster on the wall in the background with ""Too Big to Fail"" written on it was totally unnecessary. Don't get me wrong...I am not defending the moral failure of the people who ran the economy into the ground in 2008 because of their inability to control their greed...I am simply saying that the message of this story could have been told in a far more intelligent manner...for the benefit of the adults and kids. The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars is...well...I am not sure why. The animation is nice...but that's about it. Give me WALL-E any day of the week. This movie was terrible.",2012
1,"I was skeptical from the beginning, I saw the commercial and was utterly disgusted. After watching the movie, that was an understatement. I grew up with the original Dr. Suess book, I read it to the point that I had memorized it by age 4, I can still recite parts of it today. I found this ""movie""(if you can even call it that) an utter disgrace to Dr.Suess' name. I don't even know where to begin, first off, the animation was horrible and one of the best parts of the book was the artistry of the illustrations. Secondly, there was a love affair. No. This is Dr. Suess we are talking about, not ""The Notebook"". And the humor in this is horrible. It wasn't funny and I didn't appreciate it in a serious movie. On top of that, the Oncler was an utter disgrace. The Oncler is supposed to never be seen, he is seen and portrayed as a main character. That for me, broke the deal. This movie did no justice what so ever to the book and was a complete waste of my time.",2012
4,"For a children's film to work, it usually has to cater to both the children and the adult that brings the children to the film. Movies such as Shrek and Wall-E have perfected the tightrope dance that this requires. The Lorax throws that idea right out the window—and suffers considerably in the process. Instead of finding a way to please both audiences within a single storyline, the creators of The Lorax created two parallel stories—one for the adults; another for the children.",2012
6,"When I saw the trailers to this movie, I was groaning. The book and original animated movie were both very good, and upon seeing this remake with the love plot, and the whimsical antics really put me off it. I thought I would see it anyway and hoped it would surprise me, like Up. I was pleasantly surprised (but my expectations were very low, so that wasn't hard). First off, the animation/design. The animation was very good, and the scenes indicated that it was made for 3d (which it was). The designs are very Dr. Seuss like, the birds and fish were very similar to the book, as were the trees (the fish looked similar to the one in the Cat in the Hat). The streets and roads were ridiculously wavy and loopy, so they were exactly like a Dr. Seuss creation. The Lorax was very similar to the book as well. Now lets look at what the movie does good and bad in terms of characters/plot. This is a remake/expansion, I didn't expect it to be accurate to the book entirely. The Plot is; a young boy wants to find a tree for a girl, so he leaves town to talk to the Oncler, the only person who's ever seen a tree (apparently). The Oncler tells of the time when trees were active, and the Lorax who protested to the Oncler's removal of them. With this knowledge, the boy seeks to restore the trees to the city despite a rich business man trying to stop him. This business man sells air. It's kept in bottles and cans, like water (Spaceballs reference?). He's just a generic, corporate bad guy, and not a very interesting one. The main complaint I have with this movie is the romantic subplot. It feels like this was created to rationalize caring for the trees (maybe I'm misreading), it seems unnecessary and annoying. Many of the Jokes fell flat for me (but that's a matter of personal preference). The movie should have been about the Oncler and the Lorax. I liked the direction the movie went with the relationship between the Lorax and Oncler, it was a tragic friendship which played out pretty well (I thought it should have been given the forefront instead of the made-for-this-movie romance plot). The relationship could have been done better with more interactions as the Oncler rises in wealth, but for what it is, it's pretty good. The Songs also annoyed me. They were kind of annoying and saccharine (with an added comment from the characters to sometimes point this out, as if to say ""look at this, its so cutesy but its okay because we've pointed this out""). the only song I enjoyed was:",2012
8,"""Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better, it's not."" Ted (Efron) is just like any boy. Rides around on his bike trying to impress the love of his life Audrey (Swift). Her dream is to see a real live tree. The city they live in is made of plastic and air is sold in bottles. When Ted's grandma (White) tells him of a man called the Once-ler (Helms) he risks everything to go and talk to him. I have to admit the only reason I really watched this is because my daughter wanted to see it. I am actually glad she forced me to go because I really enjoyed it. There is enough adult stuff mixed in to make it enjoyable for everyone and not just kids. Danny DeVito being cast as the Lorax is genius and actually makes it funnier. I expected this to be a total ""Save the world from humans"" type movie but while the message was there it didn't seem preachy and was more funny then anything. If you are looking for a good family movie this is one of the best ones to come out in a while. Overall, much, much better then I expected and one of the best family movies in the last few years. I give it an A, my daughter gives in an A+.",2012

For that matter most adults might not be able to either. Does not hold candle to other good animations, such as Toy Story, Up, etc.. that were actually good movies. I think I have made the point, not sure why I need to have 10 lines of text to make my statement.

All I need is just one more line of excellent comments and I have wasted 10 minutes on this review.",2012
3,"I took my 3 year old to see this, while my wife took my 7 year old to see The Secret World of Arrietti. I wish I saw the Ghibli movie instead. This movie can give young kids all the wrong impressions on capitalism, the simple satisfying way of earning money through hard work, and being made to think all companies are big, bad and evil!? I can see the movie's point, which was more extreme than the book I might add, but it rubbed it into the ground until the dirt was gone and all you could see was ugly clay. The plastic jokes were funny, but there seemed to be no threat to the characters at ALL, they cough on rare occasion and would open an air bottle akin to Spaceballs on occasion, but that was it, nothing a Halls cough drop would cure. I love Pom Poko, and like Wall-E, but this was rub it in your face environmentalism than I have EVER seen done in a children's film. Funny thing is, when Seuss published The Lorax America was much more self sufficient back then than we are now. We had more steel, metal and industrial companies compared to what we have now. The red haze over industrial cities are gone, as well as are the products which are made mainly over seas now. Was this movie made for third world countries? And when I have to explain to my son how more forests are taken down mainly due to housing projects and more and more garden (Cookie cutter) homes with itty bitty yard is more of a culprit for missing woods and forests, while we have many empty houses elsewhere (like our own personal neighborhood) and even more half empty strip malls every 3/4 mile around us. I'll agree we're a wasteful society, but to make it out the whole world hinges on one seed...seems a bit much to me. People are planting trees and gardens and greenery all the time. Dustructive weather seems to be doing a better job of taking down trees right now than any company I know of. Plus those ""smiling pretty kids"" (that can't act and only read cue cards) over at Disney Channel seem to be planting plenty of trees over and over on their commercials with the FLOTUS. Let them do it. But while the Lorax looked the part, the movie looked good, sounded good, but it was so focused on plot, the characters seemed to lack some depth especially one connection they made obvious near the end, but didn't even resolve. If you're not a tree hugger, pass on this one. And the only thing that was memorable for my 3 year old was the same scene we saw on the trailer... the whole ""THIS is a woman!?"" line, and the poor Lorax was treated like Beetlejuice, his use was lacking over-all as well. The main point I could get out of this movie was and old man tricking a young boy to do something illegal(escaping town over and over) so the old man could see the boy every day and tell him stories... there's something a little sick about that to me too... but the graphical representation was pure Seuss to the end and that at least looked great, just wish the movie's plot had been a little better.",2012
2,"I saw on Wikipedia that this was on ""List of films considered the worst"", I have a seen a majority of films from the star of Big Daddy, many of them have been rubbish, I had to see if this one would be the same story, from Razzie nominated director Sean Anders (Sex Drive, Horrible Bosses 2). Basically in 1984 young Donal ""Donny"" Berger (Justin Weaver) has a crush on his teacher Mary McGarricle (Eva Amurri Martino), she is a hebephile (has a sexual appetite for teenagers), she begins a sexual relationship with him. This relationship is discovered during an assembly, Mary is sentenced to prison, it is revealed she is pregnant, custody of the unborn child goes to Donny's abusive father until Donny is a mature age. Twenty-eight years later in 2012, adult Donny (Razzie winning Adam Sandler) is a broke alcoholic slacker who spends his time with his friends, bartender Brie (singer Ciara) and her stripper mother Champale (Borat's Luenell), his grown up son changed his name to Todd Peterson (Andy Samberg), he is embarrassed by his father's immaturity, he is a successful businessman planning to marry his fiancée Jamie Martin (Leighton Meester). Donny learns from his lawyer Jim Nance (Rex Ryan) that he owes $43,000 to the IRS in back- taxes, he will be imprisoned for three years if this is not repaid by the end of the week, with his previous period of celebrity he agrees with TV producer Randall Morgan (Dan Patrick) to attempt a televised reunion with Todd and his mother in the women's prison, for $50,000. Donny arrives in Cape Cod, finds Todd, and tries to convince to take part, Todd introduces everyone to Donny as his friend, having previously told them that his parents are dead, Todd refuses to reunite with his mother in prison, not knowing about the TV show. Todd initially argues constantly with his childish and obnoxious father, but slowly he changes his opinion, even imitating his behaviour, Donny is allowed to attend a bachelor organised before the wedding, and his son bonds with Brie at the strip club. Todd does finally agree to meet his mother, the older Mary McGarricle (Susan Sarandon), at the prison, having bonded with his son Donny tries to stop Todd from going, knowing that the TV crew are waiting, but he is too late, Todd does get some time with his mother, but they are then ambushed by the crew, Todd is disgusted and leaves, therefore Donny does not get the money. But then Donny hears a conversation Jamie has that could change everything, he assumes she has been sleeping with Todd's boss Steve Spirou (Tony Orlando), this turns out to be false, however she has been having sex with her own brother Chad (Heroes' Milo Ventimiglia), she is willing to give Donny $50,000 to keep quiet about the affair. Donny decides to go against Jamie's hush money to stop the wedding, he gets the help of his celebrity buddy (Razzie nominated) Vanilla Ice, he reveals to all spectators that he is in fact Todd's father, tears up Jamie's cheque and forces her to admit her infidelity, he is disgusted and breaks up with Jamie. In the end Todd finally acknowledges Donny as his father, he even goes back to using his birth name Han Solo Berger, he starts dating Brie, and offers to help Donny to pay the unpaid taxes, he refuses and is prepared to go to prison, in fact Donny gets the money he needs winning a long-shot bet he placed, Donny and Han celebrate with all their friends. Also starring James Caan as Father McNally, Will Forte as Phil, Blake Clark as Gerald and Razzie nominated Nick Swardson as Kenny. Sandler has played a slacker many times, his character is also a former tabloid celebrity with his claim to fame being that he screwed his teacher, in this he is just another boorish moron, Samberg is mildly alright as the more mature son of his, the appearances of great actors like Caan and Sarandon is pointless. This film I will admit made me titter in some small places, probably the same goes for the critics that give it two stars out of five, but it is crammed with predictability, not very amusing slapstick, stereotypical characters and annoying sentimentality, and its gross in some moments as well, it's just a terrible comedy. It won the Razzie for Worst Screenplay, and it was nominated for Worst Screen Couple for Sandler and either Meester, Samberg, or Sarandon, Worst Screen Ensemble for the Entire Cast and Worst Picture. Pretty poor!",2015
2,"In short, a comedy without any comedy. While I regularly enjoy disgusting remarks in movies, I was often laughing at how bad the jokes in That's My Boy were rather than at their humor. Between Adam Sandler jacking off to an elderly woman, and the uncreative quips made about the statutory rape involving him and his teacher, I felt embarrassed for the actors who had to deliver the ultimately atrocious lines. And just when I thought the movie couldn't get any worse, it threw a horrific curve ball with the incorporation of incest to heighten the conflict between the bride and groom-to-be. The insertion of this was not only distasteful, but a weak attempt to add originality and intrigue to the already ridiculous plot line. That's My Boy is yet another representation of Adam Sandler's downfall as an actor, and modern cinema's desperation to push the limits too far past socially acceptable. An overwhelming disappointment.",2014

See people need to stop critiquing a comedy like this based as though it was a movie in another genre. But thats just my opinion, If your looking for something funny I recommend seeing this.

2,"The set up for this movie -- which has a teenage boy impregnate his female teacher -- played to the lowest common denominator, and was exploitative, tasteless, and mean spirited, but at least it was funny. The rest of the film, which has Donny (Adam Sadler) trying to bond with estranged son Todd (Andy Samberg), does not have a single funny joke. Not one joke worked at any level, though the number of gags must have numbered in the dozens or maybe over a hundred. Instead, ""That's my Boy"" is unrelentingly loud, obnoxious, and boring. At one point, I even felt sorry for Vanilla Ice who gave a cameo performance in this movie. I think Vanilla was trying to present the image of a cool, humble, and genuinely nice guy, but unfortunately nothing can offset the jarring performances of the rest of the cast. Perhaps what I hated most about this movie, apart from the fact that there was not a single funny joke after the set-up played itself out, is its underlying message. This film appears to be saying that Donny's obnoxious, rude, drunken, and downright stupid behaviour is superior to the civilized and ethical behaviour of polite society; and that everyone would be better off in the end if they were as obnoxious, rude, drunken, and stupid as Donny himself. If this message (which was clearly targeted to the people who show up for the Jerry Springer show) was not clear enough in the beginning and middle of the film, it was positively deafening at the end. As it turns out, fiancée Jamie (Leighton Meester) may seem like a sweet, polite, and civilized rich girl, but that's all fake because she was secretly having an affair with two relatives while engaged to Todd. So given its lack of laughs, the way it celebrates bad behaviour as something for others to emulate, and its cynical use of father-son bonding to make itself seem sympathetic and the opposite of mean spirited, ""That's my Boy"" gets a resounding thumbs down.",2015

1,"That's My Boy is content with being a belligerent vulgarian comedy that it is willing to concoct any setup, any one-liner, or any character as long as it's on par with its irredeemable crude standard. It's first fatal flaw is that it erects so many raunchy situations that it completely undermines the characters that are involved in them, which is the whole reason we laugh. We laugh not at the situations themselves, but how these characters react to them. But this is only the icing on the cake of disgust.",2012
10,"I want to start off by saying I have never been so confused by movie reviews in my entire life. Did people watch the same movie I saw? That's My Boy is the funniest Adam Sandler movie and in my opinion the funniest movie I've ever seen. I did not go longer than 5 minutes without hysterically laughing at the scenes in this movie. As a fan of movies such as Wedding Crashers, Old School, Step Brothers, 21 Jump Street, Superbad, and Forgetting Sarah Marshall just to name a few, this has to be the funniest movie out of the bunch. If you're looking for more than just laughs, than maybe the movie might not be right for you. And do not go into an R rated comedy expecting no dirty jokes. This is Adam Sandler at his raunchiest and funniest.",2012
1,"No spoilers here, because I had to turn it off after about 25 minutes. That was literally as much waiting to see anything remotely funny or interesting as I could stand. And which makes me sad since I've liked, and even loved, other Adam Sandler films. When given a decent script with true humor and character development, he's displayed enough goofy charm and heart to overcome far-fetched situations, over-the-top, cartoonish, secondary characters, and a propensity for bad accents. This script wasn't even close to decent. The premise was totally unfunny at best, and probably takes the cake for sadness and sickness. Crudity substituted for freshness and humor, and not only were all the secondary characters cartoonish and undeveloped, but so were most of the leads. Sandler's character was totally devoid of charm, and his accent may have been the worst ever. Since his company produced it, he has no one to blame for a pathetic, crude, boring script but himself. And his choice begs the question: what was he thinking?",2014
1,"For his last movie he broke a record with the Razzies Awards in getting 10 awards in every category such as Worst Movie, Worst Actor, etc. You would think he could not hit more rock bottom. That is unless you've been unfortunate to waste your hard earned money, and more importantly your time, in seeing this movie. Perhaps they will add a new category for this years awards so he can do another sweep and break last years record. I am not even going to comment on the movie itself in this review, as that is just even more time from my life I will not get back. I am going to turn on the TV and watch anything that's on to get my mind off this, even an infomercial on the Shake Weight, as that will still be orders of magnitudes better then this movie.",2012
1,"Why do I go into Adam Sandler movies with the hope that each new offering will be the one that redeems him as an actor, a writer, and a producer? You'd think I was a masochist or delusional or both; although I've willingly subjected myself some truly abominable projects of his in the past two years alone, including ""The House Bunny,"" ""Grown Ups,"" ""Just Go With It,"" ""Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star,"" ""Zookeeper,"" and ""Jack and Jill,"" I've also seen him expand his horizons towards more mature, more compelling endeavors like ""Punch Drunk Love,"" ""Reign Over Me,"" and ""Funny People."" Hell, he even won me over with ""You Don't Mess with the Zohan,"" which certainly is of the same raunchy, tasteless caliber as most of his other films. He has surprised me before, and I live in hope that he will surprise me again.",2012
1,"After seeing this horrible film (on a dare), I was confused. How could Adam Sandler take such an absolute nosedive in his career so quickly and completely? I mean, he's demonstrated that he has some talent and knows how to make a funny movie (Wedding Singer, Zohan, etc.), and even his mediocre movies (all the others) aren't really truly awful... until Jack and Jill and now this. He does seem to be actively campaigning for his very own Razzie category at this point. ",2012
10,"And why did it rock? Because Sandler went back to his simple, old formula...giant man-child refuses to grow up! He never really impresses me all that much when he tries to get serious, but remember Billy Madison? Happy Gilmore? The same giant man-child who refuses to grow up formula works again! To all the people out there bashing this movie, pi-- off. If you're not a fan of toilet humor, then no, you're probably not going to like this movie. But if you're an Adam Sandler fan who loves his earlier stuff, this one is right up there with Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore! Hilarious! And Nick Swardson, of course, is hysterical as always! A perfect ten out of ten for me!",2013
7,"okay look, I'm one of Sandler's biggest fans. No jokes. I spent over a year learning a Bobby Busche impression, just for the amusement of myself. You guys are too hard on him. How can a guy not make a few flops??? This film wasn't even bad. Other than the over use of crude jokes, it was good. If you edited about 10 or 15 minutes of the crude and sexual jokes out of this, it would've been Sandler gold. The character he played was really original, not one of those family guy characters he just keeps on playing over and over. It was like his mid 90 characters like Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison, the ones that made us love him. Of course, it wasn't as good as a character. Overall, a pretty fair film that could've been great with the edits. I really don't know how you can say you walked out of the theater?!!! Same with Jack and Jill, it was bad, but it didn't deserve the horrible reviews. The guys made about 20 massive hits, how's he not gonna make one or two flops??? Anyways Sandler, make the edits and re-put it in theaters and I think it'll do way better.",2012

Of course not four together and of course the front row. If they had been together I pretty much know we would have pulled the chute early on. I had little tolerance for Sandleresque scenes prior and now I can't even look at the guy (ok that might be a little strong). Notice I am not talking about the movie even after I checked the spoiler box. I lost any desire to waste my time doing so. Seriously, if you have a sink in the house half clogged with nasty blacken old waste rejoice in getting it cleaned out.

Maybe I'm wrong, either way I doubt that anyone who liked his earlier stuff or Grandmas Boy, Hall Pass, The Hangover, Horrible Bosses etc.. wont' like this.",2012
1,I am a fan of Adam Sandler but my god this movie is horrendous. My wife and I went to an early showing of this one and it was OK at first with the young version of the Adam Sandler character hitting on his teacher who gives him detention only to have sex with him and getting pregnant and going to prison for 30 years. After the opening credits it all crap. Sandler's character was a huge jerk in a very white trash way and nothing coming out of his mouth was funny. Pair that up with the character of his son who is a major wuss who has is very socially awkward person who has to take several prescriptions and carries an extra pair of underwear in his shirt pocket in case of emergency despite becoming a success after moving out of his dad's and you have an unfunny and overall difficult to watch film. After a little less then half the movie my wife and I couldn't stand watching it anymore and for the first time ever we walked out. Do yourself a favor and do not watch this it is a waste of money.,2012

Did we need a whole movie about how awful it is to be engaged to a gorgeous, funny, intelligent woman that you make sacrifices for? I just don't understand the point of it. The leads were cute enough together, but it didn't feel like a real relationship. The peaks and troughs were all so contrived and predictable. And all the ""comedy"" hinged on genitals, dead grandparents, Andy from Parks & Rec except inexplicably successful, and an Asian man with a thick accent. Really? It's 2012, guys.

Great cast, beautiful locations -- no excuse. With all of the great scripts that can't get funding, what genius gave this poor attempt at comedy the green light??!!! No wonder the theater was empty! In addition to the bad directing, editing and writing, the film was almost two and a half hours! It was painful to sit through.",2012

6,"No groundbreaking ideas or themes are presented in The Five-Year Engagement, but that doesn't mean it's not entertaining. Spurts of slapstick, a dash of vulgar humor, generous helpings of uncomfortable awkwardness, and a pinch of melodrama seasons the film with a cross of genres and unexpected laughs. Although moments of sudden darkness cloud the generally light-hearted mood, the greatest achievement for writer/star Jason Segel and writer/director Nicholas Stoller is that the characters are never despicable and retain a likability that typically shirks away from roles designed to have dramatic, dynamic ups and downs.",2012

5,"Alas, this is another example of a movie with some possibility – it has a plot, decent casting and acting, some humor – but it still manages to leave the viewer, for the most part, having fallen into the pit of displeasure. Once again the writers have chosen to forgo sparkling dialog, or even intelligent dialog, in favor of the gratuitous foul language and blatant sex. Such a waste. Makes me wonder if today's screenwriters opt to cop out on creativity on purpose. Or - have they no imagination? Do they assume the theater audience has none? Trust me, a few things left to the imagination can be far sexier,and probably funnier and entertaining than the in-your-face stuff. And tossing the F word around like confetti at Mardi Gras is boring. Maybe this actually does indicate a severe lack of talent on the parts of the writers/producers. Or could it be that movies like this, that have their moments, but not enough of them, are produced for the soul purpose of making the good movies look even better. Just a thought.",2012
1,"The first minutes of this movie seemed promising, but it quickly sank into a horrible, slow paced film where nothing seemed important. The length of this movie is just silly, I love slow movies and sat through this movie longer than I would have anyway because I liked that it was a different pacing than most Hollywood flicks. But by half way through I realised that this pacing does not work for this film, because there is not enough happening to keep us interested through the slow points. The characters are not highly complex, the drama isn't compelling, and neither is their relationship or any of the relationships around them. ",2012
1,"I am always leery of actors who want to take more control of their careers by either writing, directing or producing movies.

1,"This movie is strickly a 'by the numbers' date movie, the only problem is a lack of comedy. Considering the cast, it should have had some moments, but the lack of any real funny gags, or joke is surprising. The only thing I can think of is they cut out a lot to avoid a NC-17 rating, so it might be interesting to eventually see an unrated version, but I doubt the result would change things that much. I would consider this movie more of a drama than a comedy, because it deals with the reality of moving from one city to another, and the fact that you may think you have a career, it all really depends on the time and place. If they marketed the movie as a drama, I would have not expected to be amused, but the whole campaign is centred around the laughs surrounding an engagement, but there is nothing funny about frostbite, and amputation of body parts. It is starting to look like Jason Segal isn't as funny as everyone thought, and as he gets older, he will be less and less funny, who really wants to watch someone in their 40s act like a teenager, because he is funny now, sometimes, doing that kind of comedy, but this movie demonstrates that is the only comedy he is successful at.

A few funny moments, but problems of both pacing and tone are fatal, as are the silly Brit stereotypes, the silly Jewish stereotypes, the silly ""clueless straight guy"" stereotypes. Jason Segal is, at times, so unbearably unattractive – both physically and as a character – that the whole ""love of her life"" angle turns into more disbelief than any normal person can suspend without hydraulic help. In the end, what the film has to say about relationships is a lot of galling treacle.

In a reasonable sized screening I didn't hear one person actually laugh, the odd titter - that was it. What resounded was the awkwardness everyone felt watching this 'comedy' just fail in every way. We were all sat there in horror as joke after joke fell flat on its face. Mind you, so unbelievably bad as it was, it was spell-binding in its awkwardness. I think Emily Blunt generally is a great actress, but she does not have comic timing. You'd think Jason Segel couldn't go wrong, but even he couldn't pull off the ""jokes"" that this film was rammed with. I would literally rather pull my own fingernails off than have to watch this painfully misguided comedy again. Who on earth wrote that script?

This is considered a romantic COMEDY? Ridiculous! It's a raunchy comedy, but any respect for the sanctity of marriage is completely thrown by the wayside here. Scenes showing male depression, a professor hitting on a student, people of Asian descent (as well as elderly parents) using the ""f"" word on each other, black racial stereotypes, the state of Michigan portrayed the worst it's ever been, frostbite injury seen as humorous (it is not), someone getting shot with an arrow, children watching their mother and aunt cursing right in front of them while imitating childhood TV characters, a woman demeaning a man's sexuality, all of this is just totally unfunny. I'm only 52 but as I watched this I felt very sad that the audience in my theater just laughed at every dysfunctional, pathetic joke. Is this what the idea of marriage has fallen to amongst people in their 20s and 30s? I also found myself wondering how long it would be until this excuse for a movie ended, finally walking out - couldn't take any more. Has our society fallen this far? I thank God that I am naive to this kind of trash! I will never watch another movie starring Jason Segal, and that includes ""How I Met Your Mother"" as well.",2012

7,"You may recall a major hit a few years ago entitled KNOCKED UP by Director Judd Apatow. You may also remember the ""other"" couple in that film, the secondary characters, the characters that the main characters ""played against"" for dramatic exposition. Well, Director Apatow, for reasons that are less than clear, decided to not only do a follow=up film to that hit, but to base said film on the second couple, the couple most viewers who saw the first film have likely forgotten. Wait, it gets better. The actress who played the wife in the original film (ie, in the ""second"" couple) is Leslie Mann, who, by coincidence, is Apatow's wife in real life. And, ergo, the star of the current film. See? And -- if you like coincidences, you will love this -- Mann herself turned 40 years old the same year that this film was made. So -- let's sum up for those of you having trouble with all this, which should be most of you -- Apatow took the secondary characters from a hit film and made a brand new film about middle aged married people, casting his very own wife. In other words, he decided to do a film about his own marriage. The reviewers have so far been less than kind about his film -- one major reviewer suggesting that all the characters are so horrible he wanted to sell the bunch of them to white slavers -- but one suspects Apatow could care less. This is the film he wanted to make and he made it. Deal with it. Comments... * if you are married, you will ""get"" a lot of the set pieces in the film. If you are not, you won't. In fact if you are not married, this film may possibly damage you for actual marriage, and should be avoided simply on the grounds of public policy. * Leslie Mann is one of the most photogenic actresses in Hollywood and under different circumstances probably deserved an entire film of her own, just like this one. In fact, she steals entire scenes from Meghan Fox. However, all things considered, these are NOT those circumstances... * overall a forgettable film. Unless you actually are Judd Apatow",2014
5,I think I know my issue with Judd Apatow's movies.,2012
2,"I just sat through ""This is 40"" , and I think they should rename it ""This is Pointless"". This self indulgent , sloppy , lazy , whiny excuse for a movie should have never seen the light of day , and to think it made nearly $80 million at the box office is an embarrassment to people who have any taste for good filmmaking. While I have enjoyed some of the previous films of Judd Apatow, It seemed the studio had so much confidence in his previous track record that they just gave him a bunch of money and said ""Do whatever you want"" , and that's what he did , and that's what we got. The enormous waste of talents like Paul Rudd , Albert Brooks , John Lithgow , etc. , is glaring , and I was just waiting for something, anything to happen in the movie to break up the monotony. The use of Apatows two daughters , non actors they are , was as annoying as the obvious lack of a script , and the fact that a lot of the movie seemed to be ad libbed , and really had nowhere to go, and basically wasn't the least bit interesting , or funny , just annoying. The movie went on and on for over two hours , weaving it's little plot of this annoying, self absorbed little family , the plot was about How Paul Rudds' record label was struggling , how Leslie Mann , playing his wife, ran a store which was losing money from a possible thieving employee , and how their daughters were driving them crazy with their daily demands. All in all , I had to go ""Who the hell cares?"" These self absorbed , totally unlikeable , totally unbelievable characters had nothing to say , nowhere to go , and nothing to do. If I'm ever going to see another Apatow project , I hope he gets his head out of his butt, and can make a movie with interesting characters and situations, instead of the loathsome , uninteresting characters and storyline that go nowhere, which is what this movie is.",2013
3,"I am 39, so I could relate to this movie. There were many fun ""lines"" but they way they were delivered falls flat. Instead of being funny and showing us relevant insights to turning 40 and life, all this movie demonstrates is a depressing view of angry bitter people who hate each other. Scenes were just thrown together, stitched up and made into a movie. The beginning of the movie shows you that both their birthdays are close together (weeks), but the movie implies that a lot of time has past. What was that bit about them going away? I'm sorry, but if you are so broke you have to sell your house, you would not run off for the weekend. They were all happy and stoned, then what happened to that? I guess they needed something funny to show in previews. And I was thinking wasn't it his birthday party? There were many funny parts, but in between I was thinking, I'm bored and want to leave. Too bad. This movie made me angry, depressed and wanting to run as far away from these people as possible. The only really good part was during the credits when Melissa McCarthy has a bit from their outtakes.",2012
7,"Wow, this film seems to be generating a lot of hostility: I am not quite sure what's behind it. I guess people went into this expecting a sitcom-like, snappy feel good film, like 40 Year Old Virgin? Or goofy, happy-go-lucky characters such as Seth Rogen's posse in Knocked Up? Did these people not see Funny People? I am all in favor of letting Mr. Apatow develop as a director. To be clear here: this film follows Pete and Debbie's story arc from a few years after the events in Knocked Up. The are both turning 40, and neither is handling it particularly gracefully, but they weren't handling their lives and relationships particularly well in the earlier film. I found this movie to have a Larry David Show quality to it: however irrationally and offensively our protagonists behave, there are always others who will go them one better (or worse). Yes, Debbie and Pete are defective human beings; but so, I would argue, are all the people inhabiting this world, excepting the very gentlemanly Graham Parker (and Billie Joe Armstrong). Such is the stuff of comedy. Are these caricatures? Surely, and yet they are caricatures of realities which I see every day. Is the teenage daughter given to histrionics? You bet, but that is what teenagers are like, and the fact remains that teenagers turn their parents into equally irrational and histrionic characters in that relationship; I actually found it refreshing to find a teenager in a movie, played by a teenager, who isn't a wisecracking savant commenting on the follies of her elders.",2013
2,"The movie sets up the perfect situation for a triumphant turn around, but instead of the happy ending expected of a comedy it digs a deeper, darker, more depressing hole. Yet it's characters are compelling. The story was just horrible. This ended up wasting even more of my time. If you are thinking of watching this movie as a comedy don't. It is a drama and was wrongly recommended to me. It was so bad with such bland dialogue that I decided to make an account and come warn people during the film.",2014
6,"First and foremost, this is the first movie I have seen in years that actually has something to do with my life. I read through the threads, and I wasn't surprised that people found it depressing. They were probably expecting to see Knocked Up or I Love You Man. It lacks the stoner cool single guys being all zany about porn. Instead the comedy comes from things that forty somethings deal with: mortgage, kids, hormones, diet, expectations, etc. I rarely get to see a movie about people my age or having problems and solutions that don't involve guns, drugs, superheroes, cartoon birds, and people who have 8 figure life styles without ever having a job. Okay, so he's a groovy record co. guy, and she has a chic boutique.... Definitely way more California than my life, but still it is pretty real to life. I will concede that there are some gags that don't quite work, but like I said: I'm stickin' up for this one because I think it is getting a bad rap based on expectations. Thanks to Judd Apatow for making a movie about life instead of (hip jobs aside) hyper-situational life.",2013
9,"Wasn't expecting much before watching the movie, but was pleasantly surprised. Firstly and most importantly the comedy was not lame. The jokes were down to earth, made sense and made me laugh sincerely. This rarely happens with all those stupid comedies nowadays. Secondly - the topic and the storyline was so relevant in regards to relationships and families of our society. Though it is a comedy genre - but underneath that you can fell that the problems and situations that are being touched are important and worth thinking about. The performances by Paul Rudd, Leslie Mann and Maude Apatow - were amazing. Paul and Leslie were perfect, but also my respects to the youngest cast members, as they were convincing and did their part flawlessly.",2012

1,"This movie is truly the most awful movie I seen for the past year or so. Complete and utter disjointed mess that's going nowhere. I am not even sure what I am watching, characters just do whatever that doesn't seem to contribute anything to the plot in any way.",2013
2,"I just saw this movie last night. I was a fan of Knocked up even though my wife and I fought like cats and dogs after the movie (it was about having kids. This time around, the movie did only one thing for me, it made me thankful for my family. Leslie Mann's character was even more of a raving bitch than in Knocked up. I told my wife that I would have shoved her head in the toilet when she was trying to inspect it to see if Paul Rudd's character was really taking a crap or just avoiding her. He was probably defecating on paper so he could help make this film. Actually only Paul Rudd really brought anything to the picture unless you count Megan Fox as a hot boutique worker. The film showcases a small part of the miserable lives of Pete and Debbie as they spiral into unhappiness and misery. Into the mix are thrown several more characters who are equally miserable. I was looking forward to this movie big time and when I realized that it was going south I couldn't wait for it to be over. Unfortunately its over two hours long. So, if you are looking for a way to spend a few hours in the dark, lock your self in a closet or just close your eyes but do not go see this film--it sucked!",2012
7,"Pete (Paul Rudd) is a family man married with Debbie (Leslie Mann) and they have two daughters, the teenager Sadie (Maude Apatow) and the girl Charlotte (Iris Apatow). Paul and Debbie, who lies about her age, are turning 40 and they are planning a party for Paul. He lost his job in Sony and now he has a nostalgic record label with only one artist, the British rock singer and songwriter Graham Parker that was successful in the period from the 60's to the 80's. Debbie has a fashion store with two employees, and she has just found an embezzlement of US$ 12,000.00. She was poisoned by the inefficient Jodi (Charlyne Yi) and suspects of the productive saleswoman Desi (Megan Fox). ",2013
8,"Judd Apatow is undoubtedly directly at the centre of the USA's comedy universe. Discovering and nurturing stars such as Seth Rogen, Jason Segel and Jonah Hill, and with movies like Superbad, Bridesmaids and Anchorman to his name, Apatow has earned the power to make movies about anything he wants, starring whoever he wants. And so we have This is 40, the fourth film that he has written, directed and produced (after The 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up and the far weaker Funny People). Starring his wife, Leslie Mann and two kids, Maude and Iris, and filmed on the Apatow's street, this is bordering on autobiographical- even Judd's 90 year old grandmother makes an appearance. ",2013
1,"""Marketed as a comedy this is film just try's to be a moving drama about a very unlikeable couple that make no sense about the actions they do and the conclusion of the film made no sense to what the aim of the film was"" ",2012
5,When first seeing the trailers for this movie i was excited because i remember this couple's story in Knocked Up and it was hilarious but i think that's as far as it should've gone and i'll tell you why.,2012
1,This was one of the worst films I have seen of any genre of movies in a long time. There was little to know story line. It seems the entire film was one giant fight between an incompatible married couple. There was absolutely no point to this movie. And for a comedy/drama- there wasn't even one funny scene. ,2013
1,"I believe I have seen all of Judd Apatow's films and I've liked a majority of them but This Is 40 is not only his worst film, it's one of the worst films I've seen this year if not ever. The film honestly felt like the script was never completed, an editor was never hired and the actors had no direction. It had none of the joy of his other films and not even the natural likability of the stars (Rudd, Mann, Segel) could save it. It felt dour and depressing all while under the naturally (or unnaturally) pleasant skies of Santa Monica.",2012
3,"When I first saw the trailer for the movie, I thought that it would be an cute, funny movie to watch. Unfortunately, it was anything but. This movie portrays a middle aged woman(Leslie Mann) who is in denial of her age. This movie perpetuates this society's constant obsession with looks & age... what happened to aging gracefully?!(What message does this send to viewers...) She's obsessed with how she looks like and tries to act like a 20 year old. She has a very irritating voice, it's very high pitched & she sounds like she is a 15 year old girl!! Not a great actress either. The adults in this movie act like immature;children & get away with their childish antics. Its not really funny. All the funny parts are in the trailer anyways. ALSO, is it just me or does Megan Fox always play the hot/dumb girl in all her roles! Why doesn't she take on a role of an independent woman, someone that would actually be a good role model for young girls! Anyways, the characterizations of the women in this movie are terrible representations of how women should be like (submissive to their husbands/ needing to look ""hot"" to get a man). Don't watch. awful movie",2012
4,"Debbie (Leslie Mann) and Pete (Paul Rudd) are both homing in on 40, a breakthrough age, where youth is now firmly behind us, highlighted by their elder teenage daughter Sadie (Maude Apatow) going through her puberty. Far from a dysfunctional family nonetheless Debbie and Pete struggle to rekindle the attachment and mutual fulfillment that this marriage has brought forth. Pete is a loving father, despite the fact that Sadie was never planned, he affectionately tries to perform his duties, even if his love for rock music places him as somewhat of a family outsider. Coupled with his ailing music label, dedicated to the old timer music lovers, Pete is increasingly left alone.",2014
1,"I have an unhealthy fascination with how much I despise This is 40, a grinding, poorly paced, two and a half hour movie with editing that featured many scenes ending halfway through unresolved conversations; conversations that were repetitively depressing and unrealistic, accompanied with failed attempts of forced comic relief between the tearful lines of hatred and depression. What does that mean? Well, for example, our main couple might be and screaming through tears about things like how they hate their lives and lie to each other religiously, but then the film will have Paul Rudd yell ""We're like Simon and Garfunkel, and somehow, you turned me into Garfunkel!"" to which Leslie Mann eventually responds, ""What's wrong with Art Garfunkel, he has a beautiful voice!"" Oh, sorry, we're supposed to be in the mood to laugh now? Wait, no we're not, because now Paul Rudd whispers that she doesn't look at him with loving eyes like she looks at their daughters. Anecdotal evidence is not enough to condemn a movie, but this is the tip of the iceberg. Every scene has an identity crisis, trying to be funny and painful at the same time without any rhythm, flow, or pacing.",2013
2,"This movie got 1 laugh out of me other than that the movie was boring, doomed from the start, there was no point 2 the movie other than a psycho family with way 2 many problems, & the same words, gags, get repeated over & over again, the whole time i was watching it i thought ""is this movie over with so i can get back on with my life"" out of any movies or TV shows i have ever scene in my life i don't remember any of them boring me this bad weather i liked it or not, well i lied there is 50/50, Hop, & the Lorax, those movies i either almost fell asleep 2 or i wanted 2 shoot myself in the head, if some 1 tells u 2 watch this movie don't i learned that out the hard way, 133 minutes of my life wasted, if u wanna watch something that has family problems that's good watch we bought a zoo that may b a family movie but it's 100,000 times better than this, & another thing if the man characters dad has 4 or 5 sons, & he has 3 daughters i would say he really dodged that bullet that is some like if u want daughters over a son like me, well i don't have anything else 2 say on this dumb movie",2013
1,"I really had high hopes for this movie. Especially after seeing the trailers. Well, if you saw the trailer, that's exactly all the ""funny"" this movie has to offer... Literally... Out of 2+ hr movie, they fit all the amusing parts in the 2min trailer for it. I could not finish the movie. Walked out of the theater after getting my money back. I'm in my mid 30's and I found the main characters (including the kids) to be self centered, annoying, and most of all depressing. The title of the movie should not be ""This is 40"". It should be ""This is 18"", because the language, the ""acting"", the situation ""humor"" would only appeal to that age group... I cannot stress enough how painfully awful this way too long movie is... This should have never made it into a production. If anything, is should of been a one time Saturday Night Life skid. It would probably be fine as that... Nothing more... Do not waste 2hrs of your life on this emotionless drain on your brain... Worst movie of 2013 for me so far.....",2013
3,"This film was excruciating. By the end of the film, I was so exhausted after having watched a staggeringly annoying family (and almost everyone associated with said family) argue, scream, yell, whine, cry, complain and fight for TWO HOURS that I was on the verge of suicide. I popped in a DVD copy of ""Requiem For a Dream"" just to cheer myself up.",2013
5,"This is not a film that you are going to watch multiple times. Even for the first time, I had some difficulties. Sometimes felt like suffocating, and asking myself again and again: What is the point of this movie??",2013
10,"Great movies have the power to make you think and this movie had me thinking for so long I couldn't sleep on the night I saw it. It is a tremendous film with a deeply unsettling message and even now, 24 hours after seeing it I am haunted by the end.",2013
10,"I still can not describe my state of mind at the end of the film, a mixture of devastating feelings that left me breathless, a state of mind that only the greatest movies are able to leave, and this is one of those movies ! Inside there is so much stuff to talk about that in a comment like this is highly simplistic! If you love art, psychology, suspense, love stories, in short, if you love life, this movie will surprise you. A great cast of characters and works of art (TONS!) complete the work and make it an unmissable, different from all the other great movies of Tornatore. Beware then by those who want to associate this film with a film of Hitchcock because it means dismantle and destroy the film, this film is much more! Thrilling is only one small part of a masterpiece of international cinema! Absolutely a must see!",2013
10,"This is, by far, my most favorite movie of this year! I've always been a Geoffrey Rush fan, but in this movie, I've seen a very special Rush who, by the way his on screen persona goes thru a life changing metamorphosis, creates a real, day-to-day living among us man with real life personal fears, heartbreaking disillusions and self rediscovering. He makes us care for the very rigid and robotic Virgil Oldman in a way that surprises the senses. He is, in the beginning, a character who most people would find repelling by his uncomfortable attitude and bossy ways. But, as the movie proceeds, he is changed by this peculiar and frightful young woman who has a way of bringing him up, and crushing him down within minutes in their dialog. I must say that director Tornatore wrote this amazingly beautiful story with a golden pencil, I'm sure. This is not another love story. It's a life story, set in the world of Arts, where there's more to discover behind the colors of paintings and the still faces of sculptures than meets the eye. As the movie comes to an end, you will face a difficult task: to be thankful that such a story made it to the big screen, or to desire that it would've remain only in the writer's mind and heart. I give it a full 10, with no regrets. Awaiting more from Tornatore-Rush team! They get along pretty well I see.",2013
8,"The only Guiseppe Tornatore film I've seen is Cinema Paradiso which is an absolute masterpiece. It surprises me that he was only in his early 30s when he directed it as the film already showed the work of an expert, given that his other films aren't as notable. The Best Offer, with its tight screenplay, lush sets, brilliant performance by Geoffrey Rush and beautiful score by Ennio Morricone, also exemplifies the sophisticated expertise filmmaking. It's refreshing to see a film with a unique universe grounded in the culture of our own with some bizarrely specific themes. While my only complaint is that the dialogue has this very ""written"" quality about it that is near impossible to deliver in a natural way, it's at least consistent throughout.",2013

I dare to call it ""another"" just because his performance in the King's Speech was quite impressive... The movie offers not only an interesting script, somehow near to Agatha's Christie novels, but also fine images and an inspired music. If you like fine paintings and antique furniture, you will enjoy watching this movie, even without paying to much attention to the criminal skeleton that leads the story...there is no place for useless sequences, everything goes smoothly and natural, the drama is well tempered until the very final peak, the whole is well balanced and wonderful. I do not know anything about the director of this movie, Mr.Giuseppe Tornatore, but, I am pretty sure that he has many other things to say in his future career...be sure to not miss this film, you will highly enjoy the time spent watching it!",2013
10,"I watched 12 most promising movies at recent Berlinale, and this was ultimately the best one. The movie is breathtaking and captures you from the first seconds. Mr. Rush acting is superb, as are the art direction, cinematography, score and of course, the plot. Film is full of beauty, emotion and humor. It feels like a united whole from beginning to the end and leaves a great impression. I was also surprised later, when I found out that it was shot digitally with Arri Alexa Studio - I was sure it was shot on film. This really is a camera which will finally kill film, although I love film so much. Ironically, film may remain the medium of choice for low budget productions, who can not afford renting this Arri beast.",2013

10,This movie is about Art!,2013
8,"Geoffrey Rush's layered, dominant performance is the thematic and emotional crux of this very dense but mesmerising thriller. In one of his best performances, he plays his character Virgil Oldman with theatrical notes, making the auctioneer an impatient and callous man, who is suffering from rhypophobia. His antisocial behaviour and general disregard of other people signposts this as being a story about a man who learns to reconnect with people and to become a better person. Throughout the film Virgil does attempt to reconnect with the world by aiding an unseen woman named Claire (Sylvia Hoeks), who communicates with him through a wall as he helps her value the property of family belongings. This is a mere starting point as the rabbit hole of the narrative is far deeper.",2013
8,"it is a good film. good acting, good directing, good story, good music... it's not the best i've seen recently (i just saw 'the hunt' from thomas vinterberg and that blew me off completely), but it is worth watching.",2013
4,"The cast and creative team endow this film with the promise of greatness. And indeed, for the first 15 minutes or so, the crisp cinematography, coupled with Rush's authoritative characterization, keep this promise firmly viable. In the first instance we have an endearingly dour, (refreshingly heterosexual) dandy of an art and antiques dealer, who likes to dabble in a little illicit personal procurement every now and then.",2013

A whizz-kid helps the auctioneer on technical matters, including putting back together an automaton pieces of which mysteriously appear out of nowhere, on the floor, in various rooms in the villa. Many other sub-plots emerge, no doubt in order to give complexity and subtlety to the plot, and lead the viewer off on wrong conclusions, all the better to be absolutely amazed when the truth comes to light.",2013
6,"The con-film has become a staple of cinema: so much so, that it's almost impossible for a film's makers to retain the element of surprise. One solution is to layer con-upon-con, with a sense of knowningness deliberately induced in the audience: we're encouraged to think that something is happening that hasn't yet been revealed, even if we're not sure what. But 'The Best Offer' takes a simpler route: a man explores a path through life that ultimately turns out to be fake. In one sense, there are very few tricks in this plot, just a mirage. But the film needs to give us two things for this to work: firstly, a plausible emotional journey for the victim, and secondly, a sense of motivation for those who plan to rob him. Yet the film's Gothic story is never remotely plausible: it's entertaining as fable, but there's no chance of us being fooled along with the character; or if there is, it's only because we consciously suspend our disbelief as the necessary price of continuing to watch. As for motive, it's simply to steal the money, which is plausible, but dull (compare Bielisnky's marvellous 'Nine Queens' to see a more believable, internally motivated, and cleverer story which nonetheless ends in a similar denouement). The set designer must have had fun on this movie: the story as a whole is jolly but shallow, and it's more of a disappointment than a joy when it's Gothic accoutrements are revealed as sideshow to a fundamentally duller story.",2013
5,This review has spoilers pretty early on.,2014
9,"What a superb movie! Went to the movies today with little expectations, other than I would be seeing something 'classier' than the normal fare. The movie started off nicely with Geoffrey Rush dominating the screen with his larger than life character, not particularly to my liking. However, as the story unfolded and the plot deepened the subtle changes transforming him into an image of one his finer works of art, I found myself mesmerised and transported into his world. The complexity of the plot developed nicely and my suspensions were aroused reasonably early. However, I didn't mind at all - for the journey was beautiful. The acting, cinematography, music, script - and beautiful artwork and scenery - certainly compensated for any flaws the movie had. Some may say it was predictable and flawed in parts, but hey, enjoy the experience and immerse yourself in fantasy - this is a movie after all. I find myself still puzzling over some aspects of the plot - the real Clair, what's going on there. I also would have thought that Lambert would have had good reason to be complicit with the others. Gem of a movie - I can't wait to see it again.",2013
10,"The Best Offer, is officially my first review. It is, in my opinion, one of the most brilliant movies, from beginning to end, an absolute masterpiece! The overall theme is old, filmed a million times, and absolutely choked to death. However, this is a dramatic twist, with epic scenic displays of stunning art, psychological battles through life (accomplishments/missed opportunities), Materialism vs Human relationships. Anyone who is mature, evolved, can read between the lines, will thoroughly enjoy this movie... The acting, the script, macro/micro details, absolutely ingenuous. For those of you who have a negative opinion of this movie... I must question you maturity? Among a list of other ailments, surely your cursed. I'm sorry, time for you to grow up, and give credit where it is due. In the end, if you consider yourself well read, thoughtful, abstract, do yourself a favor and watch this one--- 10 out of 10.",2015

7,"The first English language feature film from director Giuseppe Tornatore, best known for his marvelous homage to film with Cinema Paradisio, is a strange mix of drama, psychological suspense and romance. It tells the story of Virgil Oldham (played by Geoffrey Rush), an eccentric and unscrupulous art auctioneer who has a scam going with his long time partner in crime Billy (an underused Donald Sutherland). Oldham is able to easily spot fakes, but he also has an eye for deceiving desperate sellers regarding the worth of their forgotten masterpieces. Oldham is vain, cynical, fastidious and emotionally dry, until he is asked to evaluate the furniture of a house being sold. The house belongs to the reclusive, agoraphobic Claire (Dutch actress Sylvia Hoeks), who has shut herself off from the world and refuses to emerge from a secret room within the house. Oldham finds himself drawn to help Claire overcome her phobia. The Best Offer moves at a slow, measured pace that slowly draws the audience into its world of deception. Just when we think we have it all figured out, Tornatore manages to pull the rug from under our feet. This is one of those films that almost demands to be seen twice so that you can unravel the puzzle and put the various pieces together. The film has been gorgeously shot on location in Italy, Prague and Vienna by cinematographer Fabio Zamarion (Respiro, etc), and the lush score by Tornatore's regular collaborator Ennio Morricone adds to the atmosphere. Rush delivers a strong performance as a cold and unsympathetic character. Sutherland sleepwalks his way through an undemanding role, while Jim Sturgess is solid as a gifted young mechanic who can fix old clockwork pieces.",2013

9,"With his latest movie, ""Life of Pi"", Ang Lee further establishes himself as one of the greatest contemporary movie directors. Starting from his Taiwanese beginnings, and his highly enjoyable, family-harmonizing ""Father Knows Best"" trilogy (1992-1994), through his Academy Award winning works on gracefully choreographed, highly spiritualized Far East martial arts tour de force ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" (2000, best foreign-language film) and on an uncommon yet nostalgic portrayal of the Old West in ""Brokeback Mountain"" (2005, best director), to his other titles like ""Sense and Sensibility"" (1995), ""The Ice Storm"" (1997), and ""Lust, Caution"" (2007), quality and Kubrick-like versatility shown in his movies offer continuous attraction for wide audience of his admirers.",2013
10,"Few movies will leave a lasting impression on you..Life of Pi is one of those. Not even a single moment is dull, in fact the story is woven so tightly that you never realize that the script is so simple. It is beautifully directed and kudos to Ang Lee, not only was he able to capture the beauty of India, he was also able to get the best of the actors. Though it does not rank too high on 3D, its just visually mesmerizing. My trust and faith in Ang Lee has gone up to the highest level after watching this movie..Luckily I was able to catch the premiere show and will continue to relish the after effects of the movie for the next few days!",2012
9,"Ang lee's life of pi is an adaptation of a 'Man booker prize winner' novel by the same name, written by Yann Martel. It's a story set in the late seventies of an Indian teenager (Pi Patel) who is stranded on a life boat in the pacific. What distinguishes this tale of survival from the rest is that the author dishes out a delicious slice of creativity in giving the castaway, a tiger for a companion. Yes, like the posters and trailers have you believe, there is a boat on which a man and a tiger have to live! This makes 'life of pi' not only a story of human struggle against nature but also a profound tale that questions 'what separates man from beast?'. More interestingly, 'when does man become a beast'? ",2012
9,"Just finished watching the Midnight Premiere. Did not disappoint one bit. The Acting is incredibly believable, and the ending ties it all together. The story sorta drags in the beginning, but Ang Lee did a good job keeping my attention to the film. The Animation is incredibly realistic. I couldn't tell the difference between what was real and what wasn't. Not one moment did I doze off. Definitely worth 127 minutes of your life. Ang Lee, you did an outstanding job. To the Cast, you all did excellent. I am very satisfied! Although there were a lot of pros, there were some cons. At one point the Format of the Film switched from 16:9 to 4:3, but that might have been the projector at the Cinemark I attended. I also noticed some of the animations of animals started to go off screen and you could see the animated objects in the black area of the Wide Screen part (I'm assuming that was for the 3D, but I watched it in 2D so it looked sketchy). But it's minor. An average viewer won't even notice it, I'm an aspiring filmmaker, and I notice the little things!! I enjoyed the film, and you will too. 9/10. Worth it.",2012

The shipwreck scene at sea is only somewhat believable, if you allow yourself to be distracted by the CGI, but it drags, and the references to religion are just a mish-mash of ancient superstition that don't mesh well with the supposed story being told.

The thing with this magic however, is that it won't leave you for quite a long while and it might even make you question your most core beliefs. Or the lack of them.",2012

You can bet the film's main character feels the exact same way.,2012
1,I'm going to go ahead and say it outright. This film flat out takes the cake for the most overrated film of the year. This is unwarranted and uninspired Oscar bate on a Hurt Locker level. For the first time in a very long time I have actually left a movie feeling I had wasted my money.,2013

The 3D effects are some of the best ever seen and feels absolutely necessary in a film so heavy handed with religious tones. What Mychael Danna achieves in Lee's film has just placed him in the forefront of great film composers working today. He continues to impress with his musical range, envelopes the film's message and thematic narrative in somber and beautiful melodic notes. On Visual Effects alone, Life of Pi will likely land a nomination for Best Picture. What Lee invents with the ocean and the integration of the tiger and the other animals is spectacular. He allows the mood of the film and the imagery to marry each other in a ceremonial experience that stands next to Sci-Fi epics like Avatar (2009) and Hugo (2011).",2012
3,"I need to forewarn that I went into this movie with high expectations due to the critical review from the industry and the public, and the expectations grew even more after Pi said his story would make his friend, (and by extension me) believe in God. The CGI landscapes, seascapes were beautiful, but the CGI people were not as they looked odd, almost demonic. Still, I was really intrigued now that Pi was claiming that his story would leave me no choice but believe in God, so I kept watching.",2013

9,"I saw Mirror Mirror in theaters back in April with my niece, but I just decided to write something on it because it has come under a lot of criticism and honestly I don't know why.I saw a lot of negativity on YouTube and many other places so it got me to thinking what really is the problem with movies geared more toward children? ",2012
8,"I took my 11 yr old niece to see this movie and we both loved it. Good clean family fun. Nice to walk out of a movie singing and dancing for a change...... Julia Roberts is hilarious, Nathan Lane even more so and the rest of the cast endearing. Seems if a movie doesn't have violence or sex, not many like it. That is so sad.... life should be fun sometimes and this movie made us feel uplifted and happy.",2012
8,"OK - so this is a major re-working of Snow White and in fact you could say that it is an entirely different story...bar the principle character names. But to read some of the comments here would be to be mis-led in the extreme in my terribly humble opinion. Not being a huge Ms Roberts fan I was unsure as to how I would react to her as a dominant player in fable setting - but she was capable and trod a fine line between villainy and comedy that worked. Of the other characters - as has been noted Snow White stole the show and was a capable lead and will doubtless go on to far grander things. But the actors delivering the Dwarf story-line were also in keeping with the piece - OK not hugely polished but capable of delivering in the contexts of fantasy. But the real reason for leaving this review is really because of my kids - they loved it. They were scared, amused, excited and involved throughout the film and left having sat through the credit dance sequence first. And frankly it is a film aimed more at them than most reviewers here. So let's not be too sniffy about ""truth"" or ""thespianism"" or indeed ""realism"" - this is a young persons film and looked great, didn't patronise them and had some great ideas brought to life - not always successfully but with a touch of humour and imagination so in my book it's a winner and not to be judged too harshly.",2012
10,First off: See this with a good set of friends. Half of the charm for me was turning to my best friends and seeing the look of horror on their faces when they realized what I had dragged them to. Here are the reasons I like this:,2012
9,"I walked into this movie expecting another ""fairy tale"" movie. So I was pleasantly surprised when the plot took a turn for the unexpected. I loved how the writers used adult humor to keep audience attention. In addition, the graphics were surprisingly creative; especially when it came to the 7 dwarfs. I didn't feel like I was watching an old fable play out on the big screen. Instead, I felt that I was being told the story of Snow White for the very first time. I would recommend this movie to anyone with a sense of humor, and an appreciation for creative graphics. If you think you are going to fall asleep in this movie, think again! Mirror Mirror is a great tale for all.",2012
7,"I was really interested in seeing this movie from the start, but the negative press and the corny trailer made me lower my expectations somewhat. There was something about it, though, that still made me want to go see it, even if it turned out to be good for nothing except eye candy. However, my initial skepticism went right out the window at the stunning opening sequence, recounting the prologue in animation that was part puppet theater, part illustration.",2012
8,"I went to IMDb to read reviews of this movie before seeing it. What I read was not too encouraging so I had fairly low expectations. Boy, was I surprised to find myself smiling throughout the film while my daughter and I nudged each other to comment on how much we liked it! Julie Roberts and Nathan Lane make a stellar duo, and every role was so well cast. Conceptually, I was thrilled with the visuals, the costuming and computer animated sets and special effects. Any changes made to the original story were in my opinion quite clever. The surprise Bollywood number at the end cinched it for me! Take your family to see this movie!",2012
8,"In this variation on the Snow White story, most of the familiar elements are in place, augmented by the dwarfs being robbers, and the Wicked Queen having designs on the Prince (with a view to topping up the old Exchequer).",2012
7,"After reading some of the negative reviews, I pretty much did not expect much out of this movie. While this is indeed a rather boring movie for adults, I did enjoy the show more than I had expected.",2012
9,I absolutely loved this movie and everyone in the theater was clapping at the end. I do not believe that I have seen a standing ovation before in a movie theater that didn't have a live performance. It was humorous and dramatic and silly and I just loved it! Julia Roberts was devious and cunning with a wacky edge to her part! Lilly Collins is absolutely gorgeous just as I imagined Snow White should look. The Prince's demise was hysterical and the dwarfs were the perfect touch to this version of Snow White. I liked this version better than the Disney movie! Mirror Mirror was absolutely entertaining! I WILL BUY THIS ONE WHEN IT COMES OUT ON DVD or BLU-RAY!,2012
7,"Mirror, Mirror does not deserve so bad ratings. I've seen worse movies last year with so bad direction, bad screenplay, or bad acting, and people gone mad as they were watching the best movies ever. I really can't understand people's taste.",2012
4,"While this film seems to be perfectly tailored for some audiences, most discerning viewers will find Mirror Mirror to be lacking depth. Several plot fixtures are left unexplained, and in general this movie feels like the writers are trying to shove as many fantasy clichés into one movie as they can. The movie would undoubtedly have been better had the writers simply stuck to the original story, but they did not. The deviation from the classic story was not well done, and in many ways, it did not make much sense. ",2012
8,"My mom and I went and saw this movie today, pretty much for a girls day out and since Snow White has always been her favorite fairy tale we chose this movie to see. Over all it is definitely a good family movie. It really was great to see a strong female character that saved the prince instead of the princess being saved by the prince which is the tradition. And it was nice and different to see Prince Charming actually have a personality of sorts and not just...there like that 1937 Disney film had, not that that version was bad of course. ",2012
8,"Not only are comic book characters finding screen time in the cinemas, but fairy tale ones as well, with films such as Red Riding Hood going through a reinvention of the character, as does Snow White this year with no less than two big budgeted productions, each with its unique take on the character in what would be a face off between Lily Collins and Kristen Stewart in the title roles, one still very much that demure teenager, while the other going by the trailers happen to be more warrior princess instead.",2012
7,"Nobody is asking for another Snow White movie, but at some point, this one is interesting because it's directed by Tarsem Singh and you know his films always have quirky visuals and fascinating costumes. Nothing like any blockbusters out there. And these elements fit perfectly to the story of Snow White. As a result, it's enjoyable and amusing. Although it suffers a few missteps that aren't easy to ignore. But the merits are more noticeable than the flaws. It may be unnecessary but it's actually pretty good.",2012
7,"From the very start of the film, the audience can tell its in for a visual treat. ""Mirror Mirror"" opens with the queen giving the story background (which is shown by porcelain dolls; a very creative choice on the director's part). The film never lacks in taste or boring sets. From the town to the castle to the forest, stunning costumes and lavish sets abound. ",2012
8,"I don't know what movie everyone else went to, but I thought Mirror Mirror was fantastic. I was laughing throughout most of the movie, and I think that was the point. It's a fairy tale. It's not supposed to be taken seriously. The twisted fairy tale plot was entertaining and adorable. The idea of Snow White teaming up with a group of renegade dwarfs was hilarious. If anyone said they saw that coming (without the the help of a trailer) they were lying. I am a huge fan of Tenth Kingdom, so the similarities made me laugh. The ending was absolutely perfect. In every way. I didn't see the twist at the end until a few minutes before, but it still wasn't an ""oh, I totally saw that coming."" Also, I loved Snow's character development. There comes a time when you have to be your own hero and stand up for yourself and others. My sister and friend were a little weirded out by the dancing and singing at the end, but I thought it was great. A classic ending for a Bollywood romance film: a wedding and a dance. It was so funny. Definitely random, but funny. Overall, I really, really liked this movie. If you want a lighthearted story and a good laugh, this movie is for you. :)",2012
10,"Go see this movie. Frankly I don't get what the nay-sayers are complaining about. I studied film and literature at the university, and found this film to be one of the best family movies I've seen. I would own this in my collection. Stunning visuals complement a story line that twists along a very modern path in contrast to the old fairy tale. The story is told well. The acting is not award-winning but it is believable. Lily Collins (Snow White) is wonderful! And yes -- the outcome is a bit predictable for anyone who's ever heard of Snow White -- but wouldn't you expect that? My son (7) and daughter (9) both loved it, although some parts were scary enough to send my son cuddling up to me. We all left grateful for the experience. And, as usual, covered in popcorn. Go see it. And don't miss the dance scene after the end of the movie and before the credits. It's a trip watching the cast in 18th century French Royal costumes dancing and singing to a modern Indian beat, a fitting analogy to the film.",2012
7,"Just watched this fairy tale spoof of a movie with my movie theatre-working friend. Julia Roberts plays the Evil Queen who wants Snow White (Lilly Collins) killed but her henchman (Nathan Lane) is very reluctant to do so. Ms. White eventually falls in with some...well, let's just say diminutive warriors and a prince (Armie Hammer) who's being tricked into marrying the queen. What the queen does to make him fall for her is the most hilarious thing in the movie. Nothing is as funny as what I just mentioned but there's a fun atmosphere throughout even during the more intense dramatic parts. And check out the Bollywood number that ends the whole thing! Really, I'll just say that Mirror Mirror is very much worth a look.",2012
7,"MIRROR, MIRROR is one of two major Snow White movies coming out this year. The second one is SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN, which premieres in June. From the trailers the two movies look absolutely nothing alike. While I don't have any problems with a fairy tale princess taking levels in sheer awesome being a competent woman, I'm not sure if the grim and grittiness is the best way to do it. Why does a woman have to become grim and gritty to be badass? But this is neither here nor there. I have yet to see SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN because of an unfortunate lack of a time machine so I can't compare the two. (If I did have a time machine, I'd be going to see other movies, such as THE HOBBIT in December, among other worthwhile pursuits.)",2012
10,"""Mirror Mirror"" is in the top handful of my list for 2012 to date.",2012
10,"""Snow White"" reminded me of the ""Fractured Fairy Tales"" that were part of the old ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" cartoon show, where they put a modern and comedic twist on the old fairy tales. People who have a loyalty and affection for the original Snow White will not like this version (as shown by the other reviews on this movie). Julia Roberts was hilarious and evil as the Queen and she is the main reason I would see this movie again. I like the modern ""twists"" they put in, like Snow White saving the Prince, Snow White not eating the poison apple, Snow White carrying a sword and learning to be a warrior ""princess"" etc. made for a different and exciting new interpretation of this classic. Snow White was never boring and I could not keep my eyes off the screen, as I waited for another surprise in the storyline. I would say they were re-inventing the movie, making ""Fun"" of it(very brave)and having a ball, all the same time. Julia Roberts as the evil queen was funny and sarcastic all through the movie. Lily Collins started out slow but her acting ability got stronger and stronger as the movie progressed and Nathan Lane was a crack-up. So, go see ""Snow White"". You'll be glad you did.",2012
7,"I want to know, what is a model of Snow white's dagger. Someone tell me that he is a Bulgarian military pilot dirk from WWII. Why in the movie not make their own model. This dirk is Bulgarian historic weapon, i think. Otherwise, the movie is very nice, i enjoyed very much. Lily Collins is very beautiful in the role of Snow white, Julia Roberts makes a role that i don't expected, but i liked. The seven dwarfs is the same actors, like in most roles of dwarfs, but the idea of dwarf-giants was very fresh. Bollywood style final was very finny. Maybe watch the movie because friend told me about the pilots dirk from WWII, but i like the movie.",2012
6,"I can only think of one other movie where Julia Roberts is cast in a negative role. When news broke out that Roberts will play the evil queen in this Grimm's fairy tale adaptation, I just couldn't resist. Let's face it, it's not everyday you get to see the most popular actress in the world (with the best smile in Hollywood) play an evil and conniving character. In this version, the story remains true to original, if not with a wacky twist and a lot of humor. ",2012
1,"Mirror, Mirror is just Awful, Awful!! I am in shock and awe that this $100 million dollar fiasco was ever given the green light to be produced. The problems with this film are numerous; however, I will address some of the major issues. The first and foremost problem is CASTING!!!!! Call Julia Roberts lots of things, but you cannot call her WICKED or VAIN!!! The story of Snow White is the story in which the evil queen (Roberts) is so obsessed with beauty that she would spare not means to rid the kingdom of anyone thought to be any ""fairer"" than her. However, Roberts cannot pull off this role, every time she flashes her pearly white smile, she eludes wholesome and purity and not evilness nor malice in which the role requires. My second issue with the film is COSTUME Design. Yes, I understand that is film is supposed to be a fantasy/period piece;however, the costumes are so over the top; the kingdom seems to be one step shy of the ""KINGDOM of WHOVILLE"" from the movie ""The Grinch"". My third issue with the film would be SET design. While the costume design went over the top, the set design was sadly underwhelming. Every scene(except the forest set) seemed to be so minuscule and stuffed with extras that it looked tiny on the screen. The Kingdom looked like a 16x16 seedy alley way, while the ""Royal Wedding"" looked to be hosted in a Coleman pup tent!!! However, my number 1 issue with the film had to be director Tarsem Singh's vision. Was this film supposed to be a comedy, a fantasy, an adventure, or a Bollywood reincarnation of a beloved fairy tale... I have no idea; and after watching this film, neither did he. I know that Hollywood offers very little for the wholesome family audience to venture out to see; but it would be shameful for me to recommend this film, which I cannot. Save your money, this film with quickly end up in the Walmart Bargain Bin or the Walgreen Redbox $1 Rentals. P.S. Please do not get me started on the Cirque du Solei Dwarfs; and the Bollywood production number at the films end....... Enough Said! Please read more of my reviews at THE FARIS REEL on Facebook.",2012
2,"Ted is director Seth McFarlane's first feature film. Now, I think McFarlane is a funny guy. His massively popular TV show, Family Guy, was at one time the single funniest show on television. I am a true fan of McFarlane's brand of irreverent humor, but somehow, his first film is almost 100% devoid of laughs. ",2015
1,"I like Family Guy. So much, that I've always said that if I were stuck on a desert island, Seth MacFarlane is one of the people I'd want to be stuck there with me. I found this movie horrible, loathsome, and lazy, so much so that it actually made me question Family Guy. That's how bad I thought it was. It made me rethink my entire conception of humor. ",2012
8,"I really should start this with a warning: This film is not for everyone! If you are easily offended (by swearing, sexual references, casual racism and various stereotypes) then you should read no further and give this one a miss. However, if you are a fan of Seth MacFarlane's other projects (Family Guy, American Dad) and maybe you call yourself an ""80's child"" (so many pop culture references to this time) you are going to love this.",2012
2,"I came into this movie expecting to be laughing almost the whole time, but I sat through the movie almost bored out of my mind! I was on the verge of getting up and leaving but that would of been rude. So instead I sat through the almost unbearable part of the movie where Ted and John (Mark Wahlberg)have a big fight (surprise surprise) and John's girlfriend dumps him (another surprise -_-) it's just a barrage of clichés to be honest. The humour of the film was well below mediocre. I didn't understand some the jokes because they were referencing a celebrity that I have never heard about. The other jokes are about drugs, swearing and getting drunk. The only time I managed a laugh was when Ted was pretending to be a retard . All in all If you're American you'd probably understand and enjoy this movie more than I did. If not, stay away!",2012
1,"I just do not get it!!! This movie is just plain awful, and yet it is breaking box office records for ""R-rated"" comedies. With a running time of 98 mins, I could only manage to sit through the first 40 minutes before turning off this unfunny, quite boring, and quite disappointing film.",2012
2,"I have occasionally laughed out loud while my sons, ages 15 and 9, watch Family Guy, so I don't hate Seth MacFarlane.",2012
1,First of all let me tell you that I rate movies on a scale from -10 to 10 with 5 being the average and negative numbers for differentiating the awfulness of certain movies that are terrible.,2012
1,"I have a perverted sense of humor and do not mind Family Guy, so I'm not sure what I was expecting. But this nasty, pointless, unfunny drivel was a complete waste of my time and money. About the only thing achieved here is an effort to showcase Mila Kunis as completely gorgeous; on all other counts it is a fail - unless you like gratuitous eff words and references to bowel movements/flatulence/anal sex (oooohhh how shocking, and how boring)",2012
1,"This movie was such a piece of crap. Seth McFarlane should stick to what he knows best - cartoons, and leave the real movies to the big people. It was the same rehash of his series Family Guy with a horrible plot about this teddy bear growing up with his owner from childhood and gets... kidnapped? Kidnapped really?? And do we need yet another fat joke, or handicapped joke? If you answered yes, then you deserve to watch this film and lower your I.Q. another 20 points. Honestly, the only real treat was watching Mila Kunis, (and that's some damn fine acting by the way) they must have paid her a fortune to act in this crap. That goes for Mark Wahlberg too If you were expecting some magical, detailed plot where the jokes are actually funny and not recycled from a familiar series, then sorry to say look elsewhere.",2012
1,"I don't know how and why this movie was made. It's awful, plain awful. And most of all it's filled with stupid, vulgar jokes and references. I've seen bad movies before, but this one beats them by far. To make things worse, a grown up beats a boy and they make it look OK. A teddy bear is f.u... a girl and they make it look OK. The guy who has made this movie, Seth something is really deranged to make up a story like this. Stay away from this movie it's a complete waste of time. They talk about the superman movie at the end and they say it's not good? Let me tell you something: How about your movie a..h..o..l..e..s?",2012
6,"Whilst I did not dislike 'Ted' I cannot say I was overly impressed by it. The hype and popularity that built up towards the film's release had me expecting something fresh, something that would keep me laughing days after. To my disappointment, 'Ted', to me, turned out to just another Rom-Com, its only real unique twist being Ted himself. ",2012
4,"I came into this movie with high expectations. I have been a big fan of Family Guy for years now, and I couldn't wait to see this when it came out on DVD. I ended up paying about £14 for it when it came out (you can actually get it for about £5 now) and watched it straight after my purchase.",2013
1,"Folks, if you can't think of anything else but destroying a teddy bear as a result of a script-less 2h nonsense in which 2 idiots argue nonstop for unknown reasons, just quit making movies and go back working for McDonalds. The worst crock of manure I have ever seen in my whole life. Material for a 2 min short with a funny teddy. Oh crap, we don't have a long enough story for a film, let's say Mark and Mila keep fighting over nothing for 1 h. That covers up pretty much 80% of the time. Still not long enough? OK, the cute teddy bear dies, a sick maniac rips him in two =) how about that? Just perfect for children. Almost there with time? OK, teddy bear is revived =) What a great idea wow. The ultimate concept. I would like to catch the idiotic teen who wrote this moronic story and torture him for a couple of hours, just as he did to me. Stay away from this junk folks and overall don't let your kids watch it, it's stinky puke put together without ideas, no script, no nothing. Only a pinch of sadistic stupidity. Hate is everything that this smelly swill can produce.",2012
2,"Doesn't every child want their stuffed animals to come to life and talk? In fact, wasn't that the same idea which made Toy Story wildly successful? For a premise with endless potential, director/writer/actor Seth McFarlane does not deliver a story worth watching once, let alone twice. TED has received more hype than perhaps any other comedy in the last ten years, but has let me down the most.",2013

8,"First there was Gollum, then Caesar the ape and now ... Ted? If you thought motion-capture animation was beyond the range of foul-mouthed R-rated comedy, here's your evidence to the contrary. ""Family Guy"" creator Seth MacFarlane has taken his love of characters who shouldn't behave like humans behaving like humans to the next level —and the big screen — with ""Ted,"" a story of growing up — at the age of 35.",2012
1,"First of all I absolutely despise Family Guy and its cheap humour and I might be a little biased but I did give this movie a fair chance. I didn't laugh once. Douche MacFarlane is both a terrible writer and voice actor. The story could be told in 15 minutes but is stretched out to 106 boring, dreadful minutes. Even in this one Douche MacFarlane can't resist to hit people in the face with his annoying anti-religious propaganda. He's such a liberal self-absorbed arrogant douche, he doesn't realise he's not funny at all. Pot smoking might be funny for 15-year old teenager and people who have never smoked pot, but when you are past that phase it's just annoying. Other jokes are a prostitute craps on the floor (how funny...), the bear has sex with a trailer trash chick and when he does something wrong at his job he always gets promoted. Well, isn't that just hilarious. Dear Douche MacFarlane, please retire from the entertainment business. When I see your stuff on TV or in the theater it always reminds me of that Billy Madison speech. ""Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.""",2013
8,"I got into a screening of this movie thanks to my daughter, after waiting what felt like forever. I saw the unrated trailer on YouTube and couldn't wait to see it. As another reviewer said, if you like Family Guy, you'll like this. In some ways, it IS Family Guy. Wahlberg basically plays a Peter Griffin type character,a likable, but somewhat dimwitted guy. Ted is essentially Brian, smart, witty and self-centered and Mila is sort of a Lois type, hot and the grown up in the story. Be warned, this is NOT a children's movie. Nudity, drug and alcohol use, plus heavy on the profanity. In other words, go see it! Just leave your (little) kids at home.",2012
1,Saw this and had the constant feeling of awkwardness on behalf of the people producing it. The timing for jokes is sometimes way off. The storyline doesn't make sense in itself (I know speaking toys don't exist - I mean they are inconsistent with the make-believe stuff they tell you).,2012
1,"One of THE MOST sexist and problematic movies I have ever seen in my life. It wasn't funny, it was purely idiotic.",2012
1,Absolutely nihilistic piece of stupidity. Seth MacFarlane's story is beyond the limits of human foolishness. Let him hear it. A mixture of morbid imagination and conscious attack on the minds of degenerated generation. Hidden lie and abominable attempt to profane everything. What inadmissible frivolity it was to show this concoction to the public. I may only suspect of the reasons of those wretched and ill-natured producers to contribute money for nothing but spoiling the minds.,2012
2,"This is the first movie review I've ever done and after watching Ted it ""inspired"" me to write a review. How this movie has close to an 8 star rated is just sad. This movie is downright awful. I'm not really giving any spoilers because there's nothing to give away. It's pretty much an entire, drawn out recent family guy episode. Mark Walberg gets picked on as a child makes a wish and gets a magical talking teddy bear. How cute. Fast forward to when he's a 35 year old loser and Ted is still his best friend. Only now Ted turns out to be a raunchy lil teddy bear who smokes weed drink all that. It doesn't match up. Mark Walberg doesn't seem like the couch sitting loser he's portraited to be. Mila Kunis is his gf of 4 years and she has her life together. But somehow they are a couple blah blah. She wants more from him and their relationship but Ted is bringing him down with his constant drinking, smoking, all that stupid stuff. Her boss Joel McHale is constantly hitting on her but she's happy with her boyfriend. They eventually break up, she goes on a date with her boss so he can stop bothering her and then she still doesn't want him. Walberg ruins their date by performing a stupid song. Ted goes to have a serious chat with her trying to get them back together. She meets him at a restaurant then their makeup gets interrupted by Giovani Ribisi and his son who kidnap Ted. Ted gets ripped apart at Fenway Park and ""dies"" in a sense. Kunis wishes upon a star and he's magically back to life..the end. I can't forget the mention all the jokes throughout the movie. There was a scene where Kunis comes home to find Ted with hookers and there's a dump on the floor. That was kind of funny I did laugh at that scene. And the other kind of funny scene was when Ted is working at a grocery store trying to flirt with a blonde girl so he takes a bottle of lotion and pretends to ejaculate. Now other than that, all of the jokes revolved around Family Guy. Yeah we get it already you made Family Guy (aside from the first 4-5 seasons isn't funny at all) but was it really necessary to make your film the same exact thing as family guy? The concept could have gone so much better. The cast in the movie is great. Mark Walberg, Mila Kunis, and Joel McHale are extremely funny people. And even Giovanni Ribisi. But this movie does not in any way portray just how funny they are. It was just an awful movie. Completely overrated. Seth McFarlene is just not funny. He was at one point. When Family guy first came out it was hilarious. Just such a funny show but after season 5 it's completely redundant and overused jokes don't do it. I'm not one to be easily offended I even love toilet humor/all that crap but this movies sucks. You can't force offensive jokes down people's throats like he does. Being that I'm not a huge McFarlene fan, I wasn't expecting to be blown away. But after how many good reviews it got, I was expecting something more. Not to sit there wondering what other movies I could leave and go see.",2012
1,"This movie was the worst movie I've ever seen. ""Ted"" is a foul mouthed nasty rendition of what used to be a symbol of a sweet toy. You would think that Hollywood get a clue about why all of their movies flop. Either movies are redo's or trash like ""Ted""! It amazes me that movies like this can even be shown at a regular theater. My teenage daughter asked to leave and this was the first movie she has ever done that to. I think what is worse is that Mark Walberg the star of the show has young children who will someday grow up and want to see movies their dad has been in. He should be ashamed of himself and I won't be seeing any of his movies in the future since he is going to stoop to this level of worse than B movies.",2012

9,"Washington gives what is nothing less than a performance of a lifetime in this tension filled film dealing with a pilot wrestling with inner demons. The aviation sequences are stunning and the crash one of the most breathtaking ever filmed. The director is highly gifted and his skill and passion are clearly evident. The script is superb, with intelligent plotting and sharp dialog that captures reality. It is, once again, Washington who shines here above all else. His power as an actor is what truly gives this movies its fire. His portrayal of a substance abusing addict/alcoholic is painful to watch because of the humanity he brings to the part. It is a tremendous accomplishment and one of the finest studies of addiction ever filmed.",2015
8,"Flight takes off with a pulse pounding opening that sets the tone for the movie. However, Flight is not an action movie but instead is an in-depth character study of an alcoholic. While the film itself is a good story and an interesting analysis of one man's addiction to alcohol, the real treasure of Flight is the superb performance from Denzel Washington.",2012
9,"Denzel Washington is William ""Whip"" Whitaker, an alcoholic pilot who, after a night of heavy drinking, remains drunk well into the morning he is to fly a plane into Georgia. When his flight goes into a sudden tail- spin, Whip manages to save all but six lives through his crash-landing. Whip is a hero until his toxicology report comes up positive for everything under the sun, leaving the airline, Whip's union, his friends, and Whip in a tailspin of their own. ",2012
8,"Flight will rank alongside The Lost Weekend, Leaving Las Vegas, etc as one of the classic films about alcoholism. It features, in my view, Denzel Washington's greatest performance to date. It is so easy to overplay a drunk but extremely difficult to get it right and Denzel is spot on and totally believable here as an alcoholic. Also, not many A list actors would play such an unsympathetic character.",2012
7,"Flight is the kind of movie that studio marketing departments seem to hate. Watching the trailer, it gives the feeling of a lighter film, dramatic, with some suspense. It does not, however, indicate that this is an incredibly dark film about the depths and perils of addiction. The trailer gives a completely different idea of what this movie is going to be about, but with Denzel Washington's ""Whip"" Whitaker doing cocaine about thirty seconds into the runtime, one can safely throw away any thoughts they may have had about it.",2013
8,"Robert Zemeckis' latest film Flight starring Academy Award Winner Denzel Washington is not only thoroughly entertaining and terrifically structured, it encompasses a soul that Hollywood hasn't really delivered in quite some time. The film, that closed the New York Film Festival, is simply one of the best films of the year.",2012
9,"FLIGHT is a great film! In a day and age where almost all Hollywood movies try to thrill us with special effects and gore, FLIGHT 'soars' with extraordinary acting and a story that will change lives. I went not knowing really what to expect. A drama about a crashed airplane, right? Well this film is much much more. It is truth. Truth about life. Truth about addictions. Denzel Washington does an awesome, believable job as an alcoholic airplane captain, struggling with his addiction and accusations after the plane crash. John Goodman plays an interesting character and provides some laughs. Without giving too much away, I will say that if you like drama movies or Denzel, go see it. If you are, or know anyone who is struggling with an addiction of ANY KIND... go see it! It just might change your life. 9/10 A+",2012
3,"It is easy to appreciate the high praise for one of Denzel's finest performances, the wonderful cast, and the quality of the narrative and storyline over the course of most of the film. This script had great potential to produce an often compelling story, with fine characters and direction. (I'm ignoring the fact that in everyday reality, a pilot like Denzel's character would be impossible, since professional pilots are subjected to regular drug and alcohol tests.) But, alas, virtually all the reviews and reviewers are blind to the film's fatal flaw.",2012
8,"Trailers might lead you to believe this is a film about flying. Or about an amazing flying feat. But it is all about the lead character, Captain ""Whip"" Whitaker (Denzel Washington), a man who is a pilot and an alcoholic. The flying and a terrible crash provide background for the story of this man, who has struggled with his illness for years.",2014
3,"OK this movie has its moments but sadly moments it is. If you have any understanding of flying then Hollywood immediately broke the laws of physics right in front of your face.The question in my mind while the plane was inverted was 'Well what now? , how do you save this because you can't land upside down and when you turn back over it will nosedive again . . but no when turned back over it glided!!?? So that was the heroic skillful pilot bit debunked at the start. So then we get to the drinking and drug problem. Clichéd enough said and John Goodmans role the 'saviour' was a character who could easily have been Micheal Jacksons personal MD..please. What I find most annoying though is the redemption. The sugar coated epiphany . . I didn't get that bit. He throws away a career he admittedly should not have but in doing so presumably because he could not besmirch the character of his heavy drinking stewardess who was twice as drunk as he was according to the toxicology. The 'Hero Fesses up' and 'heroically' throws away the financial support to his ex wife and son who presumably end up in the Hovel Nicole lived in just to save the face of a stewardess who was already labelled a drunk. Sorry but none of the angles squared up and resolutions only created further questions. Maybe I should have stuck with my original plan to sit and drink coffee and read a few magazines while my wife shopped instead of watching a movie that was designed to provoke your thoughts but when you started thinking you only realised how the plot had well 'missed the plot'. Like the unflyable plane Denzell sadly had an unplayable role. An Oscar? No sorry Denzells' Portrayal missed Micky O'Rourkes Wrestler by a country mile.",2013
3,"I normally only write a review when moved to do so because I love a film, or hate a film. Unfortunately for this film it was the latter case. This film was tedious, confused, boring and uninteresting. It didn't seem to know whether it wanted you to like or hate the protagonist, whether it was trying to be dramatic, funny and quirky or cool - far too many slow-mo scenes of Denzel Washington strolling around in shades looking cool after a drink and drug binge - and in the end it is none of those things. There's only so much you can watch of some guy drinking himself to death - although he doesn't seem to exhibit any physical problems, which is strange. This is no Leaving Las Vegas.",2013
5,"This is a very serious movie. It deals with an issue that is probably more common than any of us who ever fly would probably care to think about - the possibility of alcoholic pilots flying under the influence. There's some potential for this to become a pretty good character study of Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington) - the alcoholic pilot. But it really doesn't manage to do that. There's not much in this character to actually study, to be honest. Whip is an alcoholic pilot, who won't admit that he has a drinking problem and is basically a jerk toward anyone who tries to convince him otherwise. He's not a likable character; he's not a character you really spend very much time rooting for. You're happy at the end of the movie, when he finally makes his confession to the NTSB hearing, and I personally appreciated that at the very end, he seemed repentant and cleaned up and was looking for neither sympathy nor excuses, even as he sat in prison. But there was a lot between the beginning and the end that really didn't work all that well.",2013
5,"Flight is one of those movies where the trailer makes you feel like you know what you're in for, only to find out the movie has nothing to do with a plane crash or planes in general.",2013
4,Full Disclosure: Hold a Private Pilots License. ,2012
4,"I watched the movie as I read here on IMDb that ""An airline pilot saves a flight from crashing, but an investigation into the malfunctions reveals something troubling."" OK, I thought, good cast, Denzel usually doesn't let me down and waited for more than 100 mins to see if something would actually happen. But nothing... It turns out that the whole theme of the movie was just alcohol abuse. As a south European, I always have a hard time understanding whats the problem with alcohol abuse in the US, why people cant just enjoy a drink from time to time. On top of that, there are some hints of other drugs abuse, but it seems that for some reason the producers think that smoking isn't that bad after all (I'm a smoker so I can relate to that... LOL).",2012
3,"I really wanted to like this movie but something besides the crash went terribly wrong. Of course Denzel is great, acting wasn't the problem, for the most part. To put it bluntly, the main disaster here was the director pulling punches, playing it safe. Remarkably, the supposed center piece of the movie, the crash, was actually completely irrelevant to the plot. Think about the setup, the pilot was not responsible for the crash and he saved the plane, for the most part, with very few deaths. The movie took great pains to make it clear how extraordinary this was, ""everyone crashed the plane in simulations"" etc. Well, did the pilot's alcoholism help this or hurt this performance? Simple question but this apparently had nothing to do with the moral point of the movie, so somehow his miracle flying and his alcoholism were never considered as related. There could have been many different solutions. E.G. perhaps the pilot missed something obvious in his walk around, so he both ""caused"" the crash and saved the plane, would have preserved the main arc of the story, kept the crash at the center of the movie but legitimately brought in the alcoholism. And the ending simply sucked, in prison, now wiser and honest........sigh, boring, as was the reconciliation with his son, feel good American tripe ending, double sigh.",2012
8,"Excellent character study about a troubled individual. As an airline captain myself, it is very difficult to sympathize with someone who would put his passengers in constant danger by being a chronic substance abuser.",2012
8,"By now you know what the movie is about, so I won't rehash.",2012
1,"The film seems to be in as much denial as a raging alcoholic and its clearly trying to preach that drinking is bad. Yet the opening scene we have the Denzel Washington performing a flight maneuver the red baron would be proud of. The praise for his piloting skills comes up in the film as regular as an internet pop-up. Just so we never forget how good a pilot he is, even if drunk!",2013
7,"Imagine real-life hero pilot ""Sulley"" Sullenberger with a severe drug  and alcohol problem and doing a few lines prior to taking controls in  the cockpit, yet still managing to land his packed airplane with  absolute precision on the Hudson River. Would he still be a hero?  That's the dilemma of the new film, ""Flight,"" which just hit theaters  this week.  This is a difficult movie to sit through. Yet it's tough to decide  which is more gut-wrenching -- watching a doomed airliner packed full  of passengers buckled down in a nosedive headed for near-certain death,  or the central character played by Denzel Washington, whose personal  life is just as out of control.  While Washington's character nicknamed ""Whip"" manages to miraculously  maneuver the aircraft towards a crash landing that undoubtedly saves  lives, the captain comes under increasing scrutiny once the post-crash  investigation begins. Conducted by the National Transportation Safety  Board (NTSB), the investigation begins to reveal some troubling  revelations about Whip and his conduct. Every second of the pilot and  crew's lives are scrutinized, which uncovers some ugly secrets about  how Whip spends most of his free time. Most of the time his best  friends are named Jim Beam and Jack Daniels, with a few lines of  cocaine to add a little spice.  The hero-addict dichotomy is a marvelous dramatic device which helps to  sustain a longer-than-average 2.5 hour movie. The audience faces a real  conflict here. We don't know whether to cheer for Whip to beat the rap  and move on with his life (after all, he heroically saved lives), or be  exposed as the fraud he is so the healing and recovery process can  begin.  Indeed, this film is not so much about the plane crash and aftermath as  it is about addiction and realizing that one has a serious problem.  While the crash scene is one of the most intense such moments ever  recreated on film, the film's highest moments of drama actually occurs  in hotel rooms and in front of refrigerators when Whip faces his  toughest choice -- whether to drink or not. Most of the time, the  bottle wins the war of the inner spirit, just as it tragically so often  does with real life alcoholics.  If there's any doubt about Denzel Washington being one of the finest  actors of our generation, this should finally settle the issue. His is  a resume filled with high moments -- his Academy Award winning  over-the-top portrayal of a corrupt cop in ""Training Day"" perhaps being  his best work. But this performance is every bit as strong for entirely  different reasons. Washington shows great range in this film,  flip-flopping between the boozing jet-setting playboy (played to  perfection) and the sad and lonely loser that deep inside he know he  has become.  It's Washington when he's most vulnerable that carries this film. Just  the right expression at the right time, a teardrop in a rare moment  when he lets his guard down, or displaying a phony facade of going  through the motions while being stoned and high on the inside -- these  are the virtues that only a few actors working today could so  successfully give to an audience. No doubt, Washington's role here will  be remembered when Best Actor nominations come out for this year's  Oscars.  Robert Zemickis' direction is also near-perfect. This is often a dark  and depressing movie, a sort of ""Leaving Las Vegas"" with an airline  pilot in the central sympathetic role. Yet we never get too low, even  watching a man hellbent on self-destruction. Zemickis, perhaps best  known for his direction of ""Forrest Gump,"" handles the material with  great care, managing an excellent supporting cast -- led by two superb  roles by Bruce Greenwood and Don Cheadle -- who serve to change the  mood just when the film seems to become too dark.  There are some scenes and story lines that I found unnecessary. Whip  finds a romantic interest along the way, a fellow addict. I had a hard  time buying the notion that a 20-year career airline pilot would find  much in common with a very plain-looking heroin addict one step up from  doing back alley tricks as someone to find comfort with . The girl  simply lacks any appeal. To her credit, at least she's headed in the  right direction in her recovery while Whip guzzles one beer after  another. But I found her not only to be implausible partner but totally  unnecessary to the story -- adding at least 30 minutes to a film that  probably should have capped out at two hours.  The film builds to a fulfilling climax that won't be revealed here.  Some ends are tied up nicely, while others remain frayed. Which is all  fine -- that's how real life works.  In short, this is good film made much better by the wide range of  talent displayed by one of Hollywood's finest actors. Denzel  Washington's performance alone is reason enough to see the film.",2012
1,"I am a commercial pilot by profession. This crash scene is based very loosely on an Alaska Airways plane that crashed in 2000. Don't get your hopes up: your relatives could not have survived this catastrophic equipment failure if they'd had Whip, fueled by 3 lines of cocaine, at the helm. The elevator jammed ""full nose down"" causing a descent rate of over 13,000 fpm, not 4000 fpm as stated in the movie, (which is a normal rate of descent for a jet). Other pilots flying by relayed to air traffic control that they saw this plane inverted, and in a steep nose down dive.",2012
4,"This was the strangest movie I've seen in a while. The beginning is ?close to an hour? of some AMAZING flight crash sequence scenes. The rest of the movie is about a man's fight with alcohol and drug abuse. Get it on Netflix, watch the 1st hour, go to an AA meeting, come back and watch the last 15 minutes. You won't have missed a thing! The acting was good - but the story is advertised as being about a plane crash, when it's more about man's struggle against himself.",2012
8,"Flight is the story of a commercial pilot Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington) who is able to land a defective plane with extraordinary skill, maneuvering it into an inverted position in order to slow the decent. We see this inverted flight captured in the trailer, but believe it or not this is not the most provocative element of this film. The story is so thought provoking that it will have you walking out of the theater questioning whether or not you could or would choose nobility over self-preservation. Most of what takes place behind the scenes looming like a predator waiting to strike is the blame game, with Whip continuously asserting that no one could have landed that plane except him. That point is supported but it's the collateral damage of his arrogance that is at the forefront of determining liability. The trailer also lets the audience in on the fact that Whip is found to have alcohol in his system as is discussed with Hugh Lang (Don Cheadle) who is the attorney brought in to defend Whip on behalf of the Pilot's association. Hugh was very straight and very narrow, which was the case with most of the characters aside from Whip. It was the dichotomy of Whip's persona so brilliantly conveyed in his mannerisms, responses, and facial expressions that makes the performance Oscar, Golden Globe, BET, Trumpet, Image, MTV and any other awards worthy. If Mr. Washington had uttered eight bars I would say he deserves a Hip Hop award or a Grammy, he was that convincing. I recognized this person that Mr. Washington portrayed so true to life, which is not just a testament to good writing, but mostly to the phenomenal acting talent that is Denzel. All the characteristics that made this individual a hero were the same characteristics that could potentially make him infamous. I will say that I as well as many fans am always open to greater insight into who Denzel is, however the rear view was totally unnecessary. The film does a great job of telling a story about the human condition, nobody is one dimensional and sometimes extreme circumstances make you write yourself a reality check. The question is when you cash that check will you be happy with the results. If you have any fear of flying this is not the movie for you. It will reinforce that fear and possibly cause you to swear off flying altogether. I give this film a green light.",2012
6,"Flight is not a movie about an airplane crash, it's a movie about a alcoholic / drug addict who needs to hit rock bottom, then sink even lower, before finding redemption. Though finely acted by Denzel Washington, his character has few redeeming qualities and it's flat out hard to root for him, even in the clichéd ending. I also have a big problem with the stereotyped co-pilot and his even more blatantly stereotyped wife. The co-pilot, a devout Christian, becomes worthless during the crash sequence, relying on prayer and basically panicking... meanwhile, totally wasted and fried Denzel Washington (drunk and high on coke) saves the day. Then, later in a hospital scene, the co-pilot's Stepfordwife-esque spouse stand by his side, never blinks, and her only dialog consists of her saying ""Praise Jesus"" in a loud monotone every time her husband says something. If minority or gay characters were portrayed as such blatant stereotypes, the critics and mainstream media would be up in arms. Other than that, Flight is a pretty good movie - well acted and directed, and hauntingly realistic. The entire crash sequence is extremely realistic, enough so that I guarantee you'll be thinking about it the next time you hit severe turbulence on a trip somewhere. But,before seeing it, you need to be aware that Flight is not the movie the commercials make you think it is, so go in with your eyes open. Oh, and another note: don't take your kids to see this movie unless exposing them to raunchy language (particularly one scene where a drunk and belligerent Washington tells off a recovering addict)and full frontal female nudity is OK with you.",2012
10,"I gave this a 10 out of 10 for good reason. TMNT being my favorite childhood series I didn't think I could ever see that ""magic"" again. Nickelodeon has surpassed that with this new series. The personalities with each turtle goes much deeper than the simple catch phrases and slap stick persona's we grew up with, yet maintains it with a fresh new approach. ",2012
9,"It was indeed as surprise for me when i watched the season premier, i was a little skeptical and scared to watch as one of my favorite childhood memory could be ruined again. I was sooo wrong, this proved not only to be a worthy watch but added some more elements to the individuality of the characters, for example the height, facial expressions all made the Turtles differentiable from each other *(besides the colored eye band/mask of course). I just fell in awe & admiration within the first minutes, there was just one thing though which withheld a 10 star, cowabungaaaaaa. My most used word as a kid was missing and that was a bummer. It does have many more extras to balance the missing but i still anticipate i may hear it. This is indeed a worthy and more than expected successor to the 80's super-hit show.",2012
10,"As I can imagine many before me, I've held off watching this new show for a long time, afraid it'd damage the overall feeling I have for TMNT. I'll have to note the nostalgia for TMNT is particularly high for me. And the whole Nickelodium thing made me imagine this new show might turn out too kiddie. But oh man what a wonderful surprise and adventure this show has become to me so far. The new designs took a place in my heart after just one episode, and the action and animation does not disappoint at all. I've fallen madly in love with it. The humor is still present, although way less corny and tacky then in the classic cartoon. And the characters are great. Very great, in fact. It's the writing of this show that has sealed the deal for me. Each turtle's personality comes across flawlessly, and even characters that only make a single or fast appearance stick to the memory. Leatherhead, in that regard, has been a highlight. 'His' episode has been the absolute highlight for me so far. Whereas in the classic cartoon he was just a stupid, 1-dimensional cardboard-cutout side character, in this new incarnation he is emotionally laden and a very effective character you can't help but care for. And the running joke where Mickey reassures his brothers that Leatherhead is 'totally mellow', followed by one of the other Turtles to say something that makes him go absolutely bananas, was just golden.",2013
10,"Wow what a shock this show is. I was surprised at how well the characters are written out and how they interact with each other.

10,"Really excellent! One of the reviewers already wrapped it up perfectly, but they did an AMAZING job with this reboot. I too was afraid it would be horrible but I was completely wrong (I was a HUGE fan as a kid and continue to be as an adult). The individuality of the four turtles really makes this thing work. The animation is great. The voices fit the turtles. Story line is good (not a fan of the new per/episode villains though). Hope to see Rocksteady and Bebop soon. The way they are using Krang is also unexpected, but its sort of a neat idea. I hope they keep this up and continue the great story lines. But seriously, where's the COWABUNGA?",2012
10,I honestly believe this is the BEST incarnation of the TMNT since the Original Comics! The way the characters interact off each other and the constant lessons learned throughout the Episodes and the way they tie into the overarching plot is incredibly clever. :) This show creates some very 3-dimensional characters and reintroduces us to our previous fan-favourites in a very special way.,2013
10,"This is one of the, or wait, this is the best TMNT incarnation since the comics! The plot, the script, the characters, everything is great. Like the way they are different between each other, story has humor and seriousness at the same time, which is great. Turtles from the 1987. show were quite silly and too much a like. Don't get me wrong, the show was epic, but I think that this is going to be kids best heroes today. Every character is well written and the story develops really good. I am glad to have this kind of cartoon now, when I am finishing collage. Man, I love being a turtle fan! ",2014

Overall, it's a great show.",2017

And let me tell you, this show is a tribute to the original Turtles story line. I love it. The animation is beautiful. The storyline and writing is excellent. It is oftentimes freaking hilarious. I love it....Except one thing. To have Seth Green do Leonard's voice in season three is a crime. His voice makes my ears bleed. The show does everything so well, it's hard to believe they made this kind of mistake. All other voice acting is superb. I just started season three and i'm not sure i can go on with Seth Green doing Leo's voice. I will try.",2017
10,"I was never into the TMNT when I was little, but when I saw previews of this show, it looked funny and interesting to me, so I gave it a shot. It was SO worth it and I've been watching almost every single episode since it came out. Love the story line and frequent humor and you really get to understand each character, who exactly they are. The VA's they chose suited each character, I think, and it's hysterical. There are a couple episodes that make me laugh for a good 10 minutes every single time I watch them. The anime faces that you often see are beyond hysterical and the previously mentioned VA's, again, really suited the characters. I can't really say anything bad about this show. Kids love it, some adults probably love it too (myself included and I'm almost 27).",2016
10,"This is currently my favorite cartoon and one of the only good ones left on Nick. About everything else on Nick is just terrible.

I love the epic stories and adventures in this cartoon. I love how detailed and creative this show is. I also like the fact that the same voice actor as Donnie plays the original 1987 Raphael. I was mind blown when I found out about this. I love the ninja turtles. I love the characters, the amazing voice acting, the action and humor at the same time. My little brother started watching this and then he got me into it. I LOVE THIS CARTOON AND I GIVE IT A 10/10. My favorite is Raphael. He's awesome and hilarious. Now to close this review...BOOYAKASHA!!!!",2014

Some characters have more development than the others,but that's alright. The show is a lot darker than the classic 1987 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The villains are fantastic. My favorite so far is Tiger Claw. My favorite episode is Slash and Destroy. Loved the way Spike got mutated. I also loved the latest episode (as of writing this review: 10th June 2014 at 06:52am.) Karai finds out who her true father is and goes back to Splinter. That plot twist was an excellent thing to do and I loved it. I can't say much negatives about this show. It's a good show over-all,but I can't think of a negative. But if you're looking for a good show to watch every,what Sunday morning? Then check out Nickelodeon's... Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.",2014

Unlike the Fred Wolf series, these turtles are real ninjas and strike out of, and fade into the shadows. Not fighting in broad daylight like they did constantly in the former. At the core of this series is the values and virtues of the family unit: brotherhood and father-son relationships, just like the original books. A fan like myself couldn't have been more pleased.",2014
1,"This show doesn't deserve the title Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles the show I watched was the one back in 2004 2005 now that was a good show this one is just terrible the storyline for just this whole thing in general are lame Donatello being in love with April Casey Jones act like a dork Raphael have pet Leonardo being a fan of comics the way splinter acts, leather head being mutated by the Krang he was mutated my agent bishop, the way Stockman acts, shredder Bring nothing more than just a nuisance, The jokes are tacky voice actors do a terrible job I mean the animation sucks, lets see what else oh *spoiler alert* not that i care* Kurai being splinter's daughter splinter never talks about his master Yoshi the use of karate terms when they are NINJA TURTLES not KARATE TURTLES",2015
9,"I have to say as most fans of the TMNT series I was shock by how good it was, I thought this would end up like TMNT The next mutation but Nick sure avoided that. I mean I am a fan of all the TMNT universes, comics, 80's, 2k3 but this takes all of these and mashes them together to give all fans a good vibe. Now first I'll start off with what I dislike, Boyakasha is dumbest catch phrase ever unless it's just cowabunga in Japanese, but I doubt it. And I also dislike Splinters height, sorry but I like to see old short Splinter, finally it's Raphaels voice sorry Sean Astin but to me Raphael has a deeper more new yorker sounding voice, sure you did better then the 80's series Raph but I mean I picture more of the movies voice actors or 2k3 actor you just sound to high pitched and slightly whiny. Now what I do like is everything else, good plot good mixing over the universes and honestly I am happy to never have to see Bebop and Rocksteady ever again, sorry 80's fans but they weren't in the original comics at all so screw them. krang on the other hand had a cool voice and he and shredder had good chemistry so he made up from not being in the comics with that. Monalisa would be an interesting character to bring back in this new show after all Don has April and bring back Karai and Kala for Leo and Mikey just to make more love interest for the turtles. But that's only my option, I give this a clean 9 out of 10. Good job Nick",2012
8,"I'm going to first point out that I was so skeptical of this show I was bashing it before the premier. The 80s cartoon is near and dear to my heart and I can quote the first live action movie from beginning to end. The last installments gave me no hope that the turtles would ever have a deserved reboot. All I can say is shame on me. One night I was bored and decided ""Let's see the train wreck this is bound to be."" Not only was a I wrong but ended up laughing at the jokes and smiling like I had seen my old friends again. I have a couple issues with the reboot but nothing that ruins the overall production. What made me skeptical and groan in the beginning was knowing it would be computer generated. Having watched all the current episodes it's easy to see where cg is possibly the better medium for TMNT. Especially in the facial region. What I like right away *as stated by another reviewer* is the differences in their appearance and personalities. I recently rewatched quite a bit of the 80s cartoon and agree their personas didn't reflect teenagers but much older and mature. Heck, even Raphael didn't have the attitude he's known for and was fairly calm. Also the voice actors seem more appropriate with their designated turtle than the old. Granted I still love the original best Rob Paulsen is better suited as Donatello than Raphael. Another thing to be mentioned is they got the pairings *as far as we've seen* correct. Leo and Ralph clash since they have strong personalities competing for the same thing. *to be the leader* Whereas Mikey and Don mesh well and tend to get along, though they sometimes egg the other on. It was really awesome to see the chemistry there. I'm interested to see how they utilize April's younger approach and if they bring in my other favorite, Casey Jones, into the mix. I'll admit, I feel silly still watching kid shows but between most of the stupidity *cough* ""Honey boo boo"" *cough* on cable nowadays I'll take TMNT in a heartbeat. No matter my age I'll always love these characters and it's comforting to see them finally being portrayed well. This show may not be for everyone but this hardcore fan is more than content. Now if they could just say cowabunga instead of booyakasha...",2012
1,"yes it was. The 2003 series was darker and followed the comics pretty well while also including new aspects. It had story arches that spanned multiple episodes if not entire seasons so you were hooked into going back for each episode. It didn't sensor the action near as much as the 2012 series does. It's toned way down on the nickelodeon version when compared to the 2003 one. It still had Mikey's sense of humor and Leonardo's sense of leadership. They got the turtles personalities right on. The flashy CGI in the new one doesn't make it better content wise. Obviously the new series is meant to appeal a young viewer while the 2003 series is meant for an older audience. not necessarily adults but an older audience still. One that has the attention span to remember what happened in the episode one week prior. I would equate any adult that likes this series better than the 2003 series to BRONIES. ""Bros who love my little pony"" for those who don't know. For gods sakes the emoticons that sprout over their heads when something happens are hokey and ridiculous. Its not a coyote and roadrunner cartoon and it shouldn't try to be. ",2014
8,"Well i have been waiting for a old 80s reboot and this is by far the closes. Through the entire one hour premier i was smiling and laughing feeling like a kid again. They added some anime elements which is pretty fresh and new and it fits in quite well. Reason i did not give it a 9 or 10 is because Ralph still has that bad attitude like in the movies which i never cared for, but he is still very sarcastic so it balances it out. I did not see bebop or rocksteady which is sad, but they were hinting about Krane. Oh and the footsoldiers look human and r not like the old cartoon. But its just a minor thing u can easily forget. So final verdict if you like the 80s or grew up with it, you will enjoy this like i did, i am setting up my dvr and recording all the episodes. Good job laird and Eastman for bringing me back the turtles i fell in love with so long ago. :)",2012
8,"Ninja turtles is one of my favourite franchises of all time and when I heard they were remaking the original cartoon and it will be on nickelodeon, I was sceptical, when the first episode was finally on nickelodeon, I thought I should give it a watch, I was hooked, this show not only better then the original, it's better then most cartoons that are on TV these days. I really was shell shocked to find out that Rob Paulsen, the original Raph, is returning to voice my favourite turtle, Donatello. Jason Biggs is very good as Leonardo, I'm a huge American Pie fan and Jason Biggs is a pretty decent actor. Greg Cipes as Michelangelo is a perfect choice, his voice and personality fits Mikey very well. Sean Astin is my second favourite Raphael because this new Raphael has more of a personality then the other incarnations of Raphael, this Raphael as more of a soft side then the other Raphaels, this new Raph does still act like a hothead but he has a lot more character then the other Raphs. The rest of the cast is fantastic and I'm excited to see new cast members take on classic tmnt characters. Episode 1 is were they re-introduce the turtle characters, and they did a great job, Leo is still the leader, Raph is still a hothead, Mikey is still fun and Donatello is still the nerd. Splinter is interesting, he's more emotionally scared then the other incarnations, but he is more badass, he fights and helps his sons in battle, which is shown in the season 1 finale. April is now a teenager which I like because she can relate more to the turtles. Donnie has a crush on April that is funny but gets old pretty fast. The first episode is were the turtles turn 15 and they want to go to the surface for the first time, splinter allows it but he wants them to stay in the shadows. The turtles discover pizza and the kraang. They meet April and her father then they get attacked by the kraang. The battles are fun and epic to watch, then the turtles chase a van and find out that the can is carrying ooze, that mutated them into mutant turtles. They meet snake, who works for the kraang, snake tells the turtles were the kraang r hiding April and her father. The turtles go to the kraang hide out and save April while snake gets mutated into a weed monster named Snakeweed, a huge battle happens, the turtles say goodbye to April and go back to the sewers, what a way to start a great show. The other episodes in season 1 are all about finding out the kraang and shredders secret and they have to stop them. Season finale is amazing and epic, the fighting is awesome, the music is amazing, the animation is great, the shredder is more badass then the 80s shredder, the characters are just incredible. season 2 is about the turtles finding canisters of mutagen that is scattered around the city, they meet Casey jones, who is also a teen, and a bunch of new mutants. Season 2 is so far amazing and I can't wait for more episodes to come, if your a huge tmnt fan, check it out.",2014
10,"I had my doubts about this show at first due to the tone of cartoons of this generation. But when i decided to watch the first episodes, i loved it forgive me for being sceptical earlier on. This show is like a mix of the 1908s cartoons and the 2003 series. It had action, comedy, drama all rolled up into one. This will get you laughing in stitches or have you at the edge of you seats! This cartoon really brings back that nostalgic feeling. It's the type of cartoon for fans of all-ages, both old and new. Each episode will leave toy wanting more and more and it got me actually interested in the comics, when i never read a TMNT comic before in my life!! Highly recommend this show for anyone who is a TMNT fan!",2013

7,"In this day and age, horror is getting more and more creative by demand since the psycho killer in the woods-scenario has pretty much run its course. A consequence of that is the incorporation of contemporary technology and concepts appearing in the genre; ""found footage"" films have replaced Jason and Michael, and while these films do have potential (this year's indie ""V/H/S"" had some neat ideas), even they are beginning to lose steam. Enter ""Sinister"", which is an amalgam of timeless supernatural horror themes and ""found footage"" technique that has proved to be a consistent box office draw.",2012

Upon moving in, Ellison finds a box of super 8 films in the attic. On the tapes are the murders of the family who previously lived in his house and four other murders dating back to 1966. The only connection between the murders is a symbol found in all the videos.

10,"Sinister is very well made horror film. It is the only scary horror film I've seen for a very long time. It's never too cliché as most horror movies are. It never cheats you. The performances are believable and the story is intriguing and always moving. The director has control over his audience, and the audience is completely okay with that. I knew early into the film what kind of horror film it was and I how it would scare me. And that what was one of things it had going for it. You can anticipate the scares and that makes it much more frightening. Do not confuse anticipation with predictability. The movie wasn't too gruesome, which left more room for actual fear. All in all, it is a very good film, So good, it's almost... Sinister...",2012

The movie is so unconventional and different than most horror movies in a way that it makes you wonder if its a true story. Best part is that it makes you think and there are so many scenes wherein you just want to pause the movie because you just cant handle the intense suspense. Its a must watch and you will not regret for even a single moment, all the more a true horror movie fan would get peace of mind for a good deal of time before they would want to watch another spin chilling horror movie.

Based around a series of jump scare sequences and slow character sections in order to attempt to make you feel for the characters while easing the tension of the situation. It's a tired formula that is becoming all the more clichéd and repetitive. However Sinister manages to find ways to break free of these leashes that the horror genre is becoming tied down to.",2012

I am positive it is the latter, considering the scares in this movie were horribly predictable and cliché.

I predicted about 80% of this movie while I was watching it, and there was only one time when I didn't know he was going to pop out.

3,"I was not able to get in to this movie. I'm a sucker for scary movies, and although this one did make me jump a few times the fear factor in this film is fully from the sense of surprise, not actual 'fear' itself. Every time I found myself starting to get involved in the movie, it would pull me back out by a lack of continuity and complete predictability. The story is overplayed, most of the elements in this film we have seen over and over and over again. You can tell within the first 10 minutes what is going to happen, and then you just sit there and wait for it to unfold. An hour and a half later when it does unfold, the movie comes to a sudden end, and you are left disappointed - all that waiting and then nothing really happens. Such an overplayed premise - the film opens with the family moving into a house where someone had been killed in the past - there's a shocker. Of course one of the kids has some weird oddity that picks up on the vibes instantly. The husband is a writer (why do writers in films always have such a shitty sense of style?) the wife is.. who knows.. she's just there to add more tension to the situation. Husband finds some film that documents the crime he is writing about, that occurred in the house.. ooh gee how did it get there? who knows.. what a mystery - sooo scary, we've never seen anything like that happen before. He watches the video and it documents the crime, as well as others - he watches it and finally notices a character and a symbol that repeats in each video. He talks to some college professor (wow something else we've never seen before - though the 'professor' was probably the most interesting character in the entire movie) who lets him know it's some old ancient god that of course doesn't exist, and how it is some initiation.. meanwhile in every video one person from each family isn't present - an overly-obvious foreshadowing of who committed the actual crimes (the children themselves) ..now of course when he watched the video it released the spirit of this demon god whatever, the movie then just shows an hour straight of them having random situations where the spirit of this ghost or of the kids interfere - randomly popping up giving us a little startle but after the first 2 minutes of this it becomes obvious what is going to happen next in just about every scene.. When they finally let the story play out of course it gets to be too much and they all run back to their old home town - and conveniently as soon as they get there they discover that every family who has been killed, lived at the house of a previous murder - this part is I guess a ""unique twist"" but now what you knew was going to happen is confirmed, the youngest daughter kills the family then gets sucked into the movie reel which gets left in a box for the next family to find..",2012

4,"While Sinister does offer enough scares I found it to be a lack luster affair. When I was going to see this film I didn't know what to expect. When I was watching it I have to admit that it put my nerves on edge. Unfortunately, it doesn't do this in any innovative way. Sinister relies too much on jump scares, and consists of Ethan Hawke as Ellison Oswalt interacting with things like a laptop and a supernatural projector. There are supporting characters but they're often nothing more than plot devices. At one point Vincent D'Onofrio pops in as Professor Jonas only via iChat to provide more info about the baddie. One has to give Hawke some credit because he does deliver a good performance as a frightened family man, but it's just silly when the demon Bughuul (a.k.a. Mr. Boogie) looks like a member of a heavy metal band. In the end we still get to know almost nothing about this Pagan deity and he has very little screen time. It's clear that Sinister was heavily influenced by the Japanese horror genre and Paranormal Activity (2007). It features a silly conspiracy involving Super 8 footage, several children and the demon baddie. Because the film aims so much to shock you with a minimal plot you have to watch scenes which make no sense. Director Scott Derrickson made it a thing to show doors being closed and the projector being turned on again and again. It seems that some moviegoers consider Sinister a good horror film because it gave them a difficult time. Unfortunately, when you're done watching it and look back on it you can't help but notice the unexplained and the silliness. The film should have been more serious. As a horror flick it's passable but I don't recommend watching it.",2012
1,"This was one of the WORST horror movies I have seen in a long time!!! (Short of ""The Bay"", which managed to be just a tiny bit worse than this one.) I am an Ethan Hawke fan, and I can honestly say he was the best actor in the movie... Besides Ethan, the rest of the acting was not good! The lines were hokey, not at all believable. And I would personally like to scold whoever composed the musical soundtrack for this movie! It was extremely irritating and/or sounded like bad porn music at times... Absolutely terrible. The ""special effects"", i.e. the dead children and Mr. Boogie, were awful - obviously computer animated, and you saw them so often they lost their scare factor. As a true horror fan, I feel there were SO many things they could have done to make this movie better and scarier! The story was very predictable and disappointing. If you paid to see this in the theater, I am sorry for your waste of money... If you haven't yet, DON'T BOTHER!!!!!",2012
5,I just watched this movie and I was like scare me already! It takes awhile for the movie to get up to speed (More like turtle crawl). It was predictable as other posts have mentioned and the wife was a super nag I was really hoping she would get killed in the 1st 1/2 hour!,2012

I kept waiting for the creepy, eerie, give me nightmare scenes to begin and then the movie ended. And what was with the soundtrack? The soundtrack did more damage to the film then help it. If the music was better it would have helped this sorry movie. You want to slap the wife upside the movie when she clearly played the blonde bimbo to a ""T"". You kid gets in trouble on his first day of school and no one tole him he was living in the house where the family was killed??? HELLO!! She is so supportive of her husband that she doesn't what to know what he is writing about?(I support you honey, just don't talk to me about your job). She goes shopping and gets glares from people but no one blurts out she is living in a creepy house. And can we talk about the attic? from the outside your luck to have space enough for insulation, but once inside you can practically stand up? The movie just starts to take off during the last 15 minutes and then it ends. Sequel to this movie will be officer so and so writing a book, movie and millions. This would have been scarier if people would turn the dang lights on. Come on guys, make a scary movie that is really scary.",2012

Jumped a couple of times and the length of the movie was perfect. have no complaints. I thought Ethan Hawke was perfect for the picture and his wife in the movie (ive never seen) was very great also. From all the way back from the 60s there were murders of the entire family, but one of the kids always came up missing. and each family murdered it was like a 10 year span from each other and they all previously lived in the same house the previous family was murdered in. It all came together in the end, it was a great story and movie. cant wait till it comes out on DVD. Great job!!!!!",2012

1,"Movie 43 is a collection of twelve short films starring twenty-five big name celebrities and not containing even a fraction of the laughs in its ninety-seven minute runtime. Connected in a disjointed manner and baiting the audience by a filled cast, this is one of the most unpleasant times at the movies one could have. Not since Garry Marshall's Valentine's Day have we seen so many shining actors succumb to such joylessly impotent material. Only this time, the material is not only impotent, but crass and well over the line of reprehensibility to the point where one shakes their head and assures their inner-self to walk out of the theater, walk to the nearest video store and rent as many foreign films as they can carry.",2013

It is only on a rare occasion anymore that I actually buy a ticket for a movie with any hope that it might actually provide entertainment, which is a shame. This movie, however, just lowered the bar- by a LOT. Hands down one of the worst movies that I've ever seen- and that's saying something. It is just a gaggle of actors working on an acid-trip of a script. Every bit of comedy is based on shock value, which wears thin on your patience very early on. It's gross, lewd, and utterly lacking of any wit or connection with the audience. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this to anyone- as I nearly went up to the box office and demanded a refund. It isn't even that I'm a prude or hate gross-out humor, I'm 18 for crying out loud- I just have the ability to recognize when someone put actual effort and thought into making a movie funny and when Hollywood is laughing AT US, instead of vice versa.

1,"I want to let each and everyone reading this review know that I created this IMDb account for the sole purpose of writing a review for this very movie, Movie43. First, I would like to start by mentioning how the movie trailer is very misleading and provides people with false hope and expectations. From public defecation, to having one's testicles on one's neck, and even incestuous relationships are only a few of the many examples of the dark and rather disgusting sense of humor that along with the imagery of the movie create a rather repellent and false portrayal of sex and other universal themes. Additionally, Movie 43 consists of several unrelated scenes that do nothing in terms of both the plot and characters' development of the movie. This movie is so bad that it has the ability to infect one's nerve cells with both aids and cancer, creating a new type of nerve cells that reproduce at an exponential rate and possess the ability of causing one's IQ level to drop dramatically. If you don't want to waste your precious time and intelligence, then listen to what I and many others have to say about this movie and simply don't waste your time watching it. Every user that claims that this movie is nothing else but absolute rubbish is telling nothing else but the honest truth. There is this saying that seems very appropriate given the main message that I am trying to convey; ""Curiosity killed the cat"". This saying serves as a warning declaiming to not let your curiosity get the best of you! A great number of people, myself included have fallen prey into this very trap and have made the very mistake of disregarding many of the wise reviews proclaiming that this movies is complete balderdash as it lacks plot development and many more elements crucial to a movie's reputation and watch-ability. Just like Plato, a well known Greek Philosopher said: ""A wise person learns from his mistakes! A wiser one learns from others' mistakes!"" I hope this review came in handy and opened your eyes to the harsh reality that is Movie 43. I wish each and every one of you the best of luck!!! Trust me, you will need it!!! XD",2017
1,"Wow, just wow. I'm astonished. I've seen over a thousand movies in my life, and out of all of them, this is the worst. Its worse than The Garbage Pail Kids Movie, After Last Season, and Ren Seeks Help. This is the worst, most pointless, hollow, and lazy excuse for a theatrical feature I've ever seen. There is no vision or creativity here, its literally just a bunch of unrelated 5-minute skits. I could at least give this movie some credit if the skits were funny at all, but they're not. They're all disgusting and repulsive. As I sat through the first skit, I was like ""well that sucked, maybe the next one will be better"". After the next four, I was like ""well maybe one of them will make me laugh"". I was wrong. The rest was just a vapid, soulless, agonizing experience. I didn't laugh, chuckle, or even involuntarily smile during this whole movie. The whole product just feels cynically slapped together with no respect for its audience and for the sole purpose of making money. Many of the celebrities they got were either bribed or guilt tripped into being in their skits. This isn't even a real movie; its like a bunch of unfunny YouTube videos mashed together. Think of the 15 worst Smosh videos you've seen, and watch them back to back. That's basically this movie but with more depraved sexually graphic content and random celebrities. You'd have a lot more fun watching YouTube videos for 90 minutes than watching Movie 43. Normally I have no problem with gross and inappropriate content, but only if there's a point. This movie represents everything wrong with Hollywood. Slimy film business practices typically only happen occasionally behind the scenes of most mainstream films. Every decision involved in the making of this movie started with the thought ""We could exploit the Hollywood system by..."". Movies like this are the reason IMDb should allow a 0- star rating. This movie is nothing. This movie deserves nothing. Therefore, I shall give it nothing.",2017

I can't say enough bad things about this. Wow! It even mentioned ""Howard the Duck"" as a bad movie. So, they know about bad movies. This will probably take the place of ""Howard the Duck"" as the worst movie of all time.",2013
1,"Omg, I'm very open person but for the first time I went out of a movie after 30minutes. Feeling sick. We didn't know what to do with ourselves. Went to a shop to buy anything and everything to reset our brains. :) I just made an account here, only to express that it is simply not fair! I feel cheated. How people can lie so much in the description of the movie. I can't believe those actors took part in it. What a shame. Why? Why! This is only for people who laughs at obscenities and profanity. And defecation. But if you surprisingly don't, it's not funny at all. I was waiting for any story behind it but.. no. There was nothing there.",2013

However, no review could prepare me for what I was about to see. Movie 43 is a culmination of 'comedy' skits directed by a multitude of talented people - talented people that decided to bang their heads against a wall and create a script after they had acquired a multitude of seizures and other types of brain damage. Movie 43 is weak, no new jokes are present here. The type of humor that exists in Movie 43 is the type of humor your troubled 13-year-old son would find in the dark side of Youtube. This movie isn't a comedy, it's a horror-drama. You're sad that you're watching it, and horrified when it ends.

1,"When it comes to revolting, unfunny, uninvolving, cancerous films, this film takes the cake. This film is literally everything wrong with the film making industry and I can't bare the fact that this film somehow got the attention of the cast in this film. It's amazing how unfunny this film is. Literally any skit on YouTube is better and more worth your time. This film tries to be funny by being offensive and gross, which really doesn't do anything besides make the viewers go ""Ew, god. Why?"". Did I mention that this film literally has no story? This film is literally just weird and unfunny skits that are inferior to the skits you'd find on YouTube. You'd think for a film with literally no story, there'd be at least something good about it otherwise. But I can think of nothing. I'm honestly debating on whether or not this is the worst film I've ever seen. The reason for that is because I'm not even sure if this is even a movie. It's just a compilation of really dumb and weird skits that, again, YouTubers can do better, and for a big Hollywood ""film"" like this, that's embarrassing. If this is the future of comedy sketches in films, we have officially reached the bottom of the barrel, and I think we're done here. I recommend to just watch comedy sketches on YouTube instead, as literally nothing about this film is worth anyone's time whatsoever. It is really weird and unfunny. And I'm okay with some weirdness here and there that is at least well executed. But again, this film is gross and offensive, and for some reason, I'm supposed to find that funny? I hope Hollywood has learned their lesson because I couldn't bare another one of these so called ""films"" again.",2017

I don't really think its a 10, but I'm giving it that just to stick it to you humorless snobs. Perhaps you won't find this movie suitable to your ""evolved"" pallets, but for those of us that still laugh at farts, and make dick jokes and think seeing someone getting punched in the balls is funny, then you should be amused by this one.

Not even funny at all and I personally think that it gave the actors and actresses a BAD reputation! And I really loved those actors/actresses, and now I just look at them differently.

7,"If you have seen conspiracy flicks like ""Enemy Of The State"", ""The Bourne Identity"", ""XIII"", ""Unknown"" and so on and so forth, you really won't be surprised by this movie. The story presents nothing new and is about the usual stereotypes: the good one turn out to be the bad ones, the bad ones turn out to be the good ones, the weak ones turn out to be the strong ones and so one. I think you get what I mean. The movie has no big surprises after all.",2012
7,It is so very difficult to find new material when you piece together a governmental conspiracy movie. Safe House is able to do it to a point. The greatest success of this movie is the usage of modern film techniques. Too often the bulging budget and ability to edit in effects makes action/thriller movies extremely unrealistic. Safe House does the opposite. It takes all of these techniques and uses them to make the movie raw and real.,2012
9,"I'll be honest. When I saw the trailer, I was madly excited. It looked fantastic. But then, after a while, I remembered, that the main point of a trailer is to do just that. Hype the film, while revealing literally all the main plot scenes and parts. I didn't know if it was the case with 'Safe House', since, hey, it's Denzel Washington. That man doesn't just do any role.",2012
7,"I'm of the opinion that out of all the movie stars and would-be movie  stars in Hollywood, Denzel Washington is one of, if not THE, safest  bet. I say this because I don't think I've ever met a person who  dislikes the man. In a culture that is built upon strong opinions and  holding to said opinions fiercely (this is the backbone of the industry  in many ways), it is a remarkable feat to put together a 20+ year  career like Denzel has without drawing the ire of someone or some  group. Age, race, and gender seem to matter not when it comes to  Denzel, whose films almost always find a way to exceed expectations  whether they are magnificent (Training Day, American Gangster) or  wholly lackluster (John Q, Unstoppable). There is an overriding sense  among a high percentage of moviegoers that if Denzel is in, so are  they. Safe House, a solid if uninspired action thriller, has proved  this theory to be true.   Instead of the undercover investigations and shoot outs he expected  when he joined the CIA, Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds) has been relegated  to manning a safe house in Cape Town, South Africa. He is bored and he  wants some action, a desire that is all too well fulfilled at the  outset of the film when former CIA agent-turned-traitor Tobin Frost  (Washington) is brought to his house for interrogation. Soon after his  arrival, a militant force arrives to take possession of Frost, killing  the highly-trained team that brought Frost into the house. With no  other option, Weston grabs Frost and makes a bolt for it, barely  escaping the unknown villains who killed his comrades. With no other  teams in the area, Weston's superior, David Barlow (Brendan Gleeson),  tasks him with keeping Frost alive and in custody until he can be  collected, a proposition which turns out to be much more difficult and  complex than Weston would have ever imagined. With the assailants hot  on their trail and Frost crawling deeper and deeper in Weston's head,  the young agent must think fast and learn on the run before he becomes  another casualty of a dirty battle that Frost has sucked him into.  There are a few departures from the main storyline at work within Safe  House but these distractions are only there to lengthen the film and  add some uninteresting depth. This film lives and dies on the  performances of Reynolds and Washington, both of whom come through  beautifully. It's been a rough year for Reynolds whose star status has  been thrown into serious question with the failures of Green Lantern  and The Change-Up. This role, however, is a better fit for him,  allowing him to share the load with an established genre veteran  instead of being relied upon to carry a major film on his own. I was  pleasantly surprised at his ability to give Weston more depth than what  you usually get with this sort of film and I thought he hit the right  balance between being a half- terrified, inexperienced field agent and  being that hardened, ""see this thing through to the bitter end""  character that Safe House had to have. Washington, meanwhile, is a tour  de force, exuding both charisma and menace in just the right amounts.  Always a commanding presence on the screen no matter what his role,  Washington is at his best when delivering his lines in that quiet,  calm, measured manner which he has become famous for and this is a role  that calls upon that ability several times. I can't say that this is  one of Washington's best portrayals and it's certainly a safer choice  than I'd like to see an actor of his caliber make, but it is  nonetheless a reminder of exactly why just about everybody digs what  this guy has been selling for two decades.   Every other element of Safe House plays second fiddle to the work done  by the two leads. The action is intense and somewhat gritty; when a  shot is fired, you feel it as much as hear it, a characteristic I quite  like in a serious action film. The plot itself is rife with  generalities and clichés, making the film about as paint-by-numbers as  they come. Personally, though, I didn't get caught up in these  half-hearted missteps too often. Better choices could certainly be  made; the major ""twist"" could be seen from a mile away and the  conclusion was unsatisfactory for me. But given director Daniel  Espinosa's relative inexperience behind the camera and the sheer power  of Washington's star appeal, these are issues I found easy to overlook  as the film progressed. It's nothing new and it's not a film I want to  watch a dozen times over but for what it is, Safe House provides an  entertaining and appealing experience.",2012

This sends Weston to a dizzying panic and eventually escapes along with Frost.",2012
7,"Safe House is a movie that fulfils its popcorn intentions, but metaphorically brings to mind the image of a bobble-head – a bloated brain supported by little else, springing uncontrollably in different directions. When the action ramps up, Safe House is at its best, providing ample energy, a plethora or gunplay and a number of gritty combat sequences. When pausing to forward the plot, spew exposition or focus on perfunctory romances, it grinds to a halt. Safe House would be better viewed with a remote equipped with a fast forward button nearby.",2012
1,"Safe House starring Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds is just one of those pointless boring generic and very derivative weak ""action"" films. The performances are really not that good to be honest. The dialogue and script is boring and cliché. Now I am a fan of both Ryan and Denzel's work in the films they have appeared in before, but this one is just nonsensical. The plot is utterly muddled and horribly boring and just downright uninteresting. The action scenes are just kinda take it or leave it, nothing new at all to bring to the table. There isn't anything new, exciting, or even mildly entertaining here. This movie is just bad at engaging the audience, making the audience actually give a crap what happens. I sure didn't care that happened. How could I??? I was too busy checking the time on my phone LOL. Skip this one, save your heartache. Don't say i didn't warn you. 1/10.",2016
1,"OK I live in Capetown so I may have a jaundiced view of this movie . First of it is a below average conspiracy movie of no remark . The thing that struck me about it was how the script was somehow manipulated to show various parts of the Cape (or Capetown). Was this actually written in conjunction with cape tourism , It certainly looks that way . Maybee the production company got discounts on filming fees in return for showcasing various parts of the cape .Oh and by the way if you have to have a car chase at least have some kind of continuity reality to it for the viewers who are from the place were you are filming , you cut from Capetown central to nearby highways to suburbs and townships 20 miles from downtown in the same chase , I wont even start on the white elephant world cup football stadium ,Ridiculas , Anotherthing Capetown is still extremely racist and divided by suburb on race lines of old , the idea of a white man living in langa by choice is f*cking laughable So if your not from Capetown its just about watchable but please don't think your getting any sense of this town from the movie",2012

However, upon viewing Safe House, my expectations were met and a little more.

7,"""Safe House"", directed by Daniel Espinosa, is more like a 7.25 out of 10. What really works for the movie is unsurprisingly a good script and 2 seasoned likable actors. The story has some novelties along with it as well, in no small part, the Safe Houses (hence the title) (spoiler) which become anything but safe. I thought the action scenes mostly were well crafted including chase scenes and close in fist-fights. ((spoiler) I especially liked Reynolds as coming off novice believably. Aside from the stupidity of having the Reynolds character bring Washington to a soccer match in public and the predictability of who turns out to be a double-crosser, the movie is a good watch. It's worth a rental anytime and exceeded my expectations. Recommended.",2012

Turns out there are bad people who do government spying, they appear to be, hope you're sitting down, duplicitous, greedy, violent. I know, who would have thunk it? The movie essentially has a bunch of murderers of one CIA stripe killing a bunch of murderers of another CIA stripe, that's pretty much the beginning and end of it. Nothing else at stake, no giant Maguffin, nuclear annihilation, the discovery of the holy grail, whether Lindsey Lohan will ever pull out of her dive, nothing here. And really good actors doing mostly nothing of interest in service to nothing of consequence. No one was seen in a good light here, oops, save the French girlfriend and one simply perfectly shot aerial scene of a car going vertically up the screen through fields, a relatively short shot, but magnificent nonetheless, painterly, in fact. Otherwise, when its done you just had to ask yourself, how did this get funded? What was the decision process for this?",2012

After about 30 minutes into this movie, the constant thought that was running through my head was when this movie was going to end. Cause it's dull and boring all the way through even with the gun fights and the chase scenes. Denzel Washington plays Tobin Frost who was this legendary CIA but turned rogue. In the trailer it seemed like he would be a cold and yet slick character who knew exactly what he is doing. But that was just few minutes into the movie and he keeps making this lazy mistakes for a character who is supposed to be this legendary agent. If he at least kept his character most of the way through it would have been a more watchable more to some degree. The theater was packed for this movies release date but none of the audience seemed excited of enjoying there time while watching this dull and generic movie that is predictable all the way through. Some even left in the middle of this lazy movie. Even two good actors couldn't save this movie from being a utter unoriginal boring movie. I give it a 3.4/10 cause I seen worse.",2012

1,"I ate 4-cheeses tortellini for lunch and then went to see ""Battleship"". guess which one was cheesier. This movie is terrible and I'll tell you why, but first let me say one thing. This is not how action movies should be made and it is not fair to make bad movies just to cash some money because ""hey, it's an action movie!"" I don't believe in low class genres: is not a sin to enjoy an action movie, but it should be a good movie anyway! Battleship has an horrible plot, actually nothing happens but it does it in more than 2 hours. God if it was boring! I don't understand how you could ever make a movie with explosions and fast-paced editing sooo boring. There are elements that make to sudden apparitions and too much plot holes. There are some TERRIBLE comic scenes, like the one where the guy is stealing a burrito for his bigtittied trophy. In that moment it becomes American pie, the family guy, epic movie. There's a LOT of FAKE lens flare. I don't understand why, is it a fad now? In super8 they had a meaning, but in battleship there are even more and they really make no sense. Every single clichè, you can find it in here. well, we live in a postmodern period so that's okay, we are used to see old clichés. The problem is that they use them like it is 1980 and it's the first time. If you care about that, the aliens are really a bunch of pussies. They invade earth and the humans have to struggle a little to fight them. Yeah, just because they use only THREE American ships (actual war ships, not space ships) and a couple of airplanes. It's the lamest alien invasion ever! Don't watch this movie because is really really bad. What could I expect from a movie inspired by the eponymous game?

It's full of humour, drama and cheer-on scenes. I also see how brave and smart our men can be in the Navy and how they achieve the greatest award ever: Respect. Also, I like how they slightly recreate a WWII battle with the Americans and the Japanese but really, the American Navy and the Japanese Navy team up to stop the Aliens. Great Movie!",2014
9,"This film, best considered a younger cousin to the classic Independence Day (which I confess I have seen about a dozen times, NOT MY FAULT, they keep showing it every independence day! Duh!) is one of those all-too-common entries in the IMDb database that simply don't make sense. First of all look at the number of IMDb members who have taken time off their busy schedules to comment. Seriously, go check. I'll wait here until you get back. See the problem? If the film were really that mundane, that forgettable, would there really be so many people willing to comment? (Note to IMDb intelligentsia -- do people review films because they genuinely want to leave a guidepost for viewers of the future, or do they review films because they simply love a good scrap?) In any case, for those readers who are interested, I will point out that while the acting is merely OK, the script, this massively un-appreciated script, is to die for. In other words, the writers completely understood that to connect with the audience, you start small, you build bridges, and then you escalate and escalate and ultimately you provide a payoff. Sound simple? Then why don't more movies have scripts as smooth as this one? (Ditto for Independence Day, the script there is a work of art as well). And in case you wondering, can a good story by itself elevate a film to classic status? Darn right! In any case, I gave a rating which I consider commiserate with the actual entertainment value. Footnote: in a silent homage to the series Battlestar Gallactica, which was unique and ground-breaking in so many ways, the producers cast Rihanna, one of the most striking women of the century, in the uniform of a Chief Petty Officer and then watched with bemusement (I think) as male viewers had their eyes pop out of their heads every time she got screen time.(In BSG the analogue was Kandyse McClure.) A really solid entertaining film deserving a much higher rating.",2014
7,"On a certain level, there's no way I can claim that Battleship is a good movie in any conventional sense. The plot is incredulous and the script couldn't be riddled with more holes if you unloaded a shotgun at it. Even the idea that the movie is based on Hasbro's classic board game of the same name is rather disingenuous: yes, there is a battleship involved in the action, almost all of which takes place at sea, but other than that any resemblance to the game we all grew up playing seems purely coincidental. And I certainly don't remember any aliens in the game I had.",2012
1,"This film broke new ground in mindless, irrational, dumb entertainment. The space aliens fail due to hesitation. A grizzly bear-sized alien in high tech armor is face-to-face with puny humans on several occasions. They throw the humans to the ground (of course, they get up unscathed) and watch the puny humans run away. They are face-to-face with a puny, technologically inferior 70-year-old battleship. They hesitate and wait for the battleship to strike first instead of obliterating it. We have incredible plot holes like: By dropping anchor, a thousand-ton battleship will swerve on a dime (actually, it would take about half an hour). A disabled man who walks with a cane and has artificial legs and a huge stomach can beat up a grizzly bear-size alien in full high tech armor. A geeky guy can hit a grizzly bear-sized alien in high tech armor with a brief case and beat him up. We see giant square blocks with 100 rocket launchers pop up on alien battleships, yet they only fire one or two at a time. The USS Missouri, which is a floating museum, is occupied by a dozen 90-year-old WW2 vets, who quickly spring into action instead of suffering massive heart attacks and strokes. The afore-mentioned 70-year-old battleship was fully equipped with live rounds of ammo. The United States Military was too stupid to attack the alien battleships with aircraft, as they did to the Japanese Navy in WW2. ",2013
1,"The film is so bad it's not worth reviewing honestly. The only redeeming quality was the CGI, but every other aspect was just so predictable and boring. From the very beginning of the film you know its going to be bad. One cliché after another with that generic Top Gun feel, with the lead male character a maverick in the navy. Rihanna is acceptable but appears in parts of the film where you wouldn't expect her to be. The inclusion of the real WW2 veterans was touching, but exposed the poor story line and plot even more. The highlight of absurdity came with the revival of the old battleship from a museum piece to all of a sudden being fully laden with ammo and able to fire up the engines at a moments notice. The adverts for the film gave you an entirely different idea of what was to come. In other words false advertising. This is yet another example of Hollywood relying on CGI and that feeling of being on a roller-coaster at an amusement park. Finally, if it wasn't for the fact that I had to write 10 lines I wouldn't have. As for the film don't bother.",2012

A  deafening, blue and orange military recruitment tool, the film can't  even sustain its laughably simple premise, and attempts to promote a  message so unappealing to its target audience I was left questioning  why it even exists.  Story is the least important element here, so lets just say that in  between all the sweeping helicopter shots and blinding lens flare, an  international Naval war games exercise is interrupted by alien  invaders, and it's up to reckless officer Alex Hopper (Taylor Kitsch)  to save the day. Kitsch delivers solid character work early on, but  soon gets lost in the cacophony of bangs and seizure-inducing editing  which leaves little room for the human story. Inexplicably added to the  mix are pop star Rihanna, seemingly here for no other reason than,  well, she's Rihanna, and Liam Neeson collecting his paycheck for around  10 minutes of screen time. But, as I said, we're not here for the  story, rather the spectacular action and special effects right? The bad  news is that when the aliens finally show up, BATTLESHIP's pace  strangely slows to a crawl (no doubt due to the limited options offered  by the source material), and all potential excitement and interest  evaporates. Director Berg forces the idea of teamwork down the  audience's throats (Japan and the US fighting together in Hawaii?  Wonders never cease), and doesn't even try to disguise his recruitment  agenda. Indeed, the film is little more than a hyperkinetic music video  (oh, that's why Rihanna is here) designed to lure impressionable youth  into signing up so they too can fight the 'alien invaders'.  Herein lies the problem however: young people today almost definitely  don't play Battleship. Basing a tentpole film on a board game seemed  like a daft idea from the outset, but recent cinema history has seen a  theme park ride turned into a critically and financially successful  franchise, so precedent is there in a way. Unfortunately for Universal,  even those of us who grew up in a pre-internet/Xbox Live world remember  Battleship as a desperately boring endeavour, so how can it be expected  to compete in today's short attention-span culture? The strange  metaphor that Berg attempts to craft in the film's third act,  suggesting that we need to remember and re-appraise the past, just  won't fly with 21st century teens bred in our disposable, constantly  updating world of technological wonder. BATTLESHIP's strange  juxtaposition of bombastic special effects framing ancient board game  mechanics simply doesn't sit right, and it's hard to imagine the teen  audience, so crucial for success at the summer box-office, tearing  themselves away from the latest CALL OF DUTY to embrace the turn-based  'excitement' of this ridiculous film. No amount of explosions can  salvage a limp and underwritten movie, and BATTLESHIP, not entirely  unexpectedly, is torpedoed by its own outdated inspiration.",2012
4,"No one was expecting Hollywood would so be s*** out of ideas and turn a board game into a movie but in the end we have BATTLESHIP, a movie based on the classic board game involving taking down your enemy's entire fleet through luck and grid reference. But this one has aliens which were strangely absent in the original source material.",2012
10,"I went into this movie thinking it was going to be cheesy and have some good action in it which is why I go to the movies. I don't go for drama and talking I want to see fighting and lots of craziness. I loved the movie, I love alien invasion movies and to see people on here complaining that the aliens didn't really have any special powers makes me laugh. I mean come on they come from a planet similar to ours so why would they have any special powers? They had a bit better technology then we did and what alien movie doesn't? Also think of all the alien movies we have had so far and what else can be done? You go to the movies to be entertained but I guess some people just can't let themselves go for 2 hours and enjoy whats on the screen because it wasn't written like they would of written it. I liked the aliens HALO type armor they wore and the wrecking ball/drilling metal munching destroying things were the sickness. That was one hell of a way to chew up a ship and spit it out, thought that was great. My kids loved it and my father got choked up over the veterans part. (His father is from that era and fought in Guam) I was just happy to get away from the busy/nasty daily grind we all sometimes endure and let myself go. I wouldn't see it again at the full price but will for sure go to the dollar movies and buy it when it comes out on DVD.",2012
1,"Corny, silly, ridiculous, stupid, pointless, mindless. Probably one of the worst movies this year. Aliens need a signal to get to Earth then they come with explosive weapons and earthly technology and the navy beats the aliens with a battleship. The unlikely but obvious hero marries the beautiful princess, the elderly retirees get their second chance at being heroes, the handicapped soldier also gets a second chance at being a hero and the Japanese marine helps the USA save the world from an alien invasion. The story is weak, predictable and the acting is very mediocre. Liam Neeson has made a custom of choosing bad story lines for his work. It seems as this movie has been paid for by the Navy to lure young mindless people to join their ranks. Distasteful, unpleasant.",2012
7,"It's been a decade since the last MIB film was released. We kind of missed the series even though Men In Black 2 wasn't really that good. In this sequel, it's pretty small and unnecessary but it still has the charms and bright imagination. Great Performances and Solid Visuals. It also has the same tone of the original Men In Black films. It's a wonderful action, adventure movie with non-stop enjoyment.",2012
8,"I am not exactly a Will Smith fan. I think the last Will Smith film I watched and liked was the first ""Men in Black"" film back in 1997. I was surprised to learn that there will be another installment of ""Men in Black"" this year, the third of the series. The second MiB was shown in 2002, and I did not even care to finish that one. Will the ten years between the last episode and this one make a difference? I needed to see that.",2012
7,"A decade away from the movie scene has given the Men In Black series a chance at a fresher, newer perspective. Taking its cue from Shrek Forever After, MIB 3 takes on a tired concept (time travel in this case) if only to acknowledge the failure of its dull sequel and take us back to a different era allowing us to view the franchise from an unsullied angle. The result is a film that returns to its roots and gives audiences the chance to relive much of what they first enjoyed – a smart, sci-fi, buddy comedy that embraces everything weird and wonderful about the unknown universe.",2012
8,"Once again our favorite MIB agents Jay & Kay are battling it out for earth. Quick action, colorful villains, beautifully designed settings and CGI, comic relief in the face of imminent destruction, all those made the first two movies great as well as successful in the box office. Could they better the formula in the face of all the other bad sequels we have been seeing for years? ",2012
8,"It is really hard to believe that it has been 10 years since the last Men in Black film. I have to say that this film was much better than the last film which was really just a regurgitation of the first one. This film had a lot more substance and managed to tie up some loose ends which I really appreciated. I think that this film works in 3D because there is a lot of falling through time, which my niece and nephew loved. I have to give major props to Josh Brolin (younger Agent K) who had the daunting task of portraying an actor portraying a role. Tommy Lee Jones (old Agent K) just basically had to be himself (smile). Josh was totally convincing and did an excellent job imitating Tommy's persona. I liked the introduction of Agent O (Emma Thompson) who had one of the funniest scenes in the film and literally had me laughing out loud. I also liked the fact that a women was in charge of such a prestigious agency. As usual Will Smith (Agent J) came up with very comical explanations of the weird situations that occur during the film. I think that my favorite character in the film is Griffin (Michael Stuhlbarg). He was a psychic who could see into the various futures that could occur if certain things happen. I was a little confused at first, but as the film progressed, I finally got it. I related to this character because I have always believed that you always have at least two doors to open (e.g. you can pick up that piece of paper or not) and whatever you decide to do affects everything else. Okay, enough of philosophy class and back to the film. The one thing about all the Men in Black films is all of the different characters that the visual effect crew create. You have to appreciate the imagination of those folks. I also like to check out the aliens that they are monitoring at the agency, for example in the first one they were monitoring Michael Jackson and Agent J's elementary school teacher. Appropriately in this film you get flashes of Lady Gaga and Justin Bieber (appropriately). I wonder if they have to agree to that? Anyway, this was a very entertaining film and you will be glad that you saw it in 3D. I give this film an out-of-this-world green light. Enjoy!!!",2012
7,"Well, whaddaya know, the ""MiB"" have gone MiA for 10 years already! No wonder many of us have forgotten about them as Men In Cape and Bodysuits (aka The Avengers, Batman, Spider-Man, et al) have been hogging the cinemas while the ""Men In Black"" go missing-in-action. No matter, they are still a barrel of fun in this three-quel that comes as more of a surprise than a treat that we have been waiting for.",2012
7,"The original MEN IN BLACK was awesome. I remember watching it and hoping it became a continuing franchise. Then MEN IN BLACK II came out and I took it all back. What a bomb. I can't say I was all that disappointed when it looked like the second movie might've killed the franchise. If that was the sort of movies they were going to put out, let the franchise die before it got any worse. Surprised doesn't even begin to describe my reaction when I found out they were making a third movie. It had been ten years since the second movie. It seemed a little late to go diving back into that well, but whatever. Ten years should be enough time to get a story right. I guess it wasn't though, because I'd read that the script wasn't even complete when they started shooting MEN IN BLACK 3. It wasn't a good sign. I guess there were a lot of problems during production, so I didn't get my hopes up. Regardless, I was hoping this movie might reinvigorate the series. The third film returns to Agents J and K doing their MiB routine. When K fails to show any form of emotion at Agent Zed's funeral, J begins to question just what happened to turn K into the cold man his is now. He'll get his chance when a criminal from K's past, Boris the Animal, breaks out of prison and travels to 1969 to kill K and negate Earth's orbital protection system. To save K's life and prevent an Earth invasion, J must travel back in time to save the future.",2013
7,"The criminal Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement) escapes from the LunaMax, a moon-based maximum security prison.

Boris is defeated again and he travels back in time to 1969 to kill Agent K.",2012
9,"I have been a fan of the Men in Black movies since the original released in 1997. When MIB-II was finally out in 2002, I wondered why it took so long as Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith seemed to work so well together, and their characters had that just right mix of complementing but contradicting personalities.",2012
6,"Although MIB3 wasn't necessarily a 'bad' movie, it certainly wasn't as good as it could have been. It seemed, while watching the marketing plugs, like they were going to bring the big guns and bring back all the funny stuff and cool special effects, but they just fell short. The original was quite good -- Funny, a little scary, cool characters, good stunts, very original. Part II was just bad. So, if you are going to wait 10 years to do a three-quel that nobody really was dying to see because part 2 was so bad, then you better make part 3 REALLY good -- Right? ",2012
8,"It was 1997 when Men in Black first burst onto the big screen featuring a successful pairing of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones as unlikely partners in the protection of Earth against the scum of the universe, with action, special effects and generous doses of comedy rolled into one. Directed by Barry Sonnenfield, they returned five years later for a sequel, and chances for a third film got hovered around for the longest time, finally taking up to a decade before it materialized, taking advantage of the needless 3D format to deliver the latest installment of the popular series.",2012
8,"The Man in Men in Black 3 should've gone back in time to erase Part II, instead.",2013
7,"Will smith nailed the part as agent k. he was very funny and he seemed to really connect as his character. this movie over has a good story plot, doesn't look cheese and was well executed. the movie is about Agent K as will smith went back in time to save his partner Agent K from Boris the animal. Bris wanted revenge from agent k for putting him in prison for 40 years. there also Griffin an alien who has the power to see multiple futures simultaneously. he helped save the world by making the arc net. that has the ability to stop Boris species from entering earth. in the end Agent k saved his partner agent K and in the result his dad died and became a hero.",2013
8,I am gonna say it... This film is as good as the first one.,2013
6,"While this film isn't very popular among critics I found it to be reasonably entertaining but completely forgettable. In fact, I have watched it a few months ago and I barely remember the plot now. Overall, I found it a solid film for the crowds. Solid entertainment for the masses. It doesn't reach the heights of the first film (which weren't that high) but it doesn't fall as low as MIB 2, which sucked, big time. This one is more solid and well executed.",2012
5,"Interesting enough as time travel with aliens movie but not really enough good ideas and does not contain much novel material. What a film that is supposed to be about CGI spectacle and strange aliens has to be fancy ar**ed about sixties cultural references - lord only knows. The plot revolves around 'The Terminator', eg Will Smith has to go back in time to prevent the Tommy Lee Jones characte being killed by his arch nemesis Boris, who has escaped top security jail on the Moon! The Boris character is not played by Tim Curry but nevertheless is way over the top but not truly original or menacing enough. Most of it is a conventional 'Let's save the Earth from a Napoleon-complex mega baddie.' And it is terribly thin on spectacle as it arcs its way to the final showdown at Cape Canaveral. Good jokes for adults and an excellent lookalike and soundalike performance by Josh Brolin as the young Tommy Lee Jones, but film wastes 3D - and the price at the Odeon Putney was a total rip off - £10!!!!!! Not good enough by half.",2012
3,"I giggled a few times. i think I wanted to giggle. I liked MIB. i liked the music, I liked the wit, the style, the fun premise that had always been there as an undercurrent in serious conspiracy films and nutty urban legends but never fully explored. i liked the hard drinking alien worms, the little witty twists- universes inside universes, the common sense street-cop who wins out against educated morons.

Emma Thompson will play take-charge MIB operative Agent Oh, who is monitoring a prison breakout.",2012
7,"In 1997, the first Men in Black came out. It was something no one had ever seen before: a sci-fi movie crossed with the buddy comedy and action genres? To this day it remains one of my personal favorite movies. However, I was disappointed with its sequel, Men in Black II. The film felt like a almost a carbon copy of the original. Ten years later, we have Men in Black III. It's quite a surprise to see this franchise after it was pretty much left for dead. But is it any good? Yes it is. Men in Black III is a fun movie, a cool and nostalgic trip down memory lane. It's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but it's still a blast.",2012
2,"Essentially a third rate comedy dressed up with boring and excessive special effects, this one is about half as good as a Three Stooges short subject. Lots of big dollars squandered in order to jack the price up to the reported $17.50 price. We paid $8.25 and saw it in 2D; just fine.",2012
2,This has to be Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jone's worst movies. The jokes are not funny at all. The enemy or the arch nemesis is a joke and I wasn't sure if he was supposed to be funny of if he was just goofy. There are a few laughs here and there although the movie goes through about 1 hour with nothing happening. It is just people talking here and there.,2012
3,"Ending was good, beginning good. The hour and twenty minutes in the middle dragged on and on and I was drinking caffeine.And I cant believe I have to give a review of 10 lines what else is there to say. Don't waste your money. The theater had 10 people in it on opening weekend. Tommy Lee looked very old in the movie. The jokes were just not funny. The review by Debby Does Politics of 3 Reagan's is ludicrous. At most 1 Reagan! She usually does a good job about here reviews. Now I'm just adding filler to this review to make it 10 lines long; but that's exactly what the movie did to make it 2 hours long; add filler and more filler. There were times when the actors just stared at each other and this is supposed to be entertainment? Please.",2012
1,We loved parts I and II and it was enough. Right now we will not watch them anymore. Part III killed all our love. If you cannot make a good part III do not do it at all. We were in anticipation to see a great entertaining show... Man in Black!!! IMAX 3D!!! It turns to be extremely boring! Dialogs about nothing. Repulsive looking fortune teller in an idiotic baby cap and etc. Just waste of time and money. Best part is funny speech on the alien language of the agent O and the first scene with security staff in the Canaveral Space Center. My dad asked: How come all these great actors agreed to play in such a bad movie? My dad thought that actors can choose what to play in the US. We are done with Spielberg and director Barry Sonnenfeld.,2012
5,"Let's just get this out of the way: Josh Brolin's portrayal of a young Tommy Lee Jones is freakishly good. It's one of the most amusing performances of 2012 so far. It's disappointing then that the film around him – which appears to have felt the effects of its well known production issues – is hit and miss at best, cringe-worthy at worst. The CGI is often horrible, Jemaine Clement's villain is underwhelming and Hollywood stalwarts Jones and Emma Thomson are criminally underused. However, there's still enough here to recommend for Dad's and sons looking for some female-free time. Will Smith is clearly relishing the opportunity to play Agent J for the third time and he slots back into ultra-cool, jive-talking mode like a second skin. A handful of the gags work too, most of them stemming from the fish-out-of-water premise having Agent J return to the sixties. Oh, and did I mention that Brolin is amazing? He's almost worth the price of admission alone. Almost.",2012

1,"I love The Incredibles, Up, Shrek, Toy Story, Monsters Inc., Despicable Me and Megeaman. I thought I was going to see something that amazing, but with a female protagonist. But no. It was the same old Disney princess movie: a princess having problems about who she is or is not going to marry. We saw that in Snow White, Seeping Beauty, Cinderella, The Little Mermaid. Apparently, that all females ever do: fret about who they are going to marry.",2012
4,"Pixar execs used to say that the story was indispensable in their filmmaking. They were right. It is too bad they didn't follow their own advice in making Brave. As a formulaic Disney movie, it would be average (though with above average visuals). But our family (kids' ages from 10 to 18) doesn't bother seeing formulaic Disney movies anymore. We saw it yesterday, and everyone was disappointed. ""Cliche,"" one of our children said. ""Easily the worst Pixar movie I've ever seen,"" said another (though none of us has seen Cars 2). I chuckled once.",2012
3,I felt compelled to write a review to counter all the excellent reviews that this movie has received.,2012
4,"Mix Brother Bear with almost any princess film and this is what you get. The characters (surprisingly for Pixar) were poorly developed; this is especially true for the mother, where I was expecting some kind of back story, or at least a more believable development of the mother-daughter relationship. But no, apparently you're best buddies again and the mother will just change her mind on everything she believed previously, through a single fish-catching montage. ...Really? And don't get me started on 'the bad guy'. This 'evil bear' appears in only two scenes - one in which they escape from him, and one in which he returns and then gets squashed by a rock. In fact, the story would have been almost identical had the 'bad guy' been cut out of the script entirely.",2012
3,"Animation is spectacular, great setting in the Scottish Highlands. Voice acting is above par. However, this movie is not among the top Pixar films, by far.

3,"This movie is definitely for women in general. A young girl coming of age is told she must have a suitor and get married. She's a tomboy and wants to do her own thing and her mother and father want the opposite - that's about it . The rest of the movie is filled with low brow humor , typical slapstick violence and the usual moral of the story ending. After seeing the trailer and the movie poster ,one would think Brave would be about this young girl fighting and winning battles with her bow and arrow and a rousing adventure. Instead it's a dull boring coming of age story with not much to give except for the kids who like to watch cartoon bears and other creatures frolic around the woods and moms raising their bratty teenage daughters. 3/10 .",2012

Instead of the usual montage summing up the entire movie, or at least half of it, we get one scene: an assertive tomboy princess with neat looking fiery red hair shoots an arrow to choose her own fate instead of a bunch of losers vying to marry her: the one that hits the bulls eye wins her hand in marriage. (Let's make it clear, all three young men are pathetic wrecks: if one resembled an Elfin Johnny Depp with half a brain, perhaps there'd be no story at all.) After our frustrated heroine, Princess Merida, hits all the marks by herself, the real tale begins – and not only is it strange, awkward and confusing, but even the target-audience children might shake their heads in disbelief.",2012

The visual effects are flawless, in my opinion, the best if all Pixar films.",2012

While this cliché'd line seems to reflect the simple plot in most movies (while the moral outcome does, too), the setting makes Wreck-it Ralph a wonderful, refreshing, and unique pleasure. Inside a family arcade, all the game characters (both old and new) are real, and travel among the other games when the doors have locked.

Because he doesn't like being a bad guy, he goes into some of the video games in order to learn what it's like to become a good guy.

So, he goes to Hero's Duty and Sugar Rush where there he meets a girl named Vannellope and makes a friendship with her as she tries to win a race so she can become a racer before they make a deal to win and give Ralph a medal.

9,"The trailer alone, garnered much buzz for Disney's latest 3D adventure. Seeing some of'the great video game villains of all time assembled in one room was just too good to be true. The hype was elevated to even greater heights given its ubiquitous presence at San Diego Comic Con. In the back of mind I kept thinking, ""THEY'RE GONNA WRECK IT!""",2012
10,"The Short: Wreck-It Ralph is a classic. From the slick animation, the great sense of humor, nostalgia inducing references and cameos, and the surprisingly adept and emotional story, Disney's Wreck-it Ralph is the best animated comedy since Tangled, and one of Disney's best animated films ever crafted.",2012
7,"With a mix of ""Alien,"" ""Toy Story"" and a bit of originality, Walt Disney Studios has created a wonderfully fun and nostalgic effort sure to put a smile on the faces of young and old, alike.",2012
10,OK OK I get it.,2017
10,"Since the release of its very first trailer, a long time ago, Wreck it Ralph has always appeared as one of the most promising animated flicks of the year. Having seen the movie, I have changed my mind: It's not just one of the best animated movies, it's one of the best movies (or maybe the best) of the year. ",2012
10,"I think 2012 has been a very good, even great, year for animation in that I don't think I have seen an animated film I've disliked. Wreck It Ralph for me was the best animated film from 2012(although it only came out yesterday in the UK I still class it as a 2012 film), tying with Tangled as the best Disney has done since The Hunchback of Notre Dame. It has something for children and adults alike, and I don't think you have to be a video game fan to like it(I'm not exactly, more of Disney myself, but am very familiar with them through my brother). The animation is wonderful, the characters move with no problem at all, the colours look gorgeous and the backgrounds are detailed, very like the very best of Pixar actually. The music, right from the tempos, rhythms, melodies, chord progressions and instrumentation, is full of energy and the songs are incredibly catchy. The writing is a perfect blend of humour and heart, the film is often hilarious and witty as well as heartfelt and touching in equal measures and the story is fast-paced and much more original than you'd think complete with energetic-but not too frantic- action. I like the Be Youself message, it is an important one and I personally didn't think it was heavy-handed. And of course any video game fan will love spotting the video game characters and references, there's plenty of them and all are colourfully evoked. I found it very easy to relate to Ralph, Fix-it Felix Jr is an amusing character and Vanellope is cute without being annoying or mawkish. The voice work is terrific, with the standout being the gruff vulnerability that John C Reilly brings to Ralph. In conclusion, a wonderful film and the best animated film of the year. 10/10 Bethany Cox",2013
10,"Hey, wait a minute there! How come no one has had the idea of bringing the fantasy universe of video games into the big screen? I do not remember anyone having done this before ... ah ... except, of course, by TRON. Coincidence or not, also produced by Disney. Many people do not know, but Disney was a pioneer in computer graphics in the film industry. And now, under the general direction of John Lasseter (Pixar former), Disney keeps the tradition on creating some of the most magical moments in animated films or even in films regarded as traditional. ""Tron Legacy"" was an example of this latest kind. Perhaps a misunderstood work , is one of those unforgettable movies , in every aspect, especially for those who like CG, games, great music, a dazzling visual and an engaging story. Another recent product, this time already connecting x Disney Pixar was ""John Carter."" Directed by excellent Andrew Stanton , this film was also misunderstood by the general public. Unfortunately, it was poorly worked by Disney marketing people and the general public did not understand the overall proposal. Well .. Now we have ""Wreck-it Ralph."" I must confess ... I cried while watching this movie. That's right! So even as I cried in ""Up!"" or ""Wall-e"". These works come from different teams, but all have the same background: poetry. The look of this film is stunning. Colors, details, the overall creativity... are all very touching. The references to the world of video games are priceless! And what about that cute little girl? Well, I would like to summarize this movie as ""magic"". It belongs to that realm of fantasy and delight of magic, that kind of magic that makes you leave the theater with a light spirit, and happy and relaxed. A bit like Toy Story 3, ""Wreck-it Ralph"" is about the recognition of each individual's position in the universe and, of course, about friendship. I recommend this movie. At least for those who still insist on dreaming on and on.",2013
7,"I did not really plan to watch ""Wreck It Ralph"" at all because I do not really like the recent Disney output. I am unfamiliar with the characters and the title and poster did not look attractive to me. However, with consistently good word-of-mouth reviews, I felt I had to give it a shot. And yes, ""Wreck It Ralph"" deserves its good reputation, and I am glad I got to see it.",2012
10,"When I first watched trailers for this movie, I was completely surprised that Disney was making something like this. I personally thought this would be something Pixar would make instead. I also wondered how much money Disney would have to give video game companies like Nintendo to use Bowser in their film. I thought I would like it, but it wouldn't crack my top 10 Disney films. I was wrong. I went to see this movie, and I was blown away. This film taught a very good lesson: To be yourself, and to think of others. Ralph is a villain in an arcade game, and he wants to be a good guy, and respected by others, thus starting his journey through other games trying to earn a medal to do so. At the end (spoilers here) he actually remains the villain, but people respect him more, since he helped a little girl in a racing game rise again to glory. He stays as a villain, but isn't treated like the garbage he once lived in since he showed he can be a hero, and a nice guy. He learns to be himself, and people will respect him. The others realized it, and learned from their mistake. That is powerful. But the thing I like most about the film is the comedy. I've seen funny Disney films, like Aladdin, Great Mouse Detective, and The Emperor's New Groove, but when it comes to comedy, this film takes the cake. ""You wouldn't hit a guy with glasses, would you?"" *Ralph takes off the King's glasses and hits him with them* You hit me with glasses. Well played."" Hilarious. The people in the theater were constantly laughing throughout the entire film, as was I. Personally, my only problem with the film is one thing with the villain. Not the villain as a whole, just one part. He's the king of a racing game, and he deletes the file and memory of Penelope, the ACTUAL ruler of the place, so he can be king and she wouldn't interfere. That part is genius, but here's one thing I don't like about him. Apparently, he was actually a virus in another racing game, but they don't explain that until the end of the film. They don't explain that he deleted her file and memory until the end too. You only know that for about 10 minutes of the film (or something like that) until the king is defeated, so this was really forced. However, it is actually a good cause, because one thing I like about the villain is how subtle he is. There's one part (you don't know the king deleted her file yet) where he explains to Ralph why she can't race, and the fact that she is now a glitch makes her unavailable to leave that game, and if someone played it, they would think the game is busted, thus the plug gets pulled and she would die. He makes you feel that he's actually a good guy, and cares for her. I like that a lot. Anyway, outside of my one problem with the villain, this film was excellent. One of the best of the year, and I plan on seeing it again.",2012

10,"I liked it! I liked it so much I'm going to buy it on DVD, heck even the extended DVD.",2013
9,"A large part of the movie's success was is due to its tribute to the classical video games, and how accurately it captured the essence of each type of video game while also making them original. Disney studio revisits the 8-bit graphics used in 1820s video games, such as Donkey Kong. The characters from retro games continue to move in the jerky 8-bit movement even when the animation switches back to the modern high definition graphics. The 80s avatars also speak in the particular language from that time period. Specifically, Felix frequently exclaims antiquated expressions like ""That's just the honey glow in my cheeks!"" Such minutia evokes a nostalgic feeling.",2013
7,"I didn't even know this movie existed until I got an email about a private screening. I went just because I didn't have anything to do and didn't expect much. Anything with Sylvester Stallone is guaranteed to be your run of the mill, cheesy, action flick with guns, explosions and cheesy one liners. This is exactly what this movie was but this time I enjoyed it from start to finish.",2013
7,"In case you can't discern from the title, this is a *very* violent film, so don't be a putz and take your five or six year old kid, like a couple of people did at the Independence, Missouri AMC screening tonight. There are more triple-taps to the head than any film in recent memory, to the point that it becomes rather over the top by the time the film ends All that said, Walter Hill has woven yet another well-paced, engrossing buddy film actioner with a pretty good left hand twist. Stallone plays a weary New Orleans hit-man very convincingly, and with a very wry sense of humor. Were he any more droll, he would have to become a British citizen.",2013

6,"Now i'll admit I'm an action junkie and almost all the movies I review are in this genre. So with that in mind I'm an obvious fan of Stallone and Walter Hill. If you are also you'll like this as he one lines, punches, shoots, explodes and stabs his way through this film. Now the plot is very cliché and predictable which is why I would give it a 6. ",2013
7,"In New Orleans, the hit men James Bonomo (Sylvester Stallone), a.k.a. Jimmy Bobo, and Louis Blanchard (Jon Seda) execute the dirty cop Hank Greely (Holt McCallany) in a hotel room. But they are betrayed and Louis is stabbed in a bar by the mercenary Keegan (Jason Momoa) while waiting for the payment of the contract. Meanwhile the Washington D.C. police detective Taylor Kwon (Sung Kang) comes to New Orleans to investigate the murder of Greely, who had stolen evidences from the Police Department. Soon he is shot by two dirty detectives but Jimmy saves his life. Jimmy brings Taylor to the shop of his daughter Lisa (Sarah Shahi) and she removes the bullet from his shoulder and nurses him. Taylor and Jimmy form the most unlikely partnership to investigate the crimes and after contacting the intermediate Ronnie Earl (Brian Van Holt) that had hired Jimmy and Louis, they discover a network of corruption formed by the lawyer Marcus Baptiste (Christian Slater) and the entrepreneur Robert Nkomo Morel (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje).",2013
6,"This movie plays out exactly like a video game, complete with a Blackberry that feeds objectives and information. The bad guys give up info way too easy. Sung Gang is wooden and completely cliché for the good cop role. ",2013
8,"I'd start this review off with a strong ""Sylvester Stallone is back,"" but it's just not true. He's very much been in the limelight recently. The 67-year old actor won't be held down by his age. After a 3-year hiatus back in 2003, he returned to the ring by acting in and directing ""Rocky Balboa."" Not content to just re-visit one of his most well-known characters, Stallone also put the headband back on for a fourth helping of ""First Blood"" in ""Rambo.""",2013
7,"All the ads for ""Bullet to the Head"" bear the name and image of Sylvester Stallone, an actor who is perfectly at home in this sort of picture: a violent shoot-'em-up with a rogue gun-for-hire working with and against a straight-shooting cop. But, as far as I am concerned, there should be a second name plastered right alongside Mr. Stallone's. The extra credit is not, ironically enough, for the Korean actor Sung Kang, even though he is very good, but instead the film's director. I walked into ""Bullet to the Head"" with an open mind, hoping that Mr. Stallone could keep up the good track record he's had in the last couple of years (the last ""Rambo"" and both of the ""Expendables"" movies), but when I saw the words 'directed by Walter Hill' in the opening credits, I knew I was in for a good time.",2013

6,"2013 has already brought back two of the coolest, if not the coolest action heroes: Schwarzenegger and now Stallone. The funny thing about it all is that Stallone already had his returning movie last year with the Expendables 2 as it mainly focused around him. Anyways, the trailer to the movie, as many may have said, looked absolutely horrible and I didn't really have any intention of seeing this, despite Stallone being my second favorite action star. Now, I'm kinda glad I saw it The film is based around Stallone's character James who is on a rampage to avenge the death of his fellow partner who was killed. Now the story line has been done to death but there is an alliance formed which was kinda cool. The most important thing about this movie is that it isn't trying to take the story far too seriously but keeps it important and is actually very good if you look at it.",2013
7,With this movie Stallone is back and in surprisingly good shape. That is a good thing since the enjoyment of this movie is pretty much Stallone and not much else. If you are not a Stallone fan you are most likely not going to enjoy this movie.,2013
3,"If you want to see a 90 minute advertisement for the Blackberry phone, then this film is right up your street. The product placement is so obvious and in your face, that it feels like Kwon's phone is a third main character. It should probably get an Oscar for its performance. Jimi and Kwon need to find a suspect: Kwon googles on his BB. They need some information about another suspect: Kwon phones the office and has it all sent to his BB. Is that a bad guy doing something that will prove that Kwon was right all along? Film it on the BB. Jimi doesn't believe Kwon that his phone is the best thing since sliced bread: download everything there is to know about Jimi and show him. It just really grated on me.",2013

9,"Bullet to the Head is about as 80's as you're going to get, but personally I think that is a good thing especially with today in cinema.

8,"A RedBox rental that I found very enjoyable. It's about a hit-man who after losing his partner goes after the origination that set the men up, but Stallone isn't alone. He is joined by a cop who is put on probation (for no reason) but not wanting to stop his investigation he joins Stallone but they are not on the same path (one is with the law, and one isn't). In my opinion this is an okay film that if you are an action fan to go and pick up for a rental. As a Stallone fan though, you need to get this film and keep it next to Rambo and The Expendables. My issues with the film are some weird camera angles/ movements and some flashback sequences. In conclusion watch the film and then question if you wanna keep it or not.",2013
8,"I am a big fan of both Stallone and director Walter Hill, so I have been excited about this for awhile now . I am not disappointed .By reading some of these negative user reviews, it is obvious they either hate action movies or expect more from this than it needs to deliver . Whether you love it or hate it, at least do so for what it is , a straight up action picture.Bullet To The Head is very similar to 48 Hours and Red Heat , also made by Hill and is also fast paced, violent and funny. This won't get any awards, but the film is well made and the performances from the actors are good enough to move the story between the action scenes. The action is brutal and my main man Sly gives one of his toughest , most badass performances to date. Even though this is'nt doing well at the box office , Bullet To The Head will find its audience and most likely achieve cult status . If you enjoy old school action classics like 48 Hours and Cobra , you will most likely dig this as Bullet .. is both entertaining and well made",2013
10,"Watching the Sylvester Stallone shoot'em up ""Bullet to the Head"" felt like a blast from the past. This polished but predictable anthology of action movie clichés contains several R-rated, close-quarters, combat scenes with sufficient amounts of blood splatter and gore; some high-octane, fireball explosions; lots of snappy tough guy banter; and surprising displays of frontal female nudity. Half the scenes reminded me of producer Joel Silver's explosive, slam-bang, white-knuckled, testosterone-laden tales, such as ""Conspiracy Theory,"" ""Exit Wounds, ""Swordfish,"" and his ""Lethal Weapon"" franchise. Indeed, Silver serves as one of the producers, and ""Bullet to the Head"" adheres to his formula. Meanwhile, action auteur Walter Hill drew the other half from his hardboiled melodramas. For the record, Hill helmed the two ""48 Hrs"" flicks with Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy, ""Extreme Prejudice"" with Nick Nolte, ""Last Man Standing"" with Bruce Willis, and ""Red Heat"" co-starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Belushi. Although ""The Messenger"" scenarist Alessandro Camon adapted the Alexis Nolent graphic novel ""Du plomb dans la tête,"" ""Bullet to the Head"" looks like ""48 Hrs"" and/or ""Red Heat"" clone. Mind you, ""Bullet to the Head"" is Hill's first theatrical release since his gritty 2002 prison melodrama ""Undisputed"" with Ving Rhames and Wesley Snipes. During his absence from the big screen, Hill helmed the premiere episode of HBO's ""Deadwood,"" and then the television mini-series western ""Broken Trail"" (2006) costarring Robert Duvall and Thomas Haden Church."" In many respects, this action-packed, largely straightforward, odd couple buddy picture compares favorably with earlier, exceptional Stallone sagas like ""Assassins,"" ""The Specialist,"" and ""Demolition Man."" Most definitely, it surpasses ""Tango and Cash"" and ""Stop, Or My Mom Will Shoot."" ",2013
4,"n the 1970s and 80s, Sylvester Stallone and director Walter Hill dominated the cinematic scene with various action films and buddy comedies. Their latest film, Bullet to the Head, attempts to recapture the spirit of the 80s but ends up feeling outdated, never attempting to reinvent or modernise this type of film.",2013
8,"Sly is still as good as ever in this fast paced action movie. The editing brings with it a 90s 'made for TV' style of storytelling. What I mean by that is; the continuity is at a neutral speed with an emphasis on wide camera shots accompanying little soundtrack scoring. An all around great cast of actors, nice to see Christian Slater in something watchable for a change. Triple A's character was awesome, and although Momoa gets type cast as the stereotypical big-man, he pulled off an entertaining performance. ",2013
4,"The only good thing about this otherwise bland collection of clichés and flat writing is Jason Momoa as the villain. He showed spark and verve and might as well have been in another, better, movie altogether. Seriously, don't waste your time, there is nothing in this film that is surprising or worthwhile except the all-too-brief moments when Jason Momoa is on-screen, playing a heavy with his own sense of honor, conveying a lot with a quirked smile. Stallone looks terrible, moves stiffly, the Korean-American actor is completely implausible, and even the usually compelling Sarah Shahi is little more than eye-candy. Walter Hill, where have you gone? You gave us Long Riders, among many good works, and now you deliver this dreck?",2013
3,"That's right. I have no idea what else could have happened to make Stallone to make such movie after the great Expendables II. This movie is so bad that it makes me wanna watch Hard Ticket to Hawaii again. The plot is so simple that it's not worth mentioning. Everything else about this movie is just cheap. Visuals, audio, effects, acting, everything. Sung Kang made me feel like I am watching a talent show dropout. You know the really bad movies, when you see cut, then the actor hesitates a while and then the action starts? Yup, that's how he acts here. The last scene in the bar made the movie centre in my brain implode. I want the 90 minutes of my life back!",2013
2,"The success or failure of this movie was almost entirely dependent on the relationship that develops between the Stallone character and the Kang character. The complete botching of this element of the film, with childlike acting, poor dialog, and completely unbelievable premise, doomed this film to ""bomb"" status.",2013
1,"OMG.....What audience is this movie made for? My Great-Grandpa?? Watching Sylvester Stalone trying to be exciting is absolutely painful. I actually took my Dad to see it, for his birthday.

5,This movie literally could have been made in the 80's.,2013
7,"I can't understand the negative reviews, I enjoyed the first episode and found it demanding of my attention (I watched on HULU while doing other tasks... or not doing them, because, as I said, it grabbed my attention). The acting in this show is quite a bit better than most CW offerings, and Jay Ryan is well cast as Vincent. IMHO, and Kristen Kreuk's personality aside (I don't see how it has anything to do with the quality of the show, as actors are notoriously self absorbed, so I think the hit piece published above is irrelevant and I'm surprised it was approved) I find Kreuk's performance to be just the right combination of tough exterior with fragile insides. So far as the story is concerned, it's off to a bit of a slow start, but it's not uncommon for a good or even great show to take some time to build it's world. This will take a bit of time as the writers seem very focused on establishing the two main characters and their relationship to each other. I was also impressed that the action sequences did not dominate the show. They were short, well done and added to the story instead of hiding any flaws. This one I'll be giving a few episodes to see how well it builds.",2012
9,"I wanted to start by saying, I've never watched a pilot more than once in the same week but with this show, I did. When the second episode aired, there were bits that were bothersome to me and I wasn't quite sure where it was going. However, after watching the third episode, I finally get to see where it's headed and I absolutely love it. I think everyone should give this series a chance and if you don't like it, that's fine but I can't say this show is similar to anything else on TV. I love how different it is and the entertainment factor is through the roof. The chemistry between characters is excellent and the acting is up to par. This is most definitely a show I'll be following!",2012
5,"Some people are panning this because it's based on the 80s version. I've never seen the 80s version and I'm sure there are differences, but it's like the book vs the movie...it's not going to be the exact same show. This is the CW, a network with The Vampire Diaries and Supernatural. This isn't Homeland and it's not going to win an Emmy, but f you go in to it with an open mind and let it stand on it's own, it definitely delivers. The two leads have great chemistry and yes the 'beast' is a hottie, but he morphs in to a Beast in anger. He looks the part, he saves the girl and they work together with romance brewing between them. He can't have human contact and she doesn't recoil from him. The cop part of the show is also pretty good (I say pretty good, because I'm not a huge cop-show fan) and it's interwoven well with their interactions. Give it a shot. I didn't think I was going to like it, after last year's Secret Circle, but I do. Do yourself a favor and don't listen to the cynics who want a complete rehash of the original. Great!",2012
10,"I was a die hard fan of the B&TB of the 80s and I feel this show is awesome IF, and only if, one stops comparing it with the original and give this show a chance. I think CW should have given the show a different name as well as the main characters because it gave a certain level of expectation to die hard fans. Some people were disappointed, others were not (like me). The only stand out similarities are the title of the show and the names of the main characters (Catherine and Vincent). Other than that, this show is a different take and should not be compared to the original. The original had ""heavy"" and ""deep"" material. Heck! Real life nowadays is already heavy and deep. If I wanted heavy and deep, I would watch the news or read the newspaper, etc. I want to mentally ""escape"" from real life for a few hours. So, I tune in, sit back and be entertained. I recall another show (about two vampire brothers in love with one woman) that initially had many negative reviews in its first season (mostly because the TV version was vastly different from the books). Now, that show has a cult following. Give B&TB a chance...give yourself a chance to have some fun.",2012
9,"I really like the idea of a Beauty more determined and more ready to kick some b...in the quest for the truth. It is a different concept and a different Vincent. I truly don't get it how can one review a TV show after such a short while. Clearly some of us need to be patient. They will fall in love...I mean you have to be blind not to notice the chemistry ( she is obviously extremely attracted to him and vice versa)but where will be the fun if he would jump her bones in the first episodes? Also , the obvious adrenaline issue ( he turns when it kicks in) which was so carefully underlined by his friend -"" Remember what happened the last time you made the play list?"" - will most likely be in the way.",2012
10,"This is by far my favorite TV show of the year. I absolutely love the way in which the storyline is developing, and the growing chemistry between Vincent and Catherine. In my opinion, there is something really special and unique about this show. The acting is excellent, and each character is strong. J.T. and Vargas bring some lighter comic relief, and they are great supporting characters for Vincent and Catherine. So far, we are around half way through the first season, and every episode has managed to be consistently good and entertaining from start to finish. My friends in the UK are already really looking forward to watching Beauty and the Beast when it gets aired over there in January. The Beast is a different type of beast than in previous movies and shows of the same name, and I think it fits in really well with the new modernized setting. I'm intrigued to see which direction the writers intend to take the show, and I look forward to each new episode!",2012

Can not wait for the next episode!!I definitely recommend you guys check this out and see what Im talking about. Maybe you don't completely fall in love with the first episode but by the second Im sure you will be hooked! The actor that plays the beast is extremely good looking also!,2012
10,"I watched all of the episodes of the original series and truthfully by its end I had grown bored. So the dialog of this show may seem silly to some or maybe the plot unbelievable to others, but for a fan like me of sci-fi and supernatural based shows, this is more refreshing than watch yet another drab crime drama, medical drama, court room drama, etc type show that parades the airwaves every night. Regardless of how long this show lasts, I'll continue to watch it and enjoy it like I did The Secret Circle. Like that show, it has good special effects, a nice looking cast, and something that seems more exciting than seeing two people try to figure out every single show the murder of the week or the crime of the week.",2012

There seems to be a lot of different people with different issues and mysteries to solve. There's a cross between protecting a victim and the law, it's complicated. It's a lot of excellent writing, producing, directing and acting. There's substance to this show, more substance than the typical. I also think the characters are varied and I like the connection between Beauty and the Beast. She is so beautiful and he is handsome - it's a complicated relationship that is not boring!

10,"I loved it, before it even started, Im a fan of Kristin and liked the concept, never watched the original version, called me shallow but I rather stick with this Vincent than Perlman's, also the chemistry and the plot in every episode is likable, Im not a huge fan of any cop, lawyers, detective kind of series but I like this one because it has it all.",2012
10,"I do not understand the reasoning behind all of the bad reviews. Try watching more than just the pilot. This show is exciting, sexy, and just overall satisfying. Each character's story has been developing as the season continues on. There are comical scenes that help break up all the intense action. Even the actors cast for the ""beauty"" and the ""beast"" parts are perfect. Jay Bunyan is gorgeous. I envy his affection towards Kristin Kreuk; they are a perfect match. The shy dark disposition of Jay is sexy. I also like how Kristin kicks a** at fighting. Every time he shows up randomly, surprising her my heart jumps. I cannot wait until they officially get together. So, as this show continues I will be happy to find out whether or not Jay gets captured or if Kristen and him are able to be together without it having to be a secret. I definitely will continue to watch this show! I hope others are able to enjoy this show",2012
10,"I like the show very much, did not expect to be that good and the idea for the hidden beast and the nowadays prospective and creativity of the world both of the protagonists live in.I enjoyed the first episode and found it demanding of my attention while doing other tasks.. The acting in this show is quite a bit better than most CW offerings, and Jay Ryan is well cast as Vincent., and Kristen Kreuk's personality and game are good enough I find Kreuk's performance better than in Smallville and Ryan 's appearance is the best choice made for the Beast. Impatient to see what will happen with Vincent and Catherine. Want to watch it every day over and over. Its the best show i ever seen from these days.",2012

1,Beauty & the Beast Pilot review,2012
4,"Perhaps in an attempt to modernize the plot and make it more accessible to a contemporary audience, ""Beauty and the Beast"" has been stripped of its characteristic sense of wonder and fantasy. Unlike the original character, Victor is not forced to live in solitude by his appearance. This updated version is more like the ""wessen"" of Grimm, in that his mutation is only expressed under certain circumstances, but Victor looks more like one of the cartoonish vampires from ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" than any sort of beast.",2012
8,"I am a fan of Kristin Kreuk, but i will make this review as neutral as possible.",2012
6,"The creator of this series is the same creator of the 1980s version, with Linda Hamilton and Ron Perlman. For that reason I was disappointed to see a simplified version of the original, totally missing the community-oriented underworld (beneath the city) in which Vincent and a number of other outcasts lived. Somehow I hope this is forthcoming in this show, as this was part of its intrigue. It's worth mentioning that Kristin Kreuk is well-cast and does a good job as the lead character. The Vincent character (not the actor) is a little boring. I hope the show will develop more depth over time and bring a new angle to some of the elements of the 1980s version that created such a strong following.",2012
4,The problem with the premise is that if they make the beast too ugly then there just can't be any romance. So they haven't made him too beastly. The problem with that is here the beast is more like someone with a bad temper from post traumatic stress disorder after a bad tour of duty. Jay Ryan is a bit generic looking and doesn't have enough beast in him. He isn't even as beastly as some Vampire Diaries creatures.,2012
10,"I'm a massive Kristin Kreuk fan, and since the beginning of 2012 when all these fairytale movies were being made and coming out I thought they needed to make a Beauty and the Beast where Kristin would play as Beauty. There isn't another person who I think is more beautiful inside and out that would fit the part, and for awhile I was wondering if I was ever going to see her on screen again. So when I heard they were making a Beauty and the Beast series, with Kristin as the female lead, I was ecstatic! I was literally jumping up and down for 10 minutes! As the premiere date got closer and closer, I got more and more excited. I told all my close friends that it's my new favourite TV show and they would tell me you can't know until you see it, it could be horrible. I didn't believe them, and my instincts were right. The show is amazing. As the episode continued I began to love it more and more! Kristin, as always, didn't let me down. I was a little concerned with the male lead and his acting ability, however Jay Ryan proved to be able to play the part of the Beast well, showing compassion but still able to keep a dark and mysterious character. The music for the show was great, and having Never Let Me Go by Florence and the Machine was perfect for the ending scene. Most of all I love the connection shown between Catherine(Kristin Kreuk) and Vincent(Jay Ryan). The fact that it is a crime show also makes it much more interesting and the plot is well developed, leaving the audience satisfied but with questions. Especially with Catherine's mother's death. Considering I only expected as much as a romance, since it is Beauty and the Beast, the show has done well in kicking the story up a notch. As a general Disney Beauty and the Beast fan, I also love the little references shown (e.g. how he pushed her away and how he showed his beastliness). All in all I was definitely not disappointed and cannot wait for more!",2012
2,"Soldier is exploited by the ""government"" and some ""corporation"" leading to his transformation into the not so incredible hulk, which is all the origin story you really need to know about the ""beast."" Then we have the beauty who is working one night at a bar to pay for law school, when she leaves at the end of the night her car won't start and then the big murder happens and this leads to her first encounter where the beast saves her life. Now fast forward some time into the future and she is once again encounters the beast, blah, blah, blah. We then get into the cover-up story by the corporation which tries to kill her to keep her from discovering something we don't really know what since she doesn't really know anything that the entire NYPD doesn't already know. So why the corporation would choose to kill her is beyond my understanding and seems like a plot hole, caused by the need for the writers to give us another encounter where the beast can save the beauty's life. So now we get to the murder mystery which if you've ever watched The Closer a good television show, and its a sure bet someone on this show has watched the Closer, which naturally begs the question why they'd make this show which so clearly isn't a good television show. But I digress. The reason we clearly know someone on this show watched the Closer is because the murder in this show is almost exactly the same murder/mystery from a Closer episode. In that episode the victim was poisoned using nicotine delivered through the skin via a deliberately tainted beauty product, by a jilted lover of the victim's husband who claimed he could not marry his mistress because of a nonexistent prenuptial agreement with his wife. This is the exact plot right down to the type of poison, the delivery device, the motive, and finally the use of a list of people that the husband slept with and told he couldn't marry because of the prenuptial agreement. Don't believe me watch the episode, its The Closer Season 1 Episode 2, ""About Face."" I mean sure the cheating husband jilted lover thing isn't exactly original in terms of suspects, but when you plagiarize the murder weapon, the location of the body, motive, the suspect and the method of locating the suspect its fairly difficult to believe these writers are real pros and not hacks phoning it in on this show. Its awful. Mercifully, the CW only ordered three episode of this horrendous show and aren't likely based on the ratings to order any more, so we'll be spared anymore of this drivel. If you're worried that the show is going to be canceled before we get any answers, I am too like what executive read this script and said god we have to make this show, the ideas are so fresh, the plot is so new, the concept is just out of this world.",2012
3,"THe original Beauty and the Beast became a true classic partly because it was magical. There was a whole whimsical city underneath New York that bordered on Steampunk, with a kind hearted Beast and a wise father to guide him.

9,"I am on my honeymoon with Jay Ryan and the cast of Beauty and the Beast! I am deliriously happy to have crossed the threshold of infatuation to this deep commitment. Never mind I have been married for seven years to someone else, and -oh yeah- I have never met Mr. Ryan or the other talented actors who have been flawlessly cast as my new extended fantasy family. I feel I have begun a beautiful relationship that despite the looming winter hiatus will stand the test of time until death or series finale do us part. I am besotted by Vincent and Catherine, the romantically challenged characters portrayed by Jay Ryan and Kristen Kreuk. As with any new love, I eagerly await the arrival of the object of my affection each Thursday and I feel sadness at the end of each encounter. In between, my thoughts stray constantly to my fixation and I have to restrain myself from chattering on to my friends and loved ones for fear of being labeled ""obsessed"" with a capital O. ",2012
3,"If you're into watching scrawny little girls beat up big strong criminal boys (yeah, right), then maybe you can overlook the failure of this show to have any value at all. Our little princess police woman arrests her own father, shoots her boyfriend, cuts herself a wide swath... marking her territory everywhere she goes. Can anyone here say conflict of interests? A moot point. This bastardized version of a classic story is entertaining in a comic book sort of way, but don't expect any substance here. Our ninety pound female lead is a sort of a poster child for fantasy feminism where all men are corrupt, evil, and in need of punishment... and of course where all women are enlightened, empowered enforcers who harvest favors from the men they entrap, betray and crucify. The cop lady judges, condemns, even shoots her precious beast and this pretty boy beast just keeps coming back to be set up and knocked down again... ah, the miracles of being in love. It would be easy to imagine an Energizer Bunny in all of the leading roles. The pretense of this fiasco is about as believable as a monster made of cotton candy. My suggestion would be to turn down the sound and glean what little eye candy comes your way from this piece of fluff. Don't expect much and you wont be too disappointed. I used to think Miss Kreuk had so much class, but it seems that I was wrong. Maybe there are some good episodes that I haven't seen.",2014
10,"I'm a huge fan of the comic 2000AD and the character Judge Dredd since 1979, and this film completely satisfied me. They changed all the right things and kept all the right things. Director Pete Travis tackled the problem of filming a comic book by making something that looks nothing like a comic book and more like an action movie shot on location, with a simple linear plot that keeps rolling and never slows down.",2012
10,"Dredd (2012 is one of the best science fiction action film adapted by comic book 2000 AD. It is one of my personal favorite movies. This is the character that kicks ass! This movie is so much better than original Stallone film. Stallone's Judge Dredd did not kicks ass, Karl Urban's Dredd did! I love this film to death I love it so much and it is better than Judge Dredd (1995) and it always will be! Dredd kills like 50 people in here, there are 100 of bodies everywhere I love this action film to death! ",2015
8,"The basic aim of Dredd is simple – it needs to be bold, true to the source material and full of juicy violence, enough to wipe out the memories of the notoriously poor Stallone attempt of 1995 that threw plenty of money at the screen without bothering to work on anything resembling a decent script.",2012
8,"I've been a Dredd fan for thirty years now, but I'm not about to give this movie adaptation of my favourite comic character a ridiculously high rating purely from some misguided sense of loyalty. Instead, I'm going to give it a deservingly high score because, quite simply, it is a very good film, one that successfully captures the essence of the 2000AD strip, delivering brutal action by the bucket-load, excellent central performances, and inspired direction, all enhanced by breathtaking state-of-the-art 3D special effects.",2012
8,"'Dredd' is an efficient and entertaining action movie, with lots of memorable moments, kills and one-liners. ",2012
8,"Let me start by saying, I thoroughly enjoyed this film, as in my opinion, it did everything right. Sure, it had no real substance of a story line (hence the 8/10) but that didn't take much away from the film. The simplistic story also had its advantages, as more time could be dedicated to Dredd doing what Dredd does best, instead of messing around in lengthy conversations. Besides, a detailed emotional story might have made this film a flop, as the cold, ruthless character of Dredd would have been somewhat diminished if that had been the case.",2012
9,"This is the dredd film you've been waiting for. It will not disappoint and it's close to the source material. If you're looking for a bad ass action hero and want some entertainment, then this is it.",2012
8,"In 1995 when Judge Dredd starring Sylvester Stallone in the title role hit theatres; critics derided it, audiences dismissed it as ""dumb"" and it failed to achieve commercial success. Even though this film has gained a cult following, it just wasn't the Judge Dredd movie fans wanted. Now a low key British film company has had another crack at bringing Dredd to the silver screen, and the result is a great science fiction action film that holds no punches and gives the audience a gritty, gory and surprisingly relatable take on the comic book hero.",2012
8,"Seventeen years ago, a Sylvester Stallone sci-fi action vehicle was released into the world under the title 'Judge Dredd'. Based on the character from the popular 2000AD comic book series, the film was a huge disappointment with critics and a source of much heartache for Dredd devotees in the way it seemed to blatantly disregard crucial aspects of the source mythology both in look and tone. Fast forward to present day, a world in which comic book characters mean big money for film studios, surely enough time has passed to give the old Judge another crack of the whip right? I'm happy to say fans of the comic book should be able to relax and enjoy this much darker and tougher representation of their much loved character. Although the film, and it's (permanently) helmeted protagonist is a straightforward and simple beast, it actually works all the better for it. Dredd isn't given a back story or imbued with much in the way of humanity, he's instead portrayed more as the mysterious 'man with no name' whose dialogue is limited to one-liners that usually precedes some serious ass kicking. Where the 1995 Judge film was light and comedic, this version is hardcore and extremely violent with some surprising explosions of brutality meted out in a world that's long since gone to hell. As is pleasingly more and more the case in mainstream action cinema, we have strong female representation in Olvia Thirlby as Dredd's rookie sidekick and a nasty Lena Headey on form and fresh from bad girl duties in the celebrated TV series Game Of Thrones. Dredd 3D can't and won't be considered a classic of the genre, but it's a huge step-up from the Stallone version and should satisfy any and all sci-fi action fans looking for a fun Friday night thrill. Visually arresting and with a sensible running time, Dredd rocks. 3.5/5",2012

Even the story of a drug related murder investigation turned into a trapped in a high rise surrounded by people that want to kill the protagonists while they themselves kill their way to the top dog. Its a bullet ballet for this generation. The visuals screamed out and were bright yet gritty and realistic. The story was just straight forward and there to move you from one insane shootout to another. The slow-mo even was what I had wanted in Max Payne. The bullets penetrating in matrix style slow-mo. Bombs and all when the movie shows from the druggies POV, but they don't over use it or any other over the top elements for that matter. That's saying something for an 100 min long action flick. It blends all its visuals and F/x wonderfully. Fun movie.",2013

As you can guess, this is not a happy-go- lucky sort of film, but nevertheless it's a very good film.",2012

7,"Ill Manors is a film that does far more than just push the boundaries previously set by British films such as Kidulthood, Adulthood and Harry Brown, of which Ben Drew played key roles in. It bends moral boundaries to a level rarely seen before in British cinema, even when the character does things for the 'greater good', the brutality of the streets re balances the already lop sided scales back into darkness, corruption and greed.",2012
8,"The film is an incredibly accurate portrait of that kind of environment. It wasn't two-dimensional in that the characters weren't just purely evil – the good in them also showed. I've met all those characters in the course of my work. The little boys terrorised into joining the criminal network are just so real. It demonstrated what I keep telling people: don't say a child chooses to join a gang; there is no choice. The cycle of brutalisation, with kids brutalising kids, the girl fights, all of it is so accurate.",2012
8,"Saw this the other week at the cinema. Watch a film. Although this type of film has been done before with the likes of 'Kidulthood' and so on, but the material has never been fresher. I'm not Plan B's biggest fan music wise. I think he's very talented and my girl loves him, but I'm more into my underground grime rather than commercial. I did, however, think he did a good job in 'Adulthood' and 'Harry Brown' so I'm guessing I'm more into his acting than his music. And I'm hoping to see a lot more after this. It's the story of different characters who connect in some way or another. Each story filled with tragedy and each character dealing with issues. Plan's B's singing narration before each story is brilliant. This won't be for everyone. There's crackheads, prostitution, pedophiles, drugs and violence but there's also an incredible empathy for even the most horrible characters. There's also some good humour too. The acting's fantastic. With some faces you know and some you don't, each performance is bang on. Overall a deep, very well made film with terrific performances and a truly original style. ****/*****",2012
9,"The film is a rap musical about the lives of drug dealers and prostitutes on a London housing estate (i.e. social housing). It is the film debut of Ben Drew aka Plan B as a director and it is a tour de force. This film has one important message relayed over and over by images and lyrics: Look what happens to children when they are abandoned, neglected or abused by their parents and adults. It is such an important message and one that society pays lip service to without reflecting upon what it means. Even in an age well versed in psychology popular thinking undermines and denies the significance of events in very early childhood. Drew makes sure that his audience 'gets' this message. Not subtle but very gritty.",2013
7,"A surprisingly well made film. The rapping narration adds an original edge to the movie. Compared to 'adulthood.' there is a lack of humor in this one. there is a darkness to each subplot. and as the film develops the moral depth increases. One one level there is the satanic message of 'vengeance is the original sin,' and the film does its best to deliver this to the viewer amidst urban blood-lust. There are a couple of references in camera-work to the Texas chainsaw massacre and taxi driver. the pacing is similar to harry brown. but without the chess like strategy. instead everything falls together like a stream of karma. where harry brown nods to the stephen Lawrence case,ill manors goes more into people trafficking.in this way it shares the vemon of ' taken.' some scenes take a culture of 'meatholes.' and 'heavy-r' and give you a side step view into this disease of female exploitation. it is done in a realistic yet artistic way. with a cultural hint of the terrible crimes towards young girls in the north of england earlier this year.",2012
10,"I ain't gonna beat around the bush here, Ill Manors is one of the best films I have seem in a long long time, If like me, you enjoy British drama's like kidulthood, adulthood & wild bill, then this is a definite!! The acting is superb and very believable.",2012
9,"I can't praise this film enough. As my title references - La Haine was a stark brutal bit of drama / reportage following serious urban rioting in Paris estates and around France that caught politicians unaware and without the tools to understand what was going on.

9,"It has been a while since I have been spirited to write a positive review on a film, I'm always drawn though to gritty British street drama by the likes of Shane Meadows(This is England, Dead Man's Shoes) and Guy Richie, and now I have Ben Drew to look out for. The film borrows the integrating of separate lives genre such as used in Magnolia and Lock Stock with a Rap music throughout, now had I have know that it used rap music in that way I probably would have avoided it like the plague as rap music is just tedious to me under normal circumstances, but the lyrics which add narrative to the story and backgrounds of the characters is superbly done and despite my prejudice on rap music I have to hold my hands up and say ""I have been educated"" other music is well chosen and builds nicely to the feel at the time of use in the playout. All acting is good especially so from the lead characters, Chris, Aaron, Ed played by Lee Allen, Riz Ahmed & Ed Skien Respectively. I am shocked however to find according to IMDb that this is Lee Allen's only production...Wow! impressive I'm sure he's going to become one of Britain's household names. If you like this sort of British drama, go see, you will not be disappointed and well done to all concerned.",2012
9,"I think the reason why some people are marking this low is because of the subject matter and not the quality of the film. Ill Manors has a message, and having seen first hand what we in Great Britain are becoming as a society, this film tries to cram the content of this message into 2 hours. This is Ben Drew's directorial debut. In my opinion, he has done a pretty good job especially with the blending of music in to film to tell characters back stories. Katya's story in particular is played out exceptionally in rhyme. The whole Soundtrack is very cool. If you decide to watch this, be prepared, some of it is very hard to watch.",2012
4,"So, I like Ben Drew and thought this film would be incredible. I was wrong, halfway through the film there is no plot what so ever, the characters are difficult to get to know because so much is going on, and to me it gives a real negative vibe about the streets of London. Growing up outside of London I don't know what it's really like, but I'm sure this film is over the top with the theme of gun crime, prostitution and drug dealing. Being a female I found some scenes quite difficult to watch such as a pregnant character being beaten by other females, not sure if this is likely to happen.. I don't know. Maybe I didn't like the film because it's so negative and nothing exciting or great happens, it's just too much like Adulthood. It's just another London film on drugs and guns. Nothing special.",2012
2,"If you're the kind of person who thinks that anything really grim and depressing and violent is automatically deep and thought-provoking and 'telling the truth', then this is the movie for you. If you're looking for a movie that actually has something to say beyond 'look how horrible this is!' then you'll probably find this a bit silly.",2012
8,"I wasn't looking forward to this at all. It looked like it was some pop star who had just fallen in the right place, and wanted to cash in on his fame.",2012
9,"I don't tend to review films based on this interesting editing style or that clever visual device, but I find that this film has been going around and around in my head over the last few days. In fact - the only thing that I care about in films is whether or not I enjoy it, and with the curiously named Ill Manors, I find myself giving a definite thumbs up.",2012
8,"when i first seen the trailer for ill manors i cant say i was too exited, i thought it was gonna be another kidulthood type of film, and i was very surprised at what i got, the movie is the British equivalent of 'mean streets'. a no holds barred look at lower end of the underworld, it's grimy, depressing, funny and shocking all in equal measure. the cast in this movie is brilliant, and are all convincing as some tough guys you wouldn't want to mess with, the movie is at times violent, but in a more realistic way, than i suppose the ott violence of 'rise of the footsoldier' or 'outlaw', there are some quite shocking moments, and the movie is quite ambitious and it feels like a mini epic, much like 'rise of the footsoldier', this movie is not as good or well made as that movie, but its miles above most movies of it's type, and is a great British gangster movie, that looks at the dirtier side most movies don't, not all gangsters are rich with nice cars, some are merely gangsters because its an easier way of life. the movie is directed by rapper plan b, and he clearly knows his subject matter well, as there is an undeniable realism to the movie, and he incorporates his music into the film well, yet never feels like a vanity project, it is a very well made and gritty crime drama, and i recommend",2012
6,"This is a very hard film to review And as a matter of fact it was a very hard film to watch too. More than once I found myself having to look away from the screen, just to be able to catch up with my breath and I had to remind myself ""It's only a movie It's only a movie"" Or is it? Sure one would want to give the film some credit for attempting to talk about some really serious issues in a stark and crude realistic way. However I find myself wondering: just because a movie touches important issues and goes to places where many don't even dare looking, does that make it a good film? Ill Manors (still trying to work the meaning of the actual title) is clearly a film made by a first time director: it's full of energy and ideas. It's inspirational too But unfortunately some of the inexperience shows up on the screen too. It's almost as if director Ben Drew didn't feel confident enough of his own material and felt he had to pepper the film (unevenly, I may add) with a series of flashy visual devices: some of them work, but then, once the story takes over, the film almost forgets to keep up with them. It makes me wonder if Ill Manors could have been a much more powerful film, if the director had actually restrained some of that rather showy visual style and non-linear editing and had just concentrated more of the story. I'm not against time-laps or montage sequences edited to rap music (some of which were actually beautifully done), but I think once you establish a style, you should stick with it. In Ill Manors everything felt rather random and arbitrary: a hotchpotch of visual ideas and devices, borrowed from many other films before (Pulp Fiction and Trainspotting, just to mention the most obvious ones), but all without any real reason. And the proof is in the pudding: the strongest and most interesting bits in the film are also the plainest and the ones where the director focused just on his actors (or actually non-actors apparently) to tell the story of a broken society alive and well right in the heart of London. Despite the claims of realism, this bleak vision of Britain feels a bit contrived in places: lines like ""Can I try some crack?"" the endless prostitution scenes and the final sequence in particular when a fire takes place in a pub, all feel a bit heavy-handed and wildly exaggerated. Also most of the characters are a little bit too stereotypical and the film seems to rely more on the charisma of our main lead, Riz Ahmed (from Four Lions), for the audience to sympathise with, instead of giving him a full fleshed-out and a much more believable persona. In the end the amount of horror and depressing bleakness is just too much and what was already a fairly long film, with too many subplots, eventually just imploded. An exhausted audience during my screening even burst into laughing during the final climax (yes, it might have been a hysterical laugh, but still a laugh and that's just the wrong reaction to have for such film!). The points Ill Manorswants to make are made quite earlier on and after a while it all becomes just too repetitious, over the top and indulgent. All this makes it loose its edge and diminishes its important message. It is a brave film and certainly must be commended for trying: there are some very intense and good moments, which I am really praising, however, even though I might talk to people about Ill Manors, I don't think I'll ever recommend anyone to watch it (aside for our prime ministers and politicians). 6.5/10 MovieGeekBlog",2012
8,"A lot of reviews here have argued that Continuum show advances a pro- corporate, anti-democracy viewpoint. It doesn't, but you could be forgiven for thinking that. Most American shows have a clear good guy (the protagonist) and a clear bad guy (the antagonists).",2012
10,"This show is better than any Canadian show I've seen so far. I'm actually surprised it's Canadian, we normally see extremely low tech and odd plot structures.",2012
8,**minor spoilers only for the first episode for explanation of the series**,2012
10,"Let me tell youI watched the final episode of season 1, andI can't wait season 2!!! ",2013
9,Continuum is very well acted thanks to a host of established actors from other series. The leading lady Rachel Nichols is thoroughly convincing in character and has the on-screen ability to keep viewers wondering and watching what she is going to do next. The overall plot has lots of room for development which is significant if the series is to continue. Best of all viewers will want to watch episode after episode because the storyline is that good. Special Effects are very good too as should be expected today but the show obviously has been awarded a fair sized investment because there is a sophisticated gloss to the entire production other shows don't have. The first series is very good and I am currently looking forward to the second. If the second is as good as the first this could develop into a long-term show. I sincerely hope so.,2012
9,"What make Continuum different and interesting, isn't the central plot to the show, it's the characters and their motives. It's a bit more nuanced than your typical good cops vs. bad guys.",2012
8,"This is one of the most creative and imaginative shows on television. It honors the sci-fi genre by actually addressing the questions we must ask ourselves about the future and how our actions in the present will shape it. This is what science fiction, at it's best, is meant for. Instead of depending on elaborate sets and overblown special effects (almost everything is filmed on location in Vancouver) the show leans heavily on good writing and performances and a plot that twists and turns without coming off as totally implausible or absurd. ",2014
9,This show looks promising! An interesting storyline with talented actors and actresses. Fantastic CGI. Easily the best new sci-fi show this month.,2012
9,My week is not started until I get to watch my Continuum. ,2012
9,"Stumbling across this action/drama/sci-fi as I looked over what shows I was going to scope out this season, I wasn't actually thinking this show was going to be quite as good as it actually was. I am a sucker for ANY sci-fi/fantasy shows, even those that are quite terrible, and this one certainly not does not fall into the terrible category. I was kept on the edge of my seat, and I can't wait to see more.",2012
9,"I thought the series was really good, and the ending was about what you'd expect. I wish they would have had a full season to wrap it up, though, instead of trying to cram everything into 6 episodes. That really made them have to skip a lot of things and constantly left me thinking I missed an episode somewhere in between even though I hadn't. Having a 6-episode final season was better than having the show just dropped, don't get me wrong, but it didn't quite do it justice like a full final season would have. I felt this show was good, creative sci-fi, and it's a real shame that it got cancelled since they could have done so much more with it. Still, despite those nits I've picked, it was worth watching, and I would recommend it to any sci-fi fan.",2015
4,"The pilot of Showcase's new TV show Continuum, featuring the stunning Rachel Nichols, seems at first like a cookie-cutter Terminator-type plot where goodies and baddies time travel to hunt each other in the past. However, it may have more depth than it first leads us to believe.",2012
10,"I would like to thank you for entertaining all of us. It is heart dropping to know the season has finally come to an end and it's time to say good bye. Thank you Mr. Simon Barry, Rachel, Victor, Erik and all the cast and crew in keeping the love for the show. The show was inspiring and fascinating to watch, with a very creative and honest story. As a small time actor and film producer, I could only have dreamed of working with a great producer and cast on a production such as Continuum. I would, very much like to see everyone in other projects but will surely miss everyone as the original Continuum family. Thank you once again for being there,..... here,.... now and forever.",2015
1,"I don't know why I kept watching this show even after I had to put my brain in a jar 10 minutes into each episode. Where should I start? 1. Evil corporations are good and Freedom Fighters/Rebels are bad? 2. All the bad guys are ex-special forces but are no match in a fight with the good guys. Be it guns or fists. 3. Kiera's suit and gun would amaze a bad guy from 2012 but why should any of these (eg tracker) be a surprise for a bad guy from 2077? 4. The bad guys always kill people even if there is another option to get their job done. 5. The bad guys have gang tattoos, funky hairstyles and smoke dope.",2012
6,"Basic plot; in the future the world is run by corporations. A group of terrorists (or freedom fighters, as you will) commit a 9/11 style crime and are captured/sentenced to death.

Now in their past, our present, they have weekly bad guy trying to destroy the world, good guy trying to stop them hi-jinks.",2012
4,Not a good sci-fi or action series.,2012

7,"Brand new sci fi series that looks promising. I saw the pilot (and yes IMDb helped me make the decision). In 2077 rich corporations rule the North American Union. A group of criminals slated for execution instead travel back in time (2012)to terrorize the past. By accident a cop from the future also gets sent back in time where she helps the Vancouver police to bring the baddies to justice. I'm really interested to see if it is actually the criminals who are bad or if it is the corporations. What side will morality and freedom take? I think that will be interesting to see in this new series. If you remember Charmed, Coop Phoebe's husband plays the good cop. I wonder if I can take him seriously in this role. Ha.",2012
2,While the concept grabbed my attention and I love seeing some of the faces from other shows I have never gotten past the pilot. I find the main character acting wooden and stiff. Makes you hope the Freedom Fighters or Anti-Corp Terrorist win.,2014
5,"I don't often sit on the fence with shows and films, but in this case I find it hard not too. I want to like this show. Its Canadian, the acting is decent, the lead is terribly cute, and though the 'Time-Tangerine' is perhaps the most ridiculous plot-centric prop in TV history, all the other futuristic elements are relatively neat and believable. The first few episodes seemed to suggest that the show would portray a continuous, developing story; one that would surely get side-tracked from time to time, but would flow through each episode, as seen with most of the truly exceptional dramas on TV today. To my disappointment, the show has instead adopted the more classic 'single story per episode' method more in keeping with the buckets of 'CSI'-style shows out there, which this show increasingly resembles with each new episode, the last two of which have been particularly weak.",2012
1,"How stupid do you have to be to come up with a series where the main character is hunting down freedom fighters for the benefit of big corporations, especially at a time where in the real world people are struggling to make ends meet and a sentiment of growing resentment towards big money and big corporations is on the rise, i guess the geniuses behind this disaster of a show will eventually come up with a twist that changes the main character mission, probably at the end of the first season where she will switch sides and start fighting big greedy corporations, but it is too much self-punishment for me to wait tell then, not really into masochistic pleasure, another thing is that i don't really know why in all Canadian TV, the leading female characters are very hard to like. If i could give it less than one star i would have, don't bother with it.",2012
10,"In literature; the hero is a Robin Hood like person, stealing from the rich and giving to the poor, this series does the opposite as the main character is a brainwashed female law enforcer who is set to capture or kill the people fighting the dictatorship of the corporation. It makes you wonder if this series was financed by wall street and the likes. the story has flaws as the knowledge of the past was well managed by the main character while the assumed villains have no idea how to react in a past time environment even when the show indicates that the time travel was initiated by the so called villains and the main law enforcement character was dragged to the time travel by poor chance.",2012
5,"The concept for this show is great. You have a dystopian future setting in 2077, time travel, some interesting technologies. A corporate congress that has taken over the government. Terrorists that are fighting for liberty by any means necessary. A story that treads the line between good and evil and moral quandary. The special effects are pretty decent for a TV show, and I was impressed with the production value. All of it seemed like an amazing setup for a show until it devolved into a cliché crime show drama with really poor dialogue catch phrases. The actors feel really stiff, but you can tell they are trying to make the most of very poor writing. It is almost like they felt the need to make it more like CSI or Law and Order to please a mass audience. Maybe they are right, but I found it dry and it left a bitter taste in my mouth because the premise had so much potential. If you are looking for a real SciFi show you will probably be disappointed, maybe even angry that a show that could be so much more has been diluted down for mass appeal.",2012
10,"I am so glad to see a local author recognised during their working life in this way! Fantastic to see the series made. Yes, they have changed a few of the ""facts"" but it has to tie together within a restricted framework of a TV series.",2012
10,I am frequently in awe of many reviews posted on IMDb. The writer's have insights and knowledge of production techniques that amaze me.,2012
9,"Call me nerdy, I love this show and so looking forward to season 2. Thank the tech nerds for the internet that allows me to see shows from all the world. They are who have given me access to great shows such as The Killing (Danish), Downton Abbey, Miss Fisher and so many more.",2012
7,"As someone who hasn't read Kerry Greenwood's novels, I found this entertaining, light- hearted and aesthetically pleasing. Perhaps a little formulaic and not particularly creative in its plot devices, but altogether an enjoyable way to while away an hour on a Friday night. In fact, I may now read the novels after all.",2012
8,"I happened upon Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries quite by accident. I'd never read (or even heard of) the books, but the programme drew me in, and is now one of my favourites. It's set in 1920s Melbourne, and although as the title says, each episode is concerned with a murder, it's lots of fun, and not too gory at all. Because of the time it is set in, there are no sophisticated forensic techniques to be handily applied to push the story forward (such as in CSI and numerous of its copies). It's basically good old sleuthing by Phryne Fisher and Inspector Jack Robinson. I love Essie Davis and Nathan Page as Phryne and Jack - the chemistry between them is almost palpable.",2013
9,"As a life long mystery buff,I find ""Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries"" to be a real treat. The series is very reminiscent of Agatha Christie's ""Marple"" (with Geraldine McEwan ) and ""Poirot"" (with David Suchet). There's just something special about period murder mysteries, perhaps it's the lack of high tech machines that do our sleuthing for us, a la CSI, or maybe it's the romanticism of the period itself. Regardless, Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries is expertly produced from exquisite wardrobe & makeup, to lush shooting locations and breathtaking cinematography. Every element of the production is done with such attention to detail, you loose yourself in the story. The two leads, Essie Davis as Miss Phryne Fisher and Nathan Page as Detective Jack Robinson are perfect in their roles. Having watched each episode thus far, I cannot imagine anyone else portraying these delightful characters and their chemistry is undeniable. The entire cast is great, the characters are well thought out and multi-dimensional. The episodes are also well done, peppered with historical information and accuracy. I would highly recommend ""Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries"" to any mystery buff, it's a modern classic done in the period style of the roaring 20's.",2013
10,"The characters have excellent chemistry between them. I love the relationship between Ms. Fisher and Jack between Dot and Hugh, and between Dot and Ms. Fisher. Then there is Cec and and Bert and Mr. Butler. Everyone is such a delight. And Aunt P is great too. the plots a good but the people the actors are great. ",2014
10,"I absolutely love the series, inventive and Esse Davis is marvelous. If we could go back in time we would find out that actually women had the vote then as NZ was the first followed shortly after by SA and the rest of the states in the late 19th Century. Well before England.",2013
10,This series is Drop Dead Fabulous. I have been longing for a new period style murder mystery series. And Essie Davis is simply perfect and delicious as Phryne Fisher.,2013
10,I stumbled upon this show browsing netflixs. I was like why not and im thrilled with it. This show exceeded any expectations i had. The plots are excellently executed and keep you guessing. Ms davis does a fabulous job with her sleuthing and has brilliantly witty dialog. I love how they have her character push boundaries for a female in that era. She is bold and refuses to back down and conform to what people expect. Ms. Fisher not only breaks female roles for the era but inspires other character as well especially her companion Dot. I highly recommend this show to everyone who enjoys a good mystery you will not be disappointed! !!!,2015
10,"I am not familiar with the series of books; I am looking at this as a TV show. The camera work and editing are top notch. This should be purchased and run ""as is"" on US television. So much of the TV in the USA is frankly bad TV--as is the stuff from Canada (much of which is on USA also.) Is it perfect-award-winning stuff? Possibly not. Does it draw me to watch just as much as the first years of Midsomer Murders? Absolutely yes.",2012
10,"Phryne is an intelligent, beautiful, confident woman, and, as a detective, she is absolutely remarkable. Her personality is refreshing and unique. The plots aren't very out-of-the- ordinary for the most part, but, with a leading lady like this one, it didn't bother me at all. In fact, I am addicted and adding a shameless plug here - please give us another season! My review must be a min amount of lines, so I'm just going to name some of my favorite things about this show: 1. Phryne is a multi-faceted character, with tons of interesting back story and experience. 2. Her taste in clothes and guns is fabulous - the whole series is very pleasing to the eye and makes me wish I could bring back the '20s style. 3. She's a good person - this is made clear in several episodes and she almost seems like the big sister you always wished for. Long story short, watch this show so they will make more seasons!",2015
9,"How can you not like a heroine like Phryne Fisher adeptly played by Essie Davis. Although I thought the scripts in Season 3 were not as strong as the previous seasons, there is a lot to like about how this series is evolving, including scenes with more active violence, an expanded role for Dot, and the growing sexual tension between Jack and Phryne. The costumes and set design still make me swoon. I sure hope Hugo Johnstone-Burt will be returning as Constable Hugh in Series 4, he and actress Ashleigh Cummings, who plays Dot, have a sweet chemistry going. There will BE a Season 4, right Australian Broadcasting Company??? This series certainly deserves more episodes.",2015
9,"This is an absolute treat. It takes place in the 1920s in Australia. The detective is a wealthy flapper, who reminds me a bit of Diana Rigg in the Avengers.",2015
10,"The spoiler has to do with the books, not the television show! I fell in love with this program when I joined Acorn Online in 2013 and was so happy to find out there was to be a season two. I've just begun to read Kerry Greenwood's novels, and I can honestly say (in my humble opinion), the television show is loosely based on the novels.",2014
10,"It took me awhile, but this show is a great mystery. After watching the first series, I bought the ""Cocaine Blues"". Some reviewers seem to have issues with the differences between the book and the TV series. Rarely do they match up, and I am totally into both. Essie Davis is perfect in the title role. Dot's character is different, but...as I said. Being a jazz musician, I am taken also by the soundtrack for the show. I've gotten both series 1& 2 and play them ALL THE TIME. It is difficult to put an entire book into a 1hr episode, so I would have to disagree with the person who was upset by the ""jumping around"" feel of the show. I would love to see a full length movie come out of this. Give it a chance, it'll grow on you and you won't be able to stop.",2015
7,"Of course it would have been impossible to successfully bring Kerry Greenwood's amazing Phryne Fisher to the small screen and this effort, although lovely to look at falls short on several fronts.",2012
10,My husband and I are watching Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries for the second time around and really enjoying it.,2018
9,"Essie is such a delight. She's a Thoroughly Modern Millie in the flesh. Being a Yank, the setting is great because it's 'new"". My wife and I really enjoy the characters and the plots. The whole thing is just good fun to watch. If you like detective dramas but are a tad burned out on the usual fare then by all means give this a try!",2017
10,"This delightful and entertaining mystery drama made its debut on Australia's ABC-TV in 2012. Based on Kerry Greenwood's novels, the series follows the adventures of Phryne Fisher, a 1920's English heiress, and her devoted companion, Dorothy. Essie Davis is marvelous as the self-assured and free-thinking Phryne, who engages merrily in a number of torrid one- night affairs when she's not otherwise solving murders. While all the production values are generally excellent, the standout feature must be Phryne's stunning wardrobe. It is said her costumes have inspired numerous 1920s look-alike parties. If you enjoy good mysteries in stylish settings with colorful characters aplenty, then this clever series will surely satisfy. My wife and I have watched this series many times and have discovered something new and entertaining with each viewing. Highly recommended!",2017
10,"I was surprised to see one reviewer note that the Phryne Fisher of the books was about 27 years old. I have never thought of her as a day younger than mid-40s, that is, about the age of Essie Davis. Seriously, a twenty-something with Miss Fisher's depth of humanity and practical knowledge? ""Worldliness"" is more than being sexually experienced; Miss Fisher's worldliness results from immersion in many areas of human interest over years, hardly possible for someone in her 20s.",2017
10,"This show is absolutely perfect in every way! The characters, casting, acting, dialogues, locations, content, costumes, chemistry, plot and everything is very well balanced and presented spectacularly. Essie Davis as Phryne Fisher is truly mesmerizing while Nathan Page as the Detective Inspector brings to life a very special pairing in Phryne and Jack. The chemistry is explosively subtle! I have watched all the Sherlock Holmes, Poirot, Miss Marple etc series and stumbled into this accidentally on Netflix recently and I must say it changed my perception in Australian productions entirely. Very unexpectedly impressive! The best i've seen so far in this genre. I find it unbelievable and so disappointing the entire series was stopped abruptly (season 3 only having 8 episodes). What a shame this series wasn't continued, however i am eagerly waiting for the movie trilogy expected in 2018.",2017
10,My wife and I both found Miss Fisher to be absolutely delightful. I cannot imagine why they made so few episodes. Miss Fisher was truly a woman out of her own time. Her sleuthing capabilities were outstanding. The other members of the cast were nearly perfect.,2017
10,"Earlier today, I wrote a long-winded narrative where I broke down everything I like about Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries (or MFMM for the rest of this). But I decided to scrap it because there's really no point in posting it here. I've already beat that horse to death with what I've written and posted on the individual episodes. So I'll shorten it to this – I had more fun watching MFMM than I have any series in a long time. The show has style, humor, drama, mystery, action, romance – it's got it all. MFMM is wildly entertaining. And that's what it's all about for me – entertainment. ",2017
4,"As I watched ""Magic Mike"", I was entertained and hopeful. Some of its elements were fascinating and the storyline seemed to be heading in an interesting direction. Each new scene seemed to lead toward a climax that could make the movie's run time worthwhile.",2012
8,"This might come as a shock to some, but this is not really a movie about male strippers. Yes, two of the principal characters are male strippers, but—as Channing Tatum's character (Magic Mike himself) says at a crucial point in the film, ""That's what I do—it's not who I am."" Amid the bountiful buttcheeks and brawny pecs on display, there is a real story here about ambition, and goals, and loyalty, and commitment, and self-actualization. Yes, I used the term ""self-actualization"" in a review of ""Magic Mike""; I told you you might be shocked.",2012
1,"A good poster, and an effective trailer, make excellent marketing tools for a truly awful movie.",2012
9,"Many people like to generalize things to make it easier to understand the world. When the trailer for MAGIC MIKE was revealed, it was labeled as just a ""male stripper movie,"" like how BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN was just a ""gay cowboy movie."" This generic label, undermining and downgrading the film's actual quality, even overshadows the fact that Steven Soderbergh is the director, who rarely make films that lack substance. Yes, MAGIC MIKE has style, but it has substance as well. Here's the kicker: Those who want to see the film primarily for the stripping may be left disappointed, as they will likely fidget in their seats for these scenes to come. As one lady sitting next to me said once the credits rolled, ""Worst movie ever."" On the other hand, those who refuse to see the film because of its subject matter may be missing a great film.",2012
4,"Well, well, well... I went on to see it thinking ""You can't just get enough of pretty naked men"". As it appeared I was wrong. First of all: although Channing Tatum here actually played his part instead of just being on the screen, I've had too much of his ego after first 40 minutes. Second: none of the cast, except for Matt McConaughey and Matt Bomer, was visible enough to create a full-blooded character. I will not mention their bad preparation, because I can't believe that you cannot teach Joe Manganiello how to dance. And third: it is really sad not to see the director's work. It seems like no one red the script to notice how bad it was, when it comes to structure and building characters. I got an impression that for some, money and wild party were the only reason to take part in this project. As far as I'm concerned, I'd like to see more of ""Let's make a good film"" attitude rather than purely ""Let's make loads of money from girls shy enough not to go into strip club""... It made me sad - I was counting on something that would be a start of amazing acting careers for Joe Manganiello, Matt Bomer, Adam Rodriguez and Alex Pettyfer. Well, in my opinion this film won't help. Period.",2012
3,"I am going to make my review short, sweet, and to the point. Something Magic Mike was not. As far as the stripping goes and the first hour of the movie, it wasn't that bad. I actually had a good time. When the movie got close to two hours, I along with everyone else in the theater were ready to leave. That being said, I think the writer of the film was also ready to leave... his computer from writing the script, because there was NO ENDING... they kind of sum up two characters and thats it.. for the rest of the cast you spend 2 hours getting to know them, you have no idea if they die from too much crack or if they quit dancing or if they have fun at a new club... there needed to be at least a photo of each character with a small description of what happened to them next... NOT TO GIVE ANYTHING AWAY... but one of the main characters in the movie has a HUGE LIFE ISSUE, and they NEVER SOLVE IT, they give you nothing... just ""WELL THESE TWO PEOPLE ARE HAPPY, THE END""",2012
3,"I went to see this movie last night with some girlfriends. We had some cocktails beforehand and were primed to drool over the hunky men doing their stripteases. How sadly disappointed we were. The lead actress had one facial expression the entire time. The dialog was hardly developed and gave me the feeling of bored students reading a book aloud with no emotion. I eagerly waited for the next strip scene and while the choreography was good, it really wasn't enough to make up for the rest of the movie. There was no chemistry between Brooke and Mike and am I the only one who was disturbed by Brooke watching her brother strip? Frankly, I'm surprised at how many good reviews this movie received. I really wanted to like it, even if just for Matthew and Channing. Even though I went in knowing the plot was not the greatest (from someone who saw it before me), I was surprised at how truly bad it was. Wait for the DVD and use your fast forward!",2012
3,"Magic Mike is one of those many films that I could guess the plot exactly before I saw it. I don't know if its because its super predictable or if I've seen too many movies. Anyways, here is how I predicted how the film would go down before I saw it: Popular guy with pretty good life turns into a Disney princess because he wants ""something more"" in his life than what he's use to. He meets girl, falls in love with girl but is torn between his life and girl. He (shockingly) picks girl with limited personality instead of pretty good life and they all live happily ever after. That was my prediction BEFORE I saw the movie.",2012
7,"So many elements that could have made this a truly original movie. Instead it's confusing, meandering and ultimately pointless. Alex Pettyfer, the innocent entering the world of male strippers has a good face a great body but lacks life, yes, that's it, he's kind of lifeless. Channing Tatum, whose story, apparently, this is, has a body that seems to have been shaped by a genius, but a face that looks slightly unfinished. I didn't get his character at all. As an actor Channing tries far too hard. Matthew McConaughey is a hoot, Great chest and he seems to be relishing the spotlight. So, all in all, entertaining and little, very little else.",2012
2,"my girlfriends and I were so excited to see this, we were thinking it was going to be a fun movie with some hot guys. Let me put it to you this way. In the beginning all the women in the theater were cheering and clapping like they were in a real strip club so I thought yaay this is going to be fun, then after the first hour there was no more clapping or cheering, you could hear crickets and I felt the same way. By the end, nothing gets resolved for anyone and you're just left thinking ""what just happened"" I give it a 2 because SOME of the dance numbers were fun and Channing was very nice to look at. As another reviewer said, if you rent the movie, fast forward to the strip dance scenes I promise you won't miss anything else. It's sad because I really wanted to like this movie :(",2012
7,This takes place in Florida. A 30 year old male stripper Magic Mike (Channing Tatum) meets young Adam (Alex Pettyfer) who has no direction in life. Mike takes him under his wing and gets him to be a stripper. He also romances Adams' sister Brooke (Cody Horn). But Adam gets hooked on drugs and things get dangerous.,2012
1,I found nothing to like about this movie. It is billed firstly as a comedy and then as a drama. There was no comedy. I didn't laugh. The script was dreadful. There was no drama. Why did anyone think it would be a good idea to make this film? This is the worst film I have seen this year. My only purpose in writing this review is to warn you not to go and see this film.,2012
8,"The upbeat trailer with quippy banter, cute gags and promises of washboard abs & tight tushies is very misleading. And the IMDb plot summary makes me want to hurl: ""A male stripper teaches a younger performer how to party, pick up women, and make easy money."" ""Magic Mike"" is a great movie but for different reasons and for a different audience than the trailer may attract. It's not a fun & wild romp nor is it a quirky romcom with a lot of chuckles. It's a complex drama that focuses on success vs. the illusion of success. It could've been set on Wall Street. It could've been set in a law firm. It could've been set in any one of the paragons of success that we envision when we hear that word. Instead it's set in a male nudie bar with tons of hormone-raging women waving, hurling and stuffing $1 bills into mens' thong underwear.",2014
9,"It really, really boggles my mind just how the brains of so many of you people work. 90% of the reviews on here are exactly the same ""the stripping was the ONLY good thing about the movie"". I couldn't disagree more.",2012

5,"Soderbourgh's made a movie that really seems to get the joy of stripping. The scenes that are the movie's reason for being I have to admit are very well shot, well lit, well choreographed, and really get at the joy and pure giddiness that both the guys feel performing and the joy that the women in the audience feel watching them. They're the centerpieces of the film, and the film whatever else you may or may not feel about Channing Tatum's character or the rather vacuous supporting characters orbiting him---those scenes really pop and bring the movie to life. Its unfortunate that everything that's in between those scenes feels like so much filler meant to beef up the film's dramatic quotient so that its not just seen as that dude stripper movie. (Not unlike how Soderbourgh's previous film ""Haywire"" also only really came to life during the various action scenes of its main character springing to life and doing the real fighting scenes that were that movie's reason for being made and how everything else there was also filler--albeit somewhat more entertaining filler) ",2012
7,"Mike (Channing Tatum) is a stripper. He's also a contractor and furniture business entrepreneur. He's actually a pretty stand-up young man. Adam (Alex Pettyfer) isn't as put together, but his sister wants him to be. So when she ventures out to Xquisite, the all male dance revue, she exclaims ""I was hoping it was all a joke."" I don't blame her, I thought it was too. Mike responds, ""No, but it is pretty funny."" He's also right.",2012
1,"Apart from the fantastic backside of Channing Tatum this film was a waste of 7 pounds. It has been hyped in the press recently and I thought it looked like funny film but no, I was met with a film with no storyline, events that came from nowhere and overall I would rather watch reruns of the care-bears than witness this again. I mean come on Channing Tatum? Matthew M-whatever? They have actually done some decent films, attractive men that had a chance of starring in a great film, where was the storyline guys? Because it clearly wasn't in any of your thongs? Upsides? Seeing some hot men strippers and having time to daydream and reflect on my life in the time the film was playing.",2012

1,"The whole audience were women so we thought this we be fun; it was not. They showed boobs in the first 10 seconds! Why? We have boobs and were not impressed so all of us let out a groan. There were saggy boobs later in the film, which according to the film were 'great'. Groan again. The dancing by the wrestler/dancer was awful either due to laziness or incompetence. The story was shallow which made it drag. The dance sequences were short and they had way too many clothes on to be strippers, one dance the main character had on pants and a shirt; the dancing was lacking and uninspired. The butts were cute but rare. All the main character did was say how he wanted to build things. He never lifted a hammer the whole movie. If anyone tells you this a like Boogie Nights-they are lying. That is a great film. 'I'm a bright shining star'. One penis (just one!) minus two boobs and I might give it a 2.",2012
1,"This film is absolutely horrendous. Very rarely do I come on IMDb to write a review, but for this debacle, I felt it was necessary. Like a previous reviewer mentioned, you shouldn't go in to this movie expecting an Oscar contender. Because, trust me, it was far, far from that. Perhaps even a few Razzie nominations would be fitting. Not a single character was even remotely likable. They all were very obnoxious (especially McConaughey). The relationship between Mike and Brooke (Cody Horn) seemed very forced and unnatural. The characters were so unlikable that after 30 minutes into the film, I was ready for it to be over. I thought the script was very bland. The move was also too long. It didn't seem to have a plot line. The film just meandered for nearly two hours. It was almost torturous. The only thing that was OKAY about this film was the cinematography. It was shot in typical Soderbergh style. At the end of the film, I asked myself, ""Why should I care?"" It was a total bore. The characters were annoying. And it had no plot line. Not even the dance scenes could save this film. Horrible. Wait for DVD if you are curious.",2012
1,I can't believe people are giving this movie rave reviews - I cannot understand that one single bit. This movie goes down as one of the WORST movies I've seen in my 40 years on this earth. ,2012
8,"Surprisingly, I went to see this movie on my own free will (not dragged by my girlfriend, not with family, or even friends for good laughs). I was not there to see the stripping, but there to see if this movie had any sort of a plot. Here's the main focus of the plot: Mike is an ordinary man by day and stripper by night. Although it may not seem like it, Mike has a dream of owning his own business with stripping as his only means of funding that dream. He then mentors a younger co-worker (Adam) in the life and style of stripping (good and bad). As the movie progresses, Mike becomes aware of Adam's sudden change of personality, behavior and the movie shows the darker sides of his night job. From then on, Mike wonders about whether he needs to leave this lifestyle or continue to do what he does best.",2012
6,"The movie is good (not great, though), specially because of the visual effects and Charlize Theron acting. She is great, beautiful, impressive, plays her role full of passion, as usual. Also I think there was no need for a 127 minutes picture. It could last less time, because in some moments I felt like they were just dragging it for no reason. I expected more, but all the problem is with Snow White choice. Kristen Stewart is like my refrigerator, no matter what I put in it (milk, soda, eggs, vegetables, meat), it is and it will always be a refrigerator. And so is she. She is always the same, no matter what role she is playing. If she can be an actress, so can my refrigerator. They are both cold and have no expression.",2012
3,"Well I saw huntsman the opening night, midnight showing. I went into it expecting something amazing. It was...alright. Honestly the visuals were really good. I enjoyed the how well Chris Hemsworth and Charlize Theron portrayed their roles and drew me into the story. The little girl that played Snow White at the beginning had me entranced, and everything was going great - then she grew up.",2012
1,"As a huge fan of fantasy books and films, I had very high hopes for this one... Especially when people said ""oh, you liked Lord of the Rings? You'll love this!"" The verdict? I now know who *not* to listen to next time. If your tastes are similar to mine, you tend to read the books before watching the movies and you don't really follow particular actors. So, really, I had high expectations for this film - and that might've been the problem... Charlize Theron played the evil queen well but I would've loved it if the film had delved further into the queen's history as several ideas were started but never really explained (I have a decent imagination but I don't really think, as a viewer, I should be entirely responsible for thinking up ways to connect the dots). For instance, why is the Queen able to feel everything her brother feels? Why did her mother decide to give her the spell rather than both her and her brother or just her brother? And why, once we get into the meat (or the attempt at the meat) of the story, did the Queen spare Snow White's life when she didn't yet know Snow White was ""the fairest""? And if she did know, all the more reason! Why spare her?? The Huntsman was, I would argue, the best developed character - at least in comparison to the others. At the very least, you knew enough to explain his drinking problem and his bitterness... That said, his wasn't an overly complex character to portray. For exactly that reason, it seemed more than a little ridiculous that the Huntsman *alone* carried the romantic scenes between he and Snow White. For instance, at one point, as he leads Snow White through the forest, he takes a knife to her skirts (apparently he thought they were getting in the way). Snow White stares blankly at the Huntsman and it is only once he says ""don't flatter yourself"" that you realize the emotion Snow White was supposedly showing was chaste shock. Granted that, perhaps if I was more familiar with Kristen Stewart's acting, I might have recognized what she was portraying, but, on the other hand, I'm more of the mind that I shouldn't need to know your acting style in order to recognize so basic an emotion. This kind of jarring (not in a good way) and unbalanced acting was repeated at the end of the film when Snow White is crowned and the Huntsman enters the room. Looking at Snow White, one sees only a blank yet tearful smile, but when The camera turns to the Huntsman it dawns on you that there was supposed to be some sort of moment passing between them. All in all, the chemistry existed only on the side of the Huntsman, leaving much to be desired from Kristen Stewart's portrayal. And that, of course, brings us to Snow White. The character seems to borrow much from Joan of Arc to the point that one might wonder if she wondered into the wrong film. There is an attempt to develop the character but Ms Stewart seems to be little able to carry the development of what might have been a very strong female character. The only hint of real strength comes with Snow White's battle speech which would've been fantastic except for the utter lack of build up to this newfound strength of character. So, in spite of the best intentions, this moment came across as contrived. If only Kristen Stewart had managed to keep up that pace of energy throughout the rest of the film, it might have been more believable. So, unfortunately, though I had high hopes, I actually found myself rolling my eyes frequently and feeling a bit like I was watching someone show off all his ""super awesome"" visual effects - which *was* pretty cool... Just not enough to carry a story. In conclusion, if you count yourself as one who likes a good plot, great character development, and strong female leads... Either lower your expectations or skip this one entirely.",2012
1,"It's hard to find polite words to describe this movie, but I did start laughing about 2/3 through it, and that's not a good sign as it is not a comedy. With such memorable lines to call together an army as 'fire melts iron and it will writhe inside itself....' Wah?? Charlize Theron - who I had always respected - comes off as a grudgingly aging Real Housewives of Beverly Hills - wait, no - Orange County wearing bad eye makeup and screeching in reality-TV-caliber hissy-fit.... and I had always liked her. Kristin Stewart resembles her MAD cartoon parody. She's able to play the suffering goth waif, but when her character is supposed to play fired up or determined, she comes off more as a high school freshman that is determined to retrieve her math book from the library before the bell rings for class - not too powerful.... And when Chris Hemsworth gives a stand-out acting performance as the most believable character in this manufactured dark 'epic', well.... ya know you're in trouble.... I do admire the writers' ability, however, to cram every cliché that has ever been imagined into this 14-hour, I mean 2-hour story. Please note that I am generous in calling it a story since it actually had no plot. The characters had no depth. I was hoping that they would have done more with the wicked queen as that could have been a juicy part, but she was about as deep as the aforementioned 'Housewives.' The musical score was magnificently inappropriate for the scenes and built up at the oddest times so that one would expect something was about to happen... instead we are presented with a magical deer that doesn't really do anything but has a white aura around it. However, the musical crescendo that accompanies this scene makes you think Something is going to happen (it doesn't). OK - last negative criticism - a fun game would be to take a shot every time one of the actors unexpectedly breaks into a Really bad and unexpected British accent. Just sayin. And now I'll say something nice: the costumes were pretty good - impressive really.",2012
3,"It's an interesting retelling of Snow White, and I rather enjoyed the idea of Snow White ending up with the Huntsman as opposed to the fairly personality-less prince.",2012
1,"I have NEVER posted a review on IMDb before and I'm so sorry to inform you that this movie was so bad, I HAD say something! It might have been watchable but there was absolutely NO way that I could get past Charlize's horrible HORRIBLE British accent! Thank God for her beauty.",2012
4,"The trailers were great, they got me interested, had me excited to finally see Snow White And The Huntsman but my excitement quickly turned to disappointment. The movie starts off well showing you how the Queen came to power and did a good job of introducing her to the audience but it fell apart soon after that.",2012

3,What a load of nonsense. Those were 127 almost completely redundant minutes. It doesn't happen often but after about the first third I was considering leaving the cinema and only the ticket price kept me in my seat and the vague hope that something might change. It didn't.,2012
2,"Very poor performance from Kristen Stewart. She keeps looking as if she is sitting on the toilet and doesn't convince nor captivate the audience in many scenes. At one point in the movie she gave the men a pep talk, one of the worst ever! Almost all her dialogues are poor and unconvincing. ",2012
10,"I must say, when I first heard the news that there was going to be a Snow White live-action film, I had a good laugh. When I heard that Kristen Stewart was going to play Snow White, I had an even bigger laugh. But when I saw the trailer, I stopped laughing. And then I watched the movie, and knew I had to write a review. This film is not going to win many(if any) awards, nor will it be a favorite this year, but it is entirely a good movie. Stunning visual effects, many great landscape shots, good acting, great action, and a believable storyline. This is not the Disney film you are used to, but a much grittier and more mature take on the original tale. You should not take your children to this film, nor should the intense nature of the film scare you off. I enjoyed it from start to finish, and I think many people will too.",2012
7,"Based on the popular fairytale ''Snow White'' comes the originally titled ''Snow White....and The Huntsman'' ,an epic fantasy film starring teen favourites Kristen Stewart (of Twilight fame) and Chris Hemsworth (of Thor/Avengers fame). Now, detailing the plot shouldn't be too hard, as we all know the story from childhood- Evil Queen (Charlize Theron) with talking mirror is hell-bent on killing her 'pure' step-daughter (Stewart) and hires a Huntsman (Hemsworth) to do the job for her. The Huntsman takes pity on the girl when he finds her, and together they become fugitives, going on a journey that involves meeting Dwarfs. Seven of them to be precise. What follows is a major battle between good and evil to determine who will reign over the Kingdom, the evil Queen or our heroine Snow White?",2012

On the wedding night, Ravenna stabs King Magnus on the chest and brings the enemy army led by her brother Finn (Sam Spruell) that destroys the King's army. Ravenna imprisons Snow White on the Northern Tower of the castle while William, his father The Duke and a few survivors escape from the castle.",2012
1,"With all the hype for this movie and some really good actors (Ian McShane, Chris Hemsworth, Charlize Theron, Bob Hoskins) it was a let down. The writers didn't give Stewart enough lines and lines they did give her were horrid. That speech? That was suppose to motivate people? What the hell? The girl didn't smile at all. And yes I know the movie was set in a dark time, and there is no happiness in the land. But she didn't smile when she was brought back to life nor at the end.",2012
3,"Spectacular special effects don't overcome an underwritten relationship between the title characters and a hopelessly miscast Kristen Stewart as Snow White. A scenery-chewing Charlize Theron and a late-in-the-game appearance by the seven dwarfs add some life to the tedium until Stewart - lacking the charm, innocence, and spirituality that the part cries out for - sucks it out again.",2012
9,"When I saw the previews for both of the upcoming ""Snow White"" adaptations, I was excited. The take with Julia felt wrong, though it looked pretty good. When I saw Charlize fulminating eyes in ""The Huntsman"" I knew it would hard to miss the target. This film delivers because it goes back what inspired the original source: haunted forests, dirty, hopeless villages, dark, imposing castles, and an electrifying and literally heart-stopping villain. This one got as far away from Disney as it is possible and works as a perfect bookend to 75 years of attempts to capture the spirit of the original tale.",2012
5,"This is the second Snow White adaptation released this year except this one is designed as an action, adventure. Both are not quite outstanding but they gave some interesting twists to the story. Unfortunately, there is something gold about this but it cares too much to the visuals than anything else. There are also scenes that are taken from other fantasy, epic movies. It's good looking, but good looking is not always enough.",2012
8,"When I heard they were making this film, I was slightly anxious how this would turn out. After the disappointing re-imagining of Alice In Wonderland, I feared this would go the same way. I was wrong. Everything about this film was excellent. The level of design, the cinematography, the acting and the special effects all absolutely shone and brought this world to life, stepping effortlessly from serene and beautiful, to tough and gritty in a heart beat.",2012
1,"Ugh, this movie was disappointing to me! I was waiting the whole time for something to really hit me, and nothing did. The Huntsman only ""taught"" Snow White one thing. The end was the worst. They never clarify anything. Who does she end up choosing in the end? It could be either dude. The Huntsman wasn't wearing fancy clothes at the end and it looked like he was going to leave, so does that mean she doesn't choose him? I was so confused at the end and mad that they didn't finish the plot. Also, the writers held the awkward scenes out too long and didn't hold important scenes out long enough. The end scene was way too long. I felt awkward sitting there staring at Snow White being queen for 20 minutes. Overall, I felt like it had so much potential, but it failed miserably.",2012
8,"Mirror Mirror on the wall how was Snow White and the Huntsman after all? This is definitely a must see for the summer if you love fantasy type movies in the vain of Lord of the Rings and Legend. Great scenes incorporating stunning action sequences, comedy and what you know of the story from your youth but without running over that same old ground until it is mud. Many new fresh takes on the classic tale are here for sure to keep you entertained for it's 2 hour duration while allowing you to escape into it's magical world. Charlize Theron is amazing as the evil queen and Chris Hemsworth does a bang up job as the Huntsman. The CG effects throughout the movie are very well done and add that little bit you need to a film like this. The PG 13 rating is also appropriate since the film has a very Dark overshadow and may not be the best for small children to view. With the 2012 Summer movie season already well on the way with blockbusters such as the Avengers and MIB III, Snow White and the Huntsman will fit in just fine and hold it's own for sure.",2012

I had wriggled my way out of seeing the other Snow White movie but now I was going to have to bite the bullet. I was pleasantly surprised.

The dialogue is sharp and the storyline is excellent. The storyline doesn't adhere strictly to the Ripper mystery, because if you know anything about the actual events, it would make for a very short series. And that would be a shame, clearly. The characters have compelling, individual backgrounds & story lines which are beginning to flesh themselves out. I eagerly anticipate series 2.",2013

Through their performance they make you feel connected on such an emotional level. I really enjoy ""getting lost"" in a show that i watch; this show is so consuming that you cannot help but get lost in it. I cannot wait to see what comes next season. I just hope that the series continues as triumphant as it began; with all the wonderful writers, actors, directors, producers, and everyone else that made it such a great success. Shows such as these make ""movie"" night suspenseful and enjoyable! The shear talent/gift that it takes to create these story lines/plots/themes never creases to amaze me!",2013
9,"In my opinion, the British mystery/drama ""Ripper Street"" leaves the US ""Copper"" for dead. To all who have based their reviews on a single viewing, please give this show another chance. The acting and writing are brilliant and the characters are well-developed. Each episode leaves you wanting more. I particularly like the forensic scenes. Very interesting to see how far the science had developed during this period in British history. The stories are also well-paced, combining a good balance of action, drama and mystery. Don't give up on ""Ripper Street"" just yet because you just might be surprised by this British take on a ""whodunnit?""",2013
9,"I watch little TV and even less pot-boiler dramas, but Ripper Street drew me in from the start. The dialogue is so beautifully written, and delivered that it underlines the differentiation of the age that the program is set, and the age that we now inhabit. So clever is it though that it is always transparently clear. ",2013
9,"Ripper Street is a triumph on many levels. The acting is superb, the mysteries are riveting, and the narrative from week to week makes you more immersed and vested in the characters. The concept allows us to see how detectives solved crimes way before CSI, DNA, and forensics. But here's the real appeal of the show: There are many strong characters (police, prostitutes, girlfriends, mistresses, wives, criminals), each of whom have very differing motivations and aspirations, that constantly collide with each other. Their secrets, their intentions, and their loyalties add a fantastic backdrop to the ""mystery of the week"" making for one compelling drama. Bravo!",2015

8,"British drama knocks Coppers into a cocked hat (helmet??). I love Tom Weston-Jones and the Irish ruggedness is very appealing, but for quality acting and set believability, despite the slickness, Ripper Street sets the new standard in period TV detective series. ",2012
8,"As soon as I saw the add for this TV series on channel 10 (australia), I instantly fell in love with it. It has one of my favorite actors, Jerome Flynn, in it, who is also from Game Of Thrones. This series has great music, acting and a really good plot. I love movies, well pretty much anything that is to do with the Victorian era. Crime stories in the Victorian era are probably some of the best stories ever (just my opinion). Jerome Flynn suited the mercenary type role really well, as he does in anything. All round, this is an amazing series that anyone with a fascination with the Victorian era should watch. This is my first review, so I hope it was helpful and you liked it. Thanks",2013
9,"Ripper Street is a wonderful series, with both brilliant acting and story lines. Although set around the same time as Jack the ripper and references occasionally made, it focuses more on other elements from that time period which is refreshing. I normally do not take much interest in period dramas, however Ripper Street has me hooked 100%! If the BBC do decide to continue down the route of cancellation they will be making a huge mistake,there is a massive fan following for Ripper Street and it would be such a shame to lose one of the best shows on the BBC. There are still many stories that could be told and many characters that could be explored further.",2014
10,"I am so glad that Amazon took over this magnificent show, and after having watched all episodes so far, I have nothing else to say except a huge thank you and I'm looking forward for Season 5. The acting, clothing, police uniforms, pubs, market places, the docks and everything else is very precise. None of the actors mumble their scripts, the accents (for example the Polish English) is perfect. My father who was a policeman, during WW2, would have enjoyed this type of series, as it shows how much the force has progressed since the 1890's. Matthew MacFadyen never stops to top the charts for me as I have followed him through all of his acting career in other shows, but in Ripper Street, he actually lives and breathes the part. Although in season 4 for he gets a demotion, one can still see that he is in full control. As for the Theme Music, couldn't have been better then this choice.",2016
9,"Just caught up with this and admittedly was initially dubious given the earth of literature and movies on this most infamous of unsolved crimes. This series combines strong narrative with detailed period history, never failing to disappoint by bringing in forensics, the development of The Met, social history, criminology all via the strong characters of Reid, Bennett, Rose et al. We see all from Freak Show Victoriana, to Molly Houses, back street abortionists and Music Hall. A lot of work and love...it shows. Sheer craft. The make up for the episode including John Merrick rivals that of Chris Tucker for The Elephant Man and the anatomical post mortem work cold readily compete with the likes of Dexter and Six Feet Under. Simply unmissable and vital viewing for Americans.",2016
10,"This series has absolutely gripped me from the beginning. Set in the grimy Whitechapel area of Victorian London in the immediate aftermath of the Jack the Ripper murders, this show is just flat-out sublime in casting, sets, costumes, period atmosphere, writing, and soundtrack.The hugely underrated Matthew McFadyen is glorious as Detective Inspector Edmund Reid, who is haunted (in more ways than obvious ones) by the unsolved Ripper killings. His colleague , Inspector Bennet Drake, is played to weary perfection by Jerome Flynn, who is thankfully by no means relegated to a secondary ""sidekick"" role. Drake and Reid are joined in their crime-fighting efforts by the American Civil War veteran/physician/medical detective Homer Jackson, who as portrayed by Adam Rothenberg, is a combination of chain-smoking Byronic hero and lab geek. If you're tired of shallow characterizations and inept screen writing masquerading as substantive TV dramas, then this is the show for you!",2015
10,"This show continues to improve each year. Each of the cast members are top notch, including those in supporting roles, but it is Jerome Flynn who truly shines. Set up to be a tragic figure on whose shoulders must reside the weight of each of the several worlds he has to juggle between Whitechapel and his social life. He is a classic Shakespearean angst-ridden hero. The only of the three male leads that can always be counted on, even if doing what needs to be done is to his own detriment. Jerome Flynn seems to have fun in Game of Thrones. In Ripper Street, he is Prometheus unbound.",2015
10,"I cant get enough of British Actors and writers, they kick the poop out of most N.American TV!! Creative period piece with all the juicy crime thriller ""who done it"" that I love. I hear they are coming out with some more seasons but not through BBC some other reality show beat them out??!! OMG what is our world coming to? I love the lead actor,Matthew Macfadyen and admired his work in another period piece he did called Little Doret, which is also excellent but quite different from this. In this Season of Ripper Street I love how the time is right around the Ripper murders but not about them, creating some true life feel to the imagined murders of that day. I am hanging on as every episode ends to get to the next one. I will look to contacting BBC to urge them to sign this show up for another season. If you haven't watched it I encourage you to do so and know you will enjoy every minute!",2014

The Ripper Street follows Detective Inspector Edmund Reid and his the team of detectives based at Leeman Street in the East End Of London. Reid had hunted Jack the Ripper. The Police's failure to catch the infamous serial killer forms a backdrop to the story.

Authentic dirt & dust & sets & props & costuming. Would have helped, and this is consistently true for period movies, if the actors appearances were more authentic, e.g. mottled teeth, splotchy skin, bugs in the hair. Usual twists 'n turns in suspense, crime dramas. Rare 8+ rating from IMDb. ",2015

I don't know why BBC America continues to rerun the most insulting cooking show over and over again ad nausea but doesn't rerun this quality show. I look forward to each Ripper Street episode. When a new show runs, I cannot leave my seat until complete. Like a well written symphony, this show builds with verve and crescendo. The actors are tremendous. More Matthew Macfadyen, please!",2014

I am fortunate not to have seen Matthew MacF in 'Spooks' so have nothing to judge him by. I have liked Jerome Flynn since his 'London's Burning' days and apart from 'Badger' has a pretty good CV in acting (let's also forget his Robson and Jerome days). I have also not seen Adam Rothenberg in anything before. I had been really looking forward to seeing Ripper Street since I first heard of it way back in the Spring, it's been a long wait to see JF back acting and loved him and Peter Dinklage as a kind of double act, so to speak, in Game of Thrones. The problem is that anticipation of that length can foster a doubt as to whether it will be actually any good, so I watched Episode One slightly nervously expecting to be disappointed as British drama has been quite poor of late. Luckily I was not to be disappointed, it was solid and enjoyable, well acted by all the major players and an interesting storyline set in",2013

10,I started this series because of Matthew Macfadyen. I love his acting and thus came upon Ripper Street. I did not regret it the slightest bit. Love how it was done during the Ripper's era and quite interestingly that it is after Ripper's killings where people feared that the killer still to walk amongst them and may still strike at any moment.,2014
10,"Just finished watching Series 3 and I love this show! The whole series story line pulls you in and doesn't want to let you go. I love that Amazon picked this back up and kept it going. Please keep producing this series! I recommend this show to anyone. There is more obvious violence than typically seen on TV but it makes it grittier and more realistic than many other shows. The relationships between the main characters are complex and there is no romanticizing of what life would have been like during this period in this area of London. It is a heavy story line with definitely a dark undertone, however there are moments of brightness. I will definitely watch this show over again.",2016

9,"To those uncertain about The Legend of Korra: watch it. It is every bit as good as the original Avatar series was. Set in a more modern world, the new avatar is faced with struggles of a different kind, struggles that relate more to our modern world. Technology is booming, crime is rising, and a revolution is awakening. This is much more real than the last series was.",2012
10,"The Legend Of Korra is a very worthy successor of the first series. It's a totally different environment, and the circumstances are also entirely different, but you can see that the makers of the series have put a lot of work and effort in the second series. The only downside I can think of is that, because the series will only concludes two seasons, is that, in my opinion, everything's a bit rushed. It's like they want to fit a lot of content into the 2 season time-frame. On the other hand, the series is brilliantly detailed, just like its predecessor, and has it's typical quirky humour. And the tension that they're building up throughout the show is an excellent way of keeping people tethered to their screens and to the series!",2012
4,"...Or at least it shouldn't. I was shocked at the 8.6 rating this show has. Now before we get to the review let me say this: I WATCHED THE FIRST SEASON OF KORRA BEFORE I EVEN TOUCHED THE LAST AIRBENDER SERIES. I had no bias, no expectations. I was drawn to Korra by its beautiful animation, the dark plot, and the 1920s-inspired setting. I had heard of ATLA and had friends who were fans but I myself was never interested until I watched this show. At first, it was looking to be one of the best animated programs on television, perfect for kids and adults alike, but as the season wandered on, the quality plummeted.",2013
10,"When I first watched the series, I thought to myself. The creators of this show must be mad. The amount of Nazi references and injecting political views and ideals into this Nickelodeon show is astounding. This has to be one of the most mature children shows out there. It teaches them to deal with decision making, dealing with loss, sacrifice and how to deal with another Hitler in case one pops up in the future.",2012
8,"The Legend of Korra starts pretty high paced and the new avatar is found fast, in contradiction to the previous series (where they take more time with the intro). This means that the adventure also start fast. Also, note that you should have seen the ""Avatar, the Last Airbender"" before you watch this one.",2012
9,"I enjoyed the previous series, ""The Last Airbender,"" and I had been checking every month or so to see if the new ""Legend of Korra"" had been released yet. Yesterday I realized that five or six episodes had been released so I watched them all while typing up some notes for school. I have to say, the first couple of episodes I was pretty worried. Many of the characters seemed very harsh and unlikable. Yet, as I got to know them better, I really started to like them and enjoy the show. ""Legend of Korra"" is lacking the hilarity which made ""Airbender"" so fun to watch, yet it is replaced with more menace, intrigue, and (I want to use the adjective ""page-turning"") excitement. The bits of humor that are present are perfect and I think they have captured a good balance. I'm really hooked. 9/10. The one missing star is in case the show takes a turn for the worse.",2012
10,"Just watched 2 episodes of Korra.... and I must say it's more than what i expected. Didn't expect the same fun from Korra as last air bender... But Korra turned out to be a lot fun... Though the sequel is set 70 years after the original series, though there's no Aang and the Team Avatar... New Avatar is as much fun, you'll just fall in love with this character.. Last Airbender is been a favorite animation of mine, since i started watching it, back in 2008... I even have this thing, of watching it at least once a year... So i'm just glad that Korra started out to be a perfect sequel for the original series... Animation is better than The Last Airbender and action is brilliantly done... Music just gave goosebumps... So if you are a Last Airbender fan then let's just say that you'll have a big smile on your face while watching Korra... If you are not a fan then still you would have that smile... Korra rocks!!!!",2012
10,"Avatar: Legend of Korra was outstanding. I praise it's in depth and complex story, and it's intriguing plot. Every episode had an element of human emotion that really tied each episode together and kept it interesting. From love and romance, to anger, fear, and moral values being put to the test. Unlike it's predecessor Last Airbender,Legend of Korra was faster progressing, and had less moments of comedy and goofiness that were a bit irrelevant to the story arch. It moved towards the climax of the series faster, making it an unfortunately short, but more satisfying show. This series also had a darker, more mature atmosphere. Scenes of death were more blatant, and happened more often, and the concept of peril and failure were more apparent. It was more realistic to how real life conflict and danger is, the main protagonist actually lost quite a few times. The antagonists were also much more sinister and were more ruthless. The character development was a bit more complex and in depth than Last Airbender. As far as comedy, Legend of Korra relied more on subtle pun and wit based humor, and less slapstick and silliness than in last a Airbender. Legend of Korra focused more on other characters emotional development and relationship with each other and the main protagonist as well, making it identify to an older audience who want more complexity in character development. Legend of Korra focused less on the lead character learning how to be an avatar, mostly because of the lead having more experience in the art of bending, and knowing about being the avatar longer. So the series focused much more on keeping the viewers focus on what the outcome of the story will be, basically making you think ahead and less in the moment of the scenes and the lead character. All in all, i enjoyed Legend of Korra so much, and it had me so drawn in, that i didn't want to watch the final episode because i didn't want it to be over. The emotional context and subject matter was capable of making me tear up and break down, far more than in last Airbender as well, so for people who enjoy lots of complex emotional subject matter, this is a treat for you. I say you watch this series now if you haven't, because you will not regret it.",2015
10,"The Legend of Korra seriously takes some steps into the right direction by throwing in some more or less ""new"" concepts (new as new for Avatar) such as love stories and relationships from the get go and a more ""modern"" world. If you watched the original Avatar (if you didn't go right to it) you may appreciate that, although Korra really has some of Avatar's good old content such as fast-paced element-bender battles, it also feels new and fresh and in no way ""forced"" to be a sequel on it's own. If it really will be as entertaining and as good as the prequel only time can tell but for now (seen 6 episodes so far) the story is more promising than I ever could have imagined it to be. Last but not least I really want to point out the storytelling: If you pay attention you'll notice that the script for this series is much more than just a foolish attempt to catch the fame of ""Avatar"": Many old characters can be ""found"" here, revived as new roles. Great humor and action awaits.",2012
5,"Korra - Creator's pet. Instead of being a goal oriented, focused, good role model for girls like Katara, she has the personality of a 90's Disney princess -- rebellious free-spirit that needs a man to be happy. ",2012
7,"Avatar: The Last Airbender is easily my favorite recent example of western animation, so not only were my expectations high for Korra fairly high. When I first heard that there was going to be a sequel, I couldn't be more excited. The hype and buildup for this show was incredible for a lot of people - a more modern Avatar world with an older, more headstrong female protagonist set in the cultural hub of the world is simply as good as it could possibly get, and for the first few episodes of the series, a lot of great ideas were established and the characters at the time were shown to have great potential for growth and lasting importance. We have a populous cultural capital in an industrial boom, an older, more articulate cast, a plot centralized around themes of equality between benders and non-benders, and some of the most gorgeous animation ever to be featured in a cartoon.",2012
3,"I've waited patiently until the conclusion of TLOK to finally write this review. I am huge fan of ATLAin fact I feel it is one of the best animated series out there and give it a solid 10/10. From the very first episode you are drawn into a world where the story telling and character development are top notch along with some well balanced humor and even a splash of romance. We were able to not only see but also feel the struggles the characters faced and how it changed them. It was a unique series that despite being made for children, appealed greatly to adults as well. Now, let's get back to TLOK.",2014
9,"Legend of Korra appeals to be way more mature than its prequel: The Last Airbender. Whilst that gives an edge to Korra, it also removes that childish and innocent humor enveloped in rather serious conflict. ",2012
9,For the most part I only started watching this because I wanted to see what the final outcome would be of the original series. But after watching the first season I was completely hooked and wanted more. The animation was absolutely stunning and the voices fit their characters extremely well. My only complaint is that the entire season felt rushed. Though it is understandable as it was originally only supposed to be a mini-series of twelve episodes. My only other complaint is that throughout the entire season they don't properly show how powerful Kora really is. While in the original series they showed is with Ang using the avatar state which I always enjoyed as I thought it was quite cool.,2012
3,"Without going at lengths through the accomplishments of the spiritual forefather of this series, let it be noted that A:TLA revolutionized the animated series scene when it came out, a testament to the power of higher-quality animation and good writing. With that in mind, a sequel, with the same people at helm, was a thrilling prospect.",2017
8,"I've always loved Legend of Aang. While the show was kind of childish in a way, it fits right in with the young characters, and all of them are developed well, even though the last season kind of hasten things up near the end.",2012

The humor, the story, the dialogues... there was nothing not to love about it. so when i saw the trailer for legend of korra, saw mechanical machines doing some action and a modern touch to everything, i was bit sceptical that it might not be a thing for me, and watching it might decrease my love for the avatar.",2015
6,"I was, and still am, a HUGE fan of this show's predecessor. I say that because my bias based on my love for the original will no doubt needlessly seep through during this review. ",2016
5,"This series started with a lot of potential. Do not assume this negative review comes from someone who can't ""cope"" with how different this series is from its predecessor. I was prepared for a different world and new themes. But, unfortunately, this series fell way short (at least at this point where season 1 has finished).",2012
3,"I absolutely loved the original series; however, I found this new series to be seriously lacking in substance, and thus extremely disappointing. The show is obviously aimed at teenage audiences, and thus has a lot of unnecessarily angsty romance that wasn't present (or at least more subtle) in the original series. Although the 'bad guys' in the series seem to have a valid cause, they are depicted as almost wholly evil. We don't get to know any of them personally, except the main villain, who is only shown in a sympathetic light once we learn that he's a bender. Most of the ""bad guys"" are faceless, generic goons, and show zero character development. In contrast, in the original series, we are shown the human side of the fire-nation; some members of the fire-nation are good, and even join the protagonists' side. Although the show's premise is interesting and has potential, the main characters are fairly two-dimensional and (in my opinion) not very likable -- especially Mako, who is basically a moody jerk, (unsuccessfully) played off as tormented and mysterious. All in all, definitely a downgrade from the original series. The writers took away any sort of deep meaning that was present in the first series for a short fandom-pleaser. The show also seems very rushed, as the creators only planned to make one series. I don't understand why it has such a high rating.",2012
9,"Let me just say, I was a fan of Avatar: The Last Airbender (mostly Earth and Fire) but Korra tops it without a doubt. The writers and creators have really grown and learned their art, and it shines through in this series. It's darker than it's predecessor, and the story is much more intriguing. ",2012
10,"Wow I was never the fan of Avatar but this show from season 1 got me hooked, initially i thought making avatar a female character was asking the show to be just for the girls but was surprised to find the contrary. First two seasons were good but Man the third season is off the hook, they have infused the element of suspense, Hard core avatar action and awesomeness. Because of the third season turning out to be the best one I have seen I rated this 10. A must watch for animation series fan. Also you don't need to see any previous Avatar to understand this one as this starts off having its own story from the base. Also avatar game will be out very soon i have seen the game trailer and its pretty much similar to the show so yeah there you go",2014
1,"First of all, what the legend of korra did right: amazing art style, old timey feel of the introduction and narration of each episode and giving us hope of expanding the world of the original Avatar series and the stories of the characters we loved. Now the train wreck.",2015
10,"If you were a fan of ATLA (Avatar: The Last Airbender), then this is a must see. This is because some of the characters from ATLA are still seen in parts of the show, plus you get to see their kids and grandchildren. Now, if you weren't a fan of ATLA or you never watched it, don't write LoK off, quite yet. I wasn't a huge fan of ATLA. There were some episodes that I loved, but for the most part, the show just moved too slow for my liking, and what I mean by that is that there wasn't enough action for me. And for those who didn't watch ATLA, you don't need to have seen it, to understand the show. It's better to have seen ATLA because there's references to it and it's just good to know more about how the world is in those shows, but it's not a big deal if you haven't seen it. Anyways, Lok is a great show. I absolutely love it. There's A LOT of action, there's humor, there's a bit of romance, the animation is fantastic, and the storyline is great. I definitely recommend this show. It's a great show for anyone 10+. I'm 19, and many of my friends (who are all 17-23) love the show as well. I know of some parents who enjoy the show as well.",2014
7,"There was a time—let's call it ""The 80s""—when action movies didn't need CGI cheats, shaky-cam and ADD-editing to entertain us. They also didn't have to destroy ten city blocks, have a ""clever"" hook or feel the need to tack on a social message to justify their carnage. No, all they needed was a reason for some good old steak and potatoes action and a star to anchor it all. 2012's Jack Reacher has these qualities in spades.",2013
8,First of all i would like to ask how any of the other reviewers could possibly give this film 1 out of 10? They must have some deep rooted personal reasons for this i guess.,2013
8,Saw JACK REACHER on Monday night at an advance screening. Here's some of my thoughts. There are no spoilers.,2012
10,"I dislike Tom Cruise in general, so I was reluctant to see this movie. I was so worried it would be another asinine Misson Impossible movie. I'm so glad my wife pushed me to see it, as it was terrific. None of the super slo-mo CGI Matrix-type bullsh*t, just a Dirty Harry style movie with a great story and great bad guys and great fights. I don't believe there is any CGI in this movie at all! Amazing! Very old school, very surprising, very well done. I loved it and haven't seen a movie of this type that I enjoyed in a long, long time. I loved the way it ended... Fairly easy to see through the plot and figure out what is going on, but still very enjoyable. This is a MUST see for anyone who loved the Dirty Harry movies, or ones similar. Minimal fluff, no stupid romance, a believable plot and a good car chase. And bad guys killed the way they should be. Fantastic!",2015
9,"Jack Reacher was a surprisingly fantastic film. I went in thinking, thanks to some slightly misleading trailers, that this was going to be a high octane action movie with a bunch of gun fights, car chases, and explosions but little development and quality. I was completely wrong. While there were a few gun fights, one car chase, and an explosion of sorts, it was done in a completely different manner and was more of an action thriller. Tom Cruise did a great job in his typical role. The rest of the supporting cast was solid enough and the cameo by Robert Duvall was awesome. The plot developed really well and made it more of a ""thinking movie"" than I anticipated. That being said, the turns in the plot kept the film from becoming stagnant or boring and the action sequences felt real and authentic. I wasn't a huge fan of some of the cinematic elements and there were some flaws in one of the plot twists but nothing that really hurt the movie-watching experience. All-in-all, I'd say this was a great movie that most people would very much enjoy watching.",2013
8,"Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) is the tale of a very astute ex-military policeman. The army training came in quite handy as he digs into the evidence of a heinous crime that turns out to be not at all what it seems to be on the surface. I was surprised at how funny the dialogue in this film was, it is definitely not a comedy, but the sarcastic and comedic one-liners kept coming, even in situations that were completely devoid of a humorous setting there was some very amusing conversation. There was even a scene in which Reacher is attacked in a bathroom that had me cracking up at the bumbling bad guys. The comedy was heightened even further with the old codger Cash (Robert Duvall). Mr. Duvall always delivers a convincing performance, same here. As with any film that features Mr. Cruise the expectation is that it will be fast paced and very entertaining, same here. The only thing missing was his trademark sprint to or after something or anything. I've just come to expect to see him running, really running but we are getting older. The trailer is the only kind that I like, the ones that do not give away the whole movie. It shows that Reacher is bad a$$ without playing out every aspect of the story. David Oyelowo (Emerson) is one to watch, he is building an impressive resume and it is easy to see why because whenever he portrays a character he is that character. When he played a pilot in Red Tails, I totally believed he could fly a plane. When he was the head of a company experimenting on Apes, I was again thoroughly convinced and I believed every aspect of his being a police detective. One of the best car chase scenes that I've seen lately was in this film. There were so many attributes of this film that I liked, including the sexual tension between Reacher and Helen Ronin (Rosamund Pike) that I will just sum it up by saying. Everything just seemed to be genuine and authentic, even though I know that the fights are staged they looked logistically correct, but Steven Segal did come to mind. I liked that the film had a legitimate beginning and end, even if there are subsequent Jack Reacher tales to follow, there was no gaping wide open door of a final scene leaving the audience wondering 'What's up with that?!?'. But I do hope there are sequels, at least one. I give it a green light",2012
8,"Having never read any Lee Childs novels regarding Jack Reacher, I went into this one with somewhat limited knowledge on who Jack Reacher is and what his claim to fame is. So like many, I read where the ""serious"" fans were disappointed that Tom Cruise was picked to portray this iconic hero. To them I say, so what, did you watch this movie? In truth Tom Cruise is very good in this role, the movie is fast paced and action packed, the writing is cleaver and spot on, so to those who would continue to pan this movie I say lighten up and relax. This was a very good movie, Tom Cruise was good in the lead role, the several one-liners were very cleaver and kept a sense of humor in a plot with plenty of violence and too close for comfort realism. This movie was good, it was entertaining, well acted, and should be viewed and enjoyed by all who watch it.",2013
8,"James Barr (Joseph Sikora), a former military sniper, is in jail for killing 5-people and says he is innocent. He asks for ex-Army MP Officer, Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise). But Reacher knew Barr in Iraq and is out to prove him guilty. Hmmmshould be a slam dunk.",2013
9,"Just saw Jack Reacher. LOVED IT! I thought it was great. There was a lot of action, but it had some great comic relief. Jack Reacher's interaction with everyone bordered heavily on comic relief. There is a scene when Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) is in his hotel room with Helen Rodin (Rosamund Pike) and she asks him to put his shirt on, but he says he only has one. Several minutes later he says it's late and they should get some sleep, Helen mistaken thinks that he is suggesting they sleep together and then realizes her mistake. The whole interaction is very funny but delivered in a straight faced manner, at least on the part of Jack Reacher. Many of Jack Reacher's other encounters throughout the movie are along the same lines as this. The uncomfortable interactions between Reacher and Sandy, played by Alexia Fast, are particularly amusing as all he wants is information and she keeps offering herself to him. After Sandy is killed and Helen is kidnapped the comic relief is done.",2013
8,After putting off watching this film as I usually don't enjoy Tom Cruise I was pleasantly surprised. The film has a good twisting plot and Jack Reacher is a mix between James Bond and John McLane from Die Hard. There are some memorable characters and the film draws you in and makes you think. The plot is easy to follow but complex enough to keep you interested without giving you brain ache. In short I liked Jack Reacher and look forward to more films with Jack. ,2013
9,"5 people are shot dead and incontrovertible evidence leads the police to immediately pick up sniper James Barr, who simply asks for Jack Reacher.

10,"I'd never read any of the Lee Child 'Jack Reacher' novels so I went in with no particular expectations about the portrayal of this character. But this film can certainly live up to ANY expectations thriller fans might have had of it, in my opinion!",2012
7,"Jack Reacher is based on Lee Child's book ""One Shot"". For those who've read it, you already know Tom Cruise isn't right for the role. One would wish they could've gotten a bigger and taller actor to play the role like Hugh Jackman, or Chris Evans, or someone else. It could have been a new iconic appearance for a hero. The real problem is it seems Tom Cruise is just redoing his generic action hero performance. As much as he refuses to call himself a hero, he still looks like one but in a much glossier way. In spite of that, the film itself is a snazzy piece of entertainment that is rare in cinema these days. A neo-noir styled action blockbuster that will grip you by its storytelling and its action scenes. There's a chance that could have made this a much better film but put aside those complains, it's still pretty awesome.",2013
8,"If you can get over the fact that Tom Cruise is no Jack Reacher in stature (in the novels, the character stands out in a crowd, at 6'4' and 240 lbs.), you will enjoy this film. It has a well crafted plot, is expertly filmed and edited, and resists the typical over-the-top shaky-cam effects we see far too often in such movies. I almost didn't go see this film based on many negative reviews I'd read on Rotten Tomatoes....I'm very glad I decided to see it after all. What a pleasant surprise. I believe the political biases of many reviewers turned them off...if you don't believe justice should be merciless and swift, you are probably going to have a problem with this film. But if you enjoyed, say, the Dirty Harry series, then get out and watch this!",2013

When he is transported to prison in a bus, the other prisoners beat him and Barr goes to the hospital in coma. ",2013

7,"Jack Reacher is not hero, or so he would have you believe. He's a loner and he's old school. He travels from town to town, presumably via bus as he has no passport, nor does he have a phone or any other form of communication. He's a bit like Chuck Norris really, you don't find him he finds you, he can beat five guys up and barely break a sweat and he has a very strong sense of right and wrong.",2013
8,"While not entirely original, Jack Reacher is both a competent mystery movie and an exciting action film. In that order. Not much for blending its components, the first three quarters unfolds in an intriguing and serpentine manner, while the last portion focuses rather exclusively on explosive adventure. The whodunit gets left in the dust; but it's still an effective journey regardless of the unceremonious juxtaposition of genres, primarily thanks to leads Tom Cruise and Rosamund Pike. Many of the characters in the film fall squarely in the category of generic, but Cruise and Pike push past their less polished support (like the ""crotchety old man with a heart of gold"" and ""disfigured evil villain"" roles that expectedly pop up) to create worthwhile heroes that deliver a surprising amount of witty banter and clever deducing of miniscule signs.",2012
1,"Awkward Tom Cruise egofest. Has a decent opening up until Cruise appears. he's cooler than cool. He's tougher than tough. And he always walks out of the room so that everyone can run after the cool, angry tough guy and beg him to come back. This is the visualization of very bad pulp fiction. ",2013
10,"Starting with the fact that I don't particularly like Cruise, this movie was terrific. It was understated, the action was realistic and the acting spot-on. Duvall showing up in the second half was a bonus. I say this is the best Tom Cruise movie ever. Well worth watching. The plot unfolds slowly, the action doesn't dominate the movie, and the acting is pure. I was put off by the title at first, the name seemed too theatrical, so I didn't watch it until I had really nothing else to do, but I was completely pleasantly surprised. The bad guys are realistically portrayed, too. They are bad enough that you hope for their demise throughout the movie, and like all good movies, the bad guys get their comeuppance. Good work all around.",2014
7,"Well i like the movie pretty much. The action was good and feasible for man. The motive of killing was not perfect but good. The shuffling of the criminal was also very good. The most adorable thing was sometimes snipers missed the shot and it is very rare in movies. The investigation was something can be called as ""cool"". I was most impressed by the acting of the James Burr. His acting was the best in the whole movie and i hope a bright career for him. The script, the acting and the combination of the artists were great. It was true that whomever has found fun in killing people, he can't stop. It was a nice production by Tom Cruise...",2013
7,"I remember seeing the trailers for ""Jack Reacher"", last year. They sold it as a badass Tom Cruise muscle care beat 'em up. So it probably turned some off when the move wound up being part crime thriller, part '70s action film (no caffeinated editing or shaky cam), methodically paced, and tension that runs at a slow burn. You can always blame the chimps in marketing.",2013
9,"John Carter did not get the attention that it needed! This movie should of been more successful and despite what most of the critics and viewers are saying about this movie, ""that its a lot like Star Wars and Avatar"", that is not true. I have found John Carter to be an amazing movie visually, and the story was actually great. Don't get me wrong, Star Wars and Avatar were great movies, but I believe that John Carter was far much different and slightly better. I saw John Carter in the theaters the week that it came out and I had a lot of fun watching this movie!. So the hell with the critics, in my opinion, John Carter kicked ass!!!!.",2012
10,I have so much to say about this movie but I guess I should start with what or who is John Carter.,2012
8,"I did only have modest expectations of this film as the trailer reminded me a bit to much of Dune. Really surprised to find a film which had a good plot line (albeit cynics will liken it to Avatar-lite), well acted, reasonable characterisations, brilliant visuals and a surprisingly good hero figure in Taylor Kitsch. I saw the preview screening this morning - don't really care how much it cost to make - what I found was a big budget film that I really enjoyed from start to finish. My advice - don't follow the cynics and naysayers - see it for yourself. I will normally not go see 3D films (they give me a headache) but the 3D wasn't too intrusive on this one.",2012
10,"Star Wars, Avatar, and John Carter. That's the cinema progression although by now everyone knows that the John Carter books came first and inspired both Lucas and Cameron. As a devotee of the books -- I appreciated Star Wars and Avatar, but neither produced the level of excitement and reader/viewer loyalty that Edgar Rice Burroughs did with his vivid and unforgettable tales of John Carter, Dejah Thoris, and Barsoom.",2012

9,"Hearing about this Disney film's story sparked my interest in seeing this right away! I finally did and overall, the characters, the setting, and the plot flowed seamlessly well together! It's like Disney's formula of ""Star Wars"" and ""Avatar"" meets ""Prince of Persia: Sands of Time."" ",2012
10,"John Carter is an unjustly dismissed sci-fi masterpiece...grossly unjustified. What was wrong with it? Specifically, what was wrong? Pacing? It was intense!!! Coming from someone who uses this word sparingly, this movie was ""EPIC"". I am almost certain that time will enable objectivity, and objectivity will redeem it from the stinging taint slapped on it due to a predictably simplistic aversion to what is ""mainstream"" by film critics. If a studio other than Disney could have created the same film with half the budget it would have been heralded as a cinematic achievement within the sci-fi genre, but its budget was viewed as ostentatious and its production studio as childish, so it became ""cool"" to hate on it before anyone had even seen it.",2013
8,"Not a movie about Noah Wyle's character from the show ER, but rather one based on a book I've never read titled A Princess of Mars. Originally going to be titled John Carter of Mars, the movie apparently dropped the 'of Mars' to ""make it more appealing to a broader audience"" and this film is supposed to be the origin story ""about a guy *becoming* John Carter of Mars"" - this probably explains why we finally get the originally-intended title of 'John Carter of Mars' at the very end.",2012
10,"In today's culture there's no place for fairy-tales. There's no place for simple but highly imaginative stories with a clear moral message. There's no respect for visionaries, no credit given to those who created fully-blown worlds out of nothing. Everything has to be 'dark', 'gritty', 'real' and morally ambiguous, even dubious. Or simply loud and dumb. There's no place for movies that embody the very thing cinema was invented for: the magical power of limitless imagination.",2016

8,"I am a man of obsessions. For months, a movie I hadn't seen was the thing. Not Peter Jackson's THE HOBBIT, not Joss Whedon's THE AVENGERS, not even the upcoming Sam Mendes directed James Bond movie SKYFALL (which I'm excited about but it hasn't really sunk its hooks into me yet)...",2012
9,"We just saw a pre-release showing of this movie and I had to pick my jaw up off the floor a few times. The movie is simply stunning. While there may be small details to niggle at for the most die-hard Burroughs fans, this is ""inspired by"" a Princess of Mars, it isn't a straight adaptation. The movie is a whirlwind of amazing visuals, powerful dialog and soul-wrenching storytelling.",2012
9,"This is not going to be a long review, there are some great reviews on here and I think they have said all I wanted and more. The thing to hold onto is that despite all the negative hype in the worldwide press, this is one heck of a great movie. I have no idea why any film studio would want to distance themselves from this film, it is fresh in a time when fresh is a very rare thing in the movies. Avatar managed it in heaps and so does John Carter. The story is grand and intriguing, the characters are solid and believable, and the CGI is so good you forget about it. This will become one of my favourite all time movies, it is up there amongst the very best of the genre. ",2012
9,"John Carter of Mars was an epic. A detailed story, written in a time when pulp fiction was a cultural phenomenon like today's epic superhero movies. This is not a wham bam in your face Avengers movie, but a grand epic with a tribute to one of the greatest American writers of his time: Edgar Rice Burroughs.",2012
7,"Oscar winning ""Finding Nemo"" director Andrew Stanton struggles to make Edgar Rice Burroughs' vintage cowboys and aliens epic ""John Carter"" into a spontaneous, larger-than-life, saga about tyranny and rebellion on the Red Planet. Mind you, Asylum Entertainment beat Disney Studios to the punch with its own abysmal adaptation of the Burroughs' novel ""A Princess of Mars"" that recycled just about every genre cliché. Essentially, Disney and Stanton have delivered what looks like a synthesis of ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" and ""Star Wars."" This is one of those sci-fi actioneers with a universe populated by anthropomorphic animals and mythological ""Clash of the Titans"" intermediaries. Burroughs penned his colorful pulp escapism about a century ago in 1912 before stories like it became commonplace. Since Hollywood lacked the computer generated technology to make the world of fantasy appear believable on celluloid, the filmmakers preoccupied themselves with Burroughs' less challenging Tarzan novels. By the time Tinsel town conjured up the technology to produce movies about similar escapades on other worlds, the studios had gone off on their own tangents. In other words, the John Carter novels languished in obscurity, while later epics like ""Star Wars,"" ""Dune,"" and ""Avatar"" emerged and appropriated similar themes. What had been groundbreaking when Burroughs wrote it now looks hackneyed, even though Burroughs forged the formula that others imitated. The cinematic ""John Carter"" gives new meaning to the adage about the first being last. Sadly, too, despite its imaginative special effects, this yarn amounts to another cookie cutter, sci-fi/fantasy melodrama that suffers from a sense of déjà vu.",2012
10,"By my standards, ""must-see"" films are getting to be rather rare. This one is by all means a MUST-SEE for everyone who loves science fiction and/or super heroes! Long before Superman, there was John Carter. Many have very likely forgotten what a resourceful and imaginative writer Edgar Rice Burroughs was. Most people only know he authored the original TARZAN. The movie JOHN CARTER is based on Burroughs' novel, A PRINCESS OF MARS, and his 1911 vision of an advanced civilization on Mars is truly astonishing. Upon seeing this, the first question you will likely ask is, ""How is it no one has filmed this fantastic, mind-blowing, eye-popping, compelling sci-fi adventure saga before?"" Well, there have been a few faint attempts but the true realization of John Carter's magnificent adventures waited patiently for the masterful CGI wizardry of director Andrew Stanton and the 2012 resources of Disney/Pixar. Amazingly, Mr. Stanton shot this heavily CGI-based epic on film! According to the director, he did so simply to see what it was like to make a movie like this on film before film is gone. The experience apparently has made him a fan of the classic motion picture medium and I imagine we will hear more from him on why. Of course I'm not going to give anything away. Suffice it to say that, thankfully, JOHN CARTER is a complete film experience: a suspenseful, dazzling story -- efficiently and superbly told -- with dramatic and unforgettable visuals -- and compelling, moving performances. Lynn Collins is particularly brilliant and beguiling as the exotic and dynamic Martian princess. Throughout the film the detail is extraordinary and the pacing is right on the mark, relentlessly drawing you forward into the wonder of this newly discovered, challenging, turbulent world. What a magnificent adventure saga! Let's put it this way: if you liked Sinbad, you will LOVE John Carter. Thanks to a sure-handed director, an inspired cast, and state of the art technical people, it's a fulfilling experience that I predict will remain with you always -- especially if you are among the young! JOHN CARTER is the ultimate exotic adventure; a masterpiece of cinematic action and pacing.",2012
10,This was an incredible film!!! I don't understand how this film can turn out to be a budget disaster. I saw it last week and was really overwhelmed. It's one of the best in his genre.,2012
10,"There are few movies I walked out of the theater and wanted to go back in. John Carter was definitely one of those movies. It was an easy movie to quickly get in to. The characters felt real, John Carter was a great protagonist with an incredibly sad back-story, and the dog was surprisingly adorable. Also, I never thought I would feel human emotions for big green aliens. Everything; action, special effects, acting, writing, story, music; was seamed together seamlessly. I went in expecting a good movie and received a masterpiece. Definitely made it into my top ten movies of all time. Everyone should see this movie. This is not a film to pass up.",2012
9,"This was without exaggeration the most impressive movie I've ever seen. It's the stuff cinema and 3-D are made for. I experienced it as a partly breathtaking parade of impressive landscapes, panorama shots, aliens, costumes and sets connected by a complex story about power, resistance and of course love that culminates in a clever ending.",2012

Box office flop? Only the goofs will tell you that! For me, it's such a good movie, i've bought it on Blue Ray. It'll sit along side great films and collections ranging from Battlestar Galatica to Stargate to The new episodes of star wars and Dune..",2012
10,"To sum it up, I never had even heard of Edgar Rice Burroughs even though I read a lot of science fiction..., nor did I expect anything from this film before going to it... I hadn't even watched its trailer. I chose to go to it only because I had seen all the other films showing that they were showing on the day.",2012
9,"Edgar Rice Burroughs' ""A Princess of Mars"" just about created the last 50 years of Hollywood blockbusters. Star Wars is SO ripped off of that book... and, of course, practically everything else is ripped off of Star Wars. So it's great that someone finally tackled the one and only original.",2012
10,"The previews looks good but the reviews came in shaky. Still the girls and I wanted to see John Carter. I am so very glad that we did. This was an excellent show! Engaging, moving, exciting, moral lesson and clean family enjoyment. What the movies have been missing for so long. As the scenes rolled by you were reminded of so many of your favorite shows (especially for SciFi fans like this family). You just can't get enough. I hope there are many more parts like Star Wars, Pirates of the Caribbean and Harry Potty. A Part 2 would not be enough. This is movie set up to live on for years to come. The story draws you in and is highly addictive. Just finished watching and already I want more.",2012
10,This film was so good that I joined IMDb just to say it is amazing!,2012
2,"A reasonably competent movies from a technical point of view, but in other respects very misleading.",2012
3,I am severely disappointed in this film for the main reason that we see US movie makers twisting the truth so that they come out looking like heroes. And I am not alone in this. The UK and French governments were quite rightly upset by the movie saying that their embassies had refused to help out the Americans in trouble. The UK embassy took the refugees in at great risk and kept them there until the Iranian guard was getting suspicious. Ben Affleck claims he had the refugees refused because he wanted them to appear to be isolated would be funny if it wasn't so clear that he actually wanted it to be the US who really saved them. At least the movie makers did have the Canadian embassy involved as it had been at the time. The movie should have said at the start that the facts had been changed in the name of drama. Movie makers have a responsibility when making movies based on the truth to let people know what really occurred. When they don't they are actually guilty of trying to change history and worse people believe what they see on the screen. And lastly seeing the guards at the airport chasing the jet in order to try and stop it was absurd. Why didn't they simply shoot at it or have the Iranian air-force force the jet to land. A joke of a movie so far removed from what actually happened and to say its 'based on the truth' really shows just how far the truth gets abused.,2013
2,"I understand it may flatter US patriotism, or recall memories to those who remember the events and I don't even dispute Affleck's directorial and acting skills. However, this is a completely superfluous, empty and desperately predictable movie. The historical inaccuracy has been pointed out by several other reviews: no, things didn't happen that way, the Canadians deserve much more credit in that operation than this portrayal ever shows. Notwithstanding the role of the US in sustaining a puppet dictatorship during the Shah and actively interfering in a sovereign country's domestic politics for decades prior to the events. But this is only a secondary concern: historical accuracy is not the most important factor for a fiction, even when it's based on actual events. What I dispute is how incredibly shallow and predictable the storytelling is: cliché anonymous US CIA antihero agent with issues at home goes to a dangerous place, saves innocent lives, takes risks against orders, comes out victorious to reunite with his family. Who on Earth cares, seriously? And no, the fact that it's based on historical events - and therefore you can't argue with history - is not an answer precisely because the script takes so many liberties with the events. I don't care about the liberties taken with history but I care about the ability to portray convincingly the complexity of human emotions and relationships. There is none here. And make no mistake, a fictitious 2 min car chase at an airport is the closest you ll get to see some emotions (ie. anguish at being killed by the revolutionary guards). The characters come out of a cardboard factory, they have zero critical self-reflection about their own role in interfering with a foreign country's domestic affairs, total solidarity with each other and pure love for their partners. This is a Disney version of human psyche, a dishonest and partial historical account and a debauchery of time, energy and money ill spent. Affleck is an able actor and I hope will prove more convincing in his future efforts as a director, but what really baffles me is not the mediocrity of this film, it's the uncritical enthusiasm of so many for it.",2012
3,Argo is not a particularly great film but tells an interesting story in a somewhat ironic fashion. Ironic because the central tenet of the tale is an imaginary movie and how Hollywood could create a lie to mask the rescue told in a way that is in itself as big a fantasy as the movie for that very rescue.,2013
2,"I was watching this movie with 2 friends and none of us said anything until it was over. While I was watching it something was bothering me but I didn't say anything because I thought the other two were into it, Ben Affleck with a beard doing CIA stuff in 1980 Iran being a sort of archetype of what an cool movie should be these days...",2012
4,This movie was so horrible that I can't even begin to describe it.,2013
1,"In a particular scene, one of the ""hostages"" (one of the escaped Americans from the taken-over Iranian Embassy) is looking outside the window of the safe house, and he sees, right on the street, a guy getting shot... The guy looking out the window has a blank expression, and this sums up the overall suspense and vibe of ARGO that, until the last twenty minutes when the characters are trying to silently escape through the airport, has little momentum and simply goes through the motions.",2012
1,"I watched Argo last night and was very disappointed. It is just a typical Hollywood commercial movie. It is probably entertaining, but definitely not thought-provoking. The directing is just so so. That explains why Ben Affleck did not get nominated for best director. It should not be given the best picture, either. Among the 9 movies nominated, I have watched Lincoln, Les Miserables, Django Unchained, and Life of Pi besides Argo. I must say Argo is the worst one. After 10 years people won't remember it as a must-see in life. ",2013
1,"This movie is so bad, I don't even know where to start. None of it makes any sense. Many basic movie making mistakes make it look like it is done by an amateur film crew. A guy waving a burning US flag, and it is more than obvious that it is CGI burn. An Iranian woman running towards the camera and looking directly into the camera, not even angry, but clearly having fun. In the next shot, from the side, she is gone. That is basic continuity. The head of security for the US embassy out of the blue decides to open the door to 'reason with these people', only to be taken hostage within 5 microseconds. That is beyond stupid. The entire film crew plot never makes any sense and is never put to work, as everything comes down to a security guard at the airport by accident reading about the filming of the movie. Right. What are the chances of him having a magazine on his table, and accidentally stumbling upon just that article ? The guard then calls the office in LA, which had already been shut down, but Goodman and Arkin for some inexplicable reason HAVE to go there in a hurry, even at the expense of ruining the shooting for another movie. What do they want in that office, and why the hurry ? The final car chase at the airport is the low point. There is no way an open jeep can keep up with a commercial airliner at full takeoff speed. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Just another Ben Affleck ego trip, as we are treated to many, many closeups of his face.",2013

2,Where to even begin? Maybe with the positives?,2013
1,"I can't believe how this piece of garbage has been hyped. It's a revisionist hunk of crap that only shows how out of touch Hollywood and the American public really are. The main character, Tony Mendez, was in Iran for 1 and half days. It was the Canadians who created the background story. It was the Canadians who issued the passports. It was Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor that took ALL of the risks. Yet, Ben Affleck seems to think if you tell a lie long enough and to enough stupid people, they'll believe it. After the fiasco that was U-571, you'd think Hollywood would have the decency not to go about spreading such misleading information. Apparently not. I'd give ARGO a zero if it were possible. It's disappointing that it's nominated for an Oscar. Argo - And Ben Affleck - You suck.",2013
1,"It could not be more islamophobic if it tried. I am not saying the Iranian revolution was something pretty. It really wasn't. Here is a list of the disturbing in the portrayal of Iran in Affleck's Argo: -When the Iranian people spoke Farsi in the film there were no English subtitles. If an American spoke farsi there magically appeared subtitles. -Every single Iranian in the film was angry. This was the only emotion they could express. According to Argo all Iranians are hostile. -Showed no culture, not a single educated Iranian of there own right. There was one ""good"" Iranian who was a housekeeper to the Canadian ambassador. No character development at all, she serves her purpose and leaves. Apparently fled to Iraqi cause thats going to end well for her children. -The streets of Iran were made to look like the streets of hell. The streets are shown with either one of these characteristics 1. angry Iranian mob protesters who are in favour of the Khomeini 2. militia terrorizing and murdering it own citizens 3.objectified Iranian dead bodies. Do yourself a favour and rent Persepolsis (2007) written and directed by Iranian refugee and graphic artist Marjane Satrapi.",2012

The fact that it is makes me very very worried about the state the United States is in. Hollywood making propaganda? That's nothing new. The thing is, it used to be genius. It promoted American values, political agendas etc. But this didn't win you a best picture Oscar. The success of American propaganda used to be the result of exceptional talent, creativity, and awesomeness. Think Mickey Mouse. Hollywood created the culture of the 20th century. ",2013

9,"Honestly, I came into this movie with so-so expectations as the trailer I saw in a different movie made me give myself a 50% chance to watch it, up in the air if you will. But from the moment the movie began up until the end, I was gripping for the characters the whole way, the way movies should be.",2012
4,"Let me start by saying as a piece of entertainment Argo is very good. Good acting, good editing, great music and solid direction by Ben Affleck and some great casting (The actors are almost splitting images of the real people concerned, see the films end credits) The attention to visual detail is superb. The reason I'm only giving this film a 4 star rating is the historical inaccuracies. The film only as a postscript acknowledges the Canadian input into the hostage rescue, and this was only added to the film after a test screening. OK the final tense scenes at the airport never happened in real life and that is excusable as it adds nail biting tension to the drama but to depict the rescue as solely a CIA endeavor is inexcusable. This is American cinema at its most disrespectful and nearly as bad as the historical re-write in the film U571 where the Americans claimed to have captured the German Enigma machine whereas in reality the British captured it. Entertainment is an important release in these troubled times but keeping historical accuracy in films is more important IMO. The real story is a triumph over multi national cooperation and has enough meat to make a great film, so why alter the facts? Argo is a good entertaining story but could have been a classic film without the stars & stripes BS.",2014
4,"Pretty much nothing in this film actually happened(time-wise, people- wise, story-wise), so what's left is just the movie at itself. Where Ben Affleck portrays a man with clearly no emotions, the group of six 'escapees' clearly experienced difficulties portraying fear. Add up the classic 'America is the smartest country in the world, and the bad guys have the intelligence no bigger than a pile of (you know what)' and you'll find this movie pretty annoying (like I did). ",2013
10,"After years of being one of those actors that was hit and miss with people, who would have thought he would become one of the most sought after great directors in the industry. After his last film The Town received so much acclaim and award nominations everyone was wondering if it was just a fluke. His latest film Argo takes on the actual events during the Iran Hostage Crisis finds him once again taking on double duties with directing and starring, but can he bring these events to life and create another great film along with it? ",2012
8,"No movie being showcased by this year's Toronto International Film  Festival caught our interest as much as Ben Affleck's directorial  follow up to The Town. Argo, based on a true story and starring  Affleck, Bryan Cranston, John Goodman and Adam Arkin, tells the  astonishingly true story of how a CIA exfiltration specialist attempts  to free six Americans who have taken shelter in the home of the  Canadian Ambassador during the Iranian hostage crisis.  The story opens on November 4, 1979 when Islamist militants took  control of the U.S. Embassy in Iran. 52 Americans were taken hostage  and held for 444 days until their eventual release. But six American's  were able to sneak out of the Embassy and find refuge unbeknownst to  the Iranian rebels. The CIA, lead by agent Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck)  hatched a plan to rescue the house entrapped Americans by posing as  producers of a fictional science fiction film. The idea was that Mendez  would land in Iran and then convince the six Americans to assume roles  as screenwriters, directors and co-producers of the film and they would  all fly out of the country together once location scouting was complete  in 48 hours.  In an effort to have the mission legitimized, Mendez recruited  Hollywood producer Lester Siegel and Special Effects man John Chambers  to green-light the script and give the entire project credibility.  If the entire notion of the plan sounds like something that only  Hollywood could come up with  well, you're half right. But Affleck  sticks to the facts of the true events and ravels a bite-your-nails  type thriller that is guaranteed to be rewarded with year-end  nominations for Best Picture, Best Director and most certainly Best  Supporting Actor for Alan Arkin.  Every note, every frame of Argo looks authentic. Affleck, who received  incredible support for his last directorial effort, The Town, ups the  ante and films Argo with the confidence of a maestro at the top of his  game.  The movie shifts between locations of Iran, Hollywood and both the CIA  Headquarters and even the White House in this brilliantly crafted  adventure. Each scene and character oozes with atmosphere and purpose  and Affleck confidently and flawlessly directs himself as the expected  hero of the film  a man who risks his own life and career for the  lives of six strangers.  Towards the concluding chapters of the film, audiences are sure to be  on the edge of their seats  even if they are aware of the historically  recorded outcome (shades of Apollo 13). Once the rescue attempt his its  apex, the audience at the Toronto screening erupted in an applause  never before experienced by this reviewer in his thousands of  theatrical screenings. That reaction is a testament to Affleck's  direction that grabbed audiences by the emotional drawstrings keeping  us involved in our character's fates and caring for their safe return.  Argo is not only an important piece of history that many of us were  completely oblivious  but it is also one of the better films of this  or the past few years.",2012
5,"I'm very much anti-remake. If the original worked, leave it alone. In the case of the 1990 Total Recall we had what was built to be the biggest movie yet made starring the biggest movie star around. Yep, that sounds like a viable candidate for remaking.",2012
7,"When I heard the news that Total Recall was being remade, I was just as disappointed as most were out there. However, I never hate a film based on such a simple principle. Before the release, I was simply curious as to what direction they were going to take with this film.",2012
5,"Fond memories of Paul Verhoeven's ""Total Recall"" kept coming back while watching this remake. Arnold Schwarzenegger's screen presence was also an added plus in the 1990 film, as well as the one-liners, Mars and of course heaps of bloody violence. If you've seen the original, then you know how it goes.",2012
4,"The thing that made the old Total Recall so great was that it kept a certain level of fun going throughout the whole film. It threw Doug Quaid through several crazy challenges and turnarounds in the story. It was enjoyable to watch, and totally intrigued the viewer. It was campy. It was, all in all, a great movie.",2012
2,This movie is one of those remakes which is not as good as the original 90s version. In other words it was pointless.,2012
7,"I guess the floodgates are now open. Adapting Philip K. Dick's stories are no longer enough, and now a trend may follow either to remake the films that have already been done, to give it another spin for a new generation, or how about remaking all of the films starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, starting from Conan, and now Total Recall. For sure, Colin Farrell can't step into the ex-Mr Universe's hulking frame in playing the construction worker turned double agent Douglas Quaid through what would seem like a fantasy walk in the park for the mind gone all wrong, but if you'd put away your memory of the past film, then his outing here would stand out against his recent slate of projects, bringing him back to action-hero mould even if Len Wiseman's vision here turned a little bit suspect.",2012
1,"The acting was mediocre. In one scene I even felt an actor was having difficulty with his lines and that's annoying! What's even more annoying is that the main ""bad guy"" is a depraved, Teflon-coated, wonder woman who can easily beat the stuffing out of our hero, despite the fact he also happens to be a professionally trained killer with muscles the size of bowling balls. Throughout the entire movie, this wonder woman just keeps coming back like a pesty stalker. Hardly getting a scratch until the very end. I was even waiting for her to start talking like Clint Eastwood! She also enjoyed explaining herself too much and I was really hoping she would get dispatched ASAP because her presence was undermining the entire story!",2012
3,"I wish I could recall the last two hours of my life. I really thought this movie would be fun - not good, mind you - but fun. A re-make of an old classic with an even bigger budget, better actors, and today's special effects would be worth 8 bucks. Plus Jessica Biel is sexy as hell. I was rewarded for my rare optimism by poor acting (seriously, the robots were more engaging); cliché dialogue (at one point, the villain actually said darkly, ""Go handle it"" to his henchman); and unpredictable plot-turns (the audience was kept guessing what the hell was going on). And these were all carefully scripted for the sole purpose of getting to the next action sequence - none of which had anything to do with the original movie. The only call-back to the original title was the appearance triple-titted hooker. No need to explain how the hell a regular human came to have these mammoth milk-monsters, because there are three of them. I should have walked out after they made their five-second cameo. I would have been happier.",2012
4,"I was completely exhausted after seeing this film. If you like chase scenes and a lot of action, then this is the film for you. I think that people who have seen the original Schwarzenegger version will not be too thrilled with this film, me included. In the original film there were more mind games while this film is diluted with action sequences. I am not saying that the action parts were not good, there was just too many of them. I have to say that the futuristic look of the United Federation of Britain and The Colony (Australia) was pretty cool; although there were times that I thought that I was watching a video game. Also, the concept that you could travel between the two locations (which are on opposite sides of the earth) in roughly 17 minutes in a tube called ""The Fall"" was utterly ridiculous. I can't even imagine how fast that thing would have to travel to do what it does. Colin Farrell (Douglas Quaid/Hauser) was not all that engaging. This is not necessarily his fault because the dialog was pretty bland and boring. By the end of the film I really did not care what happened to him, I just wanted it to be over. Kate Beckinsale (Lori Quaid) and Jessica Biel (Melina) were formidable as two butt-kicking adversaries, although I have to say that Kate's character kind of reminded me of the female terminator. She was relentless in trying to track down Hauser. I am always happy to see a woman cast as a tough, larger than life super human. Bokeem Woodbine (Harry) was convincing enough as the best friend, but his dialog was no better than Colin's. I do not think that the film was all bad, but about an hour or so into the film I was wishing that I was back at ReKall. You are definitely going to need an energy drink after you watch this one because you will not be energized after seeing it; you will be worn out. Len Wiseman was definitely not a wise man for trying to redo this film. He should stick with the Underworld series and call it a day. This film really makes me long for Mars and the cheesy special effects in the original. I am giving this film a very weak amber light only because the action scenes were so well done.",2012
9,"Too many reviews comparing it to the 1990 film with Arnie. If the Arnie version was never put out, then everyone would be saying how great this adaptation really is in it's own merit. (And seriously can you really say that you would have given the Arnie version a 10 if you saw it today, come on now).",2012
7,I wasn't expecting much from this movie at the start. I had not watched the original movie (with Arnold Schwarzenegger) so I didn't really know what the story was. I was expecting an overdose of action and a confusing plot.,2013
7,This film is an action fans wet dream. It steams from action scene to action scene with a small pause for dialogue and plot. There's many will say this is a bad thing but not me. I hate long drawn out rhetoric in an action film. So if you like action in your action films you will love this.,2012
10,"Well, reviewing this movie can be quite difficult... How am I supposed to evaluate it? As a stand-alone movie or as a remake? Because if you are not falling from, um, Mars you probably know this is a remake of one of the best Arnold Schwarzenegger movies ever...",2012
8,"Before seeing this movie, I read many reviews. Many of them were giving this film a poor rating, stating that it doesn't come close to the original, stating that it doesn't have this or that, etc. I decided to ignore the reviews and form my own opinion of the movie - which is what you should do as well...",2012
8,"What can i say, i really enjoyed this movie. There are similarities to the original but the new twist was very entertaining. It is definitely a special effects lovers dream come true. ",2012
1,"I don't typically review many movies, but I felt compelled to warn people about this film. My husband, 14 year-old son and I have very different movie preferences but we were all looking forward to seeing this film. None of us liked it. The worst part about it was that there was sooo much going on in virtually every scene that it actually became irritating to watch. Too many special effects can detract from a film and this movie was crammed with so much ""action"" that it was just complete overkill. Granted, it has been quite a while since I saw the original, but I remember there being at least some amusing parts and I felt some connection to the main character- not so with the re-make. I could also follow the plot and thought it was better developed in the previous version.",2012
1,It's truly awful and you will need a trip to Rekall after watching it to wipe this horribly dull film from your mind after you have seen it.,2012

1,"Total Recall - What a waste of money and talent! Unfortunately, none of these 2 aspects are a part of this film.",2012
1,"I think the other reviewers here were too kind. The movie is unforgivably terrible. No storyline, no dialogue to speak of other than almost-verbatim regurgitations from the original film, poorly acted, and utterly boring. I couldn't wait for the drawn-out affair to end.",2012

3,"Comparing this film to the original Total Recall would be like saying the phantom menace was the best star wars movie ever. This film simply bored me to tears, and I like action movies. Even removing the back history of the original, I can't believe they let this one reach the theaters with its thin plot line and unoriginal action sequences.",2012
10,"Two stunning brunettes that oozed sex appeal throughout. What more could a man want in an action film. Jessica and Kate were stunning throughout, with looks that made my heart skip a beat.",2012
8,"Okay, a few years ago I rewatched the Arnold Schwarzenegger-Paul Verhoeven version of Total Recall and gave it 10 stars. So I just now watched the Colin Farrell-Kate Beckinsale-Jessica Biel version and while I still prefer the previous version, this one wasn't so bad either. I mean, there are hardly any one-liners that Arnold did like that ""divorce"" line he gave to Sharon Stone then but there is still that dangerous edge that the original had that made this a worthy remake to watch. And the ending also provided a different twist than that of the original so that was also a good thing for me. So to make comparisons, I still prefer the Arnold version but this Total Recall gets a recommendation from me as well.",2012
3,"So right off the bat, let me get this out there, yes I'm a guy and I know this is Lifetime ""Television for woman."" Okay now that that's out of the way, secondly I'm married and have two girls, hence I don't control the TV much before 10pm and my wife and daughters watch a fair amount of Lifetime and either I'm tuned in or out (actually it's somewhere in between if I'm to be at all involved), but I saw many previews for the Client list and that was enough to peak my interest. So the Client list, aired on Lifetime for reasons which I'm still trying to comprehend although yes I do realize the movie was put out by them and rightfully so as it's within their target demographics, but a series, really?",2012
6,"I'm already developing a sort of love/hate relationship with this show. The love part is with Jennifer Love Hewitt, especially with the way she is so good at creating warm, likable and lovable characters. That's a big plus for me because I just finished watching the first (and probably the last) season of Ringer only to never attain that feeling of empathy or connection with the characters. Riley is very easy to like and feel a connection with. I also like and care about the other characters on the show, her coworkers and her mother (played by Cybill Sheperd). I also like the premise of the show which is about a single mother trying figure out how to provide on her own and going into prostitution as a means to do that which has to be a common issue for some single mothers.",2012
2,"I gave this show 2 stars for the cast and lifetime's attempt to objectify men. It's just totally unrealistic in every aspect & not even funny enough to be a comedy. Perhaps it's time for a new genre like Unrealistic/Fictional/Drama. Imagine a massage parlor where very hot guys go for happy endings from not so prime looking masseuses and the undesirable looking people go for just a therapeutic massage. Sadly all the other plots and character personalities are inconceivable. I guess it's a lack of creativity with emphasis just being placed on what they think women want to watch. Surely they could have put some thought and discussion into the production. Then it might have been a great show. Such a great disappointment and abuse of talent! But if you really need to see Colin Egglesfield, even if it's just a little, then why not watch.",2012
2,I love Jennifer Love Hewitt. I think she's great. How has she sunk so low???,2012
2,I couldn't get through the pilot because this show is a joke. Let me sum it up to you. First of all what do we learn about prostitution:,2012
3,"The idea was good but the show is totally artificial (for example all her clients are 25 years old body-builders/models), and not even the always great Loretta Devine can save the show. ",2014
8,"I was never big on watching TV series, but then I got a Netflix account and took a chance to watch one episode of this.. I liked it, so continued to next ep and then I was so engaged with the story, I ended up watching entire S1 and S2 within record two days!! I never expected I would ever spending literally hours watching any TV series like this.. but it happened with this one. needless to say, I liked this series a lot. In particular, I liked the strong character played by JLH. She totally delivered in the performance.. and so did the other supporting actors. The overall story is OKish if I think of it now, but what really made the difference was how the story was told/unfolded/delivered. The last few episodes in S2 were really gripping and kept the suspense going till last minute of S02E15. JLH is one damn hot babe, with a sensual yet a pleasing/lovely demeanor. I thoroughly enjoyed the series. It's pity that the series ended abruptly, so taking 2 points away for that.",2016
9,"Yes it is a bit exploitative with the one of the sexiest women on TV Jennifer Love Hewitt in various stages of undress and in provocative outfits in every episode. Yes it is a ""Hooker with a heart of Gold"" story with JLH dispensing her Ghost Whisperer help and advice to her clients. Yes her clients are all unrealistically attractive guys - why would these type of guys have to pay for it! But whatever the detractors say, it is an enjoyable show and the guilty pleasure of this season. There is enough excitement in the story to keep it going. Every week waiting to see whether they are busted and hoping they get away. The on going forbidden love of JLH by her brother in law. All this led by the one and only Jennifer Love Hewitt with the face of an angel and body of a goddess. It's an adorable show and very entertaining.",2012
6,"I really miss Ghost Whisperer and was happy to see Jennifer Love Hewitt in another series. This show to me has a very similar vibe to Ghost Whisperer, but instead of ghosts being gently coaxed to go into the light, gorgeous men are coaxed to find a life outside paid sex, whether that be in the form of working on their marriage or ending their workaholic ways. Guess that's a little like going into the light. ",2012
2,"I gave it a 2 only because I like some of the actors. I like JLH however this show is dumb. It's as if it was a show wrapped around someone that just can't seem to get enough of herself. ""oh look at me, I'm so adorable"". I wonder if she produced it. I think this because she is the only ""hot"" woman on the show. You would think that in a ""happy ending"" massage parlor all of the women would be hot. But no, you have a large woman running it, an older lady, a very average young girl, another woman that is a total bitch and nothing to look at, and JLH's best friend is a heavier girl. I tried to like it because I like her, but it's a total waste of an hour. Come on Jennifer, you can do better.",2012
5,"In ""The Client's list"", we have the economy -crisis- as a severe background but a housewife who seems really compelled to buy non essential things. I can understand the difficulties of that family but why the big SUV, the new boots, and apparently the new kitchen: didn't she hear about savings? So that situation leaves her with no other choices than to accept to be a masseuse (despite the strange definition of the job) and put aside her apparent morality... And what about her so-called clients! all so wealthy and good looking! because everyone knows than the ugly ones don't have the same needs than the first category... Seriously!?! Do i have to add that i'm not convinced by the relationships being developed between all the protagonists... none of the characters seems to act natural but trying to enter a category: you have the brave strong mother, her cheerful friend, her tormented brother-in-law, the jealous co-worker... Finally what do we get of that show? a remedy to financial crisis: moral crisis! or how to flip a problem for a new one... I don't advise that show except if you're looking for something easy to process, you just have to watch and you will forget it!",2012
7,"As a huge lifetime channel fan, and a big Jennifer Love Hewitt fan I was happy when I heard they were making this show.",2012
10,"I loved this series, So sad the series ended. Was not expecting to get hooked so quickly on this kind of series. I usually get into the more supernaturally inclined series. ",2017
5,"I started (and finished) the show for one reason and one reason only: Jennifer Love Hewitt. In fact, it's the same reason I started ""Party of Five"", not realising that she only shows up in the second season, so I watched almost 17 hours of television just to familiarise myself with the show before I got to what I wanted to watch. I don't necessarily think she's a great actress, but I like to see her, so I gave the show a shot. It is not that bad, but oh my dear God it is not great either. I'm surprised it lasted two entire seasons, because honestly there isn't enough material in this show for a feature length film. I wouldn't really recommend watching more than the first episode if all you want out of this show is to see a bit of Texas and Jennifer Love Hewitt.",2017
9,This show is a prime example of how good and honest people who will do anything for their family can easily get caught up in doing the wrong thing. What's worse is when you get comfortable doing the wrong thing because you can't turn down the money and you think it's helping. So many people get mixed up in life altering mistakes and this story is just one of them. Only thing I hated was that it ended unfinished. Very worth the watch however. I enjoyed it thoroughly!,2017
10,"Wow! Not the kind of TVShows I am used to, I mean, I'm not a fan of Lifetime and it's series for women, but this definitely caught my attention. First of all because of Hewitt, who I love in movies/series and really admire. It's true, this series did not start up that awesome, but it got better and better, and it keeps getting so. For example the last 2 episode, one left till the finale and it's looking awesome. I just love the dialogs, and the way at the end it teaches you something, about life, about people, cause I believe that's what cinema is, it tells you a story or presents a situation that either teaches you something or makes you wonder about something... and The Client List does just that; Yeah! I loved the film too, and it was hard at the beginning to deal with the changes, but Hewitt and the writers make it all worth. I just love the fights between Riley ans Selena, I can feel the fire they are both putting into it, and as much as I hate Serena's character I admit that girl is doing a great job.",2012
9,"We're only two episodes in, and I personally, love it. People, what do you expect? It's LIFETIME (TELEVISION FOR WOMEN) What do women want, honestly? Half naked me with glistening, beautiful chests and arms. Win.",2012
4,"I gave it 4 starts because even though I like the show I can't really get into it because of how phony the writing is at times to benefit JLH. The storyline can draw you in but only to a point because JLH is always getting told how ""beautiful"" she is, making it very corny. It gets old real quick. It must be produced by her because in every single episode they have to throw in the whole town fawning all over her like she's Angelina Jolie and not the girl next door that she is. Its weird. Like other reviews have mentioned...the rest of the cast is below average in looks to make JLH's average looks go farther. Except for her BFF, she's beautiful, but a bigger girl, so I guess she's safe for JLH to act opposite of. The drama and her hectic life is very well written...if they can stop treating her character like the hottest thing to ever walk the Earth and get beautiful women to act opposite her like any other show not produced by her would have, they really will have a good show.",2013
6,"I read some of the reviews before watching and I would not have watched it except that I like Jennifer Love Hewitt. So I decided to give it a try. Now, I'm not an experience reviewer but, it's not true that the acting and the script are awful. Yes, maybe not award winning but I found it engaging and interesting. Character development is good. I felt empathy for the main character and her struggles. It's a metaphor for ""anything that can go wrong, will"". Yes, I found it a little ridiculous that all her clients were hotties but I got over that. I feel some of the reviews are plain hateful. The ""don't waste your time"" and ""avoid at all cost"" comments are totally off. So, the bottom line, it's worth a try, if you don't like it after one episode, you only wasted one hour.",2017
10,"Wow! What a series, I absolutely love Jennifer Love Hewitt and she plays a brilliant part in this very short lived series.",2017
6,"I would have given this series a 9 but I was SO TERRIBLY disappointed with the ending. I am uncertain if perhaps the writers thought there was going to be another season or maybe they just got tired of their job & said ""OK, we're done. We'll just kinda throw this together and end it."" They had a great series going that showed great potential for a long running series. Great cast of characters with some good acting. occasional minor plot goofs but hey it's a movie.",2017
3,"I just couldn't buy Jennifer Love Hewitt as a prostitute, so I had to quit watching. It seemed far too scripted and contrived to be plausible enough. It felt like an after school special on prostitution. Jennifer Love Hewitt was out of her acting range and unable to pull this one off.",2017
1,Produced by church of Orthodox saints who are so scared of sex that they get red faced just by the reference of sex .,2017
6,It began good but soon it became a bit silly. Only good looking guys were clients? Husband left and off course returned with some bs reason. Jennifer love Hewitt is acting like always but I did like the Selena character and I live Henry! All taken I think it is an OK show. The storyline has potential but it s a shame it stays a bit blank.,2017
8,"Mr. Korine is a strangely unique director that uses this film to bore you into understanding how a generation growing up with MTV and girls gone wild has deeply mutilated the pursuit of happiness with nihilistic extremity — however his satirical exploration leaves you uncertain whether to laugh, cry out in horror, or stare in disbelief at its overwhelmingly artistic beauty.",2013
7,"Spring Breakers highlights the mindless popular culture that surrounds youth of this generation. The reason for its controversy stems from the fact that its target audience found its plot to be pointless, even though that was the point. This film depicts the shallowness of the modern definition of what is 'cool', like idolizing people that suck, those that contribute nothing to society but cheap entertainment. This sort of fascination blindly controls youth, the main reason so many did not understand the meaning behind this movie: they are blind to its influences. They think week long drinking binges, whoring themselves out, and having no goals is cool, because YOLO. However, this film is based off of these components and its audience deems the plot as pointless. Funny. Spring Breakers is like this generation looking itself directly in the mirror. ",2013
9,I don't even know where to begin...,2013
8,"I have to say, that watching this movie was a total spur of the moment decision on my part and I walked into this completely unaware of what I was getting into. While watching it, I felt my senses were assaulted, but there was more to it than what I was able to discern viscerally. Therein lies the greatness of this movie. It makes you think about what images are being thrown at you and why. The image is obviously that of what the youth of our age are sold as 'the good life': money, drugs, sex and partying. This is the American Dream. This movie follows 4 girls who do despicable acts, who behave with such depravity and who are shallow to the core, that watching this can be painful at times. But that is the whole point and people who walk out of this feeling as though they have had their time robbed of them or are too disgusted by what they see are missing the point. I am not an elitist movie critic in no sense of the word either, but I know a shock movie when I see one.",2013

10,"I can't describe the elation I felt leaving Spring Breakers--truly one of the best films to hit mainstream cinemas in a long time. It was a breath of fresh air amidst all the cookie cutter romantic comedies, dramas, action films, and horror movies that plague modern cinema. The stamp of a good film is the impact factor--how long it stays with you when it's over. Spring Breakers was a film that stayed with me long after leaving the theater. It didn't evaporate from my mind as soon as I hit the parking lot. This film affects you and leaves you in a mood long after the credits appear.",2013

2,"I rarely write reviews it's been ages since the last one but am writing this to vent out some frustration. To think this film currently has a 6.3 rating and generally favourable reviews elsewhere is really strange. There is booze, sex and drugs but you need something of substance to make even a half decent film, this doesn't even come close.",2013
1,"I was a big fan of ""Kids"" and expected the same amount of intellectually subtle social commentary in this movie. I could not wait to get out of the theater.. If I had not paid so much for my ticket, I would have gotten up and left halfway through the movie. IT IS AWFUL! It is astonishing to me that this generation finds a movie this horribly scripted, filmed, and thought-out to be good. It is not controversial, racy, or thought- provoking. It gives no insight, message, or underlying theme. It isn't that I do not like controversial, bad-ass, or vulgar films.. I do. This film offered none of that! I love films that give insight into a generation or group of people that others do not generally interact with; but this movie did not even accurately portray these things. I want this movie to get buried forever.",2013
5,"This is a strange film. On the one hand, it looks likes an extended music video, filled with mindless scenes of teenagers having one big party. On the other hand, there's clearly more to it. Some characters are so one-dimensional and cartoon-like, that the whole film becomes a sort of mockery of the modern teenage culture. This ambiguity is very clever, because the film appeals to a teenage audience as well as to the art-house audience Harmony Korine is usually associated with. ",2013
1,"This was a terrible movie and I cannot I believe i wasted 94 minutes of my life watching it. The acting was terrible and all you see is boobs and naked butt. There is no plot and no reason to watch it. If you want to waste time you could do it doing anything but watching this stupid movie. I thought that since this movie had a lot of well known actors like James Franco, Selena Gomez, Ashley Benson, and Vanessa Hudgens that it would have some sort of quality but I was wrong. After completing this movie I sat in silence for 10 minutes wondering that it was that I just watched. It just kept dragging and dragging for no reason. There is no way to write a summary to this movie because the movie has no substance. I cannot believe this movie even came out in theaters, it is one of those movies that should have gone straight to DVD. Looks like a horny teenage boy wrote out his fantasy and turned it into a movie.",2013
10,"This film is not a normal movie. It is an acid trip work of art. Korine is truly brilliant, somehow creating a work that is both luscious and devoid. Fantastic acting throughout the lead roles, highlighted by Franco's truly amazing performance as Alien, extends the movie further, and the portrayal of the characters is definitely more important than the actions. The movie not about Spring Break. It isn't about robbery. It is about emotion, change, and the beauty that comes from apathetic destruction. It truly is more of a psychotic documentary than the drama that it is made out to be, and the result is beautiful.",2013
1,"I have seen a lot of movies in my life. I very rarely regret seeing them. I wasted 94 minutes of my life watching spring breakers. This movie did not have a plot. At first they were in college complaining about being from a small town. All of a sudden they were in Florida hanging out with some guy named alien, while he's deep throating gun silencers. Selena Gomez goes home after like 30 minutes, and one girl gets shot in the arm. Then, the two of the girls still hang out with James Franco, and end up killing Gucci mane in the end. Anyone who gave this movie a good review should has horrible taste in movies. How anyone thought this movie was good eludes me. People were laughing in the theater, and this wasn't supposed to be a comedy. See a good movie instead, I wish I could have those 94 minutes of my life back. I could've been bettering myself, running for president, or riding unicorns, instead of watching Vanessa hudgens wear a pink ski mask and shoot Gucci mane in the head",2013
1,This is the worst movie I have ever watched on the big screen. This is my first review for a movie and I am sharing my opinion towards this movie because I don't want anyone to waste their time watching this.,2013
6,An interesting film.,2013
1,"You ever had that feeling where you cannot wait for something to end and feel like tearing your own eyes out? if not then I highly recommend this hour and a half orgy of neon lights, dub step, drugs, boobs and James Franco being gangsta. ",2013
8,"Understandably, the film wakes much rejection. A quick view or not reflective enough can mislead us to believe that it is superficial. On the contrary, Harmony Korine's film is a bitter satire (at times cynical) about the American youth culture and, in large part, global. The shallowness of the characters is deliberate. The three crazy travelers do evil in pure boredom, the banality of evil is presented here in an ironic contrast to the free and unlimited sexuality and drug use, the Holy Grial of these girls. At times, the three chicks seem the witches of Macbeth, messengers of death and emptiness. Harmony Korine is a moralist, his film denounces the horror that lurks behind the glamour of drugs and free love. But Korine delivers his message with a style that copies and reproduces the mechanisms of fashion, so that a teenager is attracted yet shocked by what you see on the screen. Watching this movie, it is impossible not to remember Less Than Zero, the novel that enabled Bret Easton Ellis earn his place under the California sun. The state of affairs is certainly catastrophic for Korine: a. The pursuit of happiness is reduced to get lost in a perpetual orgy. b. The perpetual orgy is slightly threatened only by religious zealots as the only challenging force. c. No more parents and adults, no more institutions concerned with the physical and mental health of its citizens. d. Youngsters' paradise is depicted as one of the many faces of hell.",2013
1,"First of all this movie was made by the guy who made Trash Humpers, so if you liked that movie you might like this one. The writing in this movie is terrible and makes no sense at all. Selena Gomez is supposed to be a very Christian girl with high morals and ends up drinking tons of alcohol, does drugs, and encourages robbery. She then tells her Grandma that she should come with her to spring break next year implying that she should drink do drugs and have sex with random people too. Selena Gomez is trying to find out who she really is during spring break and that turns out to be a drunk slut. Her friends however are far worse and apparently are now cold blooded killers. These girls in college could have a good future but decide they want to have sex with James Franco and get money in any way possible. One girl gets shot and gets afraid and goes home and the other two decide to stay. I guess they don't care if they are going to die or not. These two girls then tell their parents over the phone that they want to turn their life around and start being good people is the secret to being happy thus implying that they'll go home and start listening to their own advice and get a better life. They then proceed to magically kill tons of people with guns from a gang and steal a very expensive car. The most annoying part of this movie is the repetitiveness of everything James Franco says. That ""Spring Break"" line that he keeps saying that I'm sure Korine finds haunting just sounds ridiculous and annoying. I'm not sure what the message of this movie is because nothing in it makes sense and nothing is consistent. I can't tell if Korine is advocating completely hedonistic life-styles or not because while some of the girls feel bad and go back their ""boring lives"" the last two girls get let off with no consequence what-so-ever. This movie to me just seems like a pretentious piece of s**t. That uses a somewhat interesting premise and unique cinematography to fool the audience that more is being said with this movie than there is.",2013
8,"An allegory of our depressed, mostly materialistic, youth culture and it's mutation into a self destructive acid wave. ",2013
1,"I will be short and sweet. One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Same scenes and sentences all over again and zero story. James Franco obviously had a lot of fun filming this. I can not write about acting of other so-called actresses in this movie because there was none, they all stood all the time with blank expressions on their faces, looking brain dead. What a waste of time. I have watched it until end only to see will these stupid girls get some sense in them, big surprise, no they didn't. I don't have anything else to say about this pointless movie, maybe some advice if you want to see movie full of violence with a story and a point go rent Natural born killers.",2013
1,Spring Breakers tries so hard to be like Natural Born Killers. It tries the hyper-violent fantastical approach. It tries the over-the-top approach. It tries the fever-dream visuals. It tries to have characters worth caring about but it fails in so many ways.,2013
1,"Spring Breakers is a film that'a shear intention is to tick anyone off who wastes 9.50 on it at the local theater. The acting is extremely under-par, the story line isn't really that good, the constant repeat of the same scenes over and over gives the movie a budget film feel, and quite frankly it makes you wonder if the producers made this movie for someone with downs. James Franco has forever been banned from my film collection for even agreeing to do this movie let alone the horrible acting he did in it. I've never given a film 1 star before... But believe me, spring breakers earned it. I highly recommend seeing this when they throw it on Netflix in the coming months just to see what this generation deems a ""6 out of 10"" or above. America, we have serious problems.",2013
1,"I really really really wanted to like this movie, but it was so awful. I had never seen a trailer for this movie and assumed it would involve sex drugs and parties, that's spring break, I had NO idea it would turn into what it did. These four girls go to Florida after robbing a restaurant and after being arrested in Florida James Franco, in his most absolute horrible role, takes them under his wing. Selena Gomez decides to go home, so now we have 3 girls left. At one point they are dancing with assault riffles with pink ski masks? In the end two of the girls who apparently have incredible aim with guns shoot up an entire party and kill Gucci Mane. The ENTIRE movie James Franco is in the back noise saying ""spring break y'all, spring break forever"" the movie repeats lines constantly and there is no story like. If you honestly took out all the unnecessary use of girls with breasts out and ten minutes of a threesome, the movie wouldn't last more than 30 minutes. I have honestly never seen anything so god awful and I wonder why any of these actors took up this movie because I would be embarrassed. And what's worse is actual critics praise it for being different. It's not different, it's unkempt. It's messy and ridiculously unrealistic.

2,"When I purchased my ticket to see Spring Breakers, the girl at the counter issued a verbal warning that the movie contained ""Much nudity, sex and violence."" ""Keep going,"" I replied. ""You got my attention."" She should've instead warned that this movie is a bring-down. At first, it's like a high-quality version of the Girls Gone Wild videos. Stunningly-beautiful examples of young American womanhood getting it on, and it's superbly filmed. That's the best idea for a movie since . . . since . . . Girls Gone Wild! How could anything go wrong? Primarily, there's the script. It may have been written on the back on an envelope or a cocktail napkin. Or they may have taken it from one of those dreadful 99¢ amateur Kindle novels. A movie consisting solely of scenes showing Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens . . . uhm . . . ""showing affection"" would've made me happy, but after the scenes of drug and alcohol use, the girls meet up with a local gangsta who wears gold prosthetics on his teeth. James Franco is deliberately made-up to irritate one's retinas.",2013

7,"The trailer to this film is rather misleading. It's the equivalent of advertising the whole of Disneyland with just clips of Space Mountain again and again. There's a lot more going on here than Ryan Gosling robbing banks and being a general badass in The Place Beyond The Pines. There are in fact at least three main characters all with their own story. And while the Ryan Gosling section is, a bit like Space Mountain at Disney, the best bit of the package he is only one part of a much bigger picture. ",2013
8,"What he have here is a story about fathers and their sons. In fact, three separate stories - each one leads into the next. A lesser movie would have just told one story, but ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is larger in scope and needs all three parts to tell the complete story. A life is not just about your life but those you affect and those you leave behind for years to come.",2013
10,"I am a fan of ""The Gos""(Ryan Gosling). I admit I even tried to emulate him in ""Drive"" and ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"". He is a great actor and he always seems to make great movies whether they are mainstream or independent. He has already received recognition with an Oscar nomination for ""Half Nelson"". I was excited to see what character he would bring to life next when I heard about this movie. I saw the running time of 140 minutes and saw the trailer. I wondered how they were gonna make a movie of Gosling and Cooper last that long without dragging. Then I found out that Gosling is only in the first third of the movie despite him being the face of the movie. At first I felt disappointed, but I got over it because I know that isn't a way to judge a movie. So I went in after hearing mostly praise for this gem of a film.",2013

10,"You might call Derek Cianfrance's tremendous new movie ""A Place Beyond the Pines"" a blue-collar epic or a tragedy in three acts; it's certainly a drama in three acts. It runs for two hours and twenty minutes and it covers a period of about 17 years and there are really only about four major characters. To talk at all about the films storyline would be to spoil what is really an extraordinary narrative where even the coincidences of the third act seem to me to have resonance of great drama and it is magnificently played by its four principal actors.",2013
10,The Place Beyond The Pines was a magnificent third feature from director Derek Cianfrance. The performances were outstanding and it was a great story. The three act structure was executed brilliantly and were all tied together in a very satisfying way.,2013
10,"The Place Beyond The Pines tells a unique, compelling story in a way that I have never seen before. This movie kept me interested from start to finish. It is far from traditional storytelling. The story is split into three sections all very different from each other. I enjoyed each section of the movie almost equally, but the first hour of the movie is definitely the strongest. The movie may be slow to some, but I was invested in the story from start to finish. This is the best I've seen Ryan Gosling and Bradley Cooper, no doubt. There are no bad performances but Cooper and Gosling's stand out the most. Dane Dehaan plays an important role and does a great job of it. Dehaan is definitely a rising star. The tone of this movie is incredible, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good drama. It is the best movie I have seen this year, and with the breakthrough performances throughout, this is a movie you're not going to want to miss.",2013

5,This review contains some plot details.,2013
5,"This movie has excellent cinematography and great camera work and famous actors. that is it. I wish i could talk to the director and just figure out what the hell he was thinking. The first story of Ryan gosling as the bank robber was excellent.(the first 45 minutes) the second story of Bradley Cooper exposing corruption within his police department was decent, the idea certainly had potential. And the last story of their two kids meeting had little potential but still could have been an alright movie. When all three are combined, it is nothing but irrelevant wasted potential. Ultimately this movie dies with Lives and Dies by Ryan Gosling. I walked out of the theater angry that i was so manipulated by a near perfect movie trailer. The idea of Ryan Gosling as a bank robber is now wasted and Bradley cooper as a good cop among bad cops is ruined. And for the record, there is no ""Place Beyond the Pines"" it has nothing at all to do with the movie, its just a good marketing title to manipulate people into wasting their money on this disappointment of a movie.",2013

8,"Derek Cianfrance well known for his riveting film Blue Valentine (2010)  is back at it again giving us a breathtaking look at the lasting  consequences of the decisions we make. The Place Beyond The Pines is an  enthralling crime thriller that stretches over generations - a  beautifully crafted familial drama.  Quite possibly the most ambitious film of the year The Place Beyond The  Pines is about Luke (Gosling), a stunt motorcycle rider performing at a  low-grade carnival. While the tattooed Gosling's carnival goes through  New York he runs into an old fling, Romina (Eva Mendes) and is shocked  to discover in his absence she gave birth to his child. Luke growing up  without a father feels obligated to provide for his son Jason so he  decides to move nearby and it doesn't take long before Luke needs more  money and resorts to robbing a bank with his crooked boss (Ben  Mendelsohn). As you can imagine things don't exactly go to plan once  Avery (Bradley Cooper), a young and upcoming police officer, is  assigned to the case. To much surprise of the audience, shortly after  being introduced to Avery Cianfrance switches its narrative focus to  him and his family; a very risky move however the execution of the  technique is flawless. The story - now centered on Avery  follows him  trying to expose corruption within the department and making a name for  himself. With his strong desire to essentially become his father Avery  becomes detached from his wife and son. The final act of the film takes  place 15 years later and focuses on two high school students Jason  (Dane DeHaan) and AJ (Emory Cohen)  Luke and Avery's kids.   Unfortunately the narrative switch isn't as charming as the first one  and the film loses energy it spent so long building. It's not a movie  breaking issue because it is just such a pleasure to watch DeHaan  (Lawless, Chronicle) on screen. Last year he became my favorite young  actor and clearly he's not slowing down. Gosling once again a  mysterious, talented young man who resorts to robbing people for money  (Does Drive ring a bell?) does as well as usual in his performance but  nothing out of the ordinary for him. He'll play this same character  until people get sick of it. Cooper is the shining star of the film  though. There is no person that is going to leave this film not  wondering where this actor was hiding for his early career. The Place  Beyond The Pines is a real game changer for him. The rest of the  supporting cast stand their ground making the film extremely enjoyable.  Derek's ability to bring such realism to his characters is seamlessly  met with a more mature visual style this time around making The Place  Beyond The Pines his finest achievement yet. The films stunning  cinematography was brought to us by Sean Bobbitt (Shame), his work is  just fascinating to watch; every shot handled with such precision. The  film is brilliant, breathtaking and above all innovative. With this  intensely layered drama of fathers and sons Cianfrance has secured a  position as one of the best. This really is storytelling at its finest.  8.5/10",2013
6,"The first section holds promise of a tense thriller as Ryan Gosling gets addicted to robbing banks and using his motorbike riding skills to escape at high speed until...... The second section focuses on Bradley Cooper's cop, hailed as a hero but who finds it a mixed blessing carrying both danger but also opportunities worth exploiting. Once the headline appears on screen 'Fifteen Years later', we are in the third section and it's here that the film completely falls apart. The story becomes melodramatic and utterly predictable; the coincidences and plot contrivances are just ridiculous.To make matters worse we are served up a load of cod-psychology about fathers and sons. If only the director had stuck to making a solid thriller without all the pretentious overtones, this would've been a really good movie.",2013
1,"The synopsis for this movie sounds so much more interesting than it actually is. There were no redeeming characters, no one was conflicted over anything, no one wanted to achieve anything in particular. There was no great passion, no inner turmoil, no big lesson to be learned, not much of anything at all. I'm not dense, and I do enjoy subtlety in a movie, but unfortunately this movie only hinted at possible conflicts that never actually made it to screen. ",2013
3,"After watching the trailers for this film I was super-excited to see it. The cast is brilliant, the director is brilliant, but unfortunately the storyline was poorer than I could even imagine. ",2013
5,"Eh, it started out well. Ryan Gosling played a stunt driver who finds out he has a 1 year old son with Eva Mendez and decides to quit and build a life with them but she already has a man. But for some reason Ryan Gosling gets into the picture anyway. Its unclear what Eva Mendes's character thinks about Gosling and nothing is shown about her new relationship. Gosling decides he needs money to provide for them and starts robbing a bunch of banks(even though they seem to be doing just fine). He does spend some time with his son but oversteps his boundaries and then assaults Eva Mendes's boyfriend/husband? She cuts him off and he goes back to bank robbing and is chased by Bradley Copper. Ryan Gosling dies during the chase and Bradley Cooper is racked with guilt. He is treated as a hero but feels conflicted because he also has a 1 year old son who he can't look into the eye do to guilt. The second act of the movie deals with police corruption and resolves itself in a way that undermines the feelings I had about Bradley Cooper's character. The third act is the worst. First of all, its set 15 years later and Ryan Gosling and Bradley Cooper's offspring meet and there are violent consequences. Both young men are lost and angry but there is no depth given to them. Eva Mendes is aged considerably but Bradley Copper is not. Eva Mendes' son does not look part Latino at all or anything like Ryan Gosling. His character acts like hes from a different movie. His confrontations with Bradley Copper and his son make little to no sense. The characters lack motivation and are not consistent. In one scene both young men seem to be social outcasts in another one appears to be very popular. One one scene Bradley Copper's character appears to be moral the next scene he only cares about himself.",2013
4,"In an ambitious attempt of an epic familial drama-tragedy, Pines is presented in three acts that span over 15 years. A single event is meant to tie many characters and story lines together, while consistently presenting father-son relationships (and their lack there of). Act one introduces us to Handsome Luke (Gosling) a stunt motorbike rider in a traveling carnival. Quiet, tough, covered in tattoos, he is bored, but complacent. When he is reunited with an old fling, (Mendes) he learns he has an infant son. At this point, Luke makes some big changes in his lifestyle. Act one is the most rich in story, action and character. The ultimate challenge for Luke will be deciding what kind of father he's going to be, and that effort alone, good and bad, makes for a believable struggle. In act one we also have Robin (Mendlesohn) the mechanic, who is another quiet, complex character, driving much of the action and simultaneously trying to slow Luke down. The chase scenes feel raw and gritty, which makes them tense and right at home here. Act one, running just under an hour is a complete character arc in a well-told story and could have stood alone. Act two slows down as it introduces Avery Cross (Cooper) a rookie cop, newly claimed as a hero. His father-son issues are immediately presented as influencing his decision making. He has an infant son whom he struggles to connect with, while simultaneously trying to get free of his own father's controlling hand. The story in act two is not nearly as compelling. Avery is troubled and dealing with dirty cops and guilt from his title of ""hero"". He is a coward and uses the difficult situations he is dealing with to leverage him upwards in his career. There is little to no action or excitement in act two, it's mostly a cop drama which echoes many dirty cop dramas before it. Ray Liotta is wasted as the obvious ringleader of unsavory behavior. If we are supposed to compare the men from act one and two I would say they both made bad decisions, however, Luke's struggle was how to become the kind father he wanted to be, and Avery's is how to be the kind of man his father wants as a son. Other than the single event that links the two men together, act two is a totally separate film. 15 years pass and the third act begins with Avery's father's funeral. And in the longest half hour of my life we watch Avery's son AJ and Luke's son Jason collide towards each other like bulldozers. There is no mystery in this setup and no fireworks upon impact, save for a black eye. The parallels in their two very different lives are annoying. Both generally fatherless, recreational drug users and outsiders. Jason's journey is to find out more about his biological father. He uses Google to learn AJ's father was involved and Mendlesohn's character Robin returns to be a helpful friend from the past. AJ seems to have no journey or goals at all. My personal issues with act three are unavoidable. 1. Although we see these two characters heading straight for each other, nothing is interesting. Now we're watching an angsty teen drama without bullies or any girls. 2. They've clearly used makeup to age Mendes 15 years forward, and although it's shocking I allow myself to believe a mother working hard in a sort of broken life would look older. Cooper and Mendlesohn are not aged at all. 3. The ending of this confrontation is so anticlimactic, there is no character development in the third act at all, it feels like the movie ends with the last little bit of air going out of a balloon. My issues with the film as a whole: 1. The place beyond the pines is the Mohawk name for Schenectady, NY where this movie takes place, but there is no place beyond the pines. It is not mentioned or even eluded to at all. 2. The female roles in the film are seriously lacking. Understanding the film is trying to deal more with father-son relationships, Mendes' character felt the most real, although she is relatively weak (both emotionally and in moral character). She spends most of her scenes in tears. Rose Byrne is also totally wasted as Avery's wife. She has two scenes and in both she comes off as bossy and powerless simultaneously. Neither gives off the impression they are warm, loving mothers which may add greatly to the unhappiness of our two teenage sons, but it's clearly not the focus of the film, and so, as mothers, they are simply outlines. 3. The three acts are so different it could be like watching 3 episodes of a TV show filmed ten years apart. They vaguely resemble each other. ",2013
6,"The Place Beyond The Pines derives its title from the English translation of the Mohawk name for Schenectady, New York, where the film is set. Director Derek Cianfrance's third feature is the follow-up to 2010's widely praised Blue Valentine, a movie whose supposed magnificence was lost on me. Cianfrance reteams with one of that film's stars, Ryan Gosling, for one of The Place Beyond The Pines' three segments that unfolds over a 15 year period with interconnected story lines that mixes elements of crime drama, teenage angst, questions about fate, and the complexities of father-son relationships.",2012
1,"If there is a more cliché-ridden film of the last 20 years, I'm not sure I know what it is. This was predictable crap from beginning to end. You know what it really is? It's a stealth chick flick, and a horrible one at that... just like Cianfranco's last ""masterpiece,"" ""Blue Valentine."" That vapid piece of banality stretched my patience to the breaking point. ""Pines"" found that breaking point and chopped it up into tiny pieces. How dare he waste my time like that!!!",2013

10,"I intended to see The Place Beyond The Pines upon viewing the preview for the first time. The image of Ryan Gosling speeding into the tree lined horizon of upper New York was mesmerizing. I was curious to find out what he will bring to the character. Then, mixed reviews came in. Everyone praised Gosling's performance, he never disappoints, yet most found the three part vignettes disjointed and that the movie ran too long. With the film in limited release, I wondered if it was worth venturing out to Manhattan to see it. As my enthusiasm wavered and the film descended to the bottom of my to-see queue, I came across James Franco's review in the Huffington post. Franco's post about The Place Beyond The Pines is poignant, exhilarating and downright beautiful. He paints a vivid picture of Gosling (The Gos). He masterfully crafts each sentence in appraising the performance both individually and collectively. After reading the review, I too wanted to make love to the movie. Having availability this weekend, I decided to dedicate three hours to the appreciation of the Gos. With every scene, Franco's voice echoed in my head as if he was sitting right there whispering the film's narrative into my ear.",2013
1,"Where do I begin. The plot was all over the place. What started out as something promising, turn into a sloppy mess. I honestly wanted to leave after about 1 hr, basically after Ryan Gosling was killed. Only went to the movie to see him perform, as I like this acting capabilities. Have nothing against Bradley Cooper, but I did not see the movie to see him act. The movie was very misleading, as they new Ryan was the draw, and for him to be out more then half of the movie, was absolutely unacceptable to ANYONE who went to see him in this movie. ",2013
8,"Reading the other reviews, I'm amused by the number of reviewers who don't have a clue about how southern rural hill people behave (and esp. behaved back in the 1920s). They accuse Hardy, and to some extent LaBeouf, of bad acting because their characters are so laconic (that means they don't run off at the mouth a lot) and inward and don't wear every emotion on their sleeves. Then they mightily praise Oldman and Pearce for great acting when they were, in fact, just playing northern urban gangsters who like to behave over the top---the very thing that disgusts southern sensibilities.",2012

8,'Lawless' is definitely a great film but there's something missing. ,2012
1,Most definitely the worst gangster movie since the terminally boring Road To Perdition. Shia LaBoeuf concretes his position as the worst actor of his generation. Hardy nails it as the most over rated mumbling and grunting from start to finish. Oldman pops up for a cameo to show the pretenders how its done.,2013

9,"This movie is based on a book written by a relative of some of the main characters depicted in this movie...just looked up Wikipedia, and the author was Matt Bondurant, whose grandfather, Jack Bondurant, is called ""the runt of the litter"" of the Bondurant brothers featured in this tale of moonshiners in the age of Prohibition in America. That book was called ""The wettest county in the world"" and the title refers to how much illegal alcohol was produced in that area. The novel was adapted for cinema by Australian alternative rock icon Nick Cave.",2012
3,"Wanting to be so many things, sometimes, leaves you with very little. ""Lawless"" is a blatant example of that. Everything feels so unauthentic no matter how much effort has been put into accomplishing the opposite. The script is rambling and sketchy as well as starchy and, at times, downright annoying. Tom Hardy is one of my favorites of late, but here, he seems to be impersonating someone. It felt like a self-conscious parody. And Shia LaBeouf? What's with this man? Why is he playing leads in films? He, I'm sure, must have acting coaches and he is, clearly, following instructions, but what about the truth? He acts up a storm but there is not a moment of truth, not one. Look at the moment when he's told his friend Cricket has been killed. I felt embarrassed for him. Jessica Chastain's character suffers a radical change in the middle of the story and I kept wondering, how? when? and more importantly, why? Gary Oldman is always a pleasure to watch and Mia Wasikowska is lovely and does the most with the little she was given. The lack of chemistry between her and LaBeouf is unavoidable. He is acting all the time. The only highlight, really, is Guy Pearce. His performance is fearless and enormously entertaining.",2012

1,"Im sorry but if you consider this film to have been 'good' or 'enjoyable' then you probably should consider not writing reviews on film. The film was truly awful, it was incredibly dull and had an incredibly cheap feel to it. At times I heard myself groaning at just how bad certain scenes were and almost laughed when the two males that Tom Hardy dispatched with a knuckle duster, one whose throat was crushed, the other knocked out cold miraculously were able to get up, grinning and unharmed and then proceed to cut Hardys characters throat?? As for Gary Oldmans role in the film Im at a loss? Friend of the director possibly? Guy Pearces character was so outlandish and out of place in the film that it was embarrassing to watch. The final shoot-out scene was really the last straw for me, Hardys character having just been shot in the shoulder reloads his pistol and walks menacingly towards Pearce, teeth gritted, pistol aimed straight at Pearce and yet miraculously Pearce manages to draw his own gun and shoot Hardy god knows how many times without Hardy getting a shot off? None of it seems believable to the viewer, its as if the director thought he would get a great cast and then see if he could make a film around them? Anyway the jokes on me as I paid to watch this rubbish..gutted.",2013
7,"I'll be blunt, I came into this film with low expectations. Shia LeBouf was never my favorite actor, apart from when he played Stanley Yelnats in Holes (even if he was badly mis-cast). I was getting ready to hear him yell things towards something past the audience and watch him force himself to cry, which is one of the ugliest things I have ever seen. Apart from my low expectations, I kept an open mind and, let me say, I was pleasantly surprised.",2012

6,"I really like The Proposition so this reteam of Hillcoat and writer Nick Cave, who since he composed the greatest score in cinematic history in The Assassination of Jesse James can do no wrong in my eyes, was very promising, especially with a set piece and era that we haven't seen in a long while. Unfortunately, Lawless is tedious through and through. It's sequences go from bursts of heartless violence to development-less talking. The problem is its atmosphere, which could also be attributed to the choice of digital photography. It tries to be gritty, with its music hinting back to one of my favourite western TV shows, Deadwood, but the slick cinematography is just completely lifeless. It just feels like nobody's heart was truly in it (besides Guy Peace's menacing villain) with no chemistry between anyone. It was a huge mistake to try and force some romance subplots in here. There's nothing too bad about Lawless, besides its humourless and cold approach, it's just disappointingly average given the talent. ",2013
10,A lot of people are giving Lawless fairly negative reviews so I think I need to explain why it's such a great film. First of all it's really unique because of the specific setting of it during the prohibition in the United States which made it interesting viewing.,2013

A crooked law enforcement agent (Guy Pearce) tries to muscle in on the bootlegging activities in a Virginia hill town but some residents are not willing to let him take over. The war the follows is both thrilling and believable. It's also very scary because the movie makes you care about the characters - something that not many movies like this can achieve.",2012
7,"Good, but not great, and more than a little disappointing. Had heaps of potential: the (true) story was incredibly interesting. However, that may be the problem - there is too much to cram into a 2-hour movie. A mini-series may the more ideal medium. Certain events get glossed over. Some development of some of the more interesting sub-plots is required. Plus, we are lead down a few blind-alleys, plot-wise. The pacing is uneven too - better direction and editing was required. ",2015
7,"I like how the movie can balance between the quite contrast elements of the crime, both the single elements and the organized elements, and the romance ingredient. Based on a true story and having quite many big talent names, this movie can quite get the balance between the story and the scenario so that the stars can have enough duration to depict their significance in the story without being just a complementary cast. I like how the final conflict comes so fast without building up with time much time. I also like how the movie has quite a down played overall mood despite it's hard and violent tale. I like how Tom Hardy acted out his lead role here; he can really get the depiction of responsibility and determination on his brothers. Shia Lebouf depicts the kid brother nicely, showing off everywhere without really realizing the consequences. Jessica Chastain was bold enough to got total on her role here, and Mia Wasikowska and Gary Oldman gives just enough to breathe live to their respective characters.",2014
6,Lawless is an odd film.,2013

If you can appreciate the nuance, you can appreciate the performances delivered by the superb cast. Indeed the producers and or directors as well as those responsible for casting the likes of Tom Hardy, Guy Pierce, Gary Oldman, Shia LaBeouf, Jason Clarke, Jessica Chastain and Mia Wasikoska must be commended for their choice. The filmographies of Pierce, Hardy, Oldman, LaBeouf and Wasikoska made this a film I would not have missed, one I awaited with as much anticipation as the next Bond flick, but not for the same reasons. These five consummate professionals were impeccable in depicting characters of Matt Bondurant's novel.",2012
2,"How infuriating! Shia La Beouf? Really? Are we out of great actors? Are we scrapping the bottom of the barrel? A ""pretense"" film with an amateurish central performance by the aforementioned Mr. LaBeouf. What makes it worse, he is surrounded by people of the caliber of Gary Oldman and Guy Pearce. Tom Hardy, a sensational actor by all accounts, here he's kind of ridiculous. Walter Brennan with great lips. The story is told by someone who doesn't have a clue about dramatic structure and the photography goes from pastel to total darkness and I saw it at the Los Angeles Cinerama Dome so I imagine there were no problems with the projection. I'm trying to understand the good reviews. There should be a law against the opportunistic casting and all the rest of this con-job.

The writing for this movie really stood out to me, as the conversations felt so real between characters because of subtle little things that happen in most conversations in real life.

8,"The First Time seems like a film that would be as redundant and as vacuous as the title it boasts, when in retrospect, it's a rather complete film. A very surprising one at that. It's talky, moving at a slowburn pace, which is a blessing, especially in this genre, open to showing human characters function in a strange world, and deep in its focus on two characters that do more than meet-cute - they stay cute. They also make it easy to like them since they're sincere and just as confused as we were as they quickly wander out of adolescence before they even felt like they were in.",2013
6,"Great coming of age teen movie that explores the angst of the 'First Time'. Unlike most teen flicks, the characters don't fall into stereotypes, and they act their age in an intelligent way that does not lean towards Dawson Creek territory. Great from start to finish, and different from most movies in that genre.The teens are normal, the girl and boy you and I know, and now some picture perfect model. The cast were excellent in their roles in fact I have also watched the lead character in Teen Wolf and this is quite a departure from the role he plays in that. The best thing, however, about the movie is the romance was relate-able and normal, and not some unrealistic love story you only seen in movies. What a great ending!",2013
8,"I go back quite aways to A Summer Place and Parish,yet even as a senior citizen I found The First Time to be a refreshingly honest and well acted film highlighted by the performance of Britt Robertson, a young actress who unfortunately is in the shade of Jennifer Lawrence and Ellen Page...yet I hope she can find he way into the sun because she has a lot to offer.",2013
10,"This is my first review and after watching 'The First Time' I thought I would write this ..'Aubrey (britt Robertson) meets Dave (Dylan O'Brien)after a house party in an alley way they immediately hit it off and even though Aubrey is in a relationship with a guy who doesn't understand her she begins to fall for Dave . The acting is this is really astonishing the chemistry between the two main characters is second to none , feels so real . Britt Robertson is so sexy and funny too , amazing actress. Dylan O'Brien is super talented in this funny romantic comedy. Wish there were more movies as good as this and as well acted.",2013
7,"Here's me, thinking I'd have to go through this horrible movie just to see Victoria Justice in it but I was totally wrong. It was quite the opposite actually, I had to go through Victoria Justice so I can watch these interesting characters fall in love.",2013
10,It has been a long time since I watched such an awesome teen movie. I always want to find a movie which can represent our feeling when it comes to first love. And this movie is the ONE! ,2013
10,"I thought this movie handled teenage romance, chemistry, nervousness, perhaps actual first time sex, really well. If it's truly the first time for both kids..it can be weird and confusing. I especially enjoyed the music and can't find a soundtrack. :( I thought the characters were original. The conversation between the 3 guys was not untypical of what I had with my buddies back in the day...long ago. The one scene where the guy yells back at them ""what's wrong with you assholes..."" wasn't really a necessary scene. It appeared the director just forgot to drop that on the floor. However, it would have been nice to have seen a little more interaction between Dave and Aubrey..like the theories he talked about and the discussions he was referring to. Still I'm 52 and I watched it with my teenagers and we all loved it.",2013
10,I really have so many to wrap up this film with such a great words. At the beginning I want to mention I am 16 year old boy and I definitely will watch it second time or even more.,2013
5,"Personally I felt this film was mediocre. It could've been a good film but what got me the most was the pacing. The whole meeting/breaking up with boyfriend happened within such a short space of time and even them getting together was in such a short space of time. I also found the characters exasperating and unrealistic. Usually I feel that Britt Robertson is a good actress but in this I feel she was appalling and so was Dylan O'Brien. The likeliness that a girl like Aubrey would ever end up with Ronnie. Victoria Justice annoyed me and the way that the teenagers talked about parties and how you'd just waltz into a party was so so so unrealistic. Who actually just drives around looking for parties to go to? It doesn't happen. The script was weak and just not relate-able. The scene near the end where she says to her parents: 'I met a boy' was especially irritating as no one actually does that.The way in which the two main leads interacted was infuriating and overall I would not recommend this film. It was cliché. However, the one redeeming feature was the soundtrack. It was easy listening and suited the scenes. Also, I quite liked Craig Robertson's character who introduced a comedic element.",2014
6,"This was a passably interesting take on the high school movie. The characters felt real and had at least some depth, other than Dave's friends who felt shoehorned in for non-existent comedy. I thought the 'token black guy' was the thing of the past, but here he is again in a mostly silent, vaguely racist role as the friend and straight talking foil of the sensitive dreamy white kid. The 'English' friend was very awkward too, the accent was way off and the actor wooden.",2014

10,"This movie hearkens back to early John Hughes, back when Molly Ringwald was his muse. The dialogue shows that Jon Kasdan was paying attention when his dad was penning those excellent screenplays for Grand Canyon, The Big Chill and others. The direction is subtle, and the performances pitch perfect. Watching Dave and Aubrey fall quietly and quickly in love was both beautiful and amusing. Their obvious attraction to each other, or at least mutual interest is played out without fanfare in a wonderfully organic way. It was interesting to see Victoria Justice, obviously the ""big"" name in the cast play against type in her small but pivotal role. Kudos also to the part of Big Corporation. His character, while once again small, is essential. His physical presence, and the fact that he is silent in his first couple of scenes, makes his advice to Dave near the end all the more surprising. For me, he is one the lynch pins for the movie. Now as to Aubrey and Dave. WOW! Watching the actors inhabit these characters and avoid the clichés and stereotypes that could have easily have made this just another sex farce was wonderful to behold. I also admit that Dave reminds me of myself 40 years ago. A good guy, possibly carrying the torch for the wrong girl but being so obviously sweet and caring that Aubrey was able to see it, even without wanting to. Spoiler: the seduction scene is wonderfully poignant and funny and, most importantly, true to life. The truth is, rarely is the first time smooth going, much less rapturous. All in all, a very good movie that I would recommend to anyone, especially teens as they approach that fantastic and torturous time of their lives called high school.",2014
8,"First of all i wanna tell you that i liked this movie very much,i was caught by the beginning of it , there was a lot of intrigue ,it shows us the real teen's problems in a different way not like the other teen movies which are all similar . this movie had also the other awkward side between new couples and the issues that we don't want to talk about much .",2014

As he practices a speech to let her know how much he likes her in an alley during a party he meets Aubrey (Britt Robertson). Dave and her start to talk and get to know each other on a walk home. This sparks a relationship that begins during this first weekend for their meeting. The only thing is that Dave still has feelings for Jane and Aubrey currently has a boyfriend. Throughout the weekend they both go back and forth with each other trying to figure out their feelings. As well as when their ""first time"" will be and with who.",2013
8,I was very impressed by Britt in this film. The storyline is typical but the truthfulness that the characters bring is why this movie is so good. Teenage sex for the first time is a big deal and that is explored throughout the movie. Also the realization that sex is not such a big deal is also explored very true to life. Aubrey is so willing to loose her virginity to a typical jerk because she knows that sex is not going to be good at this point anyway. Dave thinks it should be special and mean something. The relationship between teenager and parents is briefly shown and rather funny. The chemistry between Aubrey and Dave is unmistakable and i really enjoyed watching them together.,2013
9,"Lets move quickly over the fact that Jon Kasdan is the son of Lawrence Kasdan, top-tier Hollywood film royalty with a list of credits that any film geek could recite even if in a coma. So for his ""first"" film (see the pun in the title?) we have high expectations. This story of young love, while a little uneven, is unforgettable, mainly as a result of the chemistry between the actors. There is no substitution for chemistry. An excellent script by Jon (whose father first attracted attention mainly as a writer) helps, but at the end of the reel its the performances that matter. Britt Robertson has a strong future ahead, she pulls a page from the Rachel McAdams handbook, and actually seems to glow in some shots. The film works, and works brilliantly, whenever the two leads are in frame. Trivia: Kasdan changes Robertson's makeup after the ""event"" in the film to emphasize the change. It's a cheesy trick but with an actor like Robertson to work it, he pulls it off anyway.",2013
9,"I just loved that movie, because the story, the actors and also the music is just awesome. If you see the first 20 minutes of the movie where the two main actors talk together you are hypnotized of the great play of them. Britt Robertson and Dylan O'Brien give the movie an art of soul,which grew up during the 92 minutes of watching. At the end of the film you wish there will be more, but there is just a great ending. Furthermore the next cast is convincing down the line. I just say or better write BIG Corportion with his useful tips. Finally there is one more fact which you have to know, the director and writer John Kasdan and son of Lawrence Kasdan shows in this movie that he has also the talent like his father. If you had a bad day you have to see this movie and you feel much better...",2013
7,"I really enjoyed this film. Even the opening credits, i found interesting (although there's no getting away from the American high school party cliché). The leads are pretty good- i found Dylan O'Bien's character more well rounded and less... well. Those kooky dream girl clichés exist for a reason and you were pushing the line pretty hard, here. The script wasn't bad. A little heavy handed at times, but we move along fast enough that you don't get too bogged down into it. There were some genuinely emotional moments, a few laugh out loud moments, and a refreshing approach to teen sex and relationships.",2013

7,"1/15/18. A great teen romance movie that captures the angst of first love. Even more alluring is the couple, O'Brien and Robertson, had the chemistry to make their initial attempt to be the first for each other believable. A teen flick with a lot of heart that is worth catching.",2018
3,"I began this film with the same amount of hope I have for any teenage romance comedy: not much. I was expecting a few witty quips, some tolerable acting, and a quietly unique take on an overused story. Apparently, this was too much to expect. While the story was fresh, the timeline was too fast, making the film too unrealistic to enjoy. The acting was, well, not good, and if I ever see another change my mind, stop in my tracks, and turn back around, I may vomit. The film is called 'The First Time', but the sex-talk was unrealistic and wasn't integrated into the film and its characters well enough, and the amount of time spent revolving around the topic of sex was not enough to warrant a title. Overall, it was too unrealistic to enjoy.",2017
8,THE IMPOSSIBLE (2012) ,2012
10,"It would be impossible to try and capture the widespread loss and destruction of this horrible, devastating event. The scope was so large and far too many people lost their lives to even attempt to portray on film. Instead, director Juan Antonio Bayona and screenwriter Sergio G. Sánchez focused smartly on the true story of one family's struggle for survival amongst all that had happened on December 26th, 2004. ",2013
9,"At first I did not think this movie was something I would like to see. I felt it would be one of those movies that once the disaster happened it would become dis-interesting and would be boring the second half of the movie. I am very happy I had the opportunity to see it. The only reason I did not give it a 10 was I thought the character build up was a little shallow. I would have liked to get know the family a little better before the disaster. Other than that I feel that the movie was fantastic. Once the inevitable happened the film kept my interest and was very compelling throughout. The special effects were realistic and not over done. I wish foreign movies like this would make a bigger release in the United States to show Hollywood how to make a movie especially a true story movie. I felt when I was watching this film that I was seeing it actually happening with no to very little exaggerations. That is where I feel Hollywood falls short and puts allot of drama in a film that really did not occur in the true event. If there were exaggerations in this movie they were seamless and not over done. If you have a chance to see this movie I feel it is ""a must see movie"" you will not be disappointed.",2012

8,"A film that captures real life the way J.A. Bayona captures it in his newest film The Impossible is a rare occurrence in filmmaking. Not only does he pay respect to the countless victims that were lost in the devastating tragedy, he makes artistic choices and liberties only the most seasoned directors can take. Starring Academy Award Nominee Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor, the film tells the TRUE story about a family vacationing in Thailand when one of the worst natural disasters of our time separates them.",2012
7,"Disaster films have an odd reputation, often merely dismissed as popcorn fodder, so it's strange to have a film billed as such but to put character and drama over spectacle. Then again, as it's based on a true story, it's probably unfair to label 'The Impossible' as such a movie because the plight of the characters is at its heart throughout the entire duration. Perhaps this film is best described as a family drama with elements of disaster, then.",2013
7,"Amazing effects and stunts, along with and solid performances balance out some artistic lapses and ethical questions in this true story of one family's experiences of the horrendous Tsunami that killed 300,000. ",2012
7,"I watched The Impossible with a clear intention to remain a little emotionally detached. I knew from the trailer that a disaster was imminent from the word go, so I braced myself for impact and kept my fingers crossed that Ewan Mcgregor was going to give more than the lack luster performance that i feel like I've been growing accustomed to. Okay, so i was crying from about 10 minutes into the film. While McGregor is credible, although still not a return to form, the real performance here is from Naomi Watts. She is gripping to watch, and lends credibility to the rest of the cast as she watches the world fall apart around her. I winced, squirmed and spent many minutes forgetting to breathe. An emotional roller-coaster which, while somewhat lacking in depth in storyline, more than makes up for it with a strong edit. Great job with an average script.",2013
9,"The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami is brought to shockingly realistic life in J. A. Bayona's ten minute sequence near the beginning of the harrowing true-life survival tale, ""The Impossible."" With little to no CGI and using mostly scale models and a giant water tank, Bayona throws the viewers into the wave along with stars Naomi Watts (astonishing) and young Tom Holland (revelatory as Watts' son). Told from the point of view of a family on holiday in Thailand, the story makes for a riveting family-centered emotional drama. The rest of the cast is outstanding as well, and there's a strong humanist approach applied to depicting this wide-spread multi-national disaster.",2012
8,"Another of the many World Premieres showcasing at the Toronto  International Film Festival with hopes of Oscar glory is, The  Impossible, the true story of a family's struggle to reunite after  being violently separated when the tsunami hit the beach of sun soaked  Thailand in 2004.  The film stars Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts as the two parents of  three young boys that were vacationing in Thailand over Christmas when  the tsunami devastated the country and shocked the world.  With a prerequisite set-up of the main characters, the tsunami hits  early in The Impossible and packs an incredible punch. As the wave  crashes through the hotels pool area and sweeps away the five members  of the family, we watch in terror as Maria (Watts) and Lucas (Tom  Holland) struggle to stay above the raging water and within arms  lengths of each other.  Once the water settles, the badly injured Maria and Lucas begin a  journey of survival without knowledge as to the fate of the missing  three members of the family. Lucas is forced to mature beyond his years  and assist in getting his mother to a hospital for immediate emergency  attention and is the key to the more emotional scenes that conclude the  film.  The Impossible is only the second film made using new 3-D sound  technology (the film is in 2-D) and the crashing and fast flowing water  sequences can be heard, and almost felt, throughout the entire theatre.  When not fully engrossed in our characters' plights and emotionally  tied to their survival, we are thoroughly repulsed by the graphic  scenes of bodily destruction that blood soak the screen. Director J.A.  Bayona is no stranger to horrific make-up effects as he was the genius  behind the camera for The Orphanage (2007) and he pulls no punches  here. Some audience members were seen turning their heads unable to  ingest the graphic nature of effects and few were even seen exiting  while the scenes played out in long detail.  Thanks to the trailers, we know (generally) how the movie concludes.  But just like Ron Howard's masterful Apollo 13, J.A. Bayona still keeps  us at the edge of our seats even with an ending that is both clear and  true to the original story.  The Impossible does have its shot at some Awards glory. Watts and  McGregor pull off incredibly emotional and physical scenes and films  that deal with real life tragedy and the human spirit that overcomes  those tragedies usually find favour with award voters.  But whether or not The Impossible gets any gold plated hardware it does  not take away from the tiring and emotional journey that audiences will  take with their characters. The Impossible is the best depiction yet of  the Indian Ocean tsunami and the horrors that succeeded it. It is also  one of the best movies we have seen so far this year. Packed with equal  scenes of tearful drama and graphic horrors. And although the wave is  the catalyst that propels the plot, the characters are so strong that  the big wave that hits the resort will hardly be the thing you most  remember.",2012

6,"This telling about the 2004 tsunami that killed in excess of 250,000 people hit both critical acclaim and controversy when it was released . Naomi Watts was Oscar nominated as best actress but there were some outcries that the characters had been changed from Spanairds to Anglo-Saxons for no good reason . This wasn't a case of arrogant Hollywood changing characters in order to bring audience identification to a true life story because THE IMPOSSIBLE is in fact a Spanish film with a Spanish production team and one wonders why the producers couldn't have put some native Spanairds in front of the camera ? Would the film have suffered if we had Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz playing Henry and Maria ? There wouldn't have even needed to speak in their native tongues ",2013

Eventually, when the film ended I simply hated myself for glorifying such self-centered middle-class rubbish. Basically, this is the story a rich white family that lost their luggage and had to search for each other for a couple of days to then fly away in a private jet arranged by their insurance company. After the film I decided to document myself a little further, hoping to be wrong about the whole thing and watched, amongst other footage, an interview with the mother of the actual family. This only confirmed what I suspected. The part of the interview that did it for me is when the mother recalls the following: The film was shot during dry season and yet it was raining a lot and the director was getting restless because of this. The mother spoke to the director and told him that it was OK, that he did not have to worry, all that rain were the hundreds of thousand of tsunami victims crying. Since then I can't stop hating myself for feeding this egotistic rubbish.",2013
1,"This is my very first review on IMDb. Without doubt this site is the most reliable source for honest film reviews and in my opinion anything rated 7 or above is well worth watching. Until now that is. This film, currently rated a whopping 7.7 is in fact unbelievably bad. Like you would not believe. And right from the off. Wooden acting from McGregor and Watts is simply terrible, throughout. Either I must be missing something, give the startling reviews, or, more likely the reviews are based on sentiment given the tragic loss of life from recent tsunamis. The story line is also highly implausible. How is it that first class actors and a director with at least one excellent film to his name (Orphanage) can be happy with this production? Given the basis of the story it can't not be nominated for any awards. But it ain't gonna win any, and thats for sure.",2013

OK, good for them, comes of living in the 1st world, having tons of disposable income, etc. But it makes for a boring movie, which it shouldn't have been since it's based on real events. I kept waiting to FEEL something, at least something other than wow! at the special effects. A much more interesting focus would be to delve into the lives of some of the local populace, the ones not-so-rich, not-so-white, no-so-insured. The ones, say, who lost homes, families, communities, livelihoods, health, virtually EVERYTHING that matters, and somehow neglected to have some Zurich-based insurance company covering all misfortunes. That scenario happened too, for real - and in numbers vastly surpassing the Tourist Trauma that is all this pricey film appears to care about.

10,"""The Hunt"" is the latest unflinching drama from Danish auteur Thomas Vinterberg. Co-written with Tobias Lindholm, this is an ambitious star vehicle for legendary actor Mads Mikkelsen, an icon in Denmark and familiar face around the world as well.

At its heart the story is ultimately a powerful comment on prejudice, based on true incidents, that may leave you emotionally drained but truly moved.",2012

Yes, it's a common tale that has been told in cinema before(man is wrongly accused and ostracised), but never so well, in my eyes. The acting is first class with no exception and the cinematography is perfect, creating a tense mood throughout the film. It's not for the faint hearted, but I think it's an important subject matter and very current. I've often wondered what it must be like for someone wrongly accused of such a crime and the hysteria that surrounds it. I have read reviews that say this is unrealistic but I don't agree, I only have to look on my own front doorstep in England to see exactly the same sort of behaviour, often far far more intense.",2012
10,"Sometimes children lie.  Sometimes good people give in to hysteria, and lose all sense of  reason.  Sometimes they destroy innocent lives.  The Hunt (aka Jagten) is the latest offering from Denmark that will  knock you sideways. Forget the thrill of TV dramas The Killing, Borgen  and The Bridge, Thomas Vinterberg's film is a shocking, harrowing  experience that will affect you profoundly and will live in your mind  for a very long time. The Hunt is for those who don't need to 'enjoy' a  film to regard it as valid and who are not afraid to step into the  darkness of the injustice and judgment of which we are all capable.  More than that, it is a film for those who stupidly believe there is no  smoke without fire.  Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen) is a lonely teacher, divorced from his wife,  kept apart from his son and devoted to the young children in his care  at the nursery and within the community. He is a genuinely good man who  has earned the respect of his peers, the love of a new girlfriend and  the trust of the children who leap out of hedges to wrestle him and be  chased around the playground by him.  Klara (Annika Wedderkopp), the daughter of his best friend, Theo  (Thomas Bo Larsen) has an innocent, childish crush on Lucas when two  situations occur in quick succession. Firstly she is exposed to an  explicit pornographic image and, secondly, Lucas gently chastises her  for inappropriate behavior towards him. With a fertile imagination,  childish indignation and no comprehension of the consequences, Klara  makes an accusation against Lucas and his world implodes.  For only the fifth time so far this year, I believe I have witnessed a  near-perfect film. The Hunt is complete due to the tight screenplay,  the sensitivity of Vinterberg's direction and the performances from  principal and peripheral actors alike that are always absorbing and  frequently astounding.  Mikkelsen must certainly be the focal point of any review. His  performance as Lucas causes the stomach to tighten and the back tingle  as we wonder How would I react? In much the same way that Colin Firth's  George crumpled when receiving the news of his partner's death in A  Single Man, so Mikkelsen's Lucas is silently crushed as he is told that  accusations have been made. Lucas suffers the physical and emotional  wounds of slander and revenge for an act he cannot conceive and of  which he has less knowledge than those who condemn and attack him.  Equally, both Larsen and Anne Louise Hassing as Klara's parents  carefully unwrap the turmoil any parent would suffer upon hearing their  young child has suffered sexual abuse. It is a challenge not to yell at  the screen ""Don't be so stupid,"" or to scream expletives at Grethe  (Susse Wold) the head teacher who loses her grip on both duty and  reason and germinates the hatred and judgment that follow. As Lucas'  son, Marcus, Lasse Fogelstrøm gives a heartfelt performance segueing  seamlessly from courage to hurt to desperation and anger and his  distress is a warning to those given over to rumours.  The surprise, no, the absolute shock, with the casting is Wedderkopp.  In an adult with twenty years experience on the big screen it would be  a breathtaking performance; that this is the debut of a young child is  staggering. She is entirely believable as the girl with the vivid  imagination and understandable lack of foresight who is lead by  over-enthusiastic adults and suffers her own punishment of confusion  alone.  The tragedy within The Hunt is explicit and unavoidable. The external  tragedy is that it will probably not feature on most To See lists  because it is both foreign and that the explosions are emotional rather  than physical. Although it is Denmark's entry for Best Film in a  Foreign Language for the Oscars, I suspect both Mikkelsen and Vinterbeg  will be completely overlooked in their own right as with the principals  of Beasts of the Southern Wild. Thank goodness for the BAFTAS and Mark  Kermode! The events depicted in The Hunt are utterly horrific. Don't  sit in front of the screen expecting a light, easy, thought provoking  flick. I emerged numb, angry, helpless and terrified. But for one  careless or cruel comment, it could happen to me.  Or you.",2012
9,"I saw this movie yesterday. I agree with previous reviewers, this is an excellent, moving, wonderfully acted movie. It is impossible I think to go through it without being brought to tears at one point or another. You also feel like screaming at some characters sometimes - ""what are you doing? Open your eyes! Listen!"" But the great thing is you always understand where each character is coming from- you might not agree with their actions, but nothing they do feels forced or unrealistic. Mikkelsen is amazing in this. I had seen him in a few movies before, and always thought highly of him, but here he is just incredible. It's a tough subject matter, and the movie does not shy away from it, but at the same time it is not vulgar or ""in your face"", it's tactful. I really loved it.",2012

9,"I just saw The Hunt at the New Zealand International Film Festival and I walked out speechless. The Hunt has such a difficult story to tell but the film makers never go too far with little exposition. The film doesn't take one side over another, making the point that there isn't really any ""bad guys"" in the film, just people on opposite sides of one coin. The script is shocking, tragic and at times funny. The film is very intimately shot with an almost documentary approach. The film is mostly shot hand-held, giving you the feeling of realism. The camera likes to get in close and hold on the actors eyes and it is the eyes that tell the story. Most of the story is told through what was not being said, but instead with looks and pauses. Mads Mikkelsen is stunning as always as the man accused of sexual abuse. He plays the role with such sensitivity to the character but always keeps you guessing throughout the film. Annika Wedderkopp plays the role of the innocent young girl to perfection, again always keeping you guessing. Their relationship being one of the most interesting I've seen on film this year. If I had one complaint it would be that the main plot ends quite abruptly, not leaving me fully satisfied before it goes into the epilogue. The Hunt is drama at its best with beautiful performances from the entire cast. It is hard to explain how great this film is without giving away spoilers but the film gives no clear answers for such a difficult subject and it makes you ask yourself, what would I do?",2012
9,"Here in the small town where I reside, our local newspaper had a recent headline that a beloved teacher was suspected of improper contact with a student. The article was complete along with his picture and I felt that this teacher's life was over as he knew it whether the information was accurate or false. I felt that I would withhold judgement pending an accurate and a detailed investigation, but I know that others would not give the teacher this courtesy. Human nature is an interesting thing to observe and we often get trapped in our own snares with comments such as ""I really can't tolerate judgemental people"".",2013
10,"Whenever I watch a great film, I always have a sense of feeling cleansed, as if a soiled part of me has been washed away (for the time being anyway) by something on the screen that touches a better part of my soul. THE HUNT certainly did that for me. The story is a simple one, a man, a teacher, is wrongly accused of sexually misconduct with a young child and his community, filled with old friends and acquaintances, turn on him and make his life a living hell.",2013
8,"Just like he did 14 years ago in Festen, Thomas Vinterberg once again shows us how a closely-knit community reacts to a shocking revelation. In Festen, a family party was spoiled by the revelation of a secret scandal. In Jagten, a group of friends and neighbours turn hostile when one of them is falsely accused of sexually abusing a young child, the daughter of his best friend. ",2012

9,"According to English Professor Jack Lynch, ""Lies, once they are accepted as true, take on a life of their own, one that lasts long after the original falsehoods have been exposed."" The power of the continued acceptance of lies is reflected in Thomas Vinterberg's The Hunt, the disturbing story of the false accusation of a kindergarten teacher of sexual abuse. It is an accusation that reveals the sordid underbelly of a small town, hidden beneath the veneer of middle-class civility. Written by Vinterberg and Tobias Lindholm, The Hunt is a thought-provoking drama that makes us aware both of the vigilance needed to protect our children from predators, and of the crucial importance of following the precept that an individual is innocent until proved guilty in a court of law.",2012
8,"Danish screenwriter and director Thomas Vinterberg's eight feature film which he co-wrote with Danish screenwriter and director Tobias Lindholm and co-produced, premiered In competition at the 65th Cannes International Film Festival in 2012, was screened in the Special Presentations section at the 37th Toronto International Film Festival in 2012 and is a Danish production which was shot on location in Denmark and produced by Danish producer and screenwriter Morten Kaufmann and Danish producer Sisse Graum Jørgensen. It tells the story about Lucas, a recently divorced middle-aged man who just began working at a kindergarten and who wishes to spend more time with his teenage son Marcus who lives with his mother. After starting a romance with a foreign woman named Nadja things improve, but one day during a conversation with Grethe who runs the day-care center, he learns that a girl named Klara has told her an unsettling story about him. In a matter of days a spark is turned into a flame and a harmonic village into an irrational witch-hunt against one individual. ",2012

10,"A Little History - I have a wide range of actors that I love. Most of the time, I like to backtrack through a couple of their previous films when I like them a lot, and then I just get on with it. Not the case here. I decided to start watching Hannibal about 6 months after it aired and I got my first good look at a spectacular Danish actor named Mads Mikkelsen. He is extremely talented but, judging by the fact that I love horror films, have seen Silence Of The Lambs numerous times, and figured the television show could never match the talents of the wonderful Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster, I wrote it off. Until about three episodes in when this God of Danish cinema showed off his talents. After the show, and because I adore foreign cinema, I decided to binge on every single one of his movies. That my friends, is how I came across The Hunt.",2013
3,"I hate to give this a bad review as I am a big fan of Mads BUT there are so many ridiculous parts to this story I can not believe how people have rated it. As a teacher, firstly the whole premise of this film is that 'kids never lie' well I'm sorry but any teacher who's been in the job more than a day knows that kids lie all the time. Secondly the other kids would not just make stories up about being abused - and collaborate on a story; especially at a nursery.",2013

10,"The thing about Thomas Vinterberg's The Hunt that you should know is that there's no ""twist"" or big revelation. There's no real ambiguity about whether or not Lucas touched or 'showed' himself to little Klara, the daughter of Lucas' best friend. If there were, this might be a very different movie - perhaps even one that leaned on being dishonest with the audience about the 'did he or didn't he' intentions. It's clear enough early on that Klara isn't telling the whole truth when she mentions to one of the other Kindergarten workers about the ""rod"" that stands up (meaning the penis), but it doesn't mean she's exactly lying either, just confused in that way that little kids who don't know anything about sex might be if, say, shown a very brief image of a ""rod"". So there's that. But what The Hunt is really about is perception and how quickly people can turn on someone with a target on them - guilt or no guilt, but especially in the case of not guilty - like with Lucas.",2015

""The Hunt"" is a highly sensitive matter and it is delivered very subtle. Can't be better. The story is well written, the direction is refined. The acting is superb. Mads Mikkelsen is the king. On of the best actors alive... And when this movie ends, it will leave you in silence. Speechless. A unique movie experience that will - HUNT you! For a long, long time...",2013

3,"I saw trailers for this in the cinema and considered going to see it.  Thankfully I didn't waste £8 paying for a ticket. The premise for this  seemed great- OK reminiscent of True Lies- but there seemed to be  potential for comedy and drama. Potential that is sadly never realised.  Tom Hardy and Chris Pine are both charming leads (Pine needs to stop  doing that chewing with his mouth open thing)Reese Witherspoon is possibly a little old for this kind of  role- or at least this kind of role with Hardy and Pine- but she plays  the role well enough.  The problem is that there is no plot to speak of, very little action  and precious few laughs. The film is beautifully lit but the editing is  horrible. It reminds the viewer of Quantum of Solace with its action  sequences that could be memorable except the viewer can't see what is  happening. It doesn't look a cheap film and the cast and premise could  have made for something memorable but how could the end result be so  unsatisfying. Vapid, bland, predictable and empty its like overdosing  on cake icing because there is no cake underneath.  All the way through I couldn't help wonder how so much could have gone  wrong until as the end credits rolled I saw it was directed by McG .  Nothing more to be said.",2012
4,"If you wanted to make a movie that was successful at the box office, you could plug the story lines of the top 25 movies for the last 10 years into a computer and have it generate a plot. It would probably come up with a new genre called the 'romantic action comedy'. It would probably come up with, 'This Means War'. I spent most of the movie trying to figure out who it was targeted for. First, no adult with a few functioning neurons will find the plot compelling. I doubt if women would find the romance unforgettable. I, therefore, concluded that the movie was targeted towards 15 year old boys out on their first dates. Yes, there are the obligatory action scenes with the required number of explosions and car chases, but this is mainly to wake up the 13-year-olds who fell asleep during the 'romantic' scenes. The comedy, and I am stretching the dictionary definition of that word here, comes mainly from the sexual remarks of Chelsea Handler and are directed at the same sleepy 13-year-olds.",2012

Well, while I am not a paid critic or film reviewer, I will have to say that I pretty much hated this movie. I thought the whole concept of two CIA agents abusing their privileges to stalk a girl that they both liked was ridiculous, and the fact that they actually get away with it borders on the really concerning.",2012
1,Just a quick example to summarise my impressions of this awful nonsense.,2012
1,"This is a god awful concoction of s*** stew. Lauren (Witherspoon) is presented as a 30 something frumpy, self conscious idiot who's introduction is spent lying about her life to an ex she runs into and sighing over her loneliness. After her friend hooks her up with an online dating profile, she sees Tuck's (Hardy) picture, and decides she is going to give it a shot. She meets Tuck, they immediately engage in back and forth watered down humour and then suddenly, due to poor editing, the date ends without any sign of how long it was. She then goes to rent a DVD.. (who does that in 2012?) where she meets FDR (Pine), who tries to obnoxiously hit on her. In the span of a few hours, she is hit on by both Hardy and Pine, and develops wit and confidence, and actually shoots one of them down. This is coming from a chick who hasn't been able to talk to men in years. All it took was for her to experience a wardrobe change, and miraculously we never see awkward, frumpy Lauren again. Instead, enters the sexy irresistible Lauren we always knew was under that frump! The rest of the movie, we see Pine and Hardy competing for her affection and the ultimate answer: which man does she fall in love with?!",2012
4,"I'm a fan Reese Witherspoon and Tom Hardy's been making some good performances lately, but this is one movie that they should just write off as poor judgement. And I'm really sorry to say this, because it was a good idea and I certainly hope that someone, sometime in the future will take the idea and make a good movie out of it.",2012
4,"McG hasn't really been seen in the director's chair since Terminator Salvation hit theaters back in 2009. Audiences were split as to whether they actually enjoyed Salvation or not as critics hated it and the movie failed to make back its budget in its domestic gross. So what's the logical next step after doing a movie about the nuclear holocaust and the ongoing war between humans and humanoid machines? You could probably guess the action bit, but the romantic comedy part would probably throw you off.",2012
4,"Director McG has many (many, many) haters, but I generally like his movies. I don't consider him a ""misunderstood genius"", nor anything similar; I just generally find his exuberant visual style and frantic energy entertaining. I found Charlie's Angels and its sequel amusing parodies of the action cinema; I liked Terminator Salvation for having found an interesting angle to the franchise; and We Are Marshall...well, that one was mediocre. Anyway, I can't defend McG with This Means War, his most recent film, because it ended up being truly horrible.",2012
2,"I should have gone by the User Rating of this movie. Usually I try not to watch anything that has a rating of less than a 7, but I have been surprised on occasion. I watched Funny People that had a rating of 6.5 & I thought I might try this one too. But while Funny People actually had a few laughs, this one left me bewildered.

5,"I went to go see this movie with two friends, Im a big fan of Tom Hardy and have seen all of his movies and other stuff. I... kinda liked the movie... it was kinda bad but I kinda liked it. Lets get a few things out the way. Editing was horrible, the entire opening looked like a trailer and the later scenes I was screaming ""CUT!"" at the movie. Acting is solid through out the movie although the movie really just centres around FDR and Laurens relationship because Tuck and her don't have any chemistry really. There are about... four fights, they use shaky cam and you cant tell what was happening, for some reason when FDR and Tuck fight its really short and Tuck takes most of the hits. There are a few good scenes in the movie but I didn't laugh that much apart from Tucks date scene that I found amusing as he guns down teenagers and man-handles others in a paint ball game.",2012
1,"I thought this was a terrible movie. The wrong guy definitely won (the jerk) AND I don't see why you have to have 10 lines minimum for a submission either. I'm pretty sure a one line comment is enough to accurately describe a stupid movie: ""This means war"" is a prime example of a stupid movie. The fact that they have to warn people about filling in their comments with fluff should tell you something... hasn't IMDb heard of the K.I.S.S principle. If not, they should do some research. The world is a much better place when people keep things simple. Here, if my one line HIGHLY ACCURATE review of the movie isn't enough, I'll add slightly more to fill in the RIDICULOUS ten lines minimum. Girl meets boy- boy is a gentleman. Girl meets another boy. This boy is a jerk. Both boys know each other, but girl doesn't know that. Girl finds out both boys know each other, and instead of doing the logical thing-walking away b/c BOTH are liars, and instead of picking the lesser of two evils (since the movie is based on having to chose), she chooses the jerk.

After venturing into more mature territory with the inspirational sports drama 'We Are Marshall' and the sci-fi thriller 'Terminator: Salvation', the director is back making live-action cartoons in the vein of his 'Charlie's Angels' duo- logy, and 'This Means War' sees him at his most indulgent.

Me, I was rooting for the bad guys to slowly dispose of them in a vat of acid after poking them full of holes, so the acid would hurt more. Aside from that, the characters act like love-struck teen-agers (sorry teen-agers), the action scenes are totally unbelievable (walking up, unguarded, to a trio of assassins guns a-blazing at you, with only a handgun), and oh, don't get me started. Pay attention to what the characters are actually doing, instead of just liking them because you're 'supposed' to, and you'll totally be turned off.

9,"Yes, herein contains some of the most ravishing filmmaking of the new millennium. The period details are abstract yet precise. The score has a stark, primordial allure. It's post-WWII America: Psychologically scarred veterans attempt to cramp themselves back into society. One is loner Freddie Quell, adrift in emotional confusion. He's secured a gig as a portrait photographer at a lavish department store imagined like a temple of indulgent commercialism. But Freddie doesn't last long there. In the darkroom, he screws models and chugs rotgut he makes with photo chemicals. Ultimately, he loses it on a customer, not just hitting him but harassing and lambasting him, working out some indecipherable, irrepressible rage.",2012
9,"The Master is absolutely magnetic, orchestrated brilliantly by writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson and helmed by the commanding turns of Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman.",2012
9,"In a broad sense, The Master tells the story of a soulless drifter, Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix,) constantly drunk and with no purpose in life, finding sanctuary in the company of The Cause, a cult-like group lead by a charismatic intellectual, Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman.) This plot description does not do the film full justice, because with this film, Anderson fully releases himself from the constraints of traditional narrative storytelling. The film is told in a stream-of-consciousness style, loosely linking together vignettes and moments from the time these two men spend together, without any sense of ""drive,"" ""purpose"" or ""goal"" in the traditional screen writing sense. It is a style perfectly befitting the emotional and spiritual state of the main character, Freddie, adrift in life with no anchor or sense of purpose of his own. Throughout the film, Anderson occasionally cuts back to a shot of the wake of a slow-moving ship, placing us, the audience, aimlessly drifting through the narrative, just as Freddie is. What results is a series of scenes, snapshots of events, some narratively linked and some not. The film is very subjective, and puts us squarely in Freddie Quell's mind; as a result, no easy answers are given, many questions remain mysteries, and we never get a firmly grounded sense of reality; many events remain ambiguous and keep us wondering as to their fidelity long after the film is over.",2012
8,"Paul Thomas Anderson's ""The Master"" is a puzzling, often bewildering film. Very few films have left me shaken and stirred and still leave me wondering, ""What was that all about?"" I can't say that I hated the ride. It is, quite simply, a remarkable film from one of America's best filmmakers today. This film is not for everyone, however.",2012
10,"Often in the history of film there have been remarkable gems, hailed by few and ignored by the masses. Over time many of these gain the credit they deserve, Citizen Kane was panned by many critics at the time and only with the passing of time has its influence and brilliance been generally acknowledged. P.T. Anderson's new film The Master may not be Citizen Kane but it is certainly in the same vein. As Orson Welles modeled Charles Foster Kane after William Randolph Hearst, Anderson's new film focuses on another controversial historical figure, L. Ron Hubbard. Like Welles, Anderson treats his characters with the same mixture of examination and empathy that leaves you questioning pre- conceptions and wondering what truly defines an individual.",2012
10,"Unquestionably P.T. Anderson's best film so far. I've always liked his work, but early on I had no sense he would achieve heights such as this. Let me say this, Anderson, ALONE, I think amongst relatively big-budget American filmmakers, allows his imagery to play by its own rules. EVERY other studio filmmaker- from Scorsese to Tarantino, to Jarmusch, plays by some kind of pre-established rules-even if they are the pre-established rules of ""art cinema"" or ""second cinema"". Anderson, like Weerasthakul or Bela Tarr, speaks his own tongue. I thought There Will Be Blood was pretty great, but this is Truly Great- a singularly challenging work of art. Similarly, I would compare Daniel Day-Lewis's work in Blood with Phoenix's work here. The former was impressive, creative, witty. The latter is brave, adventuresome, and merciless. More than any of the ""canonical"" ""method"" performances of cinema, I think Phoenix reaches into places of himself, of all of us, that's very unearthing demands new philosophical questions. Here's my take, for what it's worth, of the ""meaning"" of the film. It's a comparison of two drastically contradictory and complementary personalities. One wants to live without any Master by becoming a Master himself. The other wants a master to give some kind of shape to his life. L. Ron Hubbard- inspired guru Lancaster Dodd (played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman in a performance that's beautiful but not ground-breaking) is a con-man, but as I read him, he's not exactly a charlatan. He truly wants to believe the (self-serving) things he's saying, and he needs other people to believe them too. He's very successful at (least the latter half of) this. But this does not make him free. Instead, it turns him into a kind of King and, as we know from the example of Louis XVI, any sovereign is ultimately a privileged prisoner of his/her subjects. They are exempt from the laws of the land, of life, exactly in so far as others believe they are. Dodd's ""freedom"" from mastery is wholly dependent on the worship of the other, an other outstandingly represented by Phoenix's Freddie Quell, a potentially unbreakable ""scoundrel"" who Dodd both fears and admires as such. Quell is a completely, irredeemably, broken individual, whose only surviving qualities are sheer animal instinct- screw, eat, and drink. He yearns to be put back together, to be mastered by some other, to serve some sovereign and thus be welcomed back into civilization. But he's too far gone, or too savage, for that to work. He can't be mastered, even by any coherent sense of self. Dodd seeks the solitude of the sublime but is ultimately made completely dependent on the Other, while Quell, very unwillingly, achieves the freedom, and loneliness, of God.",2012
1,"I love Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and appreciate most of the other recognizable actor s in this film. This film is too long, too boring, and meanders like a mid-western river. I kept waiting and waiting for the story line to pick up, but it was at it's peak on the floor. Amy Adams played a great antagonist, but her role was stunted. Joaquin Pheonix did well to play an alcoholic with a few cards shy of a deck, but hasn't everyone played that role well? Hoffman was not so disappointing as his material was just not that good. This was not a story line worth making into a movie. I wrote a better ending walking out of the movie theater. After the master proclaims we all have our masters, Freddie bashes in his head with a white statuette. The antagonist returns to the room to find the new master in the chair and she smiles. To heap any platitudes on this movie is to become one with the cause. Stay home, save your money, clean your toilets.",2012

Remarkable in every detail but the detail I appreciate the most is the acting, if one can call it that. Joaquin Phoenix introduced us to a character I had never seen before on the screen. I was compelled, mesmerized. A sensation I hadn't experience since Colin Firth gave us Adrian LeDuc in 1989's ""Apartment Zero"". A total original but solidly planted in a reality that is undeniable. Shattering. Love him or hate him, he's not asking for sympathy on the contrary. He is defiant. Philip Seymour Hoffman adds another spellbinding character to his already extraordinary collection.

Amazing performance that will go next to three other performances that revolutionized the art of acting and create characters that were unique in every way. James Mason in ""Lolita"", Anthony Perkins in ""Psycho"" and even Colin Firth in ""Apartment Zero"" Coincidentally or not none of those three landmarks were nominated for Oscars, let's hope Joaquin Phoenix this time breaks that tradition.

The Master stars Joaquin Phoenix, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Amy Adams in pivotal roles. Anderson is one of the few commercial filmmakers alive today who write their own screenplays. And perhaps that's the reason why he has not been very prolific as a filmmaker—yielding only once every 4-5 years. The Master also marks the return of Joaquin Phoenix from a self-imposed acting break. ",2013
1,"Well, I really wanted to like this one. On paper it's perfect. Director/writer Paul Thomas Anderson, cast headed by Joaquin Phoenix, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and Amy Adams. What could go wrong? The script. If a movie doesn't start with a good script, it can't turn out well. There is no crest to this story. And there is no denouement. It lays flat for over two hours. The actors give great performances and the scenes are constructed well. Joaquin Phoenix has moments that are tragic. And then the movie just plods on. I am fine with a film that develops slowly. I'm not fine with a film that never develops. Is it about an alcoholic? No. Is it about a cult leader? No. It's random moments, between an alcoholic and a cult leader, strung together, with no direction, and no narrative. You could extract any scene from this film, and on it's own it would stand up well. Pieced together, however, they don't add up to a story. ",2012
1,"Certainly the worst film I have seen this year and contender for the bottom 10 of all time, this was uninteresting, poorly directed and frankly rather annoying and pretentious. The acting was okay and could have been good if they hadn't had such poor direction. The music was intrusive, particularly at the beginning (you should never notice a good film score, but you couldn't escape from this one), the storyline was non-existent and the characters unsympathetic - a pretty lethal combination. When Phillip Seymour Hoffman started singing and all the females in the scene suddenly appeared naked, I just had to laugh and from then on, each idiotic new ""sensational"" set-up just made me laugh more. And it DRAGGED - the longest 137 minutes of my life. I would have walked out well before the end, but I was with my wife, who said the only reason she didn't walk out was that she wanted to see me suffer as payback for making her sit through ""The Tree of Life"", which oddly enough we both thought of as we endured this ""Modern American Classic"" - I suspect that the silliness on the beach brought it to mind. Why can't modern Directors (a) learn to edit properly and (b) entertain us? Appalling.",2012

After MI-6 is attacked and M (Dench) is brought under scrutiny by the government Bond (Craig) alone is left to find out who is behind the attack while M is trying to both help Bond and defend the need for an agency that has been compromised. I know that a review is really not needed here, being the 23rd Bond movie either you will watch it or not. I am a huge fan of the series and was really looking forward to this after hearing this is the best Bond movie yet. I have really loved the Craig movies but for some reason they never had the feel of a Bond movie to me, I wasn't sure what was missing but they didn't have the same feel. Knowing that they were re-booting the series I was lenient and with this one the re-boot is complete. This had much more of a feel of a classic Bond movie and by the end I was excited to see the next one. I got chills watching a few times and especially at the end. This had possibly the best opening and ending to a Bond movie ever. I could go on and on about this but I will just say if you love Bond you will love this, if you have never seen one then this one will make you a fan. Overall, From Russia With Love is my favorite Bond movie but this a very close second, and I think may be more re-watchable. I wanted to watch this one again as soon as the movie was over. I give this a very high A.",2013

A glamorous life full of suspense and intrigue. Skyfall has no suspense, intrigue or glamour (save for Berenice) and as such is not escapism and not a 'Bond film'.

I hadn't really thought about it, but once it was pointed out, I realised that for about 2 months before the release, you couldn't move for the billboards, bus-side ads, TV and radio spots, over-hyped theme song etc etc. I concluded it must be partly because it's the 50th anniversary, but I always worry when a film is this over-hyped, because it's very very difficult to meet expectations this high. Also, there's a danger people will have decided they love the movie before they even see it, and I think that's what's happened here. It's the Emperor's New Clothes. This is an average movie, at best.",2012

9,"This is one of the best Bond movies I have ever seen. The story is superbly put together and has some interesting twists, the action is well done and contains none of the shaky cam which plagued the last film. The actors all do a great job. Some might still be put off by Daniel Craig's rough version of Bond, but I like it and he even has a few good old fashioned one-liners here. I wasn't sure about Javier Bardem as the villain at first. I thought he was a tad too flamboyant but eventually he grew on me, plus he had a very interesting backstory and as you might have guessed already, Judi Dench is fantastic as usual as M and she even has more to do in the story this time arround. This is not a completely formulaic Bond movie. Craig's bond is still more emotional than Connery or Moore ever were and for the first time we get some relatively detailed descriptions of his childhood. And something happens to Bond in the start of the movie that affects him for the rest of the film. But despite all that there are tons of James Bond trademarks like the martini, the introduction and even Q. Some might not like this new very young version of Q but I found him to be funny and very likable. They will never top Desmond Llewelyn's original performance, and instead of making a cheap Llewelyn clone, they make a completely different character which I think is the only right thing to do. This is not only a great Bond movie but just a downright great film.",2012

1,Major spoilers ahead.,2012
6,"If your prime reaction to a film is one of disappointment there are usually some good reasons. My principal response to this version of a great and well-known story is one of irritation. The overblown theatrical format of the film gets in the way of character and dramatic development, to the point where you're aware of a director proclaiming ""aren't we clever with the way we're staging this?"" instead of admiring the straightforward and competent telling of a story. I'm not saying all films have to be constructed in a conventional manner, but when the form overtakes the substance something has gone wrong.",2012
1,"So, it is out – the film that so far has divided the opinions of the critics and audiences alike. A lot has been said about its theatrics and casting, visual effects and costumes. The trailer alone made me go to see it the first day it was released in London. Despite the misgivings about the casting of the main characters, I was hoping that the opulence of the setting, decorations and costumes would be just enough to make it enjoyable and compensate for any acting mishaps.

I said OK, Keira as Anna, it will be difficult to watch, her being such an inappropriate actress for this role, but in the end all the other parts of the movie made me say this is a huge waste of time... If you haven't read the book it will be very difficult to understand what this movie is about. The actors are poor, except Jude Law, their accent is also bad. The fact that they turned it into a low-budget movie just makes me really upset. It is over-directed, it is a kitsch.",2013
7,"I adore the novel, so I will be discussing Joe Wright's take on it and where it ranks amongst other adaptations but I will of course look at its merits as a film aside from the novel.",2012
2,"This new ""adaptation"" is nonsense. Tolstoy's novel is about a woman who belonged to the upper class that governed the Great Russia, the country extending from Atlantic Ocean to Pacific Ocean, from Arctics to Afghanistan. Why is that Vonsky's mother, a princess by the title, is sharing a bench with senator Karenin's wife in a second class car where her son, price Vronsky finds them somewhere between third and the 4th raw? Their wealth allowed them to travel in a separate car and they often did! We were told from the screen that it was Russia of 1874. Well then how comes that Anna's ""son"" plays with train toys that run... on batteries? The cancan was normal for the working-class ballrooms of Montparnasse, but not for the aristocracy of Russian Empire exactly because it contradicted to aristocratic education and highly developed sense of taste. And amidst all of this nonsense we hear a bunch of ""sub–Russian"" ""aj-lu-lu"" songs that would be appropriate for the poor villagers but not for the Russian Aristocracy of this time. The movie appears to be staged in the backstage of a Café chantant. I was shocked to see that there is a hen sitting on the bookcase in Oblonsky's study. And why the Karenin's bedroom is situated in a huge hall with many columns in it? And his servants dressed as servants in bistro? Servants of aristocracy had to wear ""la livrea"", a livery, a uniform! I have impression that ladies jewelries were rented from a local Macy's store, while the entire picture was filmed in an abandoned provincial theater with broken walls and bad floor. And please notice that soup Marie-Louise is always with asparagus, so it is as inappropriate to mention this to the guests of Stiva Oblonsky's dinner. Extremely bad taste is obvious from about all scenes of the film. But so is the idea of this movie. We were offered just another attempt to present an adultère with a little bit attachment to un époux Russe. Unlike the world of commoners, Anna was not granted the freedom of choice because her divorce and remarriage was to be approved by the Most Holly Sinod, and the divorce lawyer, who was omitted from the film, was quite clear about this issue in his conversation with Karenin. This is why the drama had to be moved from the formal level to individual qualities of the people involved. And the only one who in my opinion reached this goal on behalf of Tolsoy was Jude Law, who was excellent as new Karenin lacking the common impression of a ridiculed husband. I understand that the ""stamping"" clerks from Oblonsky's office was added to the whole venture by Mrs. Wright and Stoppard as a token of their appreciation of Russian Avant-garde theatre, but it only enhanced the feeling of totally lost control over the flow of the drama. I am greatly disappointed. In my opinion, this film lacks good taste, understanding of Tolstoy's original idea, understanding of the characters, the time and circumstances of the drama, which together constitute a minimum requirement for a fair cinematography for classics adaptation. Don't even think to offer this thing to Russian viewers, because it will cause nothing but a belly laugh. Try to find and enjoy the Anna Karenina (1967) directed by great Aleksandr Zarkhi: this is a true piece of art, colorful and careful to every detail, the highest expression of a family drama without exits that explains its tragic end.",2012
2,"Closed in and Claustrophobic: I felt I could breathe only when the scenes escaped outside of the theater stage and onto the snow covered train depot or the green fields where Levin was sowing grass, or where love was a lazy-day picnic on the greenest of grasses, but only briefly and only disappointingly, after again finding myself cramped and stifled in a hot sweltering and old 19th century theater. ",2012
1,"Seriously? I thought I was watching the wrong movie. It looked like Kevin Kline was one of the first actors. With the smirks and feeble attempts at humor it couldn't be the right movie. No offense to Kevin Kline, but A Fish Called Wanda vibe isn't what I expected in this movie. It felt as if I was seeing a play on film without editing out the set changes.",2013
1,"If an award were given for over-directing, this would win hands down. it's a tribute to Tolstoy that his story came through the fog of metaphor and cliché, from the stage set play-within-a-movie (our only guess as to meaning is that they were skimping on location shooting) to actors twirling around each other to tearing up letters (and with them any semblance of meaning to life) - to the point of tossing the scraps up, only to come down as snow (could it get worse?).",2012
1,Not much to say except this film is arty farty pretentious rubbish. Was looking forward to watching an engrossing film of a good book but after the first 30 mins gave up trying to understand what the heck was going on. Only glad that I hadn't paid to watch it if I had I would have been strongly tempted to ask for my money back. It would appear that the producers think that the inclusion of Keira Knightly is enough to guarantee box office success how wrong can they be. Whoever came up with the format of this film needs their head examining it may appeal to the cinema snobs but as far as the general public is concerned it's a candidate for the raspberry award.,2013
8,"I once asked Dustin Hoffman if he had any favorite movies or actors. He replied that he had favorite performances. Referring it seemed, to much smaller periods within a film. There are several shots where Keira is picture perfect, but this role was not for her. This performance ruins our memory of her former success under Joe Wright. Especially her first, which is her most unforgettable. Black Swan did the same for Natalie Portman, another of our cinema sweethearts. Which I walked out of. ",2013
1,"I have never written a film review or offered an opinion on any site, but this movie drove me to it. Taking liberties with a great classic for the sake of making it film-worthy is one thing, but this confused and confusing attempt wound up less than effective and an interminable bore to boot. The history is muddled, the opulent costumes are not authentically of any period, let alone Russia of the time, and the scenery and stage sets add nothing but artifice to the overall effect. I won't attempt the wooden acting, or maybe that's the miserable direction, but the fictional yet palpable character of Anna Karenina has been wholly lost to some unrecognizable whim.",2012
10,"Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina is one of the most acclaimed novels of all time, not least of all because of the excellence of the book's themes. These themes of Tolstoy's are expressed extremely well in Joe Wright's adaptation of Anna Karenina. First and foremost and the area that really sets the film apart is the theatricality of certain settings in the film. Many scenes take place on sets made to resemble the stage, especially early on. I was initially baffled by this choice but I slowly came to realize that it functions as a way to make visual the artificiality of the world inhabited by Anna Karenina, specifically its outdated values. It's extremely clear that Russia was undergoing a major transition during the time in which the narrative is set. Trains and railways play a major role in the film and of course trains are a common symbol of technological progress. There's more than passing reference to the freeing of the serfs and the radical ideology even of some aristocrats, which echoes the life of Tolstoy himself. Much is also made of the cultural shifts in Moscow and St. Petersburg, the former of which had apparently become rather old-fashioned compared to the relatively progressive Petersburg at the time. The film suggests that the reaction of the country's upper class was to ignore the major changes that were occurring and cling all the harder to the past, especially with regards to social institutions. Thus the eponymous heroine finds it impossible to escape her loveless marriage with any social standing intact, which eventually drives her mad. ",2013
9,"Director Joe Wright's adaptation of Leo Tolstoy's 1877 novel Anna Karenina is one of the most visually stunning and artistically bold films I've seen in quite some time. Wright places most of his plot within the confines of a dilapidated theatre and has his actors make use of the stage, stalls and behind the scenes areas when forming the sets of late Tsarist Saint Petersburg. Actors will walk from one part of the theatre to another with sets and costumes changing around them, all with the hustle and bustle of both a real theatre and lively city. It's a stylistic decision which was probably met with scepticism by studio bosses and the like but works incredibly well to bring to life the characters which themselves are so wonderfully written by Tolstoy.",2012

1,"What a huge disappointment. I waited since summer for this movie. I am a huge Pride & Prejudice lover. The movie was dull, boring, incredibly distant from the passion of Anna and her lover. Aaron Johnson looked gay. Matthew MacFadyen was ridiculously frivolous and poor Mr. Gleeson was entirely out of place, out of his element and had less sex appeal than a rodent. Insufficient development of Anna's marriage. She just cried throughout. Using a stage as a prop was also ridiculous! Really? A stage? How boring. I nodded half way through and only stayed til the end out of stubborness. What a disappointment. Joe Wright had an opportunity to take us on a Russian voyage and he blew it! I'm still hopping mad.",2012
1,"Despite the title, let me begin anew by stating that I absolutely love Joe Wright. He makes beautiful films, and this one is not the exception. However, the script was nonsensical and lacked any sort of sensitivity or heart (why is Anna even supposed to fall for Vronsky in this version? And, why should we care? this movie did not give us reason to do so), (most of) the acting (save Macfadyen, Macdonald, Williams, and sometimes Taylor- Johnson) was ridiculous and over-the-top, and the encompassing of the theater - while a brilliant idea - was completely lacking for an on-screen venture.",2012

Worst casting in the history of film, period!!!! Never have so many gorgeous actors been turned ugly! It is unwatchable, it makes me sick. Levin is THE WORST casted actor I have ever seen and I am shocked and appalled and disgusted ! It is horrendous....It is offensive to the people who have actually read the book, to the book itself, the characters that made history and above all the genius himself, Lav Nikolajevič Tolstoj. Music doesn't suit the film, the actors don't suit the parts, the idea itself is beyond horrific, the setting, the idea of the idea, there are not enough bad words to describe this.... I've heard stories about this film and I didn't want to believe them because of my love and respect for Matthew Macfadyen, Keira Knightley, Jude Law and many others who worked on the film, but sadly I was let down by these great people who disappointed me beyond words... This is a sad world we live in, where anyone can make a film..... This kind of butchering should be considered a crime against ART!!",2013

I saw the movie yesterday afternoon in Paris and came out of the theater wondering why had I lost my money and time for such a nonsense. There is absolutely nothing in this film worth retaining. The director and his scenery designer took obviously an immense pleasure in presenting the story in a sophisticated setting making all they could to mislead the spectator especially if he has not read the novel! Aestheticism can be interesting to use but in limited amount If I may say so, too much make up on a beautiful face will make of it a horrifying masquerade and this is what happens here.",2012
10,"First. What is a definition of the word ""critical art review""? Review is imposition of individual opinion through the press. During my long life (I am 72) I have seen many performances on the stage and movies ""Anna Karenina."" This film is the best. It has everything that should be in the movie: fantasy, entertainment, teaching, and of course the classic love story. For me, personally, it is not always important ""WHAT ABOUT"", it is also important to me ""HOW IT DONE."" From my point of view, movie is entertainment. Of course those critics who finds fault with hairstyles or jewelry, they know better what they want from the movies. They always want to hear a Russian accent and see plausible buttons on the dress. But this is not a police report, this is feature film. Visual aspects are amazingly talented. Acting work- to the point of perfection. First time in my life I saw real Karenin, not half-dead old man, but a loving decent husband. Keira Knightley is impeccable as Anna. Сrowd scenes are tasteful. Music is touching and talented. Tolstoy's novel is very hard to adapt for a screen, it even difficult to read, and the director was able to convey the main thing in this beautiful and romantic movie. I agree with Berthold Brecht who said: ""When you entertain -teach, and when you teach- entertain""."" There is no doubt that this film is not for everyone, and those who like ""Scream 2"" or "" Spiderman"", they do not have to watch this movie. All critical reviews are long and tedious, but the film is short, with exciting feelings and has a good taste. There is only one measure of art: talented or not talented. The rest is a matter of taste. But there is no accounting for tastes.This film is talented in every way.",2012
2,"I thoroughly disliked this version of the story. The very presentation, mostly within one theater and stage setting was distracting to say the least. The brief interludes of actual scenery were lovely but far too few and short. Some of the dialog was somewhat muffled, resulting in misidentification of a few characters, initially. I can't imagine whose idea this was but I'm not surprised to read of the fine actors who turned it down after reading the concept. The characters who elicited an emotional reaction from me were Kitty and Constantin; those actors were so real that I was moved to tears by the depth of their facial expressions and vocalizations. I felt the nudity was totally unnecessary and the depiction of smoking just silly. I looked forward to this remake but was sorely disappointed and cannot in all good conscience recommend it to anyone.",2012
10,"There have been many cinematic versions of Leo Tolstoy's epic novel ANNA KARENINA but for this viewer none matches the creative excellence and power of this very different version. Tom Stoppard wrote the screenplay for this adaptation and the work was directed with eye toward timeless artistry by Joe Wright. There will be some detractors who feel that cinema is cinema and stage plays are stage plays, but Wright's decision to combine the two works extraordinarily well. The flavor of Tolstoy's story and mood are maintained and yet made somehow more vital by Wright's electing to place this story as though it were happening on a theater stage (including catwalks, backstage, audience and theater boxes etc.) The story is theatrical and Wright embellishes the last of the Czarist days with great aplomb.",2012
10,"This version of ""Anne Karenina"" is certainly more interesting than previous ones, and as it has happened before with films by Wright, he has gone into a sort of interesting mix of realism, and I'm not quite sure what to call this, ""getting inside the visual media""... At first, I was a bit dumbfounded, as he kept rolling walls, switching scenery in the middle of a scene. It was a bit unsettling, but then, I thought it was a matter of style, and because he does keep a decent amount of period set decoration and costume, I got used to his approach.",2012

After watching it I have a feeling it's just a collection of cool ideas put together without any logic to link them.

The film may or may not be directly linked to the original Alien film, however upon viewing, you will realise that Prometheus is very much a prequel of sorts.",2012
1,"I just saw this film last night and the travesty is still fresh in my mind. First up, every negative review on IMDb is 100% accurate. I wont therefore reiterate what has already been said, and said well, by many distressed fans of the original Alien film.",2012
10,"I found this movie to be completely perfect. The acting was top notch, the visuals and effects were stunning, the plot was smartly developed and kept the tension at an all time high, and even the score was brilliant. ",2012
1,"This movie looked gorgeous and I enjoyed the acting of both Fassbender and Theron but this story was awful. It was so bad I have to say that I consider it one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I'm not a harsh critic, I love most movies I see or usually, feel at worst, neutral. I can think of so many questions, it is easier just to list them.",2013
1,"The irony is that while 'Alien' was a film with a modest budget that desperately tried to use the available resources to pull off the look of an A-film, 'Prometheus' is a film with a monstrous budget that doesn't even seem to aspire to rise above the B-movie level - with the exception of special effects.",2012

1,*WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!*,2012
1,"I'm a huge sci-fi fan and also an admirer of Scott's work, but I'm probably not going to watch a movie solely because it was directed by him anymore. This was probably one of the worst movies I've seen in the past few years, including a few that were made for TV.",2012
5,I totally agree with the blog posted on Dawn.com regarding this movie by Nadeem F. Paracha.,2013
7,"It's not an action flick, it's a thriller. About a tough CIA-chick who has a hunch about a guy who might eventually lead them to Osama Bin Laden. It takes her almost 10 years, a little waterboarding, a couple of dead colleagues and a lot of arguing with her superiors, but she manages to follow the lead all the way to the now famous raid in Abbottabad.",2013
1,I want to thank Kate B for adding to my knowledge. Really. I had no idea that Abbottabad was an Arabic-speaking city where most of the world's camels come to take a nap as the dunes of the desert silhouette them against the setting sun.,2013
7,"""Zero Dark Thirty"" is a grim, clinical depiction of the CIA search for Osama bin Laden. Its strongest feature is its dramatization of the Navy Seal Team 6 operation in Abbottabad, Pakistan, that killed bin Laden. That sequence is so professionally shot it could be actual documentary footage. ",2013
1,After watching Zero Dark Thirty I am simply amazed at the critical reception it's received. In fact it's one of the most bizarre and puzzling critical reactions I've seen since more than 60% of critics liked Spiderman III on rottentomatoes To me this is simply not a good film. In fact I wouldn't even be as kind to call it merely OK or middling. I believe it's flat out bad.,2013
5,"I was honestly expecting a lot more, given the multiple nominations for awards. I really thought this movie was overdone and could have been pared down by at least 45 minutes. In the end, it was just a glorified ""we killed bin laden"" pseudo-documentary. The character relationships never developed and seemed empty. And I didn't really find the main actress very believable or that great. Scenes of shooting dead bodies also were probably a bit too much -- overall this movie seemed overly nationalistic and simplistic without delivering much in the way of content. I thought Hurt Locker was a significantly better movie. Again, I am somewhat surprised at the number of award nominations this movie received.",2013
10,I'm not claiming that this movie is 100% factual or even close to it but I think the filmmaker did a brilliant job of chronicling the UBL saga. IMO the theme of the movie in a nutshell is this: We got this guy (maybe?) but at what cost and were we justified? These are not easy questions to answer and they are left open ended for the most part.,2013
5,"Poor screenplay, poor dialogs, extremely bad actors and some strange and disturbing way of directing for a two hour and a half movie. The film is boring, the plot is childish and Maya it seems to be a little bit psychotic. Kathryn Bigelow tried the Hurt Locker recipe once again but this time her way to shoot just couldn't make anything understandable and bearable. Sometimes steady, most of time shaky, the camera is so confusing, especially in small spaces that you don't know what the director want to say anymore....",2013
5,"If this movie had been entirely fictional, I would have given it 2 stars. The importance of the story and the care taken in some parts gave it 5.",2013
10,i came into this movie not expecting much after reading all the hatred and i honestly was blown away by both the movie and confusion at the negativity towards it.,2013
1,"""The greatest manhunt in history"". Well, Dark Zero Thirty movie clearly does not show this! I had way more thrills following the manhunt of the fake Abu Nazir in the TV show Homeland than in this propaganda- movie.",2013
1,"I was a crewchief assigned to the Group that lifted the SEALS to Abbatobad. I will not make claims I am associated with the mission, because I wasn't. Nonetheless, this movie disappointed me to the point I fell asleep at the 1 hour mark. Without going into a rant, I would hope everyone understands the actual events. ""Maya"" didn't sacrifice anything; she did find UBL, but was well compensated financially the entire time she was looking. The basis of this movie is her work finding UBL, which makes my stomach turn. It's so easy to sit behind a keyboard and act like you are changing the world. Her line in the movie to ""kill Bin Laden for me"" will resonate until my death. I can promise you, UBL wasn't killed for Maya and it is pretty obvious that once he was found, the true heroes were summoned. Her remarks in the movie about ""you guys showing up with your facial hair and dip"" is so disullionist, it should be edited. She is a coward and her glorification in this movie sickens me.",2013
10,"This movie isn't for everyone. It isn't for people who are vehemently anti-torture. It isn't for people who need a feel-good story with a happy ending. That being said, this movie had me literally on the edge of my seat for 2 1/2 hours and is a fantastic f-ing movie.",2013
1,"WASTED time. A LOT of wasted time.""Cold war style propaganda"", that I thought was supposed to end decades ago. Overrated ""movie"" by overrated director. There was absolutely nothing of the story I could catch in first hour, maybe hour and half, if not the whole two! I don't really understand why this was created. Maybe if the main actress was Dennis Rodman. Maybe if there was Chuck Norris in the SEAL team. Maybe if there was at least 1/5 of the facts accurate (and Im talking about facts that are just known about this manhunt). Maybe if there was a team of transformers or comic cartoon heroes supporting this action. Maybe if somewhere in Pakistan, Charlie Chaplin fell into sewer because of some banana . Then maybe it would have 2 stars from me.",2013
1,"The first half of the movie is about CIA operatives interrogating terrorists. Water boarding is being shown as the only world of torture. The terrorists, pretty unimpressed by all this, respond with a bad- ass attitude while bombings continue. Meanwhile the CIA employees show emotional outbursts and are unable to make professional decisions.",2013
1,"Knowing this movie was nominated for best picture, I was afraid that I was losing my mind after seeing it, since what I saw in the theater was: one dimensional characters being frustrated about not being able to do anything, inter-cut with a newsreel about current events, followed a ridiculously overdone operation to kill a couple people in a house.",2013
1,"This should have been good, I really wanted it to be good. At the very least it should have been interesting. Unfortunately, it took 2.5 hours to tell 45 minute's worth of story... This film needed some serious editing- too many scenes seemed forced, out of place or just thrown in with little explanation or necessity... For example- why include the scene asking Maya about being recruited to the CIA right after high school, then drop the topic saying she can't explain why- it didn't do anything to move the story along- and left me wondering ""what was that about???"" I mean- would the answer to why she was recruited make her motives and obsessions more understandable? What was the viewer supposed to take away from that conversation? Skip watching this one in the theater- if you must watch it out of curiosity, wait until it comes out on DVD or cable- then at least you're only losing your time and not a handful of hard earned cash.",2013
7,"Greetings again from the darkness. Kathryn Bigelow entered the realm of elite directors when her war thriller The Hurt Locker exploded onto the Oscar scene a few years ago. Once again she proves why the critics adore her, and the movie going masses stay away. She is an expert filmmaker, a brilliant technician, though not much into the whole entertainment scene.",2013
4,"I hate to be so contrary to the hype we are hearing and the Oscar tap, but I was not impressed nor even that entertained... in fact I had just commented to my companion movie goer that the lead character had not been very impressive when she finally had some acting to perform... the scene where she gave the station chief an ultimatum... the rest of the story was choppy and not cohesive and as much as I was pumped when the actual take down occurred, I was not pumped at all in the movie's take down... at any rate as much as some seem to appreciate this movie, I on the other hand would not recommend spending the money to see it... Argo was much better.",2013
1,"Mrs. Bigelow is obsessed with obsession. Blue Steel, Point Break, the Hurt Locker, now Zero Dark Thirty. The background of the story changes, but the story remains the same. Behind different faces, the same obsessive character. The obsession portrayed in her films actually is quite simplistic and straightforward, but anyhow, in our time her ""oeuvres"" are considered as deep, realistic, and arty. After an adrenaline fix come the inevitable frustration and emptiness of living, Mrs. Bigelow shows it to us over and over again; her hero has a conniving streak in him/her, but a hero nevertheless. She's so focused on her obsessed character, it's easy for her to claim that the Iraq war film she made was apolitical, and ZDT, a political thriller, has no political agenda. ",2013
1,The only question I have in me is: Is this movie done to shock and ask why America is spiting on human rights? or is it to justify it? Technically the movie is fine and the actors good as it succeeded to make me dislike them. It is a pity that the message is so unclear. Ah no yes ... message is torture helped us to fight evil...,2013
10,"One's appeal for Zero Dark Thirty is to see how it depicts the search for Osama Bin Laden like it seems too impossible to find him, like he's probably already dead, or almost doesn't exist. Even though there are controversies going around and some revelations, the story is still all dramatized. Without a surprise from director Kathryn Bigelow, the film is totally electrifying and deliberately engrossing. There is humanity left in the end that made this a lot more compelling, but that's the last thing we should talk about. It never backs away from the promise and stays focus on the mission. Zero Dark Thirty is a powerfully gripping thriller.",2013
1,"This should be on Lifetime or Hallmark channel. Not only was it completely inaccurate, it had you wondering was the US really that incompetent regarding the search for UBL. A civilian can't even get in a military base in America without going through intensive screening, yet, somehow, a Military base, in Afghanistan, (that contains a CIA Black site, no less.), allows a known Al Quaida member to just drive on in, no check point, nothing. And...yes, you know what's coming next...KA-BOOM! I wont even get into the ""texting"" between the 2 Female Agents.",2013
1,"One need patience to watch this. To see the country who bring us the modern democracy using the KGB ""tools"" - and all of this for nothing - make me sick. Same parts of this ""movie"" remember me the black-and-withe Nazi propaganda documentaries. Shooting female civilian in the back its not a heroic act. Not even in a war. Never was. I have some doubts about what real happened on that night in Pakistan. Why the most wanted was not taken alive. Submitted to a Court. Show him to the world and let the American people to judge him. Interrogate him. Using the law to make justice. Nothing of this was answered. All the movie its like a very bad documentary about assassination and torture . ",2013
10,"I've seen all the reasons viewers (and some critics) dislike this film, but in my opinion it is infinitely superior to ARGO in its authenticity and dramatic quality. The final scenes, when the SEAL team, goes into Ben Laden's house, are brilliantly rendered. The idea of doing it mostly in the dark with flashes of illumination by ""night vision"" green is a brilliant touch, which most directors would never have attempted. ",2013
9,"Saw this just now in a small indie cinema in Heidelberg, Germany and I have to say, it was a romp. In my humble opinion this film manages to be both Wes Anderson's funniest picture so far and his most melancholic. The utter uncompromising stylishness of his other work is also present here, perhaps even heightened, but in contrast to The Life Aquatic (and to a certain degree The Darjeeling Limited), the emphasis here is firmly on plot. The brave and often odd visuals never overwhelm the story and the audience never feels like they are not quite in on the joke, like in The Life Aquatic. The tone does tend to become a bit erratic, especially in the last third of the film when Anderson seems to want to pack so much into every frame that the film becomes a bit cartoonish at times (hence the not-perfect score from me). All in all, though, the plot is very balanced and the pacing is great. The two young leads are superb and the brave move by Anderson to place unknown actors front and centre pays off beautifully. The rest of the cast is on paper even more star-studded than The Royal Tenenbaums and yet Anderson never steers into unnecessary character development just to accommodate his stars. A touch here and a touch there are more than enough to paint a picture of a group of people who are eerily similar in their dissatisfaction with their lives and yet react quite differently to the two young lovers' dash (literally) for happiness. In conclusion, a must-see for Anderson fans and highly recommended for everyone else.",2012
10,"Let's try to understand the miracle I have just witnessed. Director Wes Anderson is 12 years old, has just experienced his first love while at Summer camp, and immediately rushed to a camera to tell us, his pen pals, the story. A slightly embellished story which follows the perfect scenarios we would draw at night in our beds at this age. It has all the tiny details, the sense of adventure and the freshness of youth. How someone 43 years old in real life could do this movie is beyond me. The drawback of this miracle for the viewer is that such a jump back into the kind of idealized feelings you had in your early teens leaves you with quite some melancholy when you leave the cinema.",2012
8,"The year is 1965 and a remote North Eastern coastal community is plunged into confusion when it discovers that two kids have run away. Sam, a discontented Khaki Scout, and Suzy, a put-upon older sister and forgotten daughter, abscond into the forest to escape their dissatisfying existences. The responsible adults – Sam's Scout Master Ward (Edward Norton) and Suzy's parents (Bill Murray and Frances McDormand) – and the entire town set out on a frenzied search, which gets wild when the largest storm in recorded history touches down and puts everyone's life into question. What ensues is a battle between youth and age, hope and disillusionment, faith and cynicism.",2012
10,"In the past, Anderson has whirled us from melancholy dreamscapes set deep below the Pacific to tales of inter-generation betrayals in the name of love, from doomed romances in Paris hotels to deliriously bizarre animal revolutions in the English countryside. But for all the retro-stylings his films so proudly wear, Moonrise Kingdom is Anderson's first period piece - a tender love story set in the sepia-soaked sixties of Anderson's youth that have worked their influence into every one of his movies. It is fitting that this film is his most childlike - not in any way any simpler than his other films (as anyone with an accurate memory of childhood will remember all it's complexities; the way each trivial thing became a nest of thorns), but an accurate and deeply heartfelt depiction of childhood. It is not aiming to be as crushingly dramatic as Life Aquatic or as deeply tragic as Hotel Chevalier, because that wouldn't be appropriate for the story it's trying to tell. Instead, while still bearing Anderson's still surprising streak of black humour (some acts of violence really catch you off-guard; then again, children are violent so hats off Wes), it is largely concerned with the dramas and tragedies of youth. Yes, it is less ambitious than say The Life Aquatic but it also has none of the flaws that that film does (and believe me, I am a massive Steve Zissou fan). Instead, it is perfectly executed, wonderfully acted poignant beauty, with fantastic performances across the board (especially from newcomers Gilman and Hayward). This, while not his most ambitious, is certainly Anderson's most perfect work so far. You owe it to yourself to see this movie.",2012
10,"Despite the dreadful title, Moonrise Kingdom is simply wonderful. ",2012
9,"The thing that I enjoy most about Wes Anderson films is that they each feel like a great adventure and in this sense I think Moonrise Kingdom is his best yet. It tells that tale of Sam, an orphan on scout camp, and Suzy, a misunderstood girl, as they run away together. At first I found the two actors playing the kids to be kind of limp but after a few minutes I warmed to them and I actually think they were both pretty good overall, particularly Jared Gilman who plays Sam and even more so knowing that it's the first acting he's ever done. The rest of the cast are all pursuing or helping them in some way and there a couple of sub-plots with the island's policeman (played by Bruce Willis) and the parents of Suzy (Bill Murray and Frances McDormand).",2012
10,I loved this movie! One of Wes Anderson's best - up there with Rushmore and Fantastic Mr Fox. Top reasons to see this movie: ,2012
10,"If you've been following Mr. Anderson's relatively short career, you'll find more of the same here: a film that is full of quirkiness, which I find to be parables of the troubles we encounter in life. I came to this film without any expectations, having read nothing about it in the news so I was pleasantly surprised that the main protagonists are a couple of tweens. Any fears of mine finding a sappy or saccharine story were vanquished and replaced with wonderment following the journey of the two main characters. Both actors didn't seem to have formal training but this didn't stop them from serving the story well. It is down to the genius of Mr. Anderson capturing their human performances which are nothing less than beautiful.",2012
9,"It's 1965 and pre teen pen pals, Sam (Jared Gilman) and Suzy (Kara  Heywood) agree to run away from home and meet up a year after meeting  for the first time. While the two of them head off into the wilderness  of Suzy's twelve mile long home island a search party that includes  Island Policeman Bruce Willis, Scout leader Edward Norton, Suzy's  parents Bill Murray and Frances McDormand and Sam's fellow Scouts set  about trying to hunt the eloping children down in the days preceding a  huge storm.  I should say from the outset that I am a huge Wes Anderson fan and have  absolutely loved all of his films with the exception of Fantastic Mr  Fox so I went in expecting great things. My expectations were matched  and even perhaps exceeded. I loved this film. Anderson sets up Suzy's  home life in a fantastic opening sequence which features some exquisite  tracking shots through the family home. Before anything is said it is  already obvious to the audience that Suzy is a loner who longs for  something bigger, something more. Her parents do not get on and are  never even seen in the same room, let alone talking to each other. She  has three younger brothers who appear to get along very well. Her house  is large and well furnished, indicating wealth if not happiness. All of  this is established in one long sequence of beautiful camera movements  which last no longer than a couple of minutes. Sam's life with his  Scout troupe is shown in a similar manner although it soon becomes  apparent that he has already escaped in search of his love, Suzy.  One of the things I love about all of Anderson's films is that you  could turn on the TV at pretty much any moment during any of his films  and within a few moments be sure that you are watching a Wes Anderson  film. His style is very distinctive and it's all over his latest work.  The shots are framed to perfection and each camera movement feels  measured but not forced. There is a vague pastel and brown tint to  everything which matches the film's period setting. Everything from the  sets to the characters also feels slightly off centre and as though  they inhabit the same world as The Royal Tenenbaums and The Darjeeling  Limited. Anderson not only creates his own world for each film but his  films feel somehow connected and as though they too inhabit the same  slightly odd world.  The plot is absolutely delightful and sweet. It's such a touching and  loving story which also feels like a love letter to the children's  adventure books of which Suzy reads throughout the film. Though they  read these books, the children long for an adventure of their own and  have finally embarked on one. The characters are equally enchanting.  Sam and Suzy are somehow both old beyond their years but also very much  still children. They have obvious intelligence and wisdom but convey it  through a child's eyes. They are on the cusp of adulthood but somewhere  in between. The acting of Hayward and Gilman is superb and again both  feel both older than they are but also very child like. They are great.  The adult characters are also great without exception. Bruce Willis is  a sad and lonely cop who patrols a quiet island and although he has his  faults is very kind and caring. Edward Norton is an exemplary leader  who also has a big heart while Bill Murray and Frances McDormand, both  lawyers, talk to each other using mostly legal language and although  are not really in love with each other, care a lot for their children  and want the best for them. There are also small cameos from Jason  Schwartzman, Harvey Keitel and Tilda Swinton, all three of which were  welcome and provided something. The adult cast on the whole was  fantastic.  The score goes perfectly with the on screen action and features a  mixture of militaristic marching music, classical and 60s pop. They  somehow all work together and help to push the story on to it's  frenetic final act.  This is a film with a big heart, lovely story and plenty of laughs.  Although I only just saw it I already can't wait to see it again. It's  everything you'd expect from a Wes Anderson film but as well as being  unusual, wacky and nice to look at also has a sweet story about  adolescence, growing up and first love.",2012
4,"So let's get some quirky actors - Bill Murray, Ed Norton, Bruce Willis, Frances McDormand, etc. - and put them in a quirky situation with boy scouts on a small island and then have a quirky narrator kind of tell us what's going to happen even though narrators usually tell us what did happen. Wouldn't that be totally quirky! In the quirkly named ""Moonrise Kingdom"" Wes Anderson tries to pull the ""New Girl"" television show's audience out of cute apartments and out to the flicks. There they find that the film presents some interesting dialog and plot turns as well as some decent performances particularly by the child actors. However, these charms are wrapped in circumstances somewhat over- engineered to be offbeat. The feeling of being manipulated limits the audience from fully enjoying the film although given the story can't fully sustain interest over its full length limits how much there is to enjoy. Also limiting the enjoyment are some highly uncomfortable scenes involving a twelve year old character being felt up in her underwear. People who find this discomforting (and everyone should feel uncomfortable with it) should avoid the film. In short, if M. Night Shayamalan didn't exist, Anderson would have an argument for being rated modern U.S. cinema's most overrated director.",2012
2,"I was genuinely looking forward to seeing this, especially as I hadn't previously seen a Wes Anderson film, which appeared a major gap in my experience. I have to say that I found it the most dull, unengaging film I have seen for some time, but I acknowledge the difficulty of being critical of a film that so many consider exceptionally good. It's interesting, though, to see that there are a relatively small number of comments here that articulate the same reservations that I had.",2012
9,It seems there's a divide between those who really enjoyed it and those who really did not. Very few in-betweens.,2013
1,"I was so let down by this movie.I had been really looking forward to this and had been harping on to my wife about it for weeks.When we got to see it she actually fell asleep watching it, to be fair i really don't blame her it has to be one of the most boring movies i have watched in quite some time.",2012
3,"I know making movie in general is a long tedious process and no offense to maker. I appreciate all the hard work it might have gone through.This movie is not mainstream,clearly aimed at oldies Westerners living in a small place and were Scout goers who enjoy being melancholic.Somebody who would love to run away when they were boring kid. I think rating is too high of 8 without any reason. Some funny bits but you have to be dumb,quirky and boring to watch it. Movie didn't make me think or connect with me even though I tried very hard.It is no way that great that it has to go to Oscars.Story too simple and humor too quirky. I can not believe the cast got ready to do this film especially Bruce Willis.The movie does capture the awkwardness of child growing to teenager but characters lacked emotions or major transformation.Maybe sometimes it is good to have simple quirky story but sorry not for me.",2012
7,"Moonrise Kingdom is charming, quirky, cute, affable, well-composed, sentimental, nostalgic and pragmatic; and I HATED IT. When it comes to Wes Anderson films, there are three guarantees: children will act like adults, girls will carry around suitcases, and parents will not understand - Moonrise Kingdom cashes in on the Anderson promises with much aplomb. If you have never seen a Wes Anderson film you might find Moonrise Kingdom to be magical and unique. If you have seen Bottle Rocket, Rushmore, The Royal Tennenbaums, Life Aquatic, and Darjeeling Limited, you will find Moonrise Kingdom to be a tired regurgitation of a one-trick-pony director who will forever try to recreate the popular and artistic success of The Royal Tennenbaums, his truly benchmark work. Anderson is a very creative artist, who freely steals from French New Wave and Italian Neo-surrealism, to craft highly choreographed and visually intricate films that specifically show the audience exactly what Anderson likes and how he likes to show these things; he is an artist who works exclusively in a personal space and so far hasn't compromised his personal artistic vision. And there is also the rub! Anderson is incapable of working outside his space; where he once filmed ""outside the box""...he now is trapped in this box and ironically appears no longer able to think outside that box - he is a hostage of the aesthetics and style that define him. A tale set in the 1965 about two pre-teens who fall in love and escape into a boy-scout fantasy of an adventure, Moonrise Kingdom, while displaying the very artistic template that made him a favorite of cinematophiles, is also incredibly lifeless, pretentious, contrived and frankly, poorly written. A stand-out cast featuring Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Bruce Willis, and Frances McDormand are wasted on underwritten cardboard cutout characters that are weighed down by hackneyed clichés and insipid dialog. I do give kudos to the main two leads - the children - they give the film its only signs of life; Kara Hayward would not look out of place in a Goddard or Fellini piece. While the story is mainly about unhappiness, disenfranchisement, and the ubiquitousness of love vs. duty, it also provides no real substance regarding these themes, meandering along until its trite conclusion. Moonrise Kingdom is a film that suffers the failure of style over substance - in so much as Wes Anderson's signature moves such as tracking from perfectly composed room to perfectly composed room, are now too obvious and no longer meld in the wholeness of the cinematic aesthetic, but instead point out, too glaringly, that you are watching a Wes Anderson film. There is a difference between suddenly seeing a Stanley Kubrick image and saying ""oh yeah, this must be a Kubrick film"" to watching a Wes Anderson film and throughout the entire film you are drubbed to oblivion with the fact that you are watching a Wes Anderson film. Within 10 minutes of the opening, I was tired of seeing what I was watching - it was so contrived and such a shameless display of idiosyncrasy that the film became a quest to find something new and fresh in it, and unfortunately there is none to be found. With a script that is full of humor but none of it funny, full of quirky characters but none of them interesting, and full of pretty visuals that add nothing to the story, Moonrise Kingdom seems like the death knell of the prototypical Wes Anderson film. But I doubt this will ever stop him - I applaud his artistic integrity and refusal to compromise with mainstream Hollywood, but ultimately he is becoming Quentin Tarantino - a one-note carnivalist forever trying to recreate the success of his early work (Reservoir Dogs is still by far Tarantino's best work and all subsequent films are the recyclage of Pulp Fiction, the film where QT blew his entire artistic wad, just like Anderson did with The Tennenbaums) by insisting on a personal style that is adored by many but offers nothing new to the medium through which the artist tries to communicate. Like Bill Murray's character, when told to stop feeling sorry for himself, I ask... ""why?""",2012
1,"I hope ""hipstery"" is a word because that would be the perfect adjective to describe this film. I will say that the cinematography, acting, and the overall look of the film were nice, but that doesn't make it worth watching. Now I'm not going to pull out that stupid argument that the audience is made up of pedophiles because I know some decent people who like this film. First of all, this film does not take place in any sort of reality that is relatable because the people take several things way more seriously than any sane person would in real life, all of the characters do and say things that no human being does or says (no they are not just being quirky), and apparently shock therapy is considered acceptable in this world. Also, this film isn't funny. Wes Anderson was clearly going for that awkward sort of humor, but it doesn't work because that sort of humor has to be relatable and this film takes place on some other planet. A great example of this kind of humor working is in the series ""Chobits"". Yes, Wes Anderson could not making a film as relatable as a show about a horny college kid who finds a sexy humanoid computer on the side of the road. The characters are boring. Seriously name one character with more than one personality trait. The whole thing just felt like a test to see if anyone would be brave enough to stand up to the majority and call this thing out for the pretentious waste of time that it is.",2014
3,"The movie starts out with a semi-omniscient character, who really fulfills no role other than to mark off the beginning and end of the film. He sets the mood--a fictional New Englandish island camp where a group of boys wearing Boy Scout-like uniforms cavort with their buffoonish adult leader. Everything here is overacted, farcical, and--if you ask me--pointless. We don't care a whit about the characters. It's a series of diorama shots to pose characters in implausible situations, with the coup de grace consisting of the boy and girl, who for obscure reasons abscond into a the wilderness of this island, to wander pointlessly towards a cove with some vaguely Indian-lore connection, where they then--needlessly in my opinion--undress to their underwear, despite being barely, if at all, into puberty, and engage in ""French"" kissing. The camera lingers more than a bit too long on the girl here. My date gasped in shock next to me, and one sensed a squirming throughout the mass of theatergoers. Don't see this movie. Save your money. Go for a walk to your own nearest lake, stream, or beach.",2012
1,"I went into this movie with high expectations; I assumed it would be charming, humorous, engaging. All those talented actors in it: Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Ed Norton, Bruce Willis, Tilda Swinton, Harvey Keitel...surely this must be a quirky, enjoyable movie. But oh my God, it was terrible (the person I saw the movie with thought so too).",2012
1,"I hated 'Bottle Rocket', hated 'Rushmore', hated 'The Royal Tennenbaums'. Surprise! I hated Moonrise Kingdom. Why do I keep watching Wes Anderson's movies? Because I keep hearing/reading all this great stuff about 'em. Bottle Rocket was the highly touted first Anderson film, so I watched that. I didn't get it. Rushmore got all these great reviews, and I didn't connect that it was made by the same guy that made Bottle Rocket, so that time I got tricked. Stinko. The praise for The Royal Tennenbaums was so over the top that I thought there must be something wrong with me for hating the two previous films, so I watched it and wanted to kill myself by the halfway point. I successfully avoided his next few films and then I got tricked again 'cause I didn't know Moonrise Kingdom was a Wes Anderson movie until the FIRST TWO MINUTES when it was unmistakable. ""OH NO, NOT AGAIN"" I thought. I don't understand why anyone likes this boring crap with 'quirky' dialog delivered in a monotone, long shots of nothing (someone's front yard with no one in the frame for a full minute, for example) and plots and situations with no basis in reality (but not in a good way). Of course, I despised 'Lost In Translation' and 'Safety Not Guaranteed' too. But I am an un-hip philistine and clearly I'll never develop the cultural palate to appreciate Wes Anderson's 'craft'. Watching this movie is torture. If you want to be entertained, avoid it like the plague. No more Wes Anderson for me. Ever again.",2012
1,I just can't fathom why this movie is getting such good reviews. Most likely the first and last Wes Anderson movie I'm seeing. There's nothing genuine or charming in this film. There's just this forced intentional quirkiness to this film that I can't stand. It just tries too hard to be quirky and cute and ends up feeling pretentious. The line between quirky and annoying can be very thin indeed and for me this movie crossed it by a mile.,2013
2,"From the first scene I knew this movie was going to bugggg me. But as an avid movie goer and fan of many of its stars I decided to stay stayed. The ONLY reason I'm glad I stayed is out of duty to my fellow movie going friends, who like me HATE movies where children speak with ridiculously stilted, staged, and fake adult dialogue. Yes, I get it that this movie is stylized but the dialogue and the way these kids speak is so unbelievable and annoying that it completely takes you out of the moment. And the story itself is completely mediocre - fellow movie goers - the emperor has NO CLOTHES. Really. It's even worse than Darjeeling Express. In that one at least there was hope that it could get better. Here's an analogy for what I thought it was like to sit through this film. Say you can't stand eggplant. And you get invited to someone's house to dinner. You've heard from other friends that the host is an excellent cook. So you look forward to this dinner. You arrive, you sit down at the dinner table and the first course arrives. It's an eggplant appetizer. You eat it because you're a good guest. As you're chewing you realize that every other course that will follow will be an eggplant dish. Eggplant soup, eggplant parmesan, eggplant salad, and eggplant ice-cream. There's NO WAY getting around it. One of the worst meals of all time. Plus, the memory of how awful the meal was lingers for a longgggg time. Yuck.",2012
4,I feel terrible writing this review. I've checked out other people's and have come to the conclusion they must see things I don't. The majority of reviews give Moonrise Kingdom 4-5 stars. Maybe I need to watch it again.,2014
10,"There's no live-action director whose movies are more like animated films than Wes Anderson. It's quite fitting that he ventured into stop- motion with ""The Fantastic Mr. Fox"", because the line between that and his live work is thinner than it seems. And never has that been more true than with his new effort, ""Moonrise Kingdom"".",2012
4,"I went to this movie on the recommendation of my 23 year old daughter. It was disappointing, to say the least. I don't know why she thought we would like this movie!",2012
10,"There can be little doubt that Cloud Atlas will become a classic that will be watched over and over again by its devoted followers, just like its predecessors by Stanley Kubrick and Ridley Scott. Despite the many questions I had in my mind when I left the theater and the moments during the film when I felt disappointed or confused, I knew this, and I have not stopped thinking about the movie and longing to be back in front of the screen.",2012
9,"""Cloud Atlas"" is nearly three hours in length, but I wasn't bored for a minute. The film alternates between six very different stories quite seamlessly, creating an exhilarating experience. It's part sci-fi, part historical drama, part love story, part comedy. Any number of things could have gone wrong with the film. All the different genres it brings together might have failed to coherently mesh. But they did, and it's something to see.",2012
8,I was lucky enough to get last-minute tickets for this film at the Toronto International Film Festival. The theatre was packed and we were thrilled to see it although we did not entirely know what to expect. I had read a part of the book but never found time to finish it.,2012
8,"I didn't find it to be a mess at all, and it was certainly the best thing the Wachowskis have ever done. I'm not sure how the directing duties were distributed, so I'll uniformly praise Tom Tykwer as well.",2012
10,"The last time I felt like this after seeing a movie was when I saw ""Inception"" on opening night. I realized I was seeming something that was different, creative, and classic.",2012
9,"Cloud Atlas is unlike its contemporaries at the multiplex. It tells a big story in an engaging, difficult fashion. It has big names and a big budget. But it also is thematically dense it wants to tell you something through plot, characters, dialogue and symbols. Cloud Atlas is also thankfully a very enjoyable film, much longer and denser than much of what is available today. ""Ambition"" defines this film. ",2012
9,My wife and I were able to see an advanced showing of Cloud Atlas last night at The Chicago International Film Festival. I will say that I was thrilled to see this movie from the moment I saw the initial trailer release. I am a huge fan of movies that are epic in nature and are rather daring by taking on the task of time lines that may span a millennia.,2012
8,"""Impressive"". That's the best description I could come up with after being asked by my brother and sister-in-law about my thoughts on Cloud Atlas immediately following the film's second-ever public screening we'd just attended. Not a very incisive assessment, I'll grant you, but my head was still spinning as I tried to make sense of what I'd just witnessed over the film's jam-packed two hour and forty three minute running time. This may be one the most ambitious and epic films I've ever seen, demanding rapt attention from viewers as they're taken on an odyssey that spans the globe over 500 years and hopscotches between numerous interwoven story lines that incorporates just about every film genre available, featuring actors playing several different roles each. Cloud Atlas is based on British author David Mitchell's best-selling 2004 novel and was a huge challenge for the filmmakers to adapt and finance (its estimated budget of over $100 million also makes it the most expensive independent film ever made). The architects of this beautifully twisted madness are directors/writers/producers Tom Tykwer (Run Lola Run) and The Matrix's Wachowski siblings, Andy and Lana (Lana was Larry until a gender transition that was completed about five years ago). The Wachowskis, notoriously press shy, were surprisingly on hand (along with Tykwer) to introduce the film's second screening the morning after its star-studded TIFF world premiere on September 8th at the Princess of Wales Theatre. ",2012
1,"A grandiose production and stellar cast doesn't help this overly ambitious mix come together in a coherent movie. The series of different stories isn't set up well in the beginning so it feels confusing for a while. Then when they sort of come together it isn't clever or convincing. Maybe this story was unfilmable. It just felt like a mix of bad movies shredded and mixed up together. It tries to have a common theme about standing up to oppression of some sort or other via corporate corruption, musical composition, the slave trade, science fiction etc but in the end it wasn't worth the effort.",2013
8,"This movie is a fusion of several genres (drama, adventure, sci-fi, comedy, romantic tragedy) as well as an attempt for an art-house cerebral movie to attain commercial blockbuster status. In my opinion it mostly succeeds, but finding a large mainstream audience is its biggest challenge to be met (at this point, before wide release).",2012
10,"Its films like this that make me still go to the cinema. Its films like this that makes you not give on Hollywood....just yet. You can go numb with the next so call blockbuster. Spiderman, Ironman, and the list goes on. Then when the returns start to go down, why not reboot the story from the beginning. Science Fiction, Westerns and Comedies rarely get Oscars, and Cloud Atlas is no exception. Doona Bae was really great in this film, all the actors were. Hugh Grant also really came out of his skin for this one. All the actors who we thought that had done what they could, were all great, i salute them all. Lets have more of this type of film, i don't just mean SF but good solid storyline films. Bravo",2014
1,"I'm going to buck the trend here and instead of extolling the virtues of this wonderful spiritual journey through time and space, I'm going to call it an undisciplined, self-indulgent, incoherent piece of claptrap. I really feel like this is a case of the Emperor's New Clothes. I'm standing up and saying the old guy is naked and he's ugly to boot. They said this was a book that couldn't be made into a movie. They were right. And it was pointless to try. What you were likely to get was... this! If you've read the book and liked it, then you might like the film too. But just remember, you are bring understanding and structure to what you see. If you haven't read the book and know little about it, this movie is likely to be a frustrating and incoherent mess to you. That was certainly my experience. So don't get suckered into going to see this godawful film ""cold."" Tom Hanks looked like he had a grand time being part of it. You won't.",2012
1,"Oh Hollywood, thank you for your use of music. It's the lube you use as a courtesy while you attempt to mentally rape me. It's the way you can make the emptiness seem profound. It's the way you make me feel as if I've learned a secret of life while being indoctrinated to the insidiousness of big oil, the heartlessness of corporations, the racism of Christianity, the crushing of the weak by the rich, the need for an anti-Capitalist revolution and the beauty of gay love. Your music is the cherry flavoring of the poison you have once again spoon fed me through my entertainment, a power you abuse without apology. The idea of Cloud Atlas, that people are bound through lifetimes, is one that I'm not sold on. Conversely, the common binding of the same stale ideology through reincarnations of cinema, sold with the power of music, that, you have once again demonstrated.",2013
1,I have seen the preview of this movie and was disappointed that Halle Berry was in this movie. She is a very boring actress who always plays a confident woman and in this movie she was not different than that. But Tom Hanks and Hugo Weaving made me watch this movie in the cinema. I did not know it would be a three hours hell.,2012
3,"I'm not sure what to say about this film. It was attempting to be all things to all men . . . literally, but failed so miserably I cannot conceive of how it is regarded highly by anyone who saw it. The only thing more embarrassing than the pacing, directing, editing and performances in this film was the make-up, which especially when Hugo Weaving appears dressed in drag as a middle aged nurse reminded me of a less convincing Mrs. Doubtfire. Hugo's transformation feels uncomfortable and half-hearted, designed for cheep laughs because the audience knows this is a man who is far more comfortable in a g-man suit and shades and not in knit-sweaters and comfortable shoes attempting to capture the nuances of Nurse Ratched. If it weren't for the fact that each story is edited together and connected by some goofy new-age reincarnation mumbo-jumbo it would amount to little more than a series of fairly pedestrian clichés in genre-fiction. The fact that the same 15 or so actors (about 2 or 3 of whom are better actors than this film allows) are jumbled between the plots makes the film even more difficult to enjoy. Imagine you're being served a 6-course meal, and for some reason the chef has decided to use the same 6 ingredients in every course . . . Including the ripe old cheese that was Tom Hanks in this film. The worst performance by far was turned in by Doona Bae, whose character seems to be built around 95% hairstyle, 2% skimpy skirts, 1% never having shoes on for some reason, 2% passively reciting her lines in a sort of monotone sigh. A scene where she is supposed to be giving a speech that will cause a revolution in her world sounds like it could have been read from a cue card by a shy 9 year old, this even after her character has only recently found out that her sisters have been getting ground up into juice boxes and fed to her. The scenes set in Neo-Seoul (apptly named since the Wachowskis directed this sequence) are nothing new. A futuristic dystopian cityscape has been done so many times since Blade Runner did it best 30 years ago that there's no wonder left in seeing them, especially since no-one has successfully improved on the original. There is of course plenty of martial arts, gun-fu, and even a Neo in Neo-Seoul, but the effects look rushed and unconvincing. At nearly 3 hours this film is a ponderous plodding mess that needs to be put out of its misery and converted in to a drinkable form for those who enjoyed it, so they can simply sit there and consume it without taking up theatre space from better films. They can put Deepak Chopra's name on the box to help sales.",2012
1,"First time I've ever written a review after at least 10 years as a member on IMDb. Yes, this movie is that bad. ",2012
1,"""Cloud Atlas"" was the longest three hours I've spent in a movie theater in a long, long time. Twice I had to hold myself back from walking out. The theme, if you can finally figure it out, is that love and relationships endure throughout time and the heroes or the spirits of the heroes keep showing up in different times in history. But rather show things in some sort of sequence, the movie cuts back and forth from time and place without any warning. You have to keep track of about a half dozen different stories, multiple characters played by the same actors and finally you just throw up your hands and give up. Even if you could figure out the storyline, there's nothing original about it. Oh, and bring a translation book since about 25% of the dialog is in some sort of pidgin-English invented for the movie.",2012
1,Now... forgive my hateful language but I am still recovering from the ridiculous boredom and anger that I experienced last night. I should start by saying that I spent the night trying to think of something good about this movie. I failed.,2012
10,"This is my all time favorite movie for many reasons, but one that I am always so passionate about is the content, the writing of this movie. Every line sounds like a poem, and touches you in some way. Very powerful! The acting is also very strong. The actors expressed their emotions and made me believe that they are really going through some sort of emotion. The visual effects are impressive, and the credits will surprise you with what you will come to find out. The story and just the meaning of it, still to this day, I think about and every time I watch it, I learn something new, which is really awesome. My favorite quote from the movie will definitely be: ""Our lives are not our own, past and present, from womb to tomb we are bound to others, and by each crime and every kindness, we birth our future"" !!! Genius!",2015
1,"I went into this movie without any idea about it.I just read Tom Tykwer did directing together with the Wachowskis. So this _must_ be a great film, right? No it is not. It was such a waste of time.",2012
10,"Before I start – this review is more of a study and thus is, by nature, full of spoilers. I'm worried that people might not appreciate the interconnectedness and message of the film and brush it off. I actually thought I was going to hate it going in, wasn't sure after almost two hours, then I realized I was in love. So I would suggest, if you plan to read on, see the movie first. One critic, Joe Morgenstern, from the Wall Street Journal spouts ""This would-be epic is beautifully photographed, elegantly crafted and adventurously cast. Unfortunately, though, it plays like a gargantuan trailer for a movie still to be made."" Morgenstern obviously did not understand the movie. How can he call something elegantly crafted and then claim it has poor structure ""gargantuan trailer"" in the same breath. Okay whatever, I don't need to diss critics – Cloud Atlas does that in one of the earliest scenes when an outlandish Tom Hanks, playing an lowlife writer who's just published an autobiographical work tosses a critic off of a building. I will say this though. Cloud Atlas is epic. It's more than epic. It's length and pacing are deliberate – you are supposed to be tired when watching it – this is a story that spans generations – if it was an hour and half it would not resonate. The beauty of the filmmaking is that these guys guys and gals get it. Zack Snyder – a talented artist – tried something similar with Sucker Punch, but ultimately failed big time. He focused too much on the visual crap. I loved the story of the girls in the home – but the action stuff was hokey, repetitive and trite. He thought we would eat it up, but the audience has seen it before. Then there's Cloud Atlas, we follow several story-lines ranging from comedy to drama to three days of the condor'esque paranoia, but when it comes to the action, effects, fantasy and hard sci-fi they do it lightly, sprinkling the massive work with seconds here and there. Just enough to leave us satisfied, but little enough to not overwhelm or undermine the complexity of this literature. I'm paraphrasing an incredibly powerful line from the end of the film here: ""You can't make a change you'll just be a single drop in an entire Ocean."" ""What is an Ocean but a countless pool of drops?"" This is the controlling idea for the movie: Can one man make a difference? Cloud Atlas believes so. Follow this single drop and watch how it ripples. Tom Hanks drops the critic off of the roof to his death. The death leads his publisher on a hilarious journey where he is wrongfully placed in a mental institution. The journey leads him to write an autobiographical novel in kind, but as he is a talented writer (obviously one who has been neglecting his talent) writes a good book. The book is turned into a movie where in the future a small clip of the movie incites a revolution which makes a person into a pseudo-Deity. This one bizzar drop – or act led a ripple which caused a revolution hundreds of years in the future. In other words, an single persons actions can have god-like effect. Then comes the theme of art or creating. Hank's character was writer. Cloud Atlas was a musical work. Letters between lovers. A Dairy and a video made by a rebel. A made-for-TV type movie based on a book. Each one of these creations of art pass through time connecting people and inspiring them to create ripples: In other words by creating even, the most insignificant works, people might find inspiration. Hell, I felt like writing this review just from seeing the movie. Maybe my review will lead somebody else to write a song, which will in turn ripples. The concept of re-incarnation. Each actor plays myriad parts over a vast amount of time and space. The argument of good vs. evil is explored here. The Hugo Weaving character is almost always evil in the physical sense – Hugh grant in the sense of conspiracy (Basically if your name starts with Hu – you are a bad guy). Keith David is a rebel. Halle Barry represents curiosity or investigation. These characters are archetypical and live within each of us – the most interesting is Tom Hanks who plays both good and bad characters. In his futuristic storyline – he has a personal devil (Weaving) that tells him to do bad things – but he does not! This is because inside us all we are capable of good or bad, it's the decisions we make that define us. In his future story-line he chooses to be good. Ironically V for Vandetta – also written by the Wachowsky brothers has this similar theme of standing up to the man. An incredibly simple scene sums up the entire film. In the comedic story-line, near the end, the old escapees are in a bar having a beer when the cross dressing Weaving (who made it big as a cross dresser in Pricilla Queen of the Desert) arrives to take them back to the oppressive old age home. The little old man, who barely speaks a word (the little voice) stands up and incites a riot. Just as Halle Barry reveals a report that ends a conspiracy or Doona Bae's viral video that incites an uprising that saves the lives of millions. The message here is a little voice can incite a thousand little voices. One singe drop. One single ripple. One perfect movie. If the message of Cloud Atlas is true then I hope that the creation of this film will inspire a million voices to make a million ripples. I for one am inspired. I will add to this review as I let the ripples spread in my mind. For now that's all I got.",2012
1,"It appears to me that all of the reviews on this movie are either 10/10 or 1/10. To all of those who boast this movie is ""The best movie ever created"" or ""a most inspiring masterpiece"", your reviews, to me, are incredibly naive. If you can actually decipher this movie then sure I suppose I can see where you get your ""masterpiece"" view. What's happening here though is that you are focusing purely on 'the story' and completely forgetting that it's a movie. You are finding some sort of poetry that makes sense to you and inspires you. Where you are naive is when you say 'the movie' is what is great. What is great, in reality, is the story. You would be just as well served by reading the book. The movie, however, is so horrible it's painful. If the movie was a Shakespearean play performed in Shakespearean times then I can understand how people could enjoy it. It honestly views as a play on a stage. The made up languages, accents, and ways of speaking are so outlandish it's impossible to follow, and horribly acted... The feeling of the movie is fake and incredibly laughable; especially when it's clear that the director was going for realism and suspense but failed so very horribly. If you are looking to be inspired and want to see what people are talking about with their 10/10 reviews then I would suggest you read the book. Or watch the movie, I don't care, but most of you will spend 3 hours of your life like I did wincing at the horribleness of this movie.",2013
6,"The fact that you are interested in watching this film and that it was even made should be heralded as a collective success, because Cloud Atlas is a thought provoking film. Your personal and collective philosophies will be challenged, and your emotions will be engaged. Each of the six stories address mankind's struggle against seemingly inexorable systems/oppressors, and resolve that love can help us overcome the worst hell. Cloud Atlas also requires that you have a super-trained memory because the six story lines are jumbled and unnaturally presented. I don't mind a thinking man's movie, just as long as my brain doesn't attempt to shut down after being exhausted by the editor's brutal film gymnastics.",2012
7,"In a world that is being overrun by reality TV, I really enjoyed this show. I saw a couple of billboards about it but didn't make it a point to watch but I just watched it On Demand about fifteen minutes ago and found it very entertaining. While it wasn't hysterically funny it had parts that I giggled and I'm certain that as the season progresses, the jokes will get funnier. I grew up when TGIF was popular. Shows like ""Family Matters"", ""Sabrina, The Teenage Witch"", ""Step By Step"", ""Full House"", and others shows came on. It was a great family time for my parents and my brother and I'm certain this is a great show for family.",2012
10,"I just love that show. Its fun, light and actors are amazing! Can not wait to see the new episodes. I've watched all the seasons over and over again and never get bored! Go on, guys! This show deserves 10 stars. I usually watch it anytime I'm at my home or just before bed, it's helping me to relax and it makes my day better with a dose of happiness and laugh.",2017
8,"I thought the first episode was very funny. I laughed the entire episode. The comedy reminds me of shows like Reba, 8 simple rules, some of ABC's TGIF shows, that 70s show and many more. I think all those shows are super funny and really good. This show isn't as good as the ones I just listed but that doesn't mean its not good. My nephew will be born soon so to me this is a fun show about people trying to take care of a baby and they don't know what to do. I can relate since I don't know much about taking care of a baby. I will enjoy this show while waiting for my nephew to be born and while helping take care of him after he is. I think you should watch an episode or 2 and see if you like it.",2012
10,"I love this show! It's one of my new favorites. It's a good family type sitcom, I watch it with my little brother all the time. These people saying it's not as funny as New Girl and Raising Hope, etc. Well this is Abc Family. Emphasis on the family! I mean I love New Girl, but that it is a show with a lot more expletives, a lot more of comedy having to do with sex. I think it's nice to see a show without all of that. You don't have to curse and talk about sex to be funny. And I love the cast!! They are all great. And of course Danny, so darn cute! He is my favorite =) ",2012

9,"This show is really quite funny. Very similar to Two Guys and a Girl but then throw in a baby. Baby Daddy has filled a void in the comedy genre that has been missing since shows like Friends and Will & Grace ended. Don't get me wrong I'm not saying this show is in the same league but I love that it meets the same criteria. Young singles living in New York who go about their day-to- day lives. Its comical, slightly stupid but totally realistic...well sort of : )",2014
8,A light hearted comedy that takes on parenthood from a young father's perspective. ,2014
10,"I love love love this show. It's set in NYC, and is one of the funniest shows out there. As a huge TV fan, I think this sitcom is what's needed in these times of political/economic instability. Although it has been running for 5 seasons now, each episode is like a breath of fresh air, promising twenty minutes of non-stop laughter to anyone who tunes in. ",2016
1,"So sorry ABC Family, this one is a BIG fail for me. It's a poorly executed mash-up of ""Raising Hope"" (baby daddy finds himself raising daughter) or ""New Girl"" (three guys and a girl are all best friends) without the quirky charm of either. The writing is juvenile and the jokes are stale. How often do we need to see an incompetent father wearing a gas mask while changing a diaper? Michael Keaton pretty much milked all the humor out of that little scenario in ""Mr. Mom"" in1983. And didn't Crystal Bernard in ""Wings"" and Courtney Cox in ""Friends"" pretty much cover the whole ""fat girl loses weight and is hot now"" theme? Personally, I'm soooo tired of this laziness in the industry. ",2012
6,This started well. The acting and timing was good. The writing was OK. The plot points were good. But now about halfway into the first season and it's fallen into a single sitcom cliché. The 'OMG' I'm in a pickle because of a white lie/miscommunication and/or wild assumption someone else made that I was unable to correct because of all the madcap shennanigans that resulted because I'm a coward and immature blah blah blah blah. Which is really pathetic and irritating. But it's got its moments. I don't see it going on much longer though. The story cant move forward because the characters are all emotionally retarded and it can't stay the same because that would be cripplingly dull. Let's see and hope for the best.,2014
10,"I just Loved it , I didn't laugh like this since friends . its funny , hilarious and all the actors are likable and funny love them all , its the next big comedy TV show after friends and I am sure their is a lot of future for this show ....I guarantee Emphasis on the family!

8,"I literally got hooked with the show the moment i watched the pilot episode(Which doesn't happen with me often) That baby by far is the cutest baby i've ever seen, She's like , you just want to hold her and cuddle her and she is the biggest factor in getting me hooked to the show. After Emma, my favorite character has to be ""Bonnie Wheeler"" I mean i love her , i wish i had a mom like that, LOL seriously the life would have been so much Fun..Her Performance is the best, i mean in the entire series She is the one who will make you laugh the most.. And that love triangle two brothers , one gal , childhood friends is kinda cliché but they have put it all together good enough to make you get stuck with your TV screen or your laptop for hours. I literally finished all 4 seasons in just one week, i know it's kinda crazy but it's worth it. In Conclusion its a Worth Watch. The Cutest Baby , Witty Mom, Hot Men and crazy love stories going around and new plots everyday - With all these you really don't wanna miss tons of fun and stomach jolting laughs.",2015
10,"I love this show! There was not a dull moment in it at all! Great cast, great laughs. I honestly can't be bored with with this show, its impossible. It is definitely something I will watch over and over again. Ben is honestly my favorite character on the show, he's witty, cocky, and sarcastic and go he's just a delight. I started this show thinking it wasn't going to be funny. ABC definitely a good thing going with this show!",2017
9,"Once you get into the show you may actually like it. It's about a really comedic family and their friends and seriously I have to say my favorite character is Bonnie. She is just BEYOND hilarious! Baby Daddy explores the lives of the main 5 people and you really fall in love with each character and their unique qualities. Honestly, you get comedy, hotness and super-cuteness in one show. What more do you want? I do have to say the show isn't addictive but most episodes are great. Not a fan of flashback episodes which they rarely use but have used once I believe. Similar to some other shows like Reba, the Big Bang Theory or the 70's show - in the sense that quite a few episodes are based indoors - though what I love about this show is that they use a variety of indoor settings. But honestly, Bonnie is the best. She makes the show LIVE. The show may not be the BEST comedic show but it deserves more credit than it's given, that's for sure.",2015

4,"Someone wanted to make this sitcom, but needed a pitch and made it about a single dad. The fact that this guy has a baby is rarely a part of the plot and they mostly work around it rather than including the baby thing.",2016
10,"I love this show!! Even after watching a few episodes of Raising Hope I fell in love with this show, possibly because I grew up watching Taj on Full House and in the many shows he was in in the 90's and 2000's and I am a Reba addict and love Melissa Peterman as an actress... To me it out shines Raising Hope just in the fact that the actors in Baby Daddy clearly have a connection off camera that shines through into the show and makes their entire kooky family thing work... No, the show isn't incredibly realistic, but I think that in today's world sometimes what people really need is an escape from reality... If you want to watch a show that is completely realistic then watch animal planet or the news... I do think that there are some very real aspects of the show as well, like Ben's struggle in deciding if he should sign the papers to give up Emma, and just that he is overall clueless when it comes to babies after he decides to keep Emma is very real of a young man with no younger brothers or sisters...",2013

7,Buddy cop movies have been losing their waves. The thing is that all the buddy cop movies after Rush Hour 1 have been either too dull to comprehend or just mildly interesting and could just pass as a movie you've seen just to mark the register that you've seen it.,2012

10,"I have never seen the original 21 Jump Street series so I can't compare. I had only watched the trailer and thought it looked alright, but wasn't planning on paying to see it. I received free advance screening passes to see it last night and I am so glad! It is honestly the funniest movie I've seen in a long time. I usually don't laugh out loud but this movie had me (and the rest of the audience) laughing at least every ten seconds.",2012
9,"21 Jump Street sounds like a terrible idea on paper: a big screen adaptation of an ABC TV series from the 80s. Was anyone really clamoring for that? Was there any reason to adapt that into a feature film in 2012? It sounds like just another example of Hollywood cashing in on an established franchise, akin to the decision to make a movie based on the board game Battleship. As it turns out 21 Jump Street is barely an adaptation, and it isn't just an excuse to capitalize on an old concept. Directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller, the team behind the brilliant and absurd Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, use the fact that nobody is too invested in the source material to their advantage, subverting all expectations for what a movie like this would be. The result is a smart, exciting and often hilarious action-comedy with real stakes and a surprising amount of heart.",2012
4,"Despite all the hype, I'm sad to report that 21 Jump Street, the new action comedy based on the 1987 TV series, just isn't very funny. My problem with it, is that Jonah Hill's 'Morton Schmidt' and Channing Tatum's 'Greg Jenko' are so over the top as cops, that you cannot take most of it very seriously at all.",2012
8,"The TV series of 21 Jump Street is always remembered as one of Johnny Depp's early performances. The concept is a bit interesting. At first glance, this movie looks like it's just another mediocre raucous comedy, but it turns out to be a clever one. It's quite a surprise. It stays loyal to its roots except it added some raunchiness and slapstick humor to the story. It's a new kind of 21 Jump Street that is much more fun.",2012
2,This movie seems to be confused as to whether it was supposed to be an action movie or a comedy and fails to achieve either. It isn't really very funny at all and it drags too much to be exciting. It has other problems as well. ,2012
7,"I too expected this to stink. Another buddy cop movie, starring Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, based on a lousy 80's television show - doesn't sound all that appealing.",2012
1,"The movie version of ""21 Jump Street"" was supposed to be a comedy, I guess. And I guess you would think it's funny if you love the same old jokes about penises over and over from beginning of the movie to the very end, literally.",2012
9,"On the surface, this movie looks like it would be somewhat mediocre. But it's actually pretty damn good. When you're not laughing your pants off (and believe me, you will be), you'll have no problem being just plain entertained by it's ability to just have fun. It does a great job of not only avoiding giant cliché's, but making fun of them in the process. Jonah Hill will have you laughing, and Channing Tatum actually did a good job in this movie.......not surprising seeing that the role called for him to be a douche bag. Which once again, is something to chuckle about. Towards the end, the movie does tend to drag on, but has no problem pulling you right back into it's fun. As far as comedies go, this is a pretty good way to start off 2012",2012
1,"An honest review. I can't understand why there are certain people who constantly hype this movie on the IMDb and criticise other better movies. I guess they must be paid to do so. Certainly seems plausible since I've now watched this crapfest. How bad is it? Do you remember the abysmal Ben Stiller butchering of Starsky and Hutch from a while back. 21 Jump Street is worse than that. Hardly surprising given that it stars Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum. I've only seen Tatum in one movie before and he was a wooden, dull, boring plank in that. He's no better in this. As a leading man he's even more of a charisma vacuum than Chris O'Donnell.",2012
1,"I liked the original show. I knew that this movie wouldn't be as good. I wasn't prepared for how horrible it was. If I had my own car with me I would have walked out. They took what was good about the show and threw it away. The movie is set in present day, over 20 years after the original show aired. It has Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum go undercover in a school to stop the flow of a new type of drug.",2012
1,"Just saw this with a friend. Saw the trailer, and thought that it looked a bit pointless, but gave it a chance anyway. The two main characters didn't have any chemistry, if you ask me. Nothing in the movie was realistic. It's annoying to see a movie with cops, who is that stupid. Ice Cube can't be taken seriously as a boss in a police stationen, with a street gangster attitude. If you like the series, don't watch this, something will happen that ruins the old classic, just avoid. I really don't get why so many people like this, maybe someone just voted 9-10, to trick others. If this is the future for other movies, I'm just watching my old movies again, gladly. Me and my friend don't agree on every movie, but we both think this was the worst this year. On to the next....",2012
1,I'll make this short and sweet as I'm not even sure IMDb will allow me to post a review of what may be seen as a minority opinion.,2012
9,"21 Jump Street is a brilliant movie with a well developed storyline and an outstanding comedic cast. It is filled with pure and sincere laughs from start to finish, certainly one of the funniest comedies I've seen in a long time, mostly made brilliant with the terrific chemistry between leads Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, you could tell that they got along very well on the set and enjoyed working together. The movie was also quite heartwarming at times and the characters developed surprisingly well, those are two significant things that make a movie great, as we symphatize with the characters more, but comedies like this usually don't bother with it, I was very impressed that this movie did. Absoluteky hilarious and very enjoyable, I would highly recommend 21 Jump Street to anyone looking for a good comedy ",2013
3,The target audience for this one seems to be high school boys. The well deserved R rating presents a challenge to get them into the theater.,2012
4,"After reading so many good reviews about this movie, I decided to check it out! I was really excited because everyone said it was hilarious. I was very disappointed from the beginning as all the funny scenes from the commercials that I had seen were in the first 2 mins of the movie. I will say, however, that the movie started off well and was quite funny, but once the two cops entered high school, it all went down hill! Most of the jokes were inappropriate and I'm not saying that inappropriate jokes aren't funny it's just that they were basically the same joke over and over again and it got old very quickly. The rest of the movie was rather slow and seemed to drag on in the middle and the end was just very predictable. Overall I would NOT recommend seeing this movie, unless you like wasting your money!",2012
1,"I watched the REAL 21 Jump Street and this is no where close to being called the same thing. 21 Jump Street was clean for teenagers to watch. It gave good advice to kids. It brought up subjects that kids dealt with. They did blow up cars or destroy a city. This should not have been called 21 Jump Street. Another thing mostly everyone in the REAL 21 Jump Street looked sexy and young. Neither the two guys in this show even looked their age. They both looked fat, ugly, annoying and pathetic. Also Hanson and Duggy would not have been killed at the end of the movie. They wouldn't have been that pathetic to look away while apprehending criminals. I think if someone stupid says this is good they need to go back and watch the REAL 21 Jump Street then can talk. Hanson and Duggy brought down kids in school with class and dignity not destruction and degrading ways. Why must they say the F word thru the entire movie, every second. I mean come on. This could have been a better movie if they had actually watched 21 Jumpstreet. Also those kids they had in school does not fit how kids are now. Kids are not into the tree hugging crap or two straps. Nah I'm sorry this movie was a HUGE disappointment to society. Don't WATCH",2012
1,"I know this movie made a ton of money....why? dunno...I've seen a lot of pretty bad movies in the last few years, but this was one of the WORST. Good God, why are movies like this made much less even thought of. A waste of money, time and talents, although there was not much talent in this piece of trash. Bad humor, inappropriate drug use, foul language not to mention an atroucious script. I tried to watch the whole thing hoping it might get better, but it got worse and time went on. I NEVER stop watching a movie no matter how bad. I stopped this before the end!!!! That's how bad it is. Where are all the good writers, producers, directors and actors? Oh, that's right...they're all dead!!! Seeing movies like this really makes one appreciate the wonderful films of the 40's, 50's and some of the 60's. If you want to watch movies with talent, story, structure and entertainment, see ALL ABOUT EVE; PEYTON PLACE; CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF; SOME CAME RUNNING; SOME LIKE IT HOT; A PLACE IN THE SUN; SOUND OF MUSIC; SINGIN' IN THE RAIN; THE BANDWAGON; just about any film starring the old pros like BETTE DAVIS; JOHN WAYNE; CHARLTON HESTON; MARILYN MONROE; HENRY FONDA; TYRONE POWER; even some of the newer stars like SANDRA BULLOCK; MICHELLE PHEIFFER; TOM HANKS; SALLY FIELD; yes, even JULIA ROBERTS!! To all producers: STOP MAKING FILMS LIKE THIS FILTH AND DEGREDATION. I'm no prude....but enough is enough!!! DON'T SEE THIS ONE.",2012
1,"I saw the advance screening of this movie and I don't understand why they took such an iconic series and turned it into trash. Tatum was lifeless and dull, and to be quite frank I don't think he commands an on screen presence to hold even a supporting role in a movie. He ruined GI Joe for me and countless fans and a few other movies I had expectations of. As for Jonah Hill his B grade comedy skills should be left out of Hollywood. They don't fit in this movie or this genre for that matter. Honestly, I wouldn't waste money watching this movie, its not worth even 30 minutes of your time. This was a failed attempt at capturing a series that Johnny Depp personified and its extremely sad that it was butchered into a cheap storyline with the sole intention of making money.",2012

1,Ugh. And I mean it. Who the heck sets out to make such a miserable film?,2012
10,"Like the rest of Ianucci's work, this is a fantastic political satire. The reflexive self-serving sycophancy, the arbitrary nature of power, the automatic deferral to the hidden powers behind the throne, the elevation of random dross above real issues (brilliantly lampooned in the pilot when the use of cornstarch forks in the White House becomes a stumbling block to setting up a clean jobs task force) are skillfully portrayed, showing how the dysfunction of the modern arena (especially the media's eye, usually passive but, as in the second episode, sometimes accompanied by a mouthful of vicious teeth) prevents the exercise of power for actual governmental function. None of the characters are perfectly likable, though all are well-played, but somehow the ensemble is endearing. Watch this if you want to see a sharp commentary on the drunken carousel that is politics.",2012
9,"I was surprised to see only one vote in for this hilarious new show,i always assumed HBO attracted a more discerning kind of watcher,ah well I'm sure word of mouth will do the trick.",2012
10,"Just saw the first episode of Veep and, if the rest of the series is as good as the opener, HBO has a brilliant series on its hands. Louis-Dreyfus delivers a performance reminiscent of her Elaine days; utilizing every ounce of her talent and pouring her entire body into each moment. It's easily her best work since Seinfeld, and that's no put down of her post Seinfeld work. It's a commentary on just how brilliant she was on that show.",2012
10,"Why are people voting on a show before it's aired? There is no way this deserves a 4.9; however, I'm sure it will go up as actual viewers chime in. I've seen the first episode and I'm hooked already.",2012
10,"I waited until after the sixth episode to review the show so it had time to germinate and really show the audience its potential before I made judgment. I liked the show from the start, mostly because I love The Thick of It and In the Loop. Now I love this show. ",2012
10,"For those who gave up after the first episode or two and are writing this off as 'not as good as The Thick Of it', you're doing yourself a great disservice. ",2012
10,"This is a great example of how comedy should be written. The humor is dry, witty, and fast paced. By the time one joke is sinking in the next one has already arrived & been delivered by an excellent cast that has the good sense to play it straight. I'm forced to give it a ten out of ten, the writers are brilliant & the cast knows how to handle the script.",2013
9,"Get the remote, find the rewind button and get ready. Not an episode has gone by where I didn't have to rewind because we missed dialogue over the laughter in the room. In some cases, we just have to re-watch scenes over again for sheer enjoyment of Julia's performance.",2012
9,"Initially started watching Veep being a huge fan of Julia Louis-Dreyfus. Season 1 , first few episodes were not so gripping but as the show progressed the plot as well as the comedy quotient heightened.Now cant wait for the next episode.The dialogues are witty and a lot of intelligent situational humor. You might a lot of expletives being used but thats what it more realistic.",2014
10,"Yes, another HBO serious, another Julia-Louis Dreyfus acting; and here you go; VEEP! ",2012
10,"When I first saw clips and tidbits of Veep, I didn't think it was funny. But, after sitting through the first episode, I immediately wanted to see more. The casts brilliantly turns an ephemeral of events into a shitstorm. It's even more hysterical with the realization that our politicians probably think and operate similar. ",2014
2,"I must admit I did once enjoy this show - Season 1 was pretty funny. Now, watching Season 3, the characters have begun to grate on me, like fingernails on a chalkboard. Especially that annoying weasel, Jonah Ryan. The show barely raises a chuckle, let alone a laugh out loud moment. I usually enjoy watching shows on US politics, and understand the context of this show. I think the show has gone down hill from Season 2. The characters have stayed 2 dimensional, rather than being developed into something more interesting, or even surprising. They remain stagnant and seem to just go through the motions. I can't watch this show any more. Sorry.",2014
1,"Why is it that American TV always manages to make a feeble version out of a caustic British political farce? Let me answer that one: because American TV networks are not allowed to criticize their politicians. That's why, in a nutshell.",2014

8,"As a previous user wrote, there's no way this series can, after just one episode, get a low rating; I too will give high marksfor the moment. Reviews can be updated and modified in time when circumstances dictate. I'll be revisiting this review in time of course, given I've watched the pilot only. In a recent interview of Julia Louis-Dreyfus by Piers Morgan, she was commenting about this new HBO series. She admitted there might be a slight slant pro the democratic point of view, but she readily also admitted that she had a bone to pick with all politicians, republicans and democrats.",2012
8,"Having not see Julia L. D. in anything since Seinfeld I must say this was a perfect role for her; growing up a billionaire she probably dealt with ""these type of people"" quite often and it has prepared her well to be one of them-at least act as if she was. But the reason I really enjoy Veep is for its atypical comedic direction. Leaving behind traditional (punchline,joke,pause,audience laughs), Veep simply embellishes-not by much either!- the ""shady"" world of politics.",2015
10,I didn't expect this to work as well as it does. Knowing the writer for British comedy such as the Thick of It and Alan Partridge - I thought the US version would lose some of its snap. However I shouldn't have worried. Armando Iannucci remained at the helm for this and it really works.,2014
1,"I watched three episodes waiting for it to get good. It is not funny, very shallow and a complete waste of resources. It centres around the vice president of the united states doing absolutely nothing important and being completely self obsessed with inane rubbish. There is no depth and the jokes if you can call them that are cringe-worthy. Julia Louis- Dreyfuss was quite funny in Seinfeld and sadly this show was not a good career move for her.",2014
10,"Not for everyone. But if you have a mind capable of following the incredible pace, sheer wit, intricacy, and pantheon of character interactions in this series, you will be hugely rewarded.",2013
3,I caught some episodes of Veep on HBO while eating Beefaroni out of a can in my room at the Vagabond Inn. The place smells badly of cigarette ash.,2014
6,"I tried following this show because like most HBO programs, it does not dumb down for the audience. I agree with everyone who says the situations effectively caricature the massive egotism and narcissism that is American politics. Julia Louis-Dreyfus needs to be a television fixture because she just nails comedic timing and facial gestures. The dialogue is super sharp. My problem with this show is that there is just too much of it. Lines just fly around relentlessly like bullets in an action film, and it really grates on me after about ten minutes. The characters just seem to never shut up to take a breath of oxygen. Also the younger characters are always portrayed as the most irritating intern types. In fact, most of the cast portray annoying and smarmy types except for the constantly exasperated title character.",2014
2,"Liking most of Julia's previous work, the new HBO production sounded really promising. Boy, what a disappointment 'Veep' turned out to be ... It's biggest problem is, it's really, really boring. Why doesn't it work? I'll try to find an answer here.",2012
4,"I know this has been debated to death, but couldn't help sharing my disappointed 2 cents. The only people who would think Veep is awesome are people who have either not seen or not understood ""The Thick of It"". I agree it is not bad. But even worse than ""The Office"" remake (which I actually like), the very obvious sitcom treatment is jarring on the Veep. The brilliance of TTOI lies in how it almost feels like a real documentary, and real ministers, and real office environment tackling real crisis in ways that end up looking funny to an outsider. But 'in the thick of it' (pun unintended), it is all serious business. ",2013
5,"I have a comedy void, and loving most things HBO, I turned to Veep to fill it. After season 1, I am disappointed. The entire show is filled with one-dimensional characters who are constantly talking and never moving. They talk in the office, they talk in the limo, they talk on the phone. Without seeing any of the stories take place, story lines are brought in an out on a whim. You will definitely laugh, but viewers do not need to listen to a 3-minute listing of inventive nicknames involving the phrase 'veep' or or the countless 'tall' jokes they crack about the white house intern. This is clearly farcical and over-the-top, and if this suits your mood, then this a good show to watch. For me, it's more appropriate for playing in the background while I do something else.",2014
10,"Okay, I'll be the first to admit that when the promos for this show first aired on Disney Channel, I wasn't interested. I hadn't particularly enjoyed Fish Hooks, and I figured Gravity Falls would be more of the same. I was so wrong. This show is full to bursting with fantastic and lovable characters, witty humor, great writing, beautiful animation, and mysteries, fantasy, and little Easter eggs around every corner. In addition, there are a few elements that could easily give me nightmares, but which, oddly enough, the kids I babysit find more hilarious than anything. Guess it's the age difference. If you haven't yet, you definitely need to give this show a shot. I know Gravity Falls fans from age two to fifty, and I'd recommend it to anyone.",2013
10,Very few shows have the capacity to entertain 8 and 10 year old girls a 13 year old boy and their 27 year old woman. Like the Shrek movies it has humor for youngsters and a stealthy adult humor. Definitely has elements from many cartoon predecessors and often times will ground a plot on a real life issue. My little cousins love it and when they found out I was watching gravity falls at home they flipped out. Now when I go visit we will sometimes watch on episode from the DVR. I literally can't stand most Disney programming but the style and creativity of this show caught my eye one day channel flipping. It is worth checking out and you will most likely be extremely surprised.,2013
9,"There are few things I hate more on television than the Disney Channel. This factory of mediocrity has churned out ""gems"" like The Suite Life with Zach and Cody and the unfortunately popular Hanna Montana. The Disney Channel is a place for Uncle Walt's successors to push talentless teens out in front of the world. Said teens get a few moments of fame and the Mouse gets another few million.",2013
10,"By far my current favorite cartoon! This show is really clever, mysterious, funny, and great! When I first saw commercials for this show I didn't think it'd be special, but I was for sure wrong! Once I started watching it I just could not stop. The characters act like real people and are relatable to. When you watch Gravity Falls you feel the suspense and mystery but will be laughing as well. The only thing I think I'd want different is more of it! But it takes time to make such a quality television show. Overall Gravity Falls is in my all time top 5 favorite television shows and I hope they continue making many more episodes soon.",2013
10,"I hate the Disney Channel and what it's become, however I watched this show, and was very entertained! It's not just the humor, but the mixture of surreal situations that connect with the story. Not to mention, THE CHARACTERS! They're all simply fun and the way they get along and interact with each other is great! The setting is pretty cool too, there's always the potential for something completely new and supernatural to occur. I've seen all the episodes so far (all 7) but for the time being, I will continue to keep up with the episodes, and altogether I'm just happy to see that there is still hope for the cartoons of today and the future cartoons.",2012

8,"Gravity Falls is set in a town in the middle of nowhere, focusing on Dipper and Mabel, solving the mysteries of Gravity Falls.",2012
10,"This show is really great, the writing is great, the characters are great, the humour is great, its the BEST written show storyline wise i have ever seen, the plot is so well thought out and so many secrets and codes to look for in every corner as part of the overall mystery. The characters are all very entertaining and funny, and the humour is very funny, quick, and breezy. The ONLY problems with the show is that it's rated tv-y7, it should really be rated p.g, if it were it would bring in the crowed it is more suited for. Some things in the show make me think ""wow they got away with that?! In this day and age?!"". Not only is there several jokes that would fit just as well in the simpsons, there's references to the simpsons too! Even a couple jokes that hint at pornography. The other problem is it airs on Disney. This is NOT a Disney show nor should it be treated like one if this show doesn't last long, its because its on Disney. It would be much suited to a p.g rating and on CN. Or at least if it was Disney, rated it p.g and air it late at night. Overall, a really really great well written show that is just not rated properly or on the right network. Do check it out though! Teens and adults will enjoy it.",2015
10,"Over the years, many shows have let me down in terms of storyline, humor, and originality. It seemed to me that every major children's network disappointed in all three aspects. I actually anticipated this show months before it even aired because, despite the fact that there wasn't much information available about it online, the premise sounded promising.",2012
10,"The plot is amazing, funny and mysterious. All the elements blend greatly. The characters are weird and lovable. The characters interact great together and I have been enjoying every minute of this show. The ciphers that the show offers are amazing and fun to solve they don't give away plot,at least not yet, so you don't need to decipher them, but personally I enjoy doing it. I enjoy everything about this show. There's never been any terrible jokes and no clichés in the plot which is always great. I recommend that you watch this show, but if you don't enjoy mystery in the plot, which I don't know why you wouldn't, or weird random humour, more understandable, then you probably won't enjoy this show as much as I have but it is still defiantly worth checking out.",2014
10,"Last Halloween, a friend of mine cosplayed as Dipper (The main protagonist aside from his twin sister Mable and their Grunkle Stan) from the show and told me it was worth a watch. Needless to say I got into it and enjoy it very much. Just finished the first season too! The character designs are sort of reminiscent of older cartoons and definitely some Ren & Stimpy influence thrown in there- big differently coloured noses, googly eyes and lanky bodies. The background artwork is surprisingly innovative and versatile. The characters, Grunkle Stan, Mable and Soos are amongst some of the best characters in the show. The writing is witty, humorous and even touching at times. Continuity plays a big responsibility in this show as characters will address past events and the show teaches good morals without being too preachy. Gravity Falls has a strange and mysterious history that plunges Dipper and Mable into all kinds of adventures and foibles. This show comes as ""recommended to watch"" by this old Saturday morning cartoon watching veteran! By the way, the writers of this show HATE teen pop stars :)",2013
10,I certainly love this show! its only one of the Disney shows i would watch i love the characters a lot! the plot actually makes sense than the other Disney shows i bet Walt would be proud every time it comes on it makes me smile,2013
9,"I say this as a child who watched Disney Channel during the period it brought its live-action properties to greater prominence: I never thought Disney Channel would have any good cartoons. I never grew up with Ducktales or the popular Saturday Morning lineup from the late 80s, and so when I watched the channel the only running cartoons were the likes of 'Kim Possible', 'Lilo and Stitch' and 'American Dragon'. The first two were decent cartoons, and while I didn't get into American Dragon much, the couple episodes I watched did feel action packed. Unfortunately, when it came to quality they couldn't compare to shows on channels like Cartoon Network. The characters and stories didn't leave much of an impact; a lot of it because the same archetypes and plots have been done better in other cartoons, but also because it never took that many risks.

10,"After reviewing a lot of mediocre shows,I decided to do a review on this amazing show.I really really REALLY LOVE this show.It's a perfect blend of comedy and mystery and some action.The characters are all lovable and have unique personalities(my favorite is mabel).The animation is gorgeous and the voice acting is not bad either.The jokes are SOOOOOOOOOOOOO HILARIOUS!!!!!!They're similar to the jokes in phineas and ferb,only funnier.The show also has some pop cultural references(something that seems to be absent in most kid's cartoons these days)So yes,this cartoon is not only my favorite modern cartoon,it's also my favorite cartoon of ALL TIME!!!!!Yes,I love it THAT much.If you haven't seen this show,then boy,have you missed out.Just watch an episode and I guarantee that you will love it.Sadly,Disney channel does not exactly love this show(as they put this show on a million hiatuses).I also heard that they are going to cancel this show and replace it with more stupid teen sitcoms.Well,if they do that,then I'll stop watching the channel for good.So bottom line:this show is really enjoyable and is a lot better than most of the cartoons that are airing now(in fact,I find it to be more enjoyable than adventure time,my little pony:friendship is magic and phineas and ferb)",2013
8,"This show is actually really good. It's not just some silly kids show that has vapid lowbrow jokes. Everything is thought out and has a purpose. It actually reminds me of the Disney show The Replacements but better. It has the same smart comedy style that is suitable for adults and children alike. I was initially surprised how clever this show is as the ads and synopsis don't really do it justice, but it is much better than you would expect.",2015
10,"In an age where Disney Channel seems to be stuck in a rut when it comes to making good shows, I've never seen, not only a cartoon, but a show in general as hilarious and ingeniously thought out as Gravity Falls. When I first saw the trailer, I honestly thought it looked pretty dumb, but once I actually gave it a chance, I was absolutely blown away! ",2015
9,"While I am 50 years old and WAY outside the target audience for this show, my 24 year-old daughter is hooked--so much so that she always insists that I watch ""Gravity Falls"" with her. And so this is how I came to see the show--and I assume most who have reviewed the show are much younger than I am!",2014
9,"First of all, the characters. Dipper Pines and Mabel Pines are an excellent example of what children are without overly sugar coating it. Mabel is a stereotype on preteen girls and achieves comedy by behaving like one. However, she is not an offense to the female gender/sex because she is not overly dependent on Dipper. Dipper is also a stereotype on what an everyman looks like but as a child. He is a kid but he is also mature. He has a crush on a girl and she is quite oblivious to it. He also is not offense which is hard to find nowadays The story is that Dipper and Mabel spend too much time indoors and their parents take them to Gravity Falls with their Gruncle Stan (Grand Uncle?) and notice that something weird is up with the town. Just like classic cartoons, Gravity Falls deals with a long-term conflict and short-term conflict. They are trying to figure out the mystery behind these books that are a manual to the paranormal things in the town. But with each episode the main characters get caught up with an antagonist or a random creature. There are gnomes, sea creatures, dinosaurs, time-travelers, bottomless pits, and many other things. There are also lots of references thrown in to video games and movies from the childhoods of adults which is why this would be great for adults. There is even a Street Fighter parody episode. In terms of production, the show looks amazing. There are not that many episodes, but that's because of release dates. The music is astounding. The intro sequence has great music. It is like the Game of Thrones intro but on the level of children's television. The animations is smooth and solid. The art has excellent shading, is curvy in its style, plays well with colors, etc. Basically, this cartoon is like a modern version of old cartoons that we all used to watch when we were children, which is good because it's the best of both worlds. Highly recommended to anyone.",2013
10,"So gravity falls is a series set in a small town Oregon called Gravtiy Falls. the premise of this is simple but the execution is beyond the cosmos itself. so the premise is that two kids Dipper and Mabel Pines move in with their uncles for the summer to find that this town is pretty much high on alien drugs. So the first episode of the show starts of quite slow with little character development (well since it's the first episode) but as of the next episode onwards each character began to be more fleshed out and their personalities become clear. For example in this episode Dipper Pines the protagonist are on a quest to show that he's not a weakling like everybody thought and it really relates to the audience since each and everyone of us HAS experience something similar that make us feel helpless. My favorite character by far is grunkle Stanley and grunkle Stanford. Both are absolutely amazing (honestly when I found out that J.K Simmons is doing Stanford's voice I screamed like a little girl) the two have honestly the most fleshed out characters since the two can only work side by side, they're a metaphor representing what the mystery twins could be, what Mabel and dipper could turn out in the future. And Stanley pines isn't just a money hungry cheat, his character is that his dad is not impress with him and doubt that he could make millions, like his brother Stanford. So grunkle Stan set out on a journey ultimately to just impress his father to win his love. The script of this movie is incredible, it's funny when it wanted to be and it hits ya at the heart when it wanted to. Ultimately it feels like a great adventure full of mysteries that people would go on the internet and make theories about, when a show managed to do that then you know that it's gotten everybody hooked on some legit Gravity Falls.The supporting cast are also great, for example this girl Wendy she isn't just another pretty or dumb teen who gets all the attention of the boys but she actually is a good person, not a gold digger or stuck up girl. Ultimately she values her best friends more than her boyfriends or regular friends, which is very nice. So all and all, at the end of the day, Gravity Falls is a blast with many twists that is sure to have jaws dropped everywhere. I recommend it very much.",2015
10,"You know, this show is really amazing. It pulled me in, it mystified me, it is just a true gem of cartooning (or animation if you wanna say that).",2014
10,"How can someone come up with a show so AMAZING?!The show is full of humor, ACTUAL humor, unlike all the other shows in Disney with terrible jokes, this show has way better jokes! Not only is it filled with humor, but it's full of suspense and mystery, and the story plots are really good. The show is filled with mysteries, codes and clues to unlock, making it fun to watch to find clues. It fills you with so much suspense! The characters are awesome too! Mabel, is bubbly, silly, funny and friendly. She is sensitive and full of humor, and she is the humor part of the show! Plus waddles is so cute! Dipper is more serious and a typical nerd. He fills you with suspense after he finds the book in the forest. Grunkle stan is greedy, but he fills you with the most suspense! As one code reavealed Stan is not what he seems, and I spend my time searching to find the truth about grunkle stan.Soos, is a gentle sensitive man working in the mystery shack.Although he acts dumb, he knows a lot about gravity falls, and actually is protecting the kids from finding out the truth, as he often distracts them while weird stuff is going on.The season finale is breathtaking! Bill cipher! Oh, I forgot to mention gideon, wendy and robbie! Gideon, a phony fortune teller, has book number 2, while dipper has book 3. he is evil,and wants all the books. he also has some secrets. Wendy is a cool, rebel teenager. and robbie is a rebel teenager, who is enemies with dipper because they both want to date wendy. I don't want to put anymore spoilers but just letting you know this show is amazing!!!",2013
10,"This show is sick. But i shall warn you that they are in the Illuminati Conspiracy. ever notice those pyramids, anyways search it up. Maybe thats why everyone likes it. KILLUMINATI! The humour is hilarious and its interesting there's a lot of puzzles you can solve. play the theme song backwards and theirs a message!",2013
9,"In a world where sitcoms rule the air, it seems unlikely that someone will step out of the box and be creative enough to make a well thought out, and funny animated show. Gravity Falls is one of those few shows, and boy is it good.",2013
10,"Went to an advance screening expecting your usual ""shy kid in high school learns to stick up for himself"" sort of feel-good drama. This movie is so much more than that - I was truly blown away by the mature themes and moving characters. Mental illness, sexual abuse, drugs and alcohol... I think the writer/screenwriter/director said it best in the Q+A after when he said it was a film that looked at the emotional aspects of that point in life without being sentimental. I really cared about these three teens - Charlie, Sam, and Patrick - and their story never felt cheesy. Just real, and moving, and touching. Go see this movie!",2012
10,I had the pleasure of seeing Perks Of Being A Wallflower at Arclight Cinemas in LA yesterday and it was definitely worth the one hour drive.,2012
10,"The Perks of Being a Wallflower is another story about a simple guy living in a cruel life of high school. The difference is he's not ought to save the day, wants to lose his virginity, seeking to be popular, or revenge on his bullies. The story is about a shy kid who wants to get along with people and can't wait to leave high school. Behind it is the genuine pain and emotion of the characters which makes it more than just another story about teenagers. Stephen Chbosky tells his own story on screen pretty well and the performances are quite excellent. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is often heartbreaking, charming, and wonderful.",2012
8,"Greetings again from the darkness. Brace for gushing. Last evening I attended a screening that included a fascinating Q&A with writer/director Stephen Chbosky. It reminded me of how personal and intimate and observant and incisive a well-made film can be. A well written script is so refreshing, and an exceptional script can be truly breath-taking. Mr. Chbosky takes the unusual step of directing his own screenplay based on his own novel (a 1999 bestseller), and he left me stunned and enthralled.",2012
10,"I absolutely loved this film - specifically the acting, music and even at times the cinematography. Steven Chbosky captured the spirit of the book and the characters magnificently - Ezra and Logan give exceptional performances that deserve major credit. Emma gives a strong performance as Sam - you can tell that she really understands the character, however she does struggle a bit with the American accent. Not to worry - she's in Bling Ring next year and will have improved by then, she does a great job of finding her ground and portraying a troubled yet lovable and wonderful teen, at times her actions speak much louder than her words. Logan is phenomenal at every aspect of Charlie - awkward, unsure, emotional, honest - he gives an amazing performance. Ezra is hilarious but not gimmicky, and can flip to a somber tone at a moment's notice and have everyone spellbound. Also great performances from Mae Whitman, Nina Dobrev and Johnny Simmons. The young cast is truly the heart of the film and are all really great. There is a lot of humour, emotion, honesty, everything it needed, and also an excellent soundtrack to back it up.",2012
9,"Saw this movie at TIFF and after watching the trailer was thinking I was going to enjoy this movie. Those expectations now are so very low, this movie is amazing. It speaks on many different levels of being a teenager, dealing with death, loneliness, and how awkward it can be trying to fit in. I haven't seen a move like this in a very long time and was very refreshing. The highlight of the film for me at least from a acting stand point is Ezra Miller really funny, but very heartfelt at the same time. Don't get me wrong the whole case is amazing (Emma Watson was perfect for this after HP) but Ezra really stands out. Stephen Chbosky really cared about this book, and it really shows in this film. Him Directing and writing his own book was a amazing idea. ",2012
10,"I just saw the movie at the Pgh premiere and it was amazing. I was hoping I wouldn't be disappointed because I loved the book so much. The movie is very true to the book. A few things have been omitted or changed but it doesn't change the mood of the story. I think the casting choices were spot on. Emma Watson has a scene in which she tears up and cries and it was amazing. I also appreciate how Chbosky made the parents thoughtful people, unlike most teen comedies. I am definitely going to see this movie again because there was so much to take in. Very well done.",2012
8,"The Perksas it were, was a bit of a marvel when discussing what teenagers have to contend with. Anyone that decides to see this film expecting a run of the mill high school drama or teenage angst tale will be pleasantly surprised at the depth with which this story delves. This adaptation of Stephen Chbosky's novel seemed to take the difficulties facing one young man embarking on his high school journey through one extreme situation after another. I could visualize a totally different version of this tale of misfit toys being played out where all is right with the world and Charlie (Logan Lerman) is the most popular freshman in school for the simple fact that all his friends are seniors. The immediate infatuation that Charlie had with Sam (Emma Watson) was no surprise, what did surprise me was the challenges that she and her step brother Patrick/Nothing (Ezra Miller) had to endure. Even I started to get annoyed as the school year progressed and the running 'Nothing' joke persisted. It's always surprising when a story focuses on well to do young people whose lives would be expected to mimic a fairytale. This story gives insight into the fact that some young people have the same if not even more struggles than others and having money can't really fix that. I found it interesting that there was no clear indication in the story as to the school year, even at graduation there was none of the typical 'Class of '92' or whatever to show how proud of their time graduates are. It may be that Mr. Chbosky wanted to steer clear of associating the story with a specific year, but it was obviously the early 90's when the primary mode of sharing and exchanging music was via cassette. I recall so very clearly the good old days when the 'mix tape' ruled. I have to say that I liked Emma Watson as an American teenager, she can cross the pond and put it down any time. Yes there were a few moments in her dialog that she sounded like Hermione, but this role did a great deal to paint her in a different and mature light. I am not drawn to tales of the human condition unless there is a deep truth to be gleaned from the story, so if I had to say the moral of the story is It would be 'you gotta have friends'. This story worked because of what the three key characters gained from getting to know each other. I give it a green light.",2012
4,"Although most reviewers on IMDb seem to be ecstatic about 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower', I don't think this film really stands out. To be honest, it didn't really move or impress me in any way. In my opinion it's a decent film, with some flaws, that could have been far better if it wasn't so mainstream. ",2013
10,"I saw the preview of this film and thought it was intriguing. I went to a screening last week and was totally BLOWN AWAY......this film has everything. I grew up in this era were the internet highway was just about to expload and I felt this film had EVERYTHING -great beginning = grabbed your attention, then acceptance, then the complex happened and you just didn't know where this film was going to go and then the film closure or was it? This has to be the BEST DRAMA/LOVE STORY ....coming of age I have seen. I would recommend this film to ANYONE....LOVED IT !!!!!! PLEASE go see this film. I feel due to lack of advertisement that it will be overlooked with other big blockbuster films but I totally related to this film and LOVED IT !!! I haven't even heard about this film until I was invited to a screening...saw the trailer and really wanted to see it but the trailer does not do it justice. If you are looking for something to do on a weekend ...get out of the heat..please see this film",2012
10,Spoiler Alert: There will be some spoilers in this review.,2012
6,"Mostly a trite and clichéd high school picture. Logan Lerman is miscast as a moody high school freshman (who looks like he' at least 16) who befriends a group of seniors (Ezra Miller, Emma Watson and Mae Whitman chief amongst them) who help him come out of his shell. That's not too unbelievable, but it becomes increasingly silly when Whitman becomes romantically involved with him, and Stone, on whom Lerman is crushing, would probably be game if she weren't already involved. This plays out like a fantasy, not reality. If you've ever been in a high school as an adult the maturity difference between freshmen and seniors - Hell, freshmen and sophomores - is hugely pronounced. Even among alterna-kids, no 18 year old girl is going to even think about dating a 14/15 year old. I couldn't quite get over that, but that's hardly the only flaw. Ezra Miller is definitely the stand-out. His homosexual character is a bit cliché, but I was happy that they actually weren't afraid to give him a sex life (though not graphic, I'm surprised it didn't land an R-rating because of it).",2012
6,"I'm not sure. I wanted to like this film, but I felt like I'd seen it all before elsewhere and better. The narrative is a little too crowded for it's own good - and no one gets full attention, though all deserve it. Unlike some, I think the script might have benefited from being set in a specific time and place (it is, 1990's Pittsburgh - but it is never stated). Like so much of this MTV book of the month selection, it tries to be universal instead of specific - even in it's characters. Joan Cussack is billed, but her role amounts to two scenes at the VERY end of the film, so (although she's no 'star' attraction) you spend most of the time thinking ""I thought Joan Cussack was in this?"" But I guess this film is meant for a generation who doesn't know Joan Cussack, is texting during the credits, and doesn't know Pittsburgh, and wasn't alive in 1990.",2012
4,"I viewed this film as something I've seen before. I'd go so far that I thought it was more something very typical for these kinds of movies and it was also very overstated. When this should be a character driven film, it's plot is way too controlling. ",2012
4,"I usually don't bother reviewing anything at IMDb that's already been reviewed a hundred times, but since the vast majority of reviews here are glowing, I thought I'd offer my two cents.",2012
4,"I wanted to like this movie. I read the book about a decade ago, while in my late teens, and the story resonated with me on several levels. I have been hoping (and praying as much as an atheist can pray) that the Hollydood commerce machine would not screw it up. Alas, in vain.",2013
10,"The biggest issue with this movie, I would have to admittedly say, is the fact that is such an underrated film. Not to say anything against Best Picture nominee, Silver Linings Playbooks, but I would myself place an Oscar nomination for The Perks of Being a Wallflower over SLP for a Best Picture nomination. That being said, let the review be underway A young and troubled freshman by the name of Charlie (Logan Lerman) attempts to make his way through high school and gain friends as he falls in love with Sam (Emma Watson) The story is definitely based off Steven Chbosky's novel which he writes and directs in this case. Normally, having the author of a book direct a film can often come out horrible as a reader's interpretation is completely different from a film director's. Also, a book must be structured and paced differently to that of a film and in most cases, an author directing a film would more so attempt to direct it like a film. It's not the case here, thankfully! The direction in this film is definitely marvellous and the way the characters were presented is truly fantastic. Having never read the book myself, I was almost immediately fascinated by the film and a while into the film, I knew I would love it. Despite only reaching a 100 minute run time, I would personally have loved the film to be another half hour longer.",2013

3,"Movies like this are a disservice to real life kids in actual high school today. No manic pixie dream girl (and her inclusive sidekick) really exist, certainly not in high school, and no unsuspecting nerd is going to be swept up into a whirlwind of acceptance and parties and love affairs. If this movie weren't about something people everywhere, throughout all time, ever didn't experience for themselves, maybe it would be entertaining. But they do. So it's just insultingly saccharine. This movie should be categorized under fantasy, it's certainly not relatable for kids, I think it only really serves as a guidebook for the MPDG wannabe's. IE: it's tripe. Thank goodness I didn't see this while I was actually in high school and actually struggling or this would have made me feel worse.",2014

It didn't have character development - it merely had characters to whom things happened. It didn't have any understanding of the drug culture. Or the music culture. Or the technology of the day - whichever day it really is set in. OK, it must be the 80s, 90s because of the cassettes. But as a group they dressed so unlike any teenagers I have ever seen anywhere.

It has all of the gross-out humor, sexual tension, and most importantly the heart. It doesn't break in any new ground, but gives great closure to all of the characters. The laughs also are spread out well from start until during the credits. In face, I think the first 3 minutes was the funniest I've ever seen in a movie. Even my wife who is just a casual fan laughed more at this movie than any other comedy I've taken her to. Stifler is back!!",2012

To this day it, and the two true sequels, remain some of favourite comedies. Sure, the American Pie 2 and American Pie: Wedding weren't as good as the first, but they all provided copious amounts of good-spirited yet raunchy and filthy laughs with characters you really liked. After a slew of shockingly bad direct-to-video sequels I was extremely excited to see the gang return for one final film in American Reunion. These are characters that have been gone from the screen far too long if you ask me, and their return, although not as good as the first, is still a hilarious trip down memory lane.",2012
7,"This is a true sequel: it expands on a previous story and makes it better. American Pie was never a great film and the many reincarnations of the same story did not do it good, but American Reunion almost fixes everything, giving it a true human dimension. In my opinion, it is this film that makes American Pie a classic. I just hope they don't turn it into another franchise. Let it rest, people! You got it right, don't mess with it.",2012
10,"American Pie was great. The sequels weren't so good. They were juvenile and fell flat because the humor was too obvious and dumb. But American Reunion was awesome! It had great believable storyline, character development, and well-placed physical humor like the original American Pie. It brought back the nostalgia of the high school years of the '90s while commenting on current times.",2012
8,"There is really not much to say here except that the return of Stifler and his posse....and just about every single memorable character from the first three films...are welcomed back with open arms in ""American Reunion."" After three absolutely sensational, immature-but-awesome comedies about sex, masturbation and fart jokes (somewhat ignoring the somewhat mediocre offshoots ""Band Camp,"" ""The Naked Mile,"" ""Beta House"" and ""The Look of Love""), I really did not know if, over a decade later, with all the actors and characters older, they could recapture the crude magic that made the first three instalments such comedy classic.",2012
7,"It was 1999 that American Pie launched what would be a series of teenage sex comedies, given a relatively cost effective formula loaded with nudity and toilet humour, that exploded at the box office and made everyone sit up to take note which of its cast members would go on to make it big. The film spawned two more films that would culminate in a wedding, before going direct to video in the many spin offs lie Band Camp, Naked Mile, Beta House and Book of Love that had very little links to the main characters. It's almost a decade already, and it's perhaps time to put those spin off films to rest, and bring back the original cast and their characters to the big screen in a logical reunion. And why not, given that the individual cast members never really made it to the big league, that coming together in a show of unity may rekindle memories of an audience who grew up with them from 1999's original, and in some ways provide one last shot in the arm for their individual careers.",2012
7,"My school was handing out tickets for a special screening for American Reunion tonight, I just got back from the screening. I was never a die hard fan of the American Pie series, but I've always found them to be quite enjoyable. I still feel the same way when I was watching this film. I'll be honest, I thought this one wasn't going to be any good and I thought it would be toned down, I'm glad to be wrong this time around. I'm not going to go much into the plot except that it's simply a reunion as all the characters are here to return, which it what you'd expect coming into this. It's just as sweet and crude as the previous three. Just like the other films, Seann William Scott is still the best part of the film. The rest of the cast did just as good as they did with the previous films. If you're a fan of the previous films, you'll still find something to enjoy. If you never were a fan, this isn't going to change your mind.",2012
4,WEEKLY MOVIE REVIEW: American REUNION,2012
5,"Really, it's important to say that I actually was a big fan of all of the previous American Pie movies but this latest establishment did absolutely nothing for me! ",2012
4,"Growing up, I was never interested in watching raunchy comedies and R rated movies. As I grew older however, they became more and more interesting to me. I am here to review this movie as nobody else can, seeing as how everyone I talked to has seen at least one other American Pie movie. This is a terribly done movie ONLY if you have not seen any of the others. Sitting through this I was bored to tears and hardly laughing at all. I am told that this is because I haven't seen the others and didn't understand the jokes since they all reference previous incidents. The first time the gang was together on screen, I thought that Stiffler was the antagonist, trying to tear everyone apart. In order for a movie to work, I think that you shouldn't have to see the other movies in a series in order to understand the current one. I think that they should all be original and introduce characters in their own way instead of relying on the audience to automatically understand them. That being said, everyone else I have talked to said it was just as good as the original, so if you have seen the other American Pies, go see this movie. If you are a ""Pie Virgin"" like myself, stay away.",2012
7,"The fourth installment in the American Pie theatrical series, 'American Reunion' is indeed A Funny Reunion! High on laughs & gags, this 2012 Box-Office Blockbuster is surely worth watching!",2013
1,Yeah. The title pretty much sums it.,2012
10,"You will laugh from beginning to end, and none of the laughter or jokes were forced. The movie just flowed perfectly. If you have seen any of the American Pies up to 3, you need to see this movie. It is worth it to go see it in theaters. I say this because once it hits DVD's it will not be the theatrical version and that is the one you want to see and even then, things are cut out. It's worth the money to go out and see it. I usually say a certain word is overused and overrated, but I am going to use the heck out of it. My tag line for any magazines or promos would read ""An Epic Return For An Epic Ending To An Epic Series.""",2012
8,"I would have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this film from beginning to end. Now, of course this is a bias opinion coming from an immense fan of the series. Although I just couldn't help but be impressed with how well the reunion turned out and here is exactly why I think this:",2013
1,"I don't understand how viewers would actually admire this film? Honestly, I think the series of American Pie went down hill soon after the spin offs are made. The original American Pie film (1999) was quite a good teenage film for it's time. It was a funny, serious and had a deemed message on the society areas within American high school. Although there was problems within the film itself, such as Christopher Klein's terrible acting, Jim's father being too involved in Jim's sexual life and as such areas are deemed to be unrealistic. Nevertheless, that film was quite good and I would given it a positive review. ",2013
4,"Seeing the crew back together was fun. The core characters are still likable, and the actors for the most part deliver. Stifler, like he's done throughout this franchise, nails some genuinely funny moments. The lack of an engaging story was the undoing here. The writers had so much to work with but, unlike the first film, create only a thud. The story lines concerning Oz-Heather and Kevin-Vicky are so much on the back-burner that they become nonexistent. More attention should have been devoted to them. Less on the tiresome plot of Jim and Michelle and their martial problems. ",2012
6,"Disregarding the countless straight-to-DVD duds that tenuously hailed themselves as ""sequels"", Reunion is the fourth instalment into the ultra-crude and hugely popular American Pie franchise. The cast are all 13 years older, but that adolescent giddiness they possessed back in 1999 when making the original (and by far the best) Pie thankfully hasn't been lost. It's a shame then that the material they're working with is half-baked. Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg's screenplay is lacklustre and derivative, relying on rehashed gags and goodwill toward the familiar characters to tickle the funny bone, rather than anything fresh or witty. Still, it's a major bonus to have basically everyone from the first movie return, including MILF guy #2 and the Sherminator, and veteran comedians Eugene Levy and Jennifer Coolidge are fantastic as Jim's Dad and Stifler's Mum (their end credits gag is the funniest of the film), so I couldn't help but watch this with a smile on my face.",2012

3,"The movie was OK..... 3/10. it was all too predictable. the cast was good, but the plot and subplots were dismal at best.",2012
1,"i really wanted to like this film but i left feeling very underwhelmed, i thought it could of been so much better, the jokes were cheap and just not funny in my opinion, it just felt to me like they were trying too hard to make this funny and a lot of the scenes were just re used scenes and plots we'd seen before. I know a lot of people may disagree with me but i thought this film could of been a hell of a lot better, they have a great cast of people and i'm sure the actors are talented enough but some of the interactions just seemed boring and forced, it felt like they were just doing this for the money and didn't really care about the characters or i could just be talking complete balls here, judge for yourselves but i certainly wouldn't choose to pay to see this movie again.",2012
10,"This is a great show. The writers do a great job of keeping the show from being predictable. The characters are unique and the attention to their individual dialogue is second to none. I love each of the characters they have developed, as they weave their way through the most interesting story lines. Just exceptional writing. Humorous, yet real. Fun, but never juvenile. And the acting? Second to none. Never over the top, always real and tangible and on character. Can not say enough about the lead actress. And so great to see such a strong feminine and yet humanly imperfect role model. The only issue I have is that I blow through the seasons too fast because there is no way to stop watching it. Watch it, and fall in love with all the characters.",2015
10,"I stumbled upon this show on Netflix and ended up having a Rita marathon weekend. I'm not usually a fan of subtitles, but it was very easy to follow and ever so enjoyable. The writers have provided a rich story with a complex but powerful woman as the main character. There are so many wonderful story lines and characters. The casting is right on. The show is a little edgy for US standards, which is a plus for me. It deals with real topics and I feel does an outstanding job.I especially enjoyed learning more about Denmark, a little about the school system(I know it is TV, but still a glimpse) and being introduced to Denmark TV. This show has me searching for more Danish programs. I can't wait for season 3. Please hurry up Netflix.",2015
10,"What a ride this show is! All the characters are perfectly cast and presented. Rita is obnoxious and she certainly must give off a whiff with all that smoking, but you definitely want her on your side, because really she is an example of a very decent human being. Hjordis is the most wonderfully vulnerable yet amazingly strong person you could wish to meet and the fact that she and Uffe can converse fluently in Elvish is a stroke of genius. This series has made me gasp in horror, giggle hysterically, cry in anger and sadness, laugh out loud at some of the antics, repulsed me in some scenes and warmed my heart in others. It is so well rounded and although the last episode is not a cliffhanger and could be a suitable end I do hope there will be more. Please let there be more....",2015
8,"I really enjoyed watching this series. I saw it first on Netflix. And then was able to get Season 2 elsewhere. The story is about Rita, as in the title, a parent of a dis-functional single parent family whose character is so well portrayed and played. I do not speak Danish so I relied on the sub- titles but that did not significantly detract me from the film enjoyment. Rita plays the role of a mother, a teacher and a outgoing sexually driven, outspoken individual whose life tribulations make a gripping tale. She is a just as kind and caring a teacher as she is hot headed and aggressive towards her dominant peers and challenges authority wherever she sees it to be unfair or irrational. Makes for a very entertaining and emotional drama.",2014
9,I truly enjoyed this show on Netflix and I didn't get enough. It is very different television than we have here in the U.S. They are more open and accepting of different lifestyles. Rita's character is very complex and I love her. She does so many things wrong and breaks rules in an effort to do the right thing for the school children. She is a teacher that truly cares for the kids she teaches but she isn't the best mother. This show reminds me of Nurse Jackie which is an excellent show on Showtime (Cable here in the US). I learned a little about their school system and their culture and it made me want to visit Denmark. After watching all 3 season I want to know if there will be more to come.,2015
10,"I just finished watching season 2 on Netflix (saw Season 1 last year). I'm eager to see Season 3. Why? Because not only do I totally enjoy watching it, but I so admire the writers and producers of it for bringing the world a show that has a truly progressive woman as the main character. And, not only that, but it is the first show that I've seen in a really long time in which the main character has an abortion. Probably because the show is Danish and not American; in the US no women on TV have abortions, even if they get pregnant through rape or incest. In the US, getting pregnant and having babies is celebrated to such an extreme degree on TV and in movies that it's not realistic. I've gotten tired of seeing characters get pregnant, not want to be, yet have the baby anyway. Not so on Rita. Yay! Women's right to choose is still alive on TV somewhere in the world. Not only that, but Rita has the confidence and chutzpah of no other character that I can remember who's not holding a gun. I celebrate a character who dares to fight bureaucracy and that which she doesn't believe in. Bravo, Rita!",2015
10,"I think we all can think about this one anarchist teacher we once had, at least I can. This series follows Rita a teacher who doesn't follow the rules and who's live is slowly falling further apart because of her behavior. Apart from family troubles she gets caught in quite a few affairs, oh the drama, which pretty much gives her the tittle of home wrecker.",2015
10,"I fell head over heels for this show. I watch and read a lot of UK and Scandinavian stuff and usually find it more interesting than US TV. I found ""Rita"" by accident and liked it immediately..possibly because I taught school for awhile and know what a hard job it is. I found the school issues totally plausible and loved Rita's determination to help her students, even to her own detriment. I binged watched this show to the point of dreaming about the characters. The lead actress is really good....I loved just watching her but liked the writing too. Seeing ""gay"" being handled as no big deal was very refreshing. I just finished season 3 today and am already in withdrawal. More! I need more! I am a 70 year old grandmother who likes good solid stories. I hope they add more seasons of this show.",2015
6,"Banal, boring and clichéd in its attempt to pull all the threads of Rita's history together. Tedious flashbacks and a feeble script. And hell, what happened to the lighting and makeup. How dig you manage to make the glorious Rita old, ugly and fat.",2018
9,"I appreciate this show, the dedication of choosing a teaching career amidst the lack of respect due by the parents & admin council is eye opening and disgraceful! However I find Rita's obvious calling to be a teacher plus her willing to fight the system on behalf of a failing system to be applauded! Especially, and maybe because, her personal sucks....She's lived her life by her sexuality & and led every relationship with her body, it's obvious appeal and sadly the need to be desired w/o intimacy, makes her endearing and you cheer for her to find that she, Rita, has value, and that she is enough, as is, to be loved solely & freely because when she doesn't feel threatened or that she has something to prove, and her guard is down, she radiates! I love is show and all the characters -- Please-please-please-bring it back for another three seasons!!! Binge watched and loved every minute except for the smoking -I sometimes swear I could smell it plus it's distracting and not really relevant to her story ....she must taste and smell like an ashtray! Just my opinion I know.... But bravo well done! Please do more!",2016
7,"I really had a great opinion about this show and found it funny how Americans find it very progressive :) But ok, let's say it touches some contemporary issues and the main character is just a human being, having a dark and good side.",2018
10,I am from Norway and me and my sisters have watched this series together. Season 1 was amazing and it really got us to love the series. Season 2 kept it quite good and we kept loving the characters we fell in love with. But at Season 3 we all agreed that it was getting worse and we got bored of some of the characters. When we found out Season 4 came out we didn't watch it at first but I wanted to see how it all went with the Characters I once fell in Love with. After watching the first episode I had a feeling this might get us back into the series we all Loved.,2018
8,"This show, which my wife (who is Danish) and I find highly entertaining bears a strong similarity to two American shows--Nurse Jackie and Homeland. Like Jackie, Rita is a troubled protagonist, good at her job, but struggling with a failed marriage, rebellious children, sexual incontinence, and irksome co-workers. Rita's sidekick Hjordis is a clone of Jackie's co-worker Zoe. Likewise, Rita's Mille Denesen bears strong physical resemblance to Homeland's Claire Danes (Carrie) as well as Carrie's sexual promiscuity.",2013
5,"Probably the thing I like most about this series, and the thing which attracted me to it in the first place, is the contrast it provides between it and anything that might appear on American TV. This show could NEVER appear on American TV, unless on one of the subscription channels like HBO, because it has such a casual and accepting attitude towards sex and sexuality and towards ""profanity."" These things don't bother me in the least, but I'm hardly the norm in America. If this series is any indication, then clearly the Danes, like other Europeans, are much more grown up in their attitudes towards sex and language. Not that that should surprise anyone.",2015
1,"I've watched all of the series and wanted to watch the last season, but I can't get over the fact that the protagonist (Rita) smokes around children! I had to stop watching in disgust. They show how she smokes in the school yard while engaging in conversation with small children! While being ever so cool... Are you serious?! It's the 21st century already. Haven't you heard of second hand smoking! Haven't you heard of all the detrimental effects it has on children. Unforgivable, careless, irresponsible. Also, a woman with that ass did not bear 3 children. Unrealistic.",2018
3,"If you are looking for a show about an adult who acts like a spoiled teenager, mediocre writing and implausible situations, this is the show for you. Otherwise, not so much. Rita would probably have come across as a ""really cool chick"" in 1975: cigarettes, swearing, lots of casual sex, etc. etc. Now she just seems (at best) rather immature. Like an insecure, socially awkward teenager, the show tries 'way too hard to be cool. And pretty much fails.",2018

 Synopsis 
 by George Kun 
""Rita"" is a contemporary provocative and clever Danish TV series, in 24 episodes over three seasons, offering countless laughs, chuckles, and surprises. 
In fact, it is about the journey of a spectacular and magic woman's ass, with such a seductive power that it gets constantly bulging eyes, dropping jaws, sweaty necks, pulsing breath, abundant salivation and mental distraction. On top of that, the mesmerized watchers following the provocatively moving and swaying miracle will also get to see the daylight through a tiny crack created by the combination of superbly shaped upper thighs and tight fitting jeans. True model ""fare"".
The target audience receptive to these charms is mostly lustful men, envious women and even children who can easily and naturally identify things that have eye-pleasing aesthetics.
This physical attribute does not simply float alone in the air, but is cleverly grafted on a real woman, who has plenty of other great attributes as well, even though her relationships, achievements, career moves, romances, victories, and setbacks revolve mainly around her main asset, her behind.
In all fairness, substantial credit is due to her other charming bodily possessions like her shaggy, bouncing, shoulder length ash-blonde hair and her eyes. Rita's eyes are not simply just beautiful but have a personality and a powerful message communication power, as well. She can look at you intensely and deeply, to evaluate if are worthy to fulfill her strong sexual impulse. Her gaze can be equally deadly in deciding how to verbally paralyze and annihilate you if you were stupid enough to challenge or insult her. Rita's eyes can also look at you and expertly inspect your soul and brain to fully understand how can she help you if she finds you are troubled. She certainly has the talent and the brains to do just that.
Rita is a Junior School teacher, in a very challenging environment, with a host of truly difficult challenges. From cultural and social integration of immigrant and refugee kids, to working with a helpless, clueless and at times immoral teaching 
staff, some backward and ignorant parents, promiscuous or messy sexual encounters with colleagues and even the father of a student, experimenting with homosexuality and finding the right way to come out of the closet at a very young age, the series has it all. The use of the school's washrooms, offices, and classrooms, or a backseat of a car used for spontaneous erotic romps, is at times shocking, but so much part or Rita's flawed but charming and definitely positive personality 
If you are expecting a light soap opera with simple, predictable, friendly, wholesome characters bicycling on the trails of a small prosperous and picturesque Nordic country, having ethnic breakfasts with tasteful coffee and Danish pastries, reading stories of Hans Christian Andersen, and consuming, for a change and not so secretly colorful pornography, you won't find much of that. We learn that the Danish social landscape is about as messy and with about the same amount of problems and stupid people, like anywhere else.
Still, the high entertainment value and the visual and listening pleasure of watching this spellbinding series comes mostly from Rita herself.
 The complete abandonment of any kind of political correctness comes as of breath of fresh air for the viewers who have been blushing for decades for the wrong reasons, dictated by a long, merciless and successful brainwashing.
Rita's heavy smoking, drinking, and her spontaneous sexual exuberance (""I'm very horny, I need to screw now"") is blended so credibly with her extraordinary love and support of her students, talent for teaching and pure compassion for humans in trouble.
Rita exits this long and intense episode of her life, by trading her career (not necessarily her future) for a totally unexpected but selfless cause, and she does it smiling, dignified and with her right arm and middle finger up, high up.
I loved the series, I loved Rita and I hope you will too.

7,"First of all: The acting is good. Especially the leading character does a great job. But the story lines just develop very slowly. Too slowly. And they could've deleted some scenes. But on the other hand.. it's enjoyable to watch and sometimes when you think a storyline closed, it suddenly pops up again a few episodes later. That makes things realistic. But I have to say: There are many series better than this one. Some characters we've seen before in other series. Such as Hjördis and Rosa. Although the scenes with Rita and Hjördis are quite funny. Just like the relationship between Rita and her youngest son. Anyway. Would I recommend it? I don't know. It depends on your taste. But if you're prepare to give it a go, then you should certainly watch at least three episodes, 'cause like I said.. the story lines develop pretty slowly and it only gets interesting after a few more episodes.",2015
8,"There is little doubt that this movie is not for everyone. If don't believe it just look at some of the reviews, lot's of 1's and lot's of 10's, me I am somewhere in the middle, (towards the 10 end). It is not for everyone because it is QUIRKY and I do mean quirky, with lesser talented actors I could well be one of the people giving it 1 star, however the acting was excellent. I have been big fan of Sam Rockwells, since the Green Mile and in Seven he is hilarious. Colin Farrell, was great and as usual Christopher Walken was superb. Mickey Rourke was originally cast in the Woody Harrelson part, and while he did a good job, I think the character might have been better suited to Mickey Roarke. There something about Woody playing a character that is way over the top, that feels like he's playing it way over the top, none the less he was still funny.",2013
10,"When I was driving to the theater, I was doubting my choice in Seven Psychopaths, because the trailer made it seem like so many films I'd seen before that looked edgy and wry, and showed so much promise in the previews yet fell short because of flat characters and muddled plots. This one, however, did not let me down.",2012
10,"My friends and I went to the San Diego film festival this past week and were fortunate enough to get into an early screening of Seven Psychopaths, by Martin McDonagh. The film was very satisfying to me personally, weaving an original story around rich characters. Story is something that I take into great consideration when viewing a film as it has lost a foothold in many films today. In terms of presentation, I felt this movie to be a combination of Guy Richie, Quentin Tarantino, and The Coen Brothers. It's hilarious, dark, gripping, precise, quirky, demented, gory, and British. The frequent narration and character introduction of the movie gives it a constantly evolving lure and makes you feel like you're sitting by a camp fire listening to something unfold. Even though their is a thick layer of narration and Peckinpah darkness, it's fun as hell, with the acting a huge aspect of that; if you want to experience a great story, that discovers a point to the whole mess these characters undertake, and have a blast at the same time, then go see this awesome movie!",2012
9,"I see the words ""cult classic"" in this movie's future. At the very least, I'll be adding this to my collection of movies such as Kick Ass, Pulp Fiction, Zombieland and Hot Fuzz that I love to watch over and over. ",2012
8,"Let's get the insane plot of Seven Psychopaths out of the way: Marty (Collin Farrell) is a struggling Irish screenwriter, who hopes to finish his screenplay for a film called ""Seven Psychopaths,"" while battling a case of writer's block and author-indecisiveness. His best friend is Billy (Sam Rockwell), a boisterous dog-thief, who usually winds up dictating Marty's life rather than helping him along in tough times. Hans (Christopher Walken) is Billy's best friend and partner in crime when it comes to dog-snatching. After both Hans and Billy steal an unpredictable crime boss's (Woody Harrelson) shih-ztu, it becomes a violent, relentless cat-and-mouse chase to get the pup back, and in the meantime, we get lengthy monologues between characters about the production of ""Seven Psychopaths"" and how Marty's inspiration begins to bubble when he starts considering the barrage of real psychopaths in his own life.",2012
10,"Seven Psychopaths is the best film to come out thus far this fall. Written and directed by Martin McDonagh (In Bruges), this movie is a one-two knock out with entertainment around every corner. The movie stars Colin Farrell, Sam Rockwell, Christopher Walken, and Woody Harrelson. Colin Farrell plays a writer struggling with a screen play called ""Seven Psychopaths."" His friend (Rockwell) is desperate to help write the screenplay. In the midst of all of this however, Rockwell also has a business on the side with Christopher Walken where they steal dogs, return them, and collect the reward money. Unfortunately, Rockwell and Walken make the mistake of stealing Woody Harrelson's dog; a psychopath who will stop at nothing to get his Shiatsu back.",2012
10,I watched this movie last week and I am still returning to re watch because it contains some of the most fascinating scenes I have ever watched. ,2013
9,"In the marketing for ""Seven Psychopaths,"" CBS Films wants you to count  the film's seven stars, but the one real psychopath (and I mean that in  most positive and endearing way possible) that matters is writer and  director Martin McDonagh, whose sophomore film and follow-up to ""In  Bruges"" is a cockeyed stroke of genius.  Sticking with what the marketing tells us, this is a film about a  couple dognappers who steal a mob boss's Shih Tzu and get their friend  and girlfriends wrapped up in the mess. What it doesn't tell you is  that Colin Farrell's character is a screenwriter working on a script  called ""Seven Psychopaths"" and all he has so far is the title. Oh, and  Farrell's character is named Marty.  If you can't tell where this is going, let's just say that ""Seven  Psychopaths"" is one of those films that reserves a special place for  movie junkies and cinephiles. Everyone will find a great deal to laugh  at (especially Sam Rockwell), but only a certain percentage will have a  gleeful appreciation for the meta-narrative at work.  Luckily, you don't have to identify as a film nerd to enjoy ""Seven  Psychopaths."" The film is by no means exclusive or inaccessible, it  just reaches another level of storytelling and maniacal brilliance if  you can make those connections. Beyond that layer, the film offers a  potent combination of semi-gratuitous violence, loony antics and some  stirring poignancy. Throw the meta layer back in, and you have the  equivalent of if Charlie Kaufman's ""Adaptation"" had been directed by  Guy Ritchie.  The film begins with Marty, an alcoholic writer, looking for  inspiration for his seven psychopaths. His first psychopath is inspired  by the Jack of Diamonds Killer, a guy running around Los Angeles  killing off mid-to-high-ranking mob men. Funny then, that his nutty  friend Billy (Rockwell) should happen to steal Bonny, the precious Shih  Tzu belonging to Charlie (Woody Harrelson), a sensitive yet unforgiving  mob boss. Charlie is able to track down Billy's partner, Hans  (Christopher Walken), and the trio is forced to make themselves scarce.  If you're still using the poster to count, then you're probably  wondering about the other three ""psychopaths."" Well, one is a true  psychopath, and that's Zachariah (Tom Waits), who responds to an add  that Billy put in the paper to try and help Marty find more  inspiration. Zachariah has a fascinating story of little consequence to  the film, about how he and his wife decades ago went on a serial killer  killing spree, gorily offing renowned American killers including  Zodiac. His wife left him, however, for getting too soft.  As for the ladies, they have actually no bearing on the movie at all.  Abbie Cornish and Olga Kurylenko amount to wasted talents, which is  only bothersome because of the marketing (or, I suppose, if you're a  hardcore feminist).  The four main players, however, give some of the best turns of their  careers. Rockwell has never been funnier playing his cocky persona.  Billy is so blissfully and purposefully ignorant of reality and never  lacks for surprises. Harrelson, having played many an oddball and many  a hard-ass, effectively blends both in Charlie. But it's Walken who has  one of his best roles in ages. Hans has all his marbles; he's even a  sweetheart, he just plays it abnormally cool in certain situations.  Whereas Marty overreacts to the danger this wild premise brings, Hans  handles it as if he expected it. Consequently, his humorous lines and  moments really cut the tension.  Somehow, McDonagh makes ""Seven Psychopaths"" completely hysterical and  off-the-wall crazy without completely shattering its believability. The  characters, though psychopaths each in their own way, are carefully  grounded and humanized. McDonagh gives them each something we can  connect to emotionally, something we can identify with, in spite of  their irrational quirks. The film occasionally takes some sharp turns  into eye-opening dramatic territory, but it doesn't result in the  jarring tonal nightmare you would expect that to yield from lesser  auteurs.  And there's still this whole other stratosphere that the film enters in  the screenplay within a screenplay context. Marty sets out at the  beginning to write a film about peace and love that features  psychopaths and violence, or something completely oxymoronic to that  affect, and McDonagh finds a way (in his interpretation), to make that  happen.  ""Seven Psychopaths"" seems likely to face a fate similar to ""In Bruges""   not a whole lot of renown amongst the general public, but heaps of  praise from those who ingest films on a regular basis. This one  definitely has more appeal (more stars, set in Los Angeles, etc.), but  both films have similar sensibilities. McDonagh has a real knack for  playing around with clichés and expectations. He twists them around  into something delightfully unexpected that despite seemingly outwardly  silly, is quite meaningful, shocking and doubtlessly entertaining.  ~Steven C",2012
8,"Depending on how you count, there really are seven psychopaths. Also depending on how you count, there could be more, which is a good thing because Marty – the lead character played by Colin Farrell not the screenwriter Martin McDonagh – can use as many as he can find.

It was not funny, it was not fun, it was miserable and I couldn't be paid to see it again. The only funny parts were the parts in the previews. Otherwise everything was awkward, gory, dumb, and depressing. There was nothing good about this movie!!! The plot would all over the place as was the dialog, the parts that were supposed to be funny were awkward and thrown in carelessly. The use of gore was over-done, uncomfortable, and sickening. It was a horrible depressing story, with a depressing ending nobody wants to see. Just because you put a bunch of good actors in doesn't mean it's gonna be good. Nice try!",2012

The ensemble cast gives it the feeling of a classic like Snatch, but this isn't an just an action film. It is more dramatic and you do feel for some of the characters. The movie does have some faults like some predictable plot points and the humor fails at some parts, but this shouldn't discourage you from watching the film. It is worth the price of the ticket. Seven Psychopaths is one of the better movies to come out this season. It doesn't disappoint. Its a great flick to go out with the guys.

Twenty years after the brilliant ""Reservoir Dogs"", it's a little late to produce another tired entry in the long parade of Tarantino knock-offs, but that's all ""Seven Psychopaths"" amounts to. In his plays McDonagh integrates corrosive humour, scintillating dialogue, brilliantly worked out plots, and pointed violence into a unforgettable whole; in this movie he throws all the sub-Tarantino genre clichés into a blender and throws the resulting mess onto the screen.

It is fresh, funny, and also a bit depressing at times. This is definitely not Sex and the City. That show was glamour and lightheartedness. This show, on the other hand, is about that bad experience that lots of people have coming out of college called ""the quarter life crisis"".",2012

1,"This is one of the most unimaginative pieces of trash I have ever had the misfortune to watch. I am usually pretty open in what I try - I'm not all too picky, and I am an open minded woman - but this, this... ugh. I don't even have the words. How do people get funding for stuff like this?",2013
7,"I hadn't been following the show yet but decided to get caught up since all the episodes were available on demand, and since they are nice and short it didn't take much time. ",2012
1,"Wow, what a f#$%ked up show. Life isn't easy and it's complicated and completely screwed up at times but this is not something to aspire to. All the people writing in saying I can relate or this is my life, than you seriously need to get your head on straight.",2015
1,I started watching the first season after reading how horrible this show was on other websites; I guess you could call it a morbid curiosity. I was pleasantly surprised and watched the entire first season. The show was quirky and I liked how Lena Dunham dared the audience to deal with her nude body that didn't fit conventional Hollywood norms.,2014
2,"I can see some minor appeal to this show and I won't challenge the taste of anyone who likes it. My girlfriend watches it regularly, though she can't articulate why.",2014
5,"Okay, this is going to be a long one, true fans of the show who understood what was special about Girls please bear with me.",2013
1,"When I first saw the trailer for this show it reminded me of a cheap version of Sex and The City. I ran out of shows to watch so out of pure boredom I decided to watch Girls on demand. I wish I could get my time back. Why Lena Dunham thinks everyone wants to see her naked body every few minutes is crazy to me?? Yeah I get the whole female empowerment issue but showing your gross body every episode is way too much. And in what real world would any attractive man want to have sex with someone so unattractive and I'm not just talking about her ill built physique. Her attitude alone is disgusting. Hannah is so self absorbed, narcissistic and egotistical that it's shamefully pathetic. In what world does someone like her dress so poorly and act so selfish and still is able to maintain a sexual relationship and any real friendships?? It doesn't happen like that. SO what makes this good television?? Nothing about it does. Even with all its awkwardness, it lacks heart and depth. I don't find entertainment in false relations between females. All they do is talk crap about each other then smile in each others face but still call each other friends. Everyone praises Lena Dunham on her writing of this show but in all reality the writing is junk, the acting is terrible (especially Lena's character Hannah), and the grotesque nudity and sex scenes are so uncomfortable that if any 20 something females say they can relate to this garbage then they really need to reevaluate their lives. And please tell me in what world does NYC always have sunny days and never a day of cold ass winter? Please cancel this joke of a show and make a show that is more realistic that empowers women by proving that not everyone has to be a supermodel to be confident. Please keep your clothes on Lena. In the show and on social media cause no one wants to see your naked body. Look up the word DECENCY and apply to all you do cause that is what real art possesses.",2015
7,"I am a straight (if that matters...) 30-something guy and I just watched the first five episodes of HBO's ""GIRLS"". So in a nutshell:",2012
1,"I admired Lena Dunham when she had her success with TINY FURNITURE - I didn't like the movie, but I was impressed she wrote,directed and starred in her little indie and got such amazing press for it. Good for her - but now with GIRLS - again, huge success but everything that left me cold in her film does the same with her HBO series. First off, I don't think Dunham is that good of an actress - she has this sing song manner that I find irritating and as a writer - I find that she is kind of lazy - it seems like when she gets stuck in writing a scene and doesn't know what to do - she'll just write in an awkward, humiliating sex scene and boom - wow - it's like life man! Yes, I know things like this happen in life and there are girls and boys like this in life, but that doesn't make it entertainment. There's also child rape and animal cruelty but that doesn't mean it should be a series - hey wait a minute!!! But seriously, Dunham seems to think she can just write something shocking or vulgar and pass it off as insight. The show is incredibly overrated to me - I find the emperor has no clothes - in fact,. when Dunham is nude she looks just like the emperor.",2013
1,"At first I hated this show. After watching the pilot i thought to myself why is this even airing? Especially on a network like HBO?! Then one day a marathon of the first season was on so I thought I could give it another shot. I sat down and watched the whole season. There were some episodes that I loved and the show started to grow on me. For a while I was even a fan and I couldn't wait for the next season. When season two came out I was so excited to check it out. After watching the first episode I was very disappointed but i kept on watching. Second episode aired, third episode aired and so on and it just kept being awful. The season ended and I just couldn't believe that there was not even one episode of the show that I loved. It's clear that the writers are suffering from a lack of inspiration. The main character Hanna became unbearably annoying and yet there's an episode that involves only her. It seems to me that the writers of this show had no idea what to do with their characters so they did all the wrong things and ruin everything good about them. At the end of season one there was so much potential but it all went down in season two. I am surprised that season 3 is announced and that this show still has a huge audience. I am sure that I will not give season 3 a shot and I hope that will be the last season as well.",2013
3,"I know it's only a show, but I am SO tired, bored in fact, with the laziness of writers and producers who, for the sake of entertainment (and advertising dollars)continue mining the same sad, vaguely misogynistic territory where women are laughable, but not funny. ",2013
1,"For people saying they love this show and that it funny i just don't get it..... this has got to be the worse show i have ever watched there is no just to the story apart for 20 somethings sleeping about and being weird..... i cant believe show like this got renewed for season 2 when they canceled season 2 of secret circle and season 3 o alphas these programs were million times better than this. I have seen a lot of bad TV shows, but Girls may in fact be the worst one of all time! The cast on this show has some of the worst acting I have ever seen on a TV.",2014
1,"First of all, this show is the dictionary definition of nepotism as most of the people involved are the offspring of the rich and connected. Go look it up. I guess the story pulls all the right strings about women and lesbians or whatever the hell else is fashionable because, man, has this project ever been pampered by the press who just can't get enough of it. I had enough after about ten minutes of the first episode when the protagonist is shell-shocked because her wealthy parents are cutting her off a few years after graduationfrom college! What horrible people! But I'm just an intern! Interns are all kids rich enough to not get paid, something I could never swing.",2017
1,Wow!,2016
6,"The first four or five episodes were hilarious...it was one of my favorite new shows on TV, and I totally understood why it was so well-received by critics. Then, inexplicably, it changed from ""a comedy with some dramatic parts"" to ""a drama with some comedic parts."" The characters became extremely unlikable...especially Hannah. The episode with Adam flipping out multiple times was one that I despised, and I would have stopped watching the show at that point, but there was only like 2-3 more episodes to go, so I thought I should hang in there. The last 2-3 episodes got a little bit better, but the wedding in the final episode was so ridiculous, which I guess might have been the point.",2012
10,"I'm twenty three. My girlfriends and I have real conversations like this. We're poor, fresh out of college, and headed toward grad school (hopefully.) What I'm getting at is this show is relevant to our lives, it's realistic and actually funny. Not all women were like Sex and the City and it's been said that Carrie's extravagant lifestyle was not realistic, this show is. I hate to compare the two but Girls blows SATC out of the water. This show is fresh, funny, and so true that it hurts. Lena Dunham is not only a phenomenal actress but the entire premise is so new and amazing that it's hard to believe she writes and directs each episode. Love is so far and I recommend it.",2012
1,"I had a professor who use to say ""there's no accounting for taste"". Some people are going to love things you hate, some are going to find things funny that you find stupid, and some are going to find things compelling and inspiring that you find boring at best and pure bullshit at worst. He was right. This show is nothing but a trashier, newer generation of Sex in the City where the characters are even more narcissistic (I never thought it possible) and less appealing. Some folks might like it and they're welcome to it. I know that I've liked shows over the years that most hated, so to each their own. That said, the show might be a little more appealing if the entire cast didn't always look like they needed a bath.",2014
2,This show is absolutely AWFUL! Read the other reviews - they indicate viewers kept going in hopes the show gets better. It doesn't.,2013
2,"I admire Lena Durham for all that she did with this program and her attempt to make something different, but it doesn't mean she deserves and HBO show about it. This is a copy of Sex and the City, but with more younger, annoying people. Durham's writing also reeks of Juno and after one time seeing that movie, that was enough. How many Hollywood movies are going to continue have this sort of writing? Self deprecation, gratuitous sex and a bad premise make this show a waste. There is nothing appealing about any of Durham's characters at all. They are annoying and ridiculous. The actors are annoying as well. HBO, please make something original and appealing!",2014
1,The show has all the excellent production quality HBO has to offer and the writing is perfect for it's niche audience. The show feeds the void left by a life time of neglect for learning. I would say the average fan has a complete lack of understanding of the world and has absolutely nothing to contribute to humanity except complaining and gossip. ,2013
6,"I actually liked Season 1 but it went downhill from there. Now I'm watching Season 5 and am appalled by how bad it is but at the same time very interested to understand why Lena Dunham feels she must have her character show her vagina to her supervisor, steal a poor guy's bike, hike a mountain in her bikini and generally show off her naked body in random moments even though the plot doesn't require it. The answer is simple. ",2016
10,"I personally LOVE this show. It's incredibly funny and extremely refreshing. It's quirky and almost every dialogue makes me smile like an idiot. The sex is also a lot more realistic than in other shows (Since most of the time sex can awful and unsatisfying, not earth-shattering like they portray on romantic movies and also, not everyone is built like a model.) ",2012
7,"I've got to admit I will miss Kyra Sedgwick, but for the past couple of years Mary McDonnell has been honing and refining her character of Captain Sharon Raydor so that we are familiar with her. As Sedgwick left the LAPD, McDonnell was poised to take over.",2012
10,Major Crimes has taken the already rich and developed characters of The Closer and endowed them with more back story and more emotional depth. I particularly like that every character is now up front and am thoroughly enjoying the interplay among the characters. The new teen character is helping to expose a tender side of Lt. Raydor. Kudos to all the actors for developing such dynamic and sympathetic portraits.,2012
7,"It's a great show, and though I regretted Ms Sedgwick's departure, Mary McDonnell does just as well - a thoughtful and individual portrayal that keeps you watching her. She gives a master class in how to play drama quietly and still grip. I like all the other characters, too, especially F. W. Bailey and Michael Paul Chan, who grow as the series progresses. Also - and this is essential - the stories and their solutions are of the highest quality. It is that rare combination of police procedural and humour, which gives the distinct impression that there people are real human beings, who not only work together but like one another. So I am a devoted fan - with just one problem. I would give it 8 or 9 if one vital change were made. That is:",2016
1,ha ha ha! I came here to check to see if maybe they've finally killed him off. ,2016
9,"I was thinking whether to watch or not MAJOR CRIMES, and yes, I am gonna watch! Traditionally, quite a lot of humor. And, as in first episodes of THE CLOSER - conflict between the department and the new boss. This time conflict is deeper, I believe, and the scene between Provenza and Raydor was very intense. I was always fond of cap. Raydor both because she is played by Mary McDonnell and because she is such a pain in the ass. She is so cold-blooded and determined sometimes, and than next moment you can see her confusion and doubts - as with Rusty storyline here, which I liked very much, and I'm looking forward to see, what happens next with the boy. ",2012
6,"My wife and I were big fans of The Closer so when it went off the air we gave Major Crimes a chance. I'm still not a huge fan of Mary MCDonnell but she's alright. The rest of the old cast that made it through to Major Crimes is just great, and the few additions are fine as well. But we just can't stand the Rusty character.",2017
7,"The Closer was one of the best shows ever on TV. For the first few seasons, every episode was riveting and most episodes had an unexpected twist or surprise ending. The final episodes of the series gradually and flawlessly morphed Captain Raydor, who had always been a thorn in Brenda Leigh's side, into a hero and set her up to be the lead of the Major Crimes squad. The best of the cast from The Closer was carried over as well, and it looked as if the spin off might turn out to be nearly as good, if not quite as good, as the original show. Unfortunately, while Major Crimes is pretty good, even very good at times, it falls short of its early promise, mostly because of the storyline involving Rusty, Capt. Raydor's teenage ward. Rusty comes across as unpleasant, rude, annoying, and petulant, and the writers have given him way too much screen time. In addition, his constant presence at the police station is not credible, as detectives do not have time to coddle a whiny teenager as the Major Crimes squad does, going so far as to help Rusty with his schoolwork and offer him advice at every turn. Without Rusty the series would undoubtedly be far better. But as another reviewer mentioned, he is designed to attract young viewers, and so we're probably stuck with him for the run of the series. Too bad.",2015
8,"I really enjoyed The Closer so I was really sad to hear about Kyra leaving. However, the spin-off, to me is very good. I think it has a totally different vibe and feel from the original show. I enjoy the supporting staff and like the continuation of their interactions. I'm a little surprised that there hasn't been more information regarding the politics behind the change from Brenda to Raydor. On the pilot it seemed to insinuate that the background of ""men's dominance and undermining tactics, would be continuing. However, I am glad not to see that at this point. I feel that took away from the premise of the show. I hope this show continues because I will certainly be a loyal fan.",2012
10,"Excellent plot.I like Captain Raydor.Now that we can see more of her inner world. Of course I miss Brenda,but Captain Raydor is showing us that the same job can be performed in different yet equally perfect way.Provenza's more responsible personality(in comparison to that in 'The Closer')is really in place according to new circumstances.On the whole, characters are very attractive,interesting,consistent with reality and these in 'The Closer'.There is not logical gaps between 'The Closer' and 'MAJOR CRIMES'and this is respect for us, for viewers.We like clever plots.I hope it will continue.Thank you for creating such a wonderful film.",2012
10,"I must say, I don't care what anybody else thinks, if you were a real fan of the Closer, then basically, whats the difference??? Gosh i was just so Happy to see my people again :D....OK, Brenda and Gab are missing but the rest are there back to there usual gig....whats up...at least we have still got them a while longer, I was so happy to hear the music, see the crime and watch Buzz getting all Buzzie again...good, good, good, no complaints from me...keep the fun coming ;)....Just don't know what else I want to write about 10 lines more ^^. Umm, I think the Captains good and it was really funny bringing ""Brenda's mess, back in"" how could anybody not like it, changes had to be made...else people would have sued more ^^",2012
9,"This spin-off is getting off to a great start. Most of Brenda's crew remains in Major Crimes and as to be expected doesn't warm up to Captain ""by the book"" Raydor, to say the least. I like the Raydor character and McDonnell's deadpan delivery style which often results in pithy and/or humorous observations. Like when she says to Provenza, in the second episode, something like ""Why don't you stay with the department until you find a job where everything is always fair."" This was not said sarcastically but ruefully for she has just been cheated out of a promotion - so no, life in the workplace is not always fair. McDonnell's character is so different from Sedgwick's - and this is good because they're both interesting. It's great that so many of the cast from The Closer moved over to the new show (Corey Reynolds' character didn't but Gabriel was my least favorite character so that's okay with me; besides given the attitude of a couple of the team members towards him, it would have made no sense to keep Gabriel in the Major Crimes department). I'm not too taken with the material witness kid yet but maybe he'll get a little less annoying. I liked the first episode of Major Crimes as much as I liked the first episode of The Closer. Here's hoping it will last as long.",2012
10,"Major Crimes is now half way through it's 1st season and i have to say...I'M hooked. I have always been a fan of Mary and was thrilled when she joined the Closer, When it was announced there would be a spin off after Kyra Sedwick decided to leave the show, ( YES she left, stop saying they got rid of her people).I was so excited to see how it would turn out, even though deep down i knew it would be a hit and it is better then i thought it would be. With most of the characters from the closer and new ones in the mix it has become an A grade show. . It has the same writers, directors and most of the actors from The Closer but It is it's own show with own storyline and direction. I love Rusty and Raydors relationship and i can't wait to know more. I love how The original Characters are getting more air time and power. Like Provenza Leading the Team when Raydor is not there. As well as seeing more of Raydor at a personal level. Simply put, i love all the relationships old and new ones that are forming, seeing more of the characters on a personal note and voicing themselves more. This show deserves a second season and beyond and i hope it does. I just hope people learn to let go Of the Closer and see this show for what it really is... Genius.",2012
7,"This review could have been a 10. Love the cast, love the dialogue, love the plots, but have absolutely no idea why this kid, Rusty, has figured so prominently in the series. He's neither a good actor, nor does he have any particular relevance to anything in the series. There is some concocted plot to kill him for some reason, he's begun to ride around with the squad and Raydor has assigned one of her detectives to teach him how to drive. Huh???????? He must be some executive's kid...I can think of no other reason to insert him into every episode. Thank God for the fast forward on my DVR. Not only is this kid thoroughly irritating, but he dumbs down what could be a top-notch show!",2014
8,"Every time I see Rusty, I turn my eyes away from the TV. This character is annoying. Not to mention that the idea of letting the boss's son hang around in the police station and stick his nose in the investigations is ridiculous. I don't think this character helps anything. It ruins the good show.",2017
3,"I like the show and many of the characters, but this Rusty thread has Taken over much of the program now and not just a good show. Go back to solving crimes instead of the mushy drama. Not entertaining at all. This show had some funny, light heart ed quips, but now this Rusty, who never smiles and life is just too much of a depressing drama has taken over.",2017
5,"THE CLOSER, let's be frank and give it credit, was a phenom.",2014
3,"This Rusty character totally ruins the show. First of all, he contributes NOTHING to the show, plus he sticks his nose in every investigation, running off and doing things that he wants to do. He has free roam because he's the captain's son, uses the police department's computers to do an illegal background search, runs and talks to the judge, and on and on. He's a SPOILED BRAT that has no business on this show. Get rid of him!!!!!!",2018
8,"It's good that Sharon's character has gone! She looked so fake all these while. and Rusty also has to go, he is so boring,. I love the rest of the characters! so entertaining. Please remain them! Can we get Brenda back?!",2018
1,"I don't want to chase a show for 6 weeks. Go back to the original format. Oh yeah, I agree lose Rusty!",2017
8,"Once again I stumbled onto this show by accident. Thank goodness. I find British police drama much more intense than the run of the mill American shows. This one is no exception. The acting is very convincing on all accounts. You think in the beginning how can this ""kid"" be a good main character. He then proves you very wrong and you see that his conviction to the case is what makes him compelling to watch. All the main players are only too human. The stories all have their own twists and turns, keeping you on your toes all the time. Making this show fascinating to watch. I admit there was an awful lot of binge watching as I couldn't leave the plot at the end of each episode. ",2016
10,"I watched series one last year, it was a good cop show, it came at things from a slightly different angle as it had the anti-corruption unit (internal affairs) as the 'good guys', so my rating was a solid 7.5... i enjoyed it enough to tune in to the second series which as i write this has one episode left to air and i have to say it has been TV at it's very best, from the opening few minutes it had me glued eagerly anticipating each weeks new developments, no spoilers here i only recommend you watch it for yourself to experience the shocks, the thrills and the suspense which it has in abundance, the casting of Keeley Hawes as DI Lindsay Denton was a masterstroke, the character is complex to say the least and she will trigger every emotion you have in your arsenal. Superb character acting, it really is. My revised rating overall is 9/10 but i'd give series two 10/10 after 5 of the 6 episodes...Well I thought I'd return for an update as I love this show so much now.. Needless to say season 2 finished as it had began.. sheer class and a great example of how good TV is right now.. Keeley Hawes we salute you.. now we are 1 ep into season 3 and Jed Mercurio has done it again the season opener quite literally blew me away I was so looking forward to it and it was like welcoming an old friend back into my life.. I can't wait to see where the show is taking me next",2014
9,"This is a review of both Season 1 & 2 of this wonderful British series. Although there is a different story line in each of the seasons, there is some continuity in the important characters: the actors Martin Compston, Adrian Dunbar and Vicki McClure, among others, appear in both seasons as the same characters. The story in each season deals with a conflict within a police department between the regular forces and the internal affairs or ""anti-corruption"" unit. Thematically, it is concerned with the moral ambiguities that arise when policemen investigate their own. I think this is one of the best British police procedurals that I have seen. The acting and the writing are uniformly excellent, and I hope it comes back for a third season.",2014
9,"In recent years, I have generally ""moved on"" from Poirot-Wallander type of series (usually 1 episode - 1 solved case) to more sophisticated and intertwined series where events take place in parallel and with flashbacks, and for full comprehension, one should watch all the episodes in sequence. It take more time and dedication, but there are more versatile characters and more complex situations where one can ponder on and over more intensely.",2015
10,"A very difficult show to review, overall I'd give Series 1 an 8/10, a very good show, strong characters, intrigue etc, however something happens in the second series and has continued through to the present day, since that very first episode of Series 2 (or in fairness Part 6 of the opening Series) Line of Duty has become the best thing on the box. The cast work together in a way that you don't often see in many shows, the degree of realism each of them injects makes the show feel very real. Dunbar, Compston, McClure, Parkinson etc are all utterly phenomenal, I think though, it was the performance of Keeley Hawes as Lindsay Denton that increased my interest in the show, she was utterly amazing.",2017
10,"I am a crime story lover and by far this is the best (even better than scandi crime Bridges and killing)I have ever seen. The characters are complex and specially Tandi N in series 3, is the most clever criminal police woman ever! I cant say enough to justify watching this best of the British film making, so 100% try",2017
8,"Being fan of British TV, i was hooked and couldn't stop this series. Has everything. Plot, dark and right timing. Great TV. The characters are natural and great acting from all of them. The suspense comes at right levels each episode and there is no way to stop until you find what will come next.",2013
9,"Line of duty is an exceptional police drama. My parents first found it on BBC2 which I find unusual by the fact that it is hidden amongst a less popular channel. Furthermore, the acting is brilliant and you'll be on the edge of your seat at the end of every episode - it is indeed one of the best police series I have watched yet. I suppose it could be down to the fact that it is very unique, in which the producers have found a huge gap within the crime genre of focusing upon AC12 which is an anti-corruption unit. This means that the entire series one and two focus upon entirely different story lines but withholds the same cast in both the first and second series. All I can say is it is a must-see and you will be hooked from the first episode - and I cannot wait till the third season!",2015
10,"I have been a huge fan of this show since season one and it's a rare feet when seasons 2 and 3 surpass the quality of the first. It draws you in and keeps you gripped never failing to end each episode on a cliffhanger which makes you desperate to see the next instalment. The cast is UK A list Aidrian DUnbar, Vicky Mclure, Martin Compson and Keely Hawes who gives the performance of her career in seasons 2 and 3. I'm not one to give plots away, but if your a fan of quality crime drama or Nordic noir I cannot recommend this show highly enough. Just one note of caution if your planning DVD series binge then expect some late nights!",2017
7,"Line of Duty is a Brit cop drama that focuses on the tense interplay, between the anti corruption units, within the UK Police and the officers, they are tasked with investigating. ",2016
9,"I am really Enjoying this series. There have not been many really smart police dramas no mater what country you compare this with though you will find that this is going to meet all other crime dramas head on and without trying to protect itself, or the sensibilities of the people. They are holding up a sign to the world with this show, and written in bold is that they know they are broken, but they have not been beaten. What you liked about The Wire, and The Shield, the truth, and heart of those shows is here, and shining like a beacon. You will be on board in the first episode, and surely you will want more. There have been a couple of nice shows like By Any Means lately, and deep dramas like Broadchurch, however what you get from Line of Duty is the real world and the real problems that can derail a really good image that is only ever the fragile image that people want to see. It's only when you dig down to the veins, and fibers that you really see the whole story.",2014
9,Although the initial ratings for this series were low I being interested in UK serials went ahead and watched it all. In the concluding evidence the story took an unexpected turn which makes one wonder. In fact it is quite scary if one thinks about it.,2012
7,"Last year the BBC brought us the superb, slightly strange police thriller 'The Shadow Line'; this year, the rather more conventional 'The Line of Duty' has aired. Aspects of this programme are quite good, although it never feels exactly fresh. Anti-corruption units, and undercover agents, have been on our screen before ('Between the Lines' - there's clearly something magnetic about that word 'line' and 'The Ghost Squad') - and some of the conspiracy elements seem both far fetched and perfunctory. Perhaps the greatest problem is that Lennie James' protagonist is a hard man to connect with: an almost-clean copper brought down by a bad friend, he remains a hard man to like, and while he appears to be driven by his own private sense of ethics, this moral code seems completely self-centred - he's torn when he fails to live up to his own expectations of himself, but it's hard to see why we should care. And the portrait of feral kids on the local housing estate seems both lazy, and again relatively loosely connected to the more serious crime in the background - if you're looking for the forensic detail of 'The Wire', you won't find it here. None of this actually makes for a bad series - it does all the standard things you expect a show of this sort to do reasonably well, but it doesn't add much you won't have seen before.",2012
8,"Covering similar territory to the BBC's great ""Between The Lines"" series of the 90's, this five part-series was essential viewing in our household. Gripping from the start, it never really let go and even if the conclusion was slightly unsatisfactory in my eyes, in that pretty much all the bad guys got away with it and justice wasn't seen to be done, but in terms of plotting and character development, it was riveting throughout.",2012
9,"This is a brilliant series. It is what I expect from the BBC, rather than the dreg they've been commissioning lately. The writing is tight and unrelenting in keeping upping the ante. It is complex, that is, we have great character arcs, as well as story arcs. The casting is so sublime that you would have to restrain yourself meeting those villains on the street and let's face it, drama is most often successful due to great villains. Shows like this, the tunnel, undercover, etc., make it nearly impossible to watch network TV in Amerika, where it is the same thing over and over again. The conclusion and arrest is telegraphed usually in the 1st five minutes. Kudos, and I don't give these freely, to the team that created this show. I look forward to more with baited breath. Bravo",2016
8,"In the last few years, Britain has produced many television programs that is pushing their American cousins to make better dramas. Line of Duty is no exception. This is a very good investigative crime drama that is centered on a team of anti-corruption officers investigating the country's most decorated detective, who may or may not be involved in criminal activity. The five episode season one, which is available only on Hulu, may not have quite the action of others (Sherlock, Whitechapel) but is not lacking in the suspense and keeps you guessing to both a whodunit, and whether or not a suppose good cop is dirty. I am not familiar with any of the actors, but it was clear they were all experienced and are very good at their job. Wonderfully done, and can't wait to watch season 2.",2014
2,"First of all, the acting was superb, but the story-line was hard to follow at times.",2017
10,"The show consists of four series and whilst relatively short, the writers certainly have packed a lot into each series. I loved this show and would class it as one of the best series I've ever seen. The characters are brilliant and its very clever how you are kept guessing the whole way through. Each episode ends on a shock discovery so you are desperate to flick straight to the next episode. Nothing is predictable which only adds to the experience.",2017

10,"This has been an amazing series so far (just finished season 3). It feels so real, so gritty. The characters are so nuanced and complex; they have good and bad sides to them, and you can't help but root for them at different points (both the 'bad' and 'good'). ",2017
9,"Line of Duty is a good, good, good series, and I am an aficionado of crime dramas. From the first season right up to this, the fourth, and I hope not final, season, this show has never disappointed me. I know this level of excellence is difficult to sustain, but I look forward to whatever Jed Mercurio and the other contributors come up with next.",2017
9,"I enjoyed Season 1 for the ""noir"" direction and the clever plot - very Scandinavian in tone as mentioned by others. Have not yet watched Season 2 so hope it's up to scratch.",2015
7,"Good as ever, but this time around I'm not sure if it has been deliberately dumbed-down for BBC1, John Strickland is just not as good a director as Douglas Mackinnon or if Jed Mercurio is deliberately trying to give us red herrings?",2017
10,"I'm not one to score full marks for anything but this was the most entertaining show I've ever watched. For a long time I was looking for something to fill the gap left by Spooks and though this isn't quite the same type of show, it didn't disappoint. Twists, turns, surprises, gripping story line and epic action. I never felt like I knew what the outcome was going to be until the very last episode of each season. Brilliant.",2017
9,"Another British Drama that shines like a star. I think, although in terms of genre, it is Crime Drama , it's very similar to the magnificent ""Wire"" They go in different directions, but still provide the same scale of quality. If we've never seen it, you're in luck. You can binge on the series. You will not be disappointed, wonderfully crafted and acted 9/10",2017

5,"Looper was enjoyable enough but I really can't understand all the praise. Maybe I expected too much of this film, but I was looking forward to a slick piece of speculative sci-fi that was thought- provoking, realistic and fairly deep. Instead, I got a lazily strung together generic action movie with a splash of time travel and super- powers.",2012
1,"!SPOILER ALERT! Contrary to the trailers, this is NOT a film about time travel. It IS a film about a telekinetic toddler (who is not in the trailers).",2012
3,"The near universal critical acclaim for 'Looper' is something I'm having a hard time fathoming. I suppose we haven't seen a great sci-fi thriller in such a long time, that as soon as a mediocre to average flick such as this one comes along, everyone is jumping on the bandwagon, practically calling it a masterpiece! ",2012
10,"I would have thought it doubtful that anyone could have anything new to add to the sci-fi sub category of time travel movies. After watching Looper yesterday, i'm happy to report that Rian Johnson has removed those doubts and given me hope that sci-fi in Hollywood can be more than just empty spectacle.",2012
8,"Sitting here the day after viewing Rian Johnson's Looper, parts of it are still falling in to place. Standing out amongst this years crop of mostly underwhelming sequels and comic book adaptations, Looper thunders onto the screen, showing, much like Inception did two years ago, that there is a place in 2012 for fresh material and just how good it can be when it's done right.",2012
1,"This story was written by someone who does not comprehend even the basics of time travel problems and paradoxes. It is a mystery why this chaos received so high grades. The plot in short: mafia from the future sends their assassination targets into the present to be disposed of; in the present there are killers, so called loopers (organized by a sadist from the future) who await their targets and kill them. Before or later, the looper receives a mission to kill his future self. Some of them fail to do so. And then the chase begins. First of all, the premise is pretty stupid, to use such advanced technology for such mundane goal. In the movie they have explained, that in the future it is impossible to get rid of someone without being tracked. It is, as it seems, far easier to build a time machine then to avoid tracking technology from a collapsed society. Then we have a pretty horrifying (and illogical) scene of punishment for a failed looper. His present self is mutilated and his future self loses his limbs one by one. This is wrong, all his wounds have been inflicted in the past so they would appear all at once in the future. And it is unresolved if his present self has been killed or will they keep him alive for the next few decades without his limbs, until he is sent into the present. Then we have our hero"", Joe who escapes his captors in the future, escapes his present looper-self and begins his search for a mysterious future mafia boss, the elusive Rainmaker"", who in the future has killed his wife. Then begins a Terminator-rip-off"". Terminator-Joe from the future does not have exact information about Rainmaker, only his date of birth and he manages to narrow his search to only three kids he will have to kill. He eliminates two targets and of course, his past self protects the real Rainmaker, the fact that it HAS TO BE KNOWN to his future self even before his trip to the past, because it is past, no matter when the audience has find out this. Then the Terminator-Joe eliminates his entire (ex-)gang and there is a showdown between him, his present-self and the Rainmaker-Kid. The situation is resolved when the present Joe kills himself and the Terminator-Joe disappears. Which would set in motion time traveling paradox: Terminator Joe does not exist so he cant be sent into the past and all his actions would be reversed. But no, all his actions in the movie remain. The Rainmaker-kid survives and he will grow up not to be mafia boss but exemplary member of future society. The end. Oh, and this Rainmaker-kid has a Carrie-like telekinetic abilities, which has nothing to do with a plot and is complete superficial. As for the pacing of the movie, it is horrible. We begin with a bang (literary), then a movie comes to a halt and we have an hour or so pure boredom (or character development""). Then we have a final shoot out. All in all a very bad experience, caused by a fanboy-hype. If you want to see Bruce Willis travel through time, watch 12 Monkeys"", a far superior movie in every sense.",2012
9,"I've been reading many reviews and the discussion boards on this site, and after just coming back from enjoying it, I was very disappointing to see so many negative reviews and comments. I'm definitely going to be responding to some comments in the discussion boards from some specific details of the movie, but for now I will just write a review. And a positive review since there is so many haters out there.",2012
8,i always approach a film especially when it is classified as scifi with liberal suspension of disbelief. because it is only through that that i was able to appreciate such scifi gems as Stargate and Fifth Element and many other that were otherwise written off by these so-called critics.,2012
1,"Rian Johnson fiction film (as it contains no science) Looper should be the line in the sand to say enough. Cinema going has turned into such a trite state that a film like this could be critically acclaimed and mass released. In the day and age of no heart films, torture porn and saccharine dramas we again have to endure the waste of time, resources and column space that a films like this garners. At a time when other worthwhile films slip into obscurity of small openings and DVD bargain bins.",2012
1,"The whole premise of this story was flawed from the beginning. For SciFi fans time travel is what its all about. Its meant to be intriguing and full of conundrums that most importantly, some how make sense. All the best time travel movies have a consistency that holds the idea together. This is precisely what Loopers does not have. There where so many holes in the plot that it became impossible to go with it. If your going to beam someone to the past to be killed why do you need a Looper. why not beam them straight to the furnaces. And if you have to use a Looper why rely on him to kill himself - let someone else do it. Seriously this was just a few of the canyon like proportions of the gaps in the plot of this flop. If Bruce was not in this i would have walked way before the end. I was fooled. You don't have to be.",2012
9,"Looper is a film that goes to extraordinary lengths to leave every base covered in its quest to avoid plot holes and inconsistencies and in my mind it deals with the problems associated with time travel very well. One thing I liked is that the older Joe is aware of everything the younger Joe is about to do which gives him an edge if they were to do battle. I also liked that the older Joe in true Bruce Willis style bypasses the whole idea of trying to work out how and why what is happening is happening by saying he can't be bothered to work it all out. As well as the older Joe having the advantage of memory over the younger Joe, the younger Joe in turn has his own advantages which become apparent. There were several times when I thought I'd worked out what was going to happen or what a particular character's arc was going to be but the film cleverly manipulates its audience, leading them down alleyways only to jump out at them from behind and spin them around. There is a nice early twist which gave me a smile and plenty more to keep you guessing right the way to the end. In the end it turns out that time travel plays second fiddle to another phenomenon which I was pleased by as there was no mention of this in the trailer which I've been trying to avoid for several weeks. The plot is multifaceted with each character having their own reasons for being where they are, when they are and doing what they are doing. It is a dense plot which explores several different ideas and concepts both personal and scientific.",2012
10,"Looper seems like it's inspired by Philip K. Dick's several works. It's a Sci-Fi story that is set in the future with a quite interesting concept. The ads shows this as a typical nonstop action film. Surprisingly, it's much better than anyone would expect. It's actually a mind blowing film that tells an unpredictable story and has a great amount of thrills. The performances are strong and the directing is solid. Unlike most modern Sci-Fi films they depend on the action and the explosions. Looper is all about letting the audience intrigue all the way on the concept.",2012
5,"The premise for this film is fantastic, the cast appears great, and its a movie that wants to be seen. However, it is a major disappointment. The whole concept of hit men and time-travel is intriguing- and the concept of your future self being the target, even more so, but this, in truth, is not what the film ends up being about. In a Terminator esque manner Bruce Willis turns his antics in the past to a 'save the future' kill quest wanting to destroy a future-crushing ""rainmaker"" (whom we know very little about and have little incentive to want killed) whilst he is still a child. The aforementioned has 'TK'- the films terms for Telekentic powers- and this is barely covered and feels like one idea too far, almost an add on that is ultimately crucial to the narrative but is not presented to us enough. In all the film leaves you dissatisfied, feels clunky, and disappointing as on paper it could have been so much better..",2012
10,"To begin, Looper is a sci-fi film set in the future, dealing with the implications of time-travel, although it is very much a film about the past. The film is all about the past, how it affects the present and the future and how it drives people with the majority of the film building characters and establishing plot.",2012
1,The ending makes the whole experience a huge flop and major waste of money.,2012
4,Plenty of reviews here go into detail on this movie but I thought I'd add my two cents.,2013
1,"What is wrong with the critics these days? Either they've been paid well enough to keep their mouths shut of how lame this film is or they are just a bunch of quacks. Honestly, I can't imagine how deceiving Hollywood has become with flashy trailers. ",2012
1,"""Looper"" qualifies as a sordid science fiction thriller about time travel with an awful ending. Stir a little H.G. Wells in with some Stephen King and add a pinch of ""The Sopranos,"" and you've got the basics of ""Brick"" director Rian Johnson's contrived, unconvincing chronicle. Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are cast as one in the same character in this disappointing actioneer that pits them against each other with a no-win outcome. Furthermore, both protagonists emerge as more anti-heroic than heroic. If you dismiss the fact these talented thespians bear scant resemblance to each other, you must still consider the scarcity of information about a distant future as well as a warped premise. These shortcomings constitute the chief flaws in this imaginative but predictable sci-fi saga that unfolds in an erratic manner, lacks quotable dialogue, and features one character with no qualms about shooting innocent adolescents. By the time this uninspired, R-rated, 118-minute, spectacle has worn out its welcome; you have no reason to care about anybody, including an obnoxious telekinetic tyke who doesn't know when to keep his trap shut. Mind you, the future has never appeared more dystopian. Some people are born with a mutation that enables them to levitate objects, and these fellows find that they can lure facile-minded babes into bed by making quarters float above the palms of their hands. The economy has hit bottom, and vagrancy has become epidemic. Citizens can execute vagrants on the spot if they feel so inclined. Any time Hollywood undertakes a time travel tale, the filmmakers conjure up some of the ugliest vehicles. While the cars and trucks look hopelessly tacky, the motorcycles resemble something Luke Skywalker might ride. Basically, you see a guy straddling a cylinder with handle bars. Computer-generated special effects blur everything beneath his feet so he appears to be cruising on a cushion of air.",2012
8,"Time travel films open up all manner of questions because of the paradoxes every action and reaction produce. If X occurred, surely Y would happen, which means X wouldn't happen after all And so it is with Looper. ",2012

4,"Very disappointing film,not even The wonderful Emily Blunt or JGL could save this film.",2012
2,"Having seen the overwhelmingly positive reviews of this film, i mistakenly believed it would at least be a passable science fiction/action movie. Sadly, the so called ""science"" portion of this movie is so absurdly handled i was compelled to vent about it.",2013
2,"If I was bored to tears why is this getting two stars, I hear you ask? There are two simple explanations really: the acting of Emily Blunt, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis, all of whom were typically good and believable as their characters; and making Joseph Gordon-Levitt look not only ill half the time but plausible as Bruce Willis's younger self - they did more than simply give Joseph contacts to wear (his eyes are typically a dark brown).",2012
1,"First of all, forget the plot. There isn't any, just a bunch of half baked, overdone, derivative ideas flung at the screen in the laziest piece of film writing I've ever seen. Visually the picture steals from Mad Max, Blade Runner, Witness, the Matrix, Carrie and another half dozen, better movies. But the most unforgivable thing it does is de-charm Joseph Gordon Levitt. One would not have thought this possible. Also in resurrecting the tiresome, bullet headed Bruce Willis, it reminded me of why I've always hated that guy. (His scenes with the Chinese broad were particularly excruciating.) All in all, a horrible mess that doesn't even have the guts to follow through on its set-ups.",2012
10,"I must admit, when I originally started to watch the show I had low expectations. Mainly because though I'd previously enjoyed Mindy Kaling's portrayal of Kelly Kapoor on The Office (US), I'd seen characters who are hilarious in supporting roles not be able to translate that humor into an entire show based around them as the lead character... I'm looking at you cast of Seinfeld. However, I was pleasantly surprised to be completely wrong in this case. ",2012
8,"I'm surprised the ratings aren't a little higher for ""The Mindy Project"" - with a lot of the crap out there, ""The Mindy Project"" is refreshingly quite funny. The characters are quirky, and I have a smile on my face pretty much the whole time I am watching the show. It's a nice break from all the drama filled teenage/girls/vampire shows that seem to be all the rave right now. ",2013
10,"Mindy Kaling delivers big time on this hilarious new show about being successful, ridiculous, and slightly awkward in a lovable way. This show is about Kaling, an OBGYN doctor who is balancing her path to finding love with work and is not afraid of being her funny self along the way. The first episode drew me in not only because of the witty banter between Mindy and her inevitable love interest but also because she is in essence every girl. Her love of romantic comedies and hope for these ideals to mirror her real life is fun to watch! This brown sugar also has an amazing cast of handsome co workers that make for some pretty good eye candy! This show is smart and witty and has plenty of laugh out loud moments! I hope that you all love this one!",2012
10,"I love it! I watched the pilot on a flight and instantly knew I needed to watch more. I think the banter and jokes are really great. It's been a while where I laugh out loud. The character is strong but that is what I love about it as she is witty, smart, appears to be insecure but is actually confident and just rolling with the punches.",2012
10,I love this show. I'm a bit surprised that the rating aren't higher but I agree with the other post that men probably will appreciate it a bit less because of the type of humor and that it has a female role with female issues. You can kind of think of it as the opposite of The Office where The Office has people act stupid to get laughs and the Mindy Project is kind of SMH... so true lol. ,2012
4,"I started binge watching this a few weeks ago and was hooked. What I didn't realize is I would soon be watching it only for the development of Mindy and Danny's relationship. Throughout the first couple seasons, Mindy spends most of her time trying to find someone she can marry and have kids with; she's very into fairy tales. She is constantly quoting rom-com's and how she wants her own love story to be that way. I could relate immensely to this because I too am a huge fan of ""happily ever afters"". I thoroughly enjoyed the humor and was greatly enjoying the show, especially when Mindy and Danny finally got together. But then...that's where it all seemed to fall apart. End of Season 3 and Season 4 was full of her lying to Danny about what she wanted. She went from wanting a marriage and family (which was all she wanted in Season 1 and 2) to being career obsessed and not wanting anymore children. It was the polar opposite of the show I had been watching and I lost interest quickly. What made me stop watching the show completely was when they kept portraying Danny like it was his fault for her completely changing character. I am disappointed that they were willing to change her character for political reasons. I have no issue with a show wanting to portray a strong female role that works and has a family. I think they didn't develop the change of her wants very well, it was sudden abrupt change that left me confused and irritated, not supportive.",2016
4,The first season of the Mindy Project was OK. There was some good chemistry. And the running jokes were funny.,2016
7,"The pilot episode had a few laughs but was underwhelming. That has changed with episode two where all the actors seems to have found their footing and the episode was very funny. Mindy's writing is sharp and if you like the humour on the Office, you should like this new series as well.",2012
6,"I happily binge-watched the first few seasons. I was skeptic at first, what with a former Supporting actress from 'The Office' taking on a lead role in a TV series, but I was impressed.",2016
10,"This show has me cracking up from the first minute to the last. Mindy's character is so funny, and best of all, relatable! She makes the dating game struggle so much more funny and light- hearted, and its a good reminder to not take things too seriously in life. I love the rest of the cast- Morgan is great- and I think Mindy and Danny have good chemistry. This show is so fresh and funny in completely new ways. Mindy really brings something irreplacable to the humor.",2013
10,"I love this show! It's really well-written and super funny. I'm also a huge fan of her from the Office and her book was awesome( seriously if you haven't read it you should!). She's really funny and easy to relate too,like I want to be her best friend. The cast is really cool and they works so well together, especially in the cameos. The plot isn't too dense, but there always a plot to follow each episode and a possible office romance. Not sure which character is my favorite yet because I love them all so much. It's a quirky show but easy to relate to because of Mindy's experiences throughout the season between boyfriends, her job and random opinions on things!",2013
4,"Like other reviewers said, the show goes downhill in season three and keeps going downhill from that point on.",2016
10,I loved Mindy Khaling. She is the perfect blend of charm and neurosis. This show is the perfect vehicle for her and I really hope it stays on TV because I think it has real potential. ,2012
10,"Mindy Kaling is a smart cookie. It shows in her character, the writing, and the dynamic of the show. I started watching the Mindy Project because it airs after New Girl and honestly as the episodes go by, I find myself liking Mindy's show more and more and have garnered quite a distaste for New Girl. The difference for me is in the strength of the female characters. Mindy does an amazing job portraying a smart, successful, self-possessed woman who is still charming, quirky, and sometimes neurotic. You won't find that combination in New Girl, at least not in the two female leads. I hope the Mindy Project keeps it up; any basic cable show that sneaks words like ""defenestrated"" in casual conversation is a winner in my book.",2013
9,"Lets start off with the cast. Everyone likes eye candy in a show and well this show won't have the likes that you see in CSI or Grey's anatomy. But its cast is strong, the characters are quirky and you grow attached to them.",2013
1,"I had high hopes for Mindy when I saw the first few episodes. But gradually she fell into the same old trap of making the whole show around her character's unrealistic view her romantic life. So much so that she writes out the one blonde character who's far more attractive than she is so she's surrounded by Ghetto Barbi and the Lunchroom Lady. This could have been a great show if only Kaling would have just been true to herself. There are tons of chubby, non-white, non-blonde, average looking young girls in need of role models on TV. They need to know you don't have to be pretty and slim to have a starring role on a show.",2017
6,"Okay, she is the main character, BUT she is so full of herself, the world revolves around her, the way she treats others is not funny it's just bitchy. Gave it a shot, but after 6 episodes I'd rather watch the laundry dry. Some very good supporting characters, they deserve the 6 stars...",2017
10,"This is a really funny show. It's about an offbeat character that is ""rough around the edges"" in a way that reminds me of ""The New Adventures of Old Christine,"" which is also hilarious. While the dialog is great, somethings in the different story lines are somewhat far-fetched, however, might I remind you that most things that you seen on TV these days are. I don't know why, but for some odd reason, I find the banter to be absolutely comedic, the best part of the show. Some people will say that the story lines are ""overused, cliché,"" which is true, but I have to give it to them that those overused story lines are being used in the most original way imaginable. This is a hilarious show, one of my favorite comedy shows, and I definitely will be watching for more Dr. Lahiri in the future.",2013
9,"I was worried that this show was going to be a let down... It definitely proved me wrong. Mindy is as hilarious as always (if not even more so) and the show gets more addicting with each episode. The character of ""Mindy"" is able to connect with the viewer and seem like a real person without having to sacrifice the humour like they do in many other shows (which was something I loved about the office) It's definitely a show worth watching, especially if you're unsure. Very different than Kelly on the office but in some ways very similar. A comedy where the main actor plays a fully realized character that the average viewer can become invested in/relate to in many different ways.",2013
1,Dreadful. Dreadful. Dreadful.,2014
9,"I love love love this show. I think that the writing and dialogue is absolutely hilarious. Witty and fast paced. I admit I hate the sexist attitude of Mindy's coworkers but that just makes it so much more entertaining to watch Mindy succeed. I think it's a great show and I think it's refreshing to see a woman on television who isn't the perfect American idea of beauty.I'm sick of seeing a tall, thin, perfect blonde complain about how hard it is for her to find a guy. She's curvy, and *gasp* she's not perfect. I think it's awesome to see a beautiful representation of what woman really look like on television. I didn't mean this to turn into some feminist statement so to wrap it up I'd just like to reiterate that this show is hilarious, and I really hope to see it on the air for at leas ta few more seasons!",2013
9,"Started watching this show, having no idea who Mindy Kaling was(having never watched the American version of 'The Office'). And now I adore her and this show! Have just completed watching a marathon of all the episodes.. and they had better not cancel it! The show is fresh, funny, quirky and really quite unique. Love the main character who is a little crazy and soo not-perfect, quite lovable and definitely relate-able, can be vulnerable but also gutsy- love how she just rolls with the punches! Enjoy the MindyDanny chemistry- usually very entertaining. Overall great writing, great cast. It would be a 10 if the female supporting cast got more 'meatier' roles and if they incorporated just a little more of the 'workplace' in 'workplace comedy.' Or did I misread that bit somewhere? All the same, I think that would nicely balance out the 'unconventional romcom' aspect of the show.",2014
3,"The 3 is only because I loved the first two seasons. It was funny and light with the right amount of sass. Enter Danny as boyfriend which I admit was initially exciting because it took so long for him to figure it out. Unfortunately I almost hate it now due specifically to Danny. He is a selfish, boorish, misogynistic a-hole and I have a hard time watching Mindy acquiesce to him time and time again. I actually feel anger toward his character and I feel like the show condones this behaviour towards women. It's pretty much unwatchable now unless they totally break up and he leaves the show. I also wish the show hadn't saddled her with a child, but here we are.",2016
9,"To be honest, just based on the first episode, I wasn't terribly impressed beyond the obvious writing skills of Kaling herself, but it didn't take long for the show to get its sea legs and start up stories that I could really invest in.",2013
10,"I just can't get enough of this film. This year alone I have already watched it 4 times (and the year isn't even done yet).

It was a huge success because it gave fans of the horror genre something new. It made them laugh because it lovingly poked fun at a genre the fans knew by heart.

Where Scream chose to laugh about dumb things people do in horror movies, Cabin decides instead to respectfully explain...well, everything - and making you laugh/scream while it does. ",2012

10,"I would normally be leery of giving out a perfect 10 rating, but if ever there was a modern horror movie that was worthy of a 10, it's this one. ""Cabin in the Woods"" has done what I no longer thought was possible for a horror movie, it blew my mind and showed me something I never expected. When I first saw a trailer for this on television I thought ""Oh great, another recycled, clichéd horror flick. Can't they think of anything other than putting a group of young people in a stale setting and kill them off one by one?"" Well it would appear that they can. This is a film that is nearly impossible to market effectively without giving anything away. Some of the more recent trailers have included much more footage that gives a glimpse into what this movie REALLY is about. Word of mouth should be the biggest factor that helps make this movie popular. I just hope for your sake that no one spoils this brilliant gem for you. It's best to go into it with as little information as possible. I really enjoyed the pacing of this movie. They could've taken this in an entirely different direction if they simply wanted to shock you at the end. Instead, they treat the film like a slow, steady reveal. In fact, the opening scene does not even feature the group of kids that we follow on their horrific trip to the cabin. Instead, it opens with the ""other"" side of this story and the characters who get about as much screen time as our heroine and her pals. The result is a cinematic experience like none other. The audience is fed bits of information little by little throughout the entire film, so you're always hot on the trail of this story's secrets. You won't know exactly what's going on but you'll feel like you have a pretty good grasp on things the further you advance into it. In reality, every time this plot reveals a twist, it also introduces more brand new questions into your mind. So the twists don't just come completely out of left field and shock you, but they guide you through a very intriguing story that manages to keep expanding into something bigger and bigger. I'm so glad they wrote the script this way. I feel like 9 times out of 10 the writers of today would be too tempted to create a story that hides everything behind the curtain and focuses solely on the kids at this cabin. That way they can build up to a final payoff that no one would ever see coming. This payoff is too big to simply catch you off guard with. They got this right, a movie that isn't only original for the end of the third act, but a refreshing journey from start to finish. Go experience this film before you overhear people talking about it at the water cooler.",2012
1,Is this some kind of a joke? Are there cameras that filming people's reactions and laughing at them or what?,2012
1,"The Cabin In The Woods starts off as, what seemed to be a horror comedy - the cliché college students (a jock, a blonde girl, a stoner, a nerd and a virgin) meet up to spend the weekend in a cabin together. 'Fair enough', I thought. But that thought didn't last long. Here is a list of things that bugged me about this film:",2013
9,"The horror genre for me has been pretty mediocre for the past several years, and so I have pretty much ignored a lot of horror movies that have come out, with the exception of a few. However, after the buzz surrounding Cabin, I knew it was something I had to see. And sure enough, Cabin delivers in spades. It has everything a horror fan could want, from our favorite clichés to some fantastic surprises. Suffice to say, every horror fan should go see this.",2012
1,"This latest critical darling comes from Drew Goddard and Josh Whedon. A writer/director team with an extensive background intelevision. This review is now sufficient enough to end right here, but I'll soldier on anyway. ",2012
1,"Give me a break. This movie was awful. Full of clichés and the most ridiculous twist that, quite frankly, ruins anything good that happened in this train-wreck of a movie in the first place. Is this really what passes for good horror today?",2012
1,"Literally a waste of time, if the movie has any redeeming qualities it would be the slight humour in the film. It's advertised as having a crazy twist and 'you think you know the story' etc... Basically if you've seen the advert you'll know what's going on.",2012
10,"After the opening title, we are thrown into the social standard of the guts and glory horror we all know and love. Five friends decide to drive their van out to an abandoned cabin in the woods and along the way they come across a creepy old man at a run down petrol station; nothing could go wrong right? And what would a stereotypical horror scenario be without with out it's cliché's characters; the stoner; the jock; the nerd; the popular girl and the virgin - well, sort of. Much to the hilarity of the film the group do just about everything you shouldn't do when in a creepy cabin; which results in them fighting for there lives when suddenly under attack from bombarding creatures of the night.",2012
8,"The writers of this film stated that they didn't like how the horror genre has become. Full of unlikable characters that we don't care if they live or die. Cabin in the Woods sounds like a generic horror film with a generic premise and generic horror characters. When you see it closely, it's an intriguing high concept satirical horror film. It may look absurd but it's actually brilliant and smart. It has campy scares and some good laughs. Cabin in the Woods is an enjoyable horror film with an unlikely twist.",2012
1,One of the most disgusting movies i've ever seen in my life ,2012
5,"""I love being scared."" So said Joss Whedon in an interview with Total Film regarding ""The Cabin in the Woods,"" which he produced and co-wrote with director Drew Goddard. ""The things that I don't like are kids acting like idiots, the devolution of the horror movie into torture porn and into a long series of sadistic comeuppances. Drew and I both felt that the pendulum had sung a little too far in that direction."" When I first read that quote a few weeks ago, I wished Whedon had been there with me, for I wanted to shake him by the hand and thank him for publicly reaffirming what I've felt about horror movies for quite some time. But then I actually saw ""The Cabin in the Woods,"" and I couldn't help but wonder why I wasn't seeing things as he saw them. Something wasn't quite right.",2012
1,"I am writing this review to help those who fall into the trap of seeing a rating of 7.9 and thinking this film must have some redeeming qualities. Believe me it doesn't. It is ridiculous and abysmal. The scary thing is the sort of individual that enjoys this film is the same individual that states scream is original. Some may find this deeply disturbing but I would be quite happy to live in a world without films such as scream, there i said it. There was only one scene that I found funny and it was when Mr athlete decided to ride his bike into a force field of some sort. I began thinking something worth while was going to happen but this moment never came.",2012
1,This is the absolute worst movie that I have ever seen in my life. The acting and the plot were absolutely awful. The people who gave it an 8.1 rating out of 10 are completely insane. Don't waste your time and money on this outrageously stupid and awful movie. The movie is basically about a bunch of stupid teenagers who decide to go on a camping trip to a friends cousins camp when randomly a bunch of zombies begin to attack everyone. The only thing that is truly keeping my attention while watching this movie was the fact that Chris Hemsworth was in it. This movie is the most pointless thing I have ever seen in my entire life. Snakes On A Plane was a much better movie than this.SERIOUSLY DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,2012
8,"I'm not a horror fan. Although, films pertaining to demonic possession scare me into a four year old, it's just not my taste. I'm also pretty late in watching this movie. I found it online and decided to watch since I had nothing else to do. I was kind of intrigued after seeing Joss Whedon's name in the credits for producing and writing. ",2012
10,"There are no words to express how amazing this movie was. What one would assume would be a typical horror cliché is actually treated to one of the most creative movies I've ever seen. Although most people could expect what the movie contained from the previews, as I did, they will still be blow away by this movie. Not from the acting or directing or anything like that, but from the pure originality of the movie. The last horror movie I remember seeing that was this original, inventive, and down right badass was Scream, and with a equally satisfying deliverance of it's gritty, gory, grisly, and tongue in cheek attitude. Anyone who goes to see this movie will surely get their money's worth and then some.",2012
4,"This movie is not utter crap, but it's not a work of genius either. It's far-fetched, and I don't mean it in the way that it features supernatural beings, no, but in the way that its unpredictability is so predictable. It's as if the creators of the movie couldn't really decide what to do with it except to make it as ludicrous as possible. Furthermore, while I am aware of Whedon's commentary, explicitly stated ideas of the movie, I consider it not important. Because, frankly, this movie couldn't function as a satire even if it got to the top of Mount Everest and shouted angrily at the world for not being what it was supposed to be.",2012
3,"My husband turned to me as the end credits started rolling and said ""That was the worst movie I ever saw."" And I agree with him. It starts off OK as any cabin in the woods movie would. But it goes somewhere incomprehensible shortly thereafter. Whatever unfolds is without explanation. And if it's supposed to be a spoof of all previous horror films ever made (as some have said in other reviews) it is still a miss. Spoiler Alert: it's not scary at all! There is slasher blood, lot's of it. And zombies (I am so over zombies). I either missed or didn't understand what the big twist is many talk about. You know from the first scene of the movie there are people in charge of overseeing the cabin and all that goes on there. There was no twist. Period. It's just a stupid movie with no plot and no horror. And I'm sorry, but if you either love, like, or recommend this movie you are smoking way too much of that stuff Marty smokes. Do not go to see this movie if you are over 20. I give it a 3 because I did LOL a few times, so I guess I was mildly entertained once or twice. PS... The cameo appearance at the end is NOT by ""a horror movie icon"" as several have stated. Those are 2 completely different genres of movies.",2012
9,"I loved this show. I despise the unreality of ""reality TV"" but this belongs, I suppose, at the edges of that genre. It also belongs at the edges of the late night talk show genre, but with a host who engages rather than quizzes and allows guests to shill their current project...and the content here is often deeper and more interesting than the typical talk show's. The ""story"" is simply: Jerry picks up a comedian (or two) he is friends with, driving an amazing classic car, and they go for coffee, sometimes a meal, and they talk.",2012
10,"It's a novel concept and rolls stand-up comedy, reality TV and our fascination with celebrities into one little bite-sized but right-sized segment.",2012
10,"First off, I love how the car is intuitively matched to the subject. It's hilarious because an inanimate object is worth a thousand words.",2012
10,"As an earlier reviewer stated, I had very high expectations for Jerry Seinfeld. Afterall, I built my Thursday night around him for 9 years! When I watched the first episode, I thought, ""meh"". Then I gave it another try, then another, and another, and then consumed every single one of them and they got better and better as they went along. I watched them in no particular order either. I want more. I have to say, it is just totally enjoyable and I feel like a student watching the masters at work. They know that a camera is on them and I am quite certain that there are amazing conversations that never make it to the precious few minutes we get, but what comes across is genuine and warm and as with the last one I watched with Michael Richards, totally moving. I choked up and teared a bit on the last minute or so. I was not expecting that and this is what's best about this show. Please Jerry, make more!",2013
9,"Seinfeld boldly defined a new genre with this series, defying convention and putting fans first. So much is different about this series: It's distributed only on Crackle and his own dedicated web site, the episodes are an usual 14-18 minutes long, the format itself is unique, and the sole sponsor Acura created customized advertising content that they integrated into the show.",2014
8,"It's one of the best web series around. On every episode, Jerry Seinfeld drives a fellow comedian in a car and gets coffee. Of course, the cars and the coffee are secondary. It's Jerry and friends. Most of time, it is hilarious or at least very funny. It's comedians shooting the breeze. It's very rare when the show falls completely flat. The only one that comes to mind is Todd Barry. He's so mellow that the show almost stops dead. Every show has some old story, funny bits, recalling old times, or theories on comedy. The names of the guests are a compelling list of who's who in comedy. It's one of the very few web series that can truly be called must-see.",2014
9,"Seinfeld has always been classy and thoughtful and this show echoes the originality of his TV series ""Seinfeld."" It's a thinking-person's style of humor with great stories, unique personalities, and down-to-earth situations that make viewers feel like we are a part of these comedians' lives, at least for a moment. The combination of a car, a guest, and a coffee shop is a very Seinfeld-esque quirky that has that ""wish I'd thought of it"" feel to it. I've been able to introduce several family members and friends by hooking them from different angles. My car-loving brother-in-law likes the car selections, my sister likes the human behavior angle, and my friend just likes to see some favorite comedians. I enjoy all of the above, plus the artfully selected filming angles. The whole show is a pleasure. My wife and I have re-watched several of the episodes. Even the commercials seem to blend elegantly with both the theme of the show and the delivery style. Arriving in a world flooded with entertainment, CCC is a fresh and invigorating show. I hope Seinfeld continues to expand the series, as I want to meet more people and hear more conversation!",2014
8,Jerry Seinfeld has always been a top entertainer and he does not disappoint in this little gem of a show. Jerry and his guests are all in top form being both interesting and entertaining. The banter Jerry and guest have is obviously spontaneous.,2013
9,"First of all this show is all about two comedians(rarely accompanied by a third guest) telling each others anecdotes mostly regarding comedy biz and having conversations that remind us the ones Jerry and George were having in the Seinfeld. The concept of driving to get a coffee and the coffee place are simply the stage of the show where the comedians have their conversations. The cars and the coffee places are not really the subjects of the show. So do not expect great deal of information about the cars. Jerry tells about the cars so little as to make a mere introduction of the machines they are going to enjoy as part of the day. As a Turkish person who lives in Turkey where the comedy is made by few people and mostly with poor taste, i really admire American comedy which is very rich with its many comedians and concepts and i still discover this great comedy culture. This shows brings a lot of young comedians and legends to screen(of the internet) and they tell amazing stories in the tone of a friendly, casual get- together. A great example of one of these moments in the show, was when Jimmy Fallon told an anecdote about Jack Nicholson and Cracker Jacks. The concept of the show is very smart for revealing these moments. In this sense, it is similar to a late night talk show only it is more relaxed and the guests are exclusively comedians. Very entertaining and original. i hope to see many seasons of this show, with comedians like Larry David, Louis CK, Ricky Gervais and Jimmy Fallon reappearing along with legends.",2015
8,"Possible Spoil Alert--This is a general overview of Jerry Seinfeld himself. The comedians on the show make the show. Jerry is just the inventor of it. I would give a better rating if Jerry Seinfeld didn't have such airs about himself. At first he seems very personable but later he makes comments to his guests that makes you wonder if he likes his fans or just 'regular' people at all. As time goes by I find myself liking Jerry Seinfeld less and less. However, the guests do their best and I find myself interested in the person whether they are funny or not. The cars are somewhat interesting to someone who really doesn't care about cars but not as interesting as the comedians themselves. Jerry does a good job doing nothing, just not great at being humble or very interesting himself.",2016
1,"Seinfeld is a jackass. He is so full of himself and this show only a testament of his big ego, always inviting guest to lick his ass and say how wonderful he is and that he already made it in one lame show so there is no need to act anymore or do some actual work.",2014
1,These other review must be trolls or paid for because this show is plain horrible. I love stand up and I love most of the guest comedians but I watched the first 2 episodes and found it painfully boring. Jerry somehow managed to get in a car with some of the greatest comedians of all time and make it unfunny.,2018
7,"It is a good show but not funny. It is a casual conversation with famous people, so even though there are lots of comedians in some episodes I do not even smile. It is not like other shows which usually are like interviews but a normal and sometimes boring conversations with once a while nice surprises. I think it is best to chose an episode which involves your favorite famous person and watch that episode to recognize that person like regular person not like a celebrity. I am also not a fan of cars so I just skip that part. Also I do not understand that weird cuts to filling coffee to cups lots of times. OK, I saw it! So in conclusion it is a fine but boring work with rare brilliant moments.",2015
8,Why does the pour of every single liquid sound the same?! Every time there is a clip of someone pouring coffee (and it happens a lot) it is the exact same sound effect. Every. Time. ,2018
3,However it's completely ruined by the loud overbearing overly upbeat music. It's incredibly distracting. Take out the derpy music and you have a binge worthy show.,2018
4,Jerry the TV character is far more likable than Jerry the ultra rich snob who seems to loathe the masses. Doesn't anyone have the balls to tell him how ridiculous running shoes and blazers look?,2018
9,"And THAT is what makes Jerry Seinfeld so amazing. His comedy and TV shows are examples of the genius of simplicity... and what makes Comedians in Cars one of the VERY few shows that I watch regularly, including network and cable productions. He knows exactly what questions to ask the high and mighty of comedy to get inside of their heads, connect you with them emotionally, and remove the interview away from the boring stage with curtains and a side kick friend. No late night cookie cutter here... he is on to something brand new that should endure for a good while. ",2016
10,"Sunday, March 20 - Just watched this week's Single Shot: Best Ever!!!",2016
7,"I found the jokes about ad placement to be pretty amusing. The only things I don't like are the joke interviews with the ""Crackle President"" (although Mr. Richards is hilarious), and how much conversation is cut out by ""B roll"" of music and walking around. Mr. Seinfeld is still very relevant and these conversations are incredibly honest most of the time. I've already recommended it to several folks I know. There are many beautiful places he visits, and the cars don't always do what he expects. I've been skipping around through the seasons, and I think my favorite episode is tied between Louis C.K. and Tina Fey. Clearly, he is very respected among his comedic peers.",2015
3,"A bit funny here and there. Jerry's inflated ego, however, permeates every second of the show, even when he doesn't say much. I find it irritating. Not to mention the (often) hideous sneakers that he so craftily tends to mismatch with the jackets.",2018
7,"If you like Jerry Seinfeld, you'll love this. The humor used by Jerry is so dry that it's worthy of cry-laughing. At some points of the episodes it gets so dry and cliché that it's not funny. This would definitely make you laugh by just looking at Jerry and his overall happy-go lucky personality. In his television show, we get a personal one to one connection with the big man himself. Some episodes he gets personal and we get to know about his early life as a child to what he did when he woke up. The comedians that Jerry has on his show are very funny. Tina Fey was my favorite. The one quality I love about Jerry is the fact that he had the Internet star, MirandaSings, on his show. She is not considered a ""movie star"" because she is a Youtube star with over 3 million followers. I believe he's giving a helping hand to her by giving her the right connections on the professional side of things. He's giving her a bigger opportunity to becoming more well known and popular amongst the world. The cherry on top with this TV series would be the cars. Every episode he very methodically picks out which car he should get coffee in with the comedians. Personally, my favorite car that he drove in was the 1960 Austin Healey with MirandaSings, surprisingly. The car is one of the most beautiful ""sports"" cars every created. Even though it only goes a max of 115 MPH, It sure is a beautiful car to see driving down the road. For an $88,000 car, it is definitely worth it. The only way you can own and drive this car was if you live in California or south western Florida.",2015
1,"If you're into classic cars, then this is for you. Your host, Jerry Seinfeld, has a good knowledge and appreciation of classic cars. I've never seen his comedy shows and quite frankly I don't care to. He's very egotistical and patronising to his guests who are, for the most part, regular folk who aren't all that funny in ""real life"". His attempt to appear interesting by wearing jackets and brightly colored sneakers is rather sad. Watch all the car scenes and fast forward the rest.",2018

1,"Let's kick off with the score I've given it. 5/10. That's for the reasonable job with the comedy, design, and things not related to story and pacing (with the exception of Gollum and the cave scene). I am tired of saying ""The graphics are great, but..."" I have rated it 1 here to reduce the average in order to reflect reality and not the fanboy love-in.",2012
1,"THE QUALITY OF THE FILM Imagine ""Spy Kids"" with elements of Tolkien's writing. Technological demonstration, a large budget at the hands of a tasteless creative group. The CG animation of trolls was almost as ugly as in the Lord of the Rings. The only reason of making it 3D was making me cope with the uncomfortably of 3D. The dwarf parcour and scenes copied from the Lord of the Rings (compare the fight of Thorin and Azog with that of Isildur and Sauron), artificially added action-scenes and castrated non-action scenes spoke of lazy, commercial, mainstream work. Radagast's animal companions were Walt Disney's ""Snow-white"" bad.",2012
2,"I was about 8 years old when I was first introduced to the Hobbit from the animated 1 hour movie. The movie was a yearly event. As a child, it freaked me out. But, my Dad loved Glenn Yarbrough and the music, so, I was made to sit through it.",2012
4,"""All great stories deserve a little embellishment."" So says Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) in the most telling line in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, Peter Jackson's return to the world of JRR Tolkien. It's a line that clearly outlines Jackson and his co-writers' intentions, yet it comes off as a veiled apology, as if the film-making team knew that what they have created is going to be problematic for die-hard Middle Earth fans. Sadly, Jackson's new film doesn't come close to silencing the skeptics like his Lord of the Rings films did, and is actually more ill-conceived than expected.",2012
1,"First came the original trilogy, a popular success and critically acclaimed. Then, some years later, a second trilogy began, a prequel to the original, and the first installment of this second trilogy turned out to be awful. We saw this pattern play out once, with ""Star Wars,"" and now, alas, it begins again, with ""The Hobbit,"" a movie that is exactly one Jar Jar Binks away from being as bad as ""The Phantom Menace."" The problem may be built into the design. The previous ""Lord of the Rings"" films were each based on a single book. ""The Hobbit"" - more like a children's novel than the other three, a kind of ""Tom Sawyer"" to their ""Huckleberry Finn"" - is just one book, smaller than any of the other J.R.R. Tolkien books, and yet it is being blown out into three enormous films. This first installment runs 169 minutes.",2012
4,"This is the first of three films Peter Jackson has made to adapt J.R.R. Tolkien's prequel to Lord of the Rings. An elderly Bilbo Baggins writes to Frodo about the land of Erebor, where the Dwarf King Thror lost his land and prosperity to the dragon Smaug. Bilbo then recalls the earlier years of his life (played by Martin Freeman), where he's timid and lost his sense of adventure. Bilbo's complacency is questioned by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen), who secretly arranges for a meeting to be held in the hobbit's house. One evening Bilbo is interrupted by thirteen dwarfs who invite themselves inside. He's told these dwarfs are in search of a home but need a burglar who can accompany them to the mountain where Smaug is and take back their land and treasure. Initially reluctant, Bilbo trails after the unit but this does little to impress Thorin (Richard Armitage), the dwarf leader and grandson of Thror, who doubts the hobbit's commitment. ",2012
2,"I am bitterly disappointed by this film. It's noisy, jumbled, and chaotic, far too violent (it was a children's book, for heaven's sake!), and almost completely formless. The action sequences are just ridiculous, and what's worse is that they look fake - maybe an artifact of filming a 3D movie and then showing a 2D version, but something that you can't say of the LoTR movies. This was like a not very attractive cartoon.",2012

4,"If misstepping were an aerobic exercise, Peter Jackson would be in excellent shape. Although I am loath to admit it, this adaptation of ""The Hobbit"" is unsatisfactory in many, many ways. It strikes me as Tolkien meets ""Bad Taste,"" meets ""Braindead,"" meets the Feeblest excuse for a three-film extravaganza. After foolishly buying tickets for two screenings in advance, I have now had the displeasure of seeing the film twice in 3D HFR. The experience leaves me embarrassed to have invested so much gleeful anticipation into the release of this film. It very nearly taints my love for the LotR films, though in the end that love remains intact. Here are just a few of the serious issues I observed: 1. The screenplay departs wildly from the heart of this whimsical tale. Two themes are central to the book: first, the moral bankruptcy arising from greed and the lust for gold. This stems in part from Tolkien's adaptation of the Volsungsaga, wherein a dwarf turns into a dragon through greed. Thorin is becoming a dragon (metaphorically). Second, the self-discovery of Bilbo and his emerging moral strength, set within the symbolism of a seasonal journey from spring to spring. This first film does almost nothing to set up these points, aside from some cringe-worthy and heavy-handed dialogue that violates PJ's oft-stated stricture against saying instead of showing (in film). Bilbo's development is too sudden and inadequately motivated in the film. What little emotional payoff exists is forced and manipulated, not earned by what precedes.",2012
3,"First, let me say the Lord of the Rings movies were all first-rate and stayed pretty close to the original Tolkien books. Unfortunately, The Hobbit is not, because it does not. It really is a bad movie by design. Choices were made to add slapstick comedy and fabricate added story lines which bloat, rather than add, to the movie, and quite simply to stray from the book liberally (presumably) for commercial reasons. The choice to do so is curious given the overwhelming success (commercial and critical) of the LOTR formula of being faithful to the books.",2013
3,"When I first heard that Peter Jackson had decided to make ""The Hobbit"" into three movies I was rather surprised. ""The Hobbit"" is not a long or complex book. Just a simple story with some good characters and a good plot that moves along briskly. Unfortunately, the same thing cannot be said of the movie, the first of three. Jackson had four screenwriters, which may explain why this movie is such a muddle, and may also explain its inordinate length. I figure that after all the movies are made I'll be able read the book faster than watch all three movies. The movie is very slow moving, even many of the fight sequences. I fell asleep at one point and awoke dismayed that the movie still had an hour to go.",2012

3,"I put up with the various faux-pas that were made with the first three films being 'The Lord of The Rings' trilogy. I kind of saw that it's hard to avoid the 'god-complex' to do it and forgave the wargs being turned into large hyenas, the character assassination of Faramir, the unnecessary tack on of Arwen in places... the really bad casting for Eowyn (sword wielding and regal, please, NOT little girl lost).

10,"As a huge fan of the musical, I have religiously followed this film through its production from behind-the-scenes to trailers to sneak-peaks. And let me tell you, Les Mis did not disappoint! From the very beginning and the first swells of the orchestra's music, I was hooked. And through the whole 2.5 hour movie, I was riveted.",2012

10,"As someone who has been burned by every single Hollywood adaptation of Les Miserables, let me categorically state that this time it was done right! Everything from the acting to the music to the sets was borderline perfect. The only thing that could possibly be considered a negative was something that was absolutely unavoidable. That is, when you are taking a novel as voluminous as Les Miserables and condensing it into a feature length movie, some things will be cut or rushed. This is no exception. The movie moves at breakneck speed. Anyone who is fond of the Broadway musical will no doubt not be bothered by it, but people new to the story or those who have only read the novel might be put off by it.",2012
8,"Les Miserables is very old fashioned entertainment. It's a series of crescendo moments with no build-up, no backstory, no pause. It's like eating just the topping of the pecan pie, and not bothering with the crust or filling. We were just ten minutes into the movie when I had to look at my watch and ask, okay, how long can they keep this up? Climax after climax, plot twist after plot twist, tearjerking scene after tearjerking scene. Oceans! Mountains! Punishment! Suffering! Religion! Redemption! Will there be a break for lunch? Will we be able to catch our breath? ",2012

I do not remember the last time that an audio-visual experience inflicted me with so much pain, both mentally and physically. I think my theatre seat still has indentations from me clutching the chair frantically throughout the movie. I felt like the Clockwork Orange protagonist when he's tied down to a chair and fed those nauseating stimuli (the main difference being that he got to listen to some quality music in the process). It is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. And I've seen a lot of hubris in my time.",2013
2,"I went into this film with high hopes since the cast has some very talented actors, and then I remember it was a musical, and most of these people can't sing.

That's not the case with this big, horrible mess.",2013

Now believe me I recognize why people like this movie so much, and even though the music is absolutely fantastic and I'm going to buy the OST, as a movie or at least THIS movie, it's just really bad. I feel terrible saying that since everyone loves this movie but I just have to get this off my chest.",2013
9,"Going into Les Miserables I was a huge fan of the long running stage show. Going in I didn't know what to expect? From the opening shot of the French flag under water. The camera shoots from the water to the ear popping sound of the orchestra. The convicts are pulling ships into the shore. It truly is amazing effects and the sound is overwhelming. The story of Les Mis is about Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) prisoner 24601 as he is given his yellow ticket of leave by the Inspector Javert (Russell Crowe) , he becomes a better man and becomes a Mayor. When Fantine (Anne Hathaway) is dying and her daughter is in need of a carer, Valjean says he'll raise the child. Our movie is set around these characters. Hugh Jackman- Superb as our lead with a great voice as well.Oscar worthy performances Anne Hathaway- A certain winner for best supporting actress, she brought me to tears. Russell Crowe- his acting is splendid. His singing not so much but the more I hear his voice the more I begin to like! Eddie Raymane- he's the big surprise for me. He ails every note as our young boy searching for love. Amanda Seyfried- though she wasn't in much her voice was mouth droppingly beautiful. Cohen and Bonham Carter- hilarious! Nothing else to say. Samantha Barks- she has the best voice and has amazing talent for someone unknown to the film world. For people to know... Les Miserables is 100% singing s you've been warned. Yes some might not like it and some will love it! For me I loved it. It was a tear jerking, heart racing at times picture with amazing sets. Brilliant Acting also! Anne Hathaway is the high point of the movie. It starts high, then goes amazing to dull and boring to comic relief to romance to gut wrenching action! Les Miserables it's self for me...it's one of the years best!",2013
1,"This was one of the worst movies I have seen in years. Interestingly, Russell Crowe has gotten canned which is a shame, because he actually did a good job. Listening to Wolverine, whom I like, sing for three hours was painful. Sorry, but Hugh Jackman was terribly miscast. Anne Hathaway was decent, but she cannot sing either. The ONLY really good performance in this movie was the child, who by the way comes from the London Stage production of Oliver. It showed. He could sing. He had talent. Otherwise this was an assembly of basically TV actors and a couple rock star types. The real tragedy of this movie is that the people who could have done it justice, those with musical stage capability, never got the chance to make the kind of money Hugh Jackman, et. al pulled down for this.",2013
5,"I wanted to watch Les Miserables in a movie theater but somehow I did not manage to do it on time, so I bought the DVD.... Sorry for the money.",2013
9,"I confess that I got surprised in the first 15 minutes of the movie, when at no time did the actors stop singing for ""normal lines"", I had never seen a movie with that format.",2017
1,"OK lets put this in context. I like a decent musical, whether mainstream or off the wall. I've enjoyed Rent (massively), The Fix, Miss Saigon, Nine and many others. However I don't do Lloyd-Webber. And now I don't do Schonberg/Boublil either.",2013

8,"I only had one thought on my mind for this Christmas: see Django Unchained. Quentin Tarantino's latest opus, a Western set two years before the Civil War, concerns a former slave named Django (Jamie Foxx). He is freed by bounty hunter Dr. King Shultz (Christoph Waltz) in order to help him with a bounty. Quite quickly, Shultz takes Django under his wing and trains him as his partner. But he made him a promise: that he would rescue his wife from a plantation owned by the ruthless Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). And rescuing her is not going to be all that easy.",2012
1,"To put it short Quentin tarantinos latest venture is a self indulgent ego fest, it showcases his deluded view of filmmaking where when Tarantino makes a movie that it's an instant classic. It doesn't matter how overlong, boring, poor comedic timing, uninspired script devoid of quips or intelligence and how much over the top, gratuitous violence that is involved.",2013
10,Merry Christmas to all you Tarantino fans out there. I hope you made a Tarantino checklist so here we go.,2012
4,I am a hardcore Tarantino fan and I must say I had great expectations for this movie. I can now honestly say that in my opinion Django Unchained is Tarantino's worst film to this day. ,2013
6,"Let me make it clear. I did enjoy most of it, but I also found myself looking at my watch and hoping it would end sooner. If there was a film this year that more than deserves the adjective excessive, this is it. It's a decent film, with plenty of action, some very funny scenes, and three of the best performances of the year: Jackson's house slave is almost as good as Washington's performance. He's an interesting and complex character, somehow who we can't even imagine existed. He's the darker twin of Scarlet's mammy in ""GWTW"", way darker and just as fascinating. There's of course, another star turn by De Caprio, puzzling, magnetic, depraved, and ruthless, and Waltz creates another memorable character, a foreigner who can't comprehend what's going on in his world, but who doesn't stop from taking advantage of the situation without losing his soul.",2012
1,"In his previous film ""Inglorious Basterds"" Tarantino presents two worthy scenes - the one with the Nazi officer in the French farmer's house, and the one in the bar where the British and American spies are in German uniforms talking to a suspicious SS German officer and a shootout follows.",2013
1,"I have never been a fan of Quentin Tarantino, but I know that other people think he's great so I decided to give him another chance and actually paid $3 to see ""Django Unchained."" I was surprised to find that I liked the first part of the movie. It was interesting, funny, suspenseful, and actually seemed to have a point. Some of the story strained credulity (look it up), but it stayed within the bounds of believability... until the German bounty hunter shot DeCaprio. Then believability went out the window.",2013
6,"Modern exploitation guru Quentin Tarantino serves up historical revenge once again. His last film, INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, had the German Nazis getting theirs, and now, with a good German on board (in fact he's the villain from the last film) we're out to set things right in the American Deep South, two years shy of the Civil War ",2012
1,"Jesus, where to begin. Completely juvenile, rabbit trails galore, slow moving, get to the firkin point. The way the scenes drag and the endless explaining and talking. This movie was so distasteful, predictable and irritating. First of all, Foxx was miscast, he does not do period well, at all, totally unbelievable here, after years of slavery he's suddenly the fastes gun in the west, PLEASE! ",2013
1,"This is teenage garbage, plain and simple, and teenage in terms of the director/writer. Let's set aside that Tarantino's movies never have any substance and are exercises in retro, gory, fetishist camp. Let's ignore that the story arc is off and the film is way too long. Also, that there are massive issues regarding all kinds of credibility. Which leaves the two main problems with this adolescent mess. The first is: what would you say about any film centered on two races of people, in which one race is, with a single exception, shown to be nothing but a vast collection of savage, cruel, stupid buffoons? That's what QT happily does to the white race in this, his attack on racism. Then, there's the blatant theft of Mel Brooks's 'Blazing Saddles' in the many n-word remarks geared for laughs and the idiot pre- Klansmen. Never was a big Brooks fan, but at least he never had the gall to pretend he was making a statement.",2013
10,"Absolutely loved every minute of this movie. Usually I'm not too crazy about Tarantino's movies, but this one is definitely the best one I've seen in a long time. The actors were picked perfectly. The overall experience of a movie is amazing. When we first went to watch it, I was a bit skeptical and thought I'd end up leaving an hour into the movie (it's a 3 hr movie), but it grabbed my attention from the very beginning and I didn't even wanna get up to go to the bathroom, afraid to miss something. I'm usually very particular about the movies, nothing can hardly satisfy me, but this one is definitely in the top 5. Soundtrack was perfect. When I got home, I've done some more research on it and loved it even more! Overall, I would highly recommend this film!",2012
5,"First I must say that I rarely write reviews. Most are already there to help a viewer decide whether to see the movie or not. An experienced moviegoer can always tell if the reviewer knows what he's talking about. But with Django unchained, that was such a horrible flick with sky high ratings, I just felt the urge to write down how disturbingly flawed and deeply deranged this movie is and not in a good way. It's been a long time since I have seen a good Tarantino movie. This era ended with his story and his part in Four Rooms. And after Kill Bill, things went downhill never to crawl back up. Every once in a while, Tarantino's flashy and expensive garbage is being spilled on theater screens all over the world, and the somewhat schizophrenic director surprisingly picks up even more fans along the dodgy way. I expected more from this movie, since I couldn't even sit through that dreary Inglorious bastards, so things had to get better. And yet, even though he had a perfect plot setting in a cruel time and place for black people in American history, he casted the still boyish looking I-must- be-the-bad-guy-in-that-movie DiCaprio who really gives his best to sell it but falls short, and you get yet another long term drug use flashback in a form of give-me-back-my-money drive-in movie, with an hour long boring film within a film - during the visit to Candie Land that starts with what can only be described as the first MMA fight ever held in a living room. In this openly racist movie, and not because of the excessive use of the n-word, whose star later promotes gun ban while making good money by shooting every white creature in this film that has sudden twists from serious to absurd, from grave to bizarre. Here we get a bad writing, bad music, bad casting, mediocre acting from an all-star cast and awful, awful direction. The dynamic sound makes you jump off your seat when someone slams the door on screen. How cheap is that? Well, the music was OK, but not for one playlist and certainly not for one western. You just can't mix Rio Bravo style songs and Elvis impersonator with modern rap music and get away with it. Unless your main character can spill buckets of blood with just one bullet or massacre crowds of armed rednecks just after practicing his gunslinger skills by shooting down a few bottles. We also see a drawer slide mounted Derringer save the day one time too many. We see black slaves speak fluent German. But this is a love story, and yet these extreme action scenes are the high tide here with tons of ketchup spills all around, with over the top gore that would make a B-slasher-movie look like British rom com, and the drab dramatic part will bore you to death and make you consider leaving the theater. Twice. What Quentin tries to achieve here, style wise, is the bleak mix of Gibson's The Passion of the Christ and Jesus Christ Superstar. But someone should've told him both movies are bad. Also, Samuel L. Jackson's pathetic make-up as well as his cartoonish role do not make things any better. I didn't expect to see Open Range, but this charade is a kind of rich gumbo, made out of all the bad ingredients from previous hyped Tarantino grindhouse style obsession movies or his dull WWII affirmative action fairy tale, that was oddly not enough spiced with finger licking good hot sauce from Leone, Hawks or Peckinpah, hence completely ruining this bad taste cinema and rendering it inedible. Now seeing these ratings, no wonder Gangnam style is the most viewed YT video ever. No wonder Hobit, Harry Potter, Batman, Spiderman and Lord of the Rings top the Best 250 list.",2013
1,"No one to blame but myself for giving this one a look; got just what I deserved, too. Unlike, say, GHOST DOG: WAY OF THE SAMURAI or THE MAN WITH THE IRON FISTS, DJANGO UNCHAINED doesn't seem as much like a filmmaker paying homage to what has come before as grave robbing. Sure, everybody does it, but the two aforementioned movies were done with a bit more genuine love, it seems, than this one. Scenes drag on interminably (THIS script won an Academy Award???), which is bad enough, but my biggest gripe has to be the PERFORMANCES. I don't know who the lead actor is (nor do I care), but he reminded me of the actors in movies like THE LOST SKELETON OF CADAVERA and SIX STRING SAMURAI: he's clearly an actor doing his lines- nothing more; we never, at any point in the pointless proceedings, feel like he IS the character. The scene where we see Django's djunk was more than a tad odd: the actor holding said djunk does so gently, and releases the djunk carefully. I'd be willing to bet that that was co-star Jaime Foxx's favorite day on the set... (Ah, to be cradled in the loving hands of a caring director...)",2013

2,"I'll get to the heart of the matter. ""Reservoir Dogs"" was spot on. It was a realistic (in terms of the outcome) yet highly stylized gangster film. It said to the viewer, ""I know you are expecting X, Y, and Z, but isn't it time you 'grew up' already? Do you want to see the same movie over and over again?"" 'Bad guys' do bad things and usually self-destruct in one way or another at a young age. We saw that no matter how hard one might try, you cannot polish a turd, as they say.",2013
1,Anyone finding this film actually enjoyable should seek immediate psychiatric help. The highly graphic depiction of dozens of revoltingly perverse and entirely gratuitous killings together with endless scenes of physical and psychological torture spread over nearly three hours of virtually plot less melodrama written only to facilitate this obscenity can only appeal to the mentally damaged. You have been warned.,2013
1,"Cant believe that he messed this up, had such high hopes. This wasn't even a movie, not even a Tarantino creation! Just some attempts for cool lines, cool shots and funny characters. DiCaprio, as excellent as always. Mr. Miami Vice, also good performance. The rest, especially Jackuel M. Samsonite (as my eloquent friends calls him) just wasted time and stole peoples money.",2013
10,"Quentin Tarantino's 8th film ""Django Unchained"" is one hell of a movie. A brutal, bloody, terrifying, hilarious and awe-inspiring western disguised as a buddy movie that is so great that if John Wayne and Sergio Leone were alive now, they would've approve of this movie. It's designed to shock you, polarize you, test you and maybe even surprise you. But let me clear on this: If you are not a fan of bloody violence and the running length of 165 minutes, see a shorter movie. But if you love to see what Tarantino can do with movies like this, then you're in for a treat. Set during slavery in 1858, the movie follows Django (Jamie Foxx), a slave who is found by a bounty hunter disguised as a dentist named Dr. King Schultz (The always reliable Christoph Waltz) who hires him as a bounty hunter and a free man to find the Brittle Brothers. After finding them and hunting them down at a plantation run by Big Daddy (a remarkable Don Johnson), they relax for the winter only for them to go on a mission to find and rescue Django's wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) who is owned by Calvin J. Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) a man who runs a plantation known as Candieland. He even has a renegade slave as a servant named Stephen (A nearly recognizable Samuel L. Jackson, hidden in makeup and some prosthetics), who will have a part to play in the last half of the movie. I think Quentin Tarantino has outdone himself once again. Being in the filmmaking game for 20 years now, you can't deny and even reject his style in what he is bringing to the screen (He also has a cameo in here as well). His dialogue is like reading a book that grabs you and makes you want to know what happens next. The look and scope of the film is magnificent, thanks to a brilliant Oscar-winning cinematographer Robert Richardson and the late production designer J. Michael Riva. The performances in this film are brilliant. Having won an Oscar for ""Ray"", Jamie Foxx continues with his breathtaking performances that wows us. Here as Django, he is certainly fearless, baring his soul (and body) playing a man who is free from slavery, but can't be free by the rules and limitations of slavery. Christoph Waltz looks like he was born to be a part of Tarantino's entourage after his Oscar-winning performance for ""Inglorious Basterds"". Here, once again he brings humor and vulnerability to Dr. King Schultz. Never before have I ever seen an actor go that far and doesn't go over-the-top like Leonardo DiCaprio. As Calvin Candie, DiCaprio is certainly Oscar-worthy as a man who runs a tight ship by running a place where male slaves fight to the death and female slaves are being prostitutes and he seems to be the kind of guy to like even though he is a villain and he speaks Tarantino's dialogue like a pro. When he has a scene in which he reveals three dimples from a skull that belongs to his father, he is literally terrifying. Kerry Washington is superb as Broomhilda and Samuel L. Jackson is the real scene-stealer. The supporting cast is great from Walton Goggins, Jonah Hill, Michael Bacall, Michael Parks, James Remar, Robert Carradine to a small cameo by Franco Nero. ""Django Unchained"" has a lot of things to say about slavery and how cruel it is. But at the same time, it provides the fact that if Tarantino rearranged history by shooting Adolf Hitler to a pulp while everything blows up at a movie theater, he can do it again by having a former slave whipping a man who used to beat him and his wife. Now, that's entertainment. This movie really is off the chain. It's not only one of the most captivating films of the year, it's one of the best films of the year. Go see it, it will be worth your time. Keep in mind though, there are characters, especially Django, Stephen, Candie and Schultz that uses the N-word numerous times in this movie. That seems relevant to the time period, don't ya think?",2012
1,"Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained is, among much else during its leisurely 165-minute running time, an adolescent male revenge fantasy about an omnipotent mass shooter wreaking carnage upon dozens of victims. I suspect the film would have appealed profoundly to the late Adam Lanza.",2013
10,"At first I didn't want to see this movie because of some political remarks made by Jamie Foxx and Samuel Jackson, two of my previously favorite actors, but Quintin Tarentino is a great director, so I broke down and saw it. Glad I did. This was absolutely one of the best movies of the year. Although Jamie Foxx has top billing, this film would not have been anywhere as good without Christoph Waltz. He stole every scene he was in. Brilliant acting and great comedic delivery. Leo was great too. Lots of blood, something expected in most of Quintins movies, but a great story. Also expect to hear the N word about 2000 times. Cristoph Waltz should get the Oscar for his performance. Should get nominated for best picture. This is absolutely a must see.",2012
1,"Imagine Quentin Tarantino is given the chance to direct ""Casablanca,"" a wonderful love story set against the backdrop of the beginning of WWII. It's an engaging story that pulls you into the plot and characters. You are on the edge of your seat near the end as Rick pulls into the airport to get Ilsa on the plane. Now, Major Stasser arrives and it looks as if all the best-laid plans will be thwarted, until . . . What's this? Rick pulls out a .45 and shoots Strasser in the head, blowing his guts and brains all over the airport. He tosses a shotgun to Victor who blows another Nazi in half. The pilot of the plane sees this and starts turning the plane toward Rick to mow him down with machine guns; but Rick takes out his bazooka and sends a missile into the plane, blowing it to smithereens. Rick turns to Ilsa, blood splattered all over his face and clothes and mutters, ""Get the F— outta here!"" He takes the cigarette out of his mouth and lights a fuse with it (who knows how it got there?) It burns down to multiple kegs of TNT and the entire airport blows up as Rick and Ilsa walk slowly (of course, slowly!) away. ""MF—ers had it coming."" Rick says as the screen fades to black. My! What a heart-warming story!",2014

1,"This movie is an absolute, total, pitiful, dismal, ridiculous waste of time. I cannot possibly believe that anyone enjoys this movie. There is nothing meaningful and important, and the only reaction I have after watching this is the reaction to punch the face of the person nearest to me. I cannot relate to the characters whatsoever, and the story is maybe the weakest thing since my mother's homemade teriyaki sauce. If someone forced me to watch this again, I would gouge my eyeballs out with a spoon to avoid seeing it. Seriously, it's that bad. Never watch this movie. Ever. I cannot believe that there are people who view this as the best movie of all time. I know someone who has watched it at least 12 times and claims that it is her favorite movie. She thinks it is impacting and wonderful. The only impact that was associated with this movie to me was the impact of my fist smashing the disk into several bite sized pieces. I will never watch this movie again as long as I live.",2013
4,"This movie is a big letdown. Here you have a good cast, a lovely college setting, good costumes and camera-work and great music. I feel the problem is the characters and the script. Intentionally or not, the characters come across as very white-bread and narrow minded. At first I though they were denigrating anyone who was ""different"" as a way of highlighting that such behaviour is wrong. But actually I think the script is genuinely making fun of anyone who's not a blonde bimbo or jock. Anna Kendrick is sweet but too serious for the lead role of Beca. And her character is too dark. The plot is air thin - guys you've got to give the audience something a bit meatier to chew on. But all that seems to happen is that a group of shrill young women stand around messing up their rehearsals. The End. Great teen movies like Bring It On and Ten Things I Hate About You have some depth and meaning and feeling to balance the goofiness. This movie is pure sugar and that's not good for you.",2015

We were probably the oldest people in the audience which ranged down to younger teens but everyone, regardless of age, was laughing and having a grand time. Much less schmaltzy and self-serious than Glee, but wonderful vocals and dancing and personality. You can't help but fall in love with the hilariously quirky characters, especially Rebel Wilson as the irrepressible Fat Amy, Elizabeth Banks as Gail, the sexually frustrated female announcer, and Hanna Mae Lee as Lilly, the wackadoo who releases the most shocking comments in a voice that barely exceeds a murmur. Fun, feel-good and highly entertaining.",2012

3,"I was never planning on seeing this particular movie after seeing the unfortunate trailer. However, I had heard good things about it from people who's opinions I used to trust. I won't make that mistake again. Pitch Perfect was awesomely terrible. It began innocently enough, but then it quickly devolved into a mash-up of just about every single cliché one can fathom. It has the loner girl who doesn't want to try new things but then she gets involved with a group and she has friends, yay! The girl falls for the guy, but she screws it all up, but don't worry they get back together in the end. The group starts out terrible, but then because of the new girl with fresh ideas they step up and win it all! So many eye rolls in one film!",2012

1,"Oh what to say about this garbage of a movie? Oh yea I wish I were be able to give this movie a 0/10 but due to IMDb I have to give at least a 1. That is how awful and stupid this movie is. The only 2 good things about this movie are the Universal logo and when this movie finally over. Although I haven't really sat through this piece of crap I'm still giving it my review y'all could hate on me but I don't care. Okay, so yea I've only sat through like half hour or so but I had to turn off the TV because it was really stupid and unrealistic in terms of college and probably the worst movie of 2012 that I've seen. This movie is not funny it's stupid and inaccurate when it comes to being in college. The students in the movie are not even carrying any books around, so what do students do in the movie? Do they learn anything? Another thing, the selection of music. The selection of music in this movie is absolutely horrible, I hate modern pop it's really stupid and overrated and they only played that in this movie and with People in this movie messing it up even more now it's even more annoying now and then they try to rap to a throwback from the 80s or 90s, wow really why? That's my jam there and they just messed it up with their annoying ass auto tuned singing voices. Plus this movie is not funny it's dumb, annoying and overrated, critics why are you giving this piece of crap so much credit that it does not deserve at ALL? That goes for people too that suck this movie's dick. Seriously the score for this movie is too high, a 7.2 is way too high for this movie . I'm not even gonna bother finishing this movie, half hour is already a lot of time wasted on this bull-crap, okay Fat Amy is not funny at all people I didn't laugh at her jokes once, because there stupid and unfunny to me and all the rest of the humor in this damn movie is dumb and unfunny. I do not recommend this movie, If you like stupid ass overrated movies or crap like Glee or anything like that you'll like this one but otherwise if you do have common sense, do not waste your valuable hard working time, your time is much much more important than this movie. I would NEVER pay money to even get this on DVD. So yea people don't watch this movie this movie sucks",2013

I scored free tickets to a Denver Screening awhile back and was just going to have my wife and 13 year old daughter go , but I watched the trailer and really thought Anna Kendrick was terrific in 50/50 and very good in Up in the Air so I thought, what the heck, I'm going too. Was I glad that I did. I laughed like crazy and loved the a capella singing. This film is really raunchy and just skirts around an R rating several times, but it is just so fun.",2012
1,"Lots of fans could hardly wait for the sequel to come out, and now that it's here, I went back and watched PP again to see if I missed something. Nope, all that junk is still there. I was hoping to see a musical, but a vapid teen/college comedy showed up instead with a sprinkling of ""music"" in it. Most of the major roles were occupied by actors closer to 30 than college age at the time the movie was made. The music is spotty, at best, and the lip-syncing/dubbing is terrible. A lot of ""fat girls are funny"" humor involving Rebel Wilson's character (can she actually do comedy, or just Funny Fat Girl stuff?) And when they resort to vomit humor more than once, you know a movie is short on writing talent. The only bright spot is Anna Kendrick, and her solo with that coffee mug. I can hardly wait for PP2 to come out - - - at the $2 video rental box, it's a sequel I can wait for....",2015
2,"Once again, I find myself in the minority, but aca-believe it - I didn't enjoy Pitch Perfect. ",2013
1,I watched this on cable last night. My friend who suggested we watch it told me she'd heard from many that it was very funny. I did not think it was funny at all. We watched about half of it (maybe the good parts were in the second half?) Doubtful. ,2012
3,"Most of the people I saw Pitch Perfect with truly enjoyed it. They laughed and clapped and booed at me when I expressed my disgust. For many, this movie will definitely be enjoyable. Make no mistake, that does not make it any less of an awful movie.",2012
9,"Take Bring It On, Glee (not in the icky cheesy way, but because there's singing involved, the good kind), Mean Girls, and add some quick-witted, sharp-tongued dialogue and commentary, and you have the funniest of movies. ",2012
4,"With the everywhere-talked-about release of the sequel to this 2012 movie, I thought it was high time finally give the original a watch. It proved not a good idea. The humor in here basically includes the level of vomiting, terrible word plays about penetration and menstrual cycles. This is a 105-minute movie directed by Jason Moore and written by Kay Cannon based on Mickey Rapkin's novel. Cannon returned for the sequel, Moore did not. Instead they went with Elizabeth Banks as director and she has a common past with Cannon, who is mostly famous for writing ""30 Rock"" episodes. I quite like this television series, so i was really baffled how bad her writing for this film here was. Anna Kendrick is an actress I actually quite like. She has charisma, looks and talent, a combination which is not too common these days. And she tried her best so that her performance could make up for many other flaws with this movie, but in the end it just wasn't enough. The script is just too bad. They start the film with giving Beca's main rival in the group a moment as embarrassing as it gets, so we could dislike her right away and prefer Kendrick's character. Rebel Wilson is like a younger Melissa McCarthy with the difference that she is entirely unfunny. I mentioned bad plays on words earlier and there are more of these. The repeated use of ""aca-scuse me"" was a negative highlight. Another flaw with this film was the ridiculous idea to include a guidebook according to which the singers were not allowed to have relationships with the guys from the rivaling men-only singers group.",2015
3,"Another reviewer stated: ""...Rebel Wilson plays an amazing part and has given the Mean Girls script a run for their money..."" I immediately felt the need to speak up and say that this movie is not even in the same category as Mean Girls. Mean Girls is meant to be ironic and satiric. Pitch Perfect was meant to be a plain ol' comedy, but whatever, that's beside the point.",2013
9,"""Pitch Perfect"" is basically ""Bring It On"", but with a cappella singing groups instead of cheerleadersand it's also a million times funnier. Directed by Jason Moore and adapted by Kay Cannon from Mickey Rapkin's novel, ""Pitch Perfect"" tells the story of Beca (played by Anna Kendrick) an aspiring DJ attending Barden University, who's hobbies include seclusion, nonconforming and listening to Mashups (which kind of makes her a conformist). In an attempt to have Beca become more socially active, her father (who is also a professor at the University) urges her to join a club on campus. But upon perusing each club (especially the glee clubs) she quickly decides that the loner lifestyle is far less humiliating. That is, until a rather awkwardly nude run-in with one of the members of the The Bellas, an all-girl a cappella group on campus that sings nothing but Ace of Base. And since The Bellas are coming off of an embarrassing loss at the previous year's singing competition, Beca, as well as a multitude of other ""a ca-losers""; including Fat Amy (as advertized) and Lilly, the girl who can apparently speak no higher than a whisper, are asked to try out in a desperate hope that a group of misfits could be just the thing that sends the conservative Bellas all the way to the finals of the national Glee-esque competition. And if this doesn't sound generic enough, there is also a love story subplot centered around Beca and a guy who looks shockingly like Dane Cook. OK, so if this sounds like every teen flick that you've ever seen, about a misunderstood misfit who ends up helping the popular kids (that were mean to her in the beginning of the movie) win their something-or-other championship/tournament, only to discover that in the end that they are all the same no matter their social standing, then that is only because, from synopsis alone, ""Pitch Perfect is exactly that. But before you write this dark horse off, let me just say that due to a sharply satirical script and a surprisingly hilarious, eccentric and immensely engaging cast, which include the likes of Brittany Snow, Hana Mae Lee, Rebel Wilson (as Fat Amy) Skylar Astin and Anna Kendrick, giving a performance which not only solidifies herself as a true leading lady in any genre, but also as the new Kristen Bell, but with talent, ""Pitch Perfect"" does elevate itself far above the mundane-ness of your everyday teen comedy. In fact, from the non-stop laughs, to the quite satirical teenage dialogue, to the perfectly hilarious ""Best in Show""-esque banter from Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins, who play the two commentators of the national a cappella competition, ""Pitch Perfect"", aside from a curiously abrupt ending, works on EVERY level; even in its rarest of sappy moments.",2012
10,"I absolutely loved this movie. Saw an advanced screening and the entire theater was laughing and clapping throughout the movie! Refreshing to see a comedy and musical combo. A lot like Glee (minus the cheesy factor) mixed with witty comedy like in Bridesmaids and other modern popular comedies. Great casting! Any college girl is bound to love it. This is a movie even my mom would enjoy. It held my interest throughout and i think it was well produced. My boyfriend even enjoyed the comedy aspect of it! A great girls night out movie choice or even a date night movie. I feel like overall everybody loved it, I definitely did. I hope this movie earns the recognition it deserves. Its going to be a hit among young audiences like myself!",2012
5,"The problem of this movie is that there are some very good scenes and some horrible ones. Let's have a look at it, shall we?",2013
7,"This new comedic musical is right on pitch. Anna Kendrick plays Beca, a student at Barden University whose dream is to move to LA and become a DJ. Beca is uninterested in college, to say the least. Her father is a professor at her school and he advises her to join clubs to get more involved. Beca starts to work at the school radio station along with her admirer, Jesse (Skylar Astin).",2012
1,"I simply love acapella music, I might be actually interested in a soundtrack if the songs sampled are actually full-length.",2013
8,"I didn't want to like it. Despite what you may think I don't want to like movies like this . I hate myself for it. But there's such an overwhelming charm when things are executed just right and I just can't help it. Pitch Perfect centers on Becca played the emerging star Anna Kendrick (in a role which will solidify her status if it its as big as it deserves ) a freshman at college. Her father is a professor and she's angsty and rebellious. After a brief set up we enter the unknown world of acapella singing, Which is singing with no instruments. Apparently a huge thing at this college and we meet different groups there well 2 mostly the troublemakers an all male group that always slays the competition and the Bellas who churn out the same old fashioned nonsense and are recovering from a year that didn't end well to say the least. After some persuasion Becca joins the Bellas looking to add some of her much needed zest to liven up the competition.I'm sure you can guess what happens and it's no lie that the film is formulaic in that way. However, the approach to the material is what differentiates it. It's handled with an original, saucy, smart originality. it doesn't downplay it's focus but instead celebrates it in all it's corny glory. The film takes a little getting used to but about half way through i was so sold on all the wonderful characters and the films undeniable charm. Filled with exciting musical numbers and solid performances from Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson as Fat Amy, the adorable Skylar Kenstin as Beccas love interest and so many others Pitch perfect is something truly special. Not to say t's flawless it's a little amateur in spots and Brittany Snow's character feels a little confusing. But it's easy to overlook the small stuff when the film is so entertaining.",2012
1,"How this got rated higher than Mean Girls is beyond me. At least Mean Girls managed to be raw without losing its class. Pitch Perfect was so desperate for cheap laughs its cringe worthy. I actually watched it with a group of friends, one actually fell asleep and the others weren't laughin, or at least not at the movie. First of all, (if i remember correctly) a bunch of misfits join a choir to go against a rival group. Okay, where did they even come up with this idea? A UNIVERSITY choir so desperate for members they pick ALL weird girls. But I digress, thats not the worst. Just the immaturity of the plot all throughout. Rivalries like that don't exist, normally people move on and don't dwell on the fact they were teased. Who are they to them anyway? Its just a bunch of pranks and childish competition from adults. And if Anna Kendricks character was supposed to be an average boring girl then they did a perfect job with her. The humor was just gross, the girl throwing up and then having the whistle land in there ughh I almost puked. And the Asian girl saying ""I ate my twin in the womb"" thats not funny! Or relatable. This is what I mean by ""desperate"". Then the scene with the puppets singing ""F. U. F U very much"" OH HO HO is funny becas she said eff you OH! I cannot quote anything except for fat amy talking about her nickname, whereas i can quote almost every scene in mean girls ""you go Glen Coco!"". There's not that many funny girls' movies out there so there's not much to compare it to. But this movie further emphasizes why there's not that many funny girls' movies out there...The only reason this got a one is because of the effort in the music and choreography. If you like fart jokes and pop songs then this is the perfect movie for you.",2014
