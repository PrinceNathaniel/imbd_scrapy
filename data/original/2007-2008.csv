9,"The brilliance is all in the subtext. There are many hilarious moments that are only funny if you've been paying attention and understand where the character is coming from. There are also many tragic moments that would pass you by if you didn't know what came before. Many lines have double or even triple meanings. Watch this from the beginning, with a friend. Believe me, you will want to discuss each episode afterward to figure out some of the nuances of what happened.",2009
9,"This is a perfect show in every sense. The opening credits & animated intro are themselves works of art, and the creative direction makes the series so visually exquisite that you can't take your eyes off the screen even for a moment lest you miss one of the many perfect vignettes. The haunting opening music sets the stage for masterful sound design, ranging from each episode's musical selections to the subtlest of ambient sounds. The camera-work is nothing short of stunning; it loves each character and makes even the background action interesting. Talented cast and every character is watchable & believable.",2010
10,"I also am utterly bemused to see so many negative comments on this show. I haven't taken to a TV drama so much since 'Our Friends in the North' (UK only I think) For those who seem to think the show is about pointing out the improved morals of the 21st century, or don't catch the story lines as being evolved enough, or think the characters shallow - I'm afraid you're missing the (beautifully painted) picture completely.",2009
10,"I must admit I'm more likely to be shocked how many users find this drama dull.I remember the night I had the chance to gaze at one of episodes for couple of minutes.Betty posing for a coke ad didn't seem charming or appealing to me at all, I changed the channel...",2009
8,"The first episode of Mad Men honestly represents the drinking, smoking, sexist fifties, a time when Madison Avenue's attitude and control permeated our entire culture, including one international political blunder after another, a time before anyone ever heard of political correctness. Gays were still in the closet, women slept their way to wherever they wanted to go, and advertising executives ruled the world. Everyone smoked because we all just looked so damn good doing it.",2007
8,"The characters go around completely oblivious to how pointless their lives are. They think they have perfect marriages-- they don't. Perfect jobs-- nope. Perfect health even though they constantly smoke and drink-- nope. We can look back and see how phony it all was-- the advertising, the plastic homes and lives, and the social niceties and expectations. And here's the punchline-- it's US! TODAY! And that's the brilliance of the show. Today we are the same with different clothes and cars. We are jaded, full of irony and smarm, and believe we are self-aware. Imagine how a TV show (hologram show?) will look back at the sad folks of 2007 45 years from now. We tune out, blame others, scan the internet for porn, buy $5 coffee, and still can't fix the health care system. Apart from the amusement of looking into a 47 year-old mirror, the show gives us tremendous writing, acting, set decoration and drama. Let me re-emphasize my favorite part of the show-- set decoration. Kudos all around at the insistence of having the look of every scene strike me as true and accurate to the nth degree. I have watched each of the first episodes three times each. I love it!",2007
2,"Spoilers!!! Okay, I'm just going to say it. Don Draper is awful. He is a scumbag. A lot of people praise Mad Men for the ""complexity"" of this character, but in all honesty he bas got to be one of the worst characters in television. Not only is he totally okay with betraying his wife several times, no he also has the audacity to act out if someone calls him out on it (the comedian from season 2). Also he is fine with telling an emotional story (about his family which he has no empathy for) just to sell a product (The Kodak Carousel). After the divorce from his wife he continues to be terrible. Remember he is quite passive as his increasingly psychotic wife ruins the life of their children. He must have noticed something (his daughter running away from home to be with him or her being forced to visit a psychiatrist). But to his credit he ain't the only horrid character. Nobody has positive traits. The story stays the same. The only somewhat likable person who develops throughout the story is Peggy and that is unfortunately not enough to hold up seven seasons.",2016
8,"Women were objects, the steno pool was a sexist source of jokes, and the ad men were (they thought) at the top of their game. They had the world on a string and all was well in America. Eisenhower was brilliant, Communism was evil, Tobacco was good, and drinking in the office was just creative brainstorming.",2007
1,"Let me make one thing perfectly clear--Mad Men is not The Sopranos. Now, with that out of the way, I think I can give an honest opinion about this overrated show. Yes, it's overrated, and it's overly hyped as well.",2010
4,"The fanatic (note ""fan"" in fanatic), unthinking embrace by many viewers of this soap opera(Yes, it is a night time sudser in the same sink with All My Children) and its characters is only explicable in terms of a puerile taste for soft porn and titillation, caused, not by pretty females in the cast, but by all the booze consumed, the fags smoked and the obvious sensual bonanza for gays and hetero women when Don Draper takes off his hat. Very sexy, very virile--only one so tedious as Don could be known best for the way he takes off his hat.",2010
4,"Hailed as being as good as West Wing and the Sopranos I was drawn in to go and see this show. Alas it's not doing it for me. Apart from Joan Holloway there is no character I like. They're not funny, mysterious, smart or anything else interesting. Big hero Don Draper is not my kind of guy, too shallow and his back story too dull and predictable (I don't like Tony Soprano either but he's interesting too watch, as is the world around him). His wife is even worse. She is a spoiled waste with no other quality then being beautiful. Perhaps badly written as a quite desperation character caught in the times (60s)but she's hopelessly inadequate as a character (what would Cybil Shephard in her prime have done, more wit perhaps or a bit more depth or at least captivating). These people are supposed to be smart but not even in the current season (3) I have seen them do anything smart or say anything intelligent (this is certainly no West Wing level, scripting, it is not even on par with the final WW season). Actually the book by Ogilvie on Advertisement (mentioned in the series) is better written then any of this. Basically I have watched 3 seasons of soap opera with better sets and lightning, but certainly not more intriguing. If this was life at the beginning of the swinging sixties i'm glad my parents turned out all right.",2009
9,"I'm in love with this new show. As noted in previous comments (correcting other comments), this show takes place in 1960, and not the 50s. I find the criticism of this show funny--it's a television show, folks. I don't think it's meant to be 100% accurate. If it were, it would be pretty humdrum, imo.",2007
5,"OK i know im in a minority not to think this series is genius but i am entitled to be wrong lol. The production values and attention to detail are superb, the representation of the style of dress, technology, and architecture are just gorgeous, but the story lines and plot have typical soap opera values which could easily crop up in eastenders or coronation street,both of which i find dull and boring, this is equally dull, it is so banal in its plot lines that all it has going for it is its good looks. Style over substance has never been more apt, my partner watches it and freely admits it is only for the clothes and style that she does so, otherwise its not very interesting, since the fashion angle has very limited appeal to me there is nothing i can find here to make me stick with it, the women are lovely to look at but i really need more than eye candy to maintain interest.",2012
6,"I wanted to watch Mad Men as it was recommended in a lot of websites on articles along the lines of: ""Shows you should binge watch"" The IMDb rating of 8.7 proved to further bolster that point. ",2015
7,I bought the DVD of Season One based on sheer buzz from friends.,2009
3,"Like many who wrote sharp critiques against Avatar the movie, I found much of the same parallels between love of a well art directed movie and a well art directed TV show.",2011
1,The majority of the reviewers are not from the USA and male. There is a lot of talk about its hidden depths and its realism. How it breathes life into a fascinating period of USA high flyers.,2015
8,"At first, this show intrigued me. It gave a glimpse into an era long gone. The set and acting were both superb.",2015
4,"I agree that the series lacks depth. I, myself being in advertising and working on Tobacco products, can easily mesh with the Characters: i.e. client-creative-client service relationships. My favorite scene though was from first season, Let me just say ""Carousel"" If every show was as good as that presentation- I wouldn't feel like I was wasting my life away... BTW why does Betty always talk so slow, it seems like she is on something.",2009
3,"People kept telling me that they loved this show so I ended up getting the DVDs of the first season. I watched the entire series, hoping it would grow on me. I have to say though that I was bored at the beginning and I was bored at the end. ",2009
1,"Mad Men is poorly written, it spews continually lackluster dialogue, and it struggles with one boring plot line after another. The show boasts quite the cast, but this only underscores how poorly the writers have done in utilizing the talent at their disposal. When it first came out I was intrigued, and subsequently watched several episodes, but it didn't take long to come to the realization that there is simply no ""there"" there. Short of the somewhat unique premise of the series, there is absolutely nothing about this show that warrants the attention it is getting. Are people really so shallow that they fall for this sophomoric, gimmicky drivel? When I heard that it was actually winning awards I couldn't even believe by ears. Mad Men is every bit as trite and pathetic as our modern movies and music. Style over substance, nothing more.",2010
2,"... because producers seem to think that just because they portray this stylish era, they can be sloppy about the plot. One of the most frustrating things I found is that many interesting plot threads are started and are never followed up upon later (or just not enough). A lot of scenes could be just easily left out since they don't contribute to the understanding of the characters or the plot (seriously, do we really need to see Don taking a long walk across the office or smoking leisurely at a restaurant with nothing else going on?). Instead, producers could spend more time on good dialogs, because the dialogs in this show are trite for the most part.",2009
4,"Ocean Thirteen's slick credit sequence, highlighting Brad Pitt in all his movie star glory and letting us all know that Soderbergh and his camera are up for some glossy fun, gets the heart racing in anticipation of a slick, sly heist caper on par with #1 and superior to #2.",2007
6,"I went to see this movie with only one expectation, surely it cant be as bad as the second film. On this front i was greatly pleased as the sense of smugness surrounding twelve has been completely lost. The only real problem i had was that after the film finished i really struggled to remember anything particularly about it.",2007
7,"So they're back, for a third time, after Ocean's Eleven in 2001 and Ocean's Twelve in 2004. First they took out three of Terry Benedict's (Andy Garcia) Las Vegas casinos at one go with a smart and clever plan in Eleven, then they had to pay it all back with interest to Benedict in Twelve by staging a different theft, now in Thirteen the team of eleven are back to casino stealing with a little help from again, Benedict.",2007
8,Normally the sequel to a movie is a let down. Especially if the first part was really good. I think that's what's happened with Ocean's 12 for many but l hope this doesn't mean that they won't be watching '13'.,2007
7,"Have you ever watched a film while multi-tasking? Well if you have, you should do it again but this time put on Ocean's Thirteen. I would not describe myself as a fan of the Oceans' movies but I have pretty much enjoyed all of them. In light of that though this is the worst one of the series.",2009
10,"I was a huge fan of Ocean's Eleven, it was smart, witty, funny and in my opinion the best remake I have ever seen. The great cast and the smart dialogue just made it a pleasure to watch, leading my expectations to reach phenomenal levels before seeing its follow up, Ocean's Twelve. So perhaps that is why Ocean's Twelve seemed such a let down, my expectations were to high. As a result of this originally my expectations for Ocean's Thirteen were horribly low, I contemplated not even seeing it at one point. However after re watching Ocean's Eleven, I decided to give it a chance, perhaps Soderbergh at made an effort this time, perhaps it would reclaim the glory of the original movie. Thankfully it has not only reclaimed my respect for the series, but also produced, in my eyes, the best entry so far. The return to Las Vegas has also seen a return of a great script, a plot that is followable, decent jokes and also just a sense of fun that Ocean's Twelve was sorely lacking. In many ways this makes up for the mistake that was the past movie, this is the sequel we should have had. In actual fact, apart from maybe a couple of details, this movie has next to nothing following on from the second movie. This is a good thing as it allows more people to see the quality first movie and then not have to worry about seeing the horrific second one before seeing the best of the series.",2007
2,"I've never been a fan of the Ocean's series. I saw Ocean's 11 & found it to be a drab affair without a good script .George Clooney was the only guy who held that movie together. This is why I chose to avoid Ocean's 12. But when Ocean's 13 was about to release, I was really excited because it had Al Pacino in it. Alas! Even he could not save this movie.",2007
2,The Ocean (Clooney) plan is to take down Willy Bank (Pacino) who forces his one-time casino owner-partner (Gould) to give everything up to Bank.,2007
9,"Danny Ocean and his Eleven are back in Las Vegas. This time, Danny tries to talk sense into Willie Bank, the owner of a series of highly rated ""5 Diamonds"" hotels who double-crossed one of Eleven, Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould), on a hotel deal causing the man a heart-attack and coma-like state. After the ruthless and arrogant Bank suggests that Reuben ""rolls over and dies"", Danny and his team decide to take the Bank's stunning new casino out of business on the big opening night. ",2007
9,They are back and now there are 13...,2007
6,"Since I am a fan of the first two movies I expected a funny and thrilling film. What carried the viewer through its predecessors (great retro design, music etc.) now isn't enough for a really good movie. The story itself could be summed up too quickly. The preparation for the big thievery starts almost from the beginning of the film and it's justification is really poor. What can be really enjoyed are the colorful visuals and a bunch of stars that seem to enjoy themselves. All this prevents a worse vote. To me it seems that Hollywood is running out on ideas at the moment. Sequels are obviously attractive from a financial point of view but bear the risk that they are produced and conceived not careful enough.",2007
6,"Again the Danny Ocean bunch with the biggest heist of all . Reuben (Elliot Gould) suffers a heart attack for a treason and as revenge Danny Ocean pull off a plan introducing the schemes for a new robbery venture and gathering the eclectic group for a new caper . This time , Benedict (Andy Garcia) agrees with Ocean backed by his motley gang to execute it , the group is the same people (Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Scott Cahan, Bernie Mac, Casey Affleck , Carl Reiner, Qin) .

We never met a band like Ocean's thirteen . This rendition gets one of the greatest entertainment of the trilogy .",2007
4,"I was waiting for ""Ocean's Thirteen"" with a lot of excitement since George Clooney is one of my favourite actors but I was absolutely disappointed when finally watching the movie. Although the actors played very well, the plot was weird and it was hard to follow the story. To make it even worse, although it was said that the ""job"" was literally impossible everything seemed to be too easy and just a matter of money to be spent. The audience never had the impression that Danny and his buddies really had to struggle for their mission's accomplishment.",2007
3,"Looks and rolling of the eyes, Oprah and all the rest. This guys are very questionable and I don't mean because they steal. They steal in a very civilized way, almost with a prim kind of detachment. George Clooney, which I love, is starting to look oldish and very feminine. was this on purpose? Brad Pitt is always chewing something and is always so close to Clooney that they could become a duo if not a pair. Matt Damon tries a nose but it won't have the repercussions of Nicole Kidman's. Here the nose is strictly four laughs and it almost succeeded. Ellen Barkin looks smashing for a woman of ""her age"" and rich, she looks rich. Andy Garcia walks through it well dressed and trying to cling on to something. His Oprah interview got me to laugh a little bit. Al Pacino, well, I don't know what to say. I'm not saying he should be angry with his director but should sue the Director Of Photography. At times he looked like my late aunt Margo. What was that? Listen, I'm not being facetious. I'm just treating the movie the way the movie treated me. Moronically. I got tired of seeing this rich actors make more money. This was my last Ocean, no matter how many more they throw my way.",2007
7,"Just got back from from watching this and I'd have to say it's probably the best film I've seen in about six months. It definitely cheered me up after that disappointing Spiderman sequel. Don't get me wrong Ocean's 13 is not quite as good as 11 but it's still a good watch (Big improvement on the second one). The absence of Catherine Zeta Jones and Julia Roberts was a bit of a surprise, but I doubt their presence would have improved the film greatly. The addition of the great Al Pacino was definitely a big positive and as usual he played his role well and brought a lot to the film. The action sequence were well done, there are quite a few funny segments in the film involving some pretty hilarious disguises. The camera work and techniques are excellent. The story was a big improvement on O-12 but I agree with what I read in another review, that it definitely lacked the suspense of the first one. Nothing really happened where the whole plan went to cock and they had to quickly come up with an even more ingenious plan or else all was doomed. It was more like, oh no somethings broken, what do we do? I know, lets buy a replacement, Phew! Apart from that, everyone played their roles fantastically, with the exception of maybe Eddie Izzard who I think was a little off character, which I found disappointing because I really enjoyed his short part in the O-12. In summary I'd say; Room for improvement, still a really good film, definitely worth the price of admission.",2007
5,"Ocean's Thirteen was better than Ocean's 12. That isn't saying much since O12 was horrible. O13 was a tad better. Al Pacino helped by creating a character who was believable and entertaining. Ellen Barkin was terribly miscast. Her role would have been played better by some riper, younger actress. Brad Pitt look very please with himself and George Clooney avoided being too smug. Neither were all that entertaining and the movie focused on them most of the time. I thought the movie was slow. The caper consisted of solving a series of problems in rigging all of the gambling at Al Pacino's casino. The rigging was accomplished with a bunch of unexplained, magical devices. It felt more like Wily E. Coyote's Acme products than actual plausible products. The mine digging machine was ridiculous. It was way too fantastical to be believed. The rigging of the diamond prize was clever and believable. The trouble with sequels is that the characters are not developed further but are just referred to in a kind of role shorthand. The whole screenplay was a shorthand version of a caper movie. The Ocean story is that these really clever guys have to rob an entire casino against great odds which they accomplish with neato devices and tricks. This movie followed the outline but failed to develop the robbery techniques beyond magical Acme devices. How did pouring powder in the dice raw material actually make the dice roll over by pressing another magic device? It wasn't engineering it was magic. The movie required one to suspend too much belief in reality to make the caper work. A drilling machine in the middle of a major city, that breaks and has to be replaced in a day, and bores a huge tunnel under the city with no one noticing. Come on! It would take months for a team of engineers to accomplish the task of just getting the machine started. The caper just didn't work. The ensemble casting wasn't an ensemble. It was three stars with other people around. The acting wasn't terrible but just egocentric. Wait for a dark and stormy night and rent it.",2007
1,Even an all-star cast can't save this misery of a movie.,2008
4,"Too much talk, no action, no humor, no good enough plot and not big enough ending. You keep watching and expecting something really big to happen to make a climax, but suddenly you realize it's the ending. A real disappointment concerning the big names involved and the great acting.",2007
3,"Everyone who's buying a ticket for this movie (like me), obviously liked the two first. And if you did that- well, you still will be disappointed.",2007
3,"We went with a group of 8 people to watch the movie and all of us were disappointed. Why? Despite the fact that some great actors come together, the story line is extremely predictable and boring. No real surprises and the characters are so one-dimensional that it feels more like watching a cartoon movie. The director missed a huge opportunity getting all those big actors together. But it seems that screen-play just did not have enough substance for 90 minutes. What I found frustrating was that at some points the story line was not logical. This is a typical movie one should watch on a trip in the plane or get it from the video store to watch it at home. Do not waste a beautiful Saturday night with your friends in the movie theater watching this movie.",2007
3,Who would let ANY of these guys into a casino ever again? Nobody. Who would be able to get a Chunnel tunneling machine beneath the Vegas strip undetected? Nobody. Those facts in and of themselves make this movie a sham. But willfully suspending disbelief of that- O's 13 has plenty else to make it implausible in the extreme. And plenty less to make it fun to watch.,2007
1,"Last Friday I went out with a friend of mine. He fall asleep. I was watching the movie and thought: 'Can anybody tell me what is this about?' The characters were like robots, there happened nothing. Nothing to laugh, nothing to cry, no tension at all. The movie was boring. The clichés could be thought by a child. The hotel ranking man couldn't entertain me at all. Unbelievable that a top actor like Al Pacino decided to cooperate with such a bad movie. He can perform much better. Hollywood, please stop this awful Ocean's experiment, go and make exiting movies please!! Make thrilling movies that make you sit at the point of your chair!",2007
6,"When I visited the Warner Studios in Los Angeles last year, my family and me had a tour; the guide was explaining to us that most of the stages, at that time, were being used for the movie ""Ocean's 13"". I recognized the Bank Casino in the film; I saw it when they were constructing it. My point is that if they were using all these stages for one movie, it involved big money, big production. Was all of this money unnecessarily spent? No, because they're getting it back with interests.",2007
10,People did not like this movie for a simple reason: too negative. I can understand that this movie is so depressing in so may ways. ,2008
9,"The year I was born was the same year Predator and Robocop came out. When I was finally old enough to appreciate films, Little Nicky was in theaters. I know, believe me, I know; rocky start. And often I would watch older films, or specials on older films, and be dazzled. You know the ones. Remember when they made Spartacus? Remember sitting in the movies and watching Gregory Peck play Atticus Finch in To Kill A Mockingbird? Remember the first time you heard ""I could've been a contender"" through theater speakers? Well I sure as hell don't. But I'll tell you what, now I feel somewhat caught up. Let's begin with the obvious. Daniel Day Lewis. No one's arguing about this. The man is a veritable God among ants on the screen. He takes his role by the reigns and I don't doubt him for a second. In fact, at times, I was downright afraid of the man. Lewis gives what is easily, EASILY the best performance of the past five years. But let's get serious about it. Lewis' Daniel Plainview is the most convincing, awe-inspiring, and downright mortifying character to take the big screen that I can remember. Here, perfectly in his element and at his best, Lewis could go toe to toe with Brando and Kinski, playing a part that oozes enough skill and pathos to earn him a place among Hollywood's, and perhaps the world's, greatest performances of all time. He gives those of us who missed out on the craft, depth of character, and technique of classic cinema a chance to admire a tour de force portrayal of a memorable, identifiable, and completely despicable character, and it's so damned refreshing that I can't stop singing the man's praises. Paul Dano has been taking a lot of fire for this whole thing. People continue to spout their disapproval of the film's casting, saying that Dano has no business rivaling the seasoned Lewis on the screen. Listen, lay down your swords a minute and consider the obvious. The guy was cast opposite the performance of the decade, he's not going to outshine Lewis and you'd be crazy to expect him to. In fact, I think that he and Lewis' back-and-forths are the films highlights, as we see the juxtaposition not only in the characters themselves, but also in their acting techniques. And the cinematography? Welcome to the old days of film. The glory days of Hollywood. Anderson gives us one of the most beautifully shot and directed films in recent memory, truly at the top of his craft on this one. Every moment feels more epic than the last, until the film becomes such a towering cinematic spectacle that the end leaves the viewer exhausted. It's truly an experience not to be missed. Yeah, we missed out on A Street Car Named Desire. And Casablanca isn't gonna be in theaters again any time soon. But in the meantime, There Will Be Blood is just about as good, and will likely haunt our generation as much as the Hollywood studio epics of the past...",2008
10,"The world of cinema has seen and marveled a plethora of phenomenal performers, who over the years have entranced billions of viewers globally with their guile, grandeur, subtlety, eloquence and idiosyncrasy, but I dare say that none of their performances can match Daniel Day-Lewis' portrayal of Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood, for sheer ruthlessness, panache, eloquence and cheek. Being the chameleon that he truly is, Daniel Day-Lewis incredibly musters up all his prodigious talent as an actor to conjure up his misanthropic alter ego, Daniel Plainview, whose perpetually smirked face bolstered by his malice filled eyes makes him one of the strongest and the most fascinating characters ever caricatured on the silver screen. Daniel Day-Lewis is at the top of his game and virtually unstoppable as Daniel Plainview, a portrayal that not only resuscitated him as an actor, but also established him as someone who wouldn't leave a single stone unturned to bring his character to life and perhaps it is this very attribute that has helped him in his endeavor to be the absolute best at what he does. ",2009
10,"PT Anderson delivers perhaps his best work with ""There Will Be Blood"". Unlike ""Magnolia"", the film's daunting runtime is not very daunting whilst watching it. All acting in the film was solid, even the work of the child actors. Daniel Day-Lewis in particular delivered a truly phenomenal performance, capturing the power of greed, fear, insanity, and comedy simultaneously, at many points throughout the film. At no point does the time period distract from the power of the film. Sometimes period pieces cannot be appreciated because they delve too deep into historical details -- turning the experience into more of a documentary than a narrative set in the past. This is not the case for ""There Will Be Blood"", as human interactions are the focus of the film. Johnny Greenwood's chilling score is very strong, benefiting from the elegant minimalism that he show's in the band Radiohead. The cinematography is also spectacular. Robert Elswit beautifully captures the essence of the environment and the tension amongst the characters. All in all, this is truly a perfectly crafted film.",2007
9,"Who is Paul Thomas Anderson? There is something about him that does't belong to this earth. That could be a compliment or not, it's all up to us. That's what make his cinema so damn unique. At the end of the day it's all up to us. But the abrasive way in which he visits universes and throws his views to us is so powerful, so arrogant, so enthralling, so infuriating that the experience leaves you baffled and suspicious. but also enchanted, transformed. Here, Daniel's saga could very well be the saga of a Hollywood maverick. So little time for sentimentality. Daniel Day Lewis seems to understand it all and he adds his unmistakable humanity to another monster, after his butcher in Gangs Of New York. His performance goes beyond anything we've seen recently anywhere. From Upton Sinclair to Paul Thomas Anderson via Daniel Day Lewis an unmissable work of art.",2008
10,"A few months ago I saw the trailer to There Will Be Blood, at first I was a little put off, it looked very strange and a typical drawn out drama. But then a little later, I saw a different trailer that was much better and looked more interesting. So now it had all this hype and is now nominated for 7 Oscars, including best picture, finally it came to theaters in my home town and my mom and I just saw it. Now, I'm just going to get a complaint out, I think this movie was still a little drawn out, it kind of took on a Kubrick type of feel with the first twenty minutes that had no dialog. But that was the only thing that threw me off. While I'm not as in love with this movie as much as everyone else is, There Will be Blood is going to be a sure classic down the line. The direction, the acting, the script, the sets, everything about this film was done beautifully and shows the utter greed and madness that can turn men into monsters.",2008
10,"What is evil? What is hate? How low can an individual go with one's actions and still be considered human....? These, quite possibly, are the biggest questions raised in There Will Be Blood.",2007
4,"With all of the hype surrounding Daniel Day-Lewis' performance (he was, in fact, given a Best Actor nod from the San Diego Film Critics Society, for whatever that is worth) in the P.T. Anderson-directed tale of early American oil speculation, ""There Will Be Blood,"" I can only relate my extreme disappointment.",2008
10,"If Daniel Day-Lewis doesn't win an Oscar for this performance, there is something horribly wrong. His performance and this film were amazing. I don't give this kind of accolade out generously. I was at the screening at the Chelsea West. We waited outside in the cold and rain for a good two hours to get in there and get some good seats and I can honestly say, I would have waited double that amount of time. Enough of my rambling though. In regards to the film itself; it was very well done. The cinematography was amazing as well as the set design. As usual, PTA gives us a flawless script with terrifying, humorous, and compelling dialogue. All of the acting was spot on. Paul Dano played the role of a two-faced, maniacal, and power hungry preacher. The young man who plays H.W. Plainview was also very solid. As PTA stated during the Q&A last night, he seemed to know everything about the story and his character and seemed to be a natural. Daniel Day-Lewis. Need I say more? He was breathtaking in TWBB. Amazing is all i can say. You will need to see the film to see for yourself. Some may become bored with the film at times, which is what i gathered from the people sitting around me. I had no problem with the ""slow"" scenes, but the general public may have a problem grasping this film. If anything, this will be the reason if it gets snubbed at the Oscars.",2007
10,"exhilarating, suspenseful, chilling and beautiful.",2008
3,"I like Upton Sinclair and I like Daniel Day Lewis (DDL) (esp. impressed with Gangs of NY), but this movie is a flop in so many ways I can't recount them all here. Generally. it suffers from a deeply flawed screenplay and what I would presume to be the misdirection of DDLs considerable talent. In roughly 2.5 hours, the movie does almost nothing to either account for or reveal in any particularly interesting way the moral bankruptcy of Plainview. Insofar as DDL's performance is concerned, it is particularly overacted at the scene of his baptism, when his overt contempt for the proceeding could not be more apparent. While we can sympathize with his plight and laugh with his sarcastic murmurings, it is simply unbelievable that such a manipulative person in desperate need of the critical lease for his pipeline wouldn't at least fake the requisite sincerity, especially as we know the Plainview character is a capable performer and has a history of doing so. The 30 minute over-dramatized coda explains nothing and adds nothing and thus the movie's conclusion is abrupt and unsatisfying. We already knew that Plainview was brutish and that Eli Sunday was a fraud. Some better explanation for the distance between D Plainview and H.W. would have been welcome, but none was offered.",2008
3,"First off, I'd like to say that I have enjoyed most all of PTA's films. I loved Boogie Nights, thought Magnolia was an ambitious, but not great picture, and thoroughly enjoyed Punch- Drunk Love. I, like many others have eagerly awaited Paul Thomas Anderson's latest film, There Will Be Blood. In fact, I drove almost 120 miles and waited 2-3 hours in line to see it, as that was the closest showing of it. I bought into all the hype, read almost every review, watched any and all interviews of it that I could, expecting a ""masterpiece"" as so many IMDBers put it. People even had the audacity to say it's one of the best films of the decade. Some big words and shoes for a film to fit. ",2008
1,I viewed No Country for Old Men twice and thought it was one of the best films I've ever seen. It was time to see another film so I read some of the reviews here on IMDb. There will be blood had nothing but great reviews and was getting awards and nominations like No Country for Old Men so I figured I had to see it. It wasn't available to see locally for a couple weeks and I unfortunately didn't check the reviews again before going to see it yesterday. I'm seeing bad reviews for this film now and I can understand after seeing the film.,2008
1,"Hi. How's everybody doing? I just saw 'There Will Be Blood' last night. I don't like the idea of spending my whole life on the internet on message boards discussing trivial aspects of pop culture, but I felt compelled to issue a warning about this film. Critics seem to like it. Oscar nomination folks gave it a nod. Even more so, the pseudo-critic/'we derive personal validation of our innate human desire for creation and creativity by attaching ourselves to the works of others like leeches"" folks really really liked it.",2008
1,"I heard about the reviews for this movie and my husband and I set out for a good movie afternoon. The opening scene is a beautifully shot red rocky landscape with green hills and a stark blue sky, the soundtrack is not a soundtrack but a screeching sound reminiscent of fingernails on a blackboard. I nearly left then and should have. No plot, no female characters, Daniel's son is a wooden puppet who barely speaks and at times I held my hands over my ears to block out the horrible, excruciatingly loud, obnoxious soundtrack. It was so loud, much of the time you could not understand the actors. Now what's the point in that? I wondered why we came, then figured it out. ",2008
3,"Being a huge fan of Paul Thomas Anderson, my expectations were high for this flick, but alas, it did not deliver. Brilliantly directed by Anderson, with a phenomenal central performance by Daniel Day Lewis, I think the problem with the film is at a fundamental and conceptual level. The work is ambitiously themed, but Anderson hasn't taken the timeor perhaps didn't have the desireto draw us into the story or the characters. Magnolia was an epic, ambitious work also, but it was on a human scale, and Anderson never seemed to be reaching for his effects. There Will Be Blood is another matter: it's all reaching, but it comes back empty-handed. Based on Upton Sinclair's novel, the film tells the tale of oil man Daniel Plainview, a man without substance, and apparently without heart or soul, driven by mysterious forces (forces that are never revealed), whose only passion is for oil. Plainview doesn't appear to be all that interested in profit, even, and although he is a ruthless businessman, the impression the film gives is that this is more a point of principle than actual greed. We are never given a clue as to what might be behind such a principle, however, or behind the character's stubborn, almost inhuman drive.",2008
2,"The idea that this film is one of the top 250 of all time (let alone top 25!) is preposterous. This is the first review I've submitted, and I do so because I feel compelled to express my outrage that a movie such as this could garner such a high rating, and may by itself destroy whatever credibility the ""250"" list may have retained.",2008
10,"Just so you know where I'm coming from... I think Magnolia is one of the most overrated films I've ever seen. But this... This is a damn Kubrick-level masterpiece. Flawless. Saw it from a folding chair in a overflowing theater at the Alamo's Fantastic Fest in Austin - there were moments where I'd look back and see every jaw in the room dropped. Its less overtly political than I imagined - more about the psychology and emptiness of the lust for power. See this as soon as it comes out - this is going to cause a ruckus (especially coming out on Christmas, Jesus!), and its much better if you don't know what to expect. Except for blood.",2007
10,"There Will Be Blood is a story about greed, religion and vengeance due to the discovery of one of nature's riches: OIL!",2007
1,"I too went to see this movie because of all of the gushing reviews and nominations. Not only do I want my $11 back, I want the two and a half hours back! As far as a compelling story, there is nothing there, there: We have this amoral evil guy, who continues to demonstrate that he can be evermore amoral and evil. For 2.5 hours. We live in a world of that, why would I want to pay good money and my time to see that?",2008
3,"I was greatly disappointed by the film. While Daniel D. Lewis's acting is rather impressive, the rest of the movie is disappointing and it's not clear what the movie is about.",2008
1,What is this thing doing in the top 250? That fact alone forced me to register and comment on this movie.,2008
4,"I can say that 'usually' I am pretty on par with what the general public think of a movie although I have been known to stray my own way with certain films but I am still blown away in reading all the reviews for this film which would have someone believe that this is one of the best films of the year...an opinion shared overwhelmingly with the Academy who has bestowed numerous Oscar nominations on this film so let me be the first to say that perhaps my opinion is not right this time. However, it is my opinion and I was blown away by how truly outrageously BORING and misrepresented this movie is. I don't consider myself unintelligent by any means. I think I can certainly enjoy a great intellectual, artistic picture, and I DO love a great historical epic but I had seen the previews for this film and they represent it completely different than what the film is. There Will Be Blood should have been titled by its origin of work which was ""Oil"" because that is the only thing this film is about. I get the title...its rags to riches, pulling himself from the very bottom through turbulence and trials and ends with him losing his mind basically but my god it takes him a long time to get there and everything in the middle is as boring as the sand around him.",2008
10,"I can't talk about this show enough. It's just genius. I mean, it's so good it survived 75% of the advertisers pulling off after the pilot because of all the boycotts these sad little organizations were doing. It also survived a lawsuit by Red Hot Chilli Peppers on some crap about the name of their song and the name of the series.",2008
9,"Its hard to explain everything that this show has going for it, and if the pilot is any indication, we are in for a fantastically brilliant series.",2007
10,"This has to be one of the best written shows in years. It has so much going on and generally speaking, this is a recipe for disaster. The name tells you this is going to be about sex, drugs and rock 'n roll, and it is. It is also about love, tenderness, trying to keep kids from growing up too fast, dissatisfaction with life and settling for what you think you want.",2007
9,"Maybe I missed something, but the promos of this series made it look like one long ad for a freewheeling guy living a hedonistic Hollywood lifestyle. That's SO not what Californication is about, and frankly, it's a stupid title. There is definitely a high volume of disreputable behavior, and the show is not for kids, but there is a good story here. Hank Moody (Duchovney) is a Los Angeles-based writer whose long-time girlfriend, with whom he has a child but never bothered to marry, has left him. The whole series is about his desire to win her back, his writers' block at the loss of his muse, and his role as a father all in the context of his emotional instability. Duchovney's girl-getting eyes have the same effect on every female opportunity that comes his way in the story as they do on his millions of female fans. The series calls for a bit of a stretch, asking the audience to believe that his power to attract women never once led to an indiscretion while he was living with his non-wife. I loved the characters and although it is not realistic, it is an interesting venue for the observations made about what destructive behaviors women are willing to put up with. It also gets very far away from the Jerry Seinfeld, man-child type characters that are romantically inept. Hank is a ladies man AND a man's man. He's the lovable bad boy with a heart of gold. For those concerned about content for kids: DO NOT WATCH THIS SERIES. There is constant language, smoking, sex, frank discussions about sex, drug use viewed as acceptable, nudity, and references to all forms of adult themes. But the story line is not as prurient as all of that suggests. Hank is a family man who engages in behaviors because he has no brakes to stop him i.e. his family living with him. He doesn't actually LIKE the behaviors and wants to marry the woman who left him and spend more time with his daughter. Great acting by the entire cast --and a *really* tall cast it is!",2009
10,i really loved the pilot!,2007
9,"Duchovny is perfectly cast here as Hank Moody, and delivers his witty and wry lines with tongue firmly implanted in his cheek. Playing a talented but dysfunctional writer in the middle of a mid-life crisis, Duchovny's character is spot on. He can't pass a whiskey glass or a skirt and they even throw in a Porche for him to drive, in case your mind drifts. Only this is his mid-life crisis so we can laugh at it. It's OK. Natascha McElhone, having survived the Hungarian Revolution on The Company, gets to do something fun this time. This is good. She's both talented and HOT! ",2007
9,"I can't remember when I laughed so steadily from start to finish of a new show. Family Guy? Perhaps. In Californication Showtime has one of its strongest hits . . . ever. The writing is bitingly crisp, intelligent and fresh. Duchovny's delivery has the timing of a master comic actor and his portrayal of Hank is winning. As with the very best of comedies, beneath the bubbly surface of Californication is a show that in a single episode reveals richly drawn characters of depth and purpose. Hank's lecherousness, womanizing, wry wit and in-your-face bluntness succeed only partially in covering up a complex (or perhaps merely complicated?) man who appears to be facing all of his mid life crisis's at once. Every note in this comic symphony was perfectly struck and I look forward to getting to know Hank - and the rest of his gang - better as the weeks go by. Bravo Showtime!",2007
9,"I just watched the pilot on-demand and I have to say I am thoroughly impressed by this show. David Duchovny was a pure gem to watch as the sardonic and hapless writer in the surreal realm of Southern California. The dialogue is top-notch, the plot is thick and juicy. Hank is a deep, 3-dimensional character that we seldom see on television. Though he is definitely damaged, there is something in his tribulations that audiences can relate to. His difficulty in writing is a situation I have felt many times when I sit down at the keyboard. Similarly, I empathize with his relationship problems. The problems he faces are problems that real people face brought to life in a very funny, unique way.",2007
10,"If you have Showtime and you're not watching Californication, you're definitely missing out. I'm so glad I watched the first episode because I was hooked within the first five minutes and haven't missed an episode yet (I think it's up to 8 episodes now). I'm getting Showtime for free right now but just because of Weeds and Californication, I would probably continue paying for it after my free time is up.",2007
10,"I am greatly enjoying this show and hope it will run a very long time. There's something about this show that seems so real. It makes me laugh, it makes me think, and it brings something to the table for everyone. It has emotion, sex, passion, hard times, and complexity. Hanks character is absolutely great, and all the other characters are developing very well, and becoming very unique. I also enjoy Nip/Tuck, but this show is like a much more tangible version, with more depth, and somewhat on Valium (as it is much less over the top!). I believe that anyone can relate to this show with all this depth, diversity, and complexity. I highly recommend this show to anyone, and I am in love. I will definitely not miss an episode and look forward to buying the DVD releases in the future. Bravo to all parties involved with this series!",2007
3,"A show that guest stars: Marilyn Manson, Tim Minchin, Heather Graham, Rob Lowe and has David Duchovny (X-Files) playing the lead role sounds like an amazing show, right? ",2014
8,"I have watched 3 seasons of this show now, and I have to admit it is one of the most well written shows. Along with the nudity and the explicit nature of the show, it most importantly has a beautiful storyline. Its not just one of those shows with sex, drugs and booze. Its also about love, father-daughter relationship, loneliness, infidelity and regret.",2011
1,"Well, I have probably not understood ""the magic"" of this series. I do not see the theme as ""controversial"". Sex? Marijuana? ""Controversial"" these days? The Sons of Anarchy are controversial, because they depict ""collaboration"" of police to gang members, cover-up of murders etc. ",2011

1,"I watched the entire first season, waiting for something to happen. It didn't. The characters are dull and I can't imagine anyone having any sympathy for them. Especially the main character. He's just an asshole, but it seems the show is trying *really hard* to get you to like him. Oh, he's so clever when he messes with his ex's life and acts like a spoiled child who can't be bothered to work in life.",2014
10,"It's one of the five greatest shows I've ever seen. The writing is absolutely perfect and does a great job with both the comedic and dramatic scenes. David Duchovny's Hank Moody is one of the finest characters ever put to the silver screen and his performance is really what makes the show just so damn enjoyable to watch. The sex scenes were hilarious, and the entire story with Charlie (Moody's agent played by Evan Handler) and his secretary (Bully's Rachel Miner) started off very hot as they indulge in a Secretary-esquire relationship and then got hilarious once they started having a threesome with Charlie's wife Marcy (the hilarious Pamela Adlon) and his nipple gets ripped off and then Marcy actually sleeping with the secretary on her own.",2008
1,"I loved the first three seasons of this show, when it was still fun, well written and even innocent (in a very non-innocent way). Then seasons 4 & 5 came and went, leaving little impression other than ""more of the same"". Season 6, though, has driven right off the PCH into the ocean. It's cartoonish, lacking any depth or nuance, almost as if the Wayans brothers had decided to make a broad, boorish spoof. In keeping with season 6's sophomoric obsession with all things sexual, at best it's a teenage masturbatory fantasy; at worst, it's an abortion. Sad to see the terminal decline of what began as a truly great piece of television.",2013
1,Why does everyone say this show is so great? Just because there's sex in it? The opening scene of the pilot episode is Duchovony getting a blow-job in a church from a nun. That doesn't bother anybody?,2009
1,"I really do not understand the appeal of this show. Do people just enjoy watching him get a lot of hot girls? To me, the show is pointless and almost everything that happens is nonsense. The characters are just straight up annoying and the plot is non-existent. Maybe this thing gets better as the show goes on? But I can't seem to make it past the first few episodes of season 1. All the situations are forced, unlikely and poorly developed. I am really surprised at how highly rated this show is on IMDb.",2014
3,"I watch this show every now and then, since the premise was an interesting one: the midlife-crisis of a modern bad boy in LA, the city where getting older isn't an option. The potentially good material is wasted in such a distasteful manner it's sickening. Untopped is the hypocritical morality the show tries to sell to the audience.",2011
4,"""Californication"" was, for awhile, a good show. On the (rather large) surface, it was about sex, drugs and rock'n roll, about Hollywood lifestyle of the most degenerate kind. But on the inside, it was a love story about broken people. ",2016
3,"Okay folks ,so after watching a few terrible and boring episodes I've finally decided to write an honest review as possible. First of all ,it's way too overrated and way too hyped --in fact ,I can't really believe that this total stupidity went into our television's prime time not mentioning the big awards and trend around it...it's just crap ,possibly another one of the worst commercial TV shows ever. Second ,the whole story gets into a pointless kind of comedy drama dumb cheesy plot without any interesting developments nor interesting characters -total bore and commercial trick. In conclusion :if you have a brain just use it -avoid this predictable and uninspired stupidity at all costs.",2012
1,"I want to know where you people come from - what walks of life, what experiences have you had that made you think this show was good? I only know two people who watch this show. A 40 year old divorced doctor and a 21 year old German guy who probably has limited access to American TV. I understand divorce is an interesting subject to see on TV, but it doesn't make the writing good. How many stories of self-pitying rich old men from NY and CA do we have to witness in order to feel good about our own lazy tendencies? Yes, most people who have time to sit in front of the TV, watching crap like this, would fall into the category of lazy nihilist, so it makes sense that this show lasted so long. Good job supporting a TV show that encourages your lack of motivation to be interesting, and replaces it with self-satisfaction and the trials and tribulations of being wealthy and boring.",2016
2,"By now, most of the Tudors' historical inaccuracies have been well pointed out; indeed, it's safe to say that the only thing that wasn't changed was the names. Granted, the series isn't good history. But is it good television? Unfortunately, although the Tudors are doubtlessly a visual triumph, they are also a fiasco in terms of pace, dramatic development and characterization  that is, the things that matter.",2008
9,"The Tudors is a fantastic show which showcases the life and times of King Henry the VIII. As the opening of the show tells the viewer, ""You think you know a story but you only know how it ends. To get to the heart of a story you have to go back to the beginning."" I'm sure a lot of people watching the show are watching it for entertainment and not because of its historical accuracy. I personally love Tudor England and know a lot about it. The show takes many liberties, but that's why it's entertainment and not a biographic film on the King. It's fascinating to see what is kept of what many believe to be true and what is changed. Things such as basing Henry's sister Margaret after both his sister Mary and his older sister Margaret is very interesting turn. The first four episodes have been phenomenal works of cinematic art which I hope will continue on for seasons to come.",2007
6,"I'm glad to see Showtime taking on the Tudor era, even if they are doing it because Henry's life is a tabloid-seller's dream come true, and our culture is tabloid-obsessed.",2007
7,"Well, it's gorgeous, well-acted but far too much tampering with the facts of history. Henry had TWO sisters, not one, and it was his sister, Mary, who was married off to a king in his dotage - and it was to the king of France, not Portugal. Margaret was married to the Scottish King, from whence comes the Stuart claim to the English throne. Don't watch this for your history exam! Just enjoy the costumes, set, fiery acting and music. The portrait of Henry, though, is wonderful. Lest we forget; he was quite handsome and charismatic in his younger days. As he continued getting his way both in politics and the bedroom, he grew more and more self-absorbed and ruthless. One good historical item is pointing out that, whatever was going on in separating from the Roman church, most of the English reformers had little use for Luther and wished to distance themselves from the continental reformation. Odd that today the Anglican Communion and the Lutheran church work hand-in-hand in aid efforts and acknowledge more readily our common bonds. Just FYI, the word ""protestant"" actually means one who protests the abuse of the Sacrements, which was rampant in those days.",2007
1,"What a waste of a great cast and lots of money! I love historical costume dramas but I was truly appalled at the soap opera-level of this script. There were such great historical events taking place at that time, such as mad King Henry's lust for an heir and willingness to plunge his country into a religious war, betrayal of his wife, intrigues of his court, black plague, etc. Yet we are subject to sex, sex, and more sex every third scene. I did find the Henry vs. the Cardinal plot line interesting, and Henry vs. his wife. But these subjects are dealt with in a very heavy-handed manner, with such obvious dialogue and no subtlety. Part of the reason I love English drama is the usually intelligent dialogue. I felt like I was watching a soap opera like ""All My Tudors."" You know you are watching trash when the characters keep jumping in bed to keep you interested.",2008
2,"Showtime's obviously expensive production of ""The Tudors"" has got its first season into circulation as a set of DVDs. I have seen some advertising on this, and my first reaction was that any series portraying Henry VIII as a lean man with black hair can't be all good. The truth turns out to be worse. It would take a few days of solid research to plumb the depths of this historically ludicrous series.",2008
2,"Just like the title says, Michael Hirst should be banned from doing historical movies. His work has a complete disregard for history (just see Elizabeth to figure that out). I understand the need for drama but Tudor History was full of drama without completely destroying the actual facts.",2007
10,"The series so far has been interesting, but it never ceases to amaze me that these historical pieces often abandon with no apparent reason the historical facts. Case in point is the role played by Gabrielle Anwar, called Princess Margaret int eh series. There of course was a Princess Margaret, but she married James IV of Scotland, was the mother of James V. Her marriage to the King of Scotland eventually led to the ""Union of the Crowns"" of Scotland and England. Henry VIII had another sister, Mary. This one resembles the character a bit more, but Princess Mary, married Louis XII of France and was therefore Queen Consort of France. After the death of Louis XII she remarried Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, as in the series. I'm not saying that everything else about the series is accurate, but why change this character when the real history is as interesting or more than the storyline used? Mary's short marriage to Louis of course preceded the reign of Francis I in France. Maybe they wanted to make the rivalry between Henry and Francis such a big part of the story that they decided it was worth changing the historical facts.",2007
9,"The Tudors is about as close to perfection as a show of its genre can get. I understand people may argue that there are many historical inaccuracies but these become irrelevant when you realise the quality of the sets, scripts and not to forget the incredible acting.",2009
1,Worst Henry VIII as he looks nothing like him,2009
2,"Considering that nearly everyone has seen some version of the reign of King Henry the eighth, this shows unbelievably sloppy writing, woeful miscasting in key roles, and reduces the central character to a narcissistic sociopath, and not the deeply flawed but charismatic ruler, scholar and musician he was. It also blithely ignores the speed with which the King degenerated from being the athletic, idealistic, hero of his people to the bloated, diseased, morally bankrupt tyrant he became, as the consequence of his desperate desire for an heir.",2009
8,"Having finished the first season and rewatched it a half dozen times as I wait impatiently for Showtime to unveil the second season of ""The Tudors,"" I have to admit that this show has intrigued me in the history surrounding Henry VIII and his unfortunate wives better than any before it. The producers say it's ""80% accurate,"" and that's an apt description, but what impressed me so much was that within that 80% are some little-known and often overlooked moments that make for great drama. Like the fact that the little wrestling match between Henry of England and Charles of France actually did take place, or that the only time Queen Katharine lost her cool in all that she was forced to endure was over the succession, and subsequent threat to her daughter's rights to the throne. Even certain of the dialogue is ripped right from the pages of history.",2007
4,"I appreciate that the series tries to give us a look at a Henry other than the fat old Henry of the Holbein portraits. But when Henry looks like he's in his 20s and Katherine of Aragon looks old enough to be his mom, this makes me annoyed.",2007
10,"I absolutely loved this show! It got me completely fascinated with that time period. Obviously there are people who say that it embellishes too much but its Television and it is meant to entertain, and it does that perfectly! and truth be told, it really doesn't take too many liberties. I've seen shows and movies do way worse. I found myself constantly having numerous web pages open checking up on facts and what happened and I was often surprised at the things they included. Absolutely stunning show and I believe it does a great service to the time period. Don't be discouraged by the very few bad reviews. It's a must watch!",2011
10,"I had finally come to review this show as I had been a fan since its creation. Before reviewing however, I had to read other user reviews, and I must say WOW. Really? Just really...? So many complaints because they tampered with a few historical facts. Henry had two sisters, clothing was not correct, bla bla bla. Get a life, or take a history course. Showtime is not obliged to bring us a perfect history lesson, nor should you cry about like some whiny child. It is really just stupid that you would give this show 1-3 stars because your having a hissy fit about history lessons, or to much nudity... Regarding that we were presented several beautiful ladies in a sensual way which I commend the director for his ability to deliver this. The show had amazing music, amazing characters, and while season three was the not the best. I would sit and watch it any day over some stupid reality show like The Biggest Loser. So if you want more trash like reality shows go ahead and keep dissing this amazing show. Maybe television will give you the trash you please, but for my sake I hope not. I really enjoyed this series. Just amazing considering most episodes could keep me at the edge of my seat regarding how long each one was. Ignore the crybabies and give this show a chance. If your like me and don't cry every time you don't see Henry's second sister, or the fact he is wearing the wrong shirt, or a breast is shown then you should really enjoy this show. Then again, I am appalled at the hate this show has received....",2011
7,"With the proposed ending of Rome - I think a lot of viewers will automatically turn to The Tudors as a replacement. I have watched the first episode and find that the acting and set alone can pull a viewer in. It is different than Rome, but the same core passions of humanity are present.",2007
10,"I think ""The Tudors"" is the best television I've watched in a long time. Interesting that it was a collaboration between Irish and Canadian TV, maybe that's why the BBC didn't give it more of a profile? I disagree with the approach taken by the other reviewers - it is a DRAMA and never purported to be an accurate historical documentary, so my advice is to understand that first and enjoy it as it was meant to be enjoyed. The acting is superlative from everyone with the exception perhaps of Joely Richardson whom I've never ""got"" anyway - too colourless and divorced from the part. Tamsin Merchant as Catherine Howard gave a consistently outstanding performance, and all credit to such a young actress. Jonathan Rhys Meyers as Henry VIII was absolutely excellent throughout, he thoroughly owned the character and delivered with incredible passion and conviction. (And yes, he was extremely pleasing to the eye unlike H8 - so what?). I would also like to praise the production itself, the incredible and spellbinding direction, the lavish sets and opulent costumes and not least of all the music which I am now intent on buying.",2011
9,"I would recommend ""The Tudors"" to everyone who likes stories about medieval times and about politics in personal and international affairs. ",2011

2,"Watching The Tudors now for the first time, I know it's late but I see that some posts are still alive :-) and I felt the need to write about it. I can watch the 4 seasons straight so it's better. I'd like to say that Jeremy Northam as Thomas More, was real good to see him work and the series lost so much with him gone; despite the work of very good and consecrated actors, good actors and aspiring actors he is one that really set the bar high. Natalie Dormer I'm sorry but hope she would learn how to act; she may be a good person, that's beside the point. As an actress go back to basics: moves, gaze, drop the facial expressions pleeeease, line of character!! It is really painful to watch, it's her fault as much as the casting director and all those responsible for casting her. But above all the bad acting!? - Jonathan Rhys Meyers - how can it be possible to be such a miscast, his looks can go so far as the first episodes after that he has to produce a strong character with the dimension and complexity of Henry the VIII at least, and basically be able to come across as a monarch not as a street ganger, with totally wrong facial expressions, moves, poses, lac of royal pose, after all he's a King and was born and educated to be one, it's not you grocery delivery boy down the street that was just promoted to be King. To immature for this role. Despite all the reason: historical mistakes, plain and simple insults to other cultures - the episode with Portugal and the appalling Spanish accent of the actors that are supposed to be Spanish - the wardrobe and jewellery, so called poetic licences, I consider it to be very dishonest intellectually and a better job could have been done. It takes the same amount of time to do something much better than these with all the means that we see were available. I consider it not to be just by history and to be misleading with the false historical creations. Make money but be honest, hahaha that's a thought!!! I heard that was produced specially for the American market, wow! that's a pretty big statement: so, it's for the Americans it's OK, they don't care about history and as long as it has pretty people in it, lots of sex scenes, and looks old and historical, everything goes.... so sad !!! Do it! with all this ingredients if you must, but do it RIGHT!! There, I let it out of my system... had to! I'm up to season 3 let's see what surprises are there... hope not to have the urge to write again :-) lol",2013
3,"Rather than disliking this show I'd just say I was kind of disappointed. Being a bit of a fan of the Tudor history I was kind of hoping for an in-depth look at a very complex time in British history, sort of like Ye Olde West Wing. The Tudors could have been a show that dramatically explored what was one of the most intelligent, erudite and politically savvy royal lines this country has ever seen. Instead I felt like I was watching a slightly more sexed up Ye Olde Hollyoakes. As a diversion there's absolutely nothing wrong with that I guess, but we just had Rome, which did it a lot better in my opinion. There's no one thing I dislike about this show, I'm just a little down that it wasn't as ""clever"" as I thought it could be. Maybe I'm in a minority though. Hollyoakes still runs despite my best efforts so.....",2007
1,"Problem is some people will think ""this"" show is the real history and take it for truth without bothering to look up the real truth....that's very sad and a disservice to the people.",2007
1,I started to watch this series and i was shocked by the way they showed the Portuguese people. They portrait us (Portuguese) like a retarded nation with dirty feet's (the king) with animal like behavior. ,2007
8,"When young Dewey Cox accidentally cuts his brother in half with a machete, it sets him on a long, hard, and winding road that traverses the most profoundly important moments in modern music history spanning the 1950's to today. ""Walk Hard"" was erroneously advertised as yet another comedic romp from Judd Apatow. While as the co-screenwriter here many of Apatow's trademarks can be found including the usual sophomoric sexual humor and ironic pop-culture references, ""The Dewey Cox Story"" is actually closer in spirit to the mocumentaries of Christopher Guest (""This is Spinal Tap!"" and ""Best in Show"") as channeled through the spastic colon of the ""Naked Gun"" films.",2007
7,"Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story (rated R). Directed by Jake Kasden. Written by Judd Apatow and Jake Kasden. Starring John C. Reilly, Jenna Fischer, Raymond J. Berry, Kristen Wiig, Tim Meadows, Harold Ramis & Chris Parnell. Running Time: 96 minutes. Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com. ",2008
8,"""Walk Hard"" is a clever parody of the life of a rock-star, and bio-pics such as ""Walk the line"", ""Ray"" and ""La Bamba"". It follows the formula nearly perfectly, and follows fake rock-star legend Dewey Cox (and yes, they do have plenty of puns with his name, but this is to be expected) through his life in the 50's, 60's, 70's and into today.",2007
10,"I've watched this movie around 50 times. Literally one of the funniest movies ever made. It would be great if it was a movie that kids could enjoy as well, but that is my only complaint. 100% adult themes and shows way too much for a responsible parent to allow children to watch.",2009
9,"And if there is a musical genre out there short of orchestral symphony, it gets sent up by this wonderful comedy.",2009
9,I must admit that I went into this one already thinking it would be another home run by Apatow and the gang. And they did not disappoint. John C. Reily has turned in his most comedic performance to date which is something considering his roles in Talledega Nights and Boogie Nights.,2007
9,"As a huge fan of the previous Apatow movies, I drove recklessly through traffic to make it into an early screening of Walk Hard, and I'm happy I did. I think this movie is a different direction for Judd and his band, as it is more similar to Airplane in style than it is to Knocked Up. But that impressed me that they took that risk and made it work -- and it definitely worked as me and the rest of the theatre were laughing with regularity.",2007
9,"I thought this was a brilliant satire of the biopic genre. It was obviously borrowed from Walk the Line, but there was plenty of other stuff thrown in as well. It was a truly hilarious movie, including the scenes where the band members convince him to try the drugs, a scene with the Beatles, the variety show stuff and interviews, all the scenes with the title character smashing the sinks, and the Walk the Line spoofs. It was very well written with lots of great dialog. You will love all the cameos and other stuff. I guarantee it. This was a tailor-made role for John C. Reilly, who is perfect in and for the part, as is just about everyone in it.",2008
9,"There is no doubt that Walk Hard is a great parody of the musician biopic as we know it today. The film is filled with rips and references to movies such as Walk the Line and Ray. Walk Hard does all of this very well, but also has its own brand of humor and jokes that stand on their own. From the time that the opening scene rolled, I knew that I was in for a treat.",2007
7,"When I first saw the trailer to Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story, I didn't think much of it other than ""Oh, great, another Knocked Up wanna be"", it just seems like they won't stop with these over the top comedies. But my friend and I decided to see it the other night and I have to admit, I really did laugh. I'm almost scared to say that the creators of the Superbad, Knocked Up, 40 Year Old Virgin are doing a great job in the comedy genre. Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story is stupid humor, but it's definitely a need in our lives when it comes to films where we don't have to think but just enjoy. Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story takes a joke at the big Oscar winning biographies like Walk the Line and Ray. Some of the humor is a little out there, but works like in the days of Airplane! The story is a lot of fun to watch though.",2008
7,"Oh yes this movie was funny. I didn't have many expectations, if any, of this movie, but it certainly delivered. I knew from the trailers and ads that the movie was going to parallel if not parody ""Walk the Line"", but there were also several references to ""Ray"". I would say one of the funniest references to ""Ray"" was Dewey Cox losing his sense of smell.",2008
10,"There are only two ways about it - either you think the below dialog is hilarious, or stupid:",2010
7,"I got a lot of laughs out of this film but I warn those that his another modern-day crude comedy. It's definitely not ""family viewing."" It's a parody on ""Walk The Line,"" the biography of Johnny Cash with John C. Reilly playing the famous singer. He is extremely funny in this role but the humor is the absurd, dark variety.....so be ready for that! ",2009
4,"Being a huge fan of the comedies from 80's I can't help but compare the current gang of Apatow, Phillips, Rogen, Ferrell, Reilly, Black etc to Reitman, Ramis, Landis, Murray, Chase, Candy, Aykroyd, Belushi, Martin etc. Funny enough, always appearing Harold Ramis seems to be the only connection between these two generations. ",2010
8,Musicians: this one's for us.,2009
1,"I gave Walk Hard a chance, I really did. I love Judd Apatow's work, as producer, writer or director. Knocked Up is one of my favorite comedies and Superbad is up there on the list. Orange County, directed by the director of Cox, was a decent film but wasn't great. But still, it had it's moments and was watchable. Normally, I can base a movies value on the names associated with it and their previous work , in fact that's the main reason I saw this movie. But sadly, it doesn't live up to anything they have been associated with prior (maybe Kicking and Screaming). ",2007
6,"Considering how bad, the parody genre has gotten as of late. I was blown away by how good this movie was. It's so good, that somewhat belongs in the same levels of filmmakers: David Zucker, Monty Python and Mel Brooks's finest works. Directed by Jake Kasdan, and written and produced by Judd Apatow. 'Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story' tells the story of the hard-knock life of musician Dewey Cox (John C. Reilly) from his rags-to-riches beginnings, his raise as a megastar country star, his struggle with drug abuse, and his redemption in his later life with his later-wife, Darlene Madison (Jenna Fischer). If this story sounds very familiar. The plot echoes the storyline of 2005's Johnny Cash biopic, 'Walk the Line' and 2004's Ray Charles biopic 'Ray'. While, Walk Hard mostly heavily references, those two films, there were also a various amounts of other biopics that the film used as inspiration, such as 2004's 'Beyond the Sea', about singer, Bobby Darin and 2007's 'I'm not There' about musician, Bob Dylan to name some. The film also includes elements of the lives and careers of Roy Orbison, Glen Campbell, Jerry Lee Lewis, Donovan, James Brown, Jim Morrison, Conway Twitty, Neil Diamond, and Brian Wilson. The film portrays fictional versions of artists Buddy Holly (Frankie Muntz), The Big Bopper (John Ennis), Elvis Presley (Jack White) and the Beatles: Paul McCarthy (Jack Black), George Harrison (Justin Long), John Lennon (Paul Rudd), and Ringo Starr (Jason Schwartzman). Additionally, some real-life artists were filmed, playing themselves, including Eddie Vedder, Jewel Kicher, Lyle Lovett and Ghostface Killah. In addition, the film feature several musical styles such as the late 1950's R&B movement, the early 1960's California Sound, the late 1960s Vietnam War Protest Folk-music style, the early 1970s, Space Oddity and last 1970s punk rock movement. Despite the humorous approach to the music genre, the film was so well crafted, that the parody music feature for the films became big hits on their own right. Songs like 'Walk Hard', 'Take my Hand', 'Guilty as charged', ""Let's Duet' & others was nominated for both a Grammy and Golden Globe Award. Songwriter, Michael Andrews and Jon Reilly recorded 40 original songs, which 33 are featured in the movie. All with different music styles. That's pretty impressed. Not only that, but John Reilly sang most of the song. Who knew that John Reilly, not only was a gifted comedian, but also an amazing singer!? I didn't see it, coming. However, Singer Angela Correa did had to provide the voice of Darlene Madison Cox as Jenna couldn't pull it off. Despite that, she did pretty well for the role, that she was given. Honestly, most of the actors in this film, were funny in their own right. As a biopic parody, the movie is very funny. It hit every funny bone for me. Very few misses. If the movie had any faults; I can say, the later unrated version is very disappointing. Adding more juvenile gratuitous nudity and gross sight toilet humor doesn't really make your movie, any better. It's not fan service that most people want to see. Even women and gay people might think it's too much. Also, some of the jokes were a bit tasteless like the whole kid getting killed by a machete fight. Making fun of Johnny Cash's real-life boyhood tragedy is a bit much. It's somewhat offensive. It's shock value that really fails to gain any point of reaction than annoyed. It really doesn't add much to the film that the semi-smart dialogue double sexual entendres hasn't done better. If anything, it just makes the film plot go slower. It's no wonder, Sony felt like to cut over twenty four minutes out of the original film, when it was released. It really did make the film, seem way too long. In my opinion, just go see, the original version over this. Other negative elements of this film is how the movie doesn't really bring anything new to the table. The movie relates way too much on being clichés to be, really that funny. It felt a bit tiresome at parts, because it's predictable. It's so unlike the other comedy music films like 2003's 'A Mighty Wind' or 1984's 'This is Spiral Tap' that relies on some music movie clichés, but also brings something new to the genre to work with. Those films were a little more sophistical with its humor. You really don't know, what's going to happen in those films. Overall: Because of that, I felt like 'Walk Hard' could had been something, really great, but in the end, falls somewhere near above average. Still, I can highly recommended, seeing this film.",2016
7,"""Walk Hard"" is another film from the Judd Apatow gang who brought you such inane gems as ""Anchorman"", ""Talladega Nights"", ""40-Year-Old Virgin"" and so on. In the same vein, you'll get a wacky blend of absurd humor, parody, satire and sexual gags not suitable for young kids. Note: I saw the unrated version which has a few gags featuring, among other things, one or two closeup shots of a man's hangy down thing (haha IMDb won't let me type w.a.n.k.e.r).",2014
7,"For a long time John C. Reilly has been fairly known for playing side characters and supporting roles in movies such as Boogie Nights. Gangs of New York, and an Oscar nominated performance in Chicago. Then he becomes known for doing comedies such as Talladega Nights. Now John C. Reilly had a chance to have a starring role in Walk Hard. He takes advantage of this role as he shows the funny side of doing an imitation of music biopics such as Walk the Line, Ray, and I'm Not There.",2010
7,"I just got back from round two with this film. ""Walk Hard' the second go around made me laugh, but alas I don't think it is a comedy classic. It is however very funny especially if you know your rock music history and have seen a fair amount of music biopics. ",2008
1,"This movie was absolutely awful. The movie falls into inanity almost immediately, and just went downhill from there. This movie is crude, and lacks any plot. The acting is flat enough to make daytime TV look as high quality as stage acting. The movie relies on tired, dumb clichés and stupid dialogue to attempt to mock biopic movies. The effort fails, and absolutely miserably. This movie is totally unredeemable, and lacks social value. The site gags are not even able to make the movie amusing. This movie truly does rank among the five worst movies I have ever seen. I recommend either not watching, or if you must, finding some place to run and hide. Do not watch this movie if you value your brain cells. It is not humorous, and it is not satiric. It is not even slapstick.",2009
8,"I had the pleasure of making it out to the movie theatre this Christmas to go and see a movie. I was shocked too hear my Aunt suggest Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story, but there it was. I went to see it with my entire family and some extended family.",2007
7,"I never heard of this film before watching it on cable. It turned out to be surprisingly funny. This movie is about a fictional musician named Dewey Cox. It sort of follows recent films like the ones about Ray Charles and Johnny Cash. It starts with Dewey as a boy and he is responsible for a horrible accident with his talented brother. It's quite funny as the top half keeps talking. Flash forward to high school. Dewey is now played by John C Reily and he is supposed to be 14. Quite funny. He sings a song that sends people into a tizzy. Next thing you know his married, with a kid, and trying to make it in showbiz. Another really funny thing is whenever Dewey runs into the Tim Meadows character doing drugs. He also says you don't want none of this. Then acts offended if Dewey wants to say no. But as the story goes, Dewey gets hooked on drugs. He gets anther wife and has so many kids he can't keep track of them. He is at odds with his dad.",2008
7,"Every comedy has its moments, and this Walk Hard doesn't have anything spectacular to make it stand out from all the other passable, but ultimately forgettable, comedies. John C. Reilly plays Dewey Cox, who is basically Johnny Cash... this is, after all, a spoof of a biopic.",2007
9,"Five minutes into the screening, I commented to my friend how well written this movie is. Holy cow, they nail every rock bio-pic cliché and then some. Hilarious from the first moment to the closing credits. Our crowd applauded at the end. Of course, it helps to have the director introduce the movie and for the sound crew to be local (somewhat) celebrities. And it also helps that we were given passes to see John C. perform a set in character at a local club after the show. Still, none of that would have mattered with crappy writing or performances. The movie stands on its own, should do well at the box office, and in my opinion, is an instant classic. Now, be prepared to experience heavy overuse of a particular joke based on the character's last name. And there's plenty of language to wade through. One more thing, before this hits Comedy Central's line-up in a few years, they'll have to edit one particular scene pretty heavy on nudity - the nudity is really out there, but it's not at all sexy, just played for comedy. You'll laugh, but it's not for the prudish for sure. Okay, I highly recommend it to those over 17 with those caveats. Scotto says Check It Out!",2007

10,"I started to watch this series last month on Netflix (2015), and was so hooked I couldn't wait for the next episode. I also agree with all the positive comments. Being born and raised in Manhattan, I loved that it took place in my city. Even though I was not raised in affluence, The series made me imagine that I did. The acting was so superbly done by everyone, especially Ed Westwick and Leighton Bleester. Their chemistry was so intense and real, it seemed amazing they didn't get together in real life. I'm so sorry that it's over, but happy that I can play it over again whenever I want. I think that we will be seeing a lot more of Ed Westwick in the future; he is an amazing talent.",2015

10,"I watched this show first time few months ago when airing started in Croatia. I got hooked. It's a guilty pleasure. You have that sorta glamor and that little over the top drama. It has so many twists and turns, you can try to guess what will happen next, but you never know. In one moment you can hate one character because of something, and in the other moment that one is great, but someone else is now the one you should hate. Season Finale of Season 1 airs tomorrow in Croatia. Me and my best friend, we always watch Gossip Girl while texting each other. It's a great show for all the ones that love the guilty pleasure kind of shows. I think a guilty pleasure show is a show where there is a lots of drama and you get hooked easily, and you can't stop following it.",2010

If you like teenage girls, drama and slightly predictable shows with also a bit of unexpected story lines then this is the show for you..Oh and catty girls! I have no problems at all with this show... It has its humour as well as all the drama which is good.

I have watched all seasons all the way through, twice. the characters are also perfect. you have Blair who is a literal bitch and knows it, shes always plotting against people who have wronged her and she thinks shes perfect, then, there is her best friend serena who she wont admit shes a bit jealous of. Serena is the wild one, who tries to be a changed person but in reality shes still wild as hell. there's chuck and Nate who are best friends (Blair and chuck are perfect.)

They're just a temporary fix until the network can find another show (can't guarantee a better one) that will hopefully keep its loyal viewers watching until they can redeem themselves. I didn't start watching Gossip Girl expecting greatness, i didn't expect anything, so i'm able to just sit down watch it and be entertained, or find something better depending on the plot that night. So far Gossip Girl has been good at just keeping me busy for an hour. Maybe if we realize that it's not going to be just like the books we'll enjoy all the silly drama.",2007

I think that for all the books fans at first it'll be tragic but u just need to stop thinking and comparing it to the book and it can actually be quite a fun way to kill and hour. I do think though that this guy, don't know his name, is trying to make this story look like the OC-NY but that's because i think he must have read the first couple pages of a book and copied the names, he really messed it up, jenny is nothing like she's described in the book, chuck! he's the worst i think, and Dan and jenny's father, makes me sick!

5,"I would have to agree that this show is totally over-hyped mainly because it was based on a best selling series ala the Twilight saga-turned- movie franchise. As best as the writers try to entice audiences with the convoluting plots and supposedly thickening suspenseful drama from week to week, the show has failed to keep the book's original storyline and the characters are not much what the book had depicted them to be. It is because teen-aged girls and fashion savvy women make up the audience which makes the show very popular. Its varying fashion pieces from episode to episode makes it worth watching and also thanks to its beautiful actors that compensate for a show that's almost devoid of quality. In the acting department, most of them rely on the script and their looks, showing not more than bland expressions throughout the season and sometimes looking as though they're reciting than really acting out a range of emotions. I should be a little benign to the actress who plays Blair Waldorf (Leighton Meester) because I felt she was the only one who could brilliantly capture her character best and was able to deliver most of her lines memorably. So I beg the question, should you watch the show? Personally, yes if you are missing entertainment from your life and no, if you already have sufficient drama in yours.",2009

9,"'Gossip Girl' is an amazing TV show, with outstandingly - well - played characters. The whole concept of being made into a curiosity of this website 'Gossip Girl' is fascinating, as well as frightening; which gives it a delightful twist, capturing pleasured viewers. *Spoiler alert of a future relationship if you have not yet watched S01XE07 and further to S02XE25*. Blair's attempts to allure and attract Chuck are both humorous and magnificently manipulative. She's head over heels for this harsh 'play boy', which can be quite deceiving as Chuck's idea of wit is heavily intimidating and cruel; yet, the way that she alters his unpleasant ego is emotionally stunning. We soon find out that he's crushing on Blair, though he acts like it isn't true in order to 'save' his bad - boy reputation, or feel even a small amount of guilt. That's what makes it entertaining and attractive. As for other relationships, which are a major part of this show; the struggle of choice for the 'it - girl' Serena delves deep into your heart as you gloom over the handsome men that she has to choose between,especially the main ones, as though you are choosing between them yourself. Overall, the show is incredibly amazing. There, like most other shows, are some annoyances along the beautiful journey in this show; yet's mostly fantastic and I definitely recommend it to females and males aged in between 11 - 29.",2017
9,"The first season of Gossip Girl, television series produced and written by Stephanie Savage, is extremely well written and starts with a bang of drama and the clashing of the worlds of people in a first class New York private school. Not everyone fits the one image that is acceptable at this school, but everyone wants to. While wanting to be ""one of them"" bewilders the oldest Humphrey, it drives his younger sister, a freshman, to do things she'd never imagine. In the first season, there are many secrets revealed as the return of the once queen bee Serena baffles the elite community. Blake Lively really nails down her role as Serena van der Woodsen. Although her presences in Green Lantern and The Age of Adaline are amazing they don't do her justice compared to her performance as Serena in Gossip Girl. She is able to portray Serena's complicated and unique life spectacularly. Her wealth doesn't touch how down to Earth she is unlike Blair Waldorf played by Leighton Meester. Blaire is Serena's stuck up but incredibly intelligent best friend. She has dreams of Yale which suits her arrogance, intelligence, and wealth. Wealth is a major part of the show, as Gossip Girl is full of the wealthy's secrets. The elite community idolizes Gossip Girl, a blog of all of the juicy secrets of Manhattan's upper east side. The first episode sets the tone for the entire season with unexpected secrets revealed left and right. The first season is packed with relationships, drama, and the lives of ""manhattan's elite"" being exposed. As the season goes on it becomes easier to see the amount of change in each character. Could rich but filthy Chuck Bass end up with innocent Blair Waldorf, or is it Blair and Nate forever? Dan Humphrey dating Serena van der Woodsen is completely out of character for who he starts the season as. As the season goes on it raises the question, is Dan changing, or is his character just finally being revealed? Can poor, little Jenny Humphrey play with the big dogs like Nate Archibald?",2016
10,I have seen this show over and over again. Started watching it for the 8th time today. I also know a lot of friends who have done the same thing. This is just genius! ,2016
8,"I confess this show is one of my clearly-no-longer secret pleasures. The stories of Heartland resonate with me in quite a different way then most of the pablum I watch on television. The travails of a multi-generational country family, the mix of urban experience and back to the horse-manure land operation, the western motif and the youthful tales of love, of coming of age, of environmental concern, well I find some comfort and a strong sense of just about lost values in the telling. Above all else, the story of the young horse whisperer is almost mystical. If it borders on trite from time to time, it is easy to forgive this creative slight. A very pleasant TV experience.",2009
9,"First off, I'm a 32 year old man living in Upstate New York. I drive a truck and have seen a horse up close maybe 3 times. I love this show. The acting is great and the script is written very well. Every now and then, you can predict something, but very rarely can you be specific. Everyone talks about the horses and the heartwarming tales. I agree with all of that. I'm writing this as of the completion of the 8th season. Ty's character was my favorite. I loved Amy as well, but Ty is the kid with the troubled past. I enjoyed how his past became relevant more than once. It's not like he moved and everyone back home forgot about him. He grew as a person and a man. Great things were portrayed in this show.",2015
10,"Heartland is a true family show grounded in the values of times past but in a present context, leaving the viewer with a light and happy feeling at the end of each episode. It is a true delight to watch and the characters are incredibly genuine, making it easy to empathise with their lives and dilemmas. My son is 15 years old and as with other children his age, addicted to modern technology, yet since I discovered Heartland, we enjoy nothing more than sitting down in the evening and watching a few episodes as a family, something that I doubt no other PG-rated show could have achieved. I would recommend Heartland to everyone of all ages who wants to watch a heartwarming television show that brings its stories to life.",2013
10,"Heartland is a heartwarming, and exciting family series. My daughters and I love the show - it has become a real mother - daughters time for us. We love horses and the ""Healing Horses / Healing Hearts"" theme is really inviting and enduring to us. We have a large number of friends and family that share our feelings and interest in the show - which makes watching it even more exciting because my daughters love going to school the next day to talk with all of their friends about what happened on the last episode. We just finished watching the season finale and my daughters begged me to go online to find out if the first season will be coming out on DVD and when the second season will possibly start. We find the show very well acted, and extremely well written - the story line is infuriatingly enticing (we can hardly wait to see what will happen to the characters next). The fact that it is based in the Canadian Rockies is just a bonus and certainly must make filming the beautiful landscapes easier. The camera angles and lighting certainly create the right mood for the moment and really make the characters and setting believable. It is hard to believe that a story based on such a tragedy can bring such feelings of love and happiness to the surface, but this show really pulls it off. There is just the right combination of action, drama, romance and comedy to make it enjoyable for everyone watching. We look forward to the next season (we are saddened that the first season is over already). We surely hope that the first season will be brought out on DVD very soon as it is the type of show that one can watch over and over again.",2008
10,"Love watching the show. My daughter and grand daughter love it too. Grand daughter is 2 and says horsey show mama. She would have it on all the time. Too cute. Wish we had more heart warming shows like this. I like the values it teaches. Family is so very important, and this shows a family's struggles and victories. Sleepless nights I turn on Heartland and have a marathon till morning. Wishing episodes 6-8 were available here. I will just have to wait. The story line and cast are excellent. Awesome family show. Makes me want to get baby girl a pony. Would love to see Calgary someday. It truly is beautiful. Would recommend watching this series, it will fill your heart with joy. Grew up with horses at grandfathers. So the story falls right in with all I remember growing up.",2014
10,"I discovered this series by accident on UP TV. The saga revolves around the multi-generational Fleming family on their Heartland ranch in Alberta. Grandfather Jack is a somewhat crusty individual who is the one everyone else turns to for advice and help in times of trouble. Amy is the central character, one of Jack's two granddaughters, who is, if you will excuse the expression, a horse whisperer. Lou is the other granddaughter, a good-hearted but often too aggressive take-charge person. Chris Potter plays Amy's and Lou's father, an x-rodeo cowboy always looking for a make-money scheme. His wife was killed in an accident, which plays heavily in the first seasons episodes. Ty Borden comes to Heartland on a temporary visit and stays on as his character grows in importance. These cast members, and all the other permanent or temporary cast members are fine actors. The scripts are well written and directed. Once you see a few episodes you will be hooked and look forward to the next and the next.",2015
8,"I like this show, because first it's about horses. But also because i read the book. The actors are well chosen for the characters and are most like the description of the books.",2010
10,"Hollywood has gone so high-tech and their salaries are so exorbitant that they cannot make shows like this. The United States has beautiful scenery just like Canada, in fact here in Tennessee on the Cumberland plateau we have vistas very similar except the mountain peaks are not as sharp. If I ever won the lottery I would love to produce a show like this in Tennessee in a rural area or even maybe Kentucky. The film crews would not have to worry with as much snow so that part would be a little bit easier. ",2013
10,"I just love watching heartland, i normally hate things like this but heartland leaves you feeling warm and fuzzy afterwards. The characters are lovable and the horses are amazing. The story's are gripping and leave you desperate for more. I have watched every single episode as far as series 5. I cant wait for series 6 and hope they go on to make a series 7, 8, 9 and 10. ",2013
9,I read the books when I was little and never knew they had been made into a TV series until this year so I had some major catching up to do! I can't really remember too much of the books just the basic bits which is probably a good thing. ,2014
9,"Love the show..BUT dislike most of the music immensity. It is Also...always ""WAY TOO LOUD!"" I love music and enjoy most types but this whinny, sighing weird stuff really grates on my nerves. I am thankful for the skip intro and review options that allow me to skip the music on Netflix plus..I can skip the ending which always goes out with a tune! Without the music...this show would be a 10 in my book :} I do wish to thank you for the show content and the actors. It is refreshing to have a good family value program to watch.",2017
7,"Living where I am in Buffalo, New York I'm fortunate to get a few Canadian television shows from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation which is on my cable package. If I didn't I wouldn't be seeing Heartland which I'm informed is Canada's longest running television series.",2016
1,"This popular series is obviously something for the Hallmark crowd. So sugary and hokey at the same time with all life crises wrapped up nicely with a bow. Fantasy all the way. I love the horses and watching Amy work her magic. The character of Lou, however is unsympathetic, as played, so it's unrealistic to believe she can actually manage, let alone save the ranch. She never comes across warm.The character of Mallory is grossly annoying and her presence doesn't add to any character dynamic, or plot.She is unnecessary. I suppose it's the lack of depth in the characters overall that displeased me.I had my hopes up, and was disappointed- I tend to like realism and this doesn't have any it's no Longmire.",2016
10,"I have about a dozen shows I watch throughout the television season, and this is by far one of mandatory viewing. The fact that as of season eight Heartland is the longest running one hour scripted drama in Canadian TV history is pretty special. I look forward to the end of the season and see where they leave off, and fervently hope for a ninth season.",2010

1,"My sisters are watching this and my Eyes are falling out... Okay I may be a boy but in my opinion the story is too much ""romance and to horsey""... Now I am 11 and this to me feels like this is for 20 years old. there's one scene that one character swears to god he'll shove a lighting rod down a guys throat!!! Keep It PG people!! And another scene of a guy saying Hell And this rated +10 and Remember 10 year old should not yell ""hell"" around the house...Good job Canada!!!The acting is as bland as cheerios...The story is so perceptible OH ya ooh.. The main character wins the horse competition Blah blah blah and a character gets married ooh.. man and 7 seasons of this %#$!@!!! Yes and ooh man I was forced to watch this show and Oh man someone got some stupid saddle at the end ha ha man so special...And the cast is so boring.. like come on at the end Amy said, ""I love You!!!"" and Ty responded by saying,""me too"" like a robot!!! Stop with It,And they said we will add a new season and NO!!! another 20 episodes of all I just said!!! I had enough of this !@$# stop!!!Good by TV!!!",2017
4,"HEARTLAND is apparently Canada's premier TV drama. And when the show, which is set on a ranch in Alberta, Canada, focuses on the difficulties running a modern horse ranch, it's a lot of fun to watch. Yet all too often we're treated to ridiculous and predictable story lines that are preposterous and make the characters shallow. Let's start out with Amy (the appealing Amber Marshall), the granddaughter of the patriarch, Jack Bartlett (Shaun Johnston). Amy is a young horse-whisperer, who is something of a local legend. But every time she sees her boyfriend, Ty (Graham Wardle), she's an emotional mess. These two miss each other's signals all the time. Her sister, Lou (Michelle Morgan) is even worse. When the series opens, Amy's older sister returns to her grandfather's ranch to attend their mother's funeral. Lou is a mess of insecurities which all-too-often, she disguises by acting superior. She bosses everyone in the family, and when she finally finds the guy she loves, she does the same thing to him. When she gives birth to their daughter, she becomes a total control freak. Lou is smart and very good at business, but suffers from intense guilt as a mother. Her husband is the soul of patience, and I'm amazed at how nasty she can be. Their dad, played by Chris Potter with all the charisma he can manage, is perhaps the most unappealing of the clan. A first class womanizer, this ego-maniac always puts his own needs ahead of his two daughters. When he finds out he's the father of a young boy, he suddenly acquires a conscience. His daughters need to kick his selfish ass out of the house.",2016
10,"This show is completely amazing! The storyline, plot, the characters, the beauty, the memories, etc. there's so much to this show that can teach us about life and the choices we make and the love it shows us. Call me crazy but I'm in love with this show! I love small towns and how they can affect a person and a community I love horses to death and wish I could ride everyday like that. I have never seen a place so beautiful and peaceful I hope this show goes a long ways cause you don't see to many shows that are actually true to heart or they are not just some reality show you see everyday that gets completely old. Heartland deserves an Oscar. I wish we had a place like this in Vegas so I could ride everyday or work at.",2015
2,"Take it for what it is worth. I'm only the second show in and I find every single character annoying, selfish, and each of them, as an actor, are rather predictable and lackluster.",2016
6,"As much as I love the show as the seasons progress , I have found Amy to be absolutely selfish. I now find her so annoying that I forward her scenes. Thankfully enough other characters for me to watch. I also do not like Mallory is treated , especially by Amy. I can't stand Amy anymore.",2017
7,"Heartland can basically be called, ""A show of spoiled, insecure women and the men who are too good for them."" ",2016
10,"I love this show. It has a lot of family situations just like everyone does. Some people complain about Lou, but you can't have cookie cutter people in a family situation. Most families have someone that irritates others in the family. Mallory was irritating on the show just like a lot of teenagers in real life. I got to like her just like the family did. Love Amy and Ty. Was so glad when UP TV decided to bring the show back. I have watched the reruns from the beginning of the series. I get a daily fix on the show. So many bad and violent sex loaded shows on TV. This is a breath of fresh air. Thank you Heartland cast and writers.",2016
5,I love the show especially since I grew up on a small farm as a child. The only bad thing about the show is Lou. Lou from the very beginning just came in & took over took charge after her mother died after Lou had not been a part of HeartLand for many years. She didn't ask her grandfathers permission for or about anything. Lou thinks money is the only way to change anything & everything & make things happier & better & it's not. She all but said so in season 2 episode 11 or 12. In season 2 episode 12 Divorce Horse Lou did does owe Lisa the apology because the brides parents changed everything just like Lisa said they would so the brides parents ruined everything not Lisa! I've seen all the seasons & every episode over the years & Lou is ruining the show. Lou needs to be written off the show somehow whether they kill her off or she moves back to New York or some where else but Lou needs to be written off the show & never return. With it still officially legally being Jacks ranch & he is still very capable of handling it & running it she had no business just pushing her way in & taking over when Jack & Amy & Ty & Mallory could've & can take care of everything just fine. The show is more about Amy & her & her mother gifts & talent with horses anyway. In the real world this wouldn't have happened anyway. Lou has totally disrespected her grandfather & the 5 or so generation before him that founded HeartLand & Lou has disrespected her late mother in the same way. Get rid of Lou. I am totally surprised the show has lasted this long with the character of Lou on it.,2016
10,"Hot Fuzz satirizes American action films in a way that an American satire would not. Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg don't simply spoof the plot threads and the car chases. They know the smaller details of Hollywood's formula, as they exemplify with its continuous references to the scene in Point Break where Keanu Reeves fires his gun into the sky in anger and the scene in Bad Boys II where Martin Lawrence, in a circling tracking shot, says, ""S*** just got real."" Not only do they tackle those less clear characteristics of Hollywood, they also perfectly portray people who talk about awesome scenes in action movies, hilariously by Nick Frost. The film is brilliantly in precise tune with the American mainstream action adventure.",2007
10,"Saw this last night at a special screening followed by a Q&A with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. I liked ""Shaun of the Dead"" but wasn't a huge fan but I liked what I'd heard about ""Hot Fuzz"". I still wasn't prepared to be quite as blown away by it as I was.",2007
10,"I was lucky enough to see a preview of this film for free after I attended a random screening of Scorcese's the Departed. Naturally hearing that the makers of Shaun of the Dead were behind this I had to go see it - if a group of people can make a romantic comedy with zombies, then a buddy cop film HAD to inventive and original.",2006
9,"Hot Fuzz is the story of Sergeant Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg), hardboiled super-cop. Intimidated by his arrest record, his cameo-appearance superior officers (Martin Freeman, Steven Coogan, and Bill Nighy) transfer him from the busy streets of London to the sleepy village of Sandford to keep him out of the way and balance the books, because, to be honest, he's making the rest of them look bad. A big cop in a small town, Angel sees murders and conspiracies where the cameo cast of cops and locals see accidents, but, with the help of his partner Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), it's not long before he discovers that not everything in Sandford is quite what it seems.",2007

8,"So here we have it, the eagerly awaited follow-up from the same team that brought us Shaun of the Dead. But whereas Shaun (hereafter shortened to SOTD) drew its inspiration primarily from zombie films (more specifically, George Romero's ""Dead"" films), Hot Fuzz throws its net a bit wider, taking in every buddy-buddy cop action film made in the last 20 odd years and combining it with a very British perspective. Think Midsummer Murder spliced with Bad Boys 2 and you should have the rough idea.",2007
10,"I will say it out clear and upfront - I love this movie, and without a doubt, a definite contender for my movie of the year. By the filmmakers of Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz has everything that makes great entertainment, laced with wry Brit wit, and while it contains plenty of references from their earlier movie, it never bores, and for cinephiles, you're in for one heck of a time identifying the countless of movie references within. If anything, I can't wait to get my hands on their earlier efforts in order not to shortchange myself in missing out on the gems by director Edgar Wright and collaborating writer Simon Pegg.",2007
10,"""Hot Fuzz"" is brilliant! People who like British humor will love this one! It is really funny! It manages to make fun of ridiculous plots used in action movies and at the same time entertain you with their own ridiculous plot which is quite thrilling! Even when you don't get the subtle humor there are more than enough visual jokes to be enjoyed! I thought it was a stroke of genius to use some serious actors like Edward Woodward,Stuart Wilson and Timothy Dalton! (Timothy Dalton was accused of playing a much too serious James Bond! Well,in ""Hot Fuzz"" he shows that he can be dangerously funny!) As a parody on action movies this movie succeeds where others have failed! I think the credit has to go to the whole team who made this and ""Shaun of the dead"" including the actors! It shows that they actually like the movies they make fun of! That is essential for the the jokes to work! I thought ""Hot Fuzz"" is hilarious and very entertaining! It certainly is one of the funniest movies at the moment! Go check it out!",2007
10,"""Shaun of the Dead"" was probably one of the funniest (if not the best) British black comedy that had been released in 2004. With gritty violence that made you squirm, innocent humour (Nick Frost) with blaspheming insults that just made you laugh out loud, and the quick wit of Simon Pegg with some great fun and horror mixed together, ""Hot Fuzz"" had a huge task of competing with the sheer greatness, of which was ""Shaun of the Dead"".",2007
10,"I was Lucky enough to be invited to a special trade show of Hot Fuzz and there is little to say that could begin to describe it, awesome is a first step.",2007
10,"HOT FUZZ is one the most entertaining film experiences that I've had in YEARS! This is probably the most enjoyable film I've seen since COLLATERAL. And it's a British film, most of which I find heavy-handed and boring! But not this one! It's actually extremely difficult to put this film into just one category: cop film, action, mystery, comedy, drama, parody, homage? It's actually all of these things and much more. As parody/homage, it definitely has elements of a lot of other 'old' action movies in it: LETHAL WEAPON, DIE HARD, BAD BOYS II (they constantly reference this film along with POINT BREAK), and guess what? There's also a big-time homage to A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS at the beginning of the film's spectacular climax! ",2008
9,"Genre parody is running rampant currently, probably because Hollywood is so out of ideas at this point that they've gone down to the level of making fun of their own crap with even more crap that basically every year we get another slew of pop culture regurgitation in the form of Genre Movie and kids films like Shrek, Happily N'Ever After, and Hoodwinked to make sure nothing worth seeing doesn't have its hilarious counterpart. That is why we need people like Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright.",2007
10,"While this movie is a poke at the big budget action flick, it doesn't fall into the naked gun style of spoof. It comes off as if it is being serious, which makes it all the more funny. The first thing that strikes you is the editing. The quick jump cuts used in action films to make them seem edgier, suggesting a frenetic, tension filled pace, are used through out this film, giving any serious action films editing a run for its money. At first, it seemed a little obvious and contrived, maybe, but as the humor started to offset the serious tone being set forth, the movie really started taking shape. In the end, the editing made this film even more brilliant. The acting was terrific. The Shaun of the Dead stars really proved that they were not just one hit wonders. I now think Simon Pegg is one of the more brilliant comedic writers and actors of our time. His stone faced, serious main character sets a tone that made this spoof. I will now be sure to see ANY movie these guys make. This is one of the few movies I'd like to play again after having just watched it. It was just that funny.",2008

8,"Nothing can kill a movie faster than expectation and this is possibly one of the most hyped British films in recent years. Following on from the improbable success of the brilliant ""Shaun Of The Dead"", it seems that every effort has been made to make this film as good as that. But sadly, it falls just short but this is still massively more entertaining than a bunch of other comedies I could mention. It's funny and entertaining in a uniquely British way and proves that sometimes, we can make films that aren't romantic with an American woman pretending to be English. Thank God! ",2007
10,"Hot Fuzz marks the long awaited return of Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright's partnership to the big screen. Shaun of the Dead left them with a very hard act to follow but Hot Fuzz easily achieves expectations and possibly even exceeds its predecessor.

Sadly, after flopping in the US, Grindhouse has been chopped in two, with Quentin Tarantino's segment, Death Proof, being the first to be released on its own after competing at the Cannes Film Festival. It is not presented in its Grindhouse version, which included scratches, dirt, missing reels and other visual aging techniques; instead, we get the full cut, containing additional information regarding certain plot points and a few ""juicy"" bits that were left out first time around (a hot lap dance being the best new scene).

10,"This is an absolutely brilliant film and a film that I could watch over and over. Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino this film seems to have divided audiences like no other, it has been adored and despised in many quarters and there seems to be no middle ground for opinion. It is cited, by Tarantino himself, as being a remembrance to the B movies of the 60s and 70s through the guise of Grindhouse cinema. In order to fully appreciate what Tarantino has done then I would agree that you must be at least familiar (on some level) with the films of that genre and era and familiar with Grindhouse cinema and its workings. It is not an absolute necessity to be fully aware of this type of film-making but it helps if you want to completely appreciate this film. ",2008

This could have been made into a short movie of...er...say...5 minutes. I don't recall such an awful and meaningless dialogue among the characters in a film which lasted...er..some 114 minutes. Nonsense gaily talk for most part of the movie. OK we all love that lap dance but anyway what was the point? Come on Quentin what happened to you man? I reckon that being a multimillionaire does not help very much your creativity.but it will be difficult to made a worse flick. I only felt sorry for Kurt Russel being wasted as he was. You can openly see the potential of his character but feel pity how this mess ended up One last thing, wasn't that car supposed to be deathproof?But not girlsproof? hahaha So do yourself a favour and watch this as a substitute for an sleeping pill when shown eventually late at night on TV.",2007
1,"This is by far and away the worst Tarantino film I have seen. An hour and a half or more (time begins to lose its meaning when watching this rubbish) and 95% of it is spent watching either group of 4 women ""having a laugh"" with each other. Basically this involves unrealistic swearing and dialogue which would have been slightly more believable had it been men saying the lines. There is a short break for a minute or two while the first group of women are killed. After another interminable fly on the wall peek at a further group dribbling on there is an attempt to kill them followed by them deciding to kill Kurt Russels character. This film is reminiscent of a 5 year old's first attempt inexplicably brought to life. Previously I would watch one of Tarantino's films without reading more into it. Now I would have to read some positive reviews. An hour and a half or so I will never get back.",2007

Jackie Brown, Kill Bill, and now Death Proof and Planet Terror, women are invincible, and if they work in the movie business they are unstoppable.

And when the action starts it last 40 seconds and cut. The actors are so lame and the dialog is suppose to be deep and entertaining. IT'S NOT! And why make a character as cool as stuntman Mike, and then make him a complete pussy. This movie is bad avoid at all costs. Q.T. rest in peace.",2007

1,"First and foremost Quentin Tarantino is the most overrated director on the planet! I've seen Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill Vol. 1 and now this and I think I've had my fill of his movies. Why? Because they are all the same. Bunch of people blab about meaningless things mixed with over-the-top violence, mixed with incessant profanity sums up his movies in a nutshell. I wanted to believe that he can change his style around and give you something different but after seeing this its obvious that he cant.",2009
6,"Only a Tarantino film can give you the feeling of pure boredom and electric intensity all at the same time. Both can come of simple conversation and over-the-top action. ""Death Proof"" is the quintessential Tarantino film, where he has long, drawn out conversations that are constantly interrupted yet free flowing and very natural as the characters talk about everyday things (pop culture) and use quirky old sayings. Tarantino is easily the greatest writer you could think of for pure dialogue and even though that's his greatest asset, it's also his biggest flaw. The film is cut into two halves and the first half is excellent. The ending is great (in both halves), but man, did that middle nearly put you to sleep or what?!?! It's not that it was incredibly boring material. The problem was: This was two similar movies smashed into one, with a ton of common parallels, Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell), being the main figure. The second half doubles back on the first half; ultimately repeating itself. The women are powerful. They can control men because men are pigs and only think with their little heads as the women in charge tease them with their sexuality. Even though the girls aren't whores, they surely push the limits because when they don't put out, they'll get a guys respect- a common theme with both the first half and the second coming from eight different women who all think the same. The standout female performance came from Vanessa Ferlito (Arlene) who brought a certain flare to the screen that made the viewer care for her more than anyone else. She nailed this performance and carried the first half along with Russell. ",2008

10,"On first impressions The Mist doesn't remotely seem like the kind of film anyone should be excited about. The Mist, what? A bit like The Fog, then. Stephen King's The Mist, oh, that makes it even worse. Directed by Frank Darabont, since when did he direct horror films? Okay, so he scripted Nightmare on Elm Street 3 and The Blob, not bad films, but not classics in any sense. Starring Thomas Jane, has anyone seen The Punisher. And, to cap it all, The Mist died a quick death at the US box office. It'll probably go straight to DVD in the UK.",2008
9,"I've been a member of IMDb for many years now and rarely do I take the time to comment on a film. In addition, I watch, on average, about 10-15 films a month, split among all genres including horror. Lately though, I've been very disenfranchised with most horror films especially with the proliferation of shock/gore/splatter/torture-porn films such as Hostel 2, The latest Saw film, Captivity, etc. Enter ""The Mist"" and I leave the theater saying to myself ""this is why I go see movies"".",2007
9,"I'll start out by saying that I'm a Stephen King fan and thus I may have some bias. I've watched many Steven King movies but have never given one a rating this high. Most of his horror movies are in the 4-6 range with classics such as The Shawshank Redemption, The Shining, and The Green Mile ranking 8-10 (although two of those aren't technically horror movies). In most modern horror (like the Saw series) there is a greater emphasis on gore than the horror of the human condition and this movie, kudos to the actors, help weave a tale that disgusts you inside and out without the pure reliance on blood spatter (although granted there is a fair amount of that).",2009
8,"If, two years ago, you told me that within a couple of years two excellent Stephen King film adaptations would be released, I would probably have laughed it off. Films like The Shining, Shawshank Redemption, Stand by Me, The Stand and 1408 are usually pretty far between (Note that I consider The Green Mile and Carrie to be the most over-rated King adaptations, so they do not appear here). I like most of the films that have been made from Stephen King novels, novellas, and short stories mainly because I like Stephen King, but I do not recommend many of them as truly good films.",2008
10,"Let me take a breath... Never have I had such a visceral physical reaction to a film... ever. Not even with Elem Klimov's Come and See. In the last fifteen minutes I was nearly physically paralyzed, and then started shaking, realizing how numb my body was... and I am dead serious. Frank Darabont's adaptation of Stephen King's novella goes heads above a 50s/60s monster movie homage. This is grade ""A"" chilling, terrifying, unsettling and utterly hopeless cinema in line with the most cynical and depressing classics from the 70s. The Mist itself and the monsters it brings are just the appetizer here. As all good horror should be, this explores the ultimate enemy, ourselves. In short one of the most beautiful, thrilling and terrible times I've had at the movies.",2007

8,"I was very impressed by this adaptation of Stephen King's 'The Mist'. I have been a fan of the story since it came out and have played the text game and have heard the 3-D audio version of it. This is a masterful suspense/monster movie that puts an ensemble cast into the untenable situation of being in a deteriorating situation they cannot escape from. We watch as alliances are formed, religious paranoia takes hold and, nicely, the movie takes the time to establish characters whom we come to care for before the true action begins. I dock it a couple of points because some of the monsters seemed a little too cgi, and the middle lags a bit, but the much talked about ending is indeed awesome and I was most impressed by the director's decision to keep the music soundtrack down and even eliminate it completely during many of the action sequences. So many movies nowadays crank the music up to 11 to make up for the fact that their suspense scenes do not work. This movie does. I was breathlessly on the edge of my seat for most of it, even though I was already familiar with the story. Highly recommended.",2007

1,"I really expected a lot coming into this movie considering it had a rating on this site of 7.5. The entire time I found myself yelling, ""What are you doing?!"" Almost everything the characters did was ""horror film stereotypical"". As monsters ran towards them, they stood there and screamed instead of running. The crazy lady trying to kill a ten year old child somehow had acquired a huge band of followers within 24 hours who also felt that somehow God would appreciate it it they stabbed the child to death, along with the Army guy. It made absolutely no sense why anyone would listen to her at all. They should have duct taped her mouth shut from the beginning. Overall, I was extremely annoyed by how predictable this movie was and how I felt like I needed to dumb myself down in order to watch it. I couldn't think logically about anything that was happening or else I would have turned it off, so I had to pretend that it was convincing just so I could finish watching it. The ending made me totally nauseas. No one would EVER do what this man did. You battle the monsters for days and risk your life repeatedly and then you think that running out of gas means QUIT?! No, you would not shoot two old people, your own ten year old son, and the woman holding him and spare yourself. That is ridiculous. The personalities that these people had we not the type of personalities that would accept giving up, and the fact that they didn't join the crazy lady's band of insanity shows that the man was not a psycho and would not have shot his child in the head and not himself. I realize it was to spare them from the monsters, but no one in their right mind could do that. Every ""mission"" he went on was life threatening, and all of those people put their lives at risk by getting in that car, so why commit suicide?? They wouldn't. It was stupid.",2008
1,"**This comment has spoilers starting with the second paragraph.** Readers of Stephen King's novellas will remember The Mist as an especially chilling and intriguing thought experiment. How will a random group of people react when confronted with an utterly alien threat, which traps them together in an enclosed place by surprise, one from which there seems no possible escape, and thus makes them confront not only the danger but all the kinds of fears, hopes, and weaknesses human beings have? Other commenters, such as the featured 23 November 2007, have already discussed the good acting, dialog, editing, and tension buildup of what promises to be a solid and actually thoughtful B-movie.",2008
8,"I always say to people that Frank Darabont is the only man who can truly make a great Stephen King adaptation. I'm not so sure I have the credentials to state that as fact, but I do anyways. I love The Shawshank Redemption, but never read Rita Hayworth and I read The Green Mile, but still have yet to watch the film. So, I can't quite compare his work with that of the author, however, that did little to temper my anticipation for his first based on a supernatural story, with The Mist. Early buzz was that he completed the hat trick; even with some unavoidable clichés inherent to the genre, he was able to create something unique and terrifying. I have to say that I agree whole-heartedly. The tale that he has spun and the performances that he has wrenched from his actors are nothing short of spectacular. With the amount of tension built up, you hardly have time to notice the somewhat mediocre effects work and token moments of horror tradition. Whereas someone less capable would have tried to tell the tale of humanity versus the otherworldly beasts outside their grocery store cage, Darabont tells it how it really isfear of the unknown turning man against man. There is no scarier monster than the one hidden inside us all.",2007

10,"I've read through a lot of these comments regarding the Mist and I am baffled as to what people actually want from a movie. The movie bombed in the US and, it seems, most of the negative reviews on here are from US or Canadian viewers. But why? Is it because you have all been spoon fed Hollywood happy ending movies for so long? Is it because you want all your movies explained to you and every detail spoon fed to you?! Do you have no imagination? Its a Monster movie. What are you doing watching this kind of movie if you have no imagination?!",2008
1,It's sad that this movie had potential to be a good movie but is screwed up by having all that bs religious crap mid way through.

When I first heard the plot description, I was expecting the film to be a cross between John Carpenter's The Fog and modern horror disappointment Feast; and while it does have elements of both those movies, it is thankfully much better than both. The film starts with a violent storm that leaves the Drayton family home in tatters. David Drayton sets off to the local store along with his son and a neighbour; but the town is soon plummeted into trouble when it is surrounded by a malicious mist. It soon transpires that there are otherworldly creatures within the mist and the townsfolk in the local store find themselves battling against the creatures as well as themselves...",2008
1,"This movie had no story line to it. I kept waiting for something terribly interesting to happen, but nothing did. In fact I found the story filled with nonsensical dead-end subplots that failed to tell anything. Like the whole stuff about it being the fault of the military. How was it their fault, how did they do what they did and how did they get these results. I was hardly impressed with the cheap theatrics and ""special effects"", in fact instead of horror, I found myself laughing at the ridiculousness of the situation and the acting of some of the performers. I kept waiting for a point, for something to develop, and then thank goodness the movie was over! Sorry Stephen, not one of your best! :-(",2008
2,"First of all let me say, I love Darabont, sometimes love King, and like Thomas Jane. When I first heard of the mist I was extremely excited. Great concept, great talent behind it, should be a great film. However, it fails on almost every level. The only positives that I can say about the film is the absolutely perfect cinematography, and the overall very decent acting. Some of it was over the top, but basically pretty good. Now on to the bad points of the film. First of all, the CGI looked TERRIBLE. I really mean that. It looks pre Jurrasic Park. Every time there is a digital creature, you can instantly tell its digital. Why not use practical effects? ",2007

They nodded weakly in response. On the way home, I kept thinking to myself. ""You liked it! C'mon! It's Spiderman!"" Now, it's two days later, the euphoria of waiting for Spidey to come out has subsided, and I've begun to look at this flick a bit more (shall I say it?) critically.",2007
10,"When you venture out to see a movie in the theatre, you hope to be engaged and have your appetite for entertainment met. You congregate with fellow audience members in the darkness and ideally will leave with a satisfied feeling that only a very good movie can give. The third installment of the Spider-Man franchise did just that for me. The film swung into theatres on May 4th and has broken box office records, making $59.3 million it's opening day alone! SPIDER-MAN 3 is something of a marvel, forcefully shaking off the ""sequel law"" which dictates that each sequel must inevitably get worse and worse, declining in quality and really being just a cheap facsimile of the sharp original movie. The Spiderman trilogy proves once again (i.e. the Indiana Jones trilogy) that the sequel rule can be broken on rare occasion. In case you have not caught the first two Spider-Man films or need some refreshment on the plot, the starting of this film brings you from the beginning of the first Spider-Man right to where the last one left off with a cool montage of clips placed in the opening credits. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) are getting serious in their relationship. But while Spider-Man's popularity in the city is at an all time high, Mary Jane has been let go from her Broadway debut after just one critically bashed performance. Peter is so engrossed in the people's adulation of his alter ego Spider-Man and fails to be a shoulder for MJ to lean on. Peter's former friend, the wealthy Harry Osborn (James Franco), is plotting his revenge for the death of his father who he believes died at the hands of Spider-Man. Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) is an escaped convict who falls into a particle accelerator while on the run, transforming him into a shape shifting sand-man. He wreaks havoc on the city, robbing banks and armored vehicles. At the Daily Bugle where Peter works we have Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), a hotshot freelance photographer who has just been hired. In competing with Peter for the best photos of Spider-Man he cheats by Photoshopping Spidey into a bank break-in. Yet still, there are more problems for Spidey: one night black alien liquid oozes from a crashed meteorite, and attaches itself to Peter while he sleeps. This gooey creature uses him as a host, making him aggressive and causing a downward spiral into arrogance and selfish behavior. As Spider-Man/Peter Parker confronts the darkness in himself, he must overcome the need for revenge which has consumed him after some recent disturbing facts have come to light. I will not give anything away, but those twists affect core plot points as far back as the first Spider-Man movie! Writer/director Sam Raimi weaves it all into a cohesive and entertaining 2 hours and 20 minutes. There could be a lot of conflict in such a loaded storyline, but it is handled deftly by Sam Raimi, and he leaves you at the end wanting more. He makes us feel empathy for the Sandman who is out getting money for his sick daughter, and Harry who lost his father. The first Spider-Man was extremely ""comic-book"", really just a visual thrill ride, while the second one made an effort at having deeper character development in its villains and good guys. The third one leaps astronomically far ahead of the previous two on all levels, making it a strong early contender for the summer's best blockbuster. There is a brief cameo by the co-creator of Spider-man Stan Lee as well, midway through the movie, so watch for that. This movie is the most expensive film ever made in history, costing $258 million dollars! So watch a rare product in today's Hollywood: an enormously budgeted movie that has thrilling special effects paired with a compelling and thought provoking storyline.",2007
10,"I saw this movie at the 12 O'Clock showing and was pinned in my seat from 12:01 to the credits.

9,"This film is deeply flawed in certain ways. It's much more convoluted than its predecessors, and nowhere near as cohesive. It seems like Sam has tried to fit too much into the film. Three villains as well as Peter's own inner demons, tension with MJ, problems at the Bugle...how much can one superhero handle? Sure, everyone has their own part to play...but introducing all those new characters, and having their individual arcs play out to a satisfying extent - it's a big job, and one that doesn't quite pay off - or, at least, pays off at the expense of smooth narrative flow. We end up with some terribly clunky lines of expository dialogue  such as Eddie Brock's line to Chief Stacy, which goes something like 'I'm the new photographer at the Bugle...oh, and I'm dating your daughter' - that will make you spit goo in annoyance (or, whatever it is you do when you're annoyed - I spit goo) The many mental/emotional shifts Harry (poor, poor Harry) goes through are handled in a pretty ham-fisted way, too. I can see what Sam is trying to do...but it just seems a bit...well, the word 'clunky' keeps coming to mind. There are also a couple of very 'sequelly' bits, which seem a little inconsistent with the other films. I'm not talking about the whole 'Flint-Marko-killed-Uncle-Ben' thing  that was actually handled surprisingly well. The most memorable example of what I mean is Bernard's little word in Harry's ear concerning Norman's cause of death. Umm...so, why couldn't he have mentioned it EARLIER?! Like, y'know, at the start of Spidey 2 for instance! It would have saved Harry a LOT of grief - not to mention Pete and MJ.",2007
1,"How anyone can say this was a good movie is beyond me. This quite possibly is the stupidest movie I've seen in a long long long time. And it takes a lot for me to be that negative. You actually have to try to right something so non-sensical and idiotic. I left thinking that this wasn't just the end of the Spiderman franchise but it was done via cinematic suicide. It had to be. Nothing in this movie made any sense. For instance, 1) Sandman - OK so a guy escapes from jail, goes home to see his daughter and isn't caught but then later on he's running through some marshland (in NYC no less) being chased by cops and falls into a giant wide open hole in the ground which is actually a science experiment and the scientist think he's a bird so they don't stop the experiment and the experiment makes no logical sense but turns him into the sandman and the cops that were chasing him run up on this hole as the experiment is going on (again in the middle of the NYC marshland) and are like whoa a big hole wonder if this convict fell in or something, yeah he probably did let's turn around and walk away and let this giant science experiment hole go unaddressed. WHAT!!!!! This really happened in the movie I kid you not. Unbelievable.",2007

Go watch the Amazing Spider-Man series, and enjoy as the so-called ""Peter"" does a flip on his skateboard and write ""I love you"" with his webs on bridge (Ha-ha-ha!). Sam Raimi didn't want to include Venom in this movie, but was forced to. All the fans complain about is that he didn't get enough screen time. Touche to that, truly. BUT, even the little screen time given to him was enough for us to see what he did in a very little time, and we wanted him dead. Now, for the best parts, tell me, didn't you guys like the Sandman part? The bad-ass villain was everything I wanted in this movie, and more. AGAIN, WANT TO SEE A BAD EXAMPLE OF TOO MANY VILLAINS IN ONE MOVIE? WATCH THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2! This movie didn't leave anything half-assed at least. The movie has grossed much more than any of the later Spider-Man movies (or should I even call them that) earned, and the only thing I was disappointed in was that they couldn't get the original series to finish off properly. Long story short, despite what you guys might say, I really loved this movie, and you should really look into the fact that Tobey pulled off the emo part well too.",2014
10,"I saw the midnight showing and was blown away not only by the special effects, but also by the acting and the story. Each movie in this series is better than the last, putting this in the league of trilogies such as Star Wars (the originals) and Back to the Future.",2007
6,"My feelings after watching the third film are somewhere in the neighborhood of satisfied, but that feeling is fairly disappointing. Satisfied more or less means adequate and to follow a sequel that I consider excellent with a film that's only adequate is a certainly a step down. Positively, Spider-Man 3 does reasonably well at maintaining a feeling similar to that of the first two films. I never felt like I wasn't seeing the same world or characters and that's important to me. Continuity in tone really helps hold a series together. The Matrix Reloaded never felt to me like I was witnessing the continuation of the story and world presented in the first installment. The scenery and characters felt like weak and dull recreations and that really bugged me. The New-York of Spider-Man 3 is about the same as before, as is Peter's apartment, The Daily Bugle offices, etc. Peter, Harry, Mary Jane, Aunt May, etc. also carry over well and it's easy to jump back into their lives. Where it doesn't feel like its predecessors is in its pacing and scope. The film tries to tell a lot of story for one film, much more than either the previous installments. This makes it messy. If you took Spider-Man 1 and 2's stories, wove them together and compressed them into one 2 hour film, you'd have a mess pretty similar to Spider-Man 3. A lot of this has to do with poor exposition and the decision to include three villains. In good exposition, events lead to other events and it all seems to flow naturally. Some films end up feeling like a story wasn't really even written, but instead a series of well-crafted scenes that don't necessarily fit well together. A bunch of smaller scenes are then written to connect those scenes. These scenes can feel very forced because they often rely heavily on coincidence. The Matrix Reloaded is full of these contrived scenes and so is Spider-Man 3. They're frustrating because they act like speed bumps where the plot suddenly feels awkward and my enjoyment of the film drops. One scene sticks out particularly in Spider-Man 3 as too awkward. Venom, one of the super-villains, is swinging through alleyways when he is ambushed by the Sandman, another villain. Venom proposes they team to get Spider-Man together, Sandman agrees, end scene. This scene is needed to set up the final, huge battle of the film but just seems poorly worked in. For one it's very short, and two the characters don't know each other and have completely different motives for being villains. That the two would decide that quickly to become partners after coincidentally running into each other is just sloppy to watch.",2007
10,"Even though there is more romance in Spider man 3 it's equaled out with the action that keeps you on the edge of your seat.

Peter now finally comes to terms with being spider-man and knowing that he has a dark side too. Peter find himself asking the New Green Goblin for help fighting the Sandman and Venom.

I'm familiar with the original comics origin story of Venom and all of these characters before they hit movie screens, but I still can't understand some of the hatred and criticism that the film got.

Well, maybe not that close since an ""X-Men"" movie requires the viewer to try to follow the lives of at least a dozen different characters. But I think it was a mistake for the makers to have Spidey contend with three different villains in one film. Unlike the two superior predecessors, it felt like they were trying to cram three movies into one with ""Spider-Man 3"".",2007
10,"Well, let me start by saying that, as many true Spider-Man films fans, I waited for this movie since the very moment I stood up from my seat after watching Spider-man 2. And I'm saying this literally, I am not lying at all, that's exactly the time I've been anxious for this movie to come out, and exactly as I thought, it was extremely amazing, even if I already knew the end of the movie and had unfortunately watched TOOOONSSSSS of spoilers on internet before, but wtf!!! I loved the special effects and to everyone out there who is reading this review let me tell you guys YOU WILL REGRET NOT HAVING WATCHED THIS ON THE THEATERS IF YOU BUY THE DVD WITHOUT HAVING GONE TO THE THEATERS FIRST!!It is extremely cool to see and listen to the movie in the theaters: since the astounding sound of Harry's new glider, to the screaming of Venom and the Sandman which are absolutely amazing sounds!!! I loved so much Church's acting in this movie, he really made me put myself on his position, I could really understand the reasons he had to do what he did, he was simply the best actor in this movie, after Tobey Maguire, OF COURSE!!!! In spite of what most of bad reviews say, I absolutely think he's evolved into an amazing actor, and even if the crying scene wasn't really good, I think it needs a GREAT actor to play to EXTREMELY different roles in one single movie, and that is what Maguire did, and he really shocked when he became aggressive, he just didn't look like him, that was completely cool.",2007
8,"**mild spoilers*** I thought this was a fantastic movie. All of the plots seemed well balanced, the screenplay was outstanding, the score really set the tone for the film and created atmosphere, the acting was at it's best from everyone, the action was outstanding, and overall it was a great, amazing, extraordinary film! The more evil spidey was simply fun to watch. It was a nice change of pace for the character and it really gave the movie its own separate kind of feel. It was different than the first two films. And that was a very good thing.",2007
10,"One of the best things about Marvel comics, at least the golden age of Marvel Comics, is their ability to blend action, comedy, romance and drama into one beautifully enjoyable piece of artwork. The first two Spiderman films managed to being this beauty to life on the big screen, making us laugh, making us cry, making us scream, but most of all, thrilling us with a perfect display of cinematic goodness. So how does Spiderman 3, advertised as the darkest of the films, measure up ti its predecessors. Well bud, if you thought you'd seen it all, you ain't seen nothing' yet.",2007
3,"There are some things that work really well, like the goofy comedy that's also present in the other movies. The movie starts off nicely with a great looking action sequence that implies how great the rest of it could be. The special effects are fantastic. Unfortunately, the movie is so convoluted that anything like a coherent plot is lost, as well as any significant character development further than Harry, Mary Jane or Peter himself.",2007
10,"Jeffrey Donovan is an engaging lead in an interesting program - which combines an interesting dramatic story line with a good balance of lightness and humor -- much like the outstanding ""Monk,"" also a USA Network production.",2007
10,"Last week Thursday was one of those days: The kind that gives you the choice of staring at the ceiling, or perusing your DVR in hopes of finding something worthwhile (but rarely finding anything).",2007
9,"By the end of the first show, the 1-1/2 hour premier, I was hooked. Donovan (remember him from The Pretender?) is charismatic and believable as the spy left out in the cold. I was pleasantly surprised to see Gabrielle Anwar. She starred in a friend's indie film and I wondered what happened to her. And Bruce Campbell.. well who doesn't like him? He adds good depth as Michael Western's grizzled friend. Great cast and sharp writing with Miami serving as a superb backdrop. This series has a load of potential so I'm hoping people will jump on board and start watching. I'm tempted to give it 10/10 as I didn't see anything that I didn't like. I'm looking forward to the new episode tomorrow (Thursday). This show is better than most movies coming out this summer. Great blend of action and humor.",2007
10,When I first heard of the show I didn't know what to think. But then I heard that Bruce was apart of the show so I decided that the whole family should watch. And so we did. And now I crave to know what is going to happen next. The main plot of the show is intriguing but individual stories are just as good. There isn't a flaw in this show. And so far all the episodes are very re-watchable. Which is probably the best part of the show. This show can be enjoyed by most but children under ten won't get the humor and the content is just a little over their head. So if you have children note that they might enjoy the action parts they will get board with the rest of it. All I got to say is watch it and fall in love.,2007
8,"This show has stylish, cheaply made and lots of fun. Donovan has a lot of charisma but Bruce Campbell and the other supporting cast really make this show pop. Miami is great location for this show. In the future it would be cool to see it move around season to season. The show is smartly written and avoids most of the spy standards. It would be nice if they reduced the amount of voice over. It tends to distract from the suspense, but it's not driving me nuts or anything. ",2007
9,This series is one of the best of the year. Michael Donovan is perfect as the Sparta## Ex-Spy turned good guy. I love watching him try to struggle through the emotions of his clients. His relationship with his mother is very strained however you can still see him struggle to not care about his family. Sharon Gless is fun to watch as his chain smoking meddling mother. She's hilarious. Bruce Campbell is a favorite of mine & fits in well with Anwar & Donovan. I'd like to see more from Anwar - I like the changes in accents & would like to see her do more. So far this show has been nothing but entertaining. Donovan can really keep your attention on his stories. I'm looking forward to seeing more.,2007
9,"Very fun, tho' the voice-overs are a bit much at times... and the music/slow-mo/stop-mo action stuff is a bit kitsch (probably the look they were going for).",2007
10,"Before bothering to watch this program, see the update at the bottom of this comment!",2007
10,"USA is the best there is right now for original new television shows. Burn Notice is my new favorite. To me the top TV series right now include Monk, Burn Notice and Psych, among the traditional network giants such as Criminal Minds, NCIS, The Unit, Numbers, the CSI's and Law and Orders. Maybe there is hope to get back to originality rather than the insipid ""reality"" series that perpetually rip each other off. In Burn Notice, the locations are fantastic, the characters original and engaging, the action both intense and amusing, and the whole thing moves so fast you can't wait until the next week. Thank God for DVRs, but for the first time I am recording the traditional shows and watching the USA series real-time!",2007
10,"I'm not very faithful when it comes to television, I work a full time job and a home business. For me to watch a show it has to be beyond good. Burn Notice is that show.",2008
8,"Burn Notice gets right to the point, giving the viewer an example of how Michael Weston's life has been over the last few years. And then turns it upside down, setting the pace for a great first episode. The cast of this show is terrific. Jeffrey Donovan, coming out of nowhere with that ""I have seen him before."" feeling, makes a completely believable and competent spy. He brings a very flawed, human element to the character that is very balanced in such away that almost puts us in that situation but, it could easily be pushed to one extreme or the other that has been seen in other shows of this genre. Meaning that Michael could seem to caring, making him not believable as a professional spy or not caring enough, making him not someone you can sympathize with. Jeffrey also has a very charming way about him which helps to make Michael a very likable character. The most notable of the supporting cast is Sam, played expertly by Bruce Campbell, a retired spy and old friend of Michael's living it up in Miami. The interaction between these two is very believable and enjoyable to watch. The only problem I have with the supporting cast is Fiona. Gabrielle Anwar is not a bad choice to play the ex girlfriend of Michael and former IRA terrorist, but seeing as Gabrielle is from England I would think that she would be able to pull of a more believable Irish accent. At any rate I highly recommend this show, it has some great potential. Tune and see if we can't give it a chance to shine.",2007
8,"The name is Michael Westen(Donovan, using intensity, charm and even vulnerability, and of course his actual martial arts chops, to give us a compelling protagonist. He's made relatable through, among other things, his family, his sympathy for those in a bad spot). He used to be a spy. Until a burn notice was put out, claiming he was an unreliable asset. Every last of his accounts are frozen, his colleagues forced to reject him, and he's put on watchlists that will prevent him from leaving his home city of Miami. The only way he can get his life back is for him to figure out the who, why and, well, what, exactly, of this, well, what we civilians would call getting laid off. And along the way, he will help countless of regular people with problems that his skillset, and not the police or the like, enable him to solve.",2016
8,"I really enjoy this new series and never really gave it any thought primarily because every character is so red in color ( I understand it's based in Miami) but honestly I thought there was something wrong with my color. I tend to watch Law and Order but I also like old school Magnum P.I. The show itself is great, but everyone seems to be too red. I love the characters and the story. This almost reminds me of a smarter newer Mac Gyver. Apparently I need to submit 10 lines of comments to send this e-mail, but that's all I wanted to say. Love the show (Or I would have never commented) but thought that the characters are so bright red...something you would see in an older t.v. series. Minor things...keep up the good story lines and I hope I didn't make too much of this minor observation. Thank you for your time, Jennifer",2008
10,"This series - although it has a 'spy' plot - is amazingly captivating. Donovan is truly fascinating!! I've been watching Burn Notice and trying to figure out why he looked familiar and I finally had to look it up here...he was on an episode of Monk in which he played a totally unlikeable character. I cannot believe this is the same actor!! Donovan even affects a slight accent for this series...or he dropped it for Monk. Anyway - to me, the barely there accent implies a slightly European side to Donovan's character, which lends credibility to his wordly spy persona. ",2007
8,"After completing episode 4 just now, I'm hooked. I think I'll probably finish the series tonight. Don't judge it on the pilot episode alone though because although good, it's the weakest of those that I've seen.",2008
10,Excellent entertainment. I've read all the other comments/critiques and agree wholeheartedly.,2007
8,Clever and humorous. TV needs this show. USA scored with Monk and topped themselves with Burn Notice. It's fun enough for all audiences and smart enough for the picky viewer.,2007
7,"Michael Westen just got burned! That's spy lingo for fired, except no body told him he was fired or that his credit rating was trashed or that all his savings were frozen with a government code attached to them or that he was deposited someplace he does not want to be (Miami). When I first saw the previews of this show I though this must be a junk like so much else that comes on TV these days. Looked like an interesting premise so I watched the pilot. Maybe not worth all the hype but the show does have several redeeming qualities. Number one is the actor who plays Westen. Mr. Donovan is a likable rogue and during the course of the hour he does grow on you. The script has a mix of tongue in cheek dialog with a bit of Mac Guyver thrown in. After being fired from the agency Michael tried to find out why and in the process takes on a job of a private investigator for some living expenses. In the course of his investigation, he is helped by his former girlfriend , Fiona, who is ex- IRA and who is played with great ease by Gabrielle Anwar. The scene where she puts away the local drug dealer's muscle is priceless. She's very well cast. Michael's nemesis is not the CIA agents who are constantly watching him but his hypochondriac mother who has the disease of the week syndrome played by Sharon Gless.",2007
3,Most over-rated show on television.,2011
2,"People were telling me how great this show is, and thought I would check it out. I got through the entire first season hoping at some point it would get better, but it never did. I watched the first episode and a half of season two and just couldn't take it any more.",2009
7,"When Burn Notice first started airing, it was a fresh, clever show with dynamic characters and an interesting concept (it was a sort of spy show in ""tilt"" mode). Early on, the writers and actors did a great job of balancing serious situations with a sense of humor (the only show that rivaled Burn Notice in that regard was NCIS). ",2013
9,"This is a very cool, stylish show - sort of a Sam Spade meets The Equalizer with some Bond thrown in the mix. The cast really pulls every thing together and really works as an ensemble. Donovan, like bond looks like he was born in his tailor made suit. Anwar is ripped hottie and adds a lot of dimension to the usual bimbo fare. And who doesn't love Bruce Campbell - come on if he can't make you laugh, no one can.",2008
10,A gem on the network.,2008
7,"When I first walked into the movie, my expectations were not very high. The first two movies, I thought, were the best of the series mainly due to Richard Harris' dead-on portrayal of Dumbledore and screenplays that closely followed the original books. Though the third and fourth movies were very artistic and dramatic, I couldn't really connect to them in the way i had with the books. They glossed over many of the little things that made the Harry Potter series so magical in the first place, focusing on a select few plot lines and limiting dialog to only what was necessary to further the story. ",2007
10,"OK. Yes stuff was left out. Yes some things were inaccurate. And yes, at times the story jumped around. But I'll tell you what, if that's the price to pay for being able to see fantastic literature on the big-screen...I'll take a few inconsistencies any day.",2007
1,"I have read and enjoyed all 7 Harry potter novels, and I watched and enjoyed the first 2 films, Azkaban and GOF were OK but not good. This however was awful, and when I say awful I really mean awful. I was genuinely on the verge of walking out of the theatre after about 30 minutes, the only reason I sat through this was because of my wife.",2007
4,"For those of you looking for a faithful adaptation of Order of the Phoenix, this film isn't it. How director David Yates got the go to direct completely baffles me. Not since Chris Columbus' stilted pacing has a HP film disappointed me. I realize that in a book as rich in detail as the HP series something is bound to be left out in the film version, but the direction and editing of this film leave much to be desired.",2007
1,"I simply do not understand how anyone could have enjoyed this movie. As a standalone work without reference to the book it was dull, yet glitzy, incomprehensible drivel. It became almost impossible for someone who had not read the texts to understand a thing, especially for one who had not before seen the films. Many characters were never introduced and there was no significant character development nor was there real motivation for actions given.",2007
2,THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!! CAUTION!!!,2007
1,"Yates, be ashamed. Goldenberg, be ashamed. This is the worst HP movie a die hard fan had to sit through. To start off, just because the movie is an adaptation of the book does not mean it should leave out entire story lines, change others, and expose only those that will glitter and impress those who have not read the book. Lord of the Rings... ring a bell, followers of the book... did it stray as much from the books as OOTP did? Now for serious talk, whoever decided that Grawp should look like a 20' middle-aged man with Down's Syndrome should be tortured for the rest of their life. Not only did Grawp look slow, but behaved, moved, and got the audience's sympathy NOT how the book describes him at all. And how about entire chunks of the book thrown away for a cheap (but likely profitable) movie? How about being 3/4 through the book in 60 minutes? How about Kreacher, 2 scenes? How about Sirius' mother's portrait? How about Quidditch? How about the Patronus charm being ""very advanced magic"" yet the director felt every character needed an animal? How about classes, wizard clothing, Diagon Alley... is Hogwart's set in London now for some reason? How about Harry is the only one that does lines in Umbridge's office (so as to isolate him further from his friends in his loneliness)? How about Firenze taking over Divination, showing that it is not a lost art and course? How about Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes, the twins' decision making, the money Harry gave them to open up their shop? How about knowing the names of the escaped convicts, was it going to cost too much to PRINT 10 names of the villains who are in the finale on the Prophet? I realize this is a film ""based"" on the book, but to be able to say that the movie should reflect at least 50% of the book, if the craptacular disappointment duo of Yates/Goldenberg sign on for Half Blood Prince, I hope I am not alone in wishing them to buy a few extra letter openers for the ""angry"" mail they will certainly receive. If another duo appears, my advice is to stick to the book, even Mel Gibson did that...",2007
8,"I actually was lucky enough to see this at a sneak preview on Monday. The ""experience"" was lousy, but the film was good...IF you take it as a separate entity from the series of books. If you separate the film from the book, you won't be disappointed.",2007
10,"Why do Harry Potter movies give me, but not the children, nightmares? I've been wondering this for the past few years. Today, watching Movie No. 5, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Warner Bros., 2007), I got my answer. Simply: Harry's world is the real world. As Harry and his friends mature, the line between the world of wizardry, magic, and Hogwarts and the world of self-centered, manipulative, cruel adults thins to the point of almost magical invisibility.",2007
4,Our family waited for six hours to get in to see this film at the midnight showing and wish we had gotten a good night sleep instead! I am only grateful that we weren't stupid enough to wait until the 3:15 am showing in 3D! So much was missing from the film that it hardly made sense to the members of our family who have not read the book and those of us that have read it were upset about what was missing and angry about what had been shoved together.,2007
9,Within the first 5 minutes you can tell the series has undergone a dramatic tone shift and I have to say I think thats appropriate since Voldemorts return at the end of Goblet of Fire means that it's time to put aside childish things. The big bad men are here and they don't care about hurting children. it's time to get nasty.,2007
2,I feel cheated. I really do. Too much omitted this time.,2007
5,"I love the Harry Potter books, and I've always liked the movies. That's why I was very excited to go see the latest installment of the series. However the movie did not at all live up to my expectations; to me it felt rushed and choppy. I realize that Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was a very long book, but so was The Goblet of Fire and I enjoyed it's movie adaptation a lot. In this movie seemed as though the director merely had a check list of scenes that he needed to but in the movie put no thought into connecting them. The speed and choppiness of the movie took away from the characters. It was just events and there was hardly any character development at all. Which was a shame because the young cast continues to get better, and there were some amazing acting veterans (Gary Oldman, Ralph Fiennes, Helena Bonham Carter etc.) In my opinion if the director had slowed everything down, only a little, he could've added a lot more (character development, humor, fluidity) However, despite by prier comments, the movie was not terrible. It did have it's good moments, but I think it could have been done a lot better.",2007
1,"First of all, i want to comment on the high points of the movie. I think the acting was great, the characters looked great, and the way they played out their parts were great. I like how Bellatrix looked and acted, it really gave you the feel for the type of character she is. On another note, the parts they cut out were parts most people were probably excited for. The circular room not being there? Honestly, why cut out one of the most interesting parts of the movie? The brain room, and the other rooms were important keys to the excitement of the movie. Also the fact that none of the children were hurt like in the book was a little overrated. Yes, this is a child's movie, but including an unconscious Hermione, Neville's broken nose, Ron being attacked by the brains and Ginny's broken ankle wouldn't have been too disgusting. Also the fight at the end between Dumbledore and Voldemort was cheap because it did not happen like it should have in the book. Neville and Harry should have been the only people in the veil room when the Death eaters were threatening for the prophecy and Bellatrix didn't even use Crucio on Neville like she does in the book to get the prophecy. The prophecy wasn't supposed to be heard till the 6th book. It was supposed to say the prophecy when it breaks. Siruis' death went way too fast, Harry didn't even mourn it. And what was up with the absence of the two way mirrors? That was such an emotional, important part of the story. Knowing that if he would have used the mirror instead of rushing out. Why was there no Marietta? In the book Cho never told, Hermione jinxed the list to put boils on the persons face. There was no dating between Harry and Cho. There was no DA coins to tell of the meetings. How are they going to do the 6th movie where Malfoy says ""i used Grangers idea with the coin, like the DA used to talk with the death eaters without being intercepted"" if there was no coins! And Harry breaking into Snapes mind instead of dipping his head into the penseive was stupid. Not to mention they cut the memory way too short. And didn't even have Lily stick up for him. It was cheap. ",2007
2,"Well I just saw OotP, and the only actors I would keep would be Jason Isaacs, Helena Bonham-Carter, Gary Oldman, George Harris, Brendan Gleeson, David Thewlis and Alan Rickman.",2007
2,"When I first saw the previews for Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, I was giddy because i actually thought that OOTP would be magical, amazing, and action-packed. How ignorant i was. Now i know it is a 870 page book but if a fantasy movie based on a book is going to be done right, it calls for a longer movie or the possibility of doing a part two. Trying to cram all this information in two hours makes the audience member feel incredibly stuffed and congested. The cameras were too fast, actors spoke their lines too fast. Probably the greatest example is the scene where Severus gets his pants pulled down by James. A great scene in the book but turned into five seconds of incoherence in the movie. Uncle Vernon is a yeller, plain and simple. He did not shout once in OOTP. And when did Dudley become a gangster? Why did Flitwick, who looked normal in the first two films, become a guy with black hair and moustache? That's not Flitwick and his arm pump is not something he would do (although i must admit it was hilarious). George and Fred deserved a bigger finish. Sure the fireworks were OK, but in the book how the were cornered and they grab their brooms, talk to peeves, and escape. That was a finish. Now i understand that the films are becoming darker and more sinister and stuff. And because they're so creative, they make the set and the movie more visually darker to convey this metaphor. However, as an audience member, i want to see the faces of the actors and set. Having the centaur scene with no lines and unable to see things clearly makes it look disorientated and confusing. Actors and actresses that make a grand appearance in the book would get more time in the movie. If i didn't read the books and saw Tonks doing her pig and duck thing i would seriously be like ""WTF?"" Seriously, people who are not die-hard fans need to be explained things. You would think they would explain the prophecy a bit better with Neville and all, but no they couldn't take the time to do that. They just made silly mistakes. Poking a dementor in the eye when it is choking you? Seriously now. And what happened to Quidditch? It was action packed and amazing in the first two films, but yet again, they succeeded in taking away the magic that made the first two films fabulous. I believed the final battle would be breath-taking but was I robbed on that notion. Like the movie, the prophecy room was tight and overcrowded. No brain room? And it wasn't avada kedarva that killed sirius. However, i grow tired of complaining about this movie. Hopefully people will just read the book instead, which unlike the movie, is good.",2007
1,"Any Harry Potter movie is a special event, so we chose Washington DC's finest movie theater, the UPTOWN, with its giant Cinerama curved screen and superior stereo, laid down our $8 per ticket, and expected the best.",2007
1,May Contain Spoilers,2007
2,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix surpassed even my lowest expectations for the film. The movies have been steadily declining since the third movie. It's not that they're bad just standing alone, but as they are based on the phenomenal books by J K Rowling they should at least try to stick somewhat close to them. This however almost never happens, it's as though the director just wants to make his film and get his money, it doesn't do the books justice in the least. I left the theater fuming because of all the changes made to the books. I'm not naive, I understand that a lot must be taken out to fit the time length but good God they could have shortened the 10 minute broom ride in the beginning and used it to make the confrontation in Dumbledore's office a little more accurate, or they could have added the rest of the rooms in the Department of Mysteries which were noticeably absent. Those were the 2 parts of the films that I was actually looking forward to seeing but was yet again disappointed. Instead of hexing every person trying to take him to Azkaban,as is written, Dumbledore simply grabs Fawkes the phoenix and disappears...ooh wow wonderful...God! Also, the Department of Mysteries was almost a joke in itself...apart from the missing rooms the fight between the students/Order and the eaters was also sub par. I just saw flashes of wands as the people just flew around attempting to kill each other, it was an incoherent mess. There are other major flaws in the movies but i don't have to time or patience to discuss them at the moment. If you are going to see the movie and haven't read the books or aren't extremely familiar with them, then the movie will probably be very good to you, however if you are like me, and have read the books multiple times, lower your expectations for the film and grit your teeth, you'll probably leave disappointed.",2007
9,"Once again, I believe that the series is only getting better with each progressive movie. I attended a preview screening tonight and was completely blown away by the movie. While quite a bit of detail was lost in the movie, how can you really expect a three hour movie to capture what takes Rowling hundreds of pages to explain? This said, Yates did a great job capturing the spirit of the book, and he had me on my seat from the first scene all the way through the end of the movie. I cried, I laughed, and I am pretty sure there were a few times where I couldn't breathe from the tension.",2007
9,"For the avid Harry Potter reader the whole suspense leading up to HP Order of the Phoenix can be summed up in the word ""how"". How are they going to translate a nearly 900 page book to the screen, how are they going to tie together a storyline that in the 5th book breaks into dozens of streams like a mighty river coming to its delta.",2007
4,"I am the biggest Potter fan that I know, and i can honestly say that i HATED this movie. The acting was a touch better and the effects were up to their normal standard, but the complex, involved plot that the novel provides was completely butchered on screen. I do understand that they cannot include every detail of an 800+ page book, but certain obvious details, such as Lily Evans in Snape's memory, any mention of Neville's inclusion in the prophecy, the two-way mirror from Sirius, the locket in Grimmauld Place, Regulus Black...these details are important to future plots. They SHOULD make an appearance. The story doesn't make any sense without them. The memory itself, my favorite scene in all six books so far, is all of twenty seconds and the only characters you see clearly are James and Severus. Bellatrix says Avada Kedavra to kill Sirius. There is a reason JK Rowling did not specify the name of that jet of light that killed Sirius, and by putting the no-returns-possible Avada Kedavra on it squashes any sort of believable return from him in future. While still visually appealing, and though it hurts to type it, the film is, overall, terrible. You can't make excuses for the plot-moving details that were left on the cutting room floor.",2007
5,"As a very dedicated Harry Potter fan, I have very high, sometimes unfair, expectations for the movies. It was not a terrible movie, but it was definitely the worst adapation yet and very fast paced and under explained. To the person who has not read the books, and only seen the movies they may be lost/easily confused as to what is happening. I expected that they would leave out many things, and I had already forgiven them for that before I entered the theatre. What bothered me the most was the fact that they couldn't seem to set on a mood. It seemed like the movie was confused as to whether it was supposed to be a comedy or a drama. They added in American one line humour, changed some of the plot lines around, and failed to make Harry seem more than a cardboard person. The CGI effects are amazing, the soundtrack is great and will put you in the mood. However, be warned that : Quidditch was taken out of the movie, Draco was reduced to a cameo appearance, Hermoine is unlike herself, and it seemed to drag on towards the end.",2007
1,"This movie could not have been more of a let down! I wasn't expecting much from this film, I have grown to understand the movies can not be as detailed as the books, but really. This film should have been the Empire Strikes Back of the series, with a few great bits of action and lots and lots of set up with a OK pay off that left you counting the days till the next film. Instead we get a VERY VERY VERY watered down version of the story, with changes so people with a short attention span don't have to remember anything about this film for the next one. At least with the last 4 films the story was the underscore to the action or special effects, with this one none of that came across. This film turned into a disjointed grouping of odd scenes with nothing really to 1. set the time line of the over all film and 2. does nothing to forward the ongoing story of good vs. evil.",2007
1,"I was very disappointed in the movie, if you read any of the book you found yourself wondering if you walked into the wrong film. I have just returned home from the 12:01 showing of the film and I can't believe that I will never get those two hours of my life back. I had my reservations about some of the actors chosen to play the characters (Umbridge, Tonks, Luna) but these portrayals were not bad, Tonks because you really have no idea who she is, she is only in 2 scenes. Trelawney was sacked before Christmas, all Weasley products were banned by a decree, (apparently Umbridge was way ahead of us all because Weasley products don't really come out until book 6)Grimmauld place is never cleaned during the holidays, so the locket that is so crucial to book 7 never shows itself as being in the house, I could go on and on. It makes me wonder if anyone at Warner Bros has read the book, and how in the world JKR let this movie be made. On the other hand, 3 of the people who went with me had never read the books and they thought that the movie was great, action packed.",2007
10,"Im an American girl who watches every Graham show aired. I DVR them ALL. He has become my favorite 60min of every day. I have never laughed so hard at any talk show in my 44 years. The love of my life promised me that when we set a date to marry, we WILL be in Grahams studio at one of his shows.Love this guy and I promise that you will too. I rented his Best of the Graham Norton Show from Netflix. My sister and brother-in-law were visiting from Fla. and had never even heard of Graham. After they watched the video they said they were going to check and see if they get the BBC in the south. I have made fans out of them. I hope they can share the laughs with their friends as I have. Keep up the fantastic work Graham, and I look forward to seeing you in person on my honeymoon.",2010
9,"This talk show is great value. Very funny with first class guests. Norton is attentive, witty, flattering without being insincere, and genuinely interested in his guests. Very few guests come across as boring or uncomfortable but the editing is sharp, and if one guest is firing, they tend to focus on them. The format is near perfect, with the interviews interspersed with very creative audience participation segments, stunts the guests are asked to do, and performances by fantastic rock bands at the end. Among the show's negatives is that there are few women guests. Sometimes Norton jokes about British celebrities that viewers in the US or Australia won't have heard of. And Norton's jokes sometimes veer towards the smutty. Sometimes he gets so risqué the more conservative American guests are clearly shocked, but it can be funny when Norton throws in a naughty observation.",2015
10,"I can't believe I found this gem. One day I caught huge names on the screen while flipping through the channels! This show has bigger stars on his show than any American show. Mr Billionv$$$ man Tom Cruise to be found in all his sexy glory on this show? Yes he's ""quasi promoting"" The 2014 Edge of Tomorrow--but this is a dream for me and by listening to some female screams in the audience, others as well. Tom is an amazing actor, producer, director and has been delighting us with fantastic films for decades. I was hooked @ ""Legend"" had no idea who this guy was but that film is still in my dreams decades later.. Fassbender-Barry Manilow, Jean Gautier ICONS? Legends Real stars letting loose, actually I dislike when they try to remain composed.Prefer them realizing they don't have to deal with American paparazzi-",2014
10,This is the best talk show ever. Graham is a funny likable host that doesn't make the show all about him. He makes his guests the center of attention. I love how the guests are on all at once. I love watching the biggest stars in Hollywood interact with each other. This show is Very Original - Graham Norton does not ask his guests questions they constantly get ask. He asks original questions - over all his show is original. Never copies other shows but it's other shows that copy him - Tom Hanks said this as well,2017
8,"I used to love the host of this new chat show on occasion in his Channle 4 programmes, So and V, and being against the likes of Jonathan Ross and Parkinson at the time, it was interesting to see this try and rival. BAFTA winning, and British Comedy Award nominated Graham Norton here gets his own regular style chat show, no camp and over the top sexual comedy involved, there would be the occasional breakaway, but that's all. The show would star with a few jokes about recent events and the guests featuring, two or three guests are brought in to talk about and promote/plug their recent venture in film, music, television or whatever else, including past career, there would be a musical performance by a singer or band, and the final part I will explain soon.

My favourite part of the show (technically a main reason for me to watch) is the red chair (originally called ""That's All We've Got Time For), where a member of the studio audience sits down, obviously Graham finds out their name, where their from and what they do, and they have a short story or anecdote to tell that has to be interesting and funny, and if they start to bore Graham and the audience he has a lever by his side to pull and eject them backwards off the chair, if they do have a good story they are allowed to walk. Very good!",2011

5,"I don't know how the producers/bookers of this show keep doing it. Every week they seem to get the best guests. OK, so I know they're only on to promote their book/film/album, but at least they're on our screens.",2016
7,The tagline of this movie is perfect... because it describes exactly what Meet the Robinsons means for the Disney Feature Animation studios... a step forward. Disney had been on a slide in the last few years... they were beginning to make cheap comedy movies with thin characters and story lines. I am happy to report that those days are over.,2007
7,"I'm writing reviews for a German movie website and thus got into a press screening of the new CG animated Disney movie ""Meet the Robinsons"" in Munich a little while ago. I'm a big animation fan myself and love many of the old Disney movies, although lately I've been more impressed with Pixar's films than anything Disney had to offer in the last few years. However, the story of this one is actually quite interesting and not as uninspired and generic as Disney's last traditionally animated feature Home on the Range or as messy as their first CG outing Chicken Little. It offers a number of nice surprises and even a good plot twist or two without causing too much of the old time-traveling headache. The humor also works quite well, although many of the jokes seem to be aimed at adults and little kids might not get all of them. (Didn't bother me, though) Most importantly, this film does not contain a single fart joke nor any talking animals or even animal sidekicks (except for those singing frogs you might have seen in the trailers, but they're really not the same thing). I don't know how close this adaptation is to William Joyce's novel ""A Day With Wilbur Robinson"", as I've never read anything Joyce has written, but it all works pretty well and manages to be an exiting and entertaining family adventure movie.",2007
10,"Somewhere Walt Disney must be smiling. ""Meet the Robinsons"" is the perfect, unlikely marriage of manic, absurd humor, eye-popping visuals and honest-to-goodness emotional depth. It is a close cousin to the first ""Back to the Future,"" yet it feels completely original at the same time. The 3-D animation works seamlessly within the story. It is not played for a cheesy gimmick (like, for example, ""Spy Kids 3-D""...groan). In fact, it is so well integrated into the narrative that you could almost take it for granted, so it's a good thing that at the heart of ""Meet the Robinsons"" there is a wonderfully entertaining story. In typical Disney fashion the central character is a motherless (and in this case, fatherless) youth -- however this time it is not merely a device whose sole purpose is to leave him unencumbered to embark on his own adventure. In fact, his orphaned status and quest to find the mother that left him at the orphanage as a baby IS the point of his journey. But there's no room for sugary sap here, thanks to an almost unending stream of quirky characters and plot twists. Of course stories like this can't succeed without a great villain. In this case the filmmakers have managed to craft a bumbling villain who is simultaneously hilarious, sympathetic and just menacing enough to keep the tension going. He reminded me of Snidely Whiplash, Mack the Knife, and the magician from Rankin-Bass' ""Frosty the Snowman,"" all rolled into one.",2007
8,"I went to the theater this afternoon to catch an R-rated film and goofed on the times. The only movie available in my time frame allowed was Meet the Robinsons. I reluctantly bought a ticket and was pleasantly rewarded with a movie experience that reminded me very much of my childhood. When we got to go to the movies in the 50's and 60's, there were trailers, followed by the newsreel and then a cartoon before the main attraction. The non-three D version started with non-R rated trailers, followed by a Mickey Mouse cartoon (loved it!) and then the main feature. It was very entertaining to sit back and relax and not worry about the good guys dying, the amount of slaughter that would be portrayed, or that there wouldn't be a positive message at the end. As an adult, there were enough references to keep me entertained and from the sounds of the kids in the theater, they were obviously enjoying this movie. I would highly recommend it to all but the crankiest movie-goers, and I personally loved the quote from Uncle Walt at the end of the movie. When I was little, our whole family watched Walt Disney every Sunday and I particularly remember when it changed to Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color. Walt Disney was a man ahead of his time and I really miss his adventurous spirit and inquisitive mind. He introduced and ended each episode and I really enjoyed seeing him every week. I wish that Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color was still on every week and that new episodes would still be made.",2007
7,"I saw an advance screening of 'Meet The Robinsons' today with the family and all of us thoroughly enjoyed it. After getting a bit sick of recent CGI animal flicks (with the possible exception of Flushed Away), this was a refreshing change.",2007
10,"Outside of the beautiful faces that I helped to create and another that made an honest man of me...I truly loathe most everything that passes as...anything, truly. I took two of my sons and a young friend of theirs to see Meet The Robinsons, today. Having never wanted to shout anything from a mountain top - let me just offer up a piece of advice for anyone looking for something uplifting, inspirational - heartbreaking but re-affirming...you must see this movie. I'm a braveheart guy, I love goodfellas and Will Ferrell movies - I'm an idiot; but I can't imagine hearing more beautiful words come out of my sons mouth than when we left the theatre and hearing him say ""that movie made me feel good about myself"". Poetry - from the mouth and mind of someone who doesn't know any better - or any worse. The movie is about - and this isn't a spoiler - family and caring for someone other than yourself. It isn't standard Disney stuff - even though that sounds EXACTLY like standard Disney. I'm running out space and I'm not completely making the most sense which is exactly how I feel at 37 anyway....",2007
8,"The Robinsons is a one weird family. It takes time to know them, and once you do, you will like them.",2007
8,"Was a little ""ify"" about taking my 5 and 2 year old daughter's to this movie. Actually was concerned that it may not hold their attention. Based on some reviews, I honestly didn't think I would care for it.",2007
9,"A heartwarming story with eye-popping 3D special effects. If you have the option of seeing this in 3D, you should opt for it. The story is strong, so you will enjoy it either way, but since 3D is a rare instance in this day & age, you should go that route. This movie has a stellar cast that may not be the big A-list names like the Dreamworks movies, but they are very talented and well cast in their roles. I prefer the subtlety of casting for quality versus stunt casting, and this movie delivered. You can tell that John Lasseter played an important role in this movie - ""Cars"" delivered the message that the journey is more important than the destination and ""Meet the Robinsons"" delivers a message about not living in the past...keep moving forward. John Lasseter should be commended for helping lift Disney features back to their glory days. I will be the first to admit that they are not there yet, but with his help and movies that focus on the story & the characters like ""Meet the Robinsons"", we won't have long to wait...",2007
10,"""Meet the Robinsons"" is just superb in every way - plot, animation, characters, substance, and music. All put together in an astoundingly gorgeous film - easily enjoyed by ALL ages. Clever, clever humor and wit - many things that only adults may understand. Loved the way the story progresses and how it ends.",2007
9,"For much of this film, even though I was being entertained by it, I thought it was geared mostly for kids.....and that's fine. That's what I always thought the target audience was in animated films. I just got spoiled with so many good ones in the last few years that also had a lot of funny material that adults enjoyed, too. Films like ""Cars,"" ""Madagascar,"" ""Barnyard."" ""Chicken Little,"" ""The Polar Express,"" and so forth. Well, in the end, I have nothing but praise for this film, too, because it had some touching qualities to it that would emotionally involve a person of any age. ",2008
1,"Now for the truth, its very very weak storyline - for a Walt Disney film its total rubbish. When the robinson appear, the films all over the place, I was shocked how poor it was. It like ""alice in wonderland"" gone wrong!. It feels like they were short on ideas some mashed some crazy rubbish together to try and get away with it - and they don't. After that, I sat there wishing for the end. My younger brother lost interest half way through and was confused by the story. The characters are weak and after the robinsons appear you don't care about the ending, you just want the film to finish. Its a film to forget, and forget quickly. If you've got some spare time, don't waste it on this.",2007
5,This film is about Disney's very future.,2007
1,"This movie started out with some semblance of a plot, then abandoned it for an endless series of random characters and encounters that have nothing to do with moving the story forward. It was impossible to remain engaged with this film. This movie is a very cynical pile of garbage made by some people with animation skills but totally lacking in creativity or storytelling ability. It is a shockingly bad effort coming from a major studio. Clearly there are morale and motivation problems at Disney, not to mention a complete lack of oversight and quality control. That management allowed this movie to see the light of day speaks volumes about their incompetence and desperation. This movie joins my very short ""worst movies of all time"" list.",2008
3,"I went to see this with my wife and 3 yr old son. He seemed to like it a lot more than my wife and I did. The writing is surprisingly poor for a pixar / Disney excursion. In fact, I had a very hard time paying attention at all. The movie does look amazing but the story just becomes so weird and long winded that I was hoping my son would fall asleep so I could pick him up and walk out.",2007
7,"I just saw this film on 25th of March with the 3D glasses in an advanced screening here in Australia. This film is extremely colorful and will send a powerful message to kids (keep moving forward). Im 21 years old and i wouldn't say there is much in this for adults, there is the odd joke here and there but it isn't the sort of ""shrek"", ""toy story"" movie where it is for everyone.",2007
10,"Last year I saw some animated monstrosity at a drive-in theater. It was completely insipid, unfunny and dull. If anyone liked it had to be a kid and a kid who scarfs down paint chips. Throw in the voice of Ray Ramano and you will know why I was cringing in the backseat until the the movie's complete awfulness compelled me to leave. The only other time I left a drive-in theater was when a tornado was in the area.",2007
8,"I saw this movie a little over a week ago and I thought it was a pretty cute Disney film about the future of tomorrow. Meet the Robbinsons is one of those animated films where it has humor for the adults and the kids that works well and really clicked, not to mention the animation looked fantastic. While it's still not the best animated film this year, I would agree that it's in the top and wouldn't be surprised if it does get an Oscar nod for best animated film. It really was that good, I was kinda surprised by the average rating on IMDb, I thought the users would get a kick out of this film, but you can't win them all.",2007
4,"The most important things about animated feature films are are they suitable for children,and are children entertained by them?Meet the Robinsons is no question suitable for children,and my children,as well as other children present in the theater today,were entertained by it.I suppose in that regard,the film does it's job with flying colors.I regret to say that from an adult standpoint,it comes up profoundly short of the mark.While the animation is above average,the story,at least in my opinion,is (for lack of a better term) boring.It has its slightly humorous moments where I would give a slight chuckle,but I am afraid that's about it.The only bright spot for me was the five minute cartoon that preceded the feature,a tradition that this 40 something movie goer is glad to see resurrected,if only briefly.My advice is to wait for this film to be released on DVD.Rent it,perhaps even buy it for your kids.They will enjoy it.Adults? Meet the Parents,Meet the Fokkers,Meet the Feebles,Meet the Press,Meet anybody but the Robinsons.",2007
3,"I really wanted to like this film, but so much of it is stolen/borrowed from other work -- some of the borrowing is painfully blatant. The New York Times' review pointed out that their singing frog is awfully reminiscent of the one in the famous Warner Brothers' cartoon ('Hello my baby, hello my darlin', hello my ragtime gal...'). But I challenge anyone to watch the Fox/Blue Sky animated feature Robots (2005) and not find ridiculous similarities in: storyline - A young inventor growing up, and a single innovative corporation distributes all great inventions.",2007
6,"It could have been that kind of quite stupid, quite meaningless but watchable Disney CGI as Chicken Little: very fast, full of possibilities, full of ideas thrown on the screen, full of jokes that partly fall flat... Actually, it still is (except from the flat jokes). But John Lasseter changed it a year ago. As we know, he told the director he didn't like the bad guy (didn't find him too scary) and didn't understand why the main character was an orphan. 'Because I was an orphan too', the director said, so Lasseter asked him, okay, then make us feel what it means to you, being an orphan. So he did. The result? The movie got depth - the scenes about being an orphan and getting a new family are really quite touching. The bad guy's sidekick became really evil with own diabolic plans - well, I think it created a little bit too dark aspect to this mainly pastel-colored kids' movie. There is one scene where we can see the evil sidekick's world; it looks like a scene stolen right from the floor of the editing room of The Matrix, and the family our hero loves turns into a group of kind of zombies for a minute. Even if it is not without reason (this way we can feel how much is at stake), it is simply too much, too dark. ",2007
1,"Child abandonment and apocalyptic themes...good family fun, huh? The movie opens with a child abandonment scene which immediately made me uneasy. I had my three children with me, of course.",2007
1,"I kinda liked the film despite it's frenzied pace. BUT, I did not appreciate the comment that Canada was referred to as Montana North. It is definitely NOT Montana North and never will be. Americans wonder why they are perceived as arrogant in the rest of the world, and that is one reason why. Stop teaching the kids of the United States of America to think they own the planet. Such a centrist world view is not becoming of one of the world's great nations. Even in jest. I would never refer to the USA as 'Alberta South'. Walt would never put us down, so why start now. Other than that the film was pretty goofy, better luck next time.",2007
8,"In recent years, I've come to the conclusion that, as far as American studios are concerned, Pixar is the only one producing great CGI-animated films. However, its always a delight to be proved wrong, and I am surprised to find that 'Meet the Robinsons (2007)' is a truly terrific science-fiction children's film, one that exceeded all my expectations. Produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios, with John Lasseter as one of the executive producers {so it's not so far from Pixar, after all!}, the film is my most unexpected favourite of 2007, boasting a fresh and intelligent screenplay, as well as impressive 3D visuals. Though the film deals with time travel, a rather sophisticated concept in itself, director Stephen J. Anderson ensures that the plot is straightforward to follow, approaching the notion of paradoxes in a manner than is easy for children to understand without being exasperating for adults. In addition to a terrific script {which is credited to about seven screenwriters}, 'Meet the Robinsons' also has a motivational maxim from which we can all take something: ""keep moving forward!""",2008
7,"My first big question is: - Was this movie originally produced in French? It seemed to me that the Lip-sync was totally English, although I was told that it was produced in French. Technology has improved so much, so please let me know. The action scenes were fantastic. Very interesting storyline, but it was funny how they all dropped their guns and fought with their hands. I liked Olyphant for Agent 47, but I think he could have showed more action. He was a bit laughable at times. However, it was fun looking at the film. I did not expect too much when I started looking at the movie, but I must say that the action was placed at the right time, so it kept me interested. I also liked very much the girl, Nika, if I did, then I am sure she was a favourite.",2012
6,"As contradictory as it may sound, finding a good mindless action movie is actually a rather challenging task. Luckily we live in a world where adapting stories and characters from mindless action video games is commonplace, and the creators of the Hit-man movie have gone to great lengths to showcase plenty of the blood, bullets, and babes requisite of a proper translation of the popular assassin adventure.",2007
7,"Being a big fan of the Hit-man games, I was fairly worried when I heard that they were going to make a movie based on it because movies based on video games don't tend to be very good movies...",2007
10,"Let's keep this short and sweet. If you enjoy the video games, you will more than likely enjoy the movie. It's very easy to follow, the acting can be downright terrible at times (but very solid from Olyphant who was a GREAT choice to play Agent 47), the special FX are loud and neat to look at, there's lots of explosive action-packed gun fights, and the hot chick gets naked. The only thing I have against the film was that it was a little dull and awkward in the beginning, but it picked up about 15 minutes in and kept it rollin' until the ending. Oh, and the hot chick gets naked.",2007
9,"This by far is the best video game adaptation movie I have ever seen. It stayed mostly true to the games but instead the agents were orphans instead of clones. There were many great action scenes and nods to the games, such as Agent 47 stealing various outfits, his weapons and his odd ways of killing his targets. the movie reminded me of an all new game in itself.",2007
8,"I've played Hit-man and have really been excited to see the movie. At first I was wondering how will they ever pull off the Hit-man movie but after watching it, its one of the few games to movie adaptations that I really liked. Not a perfect adaptation, but the best so far compared to others out there. Though Jason Statham was my initial bet, Timothy Olyphant did a good job with portraying Agent 47.",2007
7,"First, I've heard mostly mixed comments about this movie. But, I'm glad that for the first time in a long time, an ""action"" movie has had an in-depth plot. Not to mention, they captured the personality of 47 near perfectly. When I went to see this, I didn't think I would like it because Timothy Olyphant played such a convincing geek in Die Hard 4, but he did an incredible job of changing roles. The basis behind the movie is that the hit-man is sent to assassinate someone, but it goes bad, which results in him picking up Olga Kurylenko. Now, they tried to add some jokes in, and he does do some things that are completely out of character (such as smiling), but for the most part, he plays the part very well. Now, the hit-man games aren't known for the best plot of all time, but, since the movie focused more on plot then on actual action, it feels a bit refreshing since the games are basically ""Target, Money, Kill"". I'd like to see the next Hit-man game focus more on the plot.",2007
1,"Hitmna is a poor adaption of its masterful game series. Action, stealth, a good story and well forged characters are all present and clear in the game. However when they had announced Hit-man would be making a debut on the big screen i felt a little concerned and worried about its quality that is shown in the games. The main one being, weather it would obtain its 18 certificate and weather its violence would be as great and graphic as it is in the games. I was sadly wrong on both accounts. The violence in the film is so inevitably poor and unfocused on how the game was, and the 18 certificate so many people had hoped for.",2008
3,"Alright, this movie might have 2 different ratings whether you're seeing this because you're a fan of the game or if you're a casual viewer of action movies.",2007
8,Viewers unfamiliar with the video game won't be disappointed - this is a well rounded action movie in its own right. Those who have played the video games from which the film characters are derived should enjoy the way Olyphant brings the anti-hero to life on the big screen.,2008
4,"A disturbing trend that seems to have no end in sight is the constant making of movies based upon video games. The fact of the matter is that these movies largely end up being horrendous misinterpretations of the source material. As evidenced by such cinematic horror shows like the Resident Evil movies, Street Fighter, Super Mario Brothers, Tomb Raider, and every movie by Uwe Boll. Of course there is the occasional movie that proves the maxim wrong, I for one enjoyed the Final Fantasy movie: The Spirits Within. Granted it had next to nothing to do with the game series apart from the name, but I was able to enjoy it. There was also the Silent Hill movie, that was great due to the fact that it was able to maintain a majority of the atmosphere from the games, and the plot was largely consistent with the mythos of the Silent Hill series. Unfortunately the latest movie to try to adapt a video game has largely failed to take even the smallest modicum of what made the games enjoyable.",2007
8,"As we are all well aware of most film adaptations of video games are usually very poor. This is not the case with Hit-man. Hit-man has done something that no other video game film has been able to pull off before. It is entertaining to the general audience who has not plaid the video game, by use of witty remarks, dark humor, and excellent action scenes. On the other hand fans of the video game series will be pleasantly surprised that Hollywood has not butchered the concept of the video games. There has been much debate over the actor who played 47; all actors did an excellent job. I was very pleased.",2007

The action scenes were okay, the plot was pathetic and somewhat fantastical, everything was preplanned so perfectly, oh i'll give them a key to the church in my briefcase because i definitely know that they'll find me, i'll kill the brother and they'll have the ceremony in that exact church, then i'll wait in the room and get arrested and make my escape... There's a man who thinks ahead. I heard that it was rubbish and what not so i was hopeful that it would be better than I thought but it wasn't...

8,"As Agent 47 played by Timothy Olyphant aims his gun at Interpol's Mike Whittier (Dougray Scott), he asks, ""How does a good man decide when to kill?"" That is the paradox of Director Xavier Gens's slick ""Hitman"". The screenplay by Skip Woods is based on the video game ""Hitman"". I am unfamiliar with the game. Movie genesis from video games usually does not bode well. However, ""Hitman"" surprises with narrative and visual style, and the charismatic Olyphant as Agent 47. Olyphant (recently seen in ""Live Free or Die Hard"") has a decidedly dark air about him, and wisely underplays the role. Also a surprise is Olga Kurylenko who plays Nika, the woman 47 must protect in the enveloping conspiracy. Kurylenko is stunning naked, and surprisingly she is a genuine and compelling actress. She embodies vulnerability and smarts in what could have been a one dimensional victim. Analogous to ""The Fugitive"" narrative pretext, director Gens expediently overlays the origins of the mysterious 47 as a youth bred and trained to become the perfect assassin in the opening credits. Is he really a ""good man""? ",2007
7,".. despite the fact that the longest period i have spent playing hit-man the game was 10 minutes , i really did enjoy this movie ",2007
9,"Well is it? Did we finally meet a franchise who will not die due to the fact Hollywood over did the already flawless title that is Hit-man? Well I most certainly hope so, because this movie delivered in spades. Hit-man is a classic action title which made me very comfortable and took me out of the game state of mind and more into the movie. During the movie I wasn't drawn into comparing the movie to the game, either you played the game or not, I think there is something here for all the die hard fans, and your high octane action movie buffs. Hit-man leaves the disappointing titles such like Resident Evil, Doom, Alone in the Dark and that dreadful film if you can even it a film House of the Dead with two rounds in their pathetic heads. I highly recommend this film, and with all the humor, action and keeping it to the pure true artistic style to the game, you will not be disappointed.",2007
3,"Being a longtime fan of the games, I was pretty excited to hear that they were planning on making a film based on them. I knew that it would be a challenge to depict a rather 1-dimensional character like 47 in an honest and objective manner, while still making it entertaining for the public. That was when my optimism about this project faded; knowing Hollywood would take the easy way out, converting the rather complex and serious games into a very predictable and regurgitated action flick.",2007
3,"You'd think Twentieth Century Fox would have shot the works on their cinematic adaptation of the popular video game ""Hitman."" Instead, these corporate clowns have succeeded only in shooting themselves in their feet with a flat, formulaic, standard-issue thriller that has neither a shred of suspense nor a sense of style. Initially, ""xXx"" star Vin Diesel had planned to star in this preposterous pabulum. In a last-minute casting shuffle, however, baby-faced Timothy Olyphant replaced the burly, blunt Diesel. Olyphant managed to menace Bruce Willis in ""Live Free or Die Hard,"" but he isn't as intimidating as Diesel. Basically, with his Lex Luther look, i.e., Olyphant is as bald as Diesel, but he is rarely as bold as Diesel. Olyphant shares the blame for ""Hitman"" with the fools who wrote and helmed what should have gone directly to video along with all the other cloned claptrap. ""Swordfish"" scribe Skip Woods contributes a slipshod screenplay that qualifies as a catalogue of clichés. The outlandish Clive Owen actioneer ""Shoot'em Up,"" about a deadly accurate hit-man protecting a woman and an orphan infant that illuminated screens a few months ago, emerges as a masterpiece compared to this cretinous, incomprehensible, comic book nonsense. Sophomore French director Xavier Gens doesn't provide enough larger-than-life set-pieces or eye-opening stunts to enliven things. Worse, the origins of our elite, enigmatic title character called Agent 47 are shrouded in secrecy, and Agent 47 is so invincible you know he will never acquire so much as a scratch, even in a room swarming with flying lead. The only thing remotely surprising is that our anti-heroic hero finds the time to keep his head clean-shaved so the bar code tattooed to the back of his noggin stands out for all to see.",2007
7,"Okay before we begin, let's take a look at the title of the film in question: Hit-man. Not only that, but the T is created by pressing two handguns together upside down. Okay, now we know what kind of film we're dealing with. Hit-man is a strange kind of film. It seemed to pop up around the end of the summer with it's teaser trailer and then stay below most people's radar, with the exception being fans of the game. Then in popped up again with a full blown trailer and then two weeks later it was released. This is the approach of a studio that doesn't exactly believe in it's product. However, Hit-man isn't actually all that bad. While not breaking or even bending the rules, the action is load, violent, and stylish. Some of the movies strongest moments are when the hit-man, Agent 47 (Olyphant) is doing his thing, staying one step ahead of the game before the action explodes onto the screen. The plot is a bit convoluted, but it was bound to be. 47 is hired to assassinate Mikhail Belicoff, a Russian politician running for reelection. His problems begin when the man he killed holds a press conference showing him to be simply grazed by the bullet. Judging by the ample amounts of blood used in the assassination scene, he didn't miss. From there 47 finds himself running for his life from Russian goons as well as people from his own organization. And along the way of course he find the hooker with a heart of gold, Nika (Olga Kurylenko). The plot is linear and not complicated. The film carried a serious, but not too serious, tone. Moments of levity surround 47 and his awkward sexual frustration; we see him reading articles about what women want, and he has some humorous back and forths with Nika. However, we all know that Nika's really purpose in this film is to wear a very revealing dress, and then take it off. In the end, Hit-man manages to be a decent action flick, perhaps even slightly above average. I disagree with most people and think that Olyphant did a fine job playing the hit-man. Would Vin Diesel have been a better choice? Maybe, but not necessarily; Olyphant's mild mannered disposition carries the tone of the film very well. So, will it win any Oscars... no. Will we ever be talking about the cinematic significance of Hit-man... no. Will I buy it on DVD... probably.",2007
1,"IMHO this movie is not even close to the idea presented in the games. Except the title and the fact that the main actor is bald, this movie has no similarities with the original concept. So, that mean that this is just a story about some assassin. Well, it is a very bad story. The main problem is of course script. Things happen in this movie without reason. The main characters move around a lot, but there is no solid explanation why. It's all based on the fact that everybody is after assassin and where he goes, everybody goes. There is no tension and the action is generally dull. The assassin ain't cool at all, he's just angry for some sort of a reason, which we of course don't know. Maybe, we even know, but we don't care.",2008
1,"As a fan of the games (meaning I've played them all to completion), this movie was a SERIOUS disappointment. In short, it seems like they wrote a completely generic action movie, then decided to shave the protagonist's head and call it ""Hitman"" as an afterthought. If you are a fan of the games, or even decent cinema, I recommend you avoid this at all costs. This movie was the first time I ever seriously considered getting up and leaving a theater. Towards the end of the movie, the disc skipped (in the theater) and no one seemed to notice or even care. To be honest, I remember thinking about how great it would be if it just skipped to the credits...",2008
1,I give this movie a 1 out of 10 for several reasons.,2007
1,"A truly unique example how it is possible to create a complete crap from having a great story. Every single scene in this movie has nothing to do with reality, from ""Russia"" filmed somewhere in Bulgaria to clothing and equipment of soldiers and officers. Director and editor work is terrible, but the guy who wrote the script should be probably executed several times. The behavior of main characters and the story itself is simply unbelievably unrealistic. Lord of the Rings movie is a serious documentary compared to Hit-man. ALL combat scenes are a terrible mix of action shots previously seen a hundred of times somewhere else. Not a single piece of unique atmosphere Hit-man game series used to have. And finally, if you guys call this acting, then I am William Shakespeare.",2008
8,"While doing some research before reviewing 1408, I was shocked to discover that this was the first time since 2004's Riding the Bullet that a film based on a Stephen King story had gotten the big screen treatment. 1408 marks somewhat of a comeback to the silver screen for the author after mainly working with television the past couple years. Director Mikael Hafstrom has created the most atmospheric and downright tense thriller I can think of so far this year. The premise may be thin, and yeah, it doesn't always make a lot of sense. But, is it ever effective.",2007
8,"I've never seen a horror film quite like 1408--can you even call this film a ""horror""? Well, it's not the horror movie we're used to seeing in this day and age. The films that are supposed to scare us nowadays are made from the same recycled junk we've been seeing for years now. Nonsensical plots are dreamed up just to make use of the exciting range of CGI. Underdeveloped characters we don't care about are tortured/murdered by a psycho for no apparent reason. Most of the intended audience for these movies isn't even scared anymore.",2007
8,"If your horror movie tastes run less towards chainsaw-wielding maniacs and more towards things-that-go-bump-in-the-night, then this is the movie for you. Based on a short story by the great Stephen King, ""1408"" is one of the genuine movie sleepers of summer 2007.",2007
8,"Just when you thought it was safe to check into a New York City hotel, along comes Mikael Hafstrom's chilling ""1408."" Not since Norman Bates terrorized guests at his motel has a paying customer received such treatment during a night's lodging. Although somewhat more cerebral than viscerally frightening, ""1408"" delivers its share of shocks and frights, and viewers will stay in their seats not to miss the film's twists and swerves. In a cruel blow to fans of 1970's soft rock, listening to the Carpenters' hit ""We've Only Just Begun"" afterward may stimulate nightmares and certainly will never be the same again.",2007

9,"Here's why. Stephen King's psychological horror rarely ever shows its face on the screen the way it appears in his writing. This movie captures a lot of the mental torture that Stephen King writes so well (embodied in room 1408). I typically always see Cusack as playing himself in every movie he's in. Fortunately, this role appeals to that character. I would say see it and judge for yourself. I specifically enjoyed the background music and director's choice of camera angles. I also appreciated the mix of surprise horror and psychological. All too often, a horror film loads up too much on one side and it just doesn't work out well!",2007
9,"A truly great horror film, with outstanding performances by both Samuel L. Jackson and Cusack. Well worth your money and time. If you are a Stephen King fan, then you will love this movie.

7,"It's a hit or miss thing with Stephen King movies. Sometimes there's an exceptional effort by someone with a really strong vision (eg Kubrick, De Palma), but then there are also some big blunders (Dreamcatcher comes first to mind). And then there are those that sort of lie right in the middle, as decent, unpretentious but unremarkable efforts that chill or spill into your living room or movie theater. 1408 isn't a great thriller, but for King fans it'll likely be one of the most faithful- or at least feel faithful- efforts to date, and as such it's pretty creepy and a sure-fire ""gotcha"" machine. The premise is vintage King: a cynical writer (Cusack) who's books go over the paranormal (with the exception of a personal book about a father and son), and gets sent an anonymous postcard about the Dolphin hotel and room 1408. The manager warns him, fervently, to not stay in the room. But he's insistent to the point where there's no turning back. Slowly, but extremely surely, things start popping up in the room, out of Elsin's own consciousness, perhaps, and as well with the environment changing (fix that heater!), and even a pint-sized version of the hotel manager (who doesn't want to see Jackon ala Indian in the Cupboard?).",2007
7,"The idea behind 1408 is actually kind of cute; a sort of 'what if' scenario based on what might happen if an inanimate object was given life. We've all seen Child's Play and perhaps the less than desired sequels but here, the inanimate object given life and then forced to fall into the horror genre is a motel room  a neat and effective idea. Following on from other such Stephen King adaptations, 1408 adopts the approach of putting someone in an individual location and then allowing events to unfold around them without ever letting them leave: it can be a prisoner in The Shawshank Redemption in a prison; a crippled author trapped in a lodge in Misery or a haunted motel room you cannot escape from as seen here.",2008
8,"The word ""horror"" has become increasingly twisted in modern cinema to be equated with paper thin excuses for characters being subjected to senseless violence and various cheap shocks intended to make the audience sporadically jump rather than actually be subjected to an all-consuming sense of overwhelming fear. With that in mind, it is refreshing to see a literary adaptation from Steven King, largely considered the godfather of the modern horror story, which resists falling prey to such trappings, and instead concentrates on generating more carefully thought out scares, preying on deep seated societal terrors. As such, director Mikael Håfström's 1408 proves a merciful throwback to the days of psychological horror thrillers, concentrating more on the mind than the bile duct, and a solid enough effort to help re-instigate the initial traits of the genre into the modern mainstream. ",2008
5,"Coulda been a contender, but just didn't take off. ""Boo"" thrillers like this should pick you up at the start and give you no time to think - just throw one shock at a time at you. This seemed almost static - every scare shot was telegraphed. Instatead of jumping out of my seat from surprise, I found myself thinking 'here comes another scare' and trying to guess what the scare would be. Even the twist at the end was clumsily edited - instead of grabbing you off kilter and making you jump, it was deliberately set up and held too long - multiple reaction shots from the two characters instead of scare - quick reax - black. leaving you breathing fast and your heart pounding. Quite a few careless and egregious continuity goofs also pulled me out of the movie repeatedly. ",2007

Now I want to read the Stephen King short story after watching both versions of this movie.I prefer the extended director's cut because the scene in the vent was longer and was explained better.",2007
6,"I was really looking forward to this film, as the short story it's based on is one of King's classics, almost lovecraftian in its otherworldliness. Started off brilliantly, obviously director Mikael Hafstrom has been paying attention to the slow burn, anticipatory nature of Japanese horror. Cusack playing the embittered, alcoholic sceptic was an inspired bit of casting, as he was ideal for the role, pulling off what is essentially a one-man show. Unfortunately, like most Hollywood produced horror, it burns itself out just after halfway through, as if it doesn't know where to go. The wall-hugging sequence (obvious nod to Cat's eye) was inspired and then.. Dream sequence? Oh it was all a dream, NO, and I'm back in the room. Sorry, tired and lame there, if Bobby had walked out of the shower at that point I couldn't have cared less. The ending, well, COULD have been done so much better, if Enslin had died in the fire, allowing his wife to find the dictaphone and play back that message it would have been a fantastic ending, but, typical Hollywood, not allowing the protagonist to die for fear of upsetting people (I mean really, what could upset a horror fan?) In the story Enslin immolates himself to escape, the film gives him his wife back and a walking stick. So I'll give this one six skulls, and shame on Dimension for not having the guts to go with a decent, gritty, ending.",2007
8,"This is what I look for in independent film. Well drawn characters, competent movie making, and a pleasing ambiguity that a big studio wouldn't dare leave in, lest the audience actually decide how to feel for themselves. The guys are great - desperate, sleazy, charming, funny and sad. The girls are also portrayed fairly - scheming, sweet, sexy and innocent. Leguizamo's character is believable to me as an aging playa, chafing against middle age and lusting for Waterson's Shirley. And Shirley is the best on-screen pimp in recent memory. To be fair: things unfold a little quickly, people accept their situations a little easier than they might in real life, but this is a pretty short movie, and throwing in more angst would be overkill and overlong on screen. No one comes away clean, and no one comes away as the absolute bad guy. Moral absolutes would kill this film, and I'm glad it got made the way it did.",2008

I though the story was hip with a dark undercurrent. A teenager turns madam after her babysitting service gets sexy. The sex was secondary to the plot. At the core it was a drama about the human condition of getting older. At one time you're in high school then you find yourself married with children looking back and wanting back those youthful days of freedom.

The film left me wondering how gritty this movie ended up being. I really enjoyed the transformation of Shirley into the boss of the girls in her ""club"".

I agree that it showed men as shallow and selfish, but the girls were profiting which I think made sense. I didn't find it a 10 because of the picture it painted and the disturbing ending.

4,I went into the theater with very few expectations except for one: This new Halloween movie was going to have great atmosphere and chills. I was confident it would be one scary movie and I was really looking forward to it.,2007
4,"This comment is for people who have already seen the movie. The way Michael Myers is able to break through the chains and kill four prison guards, and not get hurt at all is insanely unrealistic. Also regarding that scene, they would've had that whole killing on a hidden camera, and more guards would go to Myers and attempt to stop him. That part was where I really became upset with the film. Other unrealistic parts of the movie were when Dr. Loomis shoots Myers I believe three times and hits what seems like around the heart every time and Myers still gets up no less than two minutes later and continues to kill people with ease. Also on a couple occasions when people would have a gun pointed at Myers and not shoot and give him time to destroy them, that made me think, ""What the heck are they doing not shooting this maniac? They have a perfect shot every time yet they seem to freeze up."" And when the girl stabs Myers in the neck, or maybe it was the back, but if it was the neck there is no way he is surviving that, yet he was able to just pull the knife out of his neck, and continue trying to kill the girl. There are other parts that were really just not impressive and it made me highly disappointed with the quality of the film. It seemed to me that Rob Zombie and others who wrote and had a hand in directing and writing and producing the movie just wanted to make it as bloody as possible and just focus on the shock value, but there is more to a horror movie than just making the people in the audience throw up in their seats after being overwhelmed by gallons of blood spray throughout the silver screen. I wouldn't recommend it, you can spend your money in a more wise way on a better horror movie.",2007
3,"Rob Zombie has made a career of all things horror. From the musical group White Zombie to his own solo career, in comics with his monster fighting character El Superbeasto and into films. His first two forays, ""House of 1000 Corpses"" and ""The Devil's Rejects"" tied into one another nicely with the second film being a sequel to the first. But with his third film, ""Halloween"", Zombie falls short of offering not only scares but signs of a developmental director.",2007
2,"I like a lot of viewers had high hopes going into this movie. Usually I am a Rob Zombie fan, as he has made some good horror flicks in the past. This however was not one of them. I agree with a lot of folks that the back story on Mikey's upbringing made him seem human and not as scary as the original. The original Michael never uttered a sound except the disturbing breathing sounds uttered from his mask. This character talked for probably the first 30 minutes and actually was kind of funny when he was talking to Dr. Loomis. He seemed like a dorky kid who one day started slaughtering every person he encountered except his mother and baby brother? sister? I thought it was a boy until the plot developed further. When he grows up he is ridiculously huge and looks like a member of Slipknot. From here the movie really begins to derail badly. Shamelessly ripping off lines from the first movie, quick sex and even quicker violence is only half the problem with this movie. My personal favorite was the Ben Trammer reference from the first movie that was thrown in there for obvious comic effect. Where Rob Zombie really failed in this movie was how Laurie Strode was portrayed. In the original Jamie Lee Curtis was a sweet, naive girl who was scared to talk to boys and had an innocence about her. This incarnation of Laurie Strode is your typical high school slut,and ultimately we don't care if she lives or dies. My least favorite part of the movie was the darkness of it and the insane fight scenes between Mikey and Laurie. For like the last 30 minutes they are fighting in what seems like pitch black. I understand what Zombie was trying to do, but it was annoying. Because of this, the viewer really did not know what the hell was going on. Laurie was in the walls, the ceilings, the fence and the whole time Mikey was jabbing his knife or stick into these attempting to kill her. It was hard to even see what was going on. Then the movie has a false ending and then really ends. Who cares at this point? What a shame. My high point of the movie was seeing the lovely Danielle Harris topless for about ten minutes. All in all this movie was a waste. Poor story, bad coloring in the film, although nice topless scene with Danielle Harris. Preceed at your own risk.",2007
4,"If I had a cool fake last name and a semi-successful pseudo-metal band in the 90s, maybe I would be approached to direct a ""retelling"" of a horror classic to make a ton of money for the studio.",2007
3,"In the beginning we have a lazy-ass foul mouth (step-?) father nagging on everyone in the family. William Forsythe is a fine actor, but I think he really overacts on that one. Perhaps we are supposed to be disgusted of the father, but then I don't feel that we should need to feel sympathy towards Michael. Also the breakout of the ward was stupid. Guards are caught their pants down like idiots. And the ""blaming scene"" afterward is ridiculous. There are couple of another laughable scenes, like the girl in the end trying to get through the metal wire bed (which she actually manages) instead of simply going out of the house as the bad guy is blocked anyway. The movie has some incredibly dull and horrible dialog. And even charismatic Malcolm McDowell cannot save the day. I think that horror has been done so much better in numerous other forms that this movie is simply a redundant ""money collector"". To conclude my opinion, I was surprised and disappointed that was so little Rob Zombie on the soundtrack.",2007
3,"First of all, as a movie in general I though was less than average. As a remake, it was *beep* horrible. People will always say, ""Oh this is a different movie, not the original, don't compare."" It's a remake, how could you not *beep* compare First, I always had a problem with a back-story, Michael was pure evil without one. Michael was so evil because he had no reason to kill, he just did. He was pure evil in human form, there was no rhyme or reason for what he did. Okay, a back-story doesn't have to be terrible, but it answers nothing.",2007
3,Well... where should I start?,2007
1,"God Awful...don't bother! The original Halloween is such a classic and in my mind no need to be remade, however if your going to remake it, please make it a good one! I personally think Rob Zombie sucks when it comes to movies, not because there isn't gore and horror but just because he sucks at making the characters and story line believable.",2007
1,"Why must Hollywood continue to churn out these worthless remakes? I'll be honest and say I wanted to like this movie, but I went in with low expectations. But, really, has Rob Zombie ever actually seen Halloween? Michael Myers was a normal 6 year old boy from a normal family who, suddenly, for no reason at all, put on a halloween mask, grabbed a knife, and murdered his sister. Zombie's Michael is supposed to be 11, his mother is a stripper, his dad is AWOL, and everybody, EVERYBODY, cusses worse than a sailor. As a fan of Mr Zombies music, these plot elements don't seem very new or fresh. After 10 minutes or so, I knew this was going to be just like his first 2 movies, bloody, violent, and boring. The only thing he didn't ruin was the music, and I was surprised he didn't find some way slip a hooker and a f-bomb in there. And then there was the cast. The girl paying Lourie was too short,too young, and lets be honest, too annoying. By the end, I just wanted her to shut up and go away. When I heard who was playing Dr Loomis, I was relieved. But he totally phoned it in on this one. All in all, this is Mr Zombies worst effort yet.",2007
3,"A few things should be noted before you read this review. I'm not a fan of Zombie as a director. All of his films have been sub par for me, and the only reason I saw this was because I'm having a bit of a gore fest and I heard that this version of Halloween did in fact have some blood in it.",2007
4,"And so it goes that Rob Zombie, great horror mastermind and irrelevant metal vocalist, takes on one of my personal favorites in the Hollywood horror genre and promptly reduces it to the value of a single piece of dog feces.",2007
2,"I wanted to like this movie. I really did. I went in with an open mind. After all, it is not easy to remake a classic. Especially when the original Halloween was perfect. Nonetheless, this movie is a major disappointment. It starts off well enough, and I did enough the background of Michael. However, when it gets to present day, the story line skips through sections and you get the feeling of bad editing. Plus, all the jumping around leads to no character development and a group of teenagers we could care less about. To put in plainly, there is no suspense in this movie. Even though Zombie adds his own touch and scenarios to the story line, he never gives the audience a feeling of dread. Unlike the original, there are no moments of, ""run'"" ""look out behind you"" and all the edge of your seat stuff. It's just cut to scene, kids are killed, cut to next scene.",2007
1,"Let me start by saying that the original ""Halloween"" is by far my favorite horror flick ever. I have the original movie poster from 1978 framed and hanging in my basement. I'll also admit, I have the Michael Myers doll that plays the music. Huge fan. So, when I heard RZ was remaking this, I was a little peeved. Then I started to see some of the previews, and actually became excited about it. So, I DID go in with an open mind. The best way to sum this up, is that RZ COMPLETELY missed the point of what made Michael so scary in the first place. The fact that there WAS no reason, no conscience, no sense of ANYTHING. He was, and I quote, ""purely and simply evil."" He IS, in essence, the ""boogyman"". Trying to shove down my throat the fact that he became like that because his family was white trash is NOT scary. If I wanted to watch Jerry Springer, I would have stayed home. RZ if you read this, you need to realize that gore does not mean scary. It was not necessary in the 1978 original, yet that remains some 30 YEARS LATER the GREATEST horror movie of all time. What does that tell you????",2007
1,The first half an hour is almost unwatchable. Two people in the theater left and never came back. I have never felt the urge to leave a theater mid-movie but for some reason (my $5.00 or perhaps sheer boredom)I decided to stick it out.,2007
1,"I think Rob Zombie is a talented film maker. I thought his first two efforts were perfect homages to the genre he professes to love. He subtly tipped his cap to the pinnacles of the genre and yet still managed to show us his own style. When I heard he was taking on Halloween, it made me nervous. Halloween is the best of the bunch. With all due respect to Psycho, which Halloween tried to emulate, Halloween is just so much better than any other horror film ever produced. I realize this is not an empirical statement, but the quality of Halloween and the influence it has over a plethora of horror films is. There is simply no getting around it, Halloween is the best of the best. I say this because for Zombie to want to remake the pinnacle of horror takes a lot of balls and it had better of been a faithful retelling of the story or it won't work. ",2007
2,"I had heard nothing but positive reviews from friends and family when I decided to check Zombie's version of Halloween out for myself. So you could say I was looking forward a nonstop thrill-ride of some sort. To say it simply, I couldn't count the numerous times I yawned through-out this terrible movie. Rob Zombie had made it clear to his audience, to see this for a movie itself, don't try to compare it to the original. But what you don't understand is that when you're remaking the classic best horror movie of all time, it is impossible to just forget the original completely, especially when several scenes came STRAIGHT from the original.",2007
1,"WTF WAS THAT!!! One Question Zombie did you watch the original, because you got it all wrong. You're not as famous and the original Halloween, so to take it and screw it like you did totally suck. You have just destroyed a classic. Anyone who gave this movie more that one full star is not a real Horror fans. Zombie's Michael Myers is a Fag, white trash boy looking for some attention. John Carpenter's Michael Myers lived in the suburbs; parents loved him, but he was taken over by evil ""pure evil"" the devil, he killed because of the rage in him.",2007

2,"OK, now my problem with Halloween(2007) is this is a film that DID NOT need to be remade. Halloween('70's) was absolutely perfect in every aspect, in my opinion, it's the scariest movie of all time. But when I heard that Rob Zombie was on to direct this movie, I actually thought for a minute there was a possibility this may be a good remake. I saw it this morning at the theater, I am in absolute disgust. Just it's not like he just re-made the movie into his own idea, no, he took some of John Carpenter's excellent ideas and just made them into crap. Now I'm separating this from the original, Halloween(2007) was actually by itself a bad film. Which really disappointed me since The Devil's Rejects was done so well, this was just a typical stupid unoriginal slasher movie. Now, Rob had a good idea where he developed Michael's character in the beginning, where we had a better idea on why he became Michael Myers. But after that, everything went downhill, because Rob just rushed all the other IMPORTANT characters, so they got no development what-so-ever.",2007
2,"I was always sceptical about this movie being a huge fan of the JC original which has remained my number 2 favourite movie of all time for the past 15 years or so - and boy was I right to be! Rob Zombie, who I personally feel has directed two great horror movies with 1000 corpses and Devils Rejects, has completely and utterly ruined a classic movie! Yes I know he was never ""remaking"" the original and he was always planning on ""re-telling"" the story from a different perspective - but seriously Mr Zombie, why bother? All you have done is taken great characters and a great story and just made it into a useless, pointless piece of twaddle which should be locked away in movie hell forever! I think spending 55 minutes of movie time building up a character we already know was just stupid, I think making the likable main girl from the original into a foul mouthed, sex obsessed plank was just a waste of time and I think all of the random killings were just plain unnecessary! I award you 1 star Mr Zombie for this terrible movie and that is just because I liked that bit at the beginning where you froze young Michael Myers running away from school and played the classic Halloween theme tune - if you hadn't put that bit in you would get 0 stars! Rubbish!",2007
2,"With its precise direction, slick cinematography, talented and likable cast, and excellent use of a particularly menacing score, John Carpenter's Halloween was a highly polished exercise in perfection. In contrast, Rob Zombie's 'reimagining' of the Michael Myers mythos is an ill-considered mess, delivering the director's grungy 'white trash' aesthetic, an incongruous soundtrack of rock classics, lots of gore and nudity, a raft of characters one couldn't give a damn about, and very little in the way of originality.",2007
1,"When I first heard that Rob Zombie was remaking the original Halloween I was more surprised then anything. I didn't know too much about Rob Zombie, but I did think that remaking the film wasn't the best choice. my thought was that if they did want to remake it then first they should do a FINAL Halloween sequel to finish off the Halloween series and finally give it an end, then film a remake for October 2008 (the 30th anniversary) but instead we get a rushed written script, rushed filming and production and a back story to a once terrifying character that proved to be overdone and drawn out. I could not believe how poor the dialog was, it was if the director believed that use of poor language was necessary in making a successful movie. the movie opens in a such a way that anyone who has seen the original will say that it does not fit the story. Michael's family is just pure white trash, what's the point of that. all the death scenes contained way too much gore, and every girl that was killed, had to be done while having sex and nude. a lot of the characters that we're killed, had no point to be killed. the second half of the film was completely rushed we didn't get to see much of the other characters. Scout-Taylor Compton is a gifted actress, but the script gave her no acceptable lines or enough screen time. the placement of carpenter's music does not fit at all. being the fan of Halloween that i am, i could not wait for the movie to be over. if a sequel is made to this movie i only hope that rob zombie is not asked to write or direct it. this movie makes Halloween resurrection look like a masterpiece, that should explain it all.",2007
1,"This was one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time.It was worse then the House of Wax re-make and that was utter crap.It's bad enough that Zombies last two movies were pieces of trash.Too much cussing for one,then the plot was weaker then the original.Michaels mother being a stripper was stupid,should not have been in the film.Then with her killing herself later,moronic plot line,Michael talking was the worst part of it all.No part of the movie was worth talking about,not even the cameos of all the has been horror movie actors.If I could give this movie less then a 1 I would.The acting was immature and funnier then scary,like it was supposed to be.Its bad enough that Hollywood has lost it with all the re-makes of sorry horror movies,but when they start with actually GOOD horror and make this kind of crap.The movie studios should fire their creative teams and hire fresh blood.Even with all the blood and gore in this lousy film,I almost walked out a few times,first time in my history of loving movies.",2007

Karen Crowder (Swinton) ends up paying a high price to play hard ball with the big boys, while the late Arthur Eden disappears in a whirlwind of raving madness and moral sense. I'll eat my hat if this part doesn't get Tom Wilkinson his second nomination for best actor. But then, the part of the madman has been everyone's favorite since the dawn of drama. Thanks to his impeccable box office pedigree as the man behind the ""Bourne"" trilogy, the producers let writer-director Tony Gilroy get away with a far from mainstream script. He takes inspiration from tales of John Doe glory like ""The Pelican Brief"" and ""Payback"" for plot, and from late nineties gems like ""The Game"" and ""A Perfect Murder"" for style and atmosphere, creating a quiet yet suspenseful tale of a weary warrior's tenacity.

2,"I was eagerly awaiting the release of this movie only to be dropped flat. Excellent actors, lousy parts. I didn't get attached to anyone in the movie, except for George Clooney's son, who was more of a plot device prop, than a character. There are extra, pretty useless characters, like the drunk brother that waste the viewers time and don't really pay off in the end. The same set up could have existed without the extra family. I'll allow one coincidence to every screenwriter, but this movie is chock full of them. Clooney just happens to have a brother on the police force. He just happens to run into the lunatic lawyer who's hiding from everybody. He just happens to pull over to look at horses when his car blows up. And so on. We have to see this stupid scene not once, but twice. Why does he stop to look at the horses for crying out loud? The first time I see it I think surely its a set up that will pay off later. But no. Not to mention, the writer would have been wise to sit up for an all night marathon of CSI to think we would buy that his throwing a watch, wallet and cell phone in a burning car would equate to somebody thinking he was dead. Hello? the most basic forensically challenged would realize these items would burn up. Yet the absences of a corpse, well, that wouldn't throw anyone off. And the killing of the lunatic lawyer, well, gee, an ""apparent suicide"" for overdose would include an examination of his stomach contents, which, surprise, would not have included all those pills since his killers injected him with the drugs that kill him. Somewhere in all the hacked, arty story telling there was a half way decent plot that got wasted on this dreary, boring, annoying product. I was so far ahead of everyone in it, I wanted to just stand up and announce what was going to happen so we could all go home. Everybody in the theater groaned at the end. Maybe a few simple people that are in love with George Clooney will enjoy it, but I'd rather watch repeated reruns of ER.",2007

Horses, in an indirect way, will save his life and well, you can sit through this couple of hours without guessing what's going to happen next and, if you permit me, without caring. I prefer George Clooney in his brighter, campier roles. I believe Cary Grant had the same problem but I would like to know who's idea was the Queen Christina moment through the closing credits.

Sure they told us Clooney's character was a father and sort of had problems, but so what? Didn't make me care any more then when I started. The guy is supposed to be a brilliant ""cleaner"", but continues blindly through the movie. The bad guys can efficiently ""remove"" one problem, but when it comes to Clooney's character, they use the ""let's find the most inane, sophomoric solution we can find"" solution.

I've always been a huge Anderson fan and adore all four of his previous efforts, and this certainly ranks among his best (top three, easily).

While his other features have been more minimalistic and set between a certain group of characters, Darjeeling takes on a much larger world.",2007
5,"Well, on paper, an interesting concept, and a solid, reliable cast was brought together. Nothing wrong with the locations. But what in the world happened during the filming of this movie? It is an example of one of the worst-case scenarios of best-laid plans gone terribly wrong. Oh, well, even the best ideas sometimes suffer from poor execution. The plot was thin, basically non-existent, and the acting was surprisingly flat. The directing was mediocre at best. The editing was choppy, and the acting may have suffered from poor directing and the near absence of plot, and an uninspired screenplay. There was not one funny scene. Not even one scene worth watching, with the possible exception of the ""surprise"" appearance of Bill Murray missing the train. But that was at the very beginning, and everything else went nowhere or downhill from there. A remarkably disappointing film.",2009
7,"The Darjeeling Limited is unlike the average comedy. While not being truly laugh out loud funny, the film is clever, well written, with memorable characters and one liners that grow wittier over time. The only type of movie it can be compared to are other films by Wes Anderson, the director of Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, and the love it or hate film, The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou. All of his movies are extremely stylized, with slow motion sequences, wide lenses that slightly distort the frame, and privileged, depressed characters with family issues all thrown together in a slightly artificial, timeless, carefully detailed environment. While with The Life Aquatic he may have tried to do too much, The Darjeeling Limited shows Anderson finally perfected his style. He knows when to throw inside jokes to his most loyal of fans, while keeping his stories fresh and personal, without acknowledging the critics who blame Anderson for repeating himself.",2007
9,This is such a DAMN GOOD MOVIE. ,2007
2,"This movie is really a stinker. Everything is good about it except the characters and the writing. It has high production values, the acting is very good, but the characters are shallow, narcissistic and nothing more than sum of their hangups. It's like some teenage film school freshman was given unlimited resources to try to create the most quirky characters ever, without a story to hang it on. Perhaps it's how a spoiled, rich teenager would imagine adults to be, selfish, whiny, demanding and spiritually hollow. ",2008
9,"Owen Wilson, Adrien Brody, Jason Schwartzmann as three brothers who haven't spoken for years, on a train. In India. By Wes Anderson.",2008
1,"After their very wealthy father of the Whitman family dies three very wealthy brothers set off to India to find their wealthy self-indulgent mother who is undergoing some mental catharsis guilt trip by acting as a nun in a Quasi Christian temple in India. On this journey through India, these three brothers attempt to also attain some spirituality by undergoing ridiculous made up spiritual rituals. The film actually begins with this meaningless episode of Jack Whitman, played by Jason Schwartzman, staying in an upmarket French hotel and having a reunion with his girlfriend played by Natalie Portman. There is a very gratuitous naked scene of Natalie Portman (More for the benefit of the Coppola family she obliges) and that just about ends her contribution to the film except for two seconds at the end. Bill Murray and Angelica Huston also make cameo appearances. The contrast between the three brothers and the absolute poverty of India is brushed over by some stupid interaction in the saving of a child's life and the funeral of one that tragically dies. There is a simplistic attempt at symbolism in the act of unloading luggage.",2008
10,"If you watch it carefully from the beginning with no preconception or bias the movie has immense subliminal humour and relaxation effect. It puts you in a pleasant stoned-like state if you watch it on a Friday after a hearty dinner:) Of all the movies I've seen this one doest it for me. You feel like buying a ticket - and going on a trip of your own. I do not like most of the actors but they have natural humour and played so brilliantly that I forgot the gripe. The movie does not force a sense of anything - you listen to the sounds of nature, the rural and the industrial landscape. The soundtrack is perfect. The 3 main characters are not successful or content with their lives yet they are forced to go on a ""spiritual"" journey because they once agreed to it (brothers). I imagine it is hard to market a situational comedy these days a la Wes Anderson, Cohen brothers, Jim Jarmusch with so many fast-paced bubblegum-plot flicks spewed by the industry. This plot would sound stupid if I hadn't known a family that did the same back when I was a kid.",2010
2,"If you have ever traveled India as a Westerner, considering yourself to be aware of cultural ignorance and stigmata and have discovered that world full of variations, full of true spiritually in every aspect of life (living, death, beauty, ugliness, dirt, colors, poverty and richness), this film will touch you in the most embarrassing way.",2008

But was i wrong! wow ... for a start.. the 3 main leads .. who i have liked on screen in the past..were given dreary dialogue .. The characters were all so unlikable, the story.. what story?!.. it just wasn't worth being made.. it told nothing. they had to stick a stupid funeral scene in for some visual effects OK i might be a little harsh .. it was well shot.. but thats all its got going for it.",2007
1,"We were so excited to see this movie--we loved the Royal Tenenbaums, we love & travel to India often, we love all the actors BUT we could barely get through it. It was boring, pointless, not funny and was almost insulting in it's completely false representation of Indian trains and the people who work on them. You would NEVER EVER find a women waiting on men on a train, wearing a short revealing dress. I'll never say never, but I doubt that even a prostitute would have sex with some white guy on an Indian train. Maybe it was supposed to be a cartoon with all the garish painted interiors and bogus events (a train getting lost?). I could have tolerated that if there was just anything to hang on to in the story. It was the worst movie I've seen in many years! Worse than Ishtar!",2008
2,"I have enjoyed Anderson's earlier efforts. Bottle Rocket (very funny), Rushmore (a sheer delight), Royal Tenembaums (not bad) and Life Aquatic (good fun). However, i found this to be largely crass, pointless and amazingly obvious. This is the kind of film that annoying young whipper snappers who wear skinny jeans, brandish ipods and have free access to their parent's bank accounts, who happen to feel the need to go to Thailand or India in order to discover themselves in the most clichéd possible way, will enjoy.",2008
1,"In this smug and never-funny comedy-drama a worthless trio of brothers try to find common ground on a train trip through India seeking out their mother. (Mom went to India and failed to attend their father's funeral in New york, the pretense of the movie.) All three brothers are obviously billionaire losers with no apparent earning skills or character values. Their wasting of money reflects the values of the coke sniffing Limousine Liberals who pollute the film industry these days; and this film is Exhibit A as to why we ought not shell out $10 for movies to support the lavish lifestyles of talentless actors like these three.",2008
2,"I went to The Darjeeling Limited with reasonably high expectations having enjoyed Anderson's earlier films and given that my family were originally from Gujerat (not far from the film's locations in Rajasthan). However, I found it to be largely crass, laboured and insensitive. It's the kind of film that Americans who have never been to India might enjoy, but for anyone who loves and knows the country it's quite another matter.",2007
5,"99.9% of the time I do not like to comment about films I have seen that I do not like; however, this weird film is the exception that proves the proverbial rule. Dargeeling was not so much a bad film, meaning the production qualities were poor, as a film that should just have missed being given financial backing.",2008
9,"I admit that arrogance is in the atmosphere of all of Wes Anderson's films and his style will probably never change, but I LOVE every single one of them (even the overblown ""The Life Aquatic"" gets me giddy). He knows how to push my emotional buttons and entertain the hell out of me, something that I find rare in most movies I watch. Usually if I want to be entertained, I feel the movie has to compromise the emotional value and vice versa. With Wes, I'm laughing, being entertained by the characters AND caring for them. The second that Adrien Brody ran past Bill Murray in slow motion running toward the train as The Kinks' ""This Time Tomorrow"" kicked in, my heart started racing at the idea that I was about to watch a new film by Wes, which I look at as something special that comes every few years. Wes' detractors complain that he is a pretentious one-trick pony, a true statement, but to me, not a negative one because I love his universe and I love being invited into it in every one of his films. While I love both of them, I occasionally wish that Tim Burton would make a film that wasn't some kind of Gothic fairy tale, or that Paul Thomas Anderson would make a film that didn't star his own ego. With Wes, I want him to just continue what he's been doing: keep using his same awesome style while taking baby steps of progress. The writing, acting, directing, soundtrack, production design and cinematography (okay, EVERYTHING) are top-notch in ""The Darjeeling Limited"". Hell, if ""Rushmore"" wasn't such a damn masterpiece, I'd say Wes has made his best film yet.",2007
9,"The first thing to note about Wes Anderson's new film (featuring Owen Wilson, Jason Schwartzman, and Adrien Brody, as the Whitman brothers, Francis, Jack, and Peter respectively) is that it was shot in India, mostly on a colorful old train traveling across Rajasthan. The train perhaps replaces the elaborate constructed set of the ship Anderson used in 'The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou.' That ship was a bit of an albatross. The movie cost $60 million to make and is Anderson's least admired work. The train is part of a faster and cheaper production and it's crucially different: it's a real train, in motion during the shoot. It's still perhaps an arbitrary and whimsical setand has the kind of bright pastel colors Anderson likesbut this time, as Brody has said about the shoot, they were learning to ""live in the moment,"" just letting things happen, and using whatever they observed of Indian life as elements in the film. Every time they turned around there was something unfamiliar, remarkable and new to see; if they could, they worked it in. This isn't navel-gazing (though there's that) but also discovery and wonderment. It's partly a homage to Anderson's fascination with India and admiration for Jean Renoir's 'The River' and the films of Satyajit Ray. The soundtrack isn't just sweet Seventies rock but music from Ray's classics.",2007
1,My wife and I watched this movie last week. We are both in our 30's and love every type of movie. What was the point of this movie? My wife fell asleep twenty minutes before the end. She never laughed once. I remember chuckling when they swapped medicine on the train. Other than that giggle it was boring. I kept watching and waiting but nothing ever happened.,2008
5,"Robin Williams is certainly a very gifted comedian. It would be a sin to classify him as untalented. But somebody needs to send this guy some decent scripts. I think the problem is people feel that all you need to do is cast Robin as the lead, and viola! You've got yourself a hilarious comic romp! Weak writing is weak writing. End of story. The film is not without laughs. I certainly did laugh several times, but as you would expect, most of the good jokes are given away in the trailer. Altogether, ""License to Wed"" is a predictable romantic comedy filled with lots of sitcom-level humor. It's worth checking out on cable. Like I said, there are some laughs, and watching the gorgeous Mandy Moore certainly doesn't hurt either. But this is one of those comedies you'll probably forget soon after you've seen it.",2007
6,"My friend and I were so excited to see this movie when we saw the trailer to License to Wed, it looked like a fun comedy. But when we heard all the bad reviews, we were a bit hesitant, but we figured that we still wanted to see it and why not? I don't get all the horrible reviews on IMDb, yeah, there were a few things wrong with the movie, but it seemed like nobody really wanted to enjoy this film. I'm not saying this to offend anyone, I just don't get how you could not laugh at least once in this film when it was just a cute romantic comedy that's better than most.",2007

2,"I'm going to say something that no one in License to Wed has the guts (or the brains) to say - Reverend Frank belongs behind bars. Frank is supposed to be a goofy and likable guy who grows on us despite his unorthodox methods toward couples coaching. Unfortunately, the movie goes to such extremes that we are not so much charmed by Frank, rather we are terrified by him. The man is a menace, and the fact that nobody seems to realize it except for one character makes everyone in this movie come across as completely oblivious.",2007
1,"This movie was just plain bad. But since I'm bothering to write this, I should go into more detail than that, right? This movie was tacky and offensive, all the more tragic because of the hilarity potential of Robin Williams and the likability potential of Mandy Moore and Jon Krasinski. Synopsis: Two cuties get together. (Aw, sweet.) Then comes the messed up marital counselling of Moore's bizarro pastor, played by Robin Williams. Williams, in all his ridiculous antics, is aided and abetted by a creepy little kid (sorry, no offense meant to the child actor playing the kid -- I'm sure the creepiness was all in the role) who tries to be cutely precocious, but basically comes off as an annoying, know-it-all, creepy, snot-nosed little brat. I only watched half an hour into the movie because it was so cringe-inducing, distasteful, unfunny and insulting to relationships. I walked out and caught the last half of The Brave One.

Mandy Moore did great and looked it..the groom to be did awesome as well...and Robin Williams as always made me laugh very hard. My audience all loved the movie when the obviously funny parts came along and even some of the jokes you had to be on your feet to catch ""Be chill don't kill, yes even you O.J."" so overall the love story was fantastic and the comedy aspect of it was hilarious as well.

I do love the comedy in this film, Robin Williams really does make this movie! I like how the script was written, it was comedic, romantic, and very sweet, it had moments of true heart, that was very refreshing to see. The characters in this movie do have good chemistry. No it's not the most original in the history of movies, but yes it is funny and kinda amusing. I'm not sure what the deal was with people from the office being in this movie, but like so many actors on the office appeared in here.

The characters were fun and relate-able and the plot was refreshing from all the super hero movies and all the sappy dramas that have come out this summer. John Krasinski did a great job being a character different from Jim Halpert(The Office). Mandy Moore's character stress with the wedding plans, building her flower business, and trying to succeed in seemingly pointless tasks. Robin Williams broke his curse of failing comedies with this movie, I genuinely laughed whenever his character made a joke (And trust me it takes a lot to make me laugh so hard that i might cry). All in all this was a great, funny, and light hearted movie that is too predictable or too sappy. I say go see it with a group of friend, family, or a loved one, sit back, relax, and enjoy! I give License to Wed a 9 out of 10.",2007
1,"A very common mistake between the producers from Hollywood is to think that a comedian who has been funny in the past,will always be funny in any circumstance.Robin Williams and his long list of crappy ''comedies'' are one of the most clear examples of that attitude.Williams is a good comedian and a magnificent actor but,when there is not a good screenplay,the movie will not be good.Williams needs a solid screenplay which has to work as a base of his personality.Good Morning Vietnam is the best example of what I just mentioned:on that movie,there was a brilliant screenplay and a good director who knew to mold the story to adapt to Williams' frenetic style.But,that was twenty years ago and,during the two following decades,we have seen this actor on a lot of comedies which seem to say:''It does not care if the script is bad...We have Robin Williams!''.License to Wed is one of that films and the worst movie in Williams' career(and I'm counting craps like Mrs.Doubtfire).License to Wed is so pathetic which cannot be called a movie...I would call it as a thing from the dust-bin.If you wanna see the jokes from this movie,go to Youtube(you will not laugh because all the jokes are crappy and worn-out)or,if you have insomnia problems,go to see this movie.The jokes from this movie do not have any grace and they have been seen on a lot of films.John Krasinki and Mandy Moore bring bad performances,while Williams' performance is really irritating.But,I do not wanna attack Williams.He did some wonderful performances on serious films(like in One Hour Photo or Good Will Hunting).The principal guilty is ''director'' Ken Kwapis(if what he did can be called directing a film)who did not know how to take advantage from Williams' enormous talent.License to Wed is,for the moment,the worst film of 2007 and one of the worst films from last years.This excrement called License to Wed should be destroyed.",2007

10,"Before I get into the film let me briefly surmise the actual case that this film is based on. Firstly, the actual case of Sylvia Likens was in reality much more brutal than this movie portrays. If you can try for a moment to wrap your mind around that fact than you can begin to fathom the unbelievable torture that this young woman actually endured. The actual case took place in the 1960s but for some odd reason this story is set in the 1950s this is where the confusion begins. Also, in the actual case, Sylvia was not raped nor was she forced to suffer the final indignity that the character in this movie does. That aside, this is a shockingly brutal and powerful film...yes the acting is stiff but I do believe that this was intentional in order to reflect the times. This film is a period piece and should be taken as such. When you take a look at the cast and realize the caliber of actors/actresses in this film anyone can easily see that these are not bad actors. Much of the brutality in this film is implied violence rather than in your face blood and guts. There are cut-aways during some of the more intense moments of the torture scenes but in many ways this makes things even worse! In this sense, this is genius film making. It makes the viewer believe that they have seen something much more horrific than they actually have, not to say that this makes the images seen in this film any less disturbing. A friend of mine who watched this film with me told me that he was unable to sleep for the rest of the night because of this film...and we're talking about a grown man in his late thirties! That's the sort of impact a film like this has. I am looking forward to ""An American Crime"" which is based on the court transcripts of the actual case and should adhere more to the facts but nonetheless ""The Girl Next Door"" is a film that punches you in the gut and refuses to relinquish it's grip on your senses.",2007

I have never before seen children ages probably ranging between 8-13 commit the inhumane acts as seen in this movie. The boy children were given permission by their sick twisted foster mother to torture a beautiful innocent girl. As the torture worsen you feel more and more sympathy for the girl; this is what makes the movie excellent because it captures the audience in a very powerful way. To make this movie even more horrifying is realizing the movie is based on a true story. I would not recommend anyone to watch this movie before they go to bed because it will be hard to sleep having to think about the poor girl being tortured.

Deciding to change lines, I quickly scrambled up the escalators at South Kensington, switching to the Circle and District Lines that could take me to Embankment, from where it was only a quick sprint up the Northern Line to the Leicester Square tube station- a mere stone's throw away from my final Fright Fest destination. As I hurriedly took my seat in a darkened auditorium, I wiped the sweat from my brow and settled down to the narration of David, a 50+ man remembering a painful past. I had made it, but only just.

10,"Directed by Gregory Wilson, and shot and produced by William Miller, Jack Ketchum's The Girl Next Door is a movie that few who've seen it will ever forget. Black-hole dark and beyond harrowing, it's nonetheless a carefully crafted work and also extraordinarily sensitive. In fact, if it's not strictly a horror film, then one can only conclude that it's the genre's loss. Jack Ketchum's novel, like much of his work, is based on compelling real-life events. In this instance the story draws upon a 1960s case of almost unspeakable child abusemost of that abuse committed by other children under adult supervision. Ketchum, who is extremely proud of this film adaptation, speaks openly about production company Moderncine's initial pitch to him: ""Let us make this movie before Hollywood does and ruins it."" To bring The Girl Next Door to the screen, Moderncine enlisted some topnotch talent, including award-winning director Gregory Wilson, who here displays a tremendous talent working with actors, and veteran writers Philip Nutman and Daniel Farrands. Still, in a period when horror movies have repeatedly pushed, and even mangled, the envelope, this one derives most of its emotional shock not from graphic content but from the realistic and courageous presentation of a long-standing cultural taboo: on-screen violence to children. Unfortunately, it's all too easy for mainstream critics to shoot down this kind of movie by terming it ""exploitative"" when actually it's the opposite: a tragedy that immerses the audience in the misery of the real rather than promoting escapism with comfortable, and clichéd, lessons about violence and evil. After a successful theatrical run in New York early in the fall, The Girl Next Door is now available here on DVD. I urge you to see it. Like another powerful film released in 2007, Bug, it may hit too close to home to appeal to the typical horror fan. Indeed, it has a slightly different audience in mind: human beings.",2007
10,This movie disturbed me to my very core. The acting is superb. The plot is very engrossing. Everything about this movie screams unbelievably well done and the makers of it should be extremely proud. This is the first Horror / Thriller were I actually felt for the characters. This is certainly the best film in its genera. This is also the reason why I wouldn't recommend watching it to most people... Watching this gives you a feeling as if you just accidentally killed your pet (worse actually)... It is far more horrifying then anything I have ever seen and the script makes it come to life which makes it even more terrifying....,2007
6,"I was very unsure on how to rate this film. I watched it all and to be fair the film held my interest throughout. I would say it is probably a good film but something I cannot say I enjoyed watching, which was probably the aim of the director. Taboo subjects in society change rapidly over the years and this film deals with argumentibly the most taboo, certainly a topic most people find hard to talk about. Abuse and torture happen. Fact. What this film managed to do for me is to take both subjects and ram them down my throat at a more than uncomfortable rate. And that is the story line. No humour. No romance as such and no happiness. For me this was not entertainment. I guess some people will enjoy this film, in the same way that people like to rubber neck at accidents when they drive past. The publicity will make this film popular and it will no doubt develop a form of notoriety that clockwork orange and the exorcist enjoyed twenty years ago. But for me. I will not be watching it again as I would not be able to get anything positive out of it.",2007
8,"Wow, even some of the reviewers of this movie seem to be at a complete loss of words when they try to describe the picture. They barely understand why it is so frightening, why they can't sleep afterwards or what it is that chills them to the bone. I can offer an explanation: this film depicts acts made of pure evil, evil in its most disturbing form. Not committed by some entertaining movie-maniac like Freddy or Pinhead that cracks jokes while slaughtering folks, but by something that is a lot more frightening, more haunting and terrifying: an entirely normal human being. Other reviewers seem to miss a motive for the atrocities, a reason for the escalation, apart from Ruths obvious derangement and general frustration with life, and ask why the others (especially since they're still kids) join in so easily. They are actually looking for explanations. C'mon, people, wake up! It's the same thing that makes drunk daddy hit his five year old with an empty liquor bottle or beat mommy to a pulp right in front of the eyes of his terror-frozen offspring. Because he can, that's why. Because he's frustrated and in a position of absolute power, and power tends to corrupt, doesn't it? Now, combine this with barely suppressed unfocused anger and you have your motive. First comes frustration, then anger, then violence, then abuse. One might say it's the devils ladder, a downward spiral straight to hell. And when they get to the bottom, sick individuals like Ruth might even get some revolting kind of kick out of the fact they can use and abuse the weak to their liking. Just like a kid that tortures a frog or beats up a smaller co-ed, tapes it with a handy-cam and posts the clip on youtube to boast with his inhumanity. Plus, you never needed the devil to rape, mutilate or open up a KZ - a mere human will always suffice. So, to the rest of you: be warned, folks, if you're looking for cheap thrills, this is not the right movie for you. Neither is there anything in it one in his right mind could ""enjoy"", like, let's say, your average horror flick. Rather be prepared to be filled up with anger and sadness to the bottom of your very soul. I won't watch this a second time, but surely its art, though not the pleasant kind.",2008
10,"After just sitting through Jack Ketchums THE GIRL NEXT DOOR, I had mixed emotions, but mainly I felt extremely sad at what I had just watched. The film is a true story set in the 50's about a two young sisters who go to live with their aunt after losing both parents in a car accident. The younger sister got badly injured and has to walk with steel frames supporting her legs. But her older sister, Meg, takes care of her and in general is a really nice kid. But when they go to live with their aunt, things turn nasty, really nasty. The aunt is a really horrible person, she has all the local lads round her home all the time drinking beer and doing basically anything they please. But aunt really does call the tune, anything she says - goes! And as soon as she takes a dislike to Meg thats when the torture and downright cruelty begins. Now, I'm not going to go into any great detail, but what happens to Meg in this film is disturbing, but incredibly engrossing to watch.",2007
8,"Based on a true story, this is one sick and very very disturbing movie. A foster Mother has a couple of young Sisters join her foster family, and the boy next door becomes friendly with the oldest girl. The foster Mother is an unbelievable bitch, and for no reason gives the younger impaired with leg braces Sister a spanking with a long brush for nothing. But it's the older Sister that gets taken to the basement and strung up by her wrists as other kids begin to torment her, stripping her, torturing her, even raping her later, while the foster Mother encourages them on. And believe me, the worst was still to come for this girl. The boy next door tries his best to help her, but there's not much he can do, except never forget it for the rest of his life. I was glued to this movie, as was everybody else watching it, and when it was over, it was like wow, that was one disturbing movie. You'll probably hear about ""Girl Next Door"", especially being a true story, and I would suggest you check it out. The last fifteen minutes are pretty hard to watch. I saw the movie at a special preview at the Indianapolis Horror Hound Weekend convention.",2007

8,"I was presented with this movie on the Chiller station. I was expecting Freddy Kruger-like horror. This was not that type of movie and I am upset that it was on this station even though it is one of the most horrifying movies out there. And it's based on true facts. Throughout this movie my thoughts kept going to the book ""A Child Called It""--also true. I'm writing this at 4 a.m. because after watching this show, I can't sleep. Although I wouldn't have picked this show to watch, now that I have seen it I realize the importance of our world not EVER forgetting that this can and does happen. People know about it but don't want to admit it or ""pry"". Even though, in 2009, we'd like to believe the neighbors, CPS or the police would step in, I fear that is not the truth. This is an important movie and shouldn't be relegated to cable stations as a sensationalist movie.",2009

1,"This is a pointless presentation of a horribly sad story that deserved better. The casting was poor, acting laughable (especially Blythe as 14-yr-old Meg-- she looked every bit her 20 years and was amateur at best), dialog stupid and the David character a frustrating farce. Nobody decent (as David's character was supposed to be) would stand around for as long as he did and not tell his parents or somebody! And the neighbors were so clueless in this small town (where scandal and gossip is usually welcome amid the boredom) that they were unaware that the drunkard single mom on the block (divorced moms were suspect back then, too) was feeding alcohol to their own kids and raising a brood of bully, violent brats?

10,"I absolutely love this show. I'm the wife of a Guardsman but we live very close to Ft. Campbell, Kentucky and more than half of our church is stationed here. I realize that a lot of the comments here discuss technical issues like uniforms and those issues have already been addressed. If the actors went to jail for impersonating officers, we wouldn't have a great show! As far as story lines, exactly as said, it's a TV show first and foremost and it's supposed to be a little exaggerated. As for the show in general, I think it addresses the biggest issue of them all. It's fine and dandy for the country to ""Support the troops"" and what they do overseas. But no one ever takes into the consideration what the wives and families of these soldiers must sacrifice for the same cause. Year long or better deployments, in harm's way, forced into single parenthood, the worry of ever seeing the man you love alive again. As Claudia Joy Holden said in her speech at the July 4th picnic, ""We serve too"". And she's absolutely right. I can't tell you how heartbreaking it is to see women at my church week after week, holding their heads high, keeping it together for their children. And yes, they always manage to bring something for our socials! One woman picked up her child in the nursery shortly before her husband was due home from Iraq and said that her 1 year old was excited about seeing his father...for the first time. If that's not sacrifice, I don't know what is. Watch the show and enjoy it. Don't ruin it for yourself by dwelling on the petty things. Realize what you're watching is true life and should really be respected. God bless our troops!",2007
10,"I disagree with the first review of the show. As an Army Wife myself, I can say that the show was relatively realistic in our portrayal. The plot lines were interesting. Remember, it's only the first show. They're not going to jump into everything at once. Sit back and watch the show develop. While I understand that the first reviewer dealt with Army Wives, he WASN'T an Army Wife. It's an entirely different world. Again, that was the pilot episode. It makes no sense to jump into everything right away. Let the show develop, then decide if you like the show. I personally felt no disservice. Also, you were an officer. Much of the show was based on the Private's wife as she entered the military world. Being an enlisted wife is much different than being an officer's wife. I can safely say this with experience.",2007
8,"I am also a USMA grad. Unlike a previous poster, I served in Iraq and Afghanistan instead of ""rear detachment."" Also, unlike him, I am a woman. The problems posed are fairly accurate, especially the problems between the lieutenant colonel wife and her civilian doctor husband, and the problems posed by young enlisted soldiers marrying young women they barely know right before deploying. The only thing I don't agree with is the portrayal that senior officer wives get preferential treatment, for example, in the medical clinic. Then again, I'm a woman, and only a Captain, so who knows, maybe this does happen. I have certainly heard horror stories from my MPs who pulled over a colonel's wife who tries to ""pull rank."" I am excited to see the rest of the season!",2007
7,"I think the gossip and cattiness is dead on. The bartender who married an Army guy she knew 4 days...I had to laugh, in real life it would be a stripper. That said, she's one of my favorites. As a former dependent of a retired Marine, a former AF SSgt and now a Air Force wife, I find this show both brutally incorrect and laughably honest. I do agree about the lack of different nationalities. Just when I want to be a cynic about the whole show, I find myself feeling for them because I have been in pretty much all of their shoes. It is just a show, I can forgive the inaccuracies. It's just nice to see the military portrayed as flawed but striving to make the world better.",2008
10,"I absolutely love the show. I am retired Air Force, and I also happen to work on the old Navy Base here in Charleston where they film the show. I see them pretty regularly and have always thought Catherine Bell made every show she has been in. I can't wait to run into her somewhere and tell her how much I enjoy her work. It is nice to see the buildings and surroundings where I work every week on TV. The Physical Training field where the son was going through basic training at "" Fort Benning"" is right on the road to work for me every morning. I am happy to see the old Navy Base being used for something everyone can enjoy.Keep Army Wives here in Charleston for another season!! Love the show...Dave",2007
10,"I had been hearing all the buzz surround this new show called ""Army Wives"" and just had to check it out! I wasn't expecting to much considering it is on Lifetime. I watched the first episode and it was So-So but then about three or four episodes in I just fell in love! It was completely brilliant. It is one of those shows missing of late on TV clouded by mind-depleting reality horrors! Its one of those rare shows that touches the heart! I think the cast is brilliant and all have great chemistry together! I love Roxy and Pamela and their friendship so much. I will not lie and admit to the fact that Im a sucker for the Roxy and Trevor romance! Its just so sweet and something we all want in life! And not to mention the Drew and Sally have a fierce connection on screen together! Overall for the Type of Show it is and the network it is on I rated it as a Ten! Wildy unexpected that I fell in love! I would Recommend to all!",2008
8,"I personally think that this is one of the best summer shows on TV this season. It's dramatic (but not so much that you just want to call up the writers and be like, yeah that wouldn't happen), can make you cry, laugh and it's something I really look forward to Sunday night. All the characters are really likable and relatable which I really like. Though they are all different from each other they all kind of ""mesh"" together. Overall, I would definitely recommend this to anyone, it's a show for any generation. Some people are saying that it's very unrealistic in the sense of uniforms and such, but you just have to keep in mind that it's TV, it's never going to be 100% realistic, it never has been and never will be. So yeah, great show in my opinion!!",2007
10,"Spoilers I love this show; I love the characters; even Joan, who a lot of people might not have liked after what she did (not letting that soldier save that girl) she has a soft kind side to her. I saw a commnet where somebody said they hated her, but she is showing a different side in these later episodeds. It was so sad when Amanda died; I loved her character; she was one of the most innocent, but I believe that was the whole idea, innocent people die in war and terrorist attacks. Poor Geremy; they didn't show him as much after that; the father just mentioned how hard it was for him, which is expected. I was hoping to see his characor more; I guess they kind of took him off the show, or he was unable to do it. When I first saw the episode, I thought she was alive and her mother was taking her to college, but I guess it was supposed to be a surprise ending. I had to watch it twice to get it, but that just shows what a great show it was, that you get hooked even the second time! I mean I would have rather had Betty die, but in the last episode, she showed a kind side, and it seems all of the characors at some point show a good side. Joan did when she told Roxy that her husband was okay and when she decided to keep her baby knowing how much of a good father Roland would be. I loved how in last episode, they showed God on the episode helping Claudia and helping that little boy to help her. It was hysterical seeing that sweet little boy accompany her on a date; in a way he was sort of helping her!",2008
10,"""Army Wives"" is television's finest! I love everything about this show. It touches and reaches me on such a personal and emotional level. No other show has moved me to tears quite like this one. At first I thought that it was going to be entirely based on the army but it's actually the exact opposite. It's about real life and real women who have to fight their own battles to keep their family together. And it's hard to pick and choose favorites too. Every couple or family has their own special uniqueness and personality that draws you in and keeps you coming back each week for more. In the beginning you're introduced to five different families and each episode you learn more and more about their lives and what they've lived through and each one tells their own story. Eventually you just get so involved and wrapped up in all the people and their lives. Most of all though, the show is about friendship and how each wife finds a kindred spirit in the other. They're all there for one another during the good times and the bad. All of them are strong and independent women who go through so much but still manage to move on with their lives with a courage and bravery that comes only from the heart. This is so much more than just a show. Every episode leaves you wanting more. In fact, I even went out and bought the complete first season so that I'll always have every episode. A show of this caliber doesn't come around too often and this is one that I hope will last a very long time.",2008
10,"I myself was an army wife of an enlisted solider. As I watched this show it brought back many memories and made me laugh at times. It is so true the way the wives are portrayed. Even down to the way the homes are decorated and set apart. The officer wife going in to see the doctor before the PFC's wife, so true. The two women sitting back and talking about the pregnant girl, you really do find those on every post. The writers have really done a good job. I do not watch the show and critique every pin, patch, or award heck my husband many of times had to correct soldiers for the wrong uniform. Just sit back and enjoy the show and be proud that you were apart of that and can tell find the mistakes.",2007
8,I love this show and have watched each week. the characters are each great and the diff personality's make it so fun-,2007
4,"(My spoilers talk about incidents happening in the show, but never name who the involved characters are so the store is not ruined for anyone) This show is OK at best. Occasionally it is funny, but it is usually predictable, dull and not inventive at all. It also is a bad role model for young women who might be in a similar situation. So far, the show's attitude towards self respect is sickening. If your husband cheats on you and has a baby with another woman, then, for the love of self respect, DO NOT get back with him. Nobody deserves to be treated that way. There has been everything in this show from domestic violence, cheating, lack of loyalty and respect towards your spouse and the show's answer is always that the wife should suck it up, take the abuse and sit there quietly. This is very saddening to see on a show nowadays, and I think sends the wrong message to young women. The show is not good enough to excuse this kind of message and I wish I had not wasted time watching what I did of it.",2013
9,"Believe it or not, my boyfriend got me hooked on this show. Every episode is so emotional, whether you feel anger, sadness, happiness, etc. When I watch a TV show on a regular basis, I get very hooked on the characters & what happens to them. I love this cast, yes, even Joan. The second season completely changed the way I see her, knowing that she has that soft, motherly side. Roxy has some of the best lines, I still laugh at feeling like toe jam on an idiot cracker. Roland is a wonderful man, sure he makes mistakes, but don't we all. He is caring & not to mention hot! I am glad Trevor went through his addiction phase cause I was beginning to think they were portraying him too perfect. He is a good man for Roxy though. Pamela is so tough and I was so tense watching her go through the stalker thing, she was truly scared & I felt it with her. I don't know why for sure yet, but I don't really care very much for Chase, maybe its because he disappears so much, leaving the family without notice (I know that is not his fault though). Claudia Joy is truly a remarkable woman, has been through so much & stands by man no matter what. Michael is a likable character as well, you can tell how much he loves his wife. Denise, she is my girl, I understand some of the dumb choices she has made, but I still believe she has a good heart. Frank has taken her for granted for a long time, but he will have to realize what he has. I have only seen the first 2 seasons, but I did see part of an episode in 3, so I do know they get back together. I don't know what all is going on yet, but I do know that they were separated & they both strayed.",2009
10,"Tonight was the season 2 premiere of our beloved Army Wives. I have to say I watched it twice and I balled like a baby thru the last ten minutes the first time and when it came on again every scene with Claudia Joy and Amanda made me cry again. First of all you think it's bad enough with Marilyn dying but we saw that coming at the end of last season. Joan being nice to Roland is, to me, a bunch of crap because she's not gonna chose him over her career. I know how Roxy felt. I was an army wife for a while and I know that not knowing is worse than knowing. Joan being a beotch like that kinda ticked me off though. Pamela is our glue right now her and Denise. They are holding it together no matter how bad it hurts. I feel sorry for Jeremy too. Losing Amanda is like losing a part of all of our hearts. I can't imagine a better way to open the season though even as I wish Amanda was still with us. And I'll be waiting every week to see more.",2008
3,"Although this show shows a different side of the the military life, it has an awful way of portraying us as soldiers. I recently watched an episode about a guy holding two people hostage while reliving an experience in Afganistan. Though PTSD affects so many of us returning from the war, it seems that the show wants to portray us as insane people. We are soldiers fighting a war that was ordered to us to fight. I am proud to be a veteran of the OIF III War, but I am not insane. I only hope that people watching this program realize we have a job and a devotion of duty to our country. We follow orders and perform jobs many of the American population would not endure. We go to war as men and women, we return as men and women; only now we hold emotional scars. Thank you for this program, but realize this is a portral of a small percentage of those who return. The nightmares of the things I have done plague my dreams forever, but I am proud of what we have done, and be proud of those who fight for your freedom. God Bless America and God Bless You All.",2007
5,"This is important subject matter. It deserves important attention. After watching the premiere, it is obvious that the makers of the show have gone for the ""Melrose Place"" angle. They cloak the melodrama in the trappings of important issues. Sad, sad, sad. I am a veteran. I am a USMA grad. I once had the unpleasant but important task of serving as the rear detachment commander for an active duty Army unit which was deployed overseas. My job was to deal with...among other things...the wives and families left behind by the soldiers. Based on my experience, it seems to me that those responsible for the show do address real and complex issues, but they don't give them the appropriate amount of attention. The plot lines are not realistic, and they do a disservice to real Army wives. Out.",2007

It's wonderful to realize that the writer(s) did their homework...believe me, they skim the surface of all that goes on and I certainly wish I could add some of my experiences with changed names to protect the innocent/guilty.

10,"I love army wives, it's really weird to see the difference between countries. I live in the Netherlands and my boyfriend was in the military here. In the USA it's normal to live on the base while here it's normal that you sleep there but go home in the weekends. you don't have your own home just a room you need to share with somebody from the same group. Also i read everywhere and all the time how army wives really shows life on a army base as an army wife. I think it's really sad that every time you've just made friends and just starting to know everybody you have to move again. They also have similarities, there are people that live on the base here to, but because our country is so small it's not necessary (sorry for my bad English) you can drive threw my country within 3 hours, so why live on a base. I think, what i have seen from this realistic show, that living on a base brings the soldiers and there wives/girlfriends together, especially in times of war and deployment i think that is a plus in your country. This is the first show were i can feel and see that is't real. i want to give my respects to all of you. I don't know if i could do it, all tho, when the love is real you stand by your guy even if that means you have to give up some things you love, that earns respect! one last thing: I recommend this show, even if you are not an army wife, the story, drama and fun that's in it makes you fall in love with those woman every time you see them.",2010
7,I recently discovered this show and watched the entire first season and the first three of the second all in three days! The characters are so dynamic and interesting and I fall more in love with them every episode. I love the wide span of characteristics each person develops. I love how even though most of the wives are from different backgrounds they came together and bonded and seem to be the best of friends. They are all so different but yet share a common in fear in losing their husbands! This show isn't something seen on TV much anymore. Its hard to find a good show that is truly about its characters and how they touch each other heart. I don't know when the last time i watched a show that truly got to me and made me wonder if my friends husbands in the army and air force feel this same thing every time there husbands aren't with them!,2008

And I kind of enjoyed the story, it was a little odd and funny.",2007
6,"Bee Movie has its moments of brilliance, but they are few and far between, and I think what weakens this movie the most is the fact that most other movies have already beaten it to its punches. There's nothing too original here. Most notably, it bears many similarities to the 1998 animated film, Antz, starring Woody Allen as the insect living in a perfectly functioning society who begins to question his importance in the greater scheme of things. And much like DreamWorks' previous animated film, Sharktale, featured many fish-themed puns, Bee Movie tries the same thing, except with bee puns, and you'll learn fairly quickly that there's not a lot to work with in that area. And, let's face it: Larry King has appeared as himself in so many movies that the gimmick itself has become an irritating cliché. Here he is, in complete bee form. I think they've taken him as far as he can go.",2007

The script was much too mature for kids to watch; yet the piece was about kids, which wouldn't interest the adults. It was a coming-of-age story that would have issues entertaining anybody, despite the rich material. This is the biggest issue of Bee Movie.",2007

1,"When bee keepers are portrayed as evil scoundrels, it's time to question the intelligence of writers. Not only do they have no concept of bees and bee keeping, they don't know that only the sterile females do all the work. Male bees are DRONES, who do nothing but fertilize young queens. Which underscores why useless people are called drones. We might extend that term to include the writers and producers of this movie. Granted, animation is basically aimed at fanciful imagination and impossible situations. But let's keep it funny. Gross error and stupidity is not funny. Smokers don't kill bees - they discourage bee aggression. Even the ""ecological"" theme is skewed. The idea of entertainment is to entertain. This movie fails to do so. Undoubtedly, fans of Seinfeld and self absorbed urban culture will enjoy parts of this, but overall, it's awful. Jerry, revive ""Seinfeld"" if you want to parody New York culture, but spare us from further ""bumbling"" beez niss.",2008

Basically this bee goes outside and gets caught and then there's this really boring part in the middle and some stuff happens in court. Then all of the flowers die because the bees don't work anymore. This in itself made me angry that this movie was released but what happened next only made me angrier. The stupid bee and his human friend stole a float for and got on a plane for some reason. This, like I said made me angry but this next part took the freakin cake; the plane gets struck by lightning and everything fries. After than millions of bees come and land the plane. Airplanes don't work like that! Everyone should have died!",2008
9,"I must admit, my first impression was it would be just for kids. I was pleasantly surprised just how much of a kid I still am! The Bee Movie was an adventure in honey heaven. The cheerful animation and very funny script kept me flying high to the very end! I loved this movie. It lifted my spirit and helped me to relate to my own dull working world experience. I see so much potential in this film for sequels and spin-offs. A clever script and comic timing that only Jerry Seinfeld has mastered, this film is sure to take you on a journey. It blends fantasy and reality so delicately they are both interchangeable. Seinfeld was at his best. I also have a new respect for the little buggers (bees)! I recommend this movie to anyone who feels trapped in their routine... set yourself free and see the Bees!",2007
5,"For the first 30 minutes I thought that Bee Movie had a chance to become a classic like ""Toy Story"" but as the minutes ticked away, I realized it wasn't going to happen. Unlike Toy Story, Bee Movie does not have a central antagonist. Remember ""Sid"", the psycho kid who terrorizes the toys in Toy Story? What a marvelous creepy kid! Bee Movie offers up a number of limp opponents to Seinfeld's Barry B. Benson. There's the completely unfunny macho tennis player boyfriend in the beginning who is constantly trying to smash Barry to a pulp and an odious obese attorney who ends up having an allergy attack after he's stung by Barry's sidekick, Adam (couldn't understand why Adam was still alive after he stung the attorney--wasn't it established early on that bees die right away after they sting their target?).",2007

I took my 3 cousins (3 years to 8 Years) and they loved it but they wanted to get bees as pets.... try to explaining why a 3 year old can't have a bee as a pet. When i saw the parts in the court room the way the bees moved in sync it was amazing. It has nothing on the original computer generated movie ""Shrek"". It set all kinds of ground work for newer movies like The Bee Movie. The CG of the bees flying was a pretty cool look how they all flew in droves just like it was an actual bees taking flight. I think that there should be more family friendly films like this one. But, all in all it was a good Flick.",2007
1,"This pitiful exercise starts out as almost a carbon copy of 'Antz'. Playing the poor-man's Woody Allen again, Seinfeld's depiction of a Bee unsatisfied with his lot feels like a serious case of deja vu. ",2011
4,"Writing as a 14 year old girl, this movie is...mediocre. I didn't particularly want to see it in the first place, but there wasn't much else on at the cinema, so I was stuck.",2008
4,"As with many computer-animated films this is a sharply observed visual comedy grafted over hilarious voice-over. For about ten minutes. Then, amazingly, they run out of ideas. All the bee jokes are front-loaded and the film can't survive either on it's script - which has been left quite open for improvising - or on Seinfeld/Zellweger riffing - because that's a bit weak too.",2008
3,"Why? That is the important question. Why was this movie made at all? I know Seinfeld was a ""show about nothing"" and I am a Seinfeld fan. This was a movie about nothing, but unlike the TV show, Bee Movie was agonizingly unfunny, pointless, and meandering. Whoever green-lighted this script clearly has a substance abuse problem.",2007
10,"Bee movie is a thrilling experience a person of any age could find themselves immersed in. The casting for this movie could not have been done any better 69/10. Ben Stiller really makes me feel like I'm part of the honey bee's ecosystem. Through the ups and downs of Barry's adventure, Ben Stiller coveys the emotion that needs to be expressed, making me feel for Barry like I've never felt for any character ever. I cried, I laughed, I EXPERIENCED the emotional thrill ride that is Bee Movie. If you want a movie to wow and entertain your entire family, this is option #1. I have never seen such beautiful animation from any western developed anime. I was astounded by the amount of care put into every movement, every line of the script, and especially, into my heart. This movie will forever hold a place in my heart, making it one of the best, if not the best anime movies of all time.",2016
1,"My husband and I took our ten-year-old grandson to see this movie, assuming it would be a delight. It was not. My grandson laughed two or three times; same for me. My husband fell asleep. Boring is the best word I can think of to describe the movie. I will say that some of the writing directed at adults was clever, but it wasn't enough to carry the film. I'm a fan of Jerry Seinfeld, but even he couldn't make this movie something worth seeing. Many children's movies have lovely animation and cute little characters ... that just isn't enough ... they must be entertaining and interesting. Lots of children's movies have succeeded, but this one doesn't. Wait for the DVD rental.",2007
1,"What happened to Seinfeld? Did someone kidnap him and replace him with a dull identical twin? Those who loved his sitcom will be sorely disappointed by Bee Movie (which is, indeed, a B-Movie). The idea is not bad bees decide to sue humans for stealing their honeybut the execution is clumsy and there are very few laugh-out-loud jokes. All the talent in the film (and there's a lot: Renee Zellweger, Oprah Winfrey, Chris Rock, Matthew Broderick, Kathy Bates, etc) doesn't change the fact that there's very little about this movie that's original, witty, or funny.",2007
1,"With most CG animated movies, I can watch them more than once. This isn't the case with Bee Movie. I've tried to watch it again on two separate occasions and I absolutely could not. It is indescribably boring and unfathomably dull. I could watch paint dry and be more engaged than this. They could have taken the themes of working class life and run with it, made it something that could really touch adults. Instead, they pretty much abandon that in a flash for a crazy ""love story"" that never really seems like a love story at all. Then they bring in things about bee cruelty, which intend to make the viewer ""look through a bee's eyes"" and abruptly abandon that for... I really don't know anymore. It's just one giant, honey-flavored mess. It's also laden with cheesy bee jokes and overused talent. Patrick Warburton and John Goodman have done enough animated movies recently to satisfy an entire century. So, in short, don't see this. It's easily one of Dreamworks' worst.",2008
1,"Was that a kids movie i just saw? I went with my son, and unfortunately the guts of the movie was based in COURT. They could have had so much fun with the story line, but where do they take it??? to the most boring and UN-childlike place on the planet. Where have all the good movies gone? We need some bad guys, some adventure, and some fun! Kids wont enjoy it, maybe teenagers. The fact they shot winnie the pooh, maybe funny for adults who know that its just a joke, but for little kids who love winnie, HOW COULD THEY???? The jokes were not funny, i did however laugh a little at the end. If you are going to make a movie for kids, let your hair down, have some fun with it, and Don't bring in adult politics that kids shouldn't and don't want to watch in their movies.",2007
1,"This movie was previewed as a wonderful little kids film about bees. And that's how they reel you in. You see little cgi bees and you think that, ""Awe, how could something so cute be so horrible?"" And then you hear that Jerry Seinfeld is in it and you think, ""Awe, I liked his TV show. How could he not be funny."" And then you hear about the big name actors in it and think, ""Awe, how could all these terrific actors with successful careers ever be in a bad movie?"" Then you see it... and all you think is ""Awful. Simply and horrendously awful. Awful in the 'I just lost $8.50' way."" The overall story was not engaging and felt empty.",2007
8,"Mr. Bean's Holdiay was a movie I really enjoyed. Mr. Bean was back in true form, and delivered an unexpectedly funny movie. Part of Mr. Bean's humor is when something is about to happen, you can see it from a mile away, and you yell at the screen ""look out Mr. Bean!"" or ""He left it on the counter! Oh No!"" or what have you. There is plenty of this,but there is also a great deal of irony and clever wordplay in it as well. It's a well rounded comedy movie, that will be funny to children and adults alike. I'm not really a big Mr. Bean fan, but I really liked this movie anyway, and I know that most people will too, if they give it a chance. I will definitely recommend this movie to my friends, and to anyone who reads this review.",2007
10,"If you asked a handful of people of varying ages in America, chances are you'd get about 8 out of 10 knowing who he is. They may not know Rowan's real name, but they know the character.",2007
7,"Here's the deal: Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE has panned Mr. Bean's Holiday for being unfunny, a cow milked dry, same old same old, blah blah blah. Either these people just don't have a sense of humour, if I may be that harsh, or they didn't even see the flick and just reviewed it based on the weak trailer and their own false assumptions. I on the other hand have seen this movie and I can honestly say that it blew me away. It is not only about ten times better than its weak 1997 predecessor (which the film wisely ignores completely), it is a genuinely great movie. It's a feel-good movie which actually makes you feel good (!!) and never turns into awkward sappiness. It is also absolutely hilarious and, thank god, unlike the original movie this one doesn't recycle gags from the TV series.",2007
9,"I don't understand the bad comments here. I saw the movie just now at a press screening in Bangkok. I did not expect much (because I read the negative comments yesterday), but it was very good! It's not rocket science, it's just another Mr. Bean movie. I even thought this one was better than the first one, especially in the second half of the movie. The end was a bit over the top, but that's only for the last two minutes, you will see why.",2007
9,"This hasn't quite been the great year for movies that I had hoped for, but it has certainly been a very good year for comedies, and ""Mr. Bean's Vacation"" is the best so far. It is also quite a daring film -- who would have imagined a G-rated, live action comedy these days, and without any fart jokes? Where's Mel Brooks when we need him? Just kidding. ",2007
10,"That's a excellent film, I really loved it! Again Rowan Atkinson give us his classical character Mr. Bean. From beginning to end it is a very sweet and warm hearted film! It is a great film for kids and adults! I only hope that Rowan will revisit this character again! We need more Mr. Beam! The acting is perfect a way above many comedians! Clearly we can notice the inspiration from ""Mr. Hulot's Holiday (USA)""",2007
9,"I don't wish to go on and on as Mr bean is a character whom each individual has their own views on, some love him and some hate him however this film, for most fans, is a welcome return to the 'classic' bean we knew in the TV series far less 'americanised' than in the ultimate disaster movie. It seems that Rowan has taken bean to a new emotional level resembling classic silent artists such as Keaton and at times Chaplin, some scenes seem very reminiscent of ""the kid"" and help keep peoples attention to the story, not just Beans funny movements, though at times it drags slightly. There are of course aspects which have been included to accommodate an international audience but that is expected. In an effort not to give any of the film away and there's little dialogue to quote all I can say is that I enjoyed the film and felt that this is the Bean i saw as a child and Rowans ability to emote with facial expression alone should place him amongst the greats in silent entertainment.",2007
8,"Rowan Atkinson had disappeared off our screens for a little while. After the critical mauling of Johnny English he sort of vanished into thin air for a while. Personally I can never understand why the critics savaged Johnny English as much as they did, sure it was flawed but it was pretty funny. Now, however Rowan Atkinson has returned, and he's brought along his most well loved character to date. Mr Bean is back, ladies and gentlemen! Now for some people this will cause great excitement, for others it will cause them to groan very loudly. You see Mr Bean is an acquired taste, and after seeing this movie I can still very much say that Mr Bean is an acquired taste. If you dislike Mr Bean in the first place the odds are extremely high that you will hate his latest outing. I on the other hand really like Mr Bean, not love, but I enjoy his sketches and the last movie was pretty funny. This movie in my eyes is a bit better despite still being overly sentimental and some comedy moments feeling a bit too forced. But this is a movie of small pleasures, this doesn't deliver witty comedy, in fact a lot of humour relies on either slapstick or embarrassing situations, yet the comedy still feels fresh and you can't help but enjoy it all along.",2007
7,"After too long on our screens Mr. Bean returns but not in his usual way. Instead of crazy laughs per minute (as in Bean and the earlier Mr. Bean TV episodes), this is a road trip movie with some gaps in the action. There are laughs but some of the scenes are more clever than hysterical. Nothing however can take away from the joy of sharing in Mr. Bean's exploits as he tries to reach his simple goal, a holiday at the beach. Everyone left the film with huge smiles and several had tears of happiness (not tears of uncontrollable laughter). If you want to see a happiness inducing pick me up movie then this is one of the best around.",2007
6,"Last week i took the girlfriend to see '300', this week it was her turn to pick the film... her choice... Mr Beans Holiday. I wasn't too impressed with this but fair is fair! I couldn't remember much of the first film but wasn't expecting to be blown away or enjoy it to be frank! However i was pleasantly surprised and am not ashamed to admit i enjoyed it. Don't get me wrong, this is no classic but it is a enjoyable film. The first thing i liked was the fact it wasn't set in America, so i didn't have to listen to a number of Americans try to explain who this Mr Bean character was! I didn't laugh out loud, but I did chuckle along at the jokes and enjoyed some of the darker aspects such as the mobile phone gags! When i saw Karel Roden pop up early on in the film i chuckled to myself as he filmed the camcorder... thinking back to the film '15 minutes' (if you've seen it you'll understand what i mean) This helped me loosen up and allowed me to enjoy the film. Also loved the whole Carson Clay in love with himself film moment near the end.",2007
8,"Mr. Bean, or Rowan Atkisnon, may seem one dimensional man, but here he is impeccable. He plays with a real gusto and his gags are great.Any time he does a gig, that is really funny/ His trip to Cannes is a real gem of laughs - he separates the son of a Russian film maker, he forgets his passport, he loses his money and tickets, he only managed to keep his video camera and make his documentary. Who is really great here is Willem Defoe as a bombastic film maker who loves himself so much that he makes stupid, silly films that make people sleep. Watch it for fun, for real relaxation, for real great time. Mr. Bean is not a serious masterpiece of cinema, but he is fresh, upbeat and this longer film is a great insight into a rural France, as well as bigger Paris and glamor Cannes.",2007
9,"Content:""""Like everyone is saying about this movie"": stop listening to all the snob critics and go see this movie at home, in theater, i recommend watching it with a couple of friends cause its guaranteed absolute fun. Rowan Atkinson is one of the best comedians/performers and entertainers of all time. He is the whole movie; thats why it's worth watching, his sheer stupidity in expression and the fact that he says only a couple of words the whole movie ""Oui"" and ""Gracias"", cracks me up. Your mom said don't trust strangers but everyone who submitted a comment agrees with me, Mr Bean's holiday is an amazing comedy, a feel good movie, better than any movie so far released this year. Get some popcorn, lay back and enjoy a great family movie.",2007
8,"It's Mr. Bean again and I really appreciate his effort. I think the movie isn't that bad, not as bad as people talk. There were so many scenes that I found really funny and entertaining. I love the fact that this one takes place in France and I get a chance to see the beauty of it. It's great I think. And yes Mr. Bean still shows his silliness in front of the screen.",2007
10,"I have watched this movie twice, first with my family and then again with family and friends. My husband watched it even three times.We all love it. It is clean, it is funny, it is suitable for kids and parents alike. We laughed non-stop the first and the second time. Personally, I think Ron Atkinson is a genius. He reminds me of Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. If some people need the farts and vulgar entertainment, well, too bad for them. The movie has got great gags and makes fun of pretentious, self-appointed important film makers. What a refreshing change from the usual Hollywood rubbish and the usual, boring Hollywood windbags! Bravo to Ron! I hope it is not true that this was the last Mr. Bean movie.",2008
8,What I loved about this movie is that It's NOT a mere series of destructive events people expected. This movie is about the 7th Art and how humor was built within it along the years.,2007
9,"What I absolutely don't understand is what part of this movie people weren't satisfied with. If you aren't a Bean fan, then you obviously shouldn't watch this movie. With Mr. Bean, you either love him or you hate him, there is no middle ground, so you should know whether or not this movie will be worth your cash and your time. Like some people before me have stated, people who don't like this movie should check out ""The Playback"" by Carson Clay. ",2007
8,"Mr Bean is back and is again going to be causing more disaster! Rowan Atkinson still plays the part tremendously. 19 years later and is still playing the same guy. Rowan Atkinson just never seems to want to get old. He still looks young and as fit as anything. Rowan Atkinson does his stunts in this movie too. The acting is somewhat good. What this movie tends to do is not be funny for 5 minutes and then they throw in a laugh out loud joke. It doesn't seem to fail once. This film is a movie for everyone of all ages. All the kids and adults were laughing all the way through it. Don't believe all the critics or haters. It's exactly the same with Meet The Fockers. Whenever there's a comedy sequel people bash it, and guess what? They haven't seen it or all of it. So ignore the haters and enjoy a laugh out loud joke every 5 minutes or so.",2007
9,"I remember when I saw the first movie at the theater in 1997. I and my  friend gave an applause when credit titles started.. and everybody in  the theater joined us. The local newspaper critic was there too and  mention about is on his analysis. It was a nice movie, however not as  good as the TV-series.  You can imagine how much I've been waiting for this next film. And was  it worth it? This movie made me happy. I recommend it to anybody who's  looking for a good hearted, funny movie and has enjoyed Mr Beans  adventures before. It's more like the TV-shows than the previous movie.  Less talk, more action.  With a Russian kid (Max Baldry), French girl (cute Emma de Caunes) and  British Mr Bean language barrier gives many jokes.  One thing was missing from this silver screen version however: it  didn't have the scene where Mr Bean destroys a laptop on a train.. it  was shown on a trailer. Shame, it gave me good laughs. I suppose it'll  come with DVD.",2007
10,"I just came back from watching Mr. Bean's Holiday a second time and my face still hurts from laughing. I admit, I've been a Mr. Bean fan for many years but this movie is the best Mr. Bean yet.

7,"I enjoyed a lot this movie...it made me lo-ugh for the first time in a long time...Rowan Atkinson does a wonderful performance playing Mr. Bean...The story of the movie is simple:Mr. Bean wins a trip to France...But in reaching France he passes through a lot of adventured, partly of his lack of knowledge of the language...I liked the idea of the movie, the lack of dialogs, made me like more this movie and especially enojy Mr. Bean's gags...Another thing that i liked is the fact that this film is fille with very interesting scenes,very funny and original...The ""tie scene"" and ""doing everything not to fall asleep scene"" are in my opinion very original...I awnt to add that the movie also had some sad parts, but this made me appreciate all the more this movie...I gave it a 7 cause it really impressed and changed my day.",2007
10,"A wonderful movie! Rowan is great! As Aways.I'm a big fan of Rowan Atkinson and his comedic person Mr. Bean . I Heard that this will be his last movie, what a shame :( I Don't have words to describe how incredible actor is Rowan. Ten years ago when i was a little boy it was very funny when we watched the Mr. Bean's series. Mr. Bean's Holiday is also a very good movie.I have laugh a lot. There were a very funny and interesting moments all over the movie, with the chicken, with the making of some war movie...also the movie by Willem Dafoe was very funny :)))) Mr. Bean's friend( the girl) was very nice and cute :P It's true that i don't like the French very much but she was OK. That's from me, regards from Bulgaria",2007
10,"I thought it was just terrific!I was looking forward to seeing it in theaters and after that I was stunned by how great and really hilarious it was.Mr.Bean has always been my favorite show ever since I was little and although the jokes in his first movie weren't as funny as the show, this sequel to the first was hilariously brilliant.",2007
7,"My husband and I took our two boys (ages 6 and 9) to this movie. We are avid Bean fans and have the DVD set that spans Atkinson's career as Mr. Bean. Is Mr. Bean's Holiday the greatest comedy ever? Probably not. However, as a parent I find it very difficult to take my boys to movies and this was one of the few times where I actually felt we were at a family picture. When was the last time a movie was rated G? My boys had a wonderful time watching the site gags, and they followed along with the subtitles, which I thought was good for them. My husband and I had a fun time and unlike many children's movies, there was no sarcastic attitude, which I find is so prevalent in films right now. Some people have cited that they felt Mr. Bean's relationship to a child in the movie was inappropriate, but I did not get that vibe from the film. Also, Atkinson has used children in his Bean skits for years, always with funny results. I think people may read too much into it. Remember, Bean is pretty much a boy himself. While I think an adult who has no familiarity with Bean may find it all rather ridiculous, this is good family fare that parents can feel comfortable with. As I tell my boys, sometimes it is just fun to be silly.",2007
9,"Last night I went to a screening of this film and didn't know what to expect. I have to say this is the best Adam Sandler comedy since Happy Gilmore. It seems that with this new comedy duo that Sandler got his magic back. This story is about two firefighters in Brooklyn who have been best friends for what seems like forever. Larry Valentine (James) is a single dad trying to raise two kids on his own and Chuck Levine (Sandler) is a notorious playboy who has a new girl(s) every night. When Larry tries to change his beneficiary from his late wife to his children he finds out that the process would take a long time. Because he's a firefighter, and worries that he could go at anytime, he wants to make sure his kids will be OK. After a traumatic incident he feels even more pressure. When he finds a loophole in the system, he asks Chuck to be his domestic partner. Throughout the movie their relationship is under fire and it's up to their attorney, Alex (Jessica Beal), who believes they're gay, to save them from criminal charges. They try to keep their relationship a secret but it eventually gets out that they're a couple. Everyone they know starts treating them differently and they are witness to the discrimination homosexuals face on a regular basis. Little do they know, when they defend themselves, they defend gay people in general. Dan Aykroyd plays their Captain at the fire house and is also their voice of reason. Steve Buscemi plays an inspector who is sent to their house to catch them at their game. There are numerous cameos, by some of everyone's favorites, and they show up at some of the most random times making their appearance in the movie that much funnier. When I left the theater I felt like a did 100 crunches because I was laughing so hard. It didn't drag, and it didn't get overly sappy, at any point. Some of the jokes are stereotypical, but it's the first time most of them have been on the big screen so it was fresh humor. I sat next to my gay friend through the screening and I've never seen a man laugh so hard in my entire life. So, for all you people who think this movie will be a bash at homosexuals, I say watch the movie and then make your opinions. I enjoyed this movie so much that, when it comes out in July, I will PAY to go see it with my friends.",2007
5,"This is a film where Adam Sandler literally tries too hard to act manly and cool. This is a very stereotypical movie with a lot of gay jokes thrown in, and has some sexist images of women. Charles ""Chuck"" Levine (Sandler) and Lawrence ""Larry"" Valentine (James) are veteran FDNY fire fighters. And during there routine Chuck almost gets killed and Larry saves his life. Soon Larry realizes he has difficulties naming his children as primary beneficiaries in his life insurance due to the death of his wife. So in order to get his benefit he needs to get married. Larry asks Chuck to enter a pretend marriage with him after Larry read a article about domestic partnerships. Chuck declines at first, but is reminded of his debt to Larry so he agrees. The main highlight of this film is when Alex McDonough(Jessica Biel) is thrown into the mix, who play Chuck and Larry's lawyer. I however disliked Adam Sandler in this movie, he just tries way too hard to prove he isn't gay in this film to point it gets a bit annoying and he is like banging every girl that crosses his path in this one, yeah firemen get girls but c'mon. At times it had it's moments and had some funny jokes but it really drags and don't know how to quit. I think it would have been awesome if Chuck and Larry eventually found out they are gay for each other cause Chuck is a sleazy gay character, but I doubt Adam Sandler would do it since he has such a high image of himself which I realized after I finished watching this movie. Basically the film is about Adam Sandler trying really hard to look manly, while there is a bunch of stereotypical gay jokes thrown in. Jessica Biel was really hot and attractive in this and is the main highlight of this film and finds herself in many situations in her underwear. Which is the main point, but her assets is a nice touch, so I can't complain.",2009
8,"OK it is full of stereotypes, yes the movie does old jokes, it is fairly predictable and we have seen it before. The crucial question is this  is it funny? The simple answer is yes. My wife wasn't enthused about this one, but she laughed heartily. For a comedy to be any good you need to laugh out loud at least 6 times. I think I laughed about 10-12 times. Some of the scenes were set up really well and the comedy acting was superb.",2007
1,"Is it possible to claim to support marriage rights for same-sex couples and still be homophobic? After seeing ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry"" the answer is yes. Two heterosexual Brooklyn firemen (Kevin James and Adam Sandler) file a domestic partnership claim so that one of the men can protect his children in case of his death, him being a widower. In spite of the specious setup, the opportunities for a charming farce were all there, but Sandler (and director Dennis ""as an actor I was who they got when they couldn't get Bruce Dern so I now direct bad comedies instead"" Dugan) mucked it up with a bunch of lame jokes and condescending stereotypes of gays.",2008
1,"By far the worst comedy of the year. I do not know why anyone would think that Chuck and Larry was funny. Not only was this movie not believable, it was boring. In no way was this movie believable. If you actually think Gay men act this way, then you are living on the moon. I don't know why certain actors even had cameos in this film. This movie wasn't even remotely funny. The plot was dumb, the jokes were bad, and the movie was way too long. Chuck and Larry was not funny at all and was borderline offensive at times. Save yourself 2 hours and watch anything else with Adam Sandler or Kevin James. This movie is not worth the time. You will thank me for it!",2007
9,"I saw this movie yesterday with my boyfriend, my best friend, and another male. Several minutes into the movie I turned to my best friend and whispered ""What have these guys dragged us to?"" and rolled my eyes at the movie that I assumed would be another hour and a half of male oriented comedy. I was way wrong. Half an hour into the movie my sides hurt from laughing, and by the end I couldn't stop smiling at not only the humour, but the surprising good moral taught by this movie. ",2007
6,"This film is basically an average comedy. You can poke a lot of holes in the plot and there is a lot of stupidity. Yet, there are some parts that make you laugh out loud. This is an entertaining film, but your own sense of humor should dictate whether you want to see it or not.",2007
4,"I'm really sorry that I paid for this movie and lost my time... the 4 stars I give to the movie are for the message, which, after all, can't be denied to be cute... love is all in the end! I haven't really seen that many movies with Adam Sandler in them, but the ones I've seen, I've liked them, so I thought, hey, Adam's in a gay movie, great!...",2007
1,"I'm not comparing the two movies, that would be sillier than Chuck and Larry put together. But, we're living the times that we're living and things do matter and things mean more than what they mean and everything means something. So, who's idea was this? Reactionary even in its attempt to be compassionate, tolerant and understanding. The film is not an insult to the issue of gays and gay marriage but to comedy itself. For instance: Chuck and Larry firefighters try to save a massively overweight man from a fire, the man falls on top of them and farts. Yep, that's the standard. Of course the movie opened to grosses large enough to demote Harry Potter himself to second place so they know what they're doing and I'm not sure what planet I'm living in. Richard Chamberlain and Lance Bass make special appearances, oh dear, oh dear. The appeal of Adam Sandler is way beyond me. I kind of liked him in in the PT Anderson movie and in Spanglish he was alright but those films didn't quite perform at the box office so I fear that Chuck and Larry is here to stay. Pity for him and pity for us.",2007
2,"It was hard for me to get past the premise that Larry had to be married in order to have his pension go to his children if he died. That made no sense at all and was not believable. And why would he even want Sandler's character to raise his children, given his wild bachelor lifestyle? But, I reminded myself that it was a comedy and I let the movie's ridiculous premise go. Still, there wasn't much to laugh at in the movie. I'm heterosexual but felt it made fun of gay people and played up stereotypes. Why was just about everyone at an AIDS fund raiser flamboyantly gay? Why did the wedding chapel guy have to have stereotyped Asian speech and appearance reminiscent of racist films from the 1930s? (I know Rob Schneider is part Filipino, but it was still bad). And why did the women have to be such bimbos? I know, it was a comedy, but it was so offensive that I found very little humor in it.",2007
1,"I went into the movie with very low expectations, having read about how awful it was with regards to gay stereotypes. But what I didn't expect was for everyone who isn't a white straight male to be stereotyped. There were only two men who weren't white in the entire movie; one was an Asian caricature to a degree that I thought was extinct since the fifties, and the other one is the only black guy on the force – so of course he also doubles as the huge scary (crazy) guy. He's notable becomes a double offense when he, form the moment that he comes out of the closet, turns into a mincing sissy. This is supposed to be comedic, because can you imagine a big black guy who isn't scary? Or a black guy who I gay? What a hoot! The movie also suffers from rampant misogyny, depicting every single woman as a first class idiot who's naturally all over Chuck. ",2010
1,crude. In every sense! ,2007
1,"This movie is typical Adam Sindler. Absolute garbage. Adolescent tripe. Maybe if you are fourteen you might enjoy this movie, but even then you would have to be BRAIN DEAD! Come on, are you kidding me. More Hollywood crap pushing the envelope. Where are the good movies that actually engage the mind? These guys can't even act. I suppose you watch this to get a naughty little snicker. It is sad that this is what passes for humor with the obligatory fat kid and his fart, to the hot chicks and stupid sex humor. I don't consider myself a prude, heck, I grew up in the 70's and did the drugs etc. but c'mon... Pure junk! Well, I was I going to quit here but they won't let me, I guess there is a rule that a comment has to have ten lines. So, shall I say it any clearer... Find a better movie, any movie without Adam Sindler would be an upgrade!",2007
3,"For this writer, the attraction of each Adam Sandler film becomes lower and lower. I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry finally takes the cake, or breaks the tolerance; ironically when this films preaches about tolerance, to how lazy each film is and how far this film verges on insulting. In hind sight after viewing Chuck and Larry, there is an episode of South Park, which looked at gay marriages, also another episode on tolerance. As far yielding South Park has with its PC levels, the outcome is satire and social commentary gold. Screenwriters Alexander Payne, Barry Fanaro and Jim Taylor; looking at Payne and Taylor's previous films Sideways and About Schidt, something isn't right here. All three scrape the bottom of the barrel, digging up every cliché and stereotype to whip up a film more insulting than actually bringing awareness.",2007
1,Dumb premise.,2007
1,"Though they make money, Sandler's fish out of water comedies never fully worked in the past, and this one doesn't work at all! I went in with an open mind, but once I got ten minutes in, I knew I would hate this. In this stupid movie, Larry (Kevin James) wants to gay marry Chuck (Sandler) so he knows his kids will be taken care of. Of course they go through all sorts of wacky situations to make them seem gay, and bad humor ensues. One reason I may have hated this more than other Sandler films is the characters. I liked Larry Valentine and if Sandler decides to make more buddy comedies he should use Mr. James. Chuck on the other hand is an awful character. He is supposed to be comically bad for laughs, but he is such a bad person that you wonder why anyone is friends with this jerk. Every bit of humor in this was brainless including a scene where Chuck finds a marijuana cigarette has started a fire, and being a professional fireman, he shoots the owner of it in the face with a fire extinguisher and everyone, including the fire captain (Dan Aykroyd) laughs. One scene Chuck and Larry save a fat man from his fiery grave and instead of leaving the house or trying to put out the fire, they laugh that the fat man farted in the burning house. There's many more problems I have with everything but I'll just shorten it to, this was a really bad movie.",2007
3,"If fart jokes and predictable plot/gags are your thing, then you surely won't be disappointed. The setup is promising enough, two hetero guys in masculine (some might suggest homoerotic) job such as firemen, get a civil partnership in order to reap the benefits if Chuck (who isn't covered by similar life insurance policies, unusual in a fireman- the same cynical few would say), dies in a toasty manor... cue 'flaming queen jokes' ",2007
1,"This might just have been the worst film I've ever seen. It is not a comedy, not at all, because the jokes in it is just NOT funny, they are so cheap and easy that you would believe that someone wrote the script in one hour and fifty minutes! The fact that this film's got 6.2 on IMDb is simply quite disturbing and makes me wonder how stupid people these days are! I felt it as my responsibility to warn other potential watchers of this film, PLEASE DO NOT WATCH IT! And what the heck is up with Adam Sandler! He have to be the worst actor ever, and he seems to appear in all the wrong movies! And don't listen do them who thinks this is an excellent movie, they are either idiots or they have been doing something else than watching the film...",2009
3,"I'm straight but I don't have anything against gays. In fact, I don't think there's anything wrong with the moral ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry"" hammers to the viewing public. The problem of the latest comedy from star/co-producer Adam Sandler, however, lies not in its message, but in how it's played out - with exasperatingly blatant approach complete with all the stereotypes as one could expect from, well, Adam Sandler.",2007
3,"Lame premise, lame movie. My mistake was accidentally seeing the Wedding Singer years ago and always assuming somehow, someway Adam Sandler will get back to that level. Instead he disappoints in movie after movie. I thought Kevin James might be able to keep him focused. Apparently the only person that can rein in Sandler's worst impulses and actually make a good movie is Drew Barrymore.",2007
5,... this movie is firmly lodge.,2008
9,"This film manages to drag out all the stereotypes about gays and gay marriage and to actually present them in an entertaining and even uplifting manner. There is something to be said for frankness, when dealing with the inner (and outer) gayness. So, there are subplots galore involving very horny men of various persuasions and closet gays, who are inspired to come out, based on their perceptions of the openly gay marriage of Adam Sandler and Kevin James.",2007
5,Steve Carell reprises his role as Evan Baxter in this sequel to Bruce Almighty.,2007
8,"Evan Almighty generated a lot of hype before its release. A lot of people loved Bruce Almighty, and were expecting something just a zany and hilarious in Evan Almighty. Most of them were disappointed: this movie was received negatively by most critics and audiences alike. Well, I liked it! First of all, this movie has been misunderstood, because it was mismarketed. It was marketed as a hilarious sequel to Bruce Almighty (and the trailer made it look that way, too). But, to be perfectly honest, this is more of a family film than a comedy. But it is a really good family film.",2009
7,"Steve Carell returns as prissy newsreader Evan Baxter, a little less mean-spirited this time around unlike his previous small turn in 'Bruce Almighty'. Of course, Carell was up and coming then but as his box-office success shows, the character responsible for arguably the only really funny scene in 'Bruce Almighty' deserves a film of his own. Shadayac and co. have approached it with a novel (if potentially expensive idea) to make God (Morgan Freeman) appear this time to instruct Baxter to build an Arc and, as Noah did before him, load it full of animals to protect them from an for an oncoming flood. It's an idea that's very entertaining, even if the jokes are less easy than the previous premise. Evan's transformation of appearance and being pursued by eager animals are the main areas of humour here, which means at times the film is thin on the ground. Sentiment comes in the form of Evan's neglect of his family; the audience will know exactly where this will be going, but fortunately the sentiment isn't as annoying as you might believe. It's also very much a family affair, the humour and the language very much for family audiences. Disappointingly, Shadayac, responsible for bringing out two of Jim Carrey's worst performances (namely 'Liar Liar' and 'Bruce Almighty') by letting Carrey overdo it by seemingly telling him to do the whole thing as an impression of William Shatner, mistakenly this time opts to take Carell down a notch. Carell's trademark hysteria and bizarre reactions are in short supply and we have an all together calmer 'Little Miss Sunshine'-esquire turn, which also means the film loses some of it's potential in this instance. Wanda Sykes and co. are merely stock characters needing better dialogue. Does this make it a bad film? Not at all. It's religious tie-ins (if rushed) are quite smart and it's very well directed visually with a great use of music and keeping a steady pace. It is what's on the label, but with a jaw-droppingly impressive final act which will really take you by surprise and could be up there as one of the sights of the summer! You could do a lot worse than enjoy 100 minutes of easy-going fun but if it's a laugh-out-loud roller-coaster you want, you will leave short-changed!",2007
1,"'A comedy of biblical proportions!' Those masters of hyperbole, the movie-tag-line-writers, at it again; the sequel to 2003's Bruce Almighty, raises barely a chuckle. The only thing which raises my interest in this movie above total indifference is its dogmatic Christian undertones. Sorry, make that overtones.",2007
1,I recently saw this movie on TV. I held off for a long time since I've always had low expectations. In the end I'm glad I didn't pay to see it.,2014
6,"Did some one say comedy... this cannot be categorized as a pure comedy and it doesn't come under the cadre of Bruce Almighty and Steve Carell though he tried hard is not match to Jim Carrey. This is not a pure comedy and has its own emotional scenes to counter your comic feelings while watching the movie..... Buy your popcorn and drink before you go to the movie and don't expect to have a pain in your gut because you don't do any big laughing exercise in it. Still it has kept with its pace, being a smaller movie of less than 100 minutes adds to its advantage.",2007
8,"If you go expecting to see a gut-busting laugh-out-loud comedy like the usual Jim Carrey-Tom Shayac production, you'll be disappointed. (But it also doesn't have the bathroom humor -- a relief to me.) ",2007
4,"One hundred and seventy five million dollars is a hell of a lot of money to spend on even the biggest summer blockbuster. Not even Michael Bay had a budget that big for Transformers, so exactly how Universal Pictures spent that much cash making Evan Almighty is a mystery. They certainly didn't spend it on the script for one thing as the film is not so much a classic comedy as it is Christian flag waving and bar one or two quiet chuckles, you're most likely to spend the duration wondering where the budget went or why Steve Carrell felt the need to slum it in a decidedly average movie at the exact moment when his star profile has begun to rise.",2007
4,"Although I enjoy Steve Carrell's work, Evan the Almighty, like so many other overdone films turned out to be a lot worse than I hoped it would be.",2007
1,"Well, for this abomination of a film, I wasn't expecting anything good. I find Steve Carell annoying, and Bruce Almighty was pretty good but there is absolutely no reason for it to have a sequel. Somehow, this film was even lower than my expectations, even when I didn't have any. ",2007
4,"This was a flick doomed from its conception. The very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie. I wasn't the least bit interested. Then came the trailer. Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer. It's like a 3-minute Cliff's Notes version of the flick. So obviously I wasn't gonna pay to see it, but once it hit DVD, I thought sure, I'll watch it for free. Maybe Steve Carell can save it.",2007
6,"This movie turned out to be a little better than I thought. Steve Carroll was funny as usually. The animals were cool too. Some of them were real, but a lot of them were computer generated. I thought the film sent a good message. That spending family time is important and that is what God was trying to teach the Baxter's. I liked the part that Evan couldn't cut his hair or beard and then then the Moses robes added to the effect. I have to take away some praise though with the whole ark floating though Washington DC. That was just plain silly. Wanda Sikes gets some good one liners too.",2008
5,"This was, simply put, a bad movie. As a big fan of Steve Carell, I had high hopes, at least for his performance. Unfortunately, he could do nothing to save it. There were even times when I found him to be incredibly annoying. The pace is too fast, to the point where watching the beginning of the film is like seeing a montage of events that happened prior. There is little to no character development, especially for Evan's family. While the film is visually stunning, an overinflated budget cannot always save a film from a poor script, poor acting, and poor direction. Don't waste your time unless you're with children.",2007
2,"I actually said that out-loud at the advanced screening I attended for this movie. This is about as safe a comedy as you can find. Even the lone child in the audience of 50 was bored by this disappointment. I'm not quite sure what the other reviewers of this movie saw, but they are obviously brain washed. The only redeemable quality of this movie was its 88 minute length. Everything was rushed, the dialog was laughably bad, and the slap-stick humor didn't work. The following scene sums up this movie perfectly: God is explaining to Evan that anyone can change the world with one act of random kindness - he then writes 'ARK' into the sand, ""ACTS of RANDOM KINDNESS"", YUCK!!!!!",2007
2,Honestly one of the two most disappointing movies I have ever seen (the other being Big Top Pee Wee). Let me first state that I was really looking forward to this movie. I really liked Bruce Almighty (part one). I also thought the idea of having the sequel being centered around the Noah story was a strong idea. I felt you bring back Steve Carrell and bring back Morgan Freeman. That is was an interesting way to get by without Jim Carrey. Afterall Steve Carrell is a rising Hollywood starthe next Jim Carrey or Will Farrell. I saw the clips of Steve with his beard and Noah get upthe visual looked funny to me. I thought there was room for some funny scenes with Animals.,2007
4,"Yep, you can take your kids to watch this film, or if you're an average American - you're gonna like it. To me it's all boredom and classical neo-American brainwashing for brainwashed generation to have some light fun, without using too much brains. Pot-heads should like it, too - very light on synapses.",2007
3,"This movie was a failure as a comedy and a film in general. It was a very slow paced movie that seemed to be trying to convey a message, but the message was a cliché, hopeless mess to begin with. This movie falls on shameless environmental point, even making a self-righteous point of destroying an SUV and promoting Animal Planet.",2007
3,"Steve Carell better watch out--if he takes many more scripts like this he'll start overexposing himself as that guy in terrible movies just when his career should be skyrocketing. This film is one more symptom of Will Ferrell-itis. Just say no, Steve! My wife disliked this movie because she said the religiousness necessarily behind the concept was a little too over-the-top and in-your-face for her. I personally think the movie does its best to keep from alienating people whose belief in biblical events like those portrayed here is minimal at best, even making fun of Congress' lack of faith, but it's almost as if the movie tries so hard to avoid this problem that it pours on the ""love your family"" sap with so much thickness that the audience just can't get unstuck or see beyond it.",2007
4,"In ""Evan Almighty,"" God turns out to be a celestial one-trick-pony (or should that be a PAIR of one-trick-ponies?).",2007
4,"While not a huge fan of the original ""Bruce Almighty,"" the Jim Carrey comedy from 2004, I now look back fondly upon it as a sweet respite; especially in light of its follow-up, ""Evan Almighty,"" starring Steve Carell and Morgan Freeman.",2007
7,"When Bruce Almighty was released to the public in 2003, I really laughed it out. The general idea of seeing Jim Carrey becoming God was really enjoyable to watch.",2015
3,"Evan Baxter is a new elected congress man. His motto ""Change the world"". After praying to God to help him achieve that Evan finds himself as a new Noah, asked by God to built an Ark. Of course that comes with extra special behavior. The film is not as good as the previous success "" Bruce Almighty"" but it has it's good moments. Nice environmental messages, great performances by Carell and Freeman, funny lines and enjoyable story. The graphics were nice and realistic too. However, in the end, it still felt like a medium standards movie. The story seemed like being rushed at the beginning, the ending was predictable, with some twists though, to be fair. Maybe its the comperiment with the other film, but Evan Almighty wasn't as good as I was expected it to be. So 3 out of 10.",2014
7,I went to see this film on my birthday with my friend Paul. There were low expectations from both of us and we came out pleasantly surprised. We were laughing throughout the movie and it turned out to be a good birthday for me.,2007
8,This movie is very underrated. The verbal insults thrown back & forth by the characters and the subtle and not-so-subtle behavior is just plain hilarious.,2008
8,"All the people that thought that this movie was crude, distasteful and horrid, You have no sense of humor whatsoever. I could not stop laughing throughout this movie. Norbit is a great comedy and it shows what a versatile actor Eddie Murphy is. I don't know why people think this movie is "" Crude"" or ""Racist"" . This is just reality. This is really how the media and the people in this world view these types of people. If it was racist against African Americans, I don't think am African American actor ( Eddie Murphy) and all the others would have agreed to make this movie. All you haters need to rethink your idea of comedy because this is comedic genius.",2008
8,"Wow, I don't no why this movie has received such low ratings! Okay, I understand that there really is no point to the movie. No climax, unforgettable conclusion, I understand. BUT IT WAS FUNNY! Lol, if you ever want to see a movie just to LAUGH, then you have to see Norbit. Eddie Murphy is Brilliant as usual and the characters he plays are pricelesss. I sure did ecjoy watching this hysterical movie. I highly recommend this movie to all ages! HAHHAHAHAHAHAHA, im laughing now thats how funny this movie was. WOW. But anywhoo,like i said before, if you want to watch a movie, not worry about anything else, then Norbit is a must see. LOl, I loved it and believe me, you won't regret it!",2007
8,"This movie was very funny!!!! Why are people making such a big deal about this movie being ""racist and making fun of overweight people""? People who think that need to lighten up and get a sense of humor! If you wanna see this movie because the previews look funny, go and see it. Don't listen to the other people because the movie is like 10 times funnier than the previews! This is definitely one a Eddie Murphy's best movies! I promise that you will think that this movie is funny. Yes, it does have a few racist shots, but if you have a sense of humor you won't mind. And yes, this movie is about an overweight woman, but once again, LIGHTEN UP PEOPLE! Have a good time and laugh at yourself!",2007
7,"I'm going to be completely honest. Some people really need to get whatever is up their behind, out. This films intended purpose was to make you poo yourself, not admire the storyline and embrace the true meaning. Racism is an unavoidable thing with today's society and if you bitches are going to sit here and tell me that it isn't funny (at times) then in all honesty, jump off a bridge. The obesity jokes were, just like the majority of the racist jokes, hilarious. I actually had tears coming down my face at times. And Eddie Murphy is, in my gorgeous eyes, a brilliant actor. So please, STFU. I will admit, it wasn't a perfect film. Some aspects of it were poorly executed hence the 7/10. But overall, I certainly don't think it deserves the 1's, 2's and 3's other reviewers are giving it.",2012
9,"When i read the critics reviews i concluded that there is a big difference in humor between countries. I and my girlfriend and son found this a great humoristic movie, and we watched it several times. I could even be one of Eddys best movies...",2011
7,"I used to be a great admirer of Eddie Murphy films until he went family movie on me. All his recent movies were over the top boring and trying to be cute films. I gave it a high rating in comparison to other Murphy films he has done recently (excluding Dream girls of-course). It has been a while since I last saw Murphy up to his usual antics and I don't much appreciate the fact many are willing to watch offensive black comedy shows such as the Chappelle show (you cannot seriously tell me that show is devoid of any racial/ offensive humor, not with a straight face at lest) but are ready to drop a movie that incorporates the same style (it had most of the familiar cast from Chappelle show too). As i stands this was one of the most genuinely funny movie and just because a film cracks fat jokes and mild racial remarks (which is a base trademark of black humor). I mean we are ready to watch toilet crap such as Mr. Deeds and other overly childish and brain dead level of Adam Sandler movies (Mr. Deeds, Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo to name a few). This movie is certainly not an excellent movie but in terms of Eddie Murphy's current stream of movies this is a much welcomed addition. It reminded me of Bowfinger mixed with Nutty Professor which was pretty humorous. It is stupid yes I will grant it that but its lot more watchable than the toilet flushed material we seem to be watching everyday of our lives like Adam Sandlers antics (Bill Madison ugh...) that is even lesser challenging to a mentally handicapped person. People need to lighten up about looks appearances as well. I am definitely on the heavy side and I find the movie mildly entertaining. If you really want to make issue about racism to its extreme how about using something like Borat.",2007
6,"This is NOT meant to be a serious movie. Those who created Norbit did not set out to make a witty, comical masterpiece that made the viewers think and contemplate...this is a comedy. No one seems to understand it, be the long, winding and rather dull critical remarks on the movie bringing 'a new meaning to distasteful' or something equally as yawn-worthy, what needs to be realized is that this is riddled with clichés and fun, comical satire. This is not meant to make one think, it exists because it must have been entertaining to make and it is funny. This is no Little Miss Sunshine, and it serves its purpose, I spent one hour and forty-two minutes without a decent thought in my head. Those humorless people who continue to bore us with their in depth reasoning for 'why this movie isn't good' need to stop for a second and look at the plot and concept...this is not meant to be taken seriously.",2007
7,"Although it wasn't the absolute funniest movie I've ever seen, Norbit turned out to be a fun filled movie with lots of big names appearing throughout the flick.",2007
7,I'm not sure how to put this... I've seen this movie maybe 4 or 5 times and it never gets old for me. Sure its certainly not politically correct but the timing and Eddie Murphy's numerous outstanding performances are just amazing. Probably some of his best performances ever.,2009
8,"well, all i will say is I laughed and laughed and laughed (a lot!!) don't expect Shakespeare - expect pure silliness; and yes, it is VERY unpolitically correct - full of ""fat"" jokes; but it is a FUNNY FILM!! Mr. Wong is probably my favourite character - this is Eddie Murphy at his best.",2009
10,"This movie is so funny, it is ridiculous. I nearly busted a gut laughing. You people are oversensitive. Yeah, I know it shouldn't get a 10, but compared to any other comedy in the past few years it is right up there. I think you are forgetting that comedies don't have to be outstandingly clever in order to be funny. It isn't meant to be an epic tale with deep metaphors and tons of symbolism, it is meant to be funny, and it succeeds. Forget about mise en scene and just relax and laugh your ass off.",2007
8,"Before I was convinced to spend my money going to see Norbit I was not at all thrilled with the idea of seeing another black man play a big fat black woman. Just so you know I put in the black because with it comes the black stereotypes typical of this kind of movie. The joke has been done and redone and I just couldn't see how they could make it original and funny. Eddie Murphy was a hoot from start to finish in this movie. I was, as well as everyone in the theater busting a gut seeing Eddie play Rasputia, Norbit and the Chinaman Mr. Wong. Even though I still feel it had all been done before Eddie Murphy did achieve making a fresh and very funny approach to it. I'm glad I was talked into parting with my bucks to see Norbit. Eddie Murphy should be proud of this fine comic performance that will thrill his fans. The love story is sweet so take your sweetie to see this one.",2007
9,"Eddie Murphy has put out the best movie of 2007(as of yet anyways). was a bit leery of going to see Norbit, but glad i did now. While seeing trailers in the theater i envisioned another meet the Klumps but Eddie solidified this movie by casting some great supporting roles, ala terry crew(longest yard, click) Cuba Gooding Jr(for once not playing a sweet and innocent character), Kat Williams, Eddie Griffen(undercover brother). Im sure I'm forgetting some but these supporting roles help solidify Norbit. Norbit not only has a good cast of black actors, but the story line is Definitely Original and funny. Norbit had me laughing so loud that i actually missed some lines in the movie. Eddie's character Mr.Wong steals the show, just wish there was a little more from Charlie Murphy. Don't know many actors that can pull off multiple characters in one movie, that is definitely Eddies talent.",2007

10,or the political correct faction in this country. This movie is not Big Momma's House....it is actually funny.,2007
1,"Walking into the movie one must admit they aren't expecting the same comedic genius as a Mel Brook's film, but perhaps that was the main draw of ""Norbit"" in the first place. Personally, I walked in expecting a ridiculously vile and obscenely immature show of comedy. I walked away seeing a lackluster prequel to Dr. Dolittle and The Nutty Proffesor combined. It would be honestly hard to say anything in this film is worth seeing, aside from the few momentary chuckles provided by Eddie Griffin and Katt Williams as stereotypical pimps (a consistently typecast role both have fallen into).",2007
7,"I just got back from seeing this movie, before I went I looked at the user reviews on here. They didn't look too good their was a lot of bad comments about the movie I saw from viewers. But I was very surprised I thought that the movie was great. It was really funny, it had a good storyline, and great acting by all of the cast members. But their was one thing that I did not like too much, I think that it kind of picked on obese people a little bit too much. But besides that the movie was pretty good. It made me laugh and the others in the theater seemed to like it also, I give the movie 7/10 because it was well worth the money of seeing it in the theaters.",2007
8,"I don't understand why people find this movie so horrible. It is actually a great movie with great acting by Eddie Murphy. His accents are hilarious, and the way he made Norbit such a likable character. I went with some friends to go see the movie after seeing the horrible Epic Movie and it was a great turnaround. Me, my friends, and even the girls thought it was hilarious. The whole theater couldn't stop laughing at every joke put out there. This is also a great comedy romance. You will easily like this movie if you like stupid movies, but you will also like this movie if you like just a regular comedy. Just don't expect a relaxing romantic movie, Norbit is nothing of the sort. The only thing wrong with this movie is that the advertising people for this movie did a pretty bad job of showing the movie's true comedy. Definitely see this movie. It's like they always say,""don't judge a book by its cover"".",2007
3,"This is a rather uneven comedy but it definitely has its funny moments. ""How You Doin?"" was Rasputia's (Norbit's dreadful, fat, psychotic wife) signature line throughout the movie. The movie really stretched the limits of believability because there was really no reason for Norbit to marry such a grotesque bully (except the possibility that he was afraid to say no).",2007
7,"I'm going to be honest and direct..............If you liked Eddie Murphy in Coming to America playing various roles, then Norbit is for you. I was highly entertained with humor, at some points brought to tears. Eddies' diverse comedy playing different roles in a film is simply hilarious! Go see for yourself. If you go to this film with the mindset that you want to laugh and aren't looking for a flawless detailed movie, continue your journey to a theater near you! Im my personal opinion, Murphy as Mr. Wong is a show stealer!!! Reminds me of his white barbershop character in Coming to America. I consider Norbit a blend of coming to America, mixed with some Friday and sprinkled with some in living color.",2007
1,"I was so excited to see Norbit, from the trailer, this actually looked like a very funny movie. When I saw the rating on IMDb, I thought maybe there was a chance people just took the movie too seriously, I wanted to check it out for myself. I don't mind fat jokes here and there, I liked the movie Shallow Hal, I also used to be heavy and lost all the weight, so I know what it's like to feel isolated in a society that praises thin people. But I never took it personally, I make fat jokes still for fun. But Norbit took it not only to a very racist level, but to a level where it makes it look like big people are hideous and mean monsters and that it's alright to ridicule them. The funny thing is, I wasn't intending on taking this movie seriously, until I saw it and did not laugh once.",2007
2,"After viewing Perfect Stranger, I went on the film's page at the IMDb, and found out that there were three different endings filmed, each one with a different character being guilty. This does not surprise me at all. This is a movie that jerks us around simply for the sole fact that it wants to jerk us around. It doesn't want us to figure it out, and it doesn't play fair. When I realized that there was no point in following the clues and the movie simply plays to the demands of the filmmaker and which ending worked best with test audiences, it made me hate this shallow and silly excuse for a thriller even more.",2007
6,"""Perfect Stranger"" is quite thrilling but the finale simply absurd, moronic. It doesn't lack thrills and pshycology, being it a phsycological thriller. Played intensely, with moments of entertainment not delicious but decent though, everything's spoiled by the foolish and outrageous ending - the mystery resolution is too convoluted. It looks like a pre-packedged thriller, ""homogenized"" I'd say, with much part of it taking place in chats. Bruce Willis and Halle Berry have acted much better in past, but are watchable regardless, as well as Giovanni Ribisi; suspense thriller is made bearable but eventually degenerates..",2007
2,"I watched Perfect Stranger at a preview at my local theater this past weekend, and next to the scantily clad Halle Berry, there was no reason to go watch this movie. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with movies with twists, but as long as they're done with thought, taste, and creativity. The problem in this movie is writers have all the freedom in the world to guide a viewer's mind and place where the twists lie. It is too easy for writers to trick the audience, and to some audience members, the simple trick in itself is good enough to make the movie ""great."" Well, this doesn't cut it for me. I want a movie that connects, makes me think, has me connect with a character, or even teaches me something. Perfect Stranger lacked meaning, taste, and creativity and is just another one of those ""movies with a twist."" FYI: The movie was a long advertisement with way too much product placement.

3,"What in the world has happened to Halle Berry? Can't she act any more? Judging from this movie I'd say: Yes - she can't... And Bruce Willis is ... well, he's Bruce Willis. And why does she have to participate in a mediocre thriller like this one? Because it is very mediocre. The beginning is quite promising, and I was ready for a nice, clean thriller. But what followed was like a bad version of some Michael Crichton novel. Oh, and the filmmakers filmed three different endings to the film, each with a different character as the killer? Then they must have chosen the worst ending. The film is not creative, not inventive, implausible, sometimes ridiculous. No, it's not a disaster. But a major disappointment.",2007
8,"I've read all the negative comments and I'm starting to think someone who hates Halle Berry has created multiple accounts. I hadn't intended on seeing it, I just felt like going to the movies this afternoon. The movie I wanted to see didn't start until later so I said 'what the heck, I'll give it a try'. This movie was a pleasant surprise for me.",2007
7,"I think the relentless attacks on this movie particularly by critics are just totally unfair. Reviews are running about 10-1 against it in some major publications. It is frequently referred to as ""conventional"" or clichéd. In the first place, they criticize it for pandering to public interest because it is partially about computer sex, and also about a congressman who has illicit affairs with boys, and an investigative reporter who tries to find the lowdown on a powerful ad executive who is cheating on his wife. The Congressman/boy scandal actually happened last year in Washington,D.C. In many movies nowadays computers and cell phones play a role (""The Departed"" for example) and at least two recent highly-praised movies (""Me And You and Everyone We Know"" and ""Hard Candy"") are specifically about computer sex. Sex always sells (there are numerous sexual references as well in ""Blades Of Glory"", but this is just Will Ferrell showing his Saturday Night Live! background, it is funny, and to a large extent ""Blades"" rises above this) and to criticize ""Perfect Stranger"" for being sleazy for this reason is hardly fair. Then they criticize the acting performances. I think Halle Berry should be allowed to do her thing. With this movie, she should become an even bigger box office draw. ",2007
5,"Perfect Stranger I had read really bad reviews of the movie on the internet and I was not sure whether I should go to see this movie or not. I had to choose between a 1918 Austrian silent movie and this. I chose this, just because it was a new movie.",2007
3,"The only reason i can see for this movie to be released is because celebrities are in it. But, Halle Berry over-acts a choppy and shallowly developed character. I spent the whole movie waiting for the plot to really get going, but instead what i got was a whole bunch of disconnected plot points and irrelevant characters. It is supposed to be suspenseful, but mostly i just wanted it to be over. When the end came, yes, it was a surprise, but by that time I did not care about the story at all. And it was only ""surprising"" because the whole story is random events all loosely, very loosely connected to the end. It was almost...amateur. The story does not give enough background on most characters to evoke sympathy, emotion, or interest...ESPECIALLY Willis' character. It's a movie that is good in theory, but wasn't focused enough to be held in the same esteem as other psychological thrillers. The most developed and well acted character is really Ribisi's. His performance is noteworthy and enough to warrant the 3 out of 10.",2007
2,"I've never commented movies here but I just had to write a word of warning to anyone who's planning on watching this. The movie is slow, boring, without suspense or tension. The story is lame, nothing new nor original, nor even interesting. One is under the impression that they just threw ideas on paper not bothering to shape them into a coherent story (and I use the term ""idea"" in the broadest possible meaning). Hence all the holes and illogic places in the plot. Sorry guys, but a few close-ups of Halle Berry's ass aren't going to make up for the terrible story. The characters are so underdeveloped that they are not even two-dimensional. Acting is just terrible and even though none of the actors did well, Halle Berry must be singled out as absolutely the worst of them. She just can't act. Even when she forces herself to change facial expression nothing really changes in her acting. She might as well be reading the phone book out loud. Scenes which should be dramatic and emotional are just plain ridiculous. Plus, she's too old for the role she was playing here. Curiously enough, she's not the one wearing the most makeup in this movie. Cue Bruce Willis. He is now running neck to neck with Sylwester Stallone in the ""who's wearing the most makeup"" race. Apart from that, he's just being there doing his thing, being exactly the same as in any other movie he's acted in. One wonders why they even bother to change the name his characters, because he portrays them all in the same way.",2007

5,"This must have been a vehicle designed for Halle Berry, an actress that had her fifteen minutes of fame in ""Monster's Ball"". After all, in that film she had several things going for her, namely, her director, Marc Forster, a meaty role, and Billy Bob Thornton who showed great chemistry with Ms. Berry. Bruce Willis seems to have been an after thought since he doesn't have much to do in this film.",2008

2,"What happened to Halle Berry? A few years back she was the new thing, an actress with an Oscar, done a great supporting role in a Bond movie, had some other pretty credible roles, and starred in the blockbuster X-Men and X-Men 2. And then she went off to star in Catwoman. Why she signed on to star in that loathsome little movie is still beyond me, but she clearly learnt here lesson as she collected her Razzie for the movie in person. But after her little performance in this pathetic little Basic Instinct wannabe I am really not sure whether Halle Berry will ever be able to recover. In all fairness she is the best thing in this movie, she at least does make an effort. But I can't say that for the rest of the movie. I suppose the saddening thing here is that this could have worked, with a better script and with a little effort this movie might be good old dumb fun. Unfortunately instead its a plodding caper without an idea where its going and chucking so many red herrings at us it eventually realises it has none left and leaves us with the only other possible ending.",2007
10,"This movie was outstanding and one of the better movies I have seen in a while. It was a refreshing thriller which kept you guessing until the very end. The acting by everyone in the movie was great. Throughout the entire movie I was trying to figure out if Harrison Hill was the bad guy or if it was Miles or the wife. It was so unexpected that Ro was the killer. The end is what tied the whole movie together and I do not understand why so many people hated this ending. All of the twists kept the movie from never getting boring. I also liked the fact that everyone in the movie had both a kind side and a dark side to their personality. This movie was one of the best this year, so I obviously recommend this movie.",2007
2,"This movie suffers from a weak script and bad performances. Although it holds mild interest in the initial stages, it quickly morphs into a manipulative, formalistic, contrived mess that does nothing to restore my faith in Hollywood. I am always amazed that credible actors like Willis and Berry agree to appear in this kind of stuff. Perhaps they either did not read the script or the almighty dollar caused them to shelve their artistic sense and act in a movie that is destined for the DVD ""Bargain Bin"" at Walmart faster than you can say ""stinker"". Enough said? (FYI, the reason I give it 2 stars is because of Berry's stellar looks (one for the body; one for the face).",2007

This film achieved what others did not- I could not release my girlfriend's hand all over the time, and when the story finished I discovered there was nothing unexplained. A great suspense film I recommend. Belén Rueda, is a completely credible character and the place where the story has been shot helps make it realistic or, at least, the viewer gets into the environment created. The rest of actors are good and Geraldine Chaplin's scene is one of the most creepy I've ever seen",2007
9,"There is something to the marketing of foreign films and the way Hollywood tries its hardest to fool the public into thinking it is an English language movie. By not allowing any characters to speak in the trailers, giving away their secret with subtitles, someone like me, knowing it's foreign, is able to get a glimpse at the style and tone without really learning anything about the plot to ruin my surprise upon sitting in the theatre. This aspect worked perfectly for Guillermo Del Toro's production of El Orfanato. I had very little idea of what I was getting into and this film ended up being the best atmospheric horror I have seen since Alejandro Amenábar's The Others, (I don't count Del Toro's own El Laberinto del fauno because that was more fantasy than anything else). I now ask what it is that all three of these films have in common? With thisJ.A. Bayona's feature debuteach is helmed by a Spanish director. I can't think of a better nation making movies right now; the Spanish are doing everything right and this film just adds to bolstering that argument.",2008

One of those three, Alfonso Cuáron, said in an interview last year that the trio (himself, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu & Guillermo del Toro) considered themselves to be nothing in comparison to ""what is to come"".",2008
5,"I pretty much knew with relative certainty and from beforehand that ""The Orphanage"" wasn't going to be my cup of tea. Slow-brooding ghost stories almost never appeal to me and I didn't even care for producer Guillermo Del Toro's own and critically acclaimed ""The Devil's Backbone"". But, considering the hugely positive internet buzz as well as the endless amount of praising reviews on this website, I  being a devoted horror fanatic  simply couldn't afford to ignore this Spanish instant classic entirely. Well, the only thing I can conclude after seeing the film is that ""The Orphanage"" is exactly what you expect from a relatively soft, mainstream and overall ethically correct modern day horror production; whether it's made in Spain, Japan or elsewhere in the world. Obviously it's an extremely professionally made film, with a handful of memorable style elements and effective jump moments, but in the end it really isn't much more than just another derivative and predictable 'ghosts from the past coming back to haunt us' tale that lack the courage to go very far. Undoubtedly the qualitatively greatest aspect about ""The Orphanage"" is the naturally sinister setting. The events take place in an old and remote orphanage  duh  located near a quiet beach with an inactive lighthouse and a wide network of sinister caves. Laura, who spend her childhood here, returns with her husband and 7-year-old son and intends to re-open the orphanage specifically for orphans with a mental and/or physical handicap. On the day of the opening, however, Laura's own son Simon  who's also adopted and chronically ill  mysteriously disappears without a trace. Months go by without a sign of life and Laura understandably starts to get desperate. Was Simon kidnapped by the uncanny lady who arrived at the orphanage and posed as a social assistant shortly before his disappearance? Or perhaps Laura should have listened more to her son's stories about the invisible friends he made, as they seem to know an awful lot of accurate details about the orphanage's dark past. Somewhat to my anticipated frustration, ""The Orphanage"" contains all the clichés and stereotypes the sub genre of ghost stories has to offer. There's the overly fanatic mother versus the rational father, the eccentric and somewhat flamboyant spiritual medium, the morbid old lady that may or may not be real and of course a wide collection of pity-evoking long dead children whose souls are restless. The young and relatively inexperienced director J.A. Bayona does an impressive job maintaining the macabre ambiance all the way from start to finish, but sadly it isn't enough to qualify as a masterpiece in the genre. There's only just ONE that really made me jump towards the edge for my seat for a little while, namely the second confrontation with the elderly lady in the middle of a busy street. Although this is unquestionably a truly masterful sequence, it's nearly not enough as far as I'm concerned. Many fans glorify the finale, but the whole third act actually just confirmed to me that ""The Orphanage"" rather wanted to be a sentimental melodrama about the true values of family and motherly love. When it comes to (Spanish) ghost stories of the past 10 to 20 years, Amenábar's unique and already classic ""The Others"" is still the norm and ""The Orphanage"" is not likely to change that.",2009
8,"Recent horror films seem more inclined to thrill than to chill. Such hits like ""Dawn of Dead"" and ""I am Legend"" are great movies, but their fear comes from intensity rather than dread. However, there have been a few good chillers out there, such as ""The Others"" and ""The Ring."" And now, ""The Orphanage,"" from acclaimed Spanish producer Guillermo del Toro, creeps its way into their ranks, while still being a genre-defying film.",2008

This film has a different style of mystery, not the same we see in most of the horror/suspense movies in which the overact curiosity of the characters carry to cross the creepy door where are killed in the next shot with the axe or the saw, no..., this time the bad guy isn't the ghost.

8,"Haynes' adventurous biopic of Bob Dylan, which uses six actors of both sexes and several races ranging in ages from 11 to 50, is both exhausting and fun to watch. It's also hard to describe. But let's start with those six and the characters or facets they portray. Arthur (Ben Whishaw) is the Dylan who incarnated Rimbaud and serves as a kind of narrator whom we see smoking and giving ironic answers to some kind of inquisition sporadically throughout the film. Woody (the wonderful young Marcus Carl Franklin, an amazing a singer and actor) is a precocious rail-hopper with a guitar (labeled like the real Woody's, THIS MACHINE KILLS FASCISTS) and tall tales that start with his claim that he's Woody Guthrie. Woody's scenes show him rescued by a black family and a white family and performing with country black musicals. He represents the early shape-shifting Dylan in search of an identity and telling a lot of lies along the way.",2007

9,"This film amazed me. One reason it worked for me is because it's drenched in Dylan's music. I wasn't expecting that. Most of the time, it's Dylan's voice when 'Blind Willie McTell' or 'Moonshiner' or 'Idiot Wind' (the slow, acoustic version) suddenly erupt on the sound track to huge emotional effect. Other times instrumental teasers from 'Man In The Long Black Coat' or 'Nashville Skyline Rag' are planted in the mix like fragments of dreams you can't quite focus on. All the pre-release publicity had revolved around Cate Blanchett is girl Dylan! and Marcus Carl Franklin is African American boy Dylan! but the film itself unfolds like a kaleidoscopic dream where the pieces never quite meet. A bit like me and all my friends scratching our heads in the 1960s and 1970s and earnestly wondering how John Wesley Harding related to Blonde On Blonde, or how Slow Train Coming related to Blood On the Tracks. Well they don't. In ""Chronicles, Volume One"" Dylan dwells on the moment when he stumbled across Rimbaud's declaration ""Je est un autre"" which translates into English: ""I is someone else"". Dylan writes: ""When I read those words the bells went off. It made perfect sense. I wish someone would have mentioned it to me earlier."" That insight has sustained Dylan thru all his multiple personalities, finger pointing folkie, rock & roll rebel, Nashville good ol' boy (Oh me oh my, love that country pie), tormented lover, Born Again Christian. When he performed on his first album, aged 21, he was trying to summon up the voice of a 60 year old blues singer. ",2007

10,"I just saw I'm Not There at the Telluride Film Festival. It is AMAZING. The performances are nothing short of spectacular. Cate Blanchett really nails the role except that her voice obviously can't hit the same bass as the real Bob Dylan. She does, however, look creepily like Dylan in many instances and really gets the mannerisms right. Christian Bale is another standout. It should be mentioned that all of the performances are really top-notch, nobody falls short. The music was fantastic, too (obviously). My one complaint would be that the film goes on a bit longer than it probably needs to but not enough to affect my overall score. I floated out of the theater after seeing this one. It is definitely essential for all Dylan fans. Many of the people I saw the film with were not very familiar with Dylan's life or music but they said they enjoyed it as well.

7,"This film honestly could not have come sooner. Now that the world has ""Dewey Cox"", the idea of the biopic as cliché (think about it, do artists lives ALWAYS follow that particular narrative arc?) has garnered its own momentum to literally standardize public figures lives into similar profiles. This movie evades and destroys this effect completely by throwing out veracity and accepting all of Bob Dylan's idiosyncratic messages, identities, stories, themes, and creative drives at face value, no matter how contradictory they may seem. The result is a movie that is possibly the ""truest"" version of an artist's life: one that just says everything he does to represent himself is right, and builds up a much more interesting character than a single identity.",2008

3,"It would be far too simplistic to say that there's an 85 min film starring Cate Blanchett trying to fight its way out of this. I mean, I rather like Haynes' basic conceit of having a dovetailed selection of fictionalised biopic. At one end is the immature, unselfconscious Marcus Carl Franklin as a Woody Guthrielyte; at the other Richard Gere as a schizophrenic samurai of civil rights. In between are conventional characterisations of Bob Dylan from Christian Bale (Julianne Moore entirely acceptable as a Baez-a-like) and an extraordinary cinematic cloning from Cate Blanchett. Heath Ledger's actor and Ben Whishaw's poet-abstraction are less well incorporated into the film's fabric.",2008
8,"Take all the music, everything you've heard, read, seen in documentaries about Bob and throw them in a blender and pull them out and what you get is ""I'm not there"" And it's a tasty concoction of a movie that comes off like a dream of everything that's publicly known about his life. Perhaps even Bob himself dreaming about the course of his life. The more you do know about what's out there about Bob the more you'll be able to make the connections with the scenes in this beautiful montage about the poet, songwriter, and musician genius of the last 60 plus years. This is a great film about a very complicated artist who could never be pinned down as representing any one ideology or persona although he seemed to imply many. I suppose Dylan will always be the great enigma and this film only helps to perpetuate it, which is part of what makes it so successful but as we all now know there's no success like failure and failure's no success at all.",2007
7,"I saw this yesterday at my local art-house cinema, with my grandparents who were young when Bob Dylan was 'big' (is my lack of knowledge about Dylan already showing? Oh dear), and I have to say, I'm glad I was there - even if Bob Dylan wasn't.",2008
1,"Before I saw this movie, I didn't know very much about Bob Dylan. By watching this I was hoping to gain some insight into his life and his beloved songwriting. After viewing the movie I walked away more confused than I did coming in. For an artist that wrote and performed songs relating to the working class American, it seems strange that a pretentious art-house angle would be used to portray his life. He came across as a cold, bitter individual. The meandering and unfocused direction of the movie seemed to have been made by an amateur college student with no sense of breathing life into it's subject. It's a shame that the talent of Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Richard Gere and others were wasted. Perhaps I will gain a strong appreciation of Dylan, but I didn't from watching this.",2008
10,"Todd Haynes' I'm Not There is a genuinely visionary work of art; ostensibly a biopic of Bob Dylan, Haynes has actually made seven different short movies, each with its own precise cinematic language, which have then been carefully interwoven to create a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. ",2007
10,"I just returned from viewing this film at the New York film festival, and I must say it potentially Haynes' best film to date. By abstracting from a conventional biopic, the film captures the essence of Dylan. The different actors that play Dylan chronicle the metamorphosis of an icon. With an astounding ensemble the performances are flawless. Cate Blanchett in particular, is uncanny as Dylan at the peak of his stardom, in all likelihood securing a Supporting Actress Oscar nomination. Technically the editing is seamless and Haynes is successfully able to integrate a multitude of styles. In emulating Dylan, the film itself is structured much like a poem. Haynes strings together fact and fiction, the real and surreal and the self and society into a magnificent fabric that illustrates the identity of one of the greatest American icons.",2007

1,"In-spite of the soundtrack, this movie resembled the kind of trite one would be expecting coming out a high school film club. The movie follows several stories, each one either a version or image of the artist. Unfortunately, none of these are entertaining or interesting. Though the whole story should be relatively easy enough even for the non Dylan fan if at a point you feel a bit lost just pause and remember this: Don't worry, you didn't miss anything, there wasn't anything there to begin with.",2008
1,Truly a waste of time.,2007
6,"To appreciate I’m Not There., you need to fully buy into its somewhat-implausible premise; in it, six actors represent various aspects of Bob Dylan throughout his many decades in the limelight. If you buy into this premise, then this is a unique, thoughtful perspective of an almost-unknowable individual, a man who famously played things close to the vest, a man who shunned introspection. But if you don’t immediately buy into this premise, then the movie just feels like a long experiment that isn’t entirely successful, and in the end you don’t feel you know much more about the man, the myth, the legend than you knew going in. Which might be the point, who’s to say? And that’s sort of where I land on the whole I’m Not There. issue.",2008
10,"To me, this show is bliss. I watched both of the first two episodes aired and am already in love. The genius lies in the delivery. The seriousness of which Bret and Jermaine approach the situation adds a certain amount of wit to every comment made. Pay close attention and the slightest musical references are made, such as Fleetwood Mac's ""love square"". It is the subtlety of the comedy that makes this show stand out above the rest.",2007
10,"I guess the general rule is that in any 1st season of a comedy there are going to be highs and lows. However this could be the exception to the rule. It was brilliant from start to finish. Anyone lucky enough to listen to the Conchords radio series in the UK or to have seen their HBO one night stand slot will not be disappointed. The humor is subtle and at times could be likened to the UK version of the office with Rhys Darby in the David Brent role (band manager Murray). Bret and Jermain satisfy audiences with their witty repertoire of songs and inane banter, all while the world around them seems to make less and less sense. Superb. A must see.",2008
10,"Words truly can't express the way I feel about Flight of the Conchords. My younger brother showed me a clip of their song ""Business Time"" performed live and ever since I've been hooked. The show itself is truly hilarious, but what really makes it a true 10/10 is the music. With songs like Business Time, Robots, Beautiful Girl, Bowie, Leggy Blonde and many more this show will make you cry tears of joy. Not only are the duo of the band brilliant but they also have comedians Rhys Darby as their hilariously pathetic band manager Murray and Arj Barker as their friend and local pawn shop guy to teach them how things work in America.",2008
10,"This show has all the elements of a great comedy. The supporting cast is consistently hilarious; just view episode 10 and listen to Murray's commentary on rock and roll and threesomes. Mel is another gem of a character who has a husband but lives and breaths the FOTC band. Arj always has some sort of admonition and advice for these unsuspecting guys and it makes for a hilarious misconstrued view. I love how the writers take an idea and spin it in the other direction, such as the episode where the woman objectifies the man. I consistently laugh at what wild and crazy situation these guys will get into next. I hope they continue this show another season! oneG",2007
10,"What more can you ask for? It's funny, it's silly, it has characters that you love and musical numbers that really work. The simple storyline of two New Zealand musicians trying to make it in the Big Apple puts to shame other comedies that try so hard whereas Flight of the Conchords just seems so effortless. Murray their manager who is trying to treat the whole ""band"" experience"" as though they were much larger in scope than just the three of them with almost non existent gigs is hilarious. Their one fan, Mel, is a wide-eyed, curly haired, stalker who conveniently runs into the guys everywhere. Never has stalking been this much fun. Not since Da Ali G. show has an HBO comedy been this enjoyable. Long life to the Flight of the Conchords. A hit if I've ever seen one. I LOVE YOU BRET (Brit)!",2007
10,"The subtle sense of laughter this show has is quite exceptional. Watching it, you never get the sense of bursting into hard laughs, yet you are not bored; during the length of the entire show, there is only one expression on your face, a wide smile. you get the feeling of extreme mellowness with a dash of cool, plus that New Zealand accent for garnish, and you got your self a recipe for, in my opinion, one of the best original comedies you'll ever see. But I also must note that with a fresh comedy like, you've got to have a sense of patience, since the mellowness of the show gives it a kind of slow motion to the events that occur. Finally the greatest part, and most funny, is the music. between scenes the Conchords sing a song that relates to the events occurring during the episode, and each song is just more hilarious than the one that preceded it, thus keeping that smile on your face.",2007

9,"Smart writing! Not for the commercial masses. Well written and acted out characters. Original music throughout the program which is creative and innovative. Throughout the show the main actors perform out songs related to the episode that brings an unique style of directing. I really enjoyed Flight of the Conchords and looking forward to Season 2. The Band Meeting scenes are one the things that I enjoy about the show. Like I said though, not for the masses but a show that is very overlooked and very much not appreciated. A different brand of comedy and a very original series. Looking forward to buying the DVD of Season 1. Going in the collection!",2007
8,"These guys really impressed me. They are excellent song writers, styling themselves after David Bowie, REM, and various genres they explored, and succeed in writing a legitimate, structured songs. They have a knack for creating a catchy song, and make it silly without compensating their shtick, or going overboard. They really take themselves seriously as musicians. And thats only 1/3 of reasons to check this show out.",2008
8,"This show stars two characters Bret, and Jermaine who have traveled from New Zealand to New York City in order to make their band ""Flight of the Conchords"" the next big thing. They are managed by a fellow New Zealander Murray, who really works for the NZ consulate in the US, but runs the band on the side, constantly failing to get them ""gigs"". Through interactions with Americans who almost always confuse them with Brits, an obsessed fan who is constantly stalking them, a buddy with a paintball gun, and a girlfriend who likes guys who are in a band, this show has some seriously funny moments. This show is full of humor that might make you think a little bit, but at the same time, you're hit with an occasional comment that makes you laugh, not laugh out loud, but you're just like haha, that was pretty funny. If you're a fan of Laugh out loud comedy where the jokes don't make you think a little bit, then stay away. This show isn't complex by any means, but it attempts to give you a subtle humor that some run away from. This show isn't the greatest thing to ever hit television, but if you're looking for a solid 30 minutes of entertainment, then tune in. I give it a very above average 8 out of 10, because it never fails to make you laugh, but at the same time, it's not the greatest show ever made.",2007
10,I love them because they don't try to be something they're not.,2008
10,"I think this is the funniest sit-com I have ever watched. It makes me laugh out loud more than anything else I have ever seen. Why is a rambling conversation about buying a cup, or Simon and Garfunkel tribute acts, so funny? The writing is perfect and the acting is perfect. I do not know how these guys keep a straight face - not just Jemaine, Bret, and Murray, but the understated support cast too. The idea of a musical sit-com sounds horrendous - but not only are the songs very very funny but they are actually good songs too. Production quality very high. Consistently ingenious, pure joy. It also makes me want to go to New Zealand.",2015
10,"Why oh why did they stop after two seasons? This show is absolutely fabulous. Normally I hate about every movie or series where they start to sing in but this show is the exception. The musicians are brilliant, the variety of genres, the lyrics are so funny you can't get enough of it. I started singing their songs after every episode. And then that same kind of repetitive humor through the whole show. I thought it was one of the funniest show I saw the last years. Jemaine and Bret are hilarious, Murray their manager that comes up with the stupidest ideas, and Mel their number one fan and also only fan... It's all a cocktail for a brilliant show. Too sad that this show ended. A proof that New-Zealand can deliver when it's about comedy...",2015
10,This is one of the best shows I've ever seen and it truly is one of the funniest. Jemaine and Bret are one of the best comedy duos since Laurel and Hardy. The humor is dry and perfect. ,2008
9,"'Flight of the Conchords' tells the story of a couple of musicians from New Zealand trying to make it in a band in New York. They're not very good, they have no girlfriends, one fan and an incompetent manager (Rhys Darby, who steals most of the scenes he's in), and everybody just loves their English accents. The series' twelve episodes follow their failures. So what's so great? Partly its the absolutely deadpan way in which the undynamic duo's misadventures are depicted; but mainly its the songs, which are brilliantly bad, pastiches of real musical styles but hilariously funny (although the songs feature mainly in ""music videos"" or in scenes which blend the characters' imaginations with real life; on the rare occasions the band actually gets a gig, their act consists of an anaemic chant of ""we like to rock the party"" over a badly strummed guitar - there is a reason for the band's lack of success!). In some ways, this is 'Spinal Tap', but with more musical variety; and the funniest program of the year.",2007

9,But it certainly is for me. Flight of the Conchords is all about the quick & subtle comedy & hardly gets in your face (aside from the musical interludes of extreme greatness).,2008
8,"I started watching this show this past summer at my buddies house once a week as a get together of old friends. At first the conversation was less about the TV show but more about what was going on with us. Sooner or later though we started paying attention to the show and how funny it actually is. The style of the show is a very dry humor similar to Monty python with its play on words and how you have to pick up on certain things and jokes. Every time I watch the show now I pick up on things I missed the previous times. It is a different styled show because at anytime it will break into a song. Usually the song is funny, I will admit though that some are misses. But this is one of those shows that you watch with your friends or other fans of the show and quote to one another. I think its a very good show and I can't wait for the next season to start up again because it definitely one of the most original shows on TV in a while.",2008
10,"the subtle humor of this show is just so great. i also love the music. yes, our innermost thoughts are expressed in song, like when Jermaine writes a song for Brett and gets all graphic about his love for him and then Brett says he went a little over the top and Jermaine says ""that wasn't in there."" Also the dream Brett has where Jermaine is David Bowie. and how Murray always has to take roll at each meeting, including calling his own name. ""Murray? Present."" I think the key to the humor also is that they are so naive to the world of the US and they are learning every day. Oh, and when Jermaine tries to cheer Brett up by doing the talking stove. ""You love the talking stove, Britt!"" Hilarious. I thought I had a pretty strange sense of humor, but now I am sure of it! I actually didn't catch the show when it was on but I watched all the episodes on demand and now I am in withdrawal! Come back guys!",2007
10,"This is one of those shows in which it is difficult to explain why you love it so much, but you do. There is definitely a charming simplicity to the show, not to mention that it is wonderfully written and acted. Bret and Jemaine are so brilliant yet naive in their roles. It's impossible not to love them as they struggle to make their way as a band in America. I'm not going to lie, the first few episodes won't pull you in quite as well as some other shows have; however, some of my favorite shows need to grow on you. For example, Mad Men and Breaking Bad are two of my favorite shows ever made and I can't say I was captivated after a few episodes. It would be a crime to say I don't hold Flight of the Conchords in a similar regard. The musical pieces are memorable and hilarious and the show was ended far too soon. Definitely one to buy.",2012
10,I'm one of those people who was told years ago about this show but just put it on the back burner and forgot about it. I finally got around to watching the DVDs that were given to me and I think these guys are brilliant.,2012
9,"I love this show. The dry comedy and funny songs were strange to me at first, but over time I grew to truly love this show. These guys are hilarious, the show was off-beat and in a sort of indy style. each episode had the aesthetic of an art film, but far more humor.",2011
10,"A comedy Musical , i only watched this as i was keen to see whatever happened to The Eagle from eagle V shark (an excellent movie - watch if you haven't). True natural comedy, witty in the fact these people seem to be 'real' people. Playing a role of people who think they are better at what they do than they actually are and not as intelligent as the average sole. Two Musicians that never play gigs , they are managed by a guy that seems to have no idea what a manager is, a band wit 1 fan or is she a stalker. If you like Napolean Dynamite then you'll enjoy this. Even the lyrics to the songs are superb. Hopefully this show will last a few series and will win many awards it deserves.",2009
9,"This is one of my absolute favorite shows. I first started out liking the band and their music, having no idea that they had a show. Then, I started watching the show and ended up liking it even more than the songs. The show is very calm and slow-paced, despite being set in New York City. Bret and Jemaine (that's how their names are spelled) are two struggling (and I'm putting as much emphasis on the word) musicians trying to become famous. Throughout the two seasons, they encounter many strange people, including a Simon and Garfunkel-obsessed sex addict and even a racist fruit vendor. One of the funniest characters on this show has to be Murray Hewitt, the band's manager. Bret and Jemaine are very good musicians and their songs often coincide with the situation before they are played. A must-watch for any comedy and/or music fan. Nine out of ten.",2016

2,"Well, I guess I should have known going into this one that it was going to have absolutely no plot. The whole film is based on some notion of family honor. Basically Nicolas Cage was so sick of being considered a wacko for all those years that the second anyone tried to trash his name he was up for a fight. Is this not the biggest crock? I mean, it's based on the premise, that if your distant relatives did bad things you should: A) Feel extremely bad for said acts even though you had nothing to do with them. B) Give extreme credit and worry to those who would look down on you for this and C) Risk life and limb and also endanger the lives of others to clear your dead relatives of said bad accusations. What an awful justification for all of his acts! I think there are many many people in this country that have relatives whom have engaged in horrible things (i.e. slavery, extermination of Native Americans, etc..)

Not much of details as you would expect out of a great movie, not much of substance in the movie itself however the acting and the pace of the movie is so beautiful you wont think of the flaws in the intricate plans they carry out in the movie. The subtle comedy is really nice and they have kept the first movie in consideration and have not brought many new characters. It is not a movie that you would think a lot about after you come out of the hall, however you will not think anything else either while the movie is going on. I will give it 7 for the sheer value of entertainment and nothing else and of course the one liners that keep popping up which actually make you laugh.",2007

2,"This movie was pathetic. I'm glad I only used my Christmas gift cards to see it and not my own money. Let me set the stage for you: The theater was pretty packed for a New Year's day 8:00 p.m. showing. The audience was in a good mood to start. I could feel the energy with the laughter coming from the Goofy cartoon that preceded this dreck of a film. The group synergy was great and it lasted until about half-way through the film. Once we all realized what a complete waste of time and money this movie was, we immediately stopped laughing at Justin Bartha's quips and started laughing at Diane Kruger's acting... which was far more humorous. Seriously, the only thing she was good for was that scene in the oval office where she was wearing that skimpy little dress. The movie was full of lousy punch-lines delivered by an even lousier combined effort from some A-list actors. Based on the first National Treasure movie, I didn't expect this to be a masterpiece in cinematic eloquence, but I did expect the likes of Voight, Mirren, Keitel and Harris to give a little more than this. Harris' performance was particularly awful mainly because of the complexity of the way his character was written. First, he's a shrewd southern business man who wants nothing more than to find this city of gold. Then, he turns into somewhat of a hero and sacrifices himself. WTF?!? Then he says ""All I wanted to do was find the city and help you to clear your name."" That's ALL HE WANTED?!? Again, WTF?!? This coming from the same character who said no more than two scenes prior ""Well, if I'm not going last then I might as well go first,"" when it came to a perilous situation. Uhhh, ookkaaayyyy. Mirren's performance wasn't all that bad. Her character was poorly introduced and her first scene when arguing with Voight's character was pretty hard to swallow. Keitel's performance was okay as well, but I think that is only because he didn't have enough time on screen for the writers to screw it up too. Honestly, the movie as a whole was not worth the time. It was so far fetched that it really just became incredibly unbelievable in every way. Government agencies infiltrated at the ease of entering a Wal-Mart, International government Web sites hacked like they were a link from Google. The Secret Service as inept as a group of security guards at a Foghat concert. This was just lame. Poorly written, poorly acted and a poor choice on my behalf. Should've known better.",2008

3,"The first ""National Treasure"" (2004) movie qualified as a predictable potboiler that was fast, furious, frivolous fun. The sequel ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" is just plain frivolous. Nicolas Cage heads up a seasoned cast, including Jon Voight, Ed Harris, Helen Mirren, Bruce Greenwood, and Harvey Keitel, that looks like they had a blast. If watching other folks have a heck of a lot of fun on the big-screen turns you on, then ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" will delight you. Unfortunately, ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" lacks virtually everything that good action-adventure movies boast. You won't find many suspenseful scenes that are realistic enough to make you squirm at the edge of your seat. Everything here resembles a carefully contrived amusement park thrill ride. When all is said and done, the heroes, villains, and sidekicks engage in an endless game of musical chairs. In fact, the entire movie looks like an episode taken from producer Jerry Bruckheimer's CBS-TV series ""The Amazing Race."" Basically, the principals scramble breathlessly across Europe, on a harebrained scavenger hunt for clues that bring them into contact with several famous places or high-ranking people, such as the President of the United States. Moreover, you know that nobody is going to get die or get seriously hurt, except perhaps the dastardly devious villain. Worse, you know a movie like ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" is second-rate when the cartoon shown before it is more amusing than anything in this rated PG, 130 action-adventure comedy of errors. Right, the best thing about ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" is the Walt Disney Studios' cartoon about Goofy and his arduous antics to assemble a high-definition television set within the confines of his modest home.",2007

The outraged Ben decides to prove the honor of his ancestor and together with his wife Abigail (Diane Kruger) and his best friend, the writer Riley Poole (Justin Bartha), they head to France, England and Washington to collect clues to lead them to a lost city of gold Cinola and clean the name of Thomas Gates.

8,"First of all, National Treasure, the first one, is one of my favorite movie ever. I love history, specifically American history, and it had clever references and facts about American history that lead to finding the treasure in a way that is not predictable. That being said, I felt something was missing in National Treasure: Book of Secrets. It almost felt like the writers could not think of any new, clever clues for Nicolas Cage to solve or more suspense without action scenes.",2007
7,"It was a good movie but not as good as the first one. I think that its just the same story as the first one with very little changes. Treasure hunter Ben Gates tries to clean its name by looking for an ancient treasure. The first half of the movie is kinda slow and even tiresome, too much talking and very little action. But it gets better on the second part towards to the end. The cast is excellent, Nicolas Cage in a role he knows very well, Jon Voight as Cage fathers is very convincing, Ed Harris is the bad guy that the only thing he wants is to find the treasure and keep it to himself, Harvey Keitel as an FBI agent wit a brief but convincing performance and Helen Mirren as Nicola's mother with a good and even funny performance. Although this movie isn't the greatest thing, it is very enjoyable and entertaining, perfect to spend some time with the family.",2008
4,"I loved the first movie but this sequel simply *missed* the motivational villain. But what can you expect when everyone in this sequel when the main characters are suppose to be 'rich', except for Riley of course. I quote my husband as to ""why are they having a car chase in London?"" I simply answered...""I don't know."" At least the villain in the first National Treasure tried to figure out clues and paid people to give up letters to a puzzle, this villain simply leaned back and let Gates do everything for him. Which admittedly was not as appealing as to wondering if he would figure out the clue before Gates did. The motivation of the villain simply wasn't all that plausible. I mean come on, I'm sure if he'd approached Gates as a fellow treasure hunter to look for Gates would have helped him. So the villain was unimpressive.",2008

I mean really, I would have made the same choice, because this film is truly high art. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the first installment for its poor-man's Indiana Jones feel mixed with glossy effects and convoluted plot lines (Bruckheimerisms as I like to call them) and for the most part had fun with this one. Well that is until the discovery was complete, then the film just dragged on and on for what seemed like hours. This is a Disney film people, you know they will find the treasure and all will be well with the world. Therefore, all the intrigue and the discoveries to find the location of their desire, complete with massively annoying cross cuts between four different locales and ten different characters every five minutes, was totally subverted by the ending's adventure nonsense with no stakes because we all know how it would turn out. There were two things going for it though, I became real nostalgic for ""Legends of the Hidden Temple"" and found out that yes, Lyle Lovett is still alive.",2007
8,"This time around in ""National Treasure: Book of Secrets"" Benjamin Gates (Nicholas Cage) and his father Patrick (Jon Voight) exonerate the good name of Great Grandfather Gates for the heinous assassination coup of Abraham Lincoln. Ed Harris's Mitch Wilkinson makes this startling allegation along with possessing incriminating evidence of a long held family letter. Also in prescribed convoluted fashion clearing the Gates family name explicably leads to the search for the mythical City of Gold thought to be built by Native American Ancestors. Go figure. Clues to The City of Gold are uncovered from the desks of the Queen of England and the Oval Office itself. The key to The City of Gold and the Lincoln Conspiracy is concealed in the ubiquitous Book of Secretsan urban legend of sorts. The Book of Secrets originated in the Hayes Administration, and consequently handed down to each succeeding President. Apparently, this Book documents all of our National Secrets running the gamut from Area 51 to the final Warren Commission Report. To obtain The Book of Secrets, Ben must kidnap the President of the United States. No problem.",2007

That, and the  addition of Helen Mirren as Nicholas Cage's mother to strengthen the  film's female roles thanks to leading lady Diane Kruger's utter  mediocrity.  The film has all the same history mystery you remember, the national  (and now international) landmarks, the witty inserts from Justin  Bartha's character Riley, and of course the preposterous plans for  Benjamin Franklin Gates to get whatever he's after. In other words, if  you're looking for something different, more clever, or intellectually  stimulating, read the Da Vinci Code again and don't bother with this  film. If you want more quirky, ridiculous, treasure-seeking fun that  picks up right where the last left off, this is your ticket. ~Steven C",2007
8,"If I may be able to conjure up conspiracy theories of my own, then I will attempt to hypothesis how National Treasure came about to debut on the big screen, based on opportunities which presented itself at the right time. First, the popularity of Dan Brown's controversial The Da Vinci Code, which was made into a movie of its own, but took a tad too long in doing so. Topping the bestseller charts around the world, it made Hollywood execs sit up and realize that wild goose chases and solving riddles and clues do make an interesting, workable formula. Coupled by the fact that the Indiana Jones trilogy (at the time) probably will not have another sequel see the light of day, then the onus is on crafting a tale based on controversies, with Indy Jones tendencies, and chances are a new winner will be born.",2007
6,I really liked the first movie with these characters but I got frustrated with this sequel. I was expecting much more intelligent puzzles and breathtaking adventure. Instead this movie is a perfect example of a sugarcoated adventure for family viewing in a lazy Saturday night in DVD in pijamas snacking microwave popcorn.,2007
1,"Okay- So I have a problem with the entire premise. First off- If you want a treasure to remain hidden, why give all the ""cryptic"" clues? Secondly, who left the clues anyway if no one remembered where the treasure is hence the hundreds of years to find it again?",2008
2,"Implausible plot and development with some ridiculous devices and chase sequences, but Americans can stand tall as one of their finest cracks the secret of the 'Lost City of Gold' that the conquistadors kept looking for in South and Central America, while all along it was hidden away in the Black Hills of Dakota! And ignored by that humdrum President Calvin Coolidge, and also by Queen Victoria, who had all the clues! Daft and a repeat of the first film, but some sly gags and a swift pace recommends about 15 minutes of this film. But please save us from the US 'redemption' motif of Ed Harris - nasty would-be killer to fame 'wannabe' to heroic sacfricer!!!!!! Ugh! Villains are just plain bad, even if they are US citizens.",2011
10,"I must say that I have really started to like British Comedy. Gavin and Stacey has become my second favorite show behind the IT Crowd. I love some American shows like Seinfeld and All in the Family, but love watching and learning about the different cultures of British television. I just don't understand the 6 episodes per year for 3 years thing. I really need more of Gavin and Stacey as I'm just starting to really love it and it is already over. So much talent, character development, and plot only to be cut short by about 100 episodes. The show is really one of those shows that you just can forget about life for a while and have fun watching on the weekends. I find myself saying Lush, Cracking, and Hiya more times than I really want to say them. On the off chance that the stars of the show ever read these reviews please do everybody a favor and make more episodes. I see so many talented people think they can create something better, when the best thing they have ever done is right under their noses. I'm not sure the actors know what this show means to the true fans. We work hard each week and wait to watch the next episode. 20 is not enough and the story has not been told but only just started! This is a cannot miss for almost any fan of sitcoms. Do yourself a favor and spend about 8 hours watching all 20 episodes and you will be craving a 4th, 5th, and 6th season like the rest of us.",2011
10,I bought the complete series of Gavin & Stacey in a box-set and could not stop watching it even though I wanted to delay watching the third and final season as it would mean that my viewing pleasure would be shortened.,2011
10,"An absolutely superb comedy, top class acting and the writing is incredible. This truly is one of the greatest comedy series I have seen in years.",2008
8,"In the 1980s, the most famous hit of writer John Sullivan was 'Only Fools and Horses', but what actually won bigger ratings was a gentler comedy drama he wrote about two people falling in love, 'Just Good Friends'. And in some ways, 'Gavin and Stacey', a low key hit, is the 'Just Good Friends' of our time. At initial acquaintance, it's not riotously funny, and it's certainly not savage (unlike 'Pulling', another BBC3 hit); but the more you watch it, the more you find yourself smiling throughout, simply because the world it depicts is unquestionably the real world: this, in a way that few other television programs are, is a story of contemporary life. The central role of Gavin is quite passive and non-comic: the other characters are one-part sitcom staple, one part modern cliché, but still original - the mix works, supporting by acting and direction which overplays nothing and stays true to the rhythms of the everyday. As such, it's a record for the historians of the future to judge our age by; but very much also a comedy for us to laugh at now.",2008
9,"I must say I can't quite understand the previous reviewer, as I think they are on a different planet to anyone else and I felt compelled to put the record straight.",2007
10,Being Welsh this is a typically stereotypical view of the way we live out life in Wales. But we don't mind being the but of a joke every now and then. Particularly when the joke is as good as this.,2008
10,"I recently caught the entire series on BBC3 back to back in one evening and must confess, I was laughing out loud more than any BBC comedy for a very long time.",2008
10,"This is an absolutely brilliant series with wonderful characters saying hugely funny things. I'm Welsh and I have never seen anything which captures the rhythm of the way Welsj people speak like this, but the Essex characters are just as good in their ways. This isn't just the best comedy the BBC has done for a long time; it's the best series of any kind for a very long time. Everyopne will have their favourites amongst the characters but I defy anyone who has ever been west of the Severn Bridge not to see Bryn as the ultimate hero. Lots of the success lies in the timing, because the actors don't stand around for hours trying to milk laughs. All in all a very tidy show.",2008
9,This was an outstanding series - won a few awards as well. This is Welsh humour and needs to be listened to so that you understand the joke. Many might need slapstick for humour but this picks up on the way many Welsh families are intertwined and how the matriarchal and patriarchal figures are often figures of humour. Ruth Jones demonstrates real skill in playing such a part and the cast is full of home grown talent.,2008
10,"I cannot understand the previous comments either. This is one of the funniest 'feel nice' programmes I have ever seen. Perhaps it will only appeal to the British humour, but I doubt it. Ruth Jones is simply the best or in her own words 'Tidy'. The writing by Jones and Corden is ingenious and appeals to all age groups, the well deserved their awards. I watched the first series whilst it was showing for the first time, I watched it again during the BBC3 Gavin and Stacey evening, and even bought the DVD. (Something which I don't usually do) The second series is now being shown on BBC3 and it is just as good as the first. Lets hope there are more to come. If the BBC keep coming up with programmes like this then I will never moan about paying my TV licence again!",2008
9,"I had never watched this before when it was broadcast on television, but I had heard about how popular and critically acclaimed it was, so when I was able to I watched the whole lot in one go. Basically level-headed Gavin Shipman (The Catherine Tate Show's British Comedy Award nominated Mathew Horne) from Billericay, Essex, and bubbly Stacey West (Love Actually's British Comedy Award nominated Joanna Page) from Barry in the Vale of Glamorgan, Wales, have been talking romantically on the phone for six months, and they finally arrange a face to face meeting. Gavin lives with his parents, down-to-earth father Michael 'Mick' (EastEnders' Larry Lamb) and house-proud, over-protective and reputation caring Pamela Andrea 'Pam' (Clockwise's Alison Steadman), and spends time with his oldest and closest best friend, Neil 'Smithy' Smith (The History Boys' BAFTA and twice British Comedy Award winning (and nominated), and British Comedy Award nominated James Corden). Stacey meanwhile lives with her caring widowed mother Gwen West (Being Human's Melanie Walters), gets frequent visits from protective and jolly uncle Bryn (The Big Fat Quiz of the Year's BAFTA and British Comedy Award nominated Rob Brydon), and spends time with best friend Vanessa Shanessa 'Nessa' Jenkins (Fat Friends' British Comedy Award winning (and twice nominated) Ruth Jones). Throughout the series we see the key moments of the relationship, the first meeting, the first kiss, meeting each other's families, becoming engaged, getting married, finding a house, briefly splitting, looking for new jobs and trying to conceive. The series also consists on the full family coming together for the small and non dramatic events, e.g. playing a pub quiz, having a takeaway, having a night out, a day at the beach, and the same goes for the conversations, realistically simple and non significant, but there are also the meaningful occasions, such as weddings, christenings, birthday parties and Christmas. While Gavin and Stacey provide the emotional core of the show, there are also the smallest subplots, such as Smithy and Nessa have a contrasting relationship, filled with dislike and one-night stands, one of which creating a baby that forces them together, and when Nessa becomes engaged to Dave Coaches (Ali G Indahouse's Steffan Rhodri) there is a big conclusion to their relationship in the end. Other subplots in the story that create other interest and humour are Pam trying to convince everyone that she is vegetarian when of course she is not and is desperate to keep up the pretence and not eat meat, which is hard, Bryn has many encounters with Stacey's older brother Jason (Robert Wilfort) who is gay, and they often discuss something that happened on a fishing trip between them. Also starring Russell Tovey as Budgie and Pam Ferris as Cath. This programme is really funny when it wants to be, but it is also brilliant for being so simple with many lovable characters, not least Smithy with his fun-loving and cool persona, and Nessa with her catchphrases ""What's occurring?"", ""How's it going', alright"" and ""Oh!"", the relationship concept building up quickly by each episode is clever, and the scripting by Corden and Jones is fantastic, I would highly recommend everyone watch this highly entertaining British romantic comedy drama. Note not just the Christmas special, but also the fantastic number single made for Comic Relief by Bryn, Nessa and Sir Tom Jones, ""Islands In The Stream"", and other great Comic Relief appearances by Smithy. It won the British Comedy Awards for Best Television Comedy, Best New TV Comedy (Scripted) and Best TV Comedy, and it won the National Television Award for Most Popular Comedy Programme. Very good!",2011
10,"This came on the telly when we were having a more stressful time than usual at home, when the need for light relief on the box is essential. It does not have a deep complex plot or a constant supply of gags, the humour is in watching the characters do their stuff. I guess it wont appeat to some people but we love it and have watched it over and over. All the acting is brilliant, all the characters are well drawn and quirky in their own way, and the joy is in watching how these characters will behave in this week's episode. The humour is very subtle, never laboured and we have noticed things we missed even after watching several times. This wont appeal to everyone and I think if after giving a couple of episodes a go you haven't enjoyed it you probably wont. But if you like stuff thats not quite mainstream and a bit different, and want something you can watch again and again to lift your spirits, then I cant recommend this enough. We reckon that the character of Ness could be a category of her own in the British TV quiz, 'mastermind'. If you see it you'll get what I mean.....",2012
10,"From great phrases to great characters. Gavin and Stacey has it all. The characters are all unique and have a story. The first episode, starts by the two main characters, Gavin Shipman ( Mathew Horne) Stacey West ( Joanna Page) talking on the phone at work, the characters are meeting up in London, after their relationship has blossomed online. They meet and the characters instantly bond. By the second episode, Gavin has proposed. To which Stacey's widowed mother Gwen and uncle Bryn (Rob Brydon) aren't to pleased about, has Stacey has been engaged 5 times before!. On the other hand, Gavin's parents Pam Shipman ( Alison Steadman) and Mick Shipman (Larry Lamb) are really happy about and plan to meet Stacey's family. With laughs love and excitement, Gavin and Stacey is the perfect programme to watch and is suitable for all.",2011
10,"If you've never seen this show, but you've read the premise and seen a clip or two, let me guess what you're thinking...... (1) The premise sounds a bit flimsy especially for three series' worth (2) The clips aren't very funny (3) It's the BBC, meh meh meh. I thought all these things too. I cannot stress too strongly how utterly, completely wrong I was. Gavin & Stacey is so good it's stunning. The writing is glorious - how can they create such characters? They're carved from real life and yet they just spring into your living room, it involves you right from the start, you feel part of it. And the performances.....! Effortless! Not a single moment is wasted in any episode, every character from the mains right down to characters that only appear once.... it's rich, powerful, hilariously funny, heart-wrenching and completely lovable. It will make you glad you're alive.",2010
9,"My younger sister (she's 19) and I (aged 22) both love this series. Before I watched the third series on BBC One, I saw the majority of series two episode four where Gavin and Stacey go house-hunting and have an argument at a bowling alley when it was repeated on BBC Three. My care home support staff gave me the first two series of the show on DVD for Christmas last year. I'd already heard of Ruth Jones and Rob Brydon before I watched this series because they were previously in 'Little Britain.' Now I've heard of most of the cast because of this show and I have also seen Joanna Page as the woman in the simulated sex scenes in 'Love Actually.' ",2010
10,"Gavin & Stacey is proof that a comedy with heart can easily win out over the inundation of over-hyped, charmless sitcoms from the US.",2008
10,"The English have done it again, they do this marvelous TV show and give us about 6 episodes a year, it is unacceptable that I will have to wait till the end of next year to watch some more ""Gavin and Stacey""! It is the same thing with ""Peep Show"" and ""The IT crowd"".",2009
9,"I have just watched the 2008 Christmas special. I feel a mixture of emotions, but the strongest is the oddest, but perhaps the most important. If any of you foreign (not British) followers of the IMDb have any queries about what life is like for the majority of us Brits-THIS IS WHAT IT'S LIKE.",2008
1,"The BBC seems to have commissioned some very conservative stuff (ie soft writing about soft targets) for the main channels lately. I suppose 'G&S' comes under the banner of 'regional comedy', like 'Bread', or - sorry, but I can't think of any other gag-free, mawkish, undemanding sub-soap operas at the moment. Apart from 'My Family', that is. But even though you can see the payoffs in that coming a mile away, at least 'My Family' makes a stab at witty dialogue and plot structure. 'Gavin and Stacey' fans, however, seem content to laugh at people 'just like their Nan' picking their noses, usually in slow motion, though maybe that's just the leaden writing giving that impression. These are supposed to be real characters, are they? Yes, and very, very ordinary they are too. Presumably a nation brought up on 'Bob the Builder' and 'Thomas the Tank Engine' considers a Welsh or Essex accent the height of in-depth characterisation. Alison Steadman deserves particular excoriation for her patronising caricature of somebody 'common'. G&S is anodyne mush for the self-loathing masses, who voted for it in droves and only proved how much they love to be patronised and mocked behind their backs. If you happen to be a Martian visitor reading this (and the contradictions this review will no doubt draw, assuming anybody reads this far) please remember that G&S isn't universally popular, so don't judge the whole planet too harshly. For current observational British comedy with any bite at all, try 'Pulling' instead.",2008
2,"I will be the first to admit that I thoroughly enjoyed the 1st season, but from the 2nd season onwards someone has obviously forgotten to insert any jokes!!! Kind of odd for a ""comedy"" series I think! Instead they are focusing on overplayed drawn out dialogue (ordering a curry) and giving more time to possibly the 2 most irritating characters I have ever seen on TV Pete & Dawn...... Another big wrong is that in the 1st season Stacey was adorable, cute & very likable, now they have just made her a squeaky, whiny & extremely annoying little girl.",2009
7,"Gavin And Stacey is a brilliant show. One of the best UK sitcoms of this decade, revolving around the general theme of a long distance relationship, quick marriage and how the distance between Essex (Gavin's home) and Barry, Wales (Stacey's home) underlining that situation – us being treated to the idiosyncrasies of their rival clans along the way. Two strong supporting characters are Nessa and Smiffy (Ruth Jones and James Corden – the show's writers), who try to face up to the life lessons an unplanned pregnancy brings, whilst Rob Brydon shines as stand-out character Bryn (Stacey's ever-present Uncle). There are some poignant moments along the way. The last episode of the first series, where Bryn reads a note from Stacey's deceased father, is very moving indeed. Some moments are a little bit too cloying for my liking (the last episode of series 2 featuring far more situation than comedy), but on the whole I've thoroughly enjoyed the series.",2008
8,"This is a WONDERFUL comedy, and I can't recommend it enough! The very first episode had me hooked, and I finished the entire series in pretty much one sitting. Smithy and Nessa are my favorites, they're completely lovable characters and I think Jones and Corden were at their prime for this entire show. As someone who isn't Welsh or English, I liked how the slapstick and deadpan comedy still made everything so relatable and even though some of the obscure references went over my head, I still think every inch of it was ace. Every episode guarantees a good time, and some hearty laughs. It took me a while to warm up to some of the supporting characters though, but I think all in all they're collectively brilliant, and this show deserves to have more reruns aired on regular TV! Absolute must-see. Please give it a chance! It is very much comedy gold and is SO MUCH BETTER than most of the crap that passes for comedy on TV nowadays (ex., later seasons of HIMYM, blech). Have fun seeing it!",2015
10,"A great cast brings the story of a Welsh young woman, Stacey, and an Essex young man, Gavin, into a lovely realistic romance. The cast are first rate with Larry Lamb and Alison Steadman playing Gavin's parents. I adore Steadman as Pam. Melanie Walters does a great job as Stacey's widowed mother. The first season is about their first meeting to their wedding day. Along the out of studio and audience, there are plenty of laughs especially with the creators and writers, James Cordern and Ruth Jones, who play pals, Smithy and Nessa. I adore Ruth Jones who plays the role and steals every scene. I would watch a show around Ruth Jones talent every day. Both Jones and Stacey (played by Joanna Page) are Welsh which adds to the authenticity to the show's success. It's realistic and believable about two families from different parts of the country getting together to celebrate a couple's love and determination to stay together.",2014
3,"I had to stop watching this after the 3rd episode of the first series, I was cringing throughout at the poor acting, unnecessary over enunciation of the welsh accent and all things welsh and the unrealistic scenes, ( armed police about to fire on gavin for jumping over a ticket barrier). This tries hard and if I was very simple or very easily pleased, I guess i would find it funny but this was embarrassing to watch. Maybe the reason for the lame writing is because the two writers were two of the central characters here (james corden was especially hamming up his lines), either way it was a waste of Alison Steadman's considerable talents.",2009

9,"There is just no way to explain the plot of this film and not have it sound rather silly and this film is anything but foolish frivolity. I found it utterly charming and carefully and delicately directed. There are moments of belly shaking humor and quiet tears as Ryan Gosling brilliantly evolves from a reclusive soul with the help of a silicone woman and a kind hearted community. I want to know these endearing people. There is a moral point to this film, perhaps more than one. Don't be put off by the synopsis, or trailer. This is not your standard Hollywood fare. See it for the humor, or the humanity, either way, you will be glad you did. I see very, very few films twice- this one is on my list.",2007
10,"This is one of the most remarkably original films that I have ever seen, providing a refreshing comment that we can learn and expand our horizons from each other if we approach everyone's foibles with a degree of kindness. It is laugh-out-loud funny, but it is also thought-provoking and moving.",2007
9,"Mislead by some comments here i expected a laugh-out comedy, Ben Stiler style. Many other people in the cinema expected the same and from the beginning of the film they laughed at the slightest hint that something might be funny. Little by little though, the laughs went to silence and people understood they were watching a drama, not a comedy. Indeed there were scenes that made you laugh, but the more important scenes were those that take you by the heart and make you feel and understand. Thanks to the great acting by Ryan Gosling, Emily Mortimer, Paul Schneider, Patricia Clarkson, all the supporting cast, you get a feel of a community of neighbors, friends, family, perhaps too idealized, but nevertheless, giving hope and warmth.",2007
8,"Greetings again from the darkness. Guilt while laughing is an unusual experience ... well except while watching Lars and Bianca. This film is hilarious, touching and insightful. The product of genius writing by Nancy Oliver (Six Feet Under) and solid direction by Craig Gillespie (""Mr. Woodcock""), this film will force you to step back and think about how you treat those who might be a little different or struggle with social interaction.",2007
7,"""Lars and the Real Girl"" may come off as an unrealistic, over-the-top, completely unfathomable fairytale for the mentally ill while the line between realism and fantasy is tightly walked. Some of the actions of the characters are questionable- mostly with the way the townspeople treat Lars and his delusions. Lars is incredibly shy. He sits alone in the dark. He'll make up any excuse he can muster to avoid even a simple breakfast at his brother's house (He lives in the garage; separated from the house of course, and completely isolated / detached from human contact). Lars struggles to connect with people, which is due to years of neglect from his father, and the death of his mother during child birth. His brother left the first chance he got, so Lars has never felt love, nor has he been given the chance to share his love for others.",2008

But, here I am, going through at least 3 Kleenex even after the movie is over. Lars and the Real Girl is a touching, quirky film that is a lesson in why people do the things they do.

9,"I just saw a screening in LA and a packed house of SAG members LOVED this film! Ryan Gosling's performance hearkens back an equally moving and effective performance from Peter Sellers in Being There, which Gosling and director Craig Gilespie admitted was about their only reference point. Gosling's character is sweet, good natured, and painfully shy and is the heart and soul of this film. His performance as Lars (along with patient direction and a wonderful script) is the prime reason that it all works. I laughed HARD throughout, but by the end I shed real tears over the plot and characters - and I thought doing so over a talking pig was bad! This is a performance WAY out of the ordinary for Gosling, and most of today's young actors could not have pulled it off. Expect an Oscar nomination for Gosling and for the screenplay.",2007

My take on this film is best expressed by Manohla Dargis in the NYT (before you bother with it, you really should read her thoughtful review that puts this film in context). I realize that MD and mine are minority views. But if you feel the need for a feel-good, slightly teary (but definitely not a tear-jerker), good hearted (ever single person , including extras, appearing even momentarily on screen, is kind and considerate), it's-not-a-wonderful-life-but-really- is small town fantasy that require a further suspension of suspended disbelief, this is it.",2011

I'm sure many people will enjoy this film, but I most definitely did not, and will not recommend it to anybody. I honestly have no idea how this film was nominated for an Oscar,unless it was for the music, which is vaguely whimsical but always charming. In my opinion there are far better films which touch on mental illness such as Defendor or Girl Interrupted.",2011

The film follows Lars' relationship with his doll and how those around him deal with the situation and eventually help him out of his shell.",2009
9,"This 2007 film's askew sensibilities and deadpan manner will be familiar to anyone who has watched HBO's Six Feet Under with any regularity since six episodes were written by the film's screenwriter, Nancy Oliver. However, coupled with Craig Gillespie's thoughtful and gently sauntering direction, her script has an added dimension of humanism that grounds the preposterous-sounding concept of a socially awkward, small-town bachelor who becomes enamored with a blow-up doll. The premise would seem ideal for Jim Carrey or Will Ferrell, but this is not a flat-out, slapstick comedy. It's actually a whimsical allegory that touches on serious issues related to emotional isolation and the unacknowledged inability to handle personal loss.",2007
6,"First let me say that this movie was highly recommended to me by a number of folks which may explain why I was disappointed. (Needless to say, when you see a movie with zero expectations you tend to be a lot more forgiving) Not sure how many people remember ABC after school specials, but this movie kind of felt like one of those, and probably would have been better had it been compressed into 1 hour of television.",2008
5,"Ryan Gosling plays Lars, a man with a severe social disorder. He usually avoids contact with people, even his brother (Paul Schneider) and sister-in-law (Emily Mortimer). But then Lars orders a sex doll from the internet, and he pretends that she is real and is his girlfriend. The local doctor (Patricia Clarkson) suggests that everyone in the small town in which they live go along with the delusion, hoping Lars is just working things out in his head. It's kind of a cute concept, but, honestly, I could never buy into it. First off, before the sex doll arrives, Lars seems weird but not so crazy as to do as he does. A person so removed from reality probably wouldn't attend church every week, and certainly wouldn't be able to hold down a regular job in an office. And while I might buy that some of the people close to Lars would go along with the game, it's not easy to buy that everyone in town would be happy about it. There are numerous scenes with the town's children, the most literal-minded members of the human species, sitting around not even questioning the situation, including one bizarre scene in which she is supposedly reading aloud to kids without Lars even there. Then there's this one character, played by the lovely young Kelli Garner, who has a crush on Lars from the beginning of the film. Instead of reacting with horror at Lars's girlfriend and running away, she is, while at first shocked, eventually charmed by it. People just don't act like real people in this film. And even if I could buy into it all, I felt that the film was too repetitive, always cutting to unfunny reaction shots of a new person meeting Bianca, which is what Lars calls the doll, or even less funny reaction shots of the doll itself. The performances are generally good. I think Gosling, who was fantastic in his Oscar-nominated performance in Half Nelson, relies a bit too much on method acting, with his constant blinking and whatnot. One might call him Chaplinesque at times, like in the scene where he pretends to bring Garner's teddy bear back to life. But I was more thinking of Johnny Depp pretending to be Chaplin in Benny & Joon, which is a similar but much better movie. The only actor who rises above the mediocre material is Emily Mortimer, who is the only one, in my opinion, who sells the concept. I really believed that she would care enough about her brother-in-law to go along with his delusion. It's her finest performance yet in a career I'm sure will become much bigger.",2008
9,"When I first saw this advertised on television I thought it might be a fun little show, I didn't think it would be something I'd want to own on DVD though... I soon realised that this was something special; the colours are all brighter than normal, the dialogue is more wordy than people really use and the plot is surreal to say the least. All these things could have lead to a disaster but it worked perfectly for me. The cast did a great job bringing their surreal world to life.",2009
10,"This show is addictively wonderful. The writing and acting are fantastic. Funny, touching, and also intrigue all wrapped into one. Be sure to get this into your DVD player and enjoy it from the beginning to the unexpectedly short end. Watch it, watch it, watch it! There are some great characters and great guest appearances that only help add to the endearing aspect of the show. Kudos to the writers for developing a great storyline that only gets better over time. I just don't understand why this wasn't interesting for the American TV public. Bad time? Too quirky? Not enough studio support? I suspect that the production costs were very high, but all parts of the show (directly, special effects, costumes, sets) are great. Thank goodness it's on DVD, and I can only hope that it somehow comes back in one way, shape, or form.",2009

10,"""Pushing Daisies"" was a marvelously original show--so much so that it had to fail. After all, good television is like the sentiment 'no good deed goes unpunished'! And, like a wonderful show, it manages to start off with a real bang--with an episode that keeps you wanting more.",2011
10,"Are you kidding me?? This show is WONDERFUL! Perhaps it may be because I have watched it from episode 1, thus... fully understand the concept completely. Or perhaps it is because I stumbled upon this show by random and had no preconceived feelings.",2009
9,"This was my number one show to watch. I have decided not to start watching a new show so that I won't be disappointed because of it's abrupt end. I loved the show. Even though it was frustrating regarding the plot line, the writing and humor got me every show. They could have found a loophole. There is always a loophole, especially with such a magical plot line. Everyone on the show was very talented, and I could believe their fanciful characters. The musical numbers helped drive the suspension of disbelief. Glee has show us that. The only reason I turned to Glee was because of the loss of Pushing Daisies. It is much less mature and negative in humor, but it has it's fun parts too. I wish that a show like this would get more support.",2009

9,"Pushing Daisies is just a lovely fairy tale, with shades of ""Amelie""'s aesthetic and romance. It's got a beautiful palette, its shots well thought out and detailed, its names and dialogue whimsical and too cutesy to be real, its imagination great, and its romance deep.",2009
9,"With reality TV and so and so hitting the airwaves, this show is ""a breath of fresh air"" in Must See TV department. Fan favorites like CSI, Lost, and of course ""Heroes"" (also my favorite) are great and all but I long for something more ""out there"". The movie industry can learn something from this especially with today's summer blockbuster bang and boom to produce something that not only has the potential to bring more people into the theaters, but most importantly, realize that originality and innovation can be more effective than special effects and action with cheesy one-liners and whatnot. Secondly, top-notch acting combined with stellar writing and a great ensemble cast can make all the difference. With a movie season plagued with sequels and remakes, we can all agree on one thing: We want something different!! Give this show a chance. Support it. Maybe Hollywood would catch on and give moviegoers and casuals something new to taste(albeit visually and mentally).",2007
4,"The show sounded VERY scripted, forced and it is following the SiFi trend of Heroes, The Lost Room, etc.... Yes, I see the creator of PD is the same as Heroes. I like the idea but I don't think it was delivered very well. There are also some problems with the first episode such as: Lee with the gift feels obligated to Chi. Why, I don't know since nobody would believe Chi if he outed Lee. Also, when Chi witnessed the guy falling off the building only to be brought back to life by Lee, a normal person would not believe what they just saw. Chi believe what he saw right away. Also, Anna was very quick to believe that Lee could bring people back to life.",2007

And then the specifics of how old everyone is when they died, as if that has any significance other than giving the show some ridiculously gimmicky hallmark. Yes, yes, he's a famous voice-over guy! He does the Harry Potter books on tape! Whee! Doesn't make him any less irritating.",2007

4,"I was intrigued by the premise of Pushing Daisies, and I liked the people involved with it--Lee Pace acting, with Fuller and Sonnenfeld at the helm. I should have known it was the kiss of death for this show (pun not really intended). The two producers are kings of the one-season series, not always because of their own fault. If this one goes down, however, it might just be their fault. From the very beginning, this show suffered from ""Look How Clever I Am!"" syndrome, with its cutesy names for everything, and it's painfully self-aware narration (do we REALLY need to know how many MINUTES old every damn character is), and its dialoguey dialogue. OK, not everything has to be hyper-real, but if you want us to invest our time and our care into a series, let us forget sometimes that it's a series. Let us get lost in the tale, and forget about the telling.",2007
4,"I guess stealing from yourself is not as bad as stealing from someone else, but it does tend to keep you in the same rut. The creator of ""Pushing Daisies"", Bryan Fuller, simply recycled his premise from ""Dead Like Me"", even having the characters headquartered out in a waffle (pie) house. The only substantial changes are a surreal production design and an ""Ameilie"" type storytelling technique; presumably to give the thing a more absurdest feel. CW Television has also stolen Fuller's DLM idea for a spectacularly bad show called ""Reaper"", which premiered this fall.",2007
6,"For a TV show it is Original, I guess. But it's not an original concept at all. It is a complete homage to the french movie Amélie. In fact, the music in the first episode when we first meet the Aunts, is also used in the movie...I think. Anyway, I'll give this show a chance, but what bothers me about it is that it does feel like someone trying to tell a story using someone else's style. Watch Amélie and you'll see what I mean. Not that the show is bad, but it just feels like the action is there to serve the style rather, so it doesn't feel as natural. It's like to a man with a hammer everything looks like a nail. So it's almost like a writing exercise. Write a one hour TV show in the style of Amelie. That's a little bit how it feels like, so it seems a little contrived. But it's only a pilot, so they may find their own voice as the series progresses.",2007

Ned can't act, he just stands and mumbles while gazing lovingly at chuck. chuck just acts annoyingly perky like a blonde cheerleader. olive and Emerson is the only good ones. at least Emerson is cynical and practical and funny, while olive has a great voice. the plot is like a kiddy show, with mysteries a toddler can figure out, and a happy ever after boring storyline. if you can turn the dead to living, won't you want to bring alive ancient leaders like Tutankhamen or qing shi Huang, to figure out the mysteries of history? and not just become a pie maker, of all jobs??? the show also doesn't explain HOW Ned got this power. if he has the power, he should tell the national security or something, they can do tests on him and unravel the mysteries of the human body, and they can give him bodyguards to ensure people not kidnapping him to revive bad guys.",2008
1,"After watching one and half episodes I was thoroughly bored. The intended humor comes thick and fast, but it's not funny. The acting is more wooden than cardboard standees of Captain Kirk. The story lines... what story lines?

2,"Before starting to watch the show, I've heard it was great and aesthetically very interesting. What a deception, the scripts are so dumb that I am quite sure the authors are son and grandson of Scoobidoo writers. And what about the SFX and colors, they are so extreme that it is painful to watch, colors are not saturated they are over saturated, like scripts are overwritten and show is overrated. This show is like a bad pie in which a child would have put only sugar and butter thinking that because these ingredients are the best, they are sufficient. Unfortunately for this show, the only two ingredients of this show are finally vacuity and a total lack of credibility.",2008

7,"""Secret Diary of a Call Girl"" a new ""Showtime"" cable series certainly has a theme and topic of interest that viewers love to see and explore. That the sex industry and also at the same time they get a real life look at the life of a high class call girl. The series is based on the memoir ""The Intimate Adventures of a London Call Girl"", yet this series is just as interested in everyday life moments as it is the sex trade. Billie Piper is Hannah by day and ""Belle"" by night to her clients and she as a high class London hooker who swears she took the job because she loves sex so much! And believe me this series is very provocative and blunt showing many of the make out scenes that really pushes the envelope even for top notch cable. Plenty of skin and sexy scenes are found with this series while at the same time as the viewer you feel the emotions of Hannah/Belle as each episode is narrated and told from her point of view and thoughts. Overall interesting series that's engrossing making it a good call to watch.",2008

Billie Piper was the perfect choice to play Belle, a high class prostitute living in London. Belle is more than happy to share her view on prostitution with us, explaining the highs and the lows, the different areas and how she copes. We also see Belle tackling several situations, including a client who likes her for who she is, not for the work she does, an awkward 42 year old client, and of course her keeping her double life secret from those she loves.",2008
10,"I have to say Billie Piper is a very special actress, her ability to make you believe, smile and cry are amazing, as Belle you feel for her almost to the point of being jealous of her , I know the actress/actor talking to the camera isn't new but it seems so right in ""Secret Diary of a Call Girl"" this series is a delicious look into the life of a hooker, call girl, whatever you wish to call it , its highs and lows with its hazards and bonuses. I've been a big fan of Billie since I saw how well she acted in a Doctor Who episode where she actually had me in tears!!! she is a very believable actress that blends into whatever she does whether its flirting with a time lord or charging for her company she seems to do it so easily. Don't miss it, rent it or buy it I guarantee you will not be disappointed , put it this way I would work with her any day lol",2008
4,"I'm rather surprised to see that some of the previous commentators who have also read the book didn't find it somewhat disturbing that that the main character has been quite dramatically changed.

7,"I would've given SDOACG an 8 out of 10, if it wasn't for the show's finale, which was ultimately unsatisfying and which didn't do justice to the growth of Hannah's character throughout 4 series. I liked Billie Piper here, and I appreciated how the show made an effort to make some nice lighthearted moments, even when they were ""scandalous"". Some of my favorite instances included her adventures with quite unconventional clients (handicapped teenage boys, an old couple wanting to check out a threesome, kinky rotund men) and one of my favorite episodes would have to be the one where she hired a call boy for a change. That was funny!",2015

7,"When I first ran into this show, I watched the first few episodes out of curiosity. I wanted to know if a show like this could be executed tastefully. Surprise, surprise—it can be. This show is not about what most of us would expect, adult scenes wrapped in with dialogue to make the entire phenomena more acceptable. Rather it is a real psychological journey through the minds of everyday people. The therapist/philosophers? Our resident whore: Belle. The show opens the minds and hearts of the audience to her lifestyle. The problems she faces are more human than we may realize. This show is worth watching if enjoy shows that explore the idiosyncrasies of humanity. A warning, there is a bit of flesh and odd scenarios portrayed—but nothing that people don't do, apparently.",2011
10,"I recently watched this TV series and loved it. It was funny, entertaining, and had lot's of romance and drama. It was interesting to see how Hannah's career as an escort affected her love life, and how the different men she dated had different reactions to her career. I also loved the different characters that were introduced throughout the series. I admit I was disappointed in the way the series ended, I felt like it needed more. I feel there was definitely room for another season! Hannah's narrating throughout the series was one of my favorite things, especially when she would say something out of the blue to the camera. I am certain I will re watch this TV series over and over again, and hope to see more just like it in the future.",2013

In these 3 seasons you have the opportunity to follow her and join her on her secret missions. You go on a journey with her and get to know the excitement covered with champagne and glamour. But also the reality about it. And if you had any prejudice about this profession at least it will soften by the charming character Bille Piper plays: Belle.",2011
5,"This film is poised somewhere neatly between being great and unique and being rather pedestrian and forgettable. On the negative side of the balance, there's a plot structure that one hopes would be more complex, but which ends up being as contrived as an early 20th Century film melodrama -- the orphaned baby in the hospital, threatened by ethnic gangsters... the all-too-obvious secret agent who blows his own cover but gets away with it... etc. On the other hand, Viggo Mortensen gives a decent performance, affected accent aside, and Vincent Cassel is brilliant. There are some pretty cool violent action scenes, which might be a positive or a negative for different people -- the director Cronenberg has often been accused of needless gore, while his defenders often argue that gore is a style and a manner of formalism for him. Eastern Promises always seems to hang just on the precipice of bad taste and even sheer stupidity, and the artistic accomplishment to which these ends are used is questionable in the end.",2009
9,"I was bowled over by Viggo Mortensen's performance. I saw the film about a week ago and his eyes, his look, his smirk has been with me every day since. He is rapidly becoming my favorite actor because he makes something new, long lasting, thought provoking and totally true, out of the characters he plays, the way he plays them and I feel also, why he plays them. Here he is a Russian mobster's driver, or is he? The important thing is that you won't be able to take your eyes of him. Here he has David Cronemberg at his side / or sides, once again. Cronemberg seems to know and understand Mortensen's power. And Mortensen seems to trust him completely. Eastern Promises is a really good film with and extraordinary Viggo Mortensen at its very core. Not to be missed.",2007
9,"It is not often that audiences today are treated to a film that has as many things going for it as Eastern Promises does. Whether it's because of interference from studios determined to make their products as marketable as possible, filmmakers who favor style over substance, or just a plain old shortage of originality, nowadays it is a treat when a film fan can leave the theater and feel affected by the artistry that he/she has just experienced.",2007
10,"First of all it is amazing the amount of research that went into this movie. When Mortissen's characters says that his father worked for the government, in Russian he actually says: ""Hunched his back for the uncle""! Even the poster with little and index finger straighter then the rest, it all breathers authenticity.",2007
8,"""Eastern Promises"" will take your breath away, churn your stomach, and then leave you with memories of unforgettable characters as well as perplexing thoughts about good and evil. David Cronenberg's movie about Russian and Chechen mobsters clashing in London is more than violent - it is brutal, savage, shocking. But do not expect just an action film, exploiting blood and gore. After you shake off its terrific immediate impact (there is no way to think while watching it), you realize that ""Eastern Promises"" is also a kind of morality tale, complex and important.",2007
10,"Russian mobsters, a rainy, murky London, a midwife and Viggo Mortensen makes this David Cronemberg film a perfect companion piece to his ""A History Of Violence"". My two favourite films of this idiosyncratic and fascinating director. Naomi Watts and motherhood go beautifully together and it's her gutsy maternal instinct that throws her in a world populated by truly horrible people. The trick is, we go with her and within that brutal world we meet some memorable characters. Viggo Mortensen, what an actor! His fearlessness is riveting, he's also beautiful beyond words. We think we can read him but we doubt our own thoughts, he's in total control of his character and of his audience. He has the face of an icon and he underplays it, over playing it. If you see History Of Violence and Eastern Promises you'll understand what I mean. This is not a film to like but to love and I loved it.",2007
9,"In a wet and dreary pre-Christmas London, an anonymous, distressed, 14-year old Russian girl staggers into Trafalgar hospital, on the verge of giving birth, hemorrhaging badly and with obvious heroine tracks on her arms. Pediatric nurse Anna (Naomi Watts) tries in vain to save both mother and baby, but in the end, all that remains is the newborn, and a diary written in Russian in the girl's purse, that contains a business card for a Russian restaurant. Haunted by her own previous miscarriage, and determined that the baby girl not be sent to an orphanage, Anna attempts to have the diary translated in order to identify the anonymous girl's family. In so doing, she becomes embroiled in the dark, seething world of crime, drugs, and prostitution of the Russian Mob. It is an enclosed, hot house society, where family loyalty and responsibility and adherence to the ""vory v zakone"" code of thieves are paramount, and shady characters like the ""restauranteur"" Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl), his son Kirill (Vincent Cassel) and his ""driver"" Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen) exist on the periphery of the law.",2007
9,"A terrific, tight, violent, homo erotic thriller with a soul and a heart and if that wasn't enough, Viggo Mortensen! He is an astonishing actor, he's always been. But now his Russian ""I'm just a driver"" goes further than most actors would have dared. He is magnetic. Cronenberg designs two lives again for him but this time the universe where he lives is made of monsters with an accent. The splendid Armin Mueller-Stahl's bonhomie doesn't fools us for a moment. ""A diary?"" That's enough for us to know and to fear. Vincent Cassel is also terrific and his down, tactile moments with Viggo Mortensen, have an erotic undercurrent that is impossible to ignore. Naomi Watts brings the heart to the proceedings without ever being sentimental. David Cronenberg, I feel, is entering a spectacular new face to his already remarkable career.",2007
8,"When I first saw the trailer for Eastern Promises, I was a little confused. Yes, A History of Violence was a complete turnaround style picture for David Cronenberg (whose previous films include the most twistedly eccentric visions of horrendously graphic violence and overtly over sexualized human beings and monsters), but I had not expected that he would continue down the path of the ""independent mainstream"". I was a little hesitant to see it at first, but gradually the trailer's imagery drew me in. And now I can say there really is a reason for the Oscar buzz.",2007
10,"Eastern Promises is a further proof David Cronenberg is one of the last classic film-makers left. At the same time, he is a modernist. The combination, in the dark London he created, is a moral tale which makes you think of Dostoievsky. It's a story of crime and redemption with an unusual (hidden) tenderness. At the same time, it is a very serious trip into the rites of a secret society as we can see more and more in our big cities. A criminal secret society.",2007
7,"Since Napoleon’s times everybody knows that try to understand Russian mysterious soul practically impossible. French froze near Moscow, Hitler took from his blitz – krig more than four years. Sum up. Russia is real marsh and better keep your nose clear out of there. But director David Kronenberg decides to forget about this experience. He invited brilliant editor and professional script writer and went in this greatest inferno. Irish, Jakudza, Cosa Nostra, international terrorism with Ben Laden – it is already was. And Kronenberg is discovering wild wild east – world of Russian organized criminality. Don’t get me wrong. The film are not bad. Vice versa – it is very good job. Foreign press gave highest estimation to movie. Russian audience was bought that filmmakers have laid off from Russian gangsters yshanki and valenki, took away balalaika and garmoshka and forever have separated with bears. Instead they have put on them stylish skin-jackets and Terminator’s sunglasses. And gave head role to King of Hondor Viggo Mortensen, who was painted from top to toe by prison’s tattoos Russian prison’s theme penetrate whole film. And it was head defect of film. Kronenberg have dived in that them too much and have forgotten that in Russia was change many things since 60-th, 70-th. Because of that, scene of crowning of Nikolai (not Romanov) was accompanied by laugh of Russian public in cinema theater. Yes hierarchy, yes tattoos, yes “… v zakone” but it was many many years ago and today in Russia this system is failed. And those lacks are provoking curl of the lips only. But important fact – action are happening in London. And who knows, may be in this ground of disgraced oligarchies and “vorov v zakone” all was kept. England is very conservative land. They have preserved monarchy. May be they have preserved Russian mafia too. Why not? But anyway, Eastern promises (on Russian translate “Vice on export”) a very good movie with professional direct and brilliant performances.",2007
8,"Ever since Cronenberg started making ""straight"" movies without (too many) splatter elements, something in his oeuvre had been lacking. ""Spider"" was beautifully photographed but a complete and utter bore. The much praised ""A History Of Violence"" had a great cast and a solid premise, but turned out to be just as boring and on top of that far-fetched and superficial. ""Eastern Promises"" finds Cronenberg finally coming to terms with his new ""realistic"" approach to movie making.",2008
9,"When it comes to films made by veteran Canadian director, David Cronenberg, certain promises are expected to be kept. The name promises something dark and twisted, something gruesome and haunting, something disturbing and seductive. Cronenberg's latest, EASTERN PROMISES, certainly makes good on all these accounts and solidifies his new, more linear but no less disconcerting approach to film-making. Gone are the days of surreal experiments where fetishists get off on colliding cars and the ensuing scars or twin gynecologists playing patients for patsies. Now is the time for the Russian mafia in London to be given a human touch. No, now Mr. Cronenberg is not so concerned with being bizarre as he is with being blunt. As with his last masterpiece, A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE, Cronenberg has made PROMISES into a straightforward story and morality tale, much to the dismay of film students everywhere. Fear not though, students. Accessibility does not make Cronenberg irrelevant. If anything, it means that brilliantly polished stories about the underbelly of humanity can be told without any unnecessary sentiment, allowing for them to be both provocative and bloody as all hell.",2007

However, Stepan translates part of the diary and Anna discovers that Semyon and his sick son Kirill (Vincent Cassel) had raped Tatiana when she was fourteen years old and forced her to work as prostitute in a brothel of their own. Further, Semyon is the dangerous boss of the Russian mafia ""Vory v Zakone"", jeopardizing the safety of Anna and her family. Meanwhile, Semyon's driver Nikolai Luzhin (Viggo Mortensen) gets close to Kirill and Semyon, climbing positions in the criminal organization, but he helps Anna, her family and the baby.",2008
1,"This movie would be OK, if one considers it a B rated genre piece of action, but the problem with it is that it is so pretentious and presents itself as some kind of realistic mafia/gangster movie at the same time lacking any sense of depth or any entertaining value. Cronenberg has his own recognizable style of making movies and it's visible in this one, and it saves a movie a little bit. I mean if you take it as some kinda Kill Bill with a bunch of bad guys and a bit of ethnic flavor it's OK, although still nothing much to talk about since the story line is so generic and flat one has to be a naive and impressionable teenager to be entertained by it.",2008
10,"David Cronenberg's Eastern Promises takes on, in the broadest stroke, the Russian mafia. But it's not that broad, per-say, so much as it takes on the atmosphere of an organized crime family, of the terror that is just completely seething under the surface, and comes up like pus out of a boil when heated. The Russian underworld of London isn't too pretty, and rivalries are settled often with the slice of a throat by a shaving knife (as happens towards the beginning of the film, and later on in a graveyard, put to a splendid jump-cut to an accordion player), with the members initiated through specific tattoos on the torso and knees. And when the most unexpected happens, like a terrible rape/pregnancy/birth via a 14 year old girl, the repercussions could be even more severe than a murder rap. I loved getting immersed into the nature of the people, of the violence, the threat of it, the joys submerged with lots and lots of vodka (it could be a stereotype, but then what would a stereotype be if it weren't true in the ugliest form), and at the same time always outsiders to British society.",2007
6,"Entertaining and absorbing film that grows more diffuse as it goes on, and builds to an unsatisfying conclusion that doesn't jibe with the atmosphere of extreme fealty and violence so effectively developed during the first hour. The climax is a lot less explosive than anticipated, and the film's resolution short changes two of the film's most interesting and superbly acted characterizations, Krill and Semyon. The climactic scene involving the baby and Krill is almost laughable. Looking at times like a combination of Kirk Douglas and Frank Gorshin, Viggo Mortensen is fine, says little, and possesses a commanding stillness. The rest of the cast is first rate, and Amin Mueller Stahl as Semyon and Vincent Cassel as Krill are outstanding. The film contains well-written scenes with convincing dialog and character development though Noami Watt's character(Nancy Drew vs. the Russian mob) and the narration from the dead girl's diary begin to seem obtrusive.",2007
9,"Two words: Viggo Mortessen. He is the man who will be watched comes Oscar time. His performance is a marvel to watch as he combines his physical acting in combination with the ability to develop characters from deep inside, showing complexity rarely seen in American films. Viggo plays a man who is in employ of a Russian godfather figure. He has developed close ties with the son of the patriarch, though the extent and nature of this relationship remains unclear throughout the film, we know that there is a bond will play an important part throughout the film.",2007
2,"I got interested in this movie after watching Oscar nominations, getting recommendations from friends, and listening to an NPR interview with Viggo Mortensen. Well, the interview was much more interesting that this parody of a movie. I struggled through the first 30-40 minutes, and then could not bring myself to watching it to the end, so whatever I say here is based only on the first part.",2008
9,"David Cronenberg brings this brilliant crime drama full of some quite phenomenal performances all around, namely Viggo Mortensen as a complex Russian mob enforcer again proving Viggo to be one of the most versatile working actors today. Naomi Watts was wonderful as well portraying a concerned nurse unknowingly digging into a waking nightmare until it was too late and Vince Cassel as the distraught criminal trying to hide his humanity.

6,"This movie is based on one cool gimmick: the Russian vory's culture of tattoos. Great. That too, is only explained in the extras on the DVD, but not clear to film-goer.",2009
9,"I walked into the movie theater with the ticket in my hand thinking about how many other movies I have seen like the one I am about to watch. ""Remember the Titans"", ""Stand and Deliver"", ""Dangerous Minds"", and the list goes on and on. And so I sat in my comfy chair that rocks back and forth so my back doesn't get stiff. Of course, my theater has stadium seating so someone's big head doesn't get in the way of my movie experience. And of course, I had to sit in the row with the railing in front of it so I could put my feet up, because I wasn't going to be uncomfortable while I play critic for this movie...what are you, crazy? Then, the movie began. and it ran and I was quiet. I laughed a little and cried a little, but not for one second was I criticizing. As I saw the characters go through their horribly troubled lives and while I was reminded of little Anne Frank, I became somewhat guilty about silently complaining that I got the squeaky seat or that my friend ate all the popcorn five minutes into the movie.",2007
2,"i was a freedom writer (10th-12th) and i was so upset with the over dramatized nature of this film. as i watched this film, the first weekend it was out and also glad i didn't waste my money to fly to the premiere, i was jaw dropped at all the untrue happenings. as to not spoil this film for people who are willing to waste their hard earned money on it i won't tell you everything but just watch knowing that what you are seeing has very little to do with the truth. anything even remotely good that happens in the film that doesn't include ""gang warfare"" and then becoming ""bff"" is never even mentioned of. i was almost sick in the movie because of the lack of truth. my husband knew of all the wonderful opportunities i was given in that class and he was disappointed as well. my husbands mother went with us, as she wanted to see a movie about the class she had heard so much about, and she was touched yet curious about how i turned out so well. so i guess if you know don't know anything about this class or it's students , especially the ones who weren't in a gang or were thugs, you might think that this movie is very heart warming. unfortunately you are going to be very mislead",2007

10,"This film was terrific! Very good! The acting by everyone, especially by Hilary Swank, was great. If you are in the mood for an inspirational film than you should go see this film. It puts you in a really good mood and makes you feel great! 'Freedom Writers' was filled with drama, humor, and more. It was a really nice film and a must see. 'Freedom Writers', has something for everybody. It is a film that people will love no matter what and who they are. A++++++ **** Go see this great film! It will literally set you in a good mood. P.S. It will probably make you cry so bring that special tissue box used for whatever your tears need!",2007
6,"The true story of a young teacher, Erin Gruwell played by Hillary Swank, in an inner city school who learns to be a better teacher by inspiring her students to be courageous, happy, and to see the error in their violent ways by teaching them to express themselves through writing. A touching and socially important message that has unfortunately been told millions of times before and was unable to bring anything new to the audience watching it. We are only truly touched by this story when we are reminded that it is based on actual events, otherwise it seems like old news that has been pumped out over and over again by Hollywood.",2007
8,"Immediately upon hearing about this film, I thought of Dangerous Minds. This made me hesitant to see it, thinking maybe it was just another retread. However upon learning that the film was based on a true story, it made me more interested in seeing it.",2007
1,"So many reviews here I just want to add a few points. First, allow me to qualify, I am a LB Wilson graduate and attended K-12 in the LBUSD. LBUSD was integrated a very, very long time before this teacher taught for a few years. That aside, it is racist to assert that integration had anything to do with the problems at LB Wilson. It was my experience that integration enriched my experience. The problems asserted in this film were fictional. LB Wilson is ofter referred to as the ""gem of the district."" It is a great and beautiful HS in the Belmont Heights neighborhood (which is adjacent to Belmont Shore). So this ghetto theme they were passing off is a lie.",2011
9,"Films about our educational system have been moneymakers from The Blackboard Jungle, to Up the Down Staircase, to Stand and Deliver and now Freedom Writers. This film and Hilary Swank's lead performance in it have an honored place among those previously mentioned.",2007
1,"Why is everyone so vocal about this formulaic trash? Let's think a moment: What drives the film ""industry""? Okay, we know it isn't the public welfare. You can rule out innovative plots, too. The truth doesn't carry any weight, either. Must be... Anyway, when something re-hashed, pre-chewed, and half-digested comes out of Hollywood, just follow the money trail. Hilary Swank is ""hot"" this week, so she has to do the ""serious"" film to keep the public satisfied with her minimal talent, because the trailer says so. So go see ""Freedom Writers"" (god, I love that title!) and listen to the Oscar buzzzzzz... Idealistic teachers will get weepy at this movie, because it speaks to their self-image as underpaid martyrs, while impressionable teenagers will buy into notion that minorities are unable to help themselves without a white savior to do it in public schools. This film falls right in the middle of the tried and proved Hollywood path, and in the same ruts.",2007
9,"This is the latest in a long line of ""teacher features""  ""Good-bye Mr Chips"", ""To Sir With Love"", ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie"", ""Dead Poets' Society"" etc. In these films the teacher is the hero or heroine, often coming to some disadvantaged school and taking over a class dismissed by the timeservers as hopeless, and producing sparkling results. The strength of this movie, which is based on fact, is not so much in the performance of the ""heroine"" teacher (which is all one could ask for) but in the focus on the pupils themselves. They come from such disturbed backgrounds from the Long Beach, California, of the early 90s it is a wonder some of them are still alive, let alone at school. Many have lost brothers and sisters in gang warfare, been abused by police, mistreated by their parents and generally neglected. But when Erin Gruwell (Hilary Swank), provoked by the manifest racism in the class, gets them to write about themselves, their attitude changes from surly distain to an eagerness to learn.",2007
10,"What a great beginning to 2007 to see this tremendous film, THE FREEDOM WRITERS, with a stunning performance from Hilary Swank and a cast of young men and women who make you ""cheer and cry"" all through the film for their stories and their personal journeys. And what a timely film to come out in Los Angeles when our mayor has recently gone to the Feds and asked for more money to handle the intolerable gang issues in Los Angeles.",2007
9,"I wanted to see this movie because I knew it would most likely be good, because most movies I saw on this subject before were pretty well done. It surprised me, because, in my opinion, it was actually better than the other movies I saw that were similar. The fact that it is a true story was one thing that made it stand out in the beginning. There is also the way The neighborhood, and school is portrayed, because it is very accurate to the time it depicts, showing the war that was going on, and the real struggles that the students had to deal with on a daily basis. The movie was so real, because it was true to the way high school students act, and the problems they faced, not putting a facade over anything to water down the truth, it shows what really happened. The actors in this movie did an amazing job. Hilary Swank led the way with a cast of not as well-known actors, who stood out and graced the big screen with their talents of conveying the truth. They added to the success of the movie, and helped develop the theme of education, and how it can really help people, and that it isn't just some cheesy plot in an inspirational ""teacher"" movie. It was so real that it stirred up emotions in everyone at the theater I was at, and I am not a person who cries at movies, but this movie made me feel like crying. There are such intense moments, and so many messages, and truths brought out in the movie, that it is really eye opening. It is a reminder that a little effort can make a big change. I would recommend that people go see it, because it is a very well done movie with a brilliant storyline.",2007
1,I cannot believe that movies like this are still being made. Shame on all the bloody bastards who wasted money to make this awful propaganda film.,2007
1,"once again Hollywood has decided to do a portrayal of how terrible these poor minorities have it at their terrible public high schools. oh whoa is me I have to come to this run down high school every day and i hear gun shots when i lay my head down on my pillow at night, insert hip hop montage of your choice in center of movie, with some of the students out gang-banging but the hard working students of (fill in the blank) teacher are inside working on their writing skills so that someday they may have the opportunity to attend a good college and lift themselves out of this horrible situation. i can just picture every single minority based education cliché possible somehow seeping its way into this bull$hit picture, was Gridiron Gang, Finding Forrester, Coach Carter, Dangerous Minds, and 187 (Im sure I've missed about fifteen hundred others) not enough???",2007
4,"This earnest, highly drab retread into the teacher-overcomes-odds-in-a-tough-school routine is hard to criticize for the unabashedly inspirational slant the writers try to ingrain on their audience, yet is harder to recommend to any cinephiles over the age of twenty due to it's heavy-handed derivative nature. Nothing at all is even attempted to be reworked for this updated, and far less gripping piece of educational uplifting, akin to quintessential ghetto-teacher film Stand and Deliver, and youth appealing Dangerous Minds. Freedom Writers tries to take what made those movies appealing, relevant, and inspiring, and instead synthesizes a two hour after school special with a dash of grit thrown in to mark the studio release.",2007
2,"American Pie: Beta House is sort of in limbo between genres. On the one hand, it's a comedy with no plot and few genuinely clever jokes. On the other hand, it's porno that's a tad too soft-core to actually turn on any viewers. Essentially Beta House is a collage of sex scenes - some humiliating, others just lame attempts at humor - with a couple thin plot points thrown in an effort at cohesiveness. The characters are barely even two-dimensional, most development relies on knowledge of Naked Mile, and the ""important"" plot scenes are so far apart that you wonder why the writers even felt the need for a story.",2009
3,"Although it's an R rated movie, I really doubt that you'll really enjoy it unless you're a teenager",2007
7,"I have to hand it to the creative team behind these ""American Pie"" movies. ""Direct To DVD"" typically is synonymous with cheap, incompetent film-making. Yet last year I was pleasantly surprised when I found myself thoroughly enjoying the DVD sequel ""The Naked Mile"". The filmmakers took advantage of the opportunity to deliver a raunchy, yet funny little film. This year they offer up the followup, ""Beta House"". This is the honest truth, ""Beta House"" makes the first few ""American Pie"" movies look like ""The Little Mermaid"".",2007
7,"This movie is plain fun.I has nothing to do with the original America Pie, but it is fun to watch.",2007
1,"I don't usually register and make comments. But this Movie was so lacking in everything I had to watch it all the way through, to make sure someone wasn't playing a sick joke.",2012
7,"Wow, this was another good spin off of the original American pie, not as good as band camp, but definitely a lot better the naked mile. Dwight and Erik stifler lead the comedy in this one, but I actually preferred the dialogue in this one to the naked mile. The script was written a lot better and the comedy flowed more smoothly, however most of the comedy came from sex, but that's okay because that's why we watch these movies anyway right? ",2008
3,"Stifler, has finished running his naked mile and is now attending Beta House. Crazy stuff happens, people run around naked and nerds are made fun of and this series is dead in the water. The Naked Mile was a crap film, but I found it to be significantly better then Band Camp. It seems they've gone back to what didn't work for them and it shows that they don't care either. You can tell where the target audience is and they nailed it perfectly. Young teenage boys who like to see naked women, crude humour and beer drinking will love Beta House, everyone else can pretty much look away.",2008
8,"Ti%s and As*, lots of boobies. Some great characters, fun filled pranks and well put together teen action in this spin off of the Amercan Pie franchise. This feels like really OLD SCHOOL. It feels a bit like Porkys for the 2000's. Some great funny characters combined with some very humorous situations make this one a real surprise for me.",2008
5,"Well American pie beta house is not you're Hollywood Box office smash The movie goes straight to DVD and the old cast from the previous American pie are back. The story line is not the best but it is not the worst even with that I still found my self enjoying this Film Beta house is mainly for college kids and people with a good sense of humor, Based on silly tricks,frat house,drinking,a lot of nudity, not for you're Average thirteen year old. If u can get passed the weak storyline and u kinda like the idea of kids going crazy at college u will love this movie. This is not a family movie don't let you're kids watch this movie",2007
7,"i just watched the movie i was afraid it's gonna disappoint me. i was rather surprised at the end though. The American pie franchise is still in my favorite franchise movies of all times. yes, it won't be true if i say that i enjoyed it as mush as i enjoyed the original ones. beta house along with the previous two pies definitely lost something that the first two pies had.it is not gonna become a classic as the first two already did. but what the hell-it is still funny with a lot of good moments and i think it should be the first movie to pick if you wanna have fun and relax after a hard day at work or school. beta house deserves 6/10 but i gave it 7/10 just for being another slice of PIE.",2007
2,"Why do they even try? I mean, come on, how long they think the whole ""Stifler"" hype will last? Just stop it! It's not even funny anymore, it's just sad...",2007
2,"For starters, I would like to say that I'm a fan of the American Pie series. Even though 'the naked mile' and this one are the two worst, this one seems to be the downfall of the whole series.",2008
6,this film is a good entry to what has a become a very popular series as you may or may not now this is a sequel to the naked mile. it takes place one year after the events of naked mile and it now finds Erik going to the same collage as seen in the naked mile and Erik gets the chance to live with his cousin who is still the ladies man and is basically Steve stifler but in collage and they have to go up again the evil geeks. There are some funny bits in this like when Erik first goes in to his dorm room he sees his roommate and his girlfriend together Wesley the drinker always drinks way to much and can never remember the night before. overall this is the best entry since the American wedding 6 out of 10,2008
9,"* Firstly, although many say it is the worst of the series, i don't think that it is true,considering this one ideally reflects the 21 century teen mentality .it brings perfect opportunities to make you laugh and remind you of the good teenager times when you would have liked to have same fun as the characters do.",2008
10,"Funny, sexy, hot!!! There is no real plot but you needn't anyone...",2007
5,Great movie made for the teenager. It's not for the younger nor older.,2007
1,"So, American Pie: Beta House is the 6th American Pie movie in the series. Although, it really has nothing to do with the original three American Pie movies except some of the characters are supposed to be related to the characters in the original trilogy and Eugene Levy is in it (can't that guy get better gigs?).",2008
2,This was the worst film i have seen for a long time. ,2008
9,This is by far one of my favorite of the American Pie Spin offs mainly because in most of the others the main character (one of the young Stiflers) always seems unrealistic in nature. ,2008
1,"Considering how boring ""The Naked Mile"" was and how bland and unfunny the characters were, who in their right mind thought it would be a good idea to do a direct sequel to what was arguably the franchise's worst entry?! Really? Did anyone really care enough about the lame Stifler cousins and their dorky friend to warrant another film about them? If they insist on killing the American Pie series with all these direct-to-DVD sequels, at least keep doing different movies with different characters. ""The Naked Mile"" was so disappointing that I held out hope that maybe the next one, with hopefully better characters, setting and story, will revive the series. But no. Instead they made the mistake of picking up where the last one left off. This one's even worst than the last. Forgetting that the Pie films are supposed to be sex comedies, the writers forgo the comedy part entirely and focus on the sex instead. Yes, children. If you see enough breasts you won't notice that the cast has no talent and the movie has no script or budget. Nothing new is brought to the table here. No attempt is even made to bring anything new. It's sad considering ""Band Camp's"" admirable attempt to bring the original theatrical film's mixture of comedy, gross-out humor and endearing characters to the made-for-DVD series. It may have not fully succeeded but at least it tried. The same can't be said for the abortions known as ""Naked Mile"" and ""Beta House"". The only good thing I can say about ""Beta House"" is that at least actor Ross Thomas had the good sense to stay away from this one.",2007
1,"For those with little time on their hands, I'll sum it up quickly, in one word...pathetic. There are a lot of good examples as to why this movie fits perfectly under that description. So much so that you can barely go through 2 minutes of screen time without seeing something completely stupid and pointless forced upon you. Want a fully naked woman in the first 10 minutes? You got it! The reason she appears is so pointless though that it really sets the tone for the rest of this piece of juvenile crap. You can almost glimpse into the deluded minds of the 12 year old boys that wrote this piece of garbage just by watching this crap that they expect the public to actually pay for!!??!!! ",2008
2,"OK so there's nudity, but hey, there's free porn on the internet for whomever likes it. And its just silly how they forced tits into every frame. I mean i was embarrassed, not from the nudity but from the far-fetchessness of the producers/writers of this piece of crap.",2008
2,Let's cut to the chase: this movie is softcore pornography marketed for the masses under a name that the studio is milking every last penny out of the American Pie teat. Period.,2008
2,"Aside from the fact this film is a complete rip off of revenge of the nerds, it fails to even come close to being funny at all. I liked the first three American pie films and the naked mile was quite good, so I was thoroughly disappointed when I saw this film. Its a tale of irritating frat boys doing moronic things and it didn't make me laugh at all. They only praise I have for this movie and that is the female nudity that seems to be used for no reason. Its jokes are unintelligent and there is no character development at all. At least the other American pie movies have a good story line and funny jokes, but this had neither. If you like retarded movies with soft-core sensibility's, I recommend you see this film.",2010
8,Now I love American Pie 1 and 2 while 3 was great just for Seann William Scott's performance as Stifler but after that the quality has dropped. Band Camp kept the standard reasonably high with characters you actually cared about but Naked Mile was the same joke and plot- lines recycled (Erik Stifler's sex problem is like Jim's). It had some amusing moments like the Football game against the midgets and the 'punishment' of Coozeman but on the whole it lacked originality and the 'Mile' was just stupid and moronic. Not to mention the irritating girlfriend who doesn't want to have sex. ,2008
10,"At last a sitcom that you can just sit and laugh at. Benidorm has some great features. It does not try to be clever. It is not political and certainly not politically correct. It is not sexist, by which I mean it does not make the male characters out to be more stupid, feckless, or inept than the females. Most of the characters are grotesque to some degree, and yet all are likable and are played by excellent actors. Good comedy is not easy to do - re the depressing list of hopeless sitcoms scattered across TV history.",2008
9,"A refreshing new comedy based on the typical average Joe's holiday abroad for the past 30 years - a week in Benidorm. Why did nobody think of it before? Up to date themes are used to great effect. Including a gay twosome, a married couple who's action between the sheets has run out of steam and a middle-aged couple of unlikely ""swingers"" who unashamedly recount their exploits in graphic detail. It would be interesting to hear how paying holiday makers at the Los Pelicanos Hotel fared whilst the TV crew took over parts of the complex for filming last year. Regular Benidorm holidaymakers will recognise much in this series of programmes. One commentator has remarked that the show loses something from barely straying from the confines of the ""all in"" deal at the hotel. But I would suggest that this has been done to contain costs. I once wrote gags for BBC TV and was more than once ticked off by a script editor for including too many characters or setting in my sketches.",2007
7,"I am really pleased that this programme has been created. The comedy is based on a bunch of holiday makers in the same hotel in Benidorm, the show follows them with their goings on during their holiday, which in some cases leads to trouble. What I like about the show is that it is not completely based on a few main characters, there are quite a few characters that star in the show, and I really like the casting of Jonny Vegas 'the oracle' who provides much laughter along with the other characters. This is a comedy which in my opinion suit those audiences who enjoy seeing characters making fools of themselves as you might find on a real holiday. I however think that the show could be improved in the fact that it spreads only as far as the hotel area for the entire show. I would like to see the characters wonder into the town and get into trouble as well as the hotel. However I would definitely recommend this programme as it is a real good laugh.",2007
5,"I used to love Benidorm, I have been a viewer of it ever since it first started with the very first series back in 2007. The first 5 series have been really good and funny with proper entertainment. However ever since series 6 up until the very latest series 8, I feel that the show is going to pot. For starters, the Garveys are no longer in it and the jokes from the other characters are about as stale and dry as the sand that surrounds the pyramids of Egypt. The show just feels dated these days and I seem to keep seeing the same old faces around the swimming pool and Neptunes. By ""faces"" I mean the extras in the background; series 6, 7 and 8 all appear to use the exact same people in the exact same locations! Someone needs to sack the guy who's in charge of the extras and bring some fresh faces into those scenes. In particular there is a middle aged couple always used for the pool scenes and also an older gentleman with a silly towel around his neck. These people must actually live by that pool in real life! I know I am not the only one who has spotted this over the past few years, people just don't seem to be making much effort with the production anymore. Also the SAME Solana establishing shots are being used year in year out too that are nothing more than recycled clips taken from the older series (some appear to be from before series 5!) they obviously cannot be bothered to shoot new establishing shots of the Solana and its just plain laziness. I know its a comedy but you still have to do everything properly and be professional in this day and age. IF there is indeed a series 9 or even series 10 in the pipeline then I really do hope these problems are fixed and sorted otherwise I can see itv giving up on this show and it will end up being on Netflix or YouTube as an ""exclusive"" or even worst just a direct-to-DVD like you get with many of the low budget films these days.",2016
8,"I remember going to Spain with my family and living Benidorm, don't get me wrong this is not for everybody, but there are many people out there who can totally relate to this. And I don't believe things have changed that much, I think the values nailed in this series are relational to today's audience. Well represented and every stereo type covered and then some. Highly recommended to all who lived the Costa dell sol life or anybody who wants the real fly on the wall experience of Brits in Spain. This isn't about factual events; this is entertainment, with so many people with so many issues on so many things. I don't think there has been anything quite like Benidorm before and I don't know why? So if you're looking for some mindless entertainment that steps back in time to when Spain was Spain, then look no further.",2008
10,"What are you talking about? Who is Jonathan Vegas? You mean Johnny Vegas(stage name)? He's from Lancashire,NOT Liverpool!So you can't be that much of a scouser to not be able to tell the difference between the accents! The only scouser I've seen in it was Margi Clarke! Who is Telle?? And what has anything on Benidorm got to do with Manchester vs Liverpool? Chip on your shoulder methinks! The programme is great,warm fun. Very down to earth and hurtful to no-one! I suspect the one hour episode may be shown at Christmas and I,for one cannot wait,especially as it features lots of scousers being abused by the evil Mancs!LMAO! Really,allyno3,I hink you need a map of England and a sense of humour!",2008

1,series has gone right down the tube. some of the new cast are really bad actors. script plots are very thin and predictable and most of all very unfunny.i am not alone in this opinion a lot of my friends said the same. get rid of the scriptwriters and get some new blood in .cheers,2017
7,"Most Britons prefer to spend their summer vacations in Spain, Florida, or elsewhere. In this series, a mixed group of families spend time at an unusual resort in Alicante, Spain. I only caught one episode on a flight so I don't have the luxury of seeing the other episodes. It appears to be the second season opener with the same family arriving to the Spain resort, a couple who allows her husband to carry all the luggage and makes a gruesome discovery about her parents. I love Janine Duvitsky and remember her fondly from Waiting for God as plain Jane Edwards. Here, she is the complete opposite. Sheila Reid plays the grandmother with a new boyfriend who prefers to wear short and tight bathing suit. Anyway, the families arrive and remember what happened last year. While the premise needs work, the cast appear to be having a ball away in sunny Spain.",2008
10,"""Benidorm"" is a wonderful,true,touching and hilarious portrait of the British abroad.These folk are not ""Europeans"",they are Brits,proud,bloody - minded,funny,sharp and generous with everything but money. Noticeably short of jolly cockneys,the programme concentrates on folk from that mythical area north of Watford where few of us southerners dare tread,Lancashire. Determined to have a good time they have plumped for an ""all - in"" package holiday at a Benidorm hotel that seems stuck in a 1980s parallel universe. All human life is there.With its glorious vulgarity,its desperation, its misunderstandings,deceits,hopeless hopes and large and small tragedies. The writing is spot on,the cast incomparable,the characters as real as your friends from the pub or factory. If I pick the Garvey family for special mention it is because they are closer to being a real family than any other I've seen in even the most prestigious productions. Also outstanding is the brilliant Mr J.Vegas and the sublime Miss A.Cruttenden. Forget any patronising criticism you may have read,""Benidorm"" tells you more about Britain and the British in the 21st century than a dozen TV documentaries or the entire ouevre of the fashionable Mr Loach and his companions in condescention and it's gloriously rudely funny to boot.",2012
6,Benidom is a series that is absolutely not political correct. Even though the characters in this is a bit of a parody of Spanish and British people it does indeed hit most of humankind right between the eyes. People in this series does not behave like the brightest minds on earth. But if we are honest how often do we experience that in the real world? You will laugh with and of this lucky bunch that is on a All inclusive Hotel in Spain.,2010
10,"I have never been to Benidorm but a lot of people in my workplace have and love it. This programme shows the best UK stereotypes ever, people who pay 200 quid for a week 'all in' and make sure they get their money's worth. Whenever I have had a hard week at work, I watch this as it never fails to cheer me up. Every character has their charm, but the sarky wit of the previous manager Janey is a joy to behold so is the karaoke at Neptunes. Sad that the actor who played swinger Donald is no longer with us . The Middlesbro' branch of the Swingers Association will miss him. Btw Sticky Vicky's daughter has taken over her act for real and still displays the flags of all nations and all that !",2014
5,"I am an American and the English-language translator for a Spanish novelist who lives in Benidorm and works in the hotel industry. I have visited my friend four times and I think I know Benidorm fairly well, though I have never stayed in the type of hotel depicted in this series (all-inclusive), nor is it the type where my friend works. I wanted to see this series, but it was not coming in on BBC America, nor could I get it from Netflix. When I tried to buy it from Amazon.uk, they couldn't ship it out of the country. I eventually ordered it sent to an American friend working in the UK and then he shipped it to me. I can see now why the Brits don't want this show seen outside their own country. It shows only the worst type of British tourist, the kind my British friends try to avoid when they travel. (Many Americans are just as bad.) They are crude, vulgar, obnoxious, and if it weren't for captions, I couldn't understand the dialect. Now, having said all that, I have to confess that I've had some laughs. I'm sorry there is only one Spanish character (and he's a stereotype), because I really like Spanish people and I'd like to see more variety. My conclusion is that it's not as bad all the time as it is most of the time.",2012
8,"I saw a sold-out opening night screening of ""Across the Universe"" last night with a group of my friends who had really been looking forward to it. Many of them were extremely disappointed, while in the critical world, Roger Ebert and the New York Times loved it. Because the film was so highly anticipated, and a number of people have asked me how I liked it, I'm writing this review in an attempt to express why the movie is so divisive. I'm not going to talk about plot, or describe any of the numbers. If you're interested in seeing the movie, they'll be more enjoyable if they're unexpected.",2007

10,"I have been anticipating this movie ever since I saw the trailer on IMDb like everyone else. When I first saw the trailer, I said to myself, I'm either going to consider this my favorite movies of all-time, or it's going to be trash. Being a huge Beatles fan and owning all their albums on CD, I had huge expectations about the covers of the songs. I saw it with my friend, who is also a huge Beatles fan but not a huge musical fan. Both of us saw it on opening night to the public and to our surprise it was really good! The covers of the songs were actually really good! Now don't get me wrong, the original Beatles songs will always be the best versions but for what they did, they did a pretty decent job. One of my favorite scenes was the ""I've Just Seen a Face"" bowling alley scene. So creative and fun! Also the ""I Want You (She So Heavy) scene wasinterestingbut fun to watch. Eddie Izzard's scene as Mr. Kite was hilarious! Both me and my friend where on the floor laughing. Also Bono's scene singing ""I Am the Walrus"" was great. Don't listen to the critics that say that ""it doesn't do the Beatles justice"". Actually, it's the opposite. Any hardcore Beatles fan will appreciate all the jokes that were thrown in there. Even if you're not a hardcore Beatles fan, you will appreciate the fantastic love story.",2007
9,"Pure emotion. No one can mix theater with film like Julie Taymor. From beginning to end the film takes you on a psychedelic beatle ride that grips you by the ears, the heart and the soul and never lets go. Even now. Hours after the projector was shut off. Every song adaptation interpretation and setting is spot on, fans of the Beatles will recognize that every detail in Taymor's images recall an instance, a photograph, a line or a quote from the band. Even the girl that comes in through the bathroom window. Nothing is left to chance, everything is on purpose. Amazing. Easily the best film of the year. And in regards to people saying it's a two hour music video.. well... yeah, what the heck were you expecting???",2007

Your timing could not of been better! You helped me to remember the fervor, passion and idealism that made up the mid-late 60's. It's been many years since I have burst out sobbing in a movie theater! Thanks for helping to lift the fog a bit! As an activist, you have collectively given me some badly needed renewed vigor! ",2007
9,"Across the Universe is a love story and musical with creative interpretations of Beatles classics. Critics looker for deeper meaning seem to forget this simple fact. Incredible cameos by Joe Cocker, Bono, and an earth-shattering Gospel version of 'Let it Be', are all in themselves reason enough to see the film. I was lucky enough to see this recently at the historic Elgin theater in Toronto. Julie Taymor is one of the most eloquent directors I've heard to date. Not only has this film advanced the art of film-based musicals, it will most certainly get the Oscar nod and introduce a legion of new young fans to the Beatles. I for one can't wait to see and experience it again!",2007

7,"A phenomenal feature length video clip with the Beatles songs and Julie Taymor's eye at the helm. The story, of course, is wafer thin but who cares, right? We're not here for intellectual enlightenment but for the forceful, visionary, smart ass style of one of the female filmmakers that has already revolutionize the Broadway stage without, really, changing anything. I believe that's the kind of revolution that leaves a sign. The kind that reassures rather than confuse and ""Accross the Universe"" does just that. The Beatles are reassuring their message is reassuring. Little did that generation know that things were going to take a terrifying turn. Love! Love! Love! All You need is love. Still true but we've never been, as a society, so far apart. It was great to see teen agers humming the Beatles tunes coming out of the theater. The lyrics are like Gospel or lullabies. Was it only yesterday? It feels like centuries ago. The innocence seems foreign and at the same time so real. It will be nice to go back with the experience of hindsight. It doesn't work like that, does it? No, I'm afraid not. In the meantime the great Julie Taymor gives as a beautiful reminder. And a lovely evening out at the movies.",2007
1,"There has been no greater disservice to the music and spirit of the Beatles than 'Across the Universe': an over-emotive, glitz-laden, ham fisted vehicle for a talentless group of unknown 'actors' which should only be viewed by film students as cautionary tale of what can happen when ego thinks it can adapt and improve things that that are already perfect. I wonder what on earth was going through the head of Ms. Taymor - a normally talented director of stage and screen and the mastermind behind the overlooked film adaptation of Shakespeare's 'Titus Andronicus' starring Anthony Hopkins and Jessica Lange.",2007
1,"I have never wanted 2+ hours of my life back more than I did when I saw this movie. Everyone I know saw it before me and, after all the hype, I couldn't wait. I'm a huge Beatles fan and thought the idea of a Beatles musical would be awesome. I mean, hey, Cirque did it with Love, and they succeeded. The movie had to be good, right? Wrong. I wanted so badly to give it a chance, but within the first half hour I could tell that the plot was severely lacking. Characters like Prudence were horribly underdeveloped; you could've taken her out altogether, and the only thing that would have REALLY changed would that you couldn't include ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" or ""Dear Prudence,"" and speaking of the former, that number was just one of the many examples where in the movie, you'd think they were trying to lead up to something, and then they'd drop it altogether. They included random and stupid things just so they could use a few more songs, and why do people buy into this crap? Because they're too distracted by the music to care.",2007

""Visually, the most creative movie I have ever seen,"" said my dad. So I went ... ",2007
1,"Oh, have you seen ""Across the Universe""? (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0445922/) Are we the only ones to find it bad, bad, REALLY bad? I think there's an odd syndrome--I've seen it before, can't remember where--of 60s-and-Beatles-infatuation among people who were born post-60s-and-Beatles, and they seem to take ownership of the 60s and Beatles music in a way that is often extremely distasteful to me. Besides the codification of the 60s into convenient chewy clusters (one character drafted, another one black, a girl ""too"" involved in the anti-war protest movement , another in the club scene trying to sing like Janis Joplin...), in this movie, it appears they tried to build an entire plot around the 60s and most of the dialog out of (sung) Beatles songs. To me, as soon as you start naming characters ""Jude,"" ""Max(well),"" ""Prudence,"" ""Sadie,"" ""Lucy,"" you're already losin' me, kid. When half of those characters are ONLY there to support an occurrence of one person or another breaking into song (i.e. ""Prudence's"" whole raisin-bran d'etre in the ENTIRE movie was to have a scene where she's shut herself in a closet pouting and everyone outside the closet sings ""Dear Prudence,"" now THAT's just stupid. They shoehorned songs into the plot, and plot lines into song-ops. The one English guy always sings with a smile on his face and everyone has these pure, clear (let's call it ""plear"") voices fresh out of ""Fame"" (they were born after THAT, too, I think). WAY too many telegraphed references to well-known Beatles and 60s trivia, like the use of apples and strawberries and the comment to Max about killing grandma with a hammer. There are a few cool animation bits (well, one, really), but ALL of that might not be too bad, but they ALSO had to bring my man Jimi into it! Now they're making me mad. The characters are zero-dimensional. The acting is out of Junior High, rising only occasionally to Sophomore level. The writing is just execrable. I had to watch it through because these are my heroes from, and this is the soundtrack of, my youth, and frankly I couldn't tear myself away, just like that reporter and the Hindenberg--""Oh the humanity!""",2008

1,"Wow. My teen-aged son recommended this movie to me. I expected crap, but this went far beyond my expectation. The oh-so-pitiful storyline. How to tell you? Trying to tie Beatles lyrics together, like a concept album, with some clown who looks like Paul McCartney...and the most ludicrous symbolism I've ever seen. ""She's So Heavy/Carry That Weight""... astounding. See, a team of US soldiers walks the jungles of Viet Nam carrying The Statue of Liberty. The soldiers reminded me of Egyptian slaves, building the pyramids (in Hollywood movies, anyway), which my mind received as The United Slaves of America. Surely, that's not what the film-maker intended. Surely, we were being prompted to remember that 'Freedom isn't free'.",2009
4,"The first time I watched Across The Universe, was in Toronto International Film Festival.

1,"This movie had little to no transitions, was extremely melodramatic, contained mediocre at best Beatles covers that sound like they should be on a two dollar Christmas album at Wal-Mart. Save your time, people are raving how great this movie is but the funny thing happens to be that all the people that are so in love with it are also billionaires that can waste money on a daily basis. In most films fake British accents don't bother me all that much but after twenty minutes of ""Across The Universe"" I was ready to burst into tears. I think it was best put by a simple man of our time and he says that ""People today are still living off the table scraps of the sixties. They are still being passed around- the music and the ideas."" Bob Dylan (1992)It's far too true, everyday I see a teenager wearing an already faded Abbey Road shirt, America is dying due to the fact that every child claims that classic rock bands like The Beatles are the ultimatum to music and that they are individual because they listen to a band as complex as The Beatles this anticipated release of ""Across The Universe"" was merely a trip across your dad's LP collection except with bad vocal talent and little pictures to look at, if you're really in the mood for ""The Beatles"" go get an actual Beatles album and enjoy.",2007
1,"I had high hopes for this film. I love Julie Taymor's work--Frida is great, Titus is simply magnificent. Across the Universe, however, is simply one of the worst films I have ever seen. The reworked Beatles tunes are bad. Just bad. I cringed every time a song started. Their use does not translate as clever to any degree. Instead, the application of the songs feels terribly contrived. The plot is utterly uninteresting. I felt in now way personally invested. Perhaps because the characters are not well written. Perhaps because they are empty clichés, testament to a watered-down, unimaginative impression of the time--an endless stream of iconic clowns. There were two good scenes, the draft scene and the trip scene. These were classic Taymor moments, beautifully and grotesquely designed. Unfortunately, five minutes of excellence do not make up for the painful experience of sitting through the rest of the film.",2007

I looked around and saw people looking at their watches. Im also not a huge Evan Rachel Wood fan. She was fine in the movie, Im just not crazy about her acting. The gentleman who played Jude was excellent. I found him to be adorable and funny. He also had an excellent voice. I also felt it to be kind of...out there. If you watch the preview, you already have a taste of what I mean. Some of the moments in the songs were kind of abstract (personally I enjoy that in small doses but she did use it quite a lot throughout the film.) Over all, this move was good, and I think that everyone should see it.",2007
1,"This movie starts out pretty good for the first 20 minutes or so. The first hint of strangeness is when the cheerleader begins singing I wanna hold your hand' sung from a distance where she longingly sings about the head cheerleader.

10,"I haven't gone back to pay for and see a movie two times in one week since I was a kid...which is close to fifty years ago. I was definitely a part of the sixties and perhaps that had a lot to do with why this movie had so much appeal. I also used to write for television and I must say that what these people (Revolution studios) put together was sheer genius. The way they told this story falls right into what is most important to me when I go to the movies nowadays...SHOW ME SOMETHING NEW!!! This piece was such a breath of fresh air, so brilliantly done by so many people that I'm thinking about going back yet again with my daughter. If you were a part of the 60's, loved the Beatles or were influenced by their music, or if you just want to see some phenomenal performances in a beautifully told story...Do not miss this film.",2007

8,"One way to get the most out of Funny Games is to have your expectations open before watching it. It's not a standard horror film aiming to fulfill your needs as a viewer. It's about horror films and us, the audience who gets pleasure from suffering as entertainment. It shows what real horror might look like in an awful situation, and how it psychologically debilitates and paralyzes the people involved.",2009

In it, a group of people are stuck in an elevator that has come to a dead stop, presumably because the presence of the devil is in with them.

3,"Naomi Watts and Tim Roth play a couple being terrorized by two very annoying murderers in Funny games. And to tell you the truth,watching this movie is it's own form of torture.

6,"When I heard Michael Haneke was re-making Funny Games in America I wondered why: what purpose could it possibly serve? The set-up to both versions is simple in that a bourgeois family is subjected to a torturous ordeal by a couple of ever so polite psychopaths. Moreover, like the original the re-make is a cruel exercise in exposing our fascination with the violence depicted in the media - the ""our"" specifically meaning the middle classes, comfortable in our existences and oblivious to the horrors of the world. ",2007
1,I'm afraid I learned nothing from this movie. It isn't a smart satire on the detached upper middle classes and how they put up a gate between themselves and the violent world outside. It isn't a dark comedy of manners. It's really just a slow paced slasher movie promoting and celebrating mindless violence for entertainment. It has about as much social significance as I Know What You Did Last Summer. I particularly despise the use of killing a child for nothing more than shock value. If you are distracted by the art house aesthetic and use of cinematic and audio editing techniques and don't agree then I'd like to present the classic horror/slasher/suspense scenario for your consideration. ,2008
1,"I knew there was something seriously wrong with this film after about 5 minutes of the home invasion. I knew that I was rooting for the family to crush the excrement that the antagonists were. I also suspected that my wish was not going to be satisfied. I turned off the movie well before the first of the family members were murdered, and found my answers here. I will never watch another second of this movie again.",2009
3,"Back in 1997 director Michael Haneke made Funny Games, a  disturbing and thought-provoking thriller that toys with the viewer's  place as a voyeur. In 2008, the re-make, also directed by Haneke,  debuts with an all new cast and this time in English. The problem is  that it is essentially a shot-for-shot, line-for-line, verbatim  re-shoot. This makes watching this film pointless if you've seen the  original, or unnecessary to watch the original if you're planning on  seeing the 2008 version. And despite those pesky subtitles that often  upset American audiences, the original's authenticity and casting is  surprisingly superior.  Anne (Naomi Watts) and George (Tim Roth) arrive at their vacation home  ready to enjoy some golf and sailing with their son (Devon Gearhart)  and neighbors. As Anne is unpacking groceries, she is confronted by two  young men, dressed in golf attire, and wearing white gloves. Thinking  nothing of their politeness and harmless asking for eggs, explaining  that the neighbors ran out of cooking materials, Anne immediately helps  them. But when the two boys begin obviously antagonizing her, she  realizes that their family is about to be taken hostage for a  terrifying night of anything but ""funny"" games.  The same opening overhead shot of a car (this time an SUV) driving down  a desolate highway while the family inside plays a game of guessing  opera tunes, opens the film. The same opera pieces are used, the same  title sequence and the same ear-piercing abstract death metal. The film  is undoubtedly disturbing, unique and white-knuckle suspenseful, but if  you've seen the original, there's nothing new. The breed of dog  changed, along with the style of phone (from mobile to cellular), but  the house's white gate looks almost completely identical, and the  kitchen and all of its seemingly random decorations are all a perfect  match. Georg and Anna have been altered to their American counterparts  George and Anne, and some of the original translations have been  reinterpreted (such as fatty to tubby and cheeky to rude).  What makes this remake only slightly more successful than Gus Van  Sant's famously horrendous turn with Hitchcock's Psycho is that Funny  Games was never that well known. Taking what many believe to be one of  the greatest films of all time (Psycho) and re-doing it scene for scene  is so utterly pointless, it's a wonder the idea was ever even carried  out. At least with Funny Games the reasons are more coherent. Making a  German film more accessible for American audiences through the use of  English speaking actors isn't entirely inane.  Devoid of an omniscient soundtrack and played out to feel like  real-time, the events of this one freakish night is quite a  distressingly entertaining ordeal. Regardless of the superiorities that  are evident in the original, this version isn't without its shock value  and thought-provoking commentary on voyeurism and violence. But with  its unexpectedly appalling conclusion, bizarre plot twists and the  unexplainable interference with the ""fourth wall"" (a.k.a. having  characters talk directly to the audience), Funny Games may very well be  a film that could never have been truly accepted by American audiences  in the first place.  - The Massie Twins",2008

The plot is that two young men take a mother, father and son hostage whilst on vacation in their cabin and force them to play sadistic 'games'. As the film progresses the different types of 'games' become more violent and horrific. The one major, and biggest fault in this film was the slow pacing of certain scenes that took literally twenty five minutes.",2008

There really is nothing else here.",2009
8,"The masochist side to my personality saw both versions of Michael Haneke's ""Funny Games"" and like them. Well ""like"" may not be the right word but let me tell you that I couldn't shake those images out of my mind for days. It happened the same with Haneke's last film ""The White Ribbon"" as well as with ""Cache"" and in particular with ""The Piano Teacher"" I'm fascinated by Michael Haneke but I don't trust him. I'm aware of his brilliance just as aware as he is. There is a self consciousness about his work that strips it of any form of innocence. That's very disturbing. Luis Bunuel felt triumphant when people fainted or vomited during his films but, in his case, it was clear where he was coming from. Ingman Bergman's purity couldn't have allow him to do a film like ""Funny Games"", Haneke made it, twice. An artist or a con man? I think both but that in itself is not that unusual, what is unusual is that the con is so rivetingly perpetrated. The ending of his film may provoke in you the desire to throw something at the screen and curse, curse very loudly. But, and here is where the con really works, I found myself wanting to see his films again. What's wrong with me? I think the answer is that I love film and Michael Heneke revisits some of my favorite filmmakers and does to them what the home invaders do to the family of ""Funny Games"" Extraordinary in as many ways as it is appalling. ""Funny Games is considered, by some, to be Michael Heneke's most commercial film, isn't that funny?",2009

Apparently this American version of Funny Games is a shot-for-shot remake of the original, but with different actors and in English. Also, before seeing this (a year late, as us Australians get most films later) I had read plenty of articles and reviews detailing how dark, powerful and disturbing Haneke's film was. Well, they were damn right. This is a brutal and abrupt film, with no happy endings in sight throughout the majority of the film.",2008

If u want my advice DO NOT WATCH this junk. it had nothing at all, acting was horrible, plot was the worst plot in Hollywoods entire history and above all, the two jerks who where screwing that STUPID family are just jerks and did nothing else but jerking around.

9,"I don't understand the hatred towards this movie. I saw the original version a few years back and found it to be an entertaining and captivating movie. The American remake of this movie is identical (with a few updates for technology), and English speaking actors. I think the problem with ""thriller"" and ""horror"" movies these days is that we're so accustomed to the shock and gore that a psychological thriller is lost on most people. I think the experience of really putting yourself in the character's shoes is what really makes a movie, and this is what this movie delivers. If you found your ultimate moment of joy from watching Jason Vorhees take out a couple of campers you've never seen before while having sex, this isn't going to be the movie for you. This is an exercise in how people behave in an unexpected, awful and shocking situation. This is how real people react when but into a crazy situation. This isn't running and screaming deeper into the woods pursued by a madman. This movie delivers stress and chills, which is what horror truly is. There is no happy ending, there is no hero. Such is life. Learn to deal with it.",2010

And yes I have seen battle royale and the running man, and yes this rips them both off fairly liberally, but what the hell, an action flick is an action flick, enjoy it for what it is. And Vinnie Jones is great as the super evil bad guy. And it even has some social commentary about the media's influence on our culture. Granted, its heavy handed and obvious, but seeing as I was expecting a movie on par with a Segal straight to DVD flick, any level of intelligence is appreciated.",2007

7,"Hey, this is not going to test the gray matter but if you want an entertaining albeit violent movie to fill in a few hours this is not a bad choice. The plot is predictable but the main saving grace is Steve Austin as Jack Conrad as he comes across as a compassionate and somewhat likable hero who ended up in this predicament by trying to do the right thing for his country. He does not exactly have to stretch his acting muscle but you do end up hoping he will win through. Although much of the violence is not right in your face in parts it does carry on that bit long although this is used to separate the ""no morals, no borders"" team from the good guys within the production cast. This movie serves up exactly what it promises but is still an entertaining movie. I would recommend to a friend.",2007
6,"At first glance, the storyline looks like a distant cousin to the Japanese movie Battle Royale.

8,"We were really surprised when me & my friends watched this movie; it was really the best WWE movie ever, taking into consideration that we all don't enjoy wrestling, but we gave it a try, as it was thought to be as ""Battle Royal"", not a wrestling movie, & in fact, it surprised us all. All the acting was excellent, especially Steve Austin & Vinnie Jones, & surprisingly sometimes emotional acting was there even from the male characters!! The plot was so simple but extremely good (for a WWE movie!), also the shooting was very fine. I recommend you watch this movie, especially with a group of friends, you will be very surprised & will have a lot of fun !",2008
6,"One has to bear in mind that The Condemend is wwe production so don't go expecting some massive work of art with lots drama, action and a deep plot that will make you think- NO! Since it is a WWE production with wrestlers that have belonged to that company it has them doing what they do best in their specialised field of entertainment. The plot in nothing too out of this world if you have seen Battle Royale then you shall understand the point but it is by no means a great movie like Battle Royale so be warned. However having said that it has got all the ingredients in it to keep fans of the action genre connected and the story just picks up and moves on at a good pace with action to keep you hooked in. Steve Austin was good giving what he had to work with although to be honest it did not really need any effort as this role is a mirror image of his tough guy persona in WWE , however it was funny watching try to play the silent tough guy who grunts quiet a bit! But the star of the show in my opinion was the proper English hard-man Vinnie Jones , he was entertaining! The action was great along with the over the top theatrics which we see in the WWE . My complaints were that it drag on a little longer than it should of done I mean it was filled up in a few dull moments between fight scenes which were not needed and a few parts which tried to show that the characters had depth - that was just silly. To conclude , The condemned is not nearly as bad as people are making out to be, its merely a time pass and it should not be compared to anything bigger or deeper like Battle Royale however if you would like to see it then make sure it is on one of your boring Monday nights. Fans of the action genre and WWE will be left feeling satisfied to a meek extent as it is not that bad but could of been better.",2007
6,"The concept is simple: 10 vicious felons are put onto an empty island and told that the last one standing after 30 hours will go free. To make their efforts to kill each other, weapons have been stashed in various places around the island. To make the effort pay itself off, the organizer of this event is airing it over the internet where viewers can subscribe and watch the mayhem. Naturally one of these felons is actually a good guy who's wrongly in prison.",2008
4,"Some of the other comments are way too harsh. This movie isn't trying to be the next Fletch Lives. Don't take this movie too seriously and it's mildly entertaining. The fight scenes are too choppy and tough to see and the plot is predictable, but Steve Austin is good. He has the same deadpan expression and delivery throughout and it works. The rest of the cast pretty much phones it in. A lot of these actors look familiar. Like you have seen them before, but you can't quite place them. If you like WWF, then you will probably be satisfied. I saw an afternoon show with about 15 other people and only a couple were asleep at the end. Better than Marie Antoinette.",2007
10,"The Condemned is one of those movies that you know right off the bat is made for one specific type of audience. If you like reading Jane Austin novels and sunsets and walks along the beach and romantic movies then this movie may not be for you. This is all out balls to the wall action movie that does not apologize for what it is. Premise is a reality series producer is putting together the ultimate survivor series on the internet. He picks ten people from the worst prisons around the world and buys them from death row and attaches a bomb to their ankles. The Bomb will go off in 24 hours the catch is simple only one can win. It's a fight to the death the prize is you get your life your freedom and a big bankroll. Trapped amongst the sadistic killers is Jack Conrad (Steve Austin) a former Navy S.E.A.L. who was recruited to do black ops types of jobs his last one went bad and he was caught in El Salvador awaiting death. All Conrad wants to do is get out of this alive and go home to his girl. But Conrad is decent man with Honor and a code of principles that will not let him take part in this sadistic game so he tries his best to survive and get help. Steve Austin does a good job in his first film As lead actor and he's gone on to make better films since his role in the EXPENDABLES is much better and you can see Austin has grown as a actor, This movie is worth checking out if you are a fan of this type of action flick. Better then Van Damme's hard target and Rutger Hauer's The game, This movie does deliver good entertainment.",2012
4,"""The Condemned"" has a very straightforward plot. It tells the story of John Conrad (Stone Cold Steve Austin) who is purchased from a Central American prison. The buyer is a TV producer named Ian Breckel who has purchased 9 others just like Conrad; mass murders who are awaiting death penalties in their respective prisons. Breckel has the idea to transport these 10 ""contestants"" to an island near New Guinea where they will fight to the death, the last remaining person after 30 hours will be set free. But there are catches, all contestants have an ankle brace that carries multiple C4 bombs that will explode if the tag is pulled out or if the 30 hour time limit is up and not 9 other contestants are dead.",2007
3,"I just went to see this movie and was very disappointed that I spent money on it. The movie is very predictable. The acting, what acting? Steve Austin, needs to stick to wrestling. The other characters were almost blank sheets. The only other ones they even tried to develop were the producer and his main assistant. The cinematography is very lacking, they could have used steady-cams in a few places. The violence is extreme and repetitive.",2007

4,"American Variation on Battle Royale except in this film those put on the island, squared off against each other, with bomb locks around their ankles, are adults(..mostly those with a criminal past awaiting Death Row). Stone Cold Steve Austin is a black ops federal special forces agent, Jack Conrad, who was infiltrating a drug cartel when he was caught and imprisoned in a Central American jail, bought and placed into the death tournament on a reality internet game. Vinnie Jones is a psychotic former special ops guy himself, McStarley, his was for the British government. The collar bombs have a trigger device that will go off if another competitor presses the button. Those handpicked to compete represent various countries, and only one can survive with the prize being their freedom. The corrupt mastermind behind the whole operation is Breckel(Robert Mammone), who looks like a self-absorbed Harvard grad with an insatiable desire to exploit a selected few to reap millions from those craving real violence..he wishes to ""put on a good show"" by manipulating his audience establishing heroes, villains, and the weak victims who are unable to outlast the stronger, more savage foes. We watch as the ""condemned"" fight for survival, trying to outwit each other, as weapons are parachuted to McStarley, and his temporary Japanese partner Saiga(Masa Yamaguchi)purposely by Breckel so that they can gain an advantage as a strategy to make his show more thought-provoking and gripping. What Breckel doesn't expect is how intelligent, resourceful and cunning Conrad is, and how he'll set his sights on getting even with ones responsible for placing him in this difficult, dangerous situation. Breckel underestimates Conrad and an even bigger problem develops as his base camp operation is not too far from the action. Also a sub-plot is those searching for Conrad's whereabouts and attempting to pinpoint where Breckel's operation is located.",2009
4,My first post so forgive me if I mess it up! ,2007
1,"This movie started out with a few interesting scenes, and then shot through the floor and buried itself in horrible film-making. The fights are all shot close up and shaky, along with obvious punch pulling and uninventive deaths. Very quickly the numbers drop and you find yourself having to go back and count to even notice how many are left. The dialogue is terrible, with a message about violence hidden in it like an elephant behind a hot-wheels car. Its an unoriginal story, and its got so many plot holes I can't even pretend they get answered. It's going to disappoint even Stone Cold fans, because he could have torn people up so much better, and it will disappoint regular movie goers with its sub-par story, and worse storytelling. This movie is not what you are expecting it to be, and I strongly urge you not to spend your money on it when that same money would be better spent buying a stun gun and buzzing your head for an hour and a half.",2007

7,Simply put - if you like action films you'll enjoy The Condemned. ,2012
3,"It is natural to expect that a product of WWE Films would be hard-hitting and action packed. But when the audience cannot properly see and enjoy the action, the end result is disappointing. WWE Film's latest production, ""The Condemned"", offers bountiful opportunities for action fans to satisfy their hunger. But due to the poor directorial work, it becomes a tease. Even the star power and fan following of the film's lead (former WWE wrestler Steve Austin) was not enough could not save this debacle. ""The Condemned"" is one big mess that leaves the audience wondering what was the crime they committed to deserve this sentence.",2007
7,"As an independent movie, The Condemned kept me interested in the characters, and the actors delivered, especially Mr. Vinnie Jones and former WWE Superstar Stone Cold Steve Austin. Compared to the original Battle Royale, its not as graphic, not as exciting and doesn't catch your soul and shakes it like the Japanese Battle Royale did.",2007
9,"This movie is definitely the best movie that the WWE has put out to the public. I got it through my mail account just as a whim, not expecting much from it. I was really surprised how well this movie was put together. The plot is strong: 10 people, who are all on death row for various crimes, are brought to an island by a rich man. The objective: be the last person standing in 30 hours and you will be set free. The entire ""game"" is broadcast over the internet. The characters are very well casted. Steve Austin makes a great lead character, while Vinnie Jones (Juggernaut from X-men 3), and the many other characters create a real sense of danger and desperation. I would definitely recommend you do not pass this one up. It can be a great movie to watch alone, but is more fun to watch in a group. If you're in the movie store, pick up a copy. You won't be disappointed.",2007
4,"I saw this movie expecting a bloody and gory action movie. But there wasn't much real violence or enough action. The fights were way too choppy, they pretty much have cameras on several angles and constantly keep jumping camera to camera and you can hardly even tell who's winning the fight. So let me get into the plot and try not to give much away.",2007
9,"The movie kept me engaged, entertained and questioned the premise of media gone too far. Vinnie, Steve and Rick were great and the music made the action come to life. The Asian actor was entertaining and the moral questioning by the producers woman and Rick Hoffman kept things real. I wished there was more questioning of the Iraz war or any violent act.",2007
8,"Wrestlers tend to achieve success mostly within the squared circle, some use that circle as a way to jump into other forms of entertainment such as TV and cinemas, not many succeed. Dwayne Johnson seems to be an exception to the rule as he has proved himself as a great action star and has good range. Since then the WWE has been trying to jump start other wrestlers into the spotlight through their own movie studio, WWE Films and their box office results show that movies starring WWE wrestlers are a tough sell. It's understandable, it's hard for anyone, outside the wrestling scene, to take a movie starring a wrestler, seriously. But fan or no fan, nothing stops you from checking out this movie. Personally I've seen all the WWE Films made so far, See No Evil was a fairly good horror movie(it also happen to star one of my personal favorite wrestlers, Kane), The Marine ,on the other hand, could have so much better if the director wasn't so busy trying to figure out what story he wanted to tell in The Marine. The Condemned turns out to be the best of all the three movies so far. For those who don't know, The Condemned is a story about 10 convicted felons who must fight to the death in a remote Pacific island and the last man standing walks away a millionaire by the production company who streams the event to all Internet-paying costumers, making it a genuine bloodsport/snuff film, bombs are attached to their ankles and are set to explode within 30 hours, they also explode immediately if they are tampered with(yeah,it does sounds a little too much like The Running Man or the Japanese thriller Battle Royal). One of the unlucky convicts is no other then Conrad, who is played by the Texas Rattlesnake ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin who tries to find a way to escape. As soon as all of them are dropped on the island, a survival games begin, people are stabbed, necks are broken, profanity abounds and women get violently raped while Ian Brecklin watches this mess delightfully even when being reminded by some of his co-workers that he crossed so many lines ethically and morally. Also in the meantime, the FBI is working hard to track down the website source while in another part of the US, Conrad's girlfriend is suffering for his absence. The movie has a nice kick to it, it's got truckloads of action and gun play, well enough to quench the thirst of action fans, acting is acceptable, considering the cast is made out of mostly newcomers and some established B-grade actors(Vinnie Jones, who plays a deranged British soldier who rapes women just for fun, was seen recently in X-Men 3 as the Juggernaut. Note: His terrible line from that movie: ""I'm the Juggernaut, b****!"" still echoes in my mind. And Nathan Jones who has gotten roles in recent Kung Fu movies such as The Protector, aka Tom Yum Goong). Stone Cold plays a part he's most accustomed to, a foul-mouthed trouble maker and I can't say his range is the best, but much like Kane in See No Evil, this movie suits him just fine. The action is featured through quick cuts and always moving camera, it makes it's more energetic and adds more suspense but it also makes people feel a little dizzy, it has become fairly common on lots of movies today, but in the case of Condemned, it works, kinda off. They could've been less shaky, that's one complaint. The moral dilemma in the movie is also fairly well-played and it focuses on a popular urban legend subject, which is snuff films. How far will you to be entertained? What are the standards in this area? What and where are the boundaries? Though the movie is sorta sending a mix signal, because we can look at it as this way, the movie's a giant mess of recorded violence and it's telling us in a way not to see it...but OK, we get the message: people who watch convicts killing off each other deserve some form of moral judgment, or so one of the distressed reporters says so(millions of people paying 50 bucks to watch live murder...what a scary though**shudders**). The movie also doesn't paint alternative media(such as blogs, message boards and chat rooms) in the best light as the villains pretty much use them to generate awareness for their pay-per-view show, again scary. The Condemned is pretty good for all it's worth, it doesn't need a complicated plot, it delivers the bare essentials as far as action movies go, perhaps closer to the ultra-violent movies of the 80's and 90's then what The Marine was trying to accomplish. It's also far more mature then The Marine, some scarce one-liners is pretty much all the humor you'll find in this movie. Give it a chance, it's worth seeing it in the movie theaters at least once.",2007

2,"The general formula for getting a new movie recognized in America nowadays tends to be by means of a clever gimmick or craft in advertising and hype (Cloverfield, The 300, etc.). Teeth is an interesting addition to this formula, as it is a B-horror movie that is generally marketed to an indie comedy audience. Iif you're interested in seeing it it's almost guaranteed you know what it's about before walking into the theater. Unfortunately for Teeth, it manages to give you just that and absolutely nothing else for 90 minutes, and I mean that in the worst possible way:",2008
9,"If all you know about 'Teeth' is the premise, you probably think it's a typical B horror film. In fact, this movie is very good and very fun. I don't mean so-bad-it's-good, I mean good.",2008
6,"The trend of imbuing horror films with a quirky sense of irony cribbed from the hell that is adolescence (think ""Ghost World"" with gore) may have finally run out of steam with ""Teeth,"" a moderately impressive (though unspectacular) yet overly precious and self-aware stab at subverting the genre's gender roles. Writer-director Mitchell Lichtenstein's concept (a puritanical virgin who grows up next to a nuclear power plant discovers a mean set of incisors below the waist when her sexuality blooms) is intriguing, and some of the film's best moments possess a surreal quality that almost transforms the material into a metaphorical extension of Dawn's (Jess Weixler) awkward adjustment to womanhood. While much has been written about gender roles in the horror genre, ""Teeth"" cleverly manages to have its cake and eat it, too: Dawn is treated as a haplessly naive girl by every male she encounters; the males are predatory, would-be rapists. In films like ""I Spit On Your Grave"" and ""Ms. 45,"" the female victims recover to enact revenge in an extreme manner--""Teeth"" playfully subverts Freud's notion of ""penis envy"" by transforming male genitalia into a literal kiss of death; Dawn's encounters (while tinged with a sometimes groan-inducing, ""Clueless""-styled humor) eventually contribute to her growth and maturity as a woman, to the point where she finally becomes master of her domain. While not great, ""Teeth"" is a worthwhile little sleeper with some food for thought.",2008
7,"In a small town nearby a nuclear power facility, the chaste Dawn (Jess Weixler) is raised with her dysfunctional stepbrother Brad (John Hensley) by her mother that is sick and her stepfather. Once in high school, she participates of a meeting called ""The Promise O"" that preaches purity and virginity for the members. When the newcomer Tobey (Hale Appleman) arrives in town, the naive Dawn feels that he is her soul mate and stays close to him. The proximity becomes attraction and Tobey does not control his hormones and forces Dawn to have intercourse with him in a cave in an isolated lake. However, he is castrated by her vagina and vanishes in the lake. The desperate Dawn runs to the library and discovers that she has the mythical ""Vagina Dentata"" and only a hero can rescue her.",2009
7,"The premise alone can speak for the originality of the movie. Most audiences will be rushing to this film out of sheer curiosity, I know I did. While this movie is graphic, the conflicting tones of horror and comedy give it a playfulness and a freshness that any true movie-lover could appreciate. Now, its not by any means the best movie ever or the funniest or most horrific but it shines its light. The story and characters are all cheesy/campy but thats what gives this movie its charm. Its almost like whats going on is so absurd and awful and awkward you have no choice but to laugh! I don't recommend this film to the faint of heart but if you are in the mood for something new and will keep you talking for weeks, then I say this is the film for you. If anything, just to say you saw it is quite enough for most people. Women, you'll appreciate it more than you think. Men, you'll be more careful out there in the real world.",2008

There can never be enough room to make fun of these 'abstinence-only' folk who wear the ""Promise Rings"" and are amid a self-made desensitized cult that, in essence, dissuades those who do have romantic connections from giving in to their desires.

Along the way it found it's own -admittedly- intriguing to mesmerizing hybrid of style between social satire, coming of age and teen splatter...yet avoiding the pitfalls that each of those genres might have had. It is a strange, maybe estranging experience to watch - but what do you expect from a such a topic of ancient horrific myth ? All in all an entertaining experience.",2007

Hard Candy some psychotic chick makes a guy jump off a roof and hang himself and in Teeth 3 guys lose their privates and a doctor looses 4 fingers. In the end I was left feeling like this girl, with teeth where they don't belong was not genetically superior, but really a mutant freak. I mean OK the first guy was actually doing something wrong, but the second guy? Oh I see, he didn't love her so he should just get castrated. And the last guy should die because of your mom dying.

I would think this would be something that goes straight to video, but I guess someone thought this deserved more and brought it up from the depths of B-movie'dom.

Danish drama 'The Killing', for example, is only pseudo-naturalistic: it's highly manipulative, and, if you take all of its plot twists together, as risible as any other story where one death magically leads to a chain of others to keep the story alive. But it's also the best thing I've seen on TV for years. Over twenty episodes, those plot twists actually come pretty slowly; the drama treats its audience like adults; there's some highly absorbing interplay between a police investigation and political circles (as in the later series of 'The Wire'); and above all else, there are some of the best characters I've ever seen in a TV drama. The lead parts, Lund (Sofie Grabol) and Hartmann (Lare Mikkelsen), are especially good (and in a strange way, not altogether unlike each other): neither is a conventional hero (or villain), neither is even particularly personally likable, but you still will them on. But the lesser characters are no less absorbing; and even the guilty man is still plainly human, although as episode twenty throws up a new and surprising twist, one can't be altogether certain what he is guilty of. Few other programs have left me so entranced; if the second series keeps this up, it will be a true great.",2011

Chills go down my spine if i think about my mothers addiction of these kind of series, like Columbo, Agatha Christies franchises, Bergerac and the like.

But this is a roller coaster ride for 20 episodes, at least the first 12 ~ 14 episodes they feed new clues so an other person of the fixed cast becomes the main suspect.

10,"It's hard to find superlatives about this second season of Forbrydelsen which eclipses the first story by some distance, and those of you who were gripped by Sarah Lund in the original Danish drama will welcome her back to Copenhagens homicide unit after spending a couple of years checking passports in Gedser.",2011
10,"Just watched The Killing ll and felt that I just had to say how much I enjoyed it. Really fast moving with lots of political intrigue mixed into the plot. Very believable with excellent choice of actors, music and photography. Since I came across The Killing l by chance on BBC4 I've become and avid fan. I Like the update's at the beginning of each episode to remind you exactly where it left off last time though sometimes I just can' wait to get to the episode itself. I love the plots which are really well interconnected and only ever gave you glimpses of who it might have been. Both series have kept me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end. Let's hope the BBC get more of the same (do they exist?) Just excellent 10/10",2011
7,"I watched all episodes for 3 days in a row so you could say I was immersed in the story, unfortunately that's when the huge plot holes also become very apparent. I found myself saying quite often ""why would they do/say that ? It makes no sense at all !"" The 2 detectives wrongfully accuse someone almost every day based on nothing else but a hunch or ""evidence"" that could point to the whole population of Kopenhagen, I hope the real Danish police has more sense. I still don't understand some of the subplots, for example : why did the police chief have to leave, what was he covering up when there was nothing to cover up ? Why did the murderer do what he/she did ? He/she gives a sort of understandable explanation at first but why rape and beat the girl to dead ? Why take her to the woods, how did the murderer get home, how could the girl have lost so much blood, how much can a politician endure in 2 weeks without suing the whole police department, why why why .. Acting is not bad although the female investigator is a stubborn annoying woman, she sometimes pulls a face, the camera zooms in but for no apparent reason ? And what is up with those hideous woolen waved pulls she wears, I mean I haven't seen those since the eighties ? The mother of the dead girl also suddenly turns into a labile crazy woman, they probably needed a reason to show the grieving parents ? On day 19 one of the boys has a birthday and they are singing and everyone is kinda happy but only 3 weeks earlier their daughter of 19 was brutally killed .. I mean, if this were to happen to you I don't think the grieving would be over after 3 weeks right ? It could have been so much better if they'd cut the episodes in half, one of the other reviewers already said it : you can skip day 2 to day 14 because they have almost nothing to do with finding the real murderer, they are subplots of unlikely suspects. Surprisingly though I knew after the first episode who was the killer and where he/she kept the girl but that's because I suspected the most obvious person to be the killer, I'm certain that in real life the killer would have been caught the day after the killing .. I give it a 7.",2012
7,"Absolutely gripping, just as the first serial was. Anyone who thought that a sequel couldn't be as good was wrong. Sophie G goes from strength to strength as Lund. I wish she was in every scene. Her trials and tribulations, her stubbornness, her penchant for rushing into scary situations in the dark - all these things are brilliant and keep me glued to the screen. I particularly love the moments when a little tinkle of music indicates that she has a brainwave. As for her scenes in the final half hour... I dare not say more for fear of spoilers.",2011
6,"Watching this series was often exhilarating and involving, but around episode 6 I began to tire of so many gratuitous red herrings, which created a too-predictable pace. ""Ah, now we suspect HIM...but there's too much time left...so it can't be him!"" It think the story would have been stronger if it had been shorter, or else less predictable.",2012
10,"Friends had told me about their surprising find of the Killing - people who don't normally talk about TV or movies with me. I should have realised then. I watched a bit of Series 2, was impressed, but wasn't really paying attention. Then with a free Netflix account, I found Series 1 and started watching it and just finished #20 a few days later (well I did have work to go to!). I've read many of the reviews on IMDb today and I agree with more of them than any other movie/show on here.",2012
10,"This is one of the best series I have ever seen. No small feat with some superb TV series coming out of the US recently - Dexter, the Good Wife to name just a couple. The fact that this is a Danish subtitled series is no hindrance to enjoyment. It seems to add to the atmosphere, which never lags.",2012
10,When the first series of 'The Killing' started on BBC4 nobody guessed that this Danish crime thriller would take off like it did; by the time the third series hit our screens we knew to expect something special; the question was; would it be able to deliver? This series opens with a death in the harbour; the investigation quickly leads to the discovery of more bodies aboard a ship moored offshore. It looks as if this will be the main plot line of the series but then the young daughter of the shipping company is kidnapped and held for ransom. As the series progresses it becomes clear that the kidnapper has an agenda other than just getting money; he is determined that those he believes were responsible for a cover-up involving the death of another girl must pay. As with the first series this takes place against the background of an election; this time the election will determine who will be the next prime minister. Inevitably the politicians find themselves linked to the case in many ways; the girl's father is a party donor and more than one politician is somehow connected to the case the kidnapper is interested in.,2012
7,I'm writing here to balance the other submitters who are giving this series 9 or 10 stars out of 10.,2011
10,"very good script ,mystic atmosphere, very detailed physiological approach and not easily predictable! it is now released in Greece and we are watching the 8 th episode. The actress that has the leading role is so simple and realistic that it is a pleasant surprise for comparison with the overwhelming acting for example in a similar American production. actually all the actors are playing great. Watching something so different from the usual productions on TV is a miracle! The Europe has a different style for filming and it is obvious from the first episode .So if you want to try something totally different watch this.You will not be disappointed. Well done Denmark!",2013
10,"This movie ""August Rush"" really touched my soul. I was an orphan and identified with this child's yearning and searching for his parents. Near the end of the movie, I started to cry like a baby. ""August Rush"" touched something tender buried deep inside my soul seventy-six years ago.",2007
9,"I totally enjoyed this movie. The scenes have an appealing fantasy element, while at the same time, the plot manages to explore true-to-life human situations such as bullying of those who are different.",2007
10,"This is an urban fairy tale. If you go to AUGUST RUSH with the intention of poking holes in it, you can find little glitches and logic flaws. On the other hand, if you are looking for a movie that will sing to your soul (and show you some beautiful eye candy as a bonus), look no farther. The casting director and cinematographer should each get an award. This gem of a movie takes us on a journey, and the people we meet along the way are well worth the ticket price. ",2007
10,"If you love it, you'll LOVE it. If not, then the most you'll probably give it is an 'ok'. The movie requires the audience to have a somewhat willful suspension of reality as there are some slightly mystic themes interwoven in the storyline. But as the movie is basically centered on the power of music, the mystic elements make sense. It's completely about belief and faith in the intangible.",2007
10,"This is a fantastic movie. Well done. During our screening at a particularly tough part for the title character, I heard people in the theater say ""No, no..."" The level of ""buy in"" and suspension of disbelief is high. ",2007
9,"""August Rush"" is sort of a feel good, modern day fairy tale involving a parent/child separation and a boy's unrelenting search to be reunited with his parents. But the primary theme is Music as a healing force in the Universe that draws us all together. The film stars Freddie Highmore, as the orphaned musical prodigy; Keri Russell, as the sheltered cellist from Juliard; Jonathan Rhys Meyers, as the Irish singer/songwriter/guitarist; Robin Williams as Wizard, the street performer who takes August under his wing; and Terrence Howard as the social worker who works with the orphan boy and his mother.",2007
9,"I never comment on movies here, usually I just use this website to get an idea of what I am about to watch but I saw this movie last night and loved it. ",2007
10,"I saw a sneak preview tonight, not knowing anything about this film. If you still have an inner child, and an imagination that has not been beaten out of you by the ""practical and mature"" world, then you will love this movie. I wish I had taken my daughter. The only people that I have seen complain about this movie are people that probably consider playing music ""hard work and self-sacrifice"". If you don't play the cello, you are not going to notice how bad she fakes it. During certain scenes, I found myself sitting way back in my recliner, with my eyes closed, soaking up the sounds that inspired this young man. Not since ""Strictly Ballroom"" have I been so moved by a film.",2007
10,"I absolutely loved this movie during the free screening in San Francisco this evening. At its end, the film received claps, cheers and shouts of approval by the majority of the audience. The child actors were terrific, especially Freddie Highmore whose facial expressions alone carried more emotion than any screenwriter's words could. The music was amazing...the guitar work, incredible singing by young Leon G. Thomas III, and the gospel singers (especially Jamia Simone Nash). The blending of classical, rock and street-sounds music was phenomenal. The movie was funny, poignant and a tear jerker. Heck with realism...I'm more than ready for a little bit of magic in my entertainment these days! Great film for families with teenage children. Younger ones might be a bit frightened by, as someone else said, the Fagan-like character played by Robin Williams and the intro bullying. So this may be a film to rent on DVD to show the younger ones so parents can discuss scenes with them or provide parental oversight for your particular child. But no bad language, no visible sex scenes (although we do know it occurred), and overall a delightful film. I rarely if ever buy DVDs except for old classics but this will be one of the exceptions. Also, the soundtrack should be terrific. When can I see this again?",2007
9,"Firstly, being a fan of Jonathan Rhys Meyers I had been hearing about this project for a while and I couldn't figure out how they'd make sense out of it. It does end up making sense even if it's a little far-fetched. It's about a son and his parents who all have to find each other, but my problem was that I couldn't figure out a way they could have gotten so separated in the first place. But luckily the writers did. It's pretty sappy and sentimental but if you're not that kind of person, I can't imagine you'd be interested in something like this anyway. It's the type of story that always comes out around this time of year, which is also the most sentimental time of the year. It gives you warm fuzzies so if you like something like 'Mr. Holland's Opus' or 'About a Boy' or 'Love Actually' you'd more than likely enjoy it.",2007
9,"This was an absolutely brilliant movie. I saw it at the special premiere to the Grammy Recording Academy members a the WB studios in Burbank. It's an absolutely amazing story with a brilliant cast and a soundtrack that will blow you away. Apparently, both Freddie Highmore, keri russell,Jonathan Rhys Meyers learned most of the songs and played/sang them themselves, which is very impressive once you see the movie. John from five for fighting wrote a few songs on the soundtrack as well. Music is the common thread that keeps the entire movie together and completes it into the masterpiece of a movie that it is. Although at times, there may seem like there are gaps in the story line/character development, the point of this is that the music is what communicates those hidden details of the movie.Overall, this film is a masterpiece that should be cherished by music-lovers everywhere.",2007
3,"(*Spoilers*) Famous concert cellist Lyla has a one night stand with rocker Louis that produces a son Evan (aka August) who is surreptitiously sent to an orphanage by Lyla's controlling father because he believes the child may harm Lyla's career. After these opening scenes we rejoin the story when August is about twelve. Then the separate paths of the three protagonists are traced until their inevitable reunion. It would take more than a thousand words to detail all the preposterous story lines. Let's just consider a few. August is a musical genius who would easily put Mozart to shame: he becomes a skilled guitarist within the first hour of exposure to a guitar; he starts composing and notating a symphony immediately after being shown the basic scales; he can play an organ, complete with pedals and stops, on a first try; he is skilled enough to conduct the New York Philharmonic; in the final scene we come to understand he has a certain level of extrasensory perception. There are some equally absurd things that could be said about Lyla's story.",2008
4,"This movie was not really worth my time. The previews made it look significantly more coherent and put together, but the plot lines in this movie are all over the place, and the weak music score does little to tie it all together. Meant to be inspirational, the movie comes off as silly and contrived, and in parts laughable. Too many characters, back stories, and side stories are introduced and left unattended. The love story between Lyla (Kerri Russel) and Louis (Jonathan Rys Myers) is passionless and boring. Freddy Highmore, as the title character, is frankly creepy throughout much of the movie. And since the movie revolves around music and the fact that August is a ""prodigy"", more effort should have been put into teaching the kid to look like he knew anything about music or conducting. The score for the movie is merely adequate, as is the entire movie itself.",2007
1,Utter drivel. That is about all I can say about it. I have joined IMDb just to comment on this film. And I resent giving it even one star. There should be an option for no stars.,2012
1,"This is one of the worst movies I've seen. I signed up for IMDb especially to review it, because I think it has an incredibly high rating for the total rubbish it is. I decided to watch this movie based on that and I can honestly say it doesn't deserve it. Though I'm rather cynical I have enjoyed some 'fairy-taley' movies, but this one fails on every level. It has a disgustingly non-believable plot, a wholly indolent protagonist (actually the whole cast seems to go about with no commitment to the film whatsoever), an utter lack of any personality and a shallow treatment of everything. It is a film where music plays a very prominent role, and the soundtrack is totally forgettable. There many other good movies around, don't watch this one.",2012
2,"""August Rush"" gave us no rush. The story is filled with practical impossibilities necessary to the plot, such as the fraudulent adoption papers, or Evan/August/boy Novacek not being adopted before reaching the age of self-expression. Perhaps set as a period piece such inanities might have flown by, but even fairy tales have to ring true at some level. None of the interactions between Keri Russell and Jonathan Rhys Meyers make any sense. Terrence Howard and Mikelti Williamson are wasted as mere, inconsistent plot devices. Robin Williams seems to be making a different movie than everyone else.",2008
1,"I really feel a bit ill after watching this drivel. I am a singer in a cover band and a film buff and this hit me on both levels. I could not stop picking it apart as to its complete lack of reality.

3,"And this is why my will should be more highly regarded. What to say, other than that this is the kind of sappy, melodramatic garbage that's more fit for Sunday afternoon viewing on the Hallmark channel? Let's begin with the plot, which actually doesn't exist. The movie simply rambles aimlessly from one episode to the next, shamelessly invoking deus ex machina when needed. In some ways it feels like something Terry Gilliam might have made in his absolute nadir after downing bottles of fluoxetine.",2007
4,"(SPOILERS)---If it's even possible to add to this festering tripe of what is proffered to be a beefy movie) 'August Rush' should be called Aw Gold Rush. It's a little better than (and assimilates to)'Death to Smoochy' (also played in by Robin Williams. Not that this makes Mr Williams a bad actor, etc.) This movie gives me that same feel with some 'Pay It Forward' mixed in. The movie conveniently and carefully avoids depicting actions of certain characters as irresponsible instead rewarding and spares us the sordid details other than self-ascribed depression. I recall class-assigned required reading of Charles Dickens novels. The characters behave as high-minded persons who don't respond with common-sense thinking. They feel, but don't think , deep. After this love-at-first-sight, horny-tonight rendezvous... maybe it's just the music they hear---that mesmerizes all..yeah, it's the music's fault. oh, I loved the 'dueling guitars' and no one was retarded, just gifted. No scene to suffer for deliverance (from). I could go on how this movie is crafty, I mean crafted, why bother? ah, the striking resemblance of the primary duo to (is that Nicole Kidman? and Ray (what's-his-face)..oh yeah, Liotta) both younger versions decidedly of course, but damn it's almost like the clone machine was tweaked un-beknownst to us. okay ,they're not the real two; but that's in line with the gist of this movie. ***ROBIN WILLIAMS***, ***TERRENCE HOWARD***...are they really in this movie? funny, I thought anybody could play those parts. Well, I guess I'm not the classy-cal, new-age, old-school, happy-melancholy, techno-inspired type to swatch this movie. But my date said she liked it.",2008
2,"OK, so I was ready for this movie to be schmaltzy. I wanted it to be schmaltzy.

Now we get to see the old characters again, so finally all that time expecting with the ""filler saga"" has come to and end, this is the original Naruto, the hero's come-back.

10,"Its a great and amazing story to be seen. An outstanding feeling to view the characters, their lives, emotions, decisions, etc. The whole story as suggested, revolves around the main character Naruto. Shippuden means hurricane, that symbolizes the strength Naruto gains over the years of training. He is supported various friends, teachers and other characters who are even strangers to him. Being an underdog in the early years, desperate to be recognized, works harder than anyone. Due to certain internal powers, he creates magic every time, he is tested. By deeds, he shows the others the way to be chosen i.e., not by tradition, etc. but by your heart. Even the psychology behind the friends' behavior, enemy behaviors are explained in such a simple and emotional manner that you also believe that these things are bound to happen even with you in the given situation.

I do not know why it has a lower rating then one piece. it is definitely better than one piece. i am also a fan of one piece and i agree it is good and i am updated on its episodes but Naruto is definitely better than one piece or even bleach which I've watched. I know that there are quite some fillers but bleach has way too much fillers and a lot of them aren't even good. Many people think that it is a kids cartoon at a first glance but once you watch from the beginning . you are definitely going to get hooked.,2013

10,Masashi Kishimoto - the man who made a whole new world. I am watching Naruto almost 14 years and i can proudly say that it is in top 3 of movies that had the huge impact on me. A lot of people all over the world started following that 12 years old boy until now when the last episodes are going on. I want to write this as i had 14 years of waiting 1 week to get the new episode. At the time when i was a child i got some DVD discs from local shops (There were no mach of them in Armenia at that time) and i watched every episode more then 4-5 times. I even wrote down lyrics of openings and endings and then translated them for myself.,2016
8,"I'm now in 2014 and still watching! I grew up on it and it really does teach great values in it's story and the character development. Naruto single handedly brought me into all the other anime, such as Bleach, Death Note, InuYasha, etc. The story is truly original and so in depth it'll surprise you how far it goes. Naruto turns from punk to protector of his village throughout the years this show has been going on. This anime has it all: Romance, Action (OF COURSE), Great fighting scenes too, music is top notch and so are the voice overs. It's truly been an amazing ride and I will definitely miss it when it's gone, but it's gotta end sometime. To anyone new to this series: Get into it ASAP, you won't regret it!",2015
7,"Only reason I give Naruto 7/10 is simply because of all the fillers and the fact that the show just wastes too much time. We get 20 minutes a week and 4 of those minutes are just clips of past episodes in the form of something recalling the past and whatnot, and it is a waste of time. Another thing that ruins the show is the amount of fillers in the show. Just make a separate series and just let the main series move on with the plot. YOU DON'T HAVE TO GIVE US AN EPISODE EVERY WEEK IF IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE ACTUAL STORYLINE PLEASE. Only reason I gave this anime a 7 is because I just love everything else about this show.",2013
8,"Let me start with saying that the manga ""Naruto"" is phenomenal. Especially the last few chapters - they just keep getting better.",2013
1,"There is a analysis about Naruto Manga ending. I'll be honest here...i seriously hate the ending of manga. First of all i never thought that there would be a shoujo ending then secondly i always knew that there were so many shippers such as Naruhina, Narusaku and even SasuNaru(huge amount of them). In this situation i was kinda sure that kishimoto will give an open end because if he ended Naruto with either one of them the other party will hate the end so my safe guess was a non shoujo ending but when i read the last chapter, i was so much disappointed because of it. I never thought the ending of a great manga will be like Harry Potter but seriously Harry potter made sense but these pairings specially Sasuke and Sakura does not even make sense at all. Lets be honest, Kishi gave so many Narusasku hints then at the end showed sakura as a same 12 year old retarded girl who is really damn annoying, where is her character development??? She is the same fangirl of Sasuke as she was years before and on the top of that she does not even understand a man feelings at all and she does not have a slightest self respect. I wonder why she is in love with Sasuke!!! When she does not even know him properly. It was always Naruto who knew the real Sasuke so what Sakura loved about Sasuke was his face and his cool attitude. Come on!!! Why such a stupid crush is made official when Naruto's crush was not made official despite of hinting. Then comes the Naruto, who was head over heels for Sakura, all his life, and lets not forget his ninja way was to ""Never give up"" so eventually he gave up huh!!! OK at least here i can understand the logic of Naruto giving up because Sakura is an annoying retarded female who does not love Naruto but note that she has shown care about Naruto but not love so Naruto gave up and Hinata shows real love for Naruto but when did Naruto start liking Hinata??? For God sake Naruto hardly had a conversation with Hinata. Then the MOST IMPORTANT thing...YES SASUKE, Sasuke is an aloof guy who never shows his feeling and emotions and the only 1 who ever could understand Sasuke was Naruto, and Sasuke never ever showed a slightest interest in sakura in the whole series, he never even care for her in Shippuden and tried to kill her twice, even in the fight with Madara, he didn't care if she dies and clearly told that he is not interested in her then after the last fight with Naruto, Sasuke became a good guy but OK till 698 the story was AWESOME AND I WAS LOVING IT BUT NOT ONLY ME BUT EVERY SINGLE PERSON WAS LOVING NARUTO TILL 699 and 700 came and those chapters looked like its not Naruto anymore like its a fan service. Sasuke said sorry to Sakura, OK that's fine he said sorry to Karin as well but what the hell was that....Sasuke poking Sakura's forehead???? When did Sasuke became such a loving guy?? Its not the Sasuke that was in Naruto from chapter 1 till 698, its some other character or some one that fans wanted so where is Kishi's Sasuke??? And then to add salt to injury Sasuke is shown having a girl with Sakura???????????? This was the point where i wanted to bang my head really hard and i was regretting ever reading Naruto manga. I was so disappointed and here my first and greatest love with anime ended and now i am not going to watch Naruto ever again. Just one last thing i want to say to Kishimoto is that instead of making any pairing it would have been so much better if there was none at all because every one know its not a shoujo manga. If the ending was open then surely there would have been a little fuss like why there was no pairing but i do believe that no body would have ever hated it that much. Giving it a blasted shoujo ending broke the hearts of many people.",2014
1,"I don't even know what to say. It just ended so badly that I'm speechless. Everything was too rushed. Anybody who has the nerve to say that it ended with 10/10 ratings is the stereotypical type of viewers with no taste for movies. Just saying. Don't waste your time. Naruto suddenly became a romantic show, I can't understand that. ",2015
7,"Naruto and Naruto Shippuuden is very inconsistent. They put so many 'fillers'; episodes that are not in the manga, episodes that they put just to make the series longer.

The shippuden series is much more intense and has a good story line but it also follows with the deaths of major characters like Jiraiya, Asuma and various other ninjas. For a little while kakashi, hinata, shizune and other ninjas are also killed but are revived by pain the former akatsuki leader who switches sides before dying. The story is also interesting and the major characters like shikamaru, choji and various other ninjas like Genma are shown more often and play a bigger role in the series.",2012
10,"Naruto, a simple, sometimes daft, but very caring person who would give his life to save his friends. This series I have watched from the beginning, to see this little guy turn into a full blown shin-obi in such little time. Now he is learning to use his inner demon called the nine tailed fox. A demon which was sealed into his body when he was a baby by his father to save the hidden leaf village, and also, so other shin-obi nations could not attain the power within. Yet as he grew up, he was ostracized by his own people, and classmates when he entered the shin-obi academy. Looked on as simply the class clown because of his continuous pranks, he felt alone with no one to guide him. However through his antics, he still felt close to his fellow classmates because of it. But would always go home alone to an empty house. Through out his life, his education basically sucked for bad grades. But always seemed to become something of an enigma because of his strong desire to help others. Thus starts him on his path to become the next Hokage of the leaf. Now in the present, he is seventeen years old. And learning to delve deeper into his own soul to overtake and control the nine tailed fox within. With this new powerful weapon, he can have the advantage against a long time rival ex classmate named Sasuke Uchiha. A person who has gone beyond evil in his attempts to destroy the hidden leaf at any cost. Naruto with his friends defeated a section of a group called the Akatsuki. A group of powerful members who have been more than a handful for the leaf. Including one which completely levelled the leaf with one strike. As rebuilding of the leaf started, Naruto then discovers through help of some strange looking sage frogs, that he can attain full control over his Demon. But to do so, would mean to beat his other evil half. With his victory in hand, he now becomes a new transformed man, from a simple shin-obi to a sage, and soon to be Hokage in the near future. His powers grow even more now than ever since his battles within in soul. With his close friends, teachers, Tsunade, and past masters who helped him become a true shin-obi, Naruto is now on the verge of clashing with Sasuke once again. Whether or not he defeats his foe, he simply will not allow Sasuke to hurt those he loves. Especially Sakura. This is a great series, lots of fights, comedy, great music, laughs, sadness, and the ability to show what family is all about. Even though he grew up without parents, he still has more than his share of family within the hidden leaf. Recommended for all to watch, quite possibly the most successful series next to bleach and one piece, and now among the top three to be the longest running anime series to date.",2012

10,"naruto best anime ever Why I think Naruto is better than bleach . Better story line . Is not all about The main character . Cool villains yet smarter . Cool fighting scenes . Never runs out of ideas . Tells you the reasons of character has his powers . You relay to one of the character sooner or later . The main character doesn't waste time speaking while fighting nor is bi polar like Ichigo . Characters die unlike bleach . Is funny, cool, and sad all the good characteristics of a good anime . All the characters have a good history background, . Naruto has a reason to fight and become some one in the future, becoming hokage and saving a friend . To finalized this I hate bleach",2016

He overcomes all obstacles and makes new friends while defeating all the negativity with love. ",2015
5,"I'm a huge fan of the first Shrek and the second one also exceeded my expectations. Both of those movies had an meaningful and multidimensional plot. They also shared clever humor and for the most part unpredictable. I was extremely excited for the the third movie and I have to unfortunately say I was totally disappointed! The whole time I was waiting for it to start, like trying to convince myself, ""ok, any second now it will pick up"" - but it never did. The plot is so thin and unexciting - Prince Charming wants to takeover the throne while Shrek wants to get a young (King) Arthur to replace him as next in line to the throne. You never really feel any interest in what is happening or what will happen to the characters because you know exactly whats going to happen. Basically I spent the movie forcing myself to laugh because, hey, I was watching a Shrek movie. I know this review will not stop anyone who loved the previous movies from going to the third, but I just want to warn that its nothing to rush to or stand in line for.",2007
5,"I have been bouncing around for weeks in anticipation of this movie. As a huge fan of the first two movies, I was sure this one would not disappoint. But, oh, how wrong I was! While not as bad as many a film out there, this installment is yet a sad shadow of its series.",2007
6,"Shrek The Third is another entertaining romp through the erstwhile Hollywood of Far Far Away with a few laughs for adults and a few more for kids. Like all of the films in this series, it has a big and good heart, and occasionally pays homage to or pokes fun at modern films. Unlike the previous films, however, Shrek III is not a source of non-stop hilarity, and contains a little more thematic content.",2007

6,"The movie did not really hold the attention of my two younger kids. Even for me, the funny experience of watching both Shrek 1 and 2 was not really very evident with this installment.

7,"I couldn't wait to see Shrek the Third, especially since I have such a great love for the second Shrek, I'm just in love with Puss in Boots. But, the trailer looked great and the stories have worked so far, my mom and I saw the premier show today and while the movie has great laughs, there seemed to be something lacking in the Shrek world. I think the characters didn't seem to click as well as they did in the first two. Shrek the Third has the return of the whole cast, including the new heir to the thrown, Arthur.",2007
5,"The phenomenal success of the Shrek franchise - particularly ""Shrek 2"" - has prompted Dreamworks Animation to yet again squeeze out a story of an erstwhile happily ended tale and return to the screen once again with ""Shrek the Third"", which brings back most of the original cast, and then some, for another round of jabs at fairy tales and pop culture.",2007

1,"Of any sequel to any movie I have ever seen, Shrek the Third has to be the worst I have ever had the displeasure of sitting through. When a movie is this bad I usually will stop watching it, but I thought that maybe it would go somewhere. Well, it did. Reference the movie title, Flushed Away. This is what anyone who was connected to this farce should have insisted on happening. The storyline is plausible. The King is dying and must name an heir. At first Shrek is asked to become the new King, but the little experience Shrek has had with being royal has not worked out. The scene where he and Fiona are all decked out in royal attire is painful. Not just to the characters, even though they were just drawn, in wearing such uncomfortable clothing, but to the viewer who must endure this torture as well. So off our hero and his side-kicks must go and get the next in line, a wallflower-type geek, Arthur. Oh yea, before they are out of earshot Shrek learns that he will soon be a dad. I have read that some people say that it's because of Justin Timberlake that this movie was ruined, but like everyone else, all he supplied was a voice. A monotonous, squeaky one, but a voice just the same. In fact, it seemed from what I could tell just by listening to everyone's voices, that no one seemed to be really into their characters at all. Jokes and scenes that worked well for the 1st 2 movies did not work for the 3rd movie, and in fact, besides being stale, no longer had any appeal. That there is a 4th, and possibly a 5th Shrek, is scary. Be afraid. Be very afraid.",2008

1,"Shrek 3 trusts it's audience so little and has squandered so much good will in it's effort to milk cash from viewers, that it places it's characters on screen and nervously has them do stupid, ""funny"" things to reignite your interest and get the movie rolling. For fifteen minutes it barely considers plot, because maybe you don't like plot. So how about another pratfall?",2007
5,"Halfway through the third installment of the popular CGI franchise, ""Shrek,"" one gets the distinct feeling that the end is near. What prompts these emotions? Oh, just the fact that the writers seem to have run out of ideas, funny jokes and interesting new characters.",2007
4,"It would be safe to say that the third time is definitely NOT the charm when it comes to the ""Shrek"" series, since ""Shrek the Third"" lacks virtually all the imaginativeness, wit and magic that made the previous two installments such tremendous fun for young and old viewers alike. In this latest go-round, the writers have clearly run out of comical inspiration, leaving us with a humorless farrago of labored jokes and sappy life-lessons (mainly about the joys of prospective fatherhood and the importance of being willing to take a chance in life) guaranteed to please no target audience or age group whatsoever.",2007
3,Third installments are the hardest acts in the world. The second movie was commissioned on the popularity of the first. And if they green-light a third it must mean that the second was as equally or better than the first. So much expectation. So much to live up to.,2007

2,"I'm a Shrek fan, perhaps not the most enthusiastic in the world, but a fan nonetheless. I value the good laughs I got mainly from Shrek II, but I value them more because I could enjoy them with my entire family. That's rare for us. The Shrek series has plenty of magic to call upon: the entire panoply of mythic characters from Grimm through Disney, rendered in state-of-the-art realistic animation. It also has the resources of a star cast and the momentum of two previous successes. How then can it all add up to such a huge disappointment? It amazes me when Hollywood can take a success like 1 and 2, and make enough errors that coalesce into a cinematic mess. ",2007
5,"Paul McCartney is a great songwriter. Let me just get that out of the way. But he isn't perfect. Take for example the song, ""Live and Let Die"", a song he wrote in the '70s for a Bond movie of the same name. The song is used briefly in Dreamworks' latest outing for everyone's favorite Scots ogre. In the song he actually wrote this line: ""But if in this ever changing world in which we live in"". ""In which we live in""? Was he kidding? A great talent, but that is some lazy songwriting. I figure he was either exhausted, or under contract, as opposed to being inspired.",2007
3,"In all honesty Shrek is a kids movie, so they might love it, but the movie is a bomb for anyone over the age of fifteen. Personally the movie does not live up to the previous two. There was no conflict at all and the music was lame. Plus, the very few funny moments seem to surround the minor characters, Ginger bread man, Pinochio. Heck, even the shrek children were funnir than their parents. Even donkeys children were funnier and they did not speak. If you need to know anything else Shrek, the donkey, puss in boots are not funny in this movie. If you don't have a child, don't go to see this movie. It is not worth the ten dollars. Someone will eventually put the funny clips on you tube.",2007
9,"Humour is definitely the highest theatric art form, and Shrek is right up there at the top. Let's face it, it takes a lot more intelligence to write a good comedy than a drama or action film. In comedy, creativity and timing is critical. Shrek 3 has both! I own the first two Shrek DVD's and will definitely be adding this one to the collection. In general I do not like animated movies. Shrek is the only exception! As to the neigh-sayers, I would hardly know what to think. I mean, when B-Movies, like Sunshine for example, and horrors get a higher rating than this one, I guess there really is no accounting for taste. So if you like comedy and appreciate creativity and timing, go see Shrek. You will enjoy it. I would like to thank the creators for making this film.",2007
10,"OK, I know this movie hasn't gotten the BEST reviews but I personally think it is absolutely AMAZING!",2007
3,"Calling this third outing for the Shreck gang disappointing is giving it all the best of it. The characters lacked the freshness and pizazz of the first two. The voice characterizations were ho-hum. And who needs all those human-looking computer-generated figures? How about a little imagination here? Having Shreck become a father was a tired ploy used to juice up fading sitcoms. The cute baby ogres belong in early Disney. And what happened to Donkey and Puss-in-Boots? These two rollicking sidekicks are reduced to pratfalling bit players. Worse, for much of the movie their personalities are magically switched. This could have been funny for a quick bit, but it gets old fast. A clue to S-III's problems can be found in the lengthy list of writers, few, if any, of whom were involved in the first two.",2008

1,"Shrek the third is a nightmare. I've seen bad films (like Battlefield Earth, or even Necro Files 2) but this is ridiculous. This pathetic sequel is pure rubbish. The good old characters writhe in a nightmarishly stupid environment. With some nightmarishly stupid and mannered new characters. Boring, slow storytelling, with predictable ""twists"" well done enough for the taste of an average newborn. The worst thing is that this film is serious as hell. No clues of irony or sarcasm against the stupid fairytale (or worst the stupid pop-cultural) clichés. This film is sweet and cheesy like a big budget Barbie Fairytopia sequel without the charm, innocence, and low budget smartness of that.

3,"Eli Roth has learnt a lot of things from his mate Quentin Tarantino, but without a shadow of a doubt, how to talk was the one he learnt best. If you believed everything that came out of the Hostel: Part 2 director's mouth, you'd be under the impression that this was a new lesson in extreme cinema, pushing the boundaries of what is acceptable on screen to new and previously unheard of levels. Gore-hounds though will most likely walk out the multiplexes with the same aftertaste that the first Hostel left; it's violent sure, but it's not the harshest, most disturbing film ever made by a long shot. In fact, the only reason you should approach with kid gloves is because this time, it is girls that suffer. Young, nice and pretty girls with much to offer the world and whether or not dismembering them is more shocking than torturing and killing a horny male jock is a matter for feminist academics to debate.",2007

1,"I don't write reviews very often but i had to say something about this film - IT IS THE WORST FILM I HAVE EVER SEEN! The 1st Hostel was pathetic - to do a sequel that follows exactly the same plot as the original shows how poor a film-maker Eli Roth really is. The only difference between this and the first one is... wait for it... it has girls instead of boys as the lead characters! I suppose that was to up the horror factor, like seeing girls tortured is more horrifying than seeing boys tortured. Wrong, wrong, wrong. As with the first, the characters so stupid and clichéd you couldn't care less about them. There's the geeky girl who's dialogue is so poor you really just want her to die quickly, the annoying party girl and of course the 'heroine' who is not all she seems.",2007
7,"When Eli Roth came out with ""Hostel"", the movie was aptly described by a lot of critics as 'Torture-Porn'! 3 guys looking for sex and getting themselves into trouble in a far-away (and not that routine) place was very believable. Hostel 2 follows the same path, it's just that the guys pass on the baton to 3 girls this time. And of course, unlike the guys, these girls venture off to the unknown for pleasures (which probably includes sex for one of the 3 characters), but not just sex! But what makes Hostel 2 work is the the whole dynamics of the ""Elite Hunting"" organization that Eli Roth showcases. The torture scenes might be a dejavu of SAW 3 or the previous Hostel movie, but it's the concept of the ""Elite Hunting"" that makes one shudder. The vast reach of the gang, it's working style, the 'contracts' that are signed when bidding are finalised, they make a very disturbing (and should I add a chilling) viewing. Hostel 2 is no landmark cinema but it's a tad above the first installment. Watch it, for it might make you think about the concept of an ""Organisation""!",2007

I know there are not that many fans to the first film, I understand somewhat, it's not for the faint of heart and the first half is like a soft core porno, not to mention the blood and gore that's involved. But I think somewhere down the line it will be a classic cult film. Now for the sequel, I thought, despite a few flaws here and there, I thought it was just as good, maybe even BETTER than the first. Not the most shocking ending I've ever seen either, but it was a good one.",2007
1,"I just watched the film. About 1 hour and 40 minutes of utter garbage. I cannot express how awful it was, maybe some bits were gory, but the overall film in general is appalling. Simple tricks to get the characters out of situations, such as guns, which I despise in films. No twist and a boring story line. I think these films are best left to the producers and directors of the Saw films. De-humanization of beautiful woman must of been a main object in the director's mind, which was also overused. I did not enjoy the directing or acting. Such things as others have stated, as the shock tactics, were the main man behind the system has the gun to the children and ends up killing one child, which I believe did not work because you could envisage what the director/ writer had in mind. The end scene does not make any sense to the rest of the film, which seemed like a quick, simple way to end it, due to the lack of story. One last thing the gore is boring as well. However if you enjoy pointless, mind numbing, poor quality films I recommend this film to you. All in all a waste of time and money.",2007
3,"Apparently, Director Eli Roth has a fetish for ""snuff."" If fact, in a documentary I watched on the subject recently, Roth is interviewed and becomes visibly ""giddy"" when he comments on the realism of ""Cannibal Holocaust."" It is no small wonder that he developed the idea for, and directed the two Hostel films. I don't see that as an admirable quality, but then... I am old school and still believe the best horror isn't in-your-face-gore. I realize I am in the minority these days.",2007

Eeeccckk!..... ..But I have never turned off one of their movies. Last night I starting watching Hostel 2 ( out of boredom..Hostel 1 sucked too) and when it came to the scene where Heather M. was being hung upside down and then gutted so a naked woman could bath in her blood below...I immediately stopped watching and was totally disgusted! If this is where horror movies are headed courtesy of the Hostel and Saw films.. I have to say a big no thanks to horror movies! I had to think why this scene bothered me so much... I think it was because of the sadistic nature of it....it really was like a snuff film... it was too real... and too sick!..If you watched this movie and liked it.. you should should probably see a psychologist! and I am really not joking when I say that. "" Well aren't scenes of zombies ripping a human apart just as sick..?"" well yah they are..but there is not a sadistic-torture elements in the zombies scenes... in this movie it's human on human..WITH A woman getting sexual gratification from having another woman bleed on top of her! .. its sick!...and it's not entertainment... SAY NO TO SICK TORTURE AS ENTERTAINMENT!",2007
1,"OK, I was a fan of the first but now I'm starting to think I was a fan of my version of the first. All movies should have things that you think about when you leave the theatre. Hostel was one of them, by no means a perfect film but a very good effort. This however is so bad that it actually ruins the first. All the stuff you had in your head goes away, you see too much of the inner workings and it just doesn't make sense. The acting is awful with the exception of the lead girl (the one who lives). The character switch at the end makes absolutely no sense,The big guy knows they'll kill him if he doesn't finish her off and whats a bullet to the head when you've sawed her face off? The whole scene on the train is cringeworthy, the set ups look bad, the crowd of Italian soccer fans are all wearing fake jerseys for instance. And the end is crap, Don't get me wrong I squirmed in my seat when she had scissors wrapped around his nuts, decent horror moment and kind of funny. But one why the hell would you be calling her names - NO MAN WOULD!!! and two why did the evil group let her chop off the other girls head. The bubblegum kids don't work, it takes 40mins to actually see the torture place again. Jay Hernandez should have been in a more central role, although I did like his death scene. The bloodbath was good - the rest sucked - I've seen Last House on the Left and a woman bite off a wee willy, I don't really need to see it again. Although I think Eli Roth does again and again and again. The whole character switch thing is rubbish, one guy bottles it AFTER he puts a saw through a girls head and ther other goes a little mental when he looks at a picture of his wife, BS! I wanted to see them pick up all sorts of different weapons from the rack in the trailer like that bit in Kill Bill. I wanted more humour and more smarts. A man's penis getting chopped off and fed to a dog was funny, sick and made everyone squirm but as for a ""big payoff"" it was a waste of time. Eli Roth is in fact a crappy film maker who got lucky and kudos to the guy for jumping on QT train and riding it all the way, I would too. In terms of being the horror guy of this generation - Aja, Marshall, Wan and all the other splat pack dudes are waaaayy ahead - even those who've only had one film! Another point - The MPAA should seriously be ashamed of themselves, they're a joke. Whats the point of them if they don't say - ""No you can't show a man's penis being cut off and fed to a dog - just cut away"". This should be a NC-17, no way a Rated R. I'm not one for censoring films. Devils Rejects, SAW franchise etc all had good points in trying to push their films by the board but this is getting ridiculous, just scrap the MPAA. They don't do anything but get talked into stupid ideas.",2007

Hostel 2 not only a better ending than the typical horror (is it really over) ending of part 1 but it also has a more consistent story line, better acting, descent lead character development and interesting plot twist. I would highly recommend this film to any fans of the handful of truly good horror/thriller movies out there such as (Saw1 and the Ring). If you watched hostel 1 and thought it was an over rated farce of a movie like I did, then watch part 2, you wont be disappointed.",2007
8,"Hostel was a very flawed movie, made tolerable by the simple fact the main idea about people paying to torture and kill people was a very good one. It was disturbing, and the brief screen time that storyline occupied the movie made it worthwhile. Overall that film was 7/10 movie at best, it was gory, fun and had a great storyline. Yet its characters and the plot surrounding them was a mess. I didn't care less about a group of American college guys going to have lots of sex. Not only were they irritating as hell, but they also never seemed believable. By the time we saw them start dying in gruesome manners I was practically cheering the killers, it made there irritating mannerisms seem worthwhile as we saw them operated on, beheaded and having half a hand cut off with a chainsaw. I was looking forward to seeing Hostel Part 2 as I was intrigued where Eli Roth would take the story. Would he follow the survivor of the original, or follow a new group of people altogether. The answer is a bit of both, as Paxton does make an appearance, but the major storyline follows a group of girls off to Slovakia to go to a spa. And its with these three lead character Hostel Part 2 succeeds. These three are believable, and actually likable. We have the normal one, the party loving one and also the sweet and considered slightly irritating one. They seem like real people, so by the time the nasty events begin we feel for them. Hostel Part 2 is a rare thing in the horror genre, a sequel that surpasses the original. It might not be as gory in my opinion, but its more horrific, more scary and overall a lot better movie than the original ever was.",2007

1,"Sadly the voting scroll didn't provide a zero!! I would first like to start off by saying, ""Who in their right minds would give Eli Roth money to make this crap??"" I cringe just thinking about all the money that was wasted away from people stupid enough to purchase tickets to see this horrible movie. Luckily for me I didn't pay to see this, instead had a fellow pal pay for me....phew!! Anyways, sitting in this movie was very different from sitting in any other movie, in that the audience was more prone to laugh than to scream or even jump a little. I knew I was being an idiot when I decided to see this, but I never realized why I had been an idiot that day, until when the credits started rolling. I than realized that the biggest reason why I was such an idiot was because I watched that pathetic excuse of a movie!!!! I quickly sprinted out of the theater, hopped into my car and sped straight away to my house where many respectable horror titles remain. After talking with my friends I actually started to get jealous of the people back in the seventies and even the early eighties. Why may you ask?? Because of the fact that they had the opportunity to go to a theater and view flicks that were so much better than Eli's films. They got to go into a crowded theater and see Michael Myers attack Annie from her cars backseat and jump because it was so scary!! Those must have been the days!! Nowadays I am surrounded by picky, stupid young adults who don't want to see scary stuff...nah....they would much rather spend up to ten bucks to sit and watch naked pathetic girls get tortured and view old ugly ladies bathing in blood.....what the heck!! Eli must have some sick sick fantasies he had to conjure into his films..instead we should take the wacko throw him into an institution and leave filmmakers such as John Carpneter and even Rob Zombie to make more of their movies because at least their films are somewhat enjoyable to watch!!",2007
1,"This is a sequel to 2006's successful Hostel, and it fails miserably in every level: acting is horrible, story is pitiful, characters aren't developed fully and by the end it's just a gruesome collage of brutal deaths and mostly mediocre, bad actors (with the exception of the sweet, talented Heather Matarazzo).Don't waste your time buying a ticket to see this crap, instead rent the first one and enjoy. Basically, we have the same story of the first one, except with girls in the main parts, going to Slovakia just to be victims of Elite Hunting, a murder-for-profit company that sells to rich, bored people the opportunity to inflict suffering on others just for the pleasure of doing so. Point for point, this is what seems the problems with Hostel 2: 1. Bad, awful acting. The film's main character is played by Lauren German, who couldn't act to save her life. She can't transmit emotion, sadness, fear, no emotions. She just gives us the entire time that unnerving ""I am so better than you"" look that makes me want to join Elite Hunting just to take care of her character!Add to this the annoying Bijou Phillips who seems like a cardboard of these horror film's blond, dumb bimbos. Hell, people could simply cut the scenes of Sarah Michelle Gellar from I Know What You Did Last Summer and paste it on this crap. The same old stuff over and over again: hot, blond teenage who thinks only about sex and puts people down every chance she has. To top it all we have the two main bad guys who overact all the time and can't deliver a line without trying to chew the scenery. 2. Horrible characters. When the main character is a spoiled, rich and arrogant little brat, you don't give a damn if she survives it or not. The blond bimbo is annoying as hell and doesn't have nothing interesting to say for her whole screen time. She just goes through the motions, trying to be sexy as hell, and gets a chainsaw in her head by the ending. The two rich American guys were written as the typical American, rich Joes in every horror movie nowadays: you have the full of himself bastard and the best friend who seems like a nicer guy but reveals himself as an even bigger scumbag than his full of himself friend.Both bored with their lives, with the fact that they have a lot of family, health, a house, a great jobs, etc. The same old tired clichè. They are bored on screen and I off-screen! 3. Ridiculous script. How can you sum the story?Like this: three rich girls decide to take a trip to Rome. Enter the mysterious, European cold villainous snake who lures them to Slovakia instead after a fake attack on board a train, where the European snake gains the trust of the three Americans. The girls arrive in Slovakia, cue the obligatory party scene and they are caught one by one. Cue torture scenes, lots of blood, etc. The ""I am so better than you"" girl escapes, gets revenge on the European snake and by the end director Eli Roth, proving to us how a great guy he is, gives as a scene in which small kids play football with the European scumbag's head. In one line:the plot is boring as watch paint dry, stuffed with unnecessary brutality. 4. Bad directing: You would expect something from the guy who directed the first Hostel and was hailed as the next best thing. You won't find anything new here. Not a singe stroke of genius. Any other Joe could direct this crap and the result would be even better. The good points: Mind you, there are only THREE good points, by the end of Hostel 2. First, the one responsible for saving this from utter disaster is a girl named Heather Matarazzo. This brilliant talent who made a career for herself as Anne Hathaway's best friend in Princess Diaries is by far the best actress in the whole cast. She outshone every single actress or actor on the screen. Her character, a naive, sweet girl, is killed too soon, so the ""I am so better than you"" girl and the blond bimbo can get more screen time. Hostel 2 would be a better film had Heather be given the focus, but she wasn't, Lauren German was, and Lauren German won't find a great future ahead of her, not after this crap and not after we all saw what a horrendous actress she is. The scene in which Heather is hang naked and then beaten and cut to death by a cold, merciless European older woman, crying for help and pleading to be freed, made me fell so sorry for her character and for Heather herself, to play a scene that was surely so tough to face. She is a sweetheart, a cute, talented girl, I cheered for her character and felt that the movie was basically finished after Heather's gets caught in the hands of the European woman and is subsequently beaten and tortured to death. Secondly, good photography of some European villages saves something of the picture. Great scenery, wonderful use of location. Thirdly, there is only one moment in which you actually fell scared, and it's right on the beginning, in which we get to see Paxton (Jay Hernandez) recovering on a hospital. He receives the visit of a detective and her translator. The scene plays out perfectly: the detective giving the details from what his investigations led him, the charming but at the same time mysterious translator who seems to be analyzing Paxton's reaction and the ending of the scene, a real shocking moment that kicks off Hostel 2 so greatly but after Paxton's demise, it all goes downhill. I could see a better film had the detective and the translator be given more importance.",2007
4,"During the first ten or so minutes of Hostel 2, i was sitting there thinking 'wow this is gonna be a hell of a lot better than the first' The only surviving character from the first film, Paxton, returns, found on a train by the Russian feds. He is then interrogated in a Hospital by the Russian government, asking about what happened in the Hostel. He informs them about the bloodhound tattoo all the killers have, the man interrogating him replying 'you mean this tattoo' in a classic cliché horror way. And then he wakes up, and he's lying in bed next to his wife. It was a nightmare. Oh god i did not see that coming. Paxton and his wife argue, you then see her in bed alone and being woken by a noise outside. She goes to her balcony and see's the gardener trimming a tree with a chainsaw (if you didn't see what was going to happen next, then this film could prove a treat for you). She then wanders the house shouting for Paxton, and finally wanders into the kitchen where he is sitting. Oh yeah, and his head is gone. Those first 10 or so minutes were the best part of the film for me, and even they were cliché ridden, predictable and seen it all before. So if that's the best part of the film, what's the rest like? Well essentially, it's the first film all over again. But seriously, ALL OVER AGAIN. A group of travellers (this time three girls) meet somebody who tells them about this great place (this time not a sex Hostel, but a spa - see what they did there? Girls don't want Hostels, they want Spas) and they go there. One by one they're picked off in stupid (albeit, sometimes shocking) ways, until the final girl, who escapes (obviously). This film was pointless. If you've seen the first one, there is no point in seeing this (which is funny because people who go to see this will more than likely have seen the first). Sure, it has it's share of disgusting moments (although nowhere near as much as the first, and i thought even the first lacked in the disgusting factor it promised), and the appearances of not one, but TWO characters from Desperate Housewives did make me chuckle, and they played their parts well, but it doesn't stop it from being a bad film. If this was executed differently, it could have been rather brilliant, just like the first film. But it wasn't, and it isn't. It's yet another teen horror film that will be seeing bargain bins around the world in a few years. 4/10",2007
9,"Most horror sequels are entertaining but completely unnecessary. Hostel 2 justifies it's existence by elaborating on things fans were curious about and creating a very different tone while keeping the flavor of the original. Hostel bordered on ""Rated R teen comedy"" before switching gears to ""horror/thriller"". This sequel is largely a pitch black darkest of dark comedy. The movie certainly contains horror but it is in the form of individual scenes and there is even an overall sense of doom that hovers over the eventual victims that the first movie never had in it's first act. Even still, the movie is largely a dark comedy; very aware of it's own ability to create uncomfortable laughter. In my opinion, Hostel 2 is a fun movie that delivers the goods and never feels like a rehash. That's all anyone can ask of a sequel.",2007
7,"Not expecting a masterpiece, I can honest say I was very pleasantly surprised at just how much fun I had watching this movie. While it clearly tries way too hard to be hip, and the staggering amount of product placement serves only to distract, the story serves its purpose of allowing DJ Caruso to pull every trick out of the book, to very satisfying effect.",2007
8,"Disturbia is one of the best PG13 thrillers that I've seen in a long time. After all the other rated PG13 thrillers that have come out in the past six years or so, DJ Caruso, who directed, proves that it has always been possible to make a good suspenseful thriller these days without all the gore.",2007
8,"Disturbia star Shia LaBeouf appears to have a great future ahead of him. In the past few years, amidst forgettable roles in I, Robot, and Constantine, he contributed strong performances in films like A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints, and now in the thriller Disturbia. Although it is basically a remake of Hitchcock's Rear Window, Disturbia is unique in that it mixes elements of teen comedy, romance, drama, and gripping suspense in an entertaining way. Not to say the film is perfect, as it definitely isn't, but it accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do and then some. ",2007
8,"Disturbia tells the story of a teenage boy named Kale who is sentenced to three months house arrest after punching a teacher in the face for making a comment about his recently deceased father. When his mother takes away his TV and his computer, he resorts to spying on the houses surrounding him. Things begin to get frightening when he begins to suspect one of his neighbours is a serial killer. He gets his friends involved with his impromptu investigation, and soon the neighbour realizes he's being watched...And he's not too happy about it. Disturbia is loosely based off the 1954 Alfred Hitchcock classic Rear Window, but it is still a film all in itself, and it is the best thriller I've seen in a while.",2007
5,"The first half of this movie is really promising with its solid establishment of the characters and plot. yes, it's a rehash/ripoff of ""Rear Window"" but that's okay. And for those of you who haven't seen that classic, rent it immediately.",2007
7,"This movie was extremely well paced -- there was very good character development without excessive dialog. The story is exciting and thrilling: a modernized Rear Window. The acting was very solid, and every actor, major or minor, sold their part. Shia LeBeouf was a likable protagonist, Carrie-Anne Moss did a great job in her role as the mother, and David Morse played an exceedingly ominous and creepy neighbor. The climax is very suspenseful, although it did contain a few minor lapses in rational behavior by both the heroes and the villain, but I suppose that could be written off as desperation. Overall, it was refreshing to see a well-paced thriller with great suspense, humor, and character development.",2007
3,"Apparently... in Disturbialand, all adults are idiots. As a teenager, you can point out direct evidence of a murder and the adults will simply laugh at you. Your mother will insist on going over to the murderer's house and apologizing for you. The murderer will suddenly and stupidly (after years of calculated planning of all his murders) start attacking all of his neighbors.",2007
7,"The first time I saw this preview, the first thought that came into my head was ""Oh, my God, how could they rip off Rear Window?"", Rear Window is one of my all time favorite movies. But my boyfriend and I had nothing better to do last week and decided to see it, I have to say that actually, it wasn't as bad as I expected, I have to admit that it was a pretty good re-introduction to one of the greatest thrillers of all time. It had a new and fresh feeling with teens and it worked, despite how it seemed a bit more predictable than Rear Window, it still was pretty clever.",2007
7,"After the death of his father, Kale (LaBeouf) becomes angry and withdrawn. When he's failed in Spanish, he attacks his teacher, and is placed under house arrest for 3 months. Stripped of his mod cons (iTunes and xBox Live go out the window), he turns his attentions outside, and learns some disturbing truths about his suburban neighbourhood in a sinister take on the voyeuristic aspects of modern life.",2007
1,"What a waste of time. And the one star i gave was for the trailer. It was a very good trailer, full of suspense. And i thought that was worth seeing. And then...i realized this was a teen movie disguised as thriller. I don't know what David Morse is doing in such a movie. He really is scary. But that doesn't make his character believable. Why, if he has secret place where he kills and keeps his victims, would he keep one in the vents and kill without close his curtains? For example, there's more stupid stuff... And the girl, the new neighbor, what a hell does she see in such a loser like Kale? I really thought, as they showed the father being killed, that they were connecting Mr Turner to it, but no. So, the accident/murder was there only to fill time.",2007
1,"Are you serious? I wonder why this stupid movie has made even a penny. This movie would have been a thousand times better without the stupid teenage lust fest. It was not my turn to pick the movie, and I had no curiosity to see ""Rear Window Jr."" and boy I wish I listened to the inner voice! ",2007
1,"I hated this movie! I don't care what kind of star power you have ( if you can even call the kid from ""Even Stevens"" a star), how much money you have, or how well your movie is made, if the script is bad you have nothing. Disturbia is a stylish, highly-polished thriller. Everything looks good, it is well-directed, well-acted, and has an authentic, modern-suburban feel to it. However, once you get past the impressive first five minutes, the film falls completely flat! Without giving anything away, the movie has absolutely no surprises. In fact, Disturbia is so formulaic that anyone over the age of 10 should be able to predict exactly how the movie ends, including what happens to every single character. The dialogue is cheesy and ridiculous, every character besides the main kid (Kale) is completely one dimensional. By the time anything that is supposed to pass for scary happened I was so bored I didn't care who lived or died. This movie had absolutely no emotional resonance. I watched it alone, late at night, in the dark and was not scared once! I have worked in video retail for almost six years. Maybe I've just seen so many great movies that this one just seems especially bad. It is a mediocre film at best. There are good performances, but the actors really had nothing to work with. David Morse's suspected killer is a complete waste of his talent. I am happy I have a job where I can directly influence what people are renting (at least in one neighborhood of Seattle). I am going to make it my personal mission to keep Disturbia out of as many hands and homes as I possibly can!!!",2007
1,"I watched this flick because of the acclaimed critics. Well, it was a big mistake, because this film lacks everything that makes a film ""viewable"". Not good, but just viewable.",2007
4,This movie is OK if you want to spend a couple of hours trying to outguess the writer or the director.,2007
8,"I understand that the new movie Disturbia is about a person who is unable to leave his room and must look out the window for entertainment. During his peeping sessions, he finds that his neighbor might be a killer and by doing so, tries to get everyone around him to help find out the truth. That premise, and that premise alone, is the ONLY thing that likens this movie to Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece of tension and technical genius, Rear Window. Director D.J. Caruso has taken this script, no credit listed to the writers of that classic, and created a contemporary world around which he can create a cat and mouse chase from the small radius that our protagonist is allowed to travel within having a house arrest anklet affixed to his leg. If the critics are to be believed that this is a ripoff/remake, then every romantic comedy coming down the pipeline is one as well. Boy meets girl, boy must win girl, conflict causes relationship to stay strained, boy ultimately wins girl. Actually since every rom-com follows that exact plot sketch, they are more derivative than Disturbia to Rear Window because Caruso takes a premise, updates it, and makes it his own.",2007
7,I had seen the trailer of the movie and found it appealing. Later I found that it is somewhat similar to Rear Window  the Hitchcock movie and is on the same lines; that made me go and see this movie.,2007
1,"I hate to rate this movie as high as a 1 but I guess that's as low as it goes. I'll begin with what was good about the movie. The acting was fine, the premise was good and the production was fine. The writing in this film is simply lazy. For example, the police respond within a minute every time the main character goes past the boundary that his ankle bracelet allows, until it would be beneficial for them to arrive quickly. In this case the officer accepts the call (even though he is off duty), but then decides he'll respond when he's good and ready. Let's be realistic, he would either accept the call and respond with some haste, or he would let someone else get the call. Also, we have no idea why a minor would get house arrest for hitting a teacher who made a completely unprofessional and insensitive comment; this again, is lazy writing. There are also dozens of times when the main characters could have called the police on the neighbor (e.g. when he goes into the girls' car), but they don't because they are idiots. If they were really sure of the neighbor's guilt, they could have simply got the girl to call the cops and say that he touched her inappropriately. The ensuing investigation would reveal the dead bodies in his house, the connections to the past murders etc. But then again, this would make too much sense. When the writers should have gotten creative, they coped out and made the characters act as though they were mentally challenged. My final complaint is about the pacing; a bunch of useless slow story in the beginning, followed by pointless fast-paced action scenes. Even in these action scenes, lazy writing prevailed. When the main character is continuously grabbing for the transmitter on the counter, he has it in his hands several times but just ends up dropping it (as though it were covered in oil). This was the worst movie I have seen this year!",2007
1,I went to see this film last night off the back of a well written review on this site which gave it a great write up.. what I saw in the cinema was pure trash.,2007
8,Really good version of Rear Window where a kid on house arrest realizes that his neighbor is a serial killer.,2008
5,"When I first saw this movie I regretted spending my money on the ticket. The plot was so predictable, with villains next door getting away with just about every accusation a young boy could throw at him. Shallow characters taken straight from other movies. No new features I have seen in any character of this movie. It was a simple mix of many different other poor productions. And some time later it struck me!!! I have seen this story before! And where else could I see this not other than... The Simpsons. Season 6, Episode 1: Bart of Darkness. Look it up here on IMDb.COM. This episode of The Simpsons features Bart getting his leg broken leg in a cast, getting a telescope from his sister, starting watching people from Springfield using the gift. Sees no other than Ned Flanders - the next door neighbor doing suspicious things... murder is in the air... This episode was inspired by Rear Window by Alfred Hitchcock (1954) later remade by Pei Chan in Hou chuang (1955) and yet another time on TV under the very same title Rear Window (1998) (TV) starring Christopher Reeve. Are there no new ideas in the writers heads? Has everything been already written? Why can't I see Alfred Hitchcocks' name when I type Disturbia in IMDb?? When I first saw Disturbia I regretted spending money on the ticket. Now that I discovered it was a cheap ripoff I think it was just another moneymaker by people who do not care about the art of film making and, what is even worse, they don't care about the viewer... they only think about their pocket.",2008
1,Stupid love story destroyed this movie. This movie could have been a hundred times darker without the stupid teeny bopper lust fest. Give my money back and I'll stop complaining. And for god's sake where have all the good actors gone??? I mean this movie was done after the father/son crash. That was by far the most exciting part and I could have left the theater happy. Ankle bracelet for a teenager eh? Not exactly common practice but OK. I just hope they don't try to follow up this movie with some other stupid movie about that kid being more psychologically jacked up. Oh I know they are trying to come up with something just because so many of us wasted money on this pathetic piece of crap they call film.,2007
10,"I was very entertained when I saw an advanced screening of this last night, I was happy that this focused on the characters more, for they are very likable - It just makes the terror far more terrifying! It is of course similar to other thrillers, but what isn't? The young cast give very good performances in what is much like a smart teen romantic comedy, and the opening scene is very well done.",2007
6,We saw this at a special preview screening.,2007
2,"Watch Disturbia. If you need to get rid of 7.50 with no benefit to yourself short of donating to charity, go see this movie. I would rather swim with sharks with steaks tied to my legs. This piece of cinema dog crap is not even a scary movie. The killer really doesn't even come into play until the last 20 minutes of the movie where he just goes on a mêlée rampage with a baseball bat out of the blue, totally pointless.. It's cheesy, it's jokes are stupid, and the killer's house is apparently designed by James Bond. He has a secret room, and then inside that secret room is another secret room that leads into a basement, where beneath the floorboards is another secret room. C'mon, a secret room in a secret room in a secret room, that's stupid! I couldn't care less whether or not the kid died, and to be frank, had the neighbor gone on his rampage in the beginning of the movie, it still would've made the exact same sense, which is ""Hey, let's put a lot of teenagers in a house, and have a crazed psycho try to kill them!"" This is a very original idea, and I think this movie is very ""Oscar"" worthy. I would have rather watched a two hour documentary on the odor of dog crap. This movie sucked.",2007
2,"I don't mind that this takes heavy inspiration from Hitchcock's ""Rear Window."" I mind that it's nowhere near as good. This movie has severe story problems and a big tech problem, too, at least in the theater where I saw it.",2007
3,"As a comics reader who knows the source material, FF2 left me with a great deal of reservations. The ending in particular disappointed me. The new superhero movies always let us down when it comes to the cosmic part of the original stories.",2007
5,"In all its silliness and tongue-in-cheek disposition, the first ""Fantastic Four"" movie wasn't really a landmark as far as comic book films go. But it wasn't so bad either; it's just that after Marvel Comics' recent domination of the film genre, it's natural for one to expect that each of its characters having a shot at the big screen would present something legitimately entertaining to the audience. Something the first installment failed and the second struggled to achieve.",2007
1,"As difficult as it was, I decided to view 'Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer' as a film, not as a chance for redeeming a franchise. I thought this method might take away any fan boy predilections I had, in anticipation of this second installment to 'The Fantastic Four' universe. So, for a moment let's forget that the first film was without artistic merit. Let's forget that the story about a family of superheroes is arguably the most adored of all comic book properties.",2007
6,"I think it's safe to say that when it comes to special effects we have no more expectations, they all nail it these days. This movie was no exception, good graphics and pretty colors as another guy here said. Unfortunately, the moment the special effects kicked in the world of the movies, the good old script got a good kick in the nuts and can barely stand now let alone hold a whole movie on it's feet. This movie again, it's no exception. I have to admit, the plot was OK, the lines good, there was humor, romance, action, a reasonable balance to everything. Yet, I could not feel it taking me in; I remained a spectator, while the short dialogs even though containing the essence of the story, were still dry and well, short. No wonder the movie was a mere 92 minutes. Conclusion, a good PG movie, a bit better than the first one, but which still failed big time to impress, just like the rest of this summer blockbusters.",2007
5,"What is wrong here? You'd think the director and writer second time around would get better right? Yea, you'd think but no such luck. Tim Story directed this thing like a newbie while both writers could'not seem to shake corny near senseless dribble. If I was Exec Prod, I'd be one ticked off guy for spending more than 130 million on this. Hell, for 10 million and real talent they could have done so much better.",2007
6,"I don't know what it is about this movie that keeps me watching it every few months. It almost as if I need to watch it on occasion to remind myself how mediocre it is. It was hard to believe that a Marvel film utilizing one of the most interesting characters from the comic universe, Galactus, could be so bland. I suppose one of the reasons I keep returning to this film is that I want so badly to see the Fantastic Four franchise survive. I know it has potential; I love the characters, it has an interesting collection of villains to select from, and the comic series provides some great stories as starting material. It just isn't happening, thanks to poor writing and a little too much creative license at the hands of director Tim Story and writers Don Payne and Mark Frost.",2010
4,Wow. Where to begin. Let's start with the positives: The Surfer looked excellent. He really did. I was impressed and excited when he first appeared.,2007
8,"Tim Story stays true to the roots of the 2005 film, keeping this sequel fun and clean, while developing a new story with a couple new characters and making our favorite 4 heroes grow even more. Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer is better than its predecessor, and one of the better sequels of recent memory.",2007
5,"Like many other people, I was also thrilled upon watching the Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer trailer at the cinema. Similar to numerous people who adore CGI, read the comic books when they were kids and thought the first installment was decent enough to justify a sequel, I was more than willing to get myself ready to be overwhelmed by the mere strength of the eye candy and CGI effects within the film. And then I watched it at a special press screening in Ramat Gan, Israel. ",2007
9,"Yes, if you liked 1 you'll like 2 and if you didn't, you won't (and you won't like it if you expect to see the source material faithfully reproduced without tweakage). And I didn't see any Galactus helmet silhouette anywhere apart from a couple of points where I kind of almost persuaded myself a bit that I might have seen something which kind of reminded me a bit of what it might look like if it had been there except maybe I was just imagining it.",2007
7,"The Fantastic Four are back in action, trying to save the world once more, this time from mysterious alien 'The Silver Surfer' whose creating havoc by inflicting blackouts and huge craters throughout the World,",2010
10,"When the first film was over, I was disappointed because I wanted MORE!, feeling cheated that this cool quartet of super heroes had done their job, and the credits rolled... kind like ""The Sopranos"", without the hype. Here is the sequel, and this film rocks! Mr. Fantastic and the troupe are back, with their powers, their very distinct personalities, and plenty of charm, ready to save the world, showing how a team works, like a true family.",2007
7,"I must say I was pleasantly surprised that the sequel out shined the first one. First one was...all right but it was slow paced and every character needed to get developed. Some say it was down right horrible but I don't think so. The second installment once again lacked in the story/plot department. It was definitely very comic book like but even comic book motive can be identifiable outside the movie realm. The dialog was par but had some cheesy moments as well. I think the F4 can never really be compared to X-Men or Spider Man. With no disrespect the F4 are no match for them at all. It's like they are their own genre/film and they are going to have a pattern with each film. Back to the movie, dialog, all right, special effects amazing. Character development was much better, the viewer gets to see some change within each character. I am a tad disappointed that Galactus was just an enormous cloud planet eating spectrum. Oh well, it was an effort. Over all this movie is just flat out fun and entertaining. Don't have high expectations like Spider Man 3, then you will just think the movie sucks in general. Although I have to say this film surpasses spider man 3...shockingly enough. If you go to this movie, have no expectations and just sit back and enjoy the flick.",2007
10,"""The Fantastic Four: The Rise of the Silver Surfer"" (**** out of ****) qualifies as fabulous, often funny, family-friendly fare. Not only does the second installment in the far-fetched, formula-driven, Marvel Comics fantasy franchise provide a refresher course for those who've forgotten the first film, but this Twentieth Century Fox release also introduces a new character. This time around Mr. Fantastic/Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd), Sue Storm (Jessica Alba), Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) and Ben Grimm (Michael Childis) tangle with a villain that dwarfs even the maniacally evil Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon) and find themselves struggling to save the Earth from an apocalypse like nothing that they faced in the original. The computer-generated special effects are first-rate, unlike those in ""Spider-Man 3,"" but the CGI as well as the apocalyptic plot never overshadow the characters and the tensions that their comic camaraderie conjures up. Invisible Girl Sue Storm still scolds rubbery Mr. Fantastic Reed Richards about his nerdy obsession for all things scientific, while incendiary Johnny Storm cannot rib the granite-hard Ben Grimm enough about his stony countenance. Director Tim Story, who helmed the breezy lightweight original, knows one thing that other summer movie directors could learn. Namely, too much of a good thing is not always a good thing. Clocking in at a short and snappy 89 minutes, the new ""Fantastic Four"" adventure allows you barely enough time to drain a barrel-sized soft drink before you have to drain something else.",2007
10,Back in 2005 when I saw the original Fantastic Four I thought it was going to be amazing instead I sat through two hours of boring film. When I saw the trailer for Fantastic Four 2 I said to myself here we go again and it isn't worth spending the money.,2007
9,"I've written almost two years ago that I adored the movie adaptation of Fantastic Four, despite many out there who hated it to the core. Back then, what I found was right about it was its spot on characterization and its capture of the spirit which was FF, the bickering amongst its members as well as its theme on unity and family. I'm surprised that I actually predicted the coming of Galactus, though some would be disappointed with his big screen appearance.",2007
8,"I enjoyed it, mostly. First of all, it was ten times better than the groan-awful disappointment of FF1. I know this isn't setting a very high bench-mark, but credit where it's due: they aimed to improve and they did. The story was cleaner, leaner, better directed, easier to follow and easy to enjoy. All the four leads were better and more comfortable in their roles, although personally I still think Jessica Alba was a seriously bad choice. Minor improvements all round in terms of art direction, set design, make-up (The Thing is slightly better this time around) and costume. As for the SFX... brilliant in places, acceptable-to-good most of the time, just a few puzzling rough edges (they still haven't quite got how to portray Reed stretching, and it still looks painfully obvious where the actor ends and the CGI takes over).",2007
8,"I'm sure the critics and naysayers of this film will take exception to my review, but I loved this! As a longtime fan of the Fantastic Four comic, I went into the first movie with fairly low expectations, and was very pleasantly surprised to the contrary. Not a great superhero movie, but a really fun one, a trait that far too many films based on comic books seem to be lacking. Having enjoyed the FF the first time around, I went into this second one with much higher expectations - and it exceeded them on almost every level! The same feeling of fun was there, along with some real blow-you-out-of-your-seat action sequences, and what I thought was a pretty good storyline. Perhaps I'm too undemanding or simple-minded, but I had a Fantastic(!) time in the theater watching this movie. In many ways, it blew me away like no movie has in a good many years, and made me feel like a kid again! Of course it helped that along with the FF, the Silver Surfer has always been one of my favorite comic characters. If I have one complaint, it's that it ended too soon. I hated for it to be over after only 92 minutes. Hopefully when the DVD is released they'll include a longer extended version as well (or as in the case with the first movie, they'll wait two years until the third one comes out, and make us buy the second movie on DVD all over again). I really hate that sort of marketing ploy, but in the case of FF2, it will gladly shell out my money twice. Mostly because I can't wait for the DVD to come out. I think I'll start working on my new home theater system tomorrow!",2007
10,"I was not a great fan of the first Fantastic Four movie. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed it for the pure fact that I could escape from reality for a couple of hours but it didn't quite grab me like the first X Men or the first Spiderman movies - mainly due to too much character building. That did not put me off seeing FF2: ROTSS though as I knew that it would be SO much better than the first one - and boy was I right! Not only did this move have great special effects, some excellent humour and some real ""WOW"" moments (all I will say is that the new spaceship is pretty awesome) but it also had one of the most curious and interesting characters in a comic book movie which came in the form of The Silver Surfer. Doug Jones did a great job and Larry Fishburne as the voice of The Silver Surfer is nowhere near as bad as some people make out. Along with The Silver Surfer came Galactus who is perhaps the most imposing and threatening bad guy ever created in a comic book movie.",2007
4,"After the critics and comic-book aficionados gave the first Fantastic Four film a ""bitchslap"" of bad reviews, it became a surprise hit nonetheless. But some of you already knew there was going to be a sequel on the way. And since there were a lot of mistakes made, there must've been some lessons learnt from everyone involvednot that they could care less about ""negative reception"", since the movie has made 330 million worldwide. 2 years later, the promise that the sequel will be darker (so they say), and more serious (so they say), have been hype to death, though this is the same hype that has damaged both Spider-Man 3 and X3. Then, there's the publicity stills of the Silver Surfer as the next FF baddie, helping me leave my lowered expectations behind. I decided to give this one another shot, and that's because the Silver Surferwho is one of the coolest Marvel creations ever. ",2007
1,I haven't laughed my way through an entire film in many years. This movie was so wildly bad it made my brain hurt.,2007
3,"Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer continues Marvel's losing streak of crappy movies (Daredevil, Electra, Ghost Rider, anyone?). This latest monstrosity seems to indicate that Marvel lucked out in landing Sam Raimi and Bryan Singer to helm their Spider-man and X-Men franchises but otherwise are as clueless as any of the suits in Hollywood as to how to adapt their characters to the big screen.",2007
10,"I just saw the premier of this and I have to say, it is one of the best Marvel movies ever. The special effects are even better than X3 and Ghost rider, and the Silver Surfer is beautiful to watch.",2007
2,"I am a comic book reader of longstanding, and have enjoyed several of the screen adaptations of comic books, but both Fantastic Four films have been textbook examples of how NOT to translate a comic book to the screen. Seriously, I thought they couldn't make a worse film that the original Fantastic Four, but I have been proved wrong.",2008

10,"Andrew Dominik's The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, is a deliberately paced, stunningly visualized, and emotionally charged exploration of the early development of mass media celebrity in America. The film riveted my attention for two hours and 40 minutes, and has remained on my mind for several days after my viewing. Although centered on one of the iconic legends of the Old West, it is far beyond an updated reincarnation of the Western. It is an epic allegory about the development of the American cult of celebrity and the effects of this obsession on the individuals caught in its web.",2007
10,"If you have watched the trailer and know this movie is two hours and forty minutes long you know what you are getting into and should not be disappointed. This movie delivers on every level of film making, be it cinematography, acting, or writing. Casey Affleck delivers a fantastic performance in how he portrays Robert Ford as the bright eyed fawning kid in a way so sincere it makes the audience uncomfortable even when it shouldn't. Brad Pitt underplays his part as Jesse James hitting all the right notes while never saying much. Exactly the way one would expect an outlaw to act when they have everything in the world to hide. I can't say the movie didn't FEEL two hours and forty minutes long but I never wanted it to end sooner than it did. I guess I just enjoyed the time I got to spend watching these characters for the full running time.",2007
9,"Though Jesse James through the newspaper accounts of his exploits and through the dime novels of the day was already a legend, his immortality was sealed on April 3, 1882 by the manner of his death. The lengthy title of the film tells all or at least the official version of the story.",2007
9,From writer/director Andrew Dominik comes the long titled and lengthy timed The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford starring Academy Award nominee Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck. The film in so much of its glory has both positive and negative components that make this an uneasy experience at the movies.,2007
10,"I've been thinking of a good way to start my review, I've been pondering many opening sentences, but none of them are close enough to the point, so I've decided to just say that this film is perfect in all aspects. When the credits started to roll I didn't move at all, I sat staring at the screen just thinking about what I just watched. I was trying to understand if what I just saw was really that good, or if I was just thinking it was. The film runs at almost three hours, but never looses your attention for one second. It moves forward through dialog that is poetic, but increasingly haunting at times.",2007
10,"This almost defines the oft-used term ""elegiac Western"". It has some of the well-worn themes of Westerns, such as the creation of Western myth vs. the cold, harsh realities. But for some reason, it never feels like anything else I've ever seen. It has a style more reminiscent of Michelangelo Antonioni than any of the great Western filmmakers. It's slow and likes to surround its characters with enormous landscapes that almost swallow them whole. But it's also not averse to close-ups. Director Dominik, who has only made one other film, Chopper, and it's been seven years since then, loves to concentrate on facial expressions, as well as body language (don't know if I've ever seen a film with this level of attention to body language, or maybe it's just not something to which I've ever been lead to pay much attention). The cast is uniformly brilliant. Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck are the titular leads, and neither has done as well. Affleck is a revelation. The supporting cast includes Sam Rockwell, Mary-Louise Parker, Jeremy Renner, Garrett Dillahunt and Paul Schneider. Andrew Dominik is the star, though. There have been plenty of successful Westerns over the past couple of decades, but I'd be hard-pressed to name a single one out that so beautifully and completely re-invents the genre. 3:10 to Yuma may well be the big money-making Western of the year, but I think history will recall it as being the year that The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford was released. It is the best film of the year so far, and will be hard to top.",2007
9,Casey Affleck's has officially come into his own. Fantastic performance! ,2007
10,"This movie was quite simply AMAZING! Oscar worthy performances from Affleck, Pitt, and Rockwell-Oscar worthy cinematography-Oscar worthy directing. Hate me if you want, but the pacing was perfect. I was glued to my seat. The best part about this movie is that it could have easily been a set up for failure given how slow the story is, but the tension created by each actors performance left me wanting more. The last thing the world ""needs"" is another typical, gun slinging western. This is by far the best movie I've seen all year.",2007
7,"This is a sprawling and glamorous Western but overlong. Packs colorful scenarios, slow-moving pace and slick edition. Wonderful cinematography by Roger Deakins and atmospheric musical score by Nick Cave. The motion picture is well realized by Andrew Dominik who displays enough off-beat touches to keep things interesting.",2009
1,"I have to admit, looking at some of the other comments here I'm not sure if I and other reviewers saw the same movie. I want the mind-dulling 2:40 of my life back.",2007
9,"Despite some pointless narration (and irrelevantly blurred editing during the scenes with this narration) and the complete mistreatment of one of the finest actresses of the decade, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is easily one of the finest modern films around and certainly one of the best of the year. It plays as a Shakespearean tragedy instead of an outlandish, action-filled western that one would expect when hearing the name Jesse James. Featuring some of the best performances of the decade, the film is a wonderful mix of subtle and emotional heartache with biting realistic tension and a beautifully flawed character that everyone can relate to in some way. Slowly the film builds a tension and knowing dissension towards the inevitable downfall of Mr. James. It's a heartbreaking story of one man trying to be remembered and another knowing a betrayal is quickly coming upon him.",2007
7,"""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" is a handsomely mounted, film-school like study of the last days of the infamous James' Gang by director Andrew Dominik. Growing up in awe of Jesse James (Brad Pitt), Robert Ford (Casey Affleck) finally gets to live out his dream of living side by side with his idol when his brother, Charles (Sam Rockwell) joins the gang. Young Robert quickly learns that the exploits of the murderous train-robbers are far from the exciting flights of fancy he grew up reading about in newspapers and dime-store novels. A series of cowardly acts in the wake of double-crossings and humiliations ultimately lead to the titular event.",2007
8,"Until last night I had struggled to find the right opportunity to watch this movie. Sometimes I find a movie that I know I will have to be prepared for, to be completely attentive in order to fully appreciate it. This was one of those movies for me. I had been put off by the fact that it was going to be quite a long film which, essentially, I knew the outcome of before even watching. If you don't know the history behind the real life character of Jesse James before then the title is a real giveaway as to what to expect in terms of its ending - but this is in no way a bad thing. I began to watch this in bed while feeling quite sleepy. I half expected to switch it off halfway through and watch the rest another time. Impossible. Historically, the accounts of Jesse James's murder allowed Jesse an immortality through legend. Robert Ford was portrayed as the coward who shot an unarmed man in the back. This movie does not take sides however which allows the viewer a much more open experience. However, it does allow the Ford brothers a fairer representation than they have had before. Essentially the movie portrays James and Ford as the characters they were - flawed human beings whose lives were shaped by how they reacted to circumstances around them. Pitt gives an incredible performance as Jesse the man, not the legend. He steals and he murders. He does what he deems is necessary. As Ford, Affleck is unforgettable. Watching him twist through a range of emotions as he journeys with his hero is intriguing. He is fragile, yet vicious; torn between feelings of adulation and disgust towards Jesse the man, not the legend he envisaged. The cinematography and musical score capture the mood of the movie perfectly. Silence is often preferred to the masculine speeches and action expected of western movies. This gives us time to assess what life would have been like back then. Far more ruralised, lonely and silent. But also a ruthless world where your own survival could come at the cost of killing another man. We get to witness cold acts of murder as they are - necessary to the person committing them. This movie is highly engaging from start to finish. The intriguing relationship between James and Ford is a seriously fresh take on actual events. The two and half hours flew by for me which is often the sign of a great movie. The only thing that annoyed me while watching was in the bar scene when Ford has been mocked in a song and announces to a silenced bar who he is. After this he falls on the floor drunk then leaves silently. I think there was serious potential here for a legendary speech to be made by Affleck. It would have given more weight to the argument that Ford's role in the saga has been unfairly misrepresented over time. Perhaps this wasn't done so that the movie could remain neutral to interpretation where a rousing speech may have caused the viewer to sympathise with Ford. Overall I have given the movie 9 out of 10 because it is an unforgettable story and arguably the best western this century. The actual assassination scene remains wide open to interpretation. Do I think James wanted to die? No. But in the moment he dropped his guns I think that he embraced and accepted death.",2010
6,"It's hard to imagine this film being much of a success, despite starring Brad Pitt. It's a long-haul: slow-moving, intensely melancholic and sombre, dealing in grey-paletted landscapes and skyscapes, pauses, silences, things unsaid as much as things said. Still, it's been critically successful, and it address questions pertinent to today's society. Fame. Hero worship. The desire to be someone else, as an escape from the drudgery of your own life (""do you want to be like me, or do you want to be me?""). The realisation that that someone else is ""just a man,"" just like you, and that he perhaps struggles with the same sense of drudgery and hopelessness, as you do. ",2008
1,"1. The film has a good, quite authentic look to it - at least as far as props, costumes, sets, etc. The sound of the old, wood-frame houses was right on. The landscapes are obviously not where they are supposed to be, but that follows an old tradition in Westerns. Canadian locations have become very identifiable & are obviously not Missouri nor any adjoining states.",2010
10,"This was a very good movie and I would definitely recommend it but it is 2 hours and 40 minutes with it being slow at times. Still it has some great acting, musical score, cinematography with good directing.",2008
9,"Every now and then, in the realms of western / period dramas a very special film comes along. This is such a film. It's haunting, compelling, thought provoking, (dare I say) conversation inducing - a visual tour-De-force with stunning landscapes, emotive lighting and classic film-making techniques all rolled into one. It's been a long time since a film enveloped me in the way Andrew Dominic managed to take me right inside the carriage of the train the characters were robbing on screen. But that's just a small part of the visceral, assured strength of a film that takes its time unfolding and trusts in the performances of a well rounded, tight, cast. Yes, it was Brad Pitt who won the award at Venice, and he's competent within the range of his ability - by which I mean I've seen him give performances like this before, and he is improving with age ... but the truly subtle, charismatic and deft performance comes from Casey Affleck - his is an Oscar-worthy performance and key to the emotional success of the film. All other supporting actors are seasoned character actors.",2007
9,"In what could be my favorite film name of all-time, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is much more than its superfluous moniker. From its bloated runtime to its slow, methodical pace, Andrew Dominik's epic tale contains an inner beauty that allows for all the pretensions one seems to associate with it. Dominik is unrelenting on his quest to tell the story the way he wants it told, never compromising by cutting scenes or shortening the name so it will fit on theatre marquees. The film even seems to have been languishing in the doldrums for over a year before finally seeing the light of day. Maybe the time was spent because no one would distribute it without changes, and if that is so, I'm glad to have waited for its introduction. Had anything been compromised, I don't think I would have enjoyed my time nearly as much. Do not expect the wild west or gun fights at every corner. This is not a tale of excess or young guns, but instead one of paranoia, suspicion, friendship, and betrayal from all sides.",2007

When the police arrive, he confesses and hands in his weapon, and the case is passed on to hotshot DDA Willy Beachum (Gosling), who sees this, his final public service trial before he moves onwards and upwards, to be a slam-dunk case; but alas, thanks to Crawford's mind games, things are not what they seem and the case undergoes a series of twists and turns as Crawford and Beachum engage in a tense battle of wits.",2007

10,"I thought the intellectual chess game between Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling was pure joy. What a pleasure to watch the two play mind games with each other -- with the audience in on the action. Thought the pace was good, the direction suspenseful. The only aspect of the movie that I would say was less than A+ was the love interest between Ryan Gosling and Rosamund Pike. I thought it a bit confusing that she was both his boss and his love interest. Not sure they needed the full love interest in the plot. All in all, a most entertaining movie. Other than that, the plot line of the legal case was engaging, understandable and realistic. I highly recommend it to those interested in movies that make you think.",2007
7,"I was quite surprised at how much I enjoyed watching this film as I heard many positive critical reviews before going into it so I had high expectations to begin with. However I was not let down one bit since ""Fracture"" more than held its own. It contained a very simple plot structure but also offered a very original take on a different type of court case. While it might not be possible in real life, it worked magic on the big screen and transformed into an excellent film almost within the first few minutes.",2007
6,"The first 3/4 or so of Fracture are amazing. The acting is dead-on, the writing is solid, and the plot is done just well enough that it's incredibly entertaining without being either trite or pretentious. The story is simple enough: Ted Crawford (Hopkins) -- ostensibly an aerospace engineer who runs a successful company -- catches his wife having an affair and shoots (but doesn't kill) her. Being incredibly meticulous, he is able to plan every detail of the attempted murder to assure himself of an acquittal. Willy Beachum, Assistant DA handling the case (Gosling) is a hotshot who's on his way out the door to bigger and better things and, at first, neglects to prepare well for the case. The middle half of the movie is essentially the legal struggle between Beachum and Crawford. Ultimately, the overconfident Beachum is no match for the cunning Crawford. Toward the end of the trial, there is a scene in which Beachum must decide whether or not to plant evidence in order to obtain a conviction. The tension is palpable and the scene comes off as one of the best and most dramatic in the movie. In the end, Crawford is acquitted and, as he leaves the courtroom, his wife's grief-stricken lover shoots himself. This would have been an almost perfect ending to the movie, and would have guaranteed it at least an 8 or 9 rating from me. Up to this point, it was a solid film that was realistic, and just unconventional enough to stand out.",2007

3,Mildly entertaining but only for Hopkins on screens. Rest of movie was dreck. Subplot with the corporate law firm was a complete waste of time.,2007
8,The character played by Anthony Hopkins tells a story in the film to Ryan Gosling. The story is about sorting eggs on a farm when he was a boy and about putting aside 300 eggs that all had minute cracks or imperfections. The moral is that everything has a weakness if you look closely enough. Hopkins is using the story to warn Gosling that his near perfect conviction record is about to be tested like never before.,2007

9,"If you love a really good film, then I implore you to watch the superb 'Fracture'. Starring the fantastic Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling, 'Fracture' is a brilliant crime thriller. The opening to this movie is so well constructed as we follow Ted Crawford (Hopkins) secretly watching a couple as they frolic in the sun and the pool at a hotel. When he returns to his home we discover that the woman he was watching is his wife and he raises a gun and shoots her. When the police arrive, one of the detectives on the case is, yup you guessed it, the man she was having the affair with. All the facts are shown to us, we watch as Crawford shoots his wife, we watch as he readily confesses, we see the lead detective retrieve the gun from him and all seems straight forward, it would appear that Crawford's fate seems obvious right? Well, to Willy Beachum (Gosling), the young deputy DA who is assigned to prosecute him, this also appears to be an open and shut case, however following some clever twists and surprises in court, and the apparent lack of evidence, a battle of wits ensues resulting in Willy's obsession to see him proved guilty. This is a very clever and compelling thriller, and there are some very witty moments. The performances from the two lead actors are seriously impressive. Ryan Gosling plays this role so well, his character is a cocky hot shot lawyer and you really get that his focus, at first, is not really on this case. It seems so open and shut and it's his last case with the firm he is with before he moves on to a bigger and much more prestigious company, and that is his focus, but as the case progresses we see his determination, focus, and ultimately his ethics, take a turn. Hopkins is, as always, magnificent and the way he portrays Crawford with such a cool, calm and actually quite witty confidence is actually quite creepy, and you find yourself really rooting for Willy to get this guy put away. There are some great stand-out scenes and the reveal to the court of the detective's affair is so well done and the way that Gosling reacts you could almost think that he, the actor, didn't even see it coming. Superb The director is Gregory Hoblit, who was also the director on another brilliant courtroom drama, 'Primal Fear', with Richard Gere. He really knows how to take you along and draw you into to the story. Please get to see this film.",2015

I enjoyed Fracture not least because I thought is was extraordinarily clever and lets face is, anything with Anthony Hopkins in is worth watching. I never saw the twist coming at the end and all the way through the film I was never sure whether the good guy or the bad guy was going to triumph. It is an inferior film to a lot of Hitchcock film because the thing about Hitchcock is that not only does he make clever films but he charms you along the way. Fracture does that but only to a point. It has none of the stylish filming that Hitchcock had and yet I can't help thinking that Fracture is perfect for the modern day. It pleased me as a film-fan and as an ordinary guy just relaxing and watching a film. It was clever, well written, well acted and just really thrilling to watch.",2010

8,"I have never been one to shy away from saying that most action films just plain do nothing for me. Most times they are blatant vehicles to blow stuff up, show off sexy models, and throw any semblance of reality or intelligence out the window. With that said, the Bourne series has been fantastic. Doug Liman ushered in a new take on action by using a more cinema verite style, showing the fights in full force and making our super spy someone we can relate to emotionally as well as humanly. This is not the sci-fi absurdity that was Bond (before they did an overhaul in the style of this series no less). There was a lot to worry for when the Bourne Supremacy came out. With director Paul Greengrass taking over, what could have been a second-hand copy of the original ended up being an improvement in style and flair. The stakes were raised and the story was enhanced because of it. Greengrass needs to be given a ton of credit for being able to keep up appearances with the latest installment, The Bourne Ultimatum. In what is an amazing conclusion to a top-notch trilogy, the action is brought to a new level and story and performance are never compromised.",2007
10,"I don't hand out ten star ratings easily. A movie really has to impress me, and The Bourne Ultimatum has gone far beyond that. Furthermore, this trilogy has come together so nicely, that I believe it to be one of the greatest motion picture trilogies of our time. Though all three films could not be any more different from the Ludlum novels, they still stand as a powerful landmark in cinematic achievement. The Bourne Ultimatum made me want to cry that the series was complete, yet I could not even attempt to stop smiling for hours.",2007

I also liked the filming style where the shakiness and different angles just made it feel like you are a part of the scene.

10,"When the Bourne Identity arrived five years ago I have to confess that I didn't think much of it. At the time I was eleven years old, so perhaps I was too young to really get into the storyline and understand the whole scenario. Two years ago when the Bourne Supremacy arrived I thought it was a better movie than Identity but still didn't think it was as good as I expected it to be judging by the trailers. Over the past two years I had been told numerous times that the Bourne movies were amazing, many a time I had to bite my tongue and not say what I really thought about the movies. Until two months ago I couldn't have given a damn about the Bourne Ultimatum, I really had no intentions of watching it. But then I decided to go back and re-watch the first two before I came to any abrupt decisions. So I went out and bought both the original movies. And what a surprise it was to me when I was gripped by them. Identity I found the superior of the two, but Supremacy isn't far behind. They're both slick, action packed and thrilling pieces of cinema that I have watched numerous times since I bought them. Because of this I was first in line today to see the Bourne Ultimatum. And boy did Bourne Ultimatum not disappoint! ",2007
8,"Paul Greengrass definitely saved the best Bourne for last! I've heard a lot of people complain about they way he filmed this movie, and some have even compared the camera style to the Blair Witch Project. All I have to say to that is...are you kidding me? Come on it was not that bad at all. I think it helps the action scenes to feel more realistic, which I would prefer over highly stylized stunt choreography. As for the rest of the movie I really didn't even notice it.",2007

Sample data we Sylvester Stallone - Rocky, Daniel Radcliffe - Harry Potter and Harrison Ford - Indiana Jones like. So there is a character that define them are good players. Matt Damon certainly played a lot of character in a wonderful way. But I think Matt Damon's Jason Bourne come to mind is mentioned. Although the movie you feel sad inside that action on it. Matt Damon's Bourne character and it gives you in a great way. Bourne character to the injustice and shows the loneliness of the characters is very nice. Cool the quality of each other every film, but this film deserves to be told that the end was the best of them slipped.",2015
8,"I will begin by saying I am very pleased with this climax of the Bourne trilogy. Please, oh please don't ruin it by doing a sequel years from now or a prequel. Just leave it alone. Right..moving on.As talented and versatile as Matt Damon is...it seems as though he was just meant to play Jason Bourne.",2007
9,"The Bourne Ultimatum - Jason Bourne (Matt Damon in his best role ever), the newest spy kid on the block, brings his quest for his identity to a close as he also seeks to end the CIA's latest program ""Blackbriar"" to make super assassins like himself.",2007
10,The final installment in the action thriller franchise is just that probably the hardest hitting of the three films. It goes further to play the anti-Bond theme. Bourne doesn't like what he is doing and wants to know about his blurry past. Everything about this film hits it on the nail from the cinematography to choreography/stunt work to the script to acting.,2007
9,"Im going to keep this fairly brief as to not spoil anything for you. This movie is awesome. From beginning to end, it is filled with genuine thrills. The fight scenes are fantastic, the chase scenes are enthralling, and it moves at such a pace that it really only felt slow toward the end when things are explained, but that is only because everything that preceded it. Damon shines and really has proved a very solid actor, daring you not to believe him in this role. He is this role. A welcome addition to the series in David Straithrain (hope i spelled that close to right) as a seedy CIA agent out to kill Bourne. This is non stop and will truly leave you on the edge of your seat for most of the way. Some things toward the end are just a smidgeon preposterous, thus negating a 10 rating. The ending is left open for sequels and I sure hope that they consider doing more of these, for none have been bad. Excellent film all in all and a fantastic ending to an amazing trilogy.",2007
1,"How sheep-like the movie going public so often proves to be. As soon as a few critics say something new is good (ie - ""Shake-Cam""), everyone jumps on the bandwagon, as if they are devoid of independent thought. This was not a good movie, it was a dreadful movie. 1) Plot? - What plot? Bourne was chased from here to there, from beginning to end. That's the plot. Don't look for anything deeper than this. 2) Cinematography? - Do me a favor! Any 7 year old armed with an old and battered 8mm movie camera would do a far better job (I am not exaggerating here). This film is a tour-de-force of astonishingly amateurish camera-work. The ridiculous shaking of EVERY (I really do mean every) scene will cause dizziness and nausea. 3) Believable? - Oh yes definitely. This is a masterpiece of credibility. I loved scenes about Bourne being chased by (local) police through the winding market streets of Tangier. - I've BEEN to Tangier. Even the guides can't navigate their way through those streets but Bourne shook off 100 police with speed and finesse. Greengrass must be laughing his head off at the gullibility of his film disciples. 4) Editing? - I don't know what the editor was on when he did this film but I want some! - Every scene is between 0.5 and 2 seconds. I felt nauseous at the end of the film from the strobe effect of the ""scenes"" flashing by. 5) Directing? - Hmmm. This is an interesting aspect. The film appears to have actually NOT had any directing. More a case of Greengrass throwing a copy of the script (all two pages) at the cameramen and told to ""shoot a few scenes whilst drunk"". - ""Don't worry boys, we'll tie the scenes together in the editing room"". The editor should be tarred, feathered and put in the stocks for allowing this monstrosity to hit the silver screen 6) Not one but TWO senior CIA operatives giving the tender feminine treatment to the mistreated and misunderstood Jason Bourne. - Putting their lives on the line for someone they couldn't even be sure wasn't a traitor. Talk about stupid nincompoops. (Whilst the evil male CIA members plot to terminate any operative who so much as drops a paper-clip on the floor). (well, all men are evil, aren't they? - Except for SNAGS of course). Yes, this really is a modern and politically correct film that shows the females to be the heroes of the day and the oppressive males as the real threat to humanity. 7) When the you-know-what finally hits the fan, good triumphs over evil (just like it always does, eh?) and the would-be assassin gets the drop on Jason Bourne - he suddenly undergoes a guilt trip and refrains from pulling the trigger (Yeah - right...) - at that very moment, the evil deputy director just happens to turn up - gun in hand and he does pull the trigger. - How did this 60 year old man run so fast and not even be out of breath? Wonders will never cease 8) Don't worry, there's a senate hearing and the baddies get pulled up before the courts. Well, we can't have nasty, politically incorrect, CIA operatives going round shooting people, can we? How lovely to see a true to life P.C. film of the Noughties. -------------The Bourne Ultimatum is utter rubbish.",2007

4,Users who have rated this movie so highly simply can't have seen enough good films to compare it with. Have they all been brainwashed?? I have rarely felt so disappointed by a film and some of that must be attributable to the ridiculous hype surrounding this movie.,2007
1,"The Bourne Ultimatum is the worse of the franchise. It is a shame that Ludlum's last Bourne novel has been transformed to a motion picture that has as much clarity as a bug being squished on a cars windshield. The plot is perhaps the thinnest of any of the Bourne movies, and the audience is at best bored with the whole experience. But the most annoying, madding, is the cinematography by Wood, is like a film being filmed by the Road Runner on Crack, jumpy, blurry, and headache inducing. The film may have been worth viewing, if the audience could see what was going on. But with the shaky cam of this debacle being bad enough, but even the action scenes were filmed way to close in for anyone to follow what was going on in this picture. See this if you must, but bring your aspirin.",2007
1,"I don't understand people. Why is it that this movie is getting an 8.3!!!!!!???? I had high hopes for this movie, but once i was about a half hour into it I just wanted to leave the theater. In the vast majority of the reviews on this site people are saying that this is one of the best action movies they've seen (or of the summer, year, etc.) They say it's an excellent conclusion. WTF!!!!!!!!!?????? What has been concluded (besides the fact that Bourne can ride motorcycles, shoot, and fight better than anyone else he comes across)? What do you learn about Bourne's character in this movie?????????Absolutely f****** nothing!!!!!!! Okay, there's a lot of action, but what's so great about the action in this movie?? I don't like the cinematography and film editing. The shaky camera effect and fast changing shots were used TOO much and they get old fast (I didn't mind them in Supremacy because it was still easy to follow and was not used in excess) and made me quite dizzy. I was quickly wishing I had saved my $$$ for something else.",2007
1,This movie should have had Dramamine available at the door. This was the most disturbingly incorrectly filmed movie I can remember. It should have been filmed during an earthquake so maybe the motion could have canceled out some of the totally unnecessary camera movement. This ranks right up there with the Blair Witch Project for filming techniques that should never ever be incorporated into a motion picture. I think Paul G did not understand that the motion in motion picture means the pictures move not the camera. I was so unbelievably aggravated with the motion that I couldn't get into the movie or the characters. Paul G's interpretation of celluloid will never be seen by my eyes again. I should have known to stay away when I learned they brought him on again from the second installment of this supposed trilogy. The whole experience is ruined by the filming and directing of this movie. Make sure you are motion sickness proofed before viewing.,2007
7,"The Bourne Identity, The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum; explosive and action packed!!! The whole trilogy is so fast paced it doesn't feel like you've watched a full length Hollywood film. If you are a fan of action films then you haven't seen anything until you've seen all three of the Bourne Trilogy. I've seen The Bourne Trilogy so many times and it still impresses me. It's just an exciting ride watching all these different events take place behind our backs; im talking agents, spys, kingpins...Jason Bourne is the ultimate bad ass! The theme tune 'Extreme Ways' to these films is well suited as it's really, well cool; it just sounds amazing and it's really exciting when you hear it playing in the climax of the film. I want a fourth installment!",2010
8,"This film was very good. A great family movie with the only purpose of entertaining people with that unique touch that only Disney can give. It has a very simple yet enjoyable story about a famous football player who's life is all about football, parties, women and his dog apparently a very good life but also a very lonely one when someday a girl appears at his door telling that he is her dad and there's where he must learn how to be a parent and at the same time to live. The cast is good. The Rock proves that he is more than an action hero, he also can do comedy in a very good way, the little girl Madison Pettis is so cute and his acting is great, she looks very natural. Roselyn Sanchez delivers a good supporting role as the girl's ballet teacher and Kyra Sedgwick although it was a short performance it was also very convincing. In conclusion, a very good family that you will enjoy",2007
9,"This was a thoroughly enjoyable family movie. Saw it with my wife and 10 year old son and we all had a great time. The Rock is improving as an actor and was quite funny, especially in the Ballet... The little girl was very cute. The humor was squeaky clean and the message was clear and sweet. Loved it. Kyra Sedwick was funny in places which I'm not used to seeing. The supporting cast of football players was well done. There isn't much football in the movie so it won't turn off non-athletes. I think the Rock's charm will continue to drive his career as he is able to always bring the charm while pulling off the tough male ego.",2007
10,"We saw this tonight. It was wonderful. My husband took one look at all the little girls seated in the theater and said, ""Did you choose the right movie?"" But he laughed from start to finish, as did all the other men in the theater.",2007
7,"OK, I know that The Game Plan was very cheesy and extremely predictable, but who cares? What were people expecting? It's Disney, it's supposed to be this kind of a film. I saw The Game Plan with my friend yesterday and we both liked it, we got a few laughs from it and it was over all a well made movie. We were both very impressed with the little actress, Madison Pettis, who played The Rock's daughter, she was incredibly believable and didn't over do her role or was too cute that it made you sick. The script may not be Oscar material, but it was perfect for a family film and the story while it may not be the most original, still had it's funny and touching moments.",2007
8,"Well, I got to see this tonight as a sneak preview. I went in excited because the trailer cracked me up and wasn't disappointed. It was cute. Some of the lines are corny but some of it was serious stuff. You get to see some emotion from Johnson. The beginning cracks you up, you see this guy basically in love with himself trying to make it to the big one of his football career when he has a little girl thrust upon him. He doesn't know what to do, how to handle her. I think that the background relationship with his father could have been fleshed out a little better,you only get a hint of it, but otherwise it was a good movie. Some of the parts are HILARIOUS!! The little girl in the movie has got definite attitude and it cracked me up. Overall it was a decent movie, a good one to see.",2007
8,"In ""The Game Plan"" after being high-jacked to the mall by his 8 year-old daughter Peyton (adorable Madison Pettis) and her ballerina crew, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson as Superstar Quarterback Joe Kingman is held captive at a ""Make Your Own Doll"" shop. Roselyn Sanchez as Peyton's ballet instructor Monique arrives to the rescue. ""The Rock"", crammed in children's chair, is combing out the hair of the doll he made. ""The Rock"" humbly tells Monique, ""Thanks for saving me"" Joe wistfully concedes that he is not at all good at thisbeing a Dad. Monique reminds him that women being better anyway, are better at this sort of thing. Then in a touching admission, she tells Joe that fathers are important in that they teach daughters courage, and ""They make us brave."" Director Andy Fickman's ""The Game Plan"" is surprisingly both touching and sweet. Sentimental is a givenif you have a problem with that, you need to crawl back under a rock, because the sunshine emerges shamelessly in ""The Game Plan"". ""The Game Plan"" works, because of The Rock's undeniable charm, and his natural chemistry with Madison Pettis.",2007
8,Big Joe Kingman is living the all-American dream: he's a superstar quarterback and living large. His team loves him and big sponsorships are flowing thick and fast.,2007
10,"I was a child of the 1960s, and grew up seeing many of those classic Walt Disney films when originally released. After Walt Disney passed away, the Disney films decades later didn't seem to have that same feel to them. ""The Game Plan"" seems like one of those classic Disney films from the 60s, but up to date rather than in days gone by. I saw a Sneak Preview on Saturday. In ""The Game Plan,"" Boston Quarterback Joe Kingman is quite surprised when he suddenly learns that he has a 6 year old daughter from a previous marriage. It is a story on how his life changes from the playboy lifestyle of perhaps the most eligible bachelor in the NFL to that of a high profile dad. It's a light hearted comedy. My call on ""The Game Plan"" is that it will be #1 at the Box Office this weekend. It's a good movie. Go see it.",2007
8,"Personally, it was the trailers that made me want to see this movie from the start. Let's get serious, this was not supposed to be 'Shindler's List' or something. It's a comedy about a football player! If anyone expected anything more they were deluded from the start. ""The Rock"" was very decent in this role, but he wasn't supposed to be the superstar of the film, just the superstar of the team -- that a big difference. Pettis was amazing, as was Kyra Sedgwick. And the team...the team of knucklehead football players stole the show in every scene they were in. The comedy had its slapstick moments but for the most part it was heartfelt and warm. I took my 7 and 6 year old daughters to see and they loved it. Definitely a must-see family film and certainly a DVD buy!",2007
9,"I went to see this as a chaperone for kids on a camp day field trip. I must say it is one of Disney's best recent films. a lot of Disney's movies today are corny and boring, and not funny at all. This is a major exception. This a great family film the whole family will enjoy. The idea of a young girl being thrust upon a parent who doesn't even know about her is not original, but the setting is pretty cool in this film.",2007
10,Everyone knew the Rock could act but this was a major stretch that he handled amazingly. The cast was terrific and the chemistry between him and Madison was adorable. I think what I liked best was the story line. Disney actually branched out with something different and gave it a wonderful cast. There's a lot more to this then meets the eye so don't just judge it but the trailer or reviews go decide for yourself. It was a treat to sit there and watch this. It's one of those movies you look forward to seeing and it doesn't disappoint. The dog especially is one reason to see this because it's adorable and played a big role in a way. The music was great Elvis all the way and Yes the Rock can sing. Recommended for anyone who likes a great family movie!~!,2007
8,I didn't expected much from this movie but it did surprise me.,2007
8,"Just came back from taking five kids to see this movie. The plan had been to send the kids in to watch a kids movie and for us adults to watch something else but this was the only movie on at that time, so we all watched it. Both my friend and I were pleasantly surprised that we quite enjoyed what we really thought would be an atrocious film. Story line is pretty basic, egotistical self-centered football superstar dealing with the fact that his marriage that ended eight years ago produced a child who takes it upon herself to come and stay with him (unbeknownst to her mother who thinks she is away on ballet camp) Footballer hero has to deal with the realities of parenthood in a hurry and does a damn fine job of it despite a few initial hiccups. Despite everybody thinking that the kid would be ""a distraction"" to his game, what proves to be the worst distraction is the possibility of losing her again, and in the end he chooses his daughters heart over a super big commercial deal. No, it wasn't mind-blowingly unpredictable or anything, but it was good family comedy with a touch of tear-jerky reality that made me wanna hug my kids when I came out from the cinema. If more people realized that their kids were the best thing that ever happened to them the the world would probably be a much nicer place to live. I'd give it 8/10 bedazzled stars!",2007
7,"American football team Boston Rebels' star quarterback Joe Kingman (The Rock) has only two loves in his life - Football and Elvis Presley. Like all successful sports superstars at the top of their game, he's living the good life, with his swanky penthouse apartment fitted with the latest luxuries, a sportster that screams ""Mo Jo(e)"", and endless parties with beautiful women. But alas one fine day he finds little Peyton Kelly (Madison Pettis) at his doorstep, claiming to be his daughter, and thus putting the brakes in his fast life.",2007
9,"The Game plan was awesome. I hope that daughters and fathers will watch this movie. Lots of smiles. Laughter and tears. The movie reminded my how important a father and daughter relationships should be. Life is too short to let a relationship pass you by. With so many split families and mothers leaving the fathers, with out the children is very difficult. The acting in this movie was great and very true. The dancing and the football relationship was put together very well too. I would recommend this movie for all to see. I would watch it again. I went with my son but I would love to go with my daughter too. keep the hope alive dads. and keep that relationship with you daughters all their lives. Let them know how much you love them always.",2007
10,"Joe Kingman (The Rock, Dwayne Johnson) is a hotshot quarterback for the Boston Rebels. He is a great player, in truth, but he is pretty darn self-centered and has never acquired a championship ring. He lives and breathes football, mostly, but loves Elvis and women, too. One day, at his ultimate bachelor pad, a pre-teen girl shows up at his door, telling him that she is his daughter, Peyton. She provides the proof, so there is no denying the connection. As Peyton must stay for a month, Joe resigns himself to looking after her. However, he has much to learn about bedtimes, ballet, bubble baths, and more. Yet, surprisingly, he forms a strong bond with his daughter. Will it last? This is one of Disney best efforts, ever, absolutely. It is funny, touching, and relevant, all at the same time. Johnson is wonderful as the full-of-himself footballer who must learn some of life's most important lessons very quickly. Madison Pettis, playing Peyton, is also quite nice, with Kyra Sedgwick, Morris Chestnut, Roselyn Sanchez and others backing them up with humor and skill. The script is amazing, alternating between high humor and sweetness, and never faltering on its way to a nice ending. As for the costumes, scenery, and cinematography, they are terrific, making for a film that looks most lovely. If you are in search of a great family film, do make a personal game plan to show this movie to your loved ones very soon. It will bring down the house and give everyone a much-needed reason to feel good about life again. More than that, it may teach those closest to us some important lessons about loving each other every day, no matter what the situation. Oh, and look out for the darling credits, where everyone sings along with Elvis' ""Burning Love""!",2007

This one I can say THANK YOU for making such a great movie. I am not one to buy a lot of movies, but when we got out of the movie, we agreed this one will be put on the to purchase list when it is released! THE Rock is just great! Madison is just so cute, funny. All the cast are wonderful in this movie.....can't leave out anyone of them. Go see for yourself and get your pre movie errands complete, ie.. popcorn, drinks, bathroom runs LOL kids love em. You don't want to miss any of this show! J <><",2007
9,"Great movie! My children loved it and I thought it was very entertaining as well. This movie offers a little bit of everything, comedy, sports, a bulldog, ballet, a small love plot,and a happy ending. It is not as predictable as you would think. Although there is not much football playing in this movie. References are made to football and there are a lot of locker room scenes, but not much playing time. The whole time you are watching the movie you might think you have it figured out, but you probably don't. Enjoyable for adults and kids. If you liked Daddy Day Care this movie is better. I have a new found respect for the Rock and the little girl is adorable.",2007
9,"I took my little cousin to see this movie yesterday and absolutely loved it. It was great to see The Rock playing in a soft roll and actually being able to see his acting abilities. I went into this movie thinking I was going to fall asleep, but I ended up laughing the entire time. Also I cried during the end when Peyton decides to go home, and I cried again when she came back. It was great when he gave up 25 million dollars just to say he was taking his daughter home. It shows he had completely transformed. I don't usually buy movies on DVD, but I will defiantly consider buying this one. The only reason why I didn't give it a ten was because it took a while to explain what was actually going on and if you weren't paying attention, you would definitely be confused. But overall, GREAT MOVIE!",2007
8,This is a pretty funny movie. I like the fact that Dwayne Johnson is secure enough that he can play a role like this. After all how often do you see a macho hero type like him in a pink tutu? Madison Pettis is a treat as the unknown daughter that just shows up on Johnson's doorstep. A daughter he did not know he had. The humor and jokes are really good. The all pro football star quarterback who is a bit conceited to say the least actually starts to grow as a person when he must take care of this unexpected present. He starts to learn about parental responsibility and how to interact with someone who is not a woman looking for a one night stand or a man especially a pro athlete. When his daughter has peanuts and has an allergic reaction things hit the fan and he finally grows all the way up. I like this movie.,2013
10,"This was a very entertaining and funny movie, I taught the Rock and Madison Pettis had great chemistry and there was nonstop fun. If you don't see this movie you are missing great family entertainment at a time when wholesome family values are at an all time low.Go see this movie and you will feel that this movie is going to be a Disney classic, I cannot believe that anyone would give this movie less than a 9. I hope to see Madison Pettis in more movies ,she is a cute adorable little girl and has such a great persona on the screen. The Rock is such a huge figure and he did a great job in this family film and showed how loves can change anyone to become a less selfish person.",2007
2,"Taking a hard-boiled action movie star out of his element has long been a favorite premise of Hollywood. This is usually accomplished by taking said star, and then teaming them up with either a cute child or animal. The Game Plan has learned its lessons well, as it teams up its star, wrestler turned actor Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, with both a cute child and an animal. What the movie has not learned is how to present any ideas or anything new to go with it. This isn't just by the book film-making, this is a Frankenstein's Monster built of the clichés handed down over the years.",2007
8,"I saw this movie last night with my older sister and her two daughters. I have had a keen interest in everything the Rock has been doing in terms of Hollywood, and I think he has finally showed us that he is more then a bucolic muscle head with the ability to raise his eye brow in a funny way. Johnson has come a long way from his train wreck appearance in The Scorpion King, and I believe has now established himself as one of the better commodities sitting in Hollywood today. For me, I believe he really started to break free in the Rundown, and just continued to get better and better from Walking Tall, DOOM, and Gridiron Gang as well as his hysterical portrayal in Be Cool. The Game Plan allows Johnson to display his complete array of acting skills with a script that is actually surprisingly well written. The movie is very cute, and I think guys could see this without feeling that their masculinity is being threatened for seeing a ""chick flick"", but it would definitely be something to take the kids to. The humour is light-hearted, and constant at that. I was absolutely roaring with laughter through the entire movie. But it allows generates several very heart wrenching scenes in which I actually found myself wiping a tear or two away. All in all, this is Johnson's best showing yet, and in my opinion, one of the best movie's of the year. I fully recommend this movie to anyone and I'll be happy to see it again and own it when it comes out.",2007
2,"I really enjoyed the first film. The characters were real, they made understandable decisions in stressful situations. It was a fresh take on a very cliché genera; zombie films.",2007
1,"28 Weeks Later has to be the most disappointing sequel I've ever seen. This review will contain spoilers, however, it's nothing that the filmmakers themselves haven't spoiled to start with. Let's start with the most fundamental element of film-making: camera work. 28 Weeks Later is one of those pretentious films with the epileptic, hand-held camera that seems so popular with filmmakers who have nothing to actually say or show in their films. There are precious few scenes where the camera isn't both hand-held and in constant frenetic motion. It brings nothing to the film, creates no tension, and brings nothing new to the art of film-making. There are lengthy scenes that compound the camera work problem by also being filmed in simulated night vision. For those of you with a propensity to headaches or vision problems, this alone makes 28 Weeks Later a film to avoid.",2007
1,This film sucks. The director used only one shooting style. Shaky-cam.,2007
1,"I'm open to believe the U.S. Army is stupid- but THAT stupid? How do 2 kids get out of the ""safe"" zone and manage to steal a moped, ride through London, hang out at their house, and meet their mother before the Army can catch up with them? The purpose of putting the safe zone on an island in London was for containment (I assume) and yet, the survivors AND the zombies are able to walk across a bridge to get off the island AFTER it's been fire bombed? I am able to guess the mother's genetic eye-color trait is linked to the genetic anomaly that makes her and her kid immune- how does the idiot doctor not figure it out? Is the medical director really so stupid as to not guess these kids could be current hosts- is she really so stupid as to whisk the two kids away without checking their blood- and wouldn't doing a full work up on both kids be required when they were first caught? Is she so stupid as to risk her life to get these two kids out of Britain who can be carriers, like their mother was a carrier? And really... the father's reaction when he finds out his wife is alive... this is a man who should have severe PTSD (the entire survival population should have PTSD)... and he saw his entire nation succumb to this virus and yet he is ready to believe that his wife comes out of an attack unscathed? And then he sneaks through security to see her???!! Really??! And again back to the stupid U.S. Army-- you'd think security in that place would have been better...I get that he had ""all access"" pass, I just think the Army would have guards around too.",2007
1,Horror movies are about scaring people. There are basically two ways to do this physically and psychologically.,2007
8,"Having seen 28 Days Later I thought I was prepared for this, but I was not. Somewhere near the beginning of the film is a scene that goes from zero to psycho in about 2 seconds flat. The beginning of 2004's Dawn of the Dead also had a wildly chaotic kick-off scene, but unlike that film, which was a great film to laugh through while chomping your popcorn, this film is no laughing matter.

3,"The movie begins in the dead center of the original outbreak of the epidemic in England. We are introduced to a handful of people hiding out from the rage-infected including Robert Carlyle's character and his wife. After a short time, the house is attacked and most of the group killed by the zombie-like masses. The husband and wife are separated and he flees to water, barely escaping with his life.",2007
3,"Does anyone remember the old TV series ""Threes Company"" with John Ritter? Each episode was essentially built upon a series of misunderstandings that were eventually resolved in thirty minutes. This film has a similar structure, except we are watching the containment of a lethal virus which threatens all of mankind. In one sequence after another the actions of the actors is unbelievably foolish. First the viewer is supposed to believe that anyone would want to return to London after such horrendous events occurred. Then, how may I ask, do two children sneak out of the safe ""green zone"" they are protected in, and travel miles out into the forbidden and potentially infected zone? This isn't equal to sneaking in or out of the theater you visited to see this film, it's on par with sneaking out of Gitmo (or at least it should be). OK so fine, the viewer might let this slide even though the whole time they watch this portion of the film you are filled with disgust because of the stupidity of the characters actions, as well as the improbability that such an escape could occur. Moving on to only minutes later in the film, the two children discover there mother, whom they assumed was dead, looking very infected in their former home. She is brought back to the quarantined medical facility along with the children and tests positive for the virus. Now the next frustrating and improbable leap. The children's father ""visits"" the restrained mother inside the ""secure"" medical facility, swiping a security card through door after door until he is able to speak with her, without anyone in the facility knowing or being alerted to his presence. We are asked to believe that the same card he used to get in and out of his living quarters can somehow grant him access to the most sensitive areas of the medical facility. Also we are expected to believe that there is NO security guarding this woman even though she has been confirmed to carry the virus. We all know what happens next as the father becomes infected and the new outbreak spreads. Onto the next unthinkable wrinkle in the plot. As the infected and uninfected alike run screaming from the facility out into the street the armed forces are asked to target and shoot ONLY the infected. The snipers are supposed to make instantaneous distinctions between those who are healthy and those infected in a fraction of a second? The truth is that everyone running from that facility would be cut down like weeds to prevent ANYONE from leaving the building (which the higher command eventually decides to do much later than was reasonable to do so) It is only through blindly accepting the stupidity of the characters as well as the utter improbability that these characters can go and do as they please, to places they are not supposed to be, that any enjoyment can be achieved. Let's face it, the film may enjoyable on some level, for various reasons, but if you have a hard time with these obvious stretches of reality it becomes difficult to fully enjoy the rest of the film. I enjoyed the first film immensely, and I am well aware that stretches of reality are not uncommon in the horror genre, but this movie just goes too far. I have omitted a continual string of ridiculous plot turns and unthinkable character behavior that follows the breach of the virus because I feel it compassionate to do so. Those who give this film high marks in my opinion are purely giving credit for the minimum. Of course Horror films are not always judged the same as their dramatic counterparts, but viewers have developed a more sophisticated and discerning view of horror films. 28 Days later is responsible for helping lift the expectations of horror fans, this film lowers the bar. I am now going to wander off by myself in the dark, towards the summer camp lake, knowing there is a madman on the loose killing my friends in an attempt to forget this sad sequel. Wish me luck. It might take me 28 months and dismemberment to do so.",2007
2,"28 Days Later was one of the smartest ""horror"" films I had ever seen when it came out, but its sequel pales in comparison. Someone has paralleled the comparison between Alien and Aliens, but I think it's even worse than that. This film will definitely find its audience, much like Aliens did. But whereas Alien and 28 Days Later are scary yet smart, Aliens and 28 Weeks Later are given the Hollywood face-lift with the help of lots of machine guns and overacting. Oh, and a worthless plot.",2007
3,"SPOILER _ _SPOILER _ _ SPOILER I am surprised to see so many positive reviews for 28 weeks later, as in my opinion it bares little comparison to its excellent predecessor.",2007
1,"Well, here we are again. The zombies are back after being quelled. It would have been terrific is the writers devised a clever way to revive the extinguished plague. Instead the absurd plot posits that two bratty idiot kids bring about the 2nd zombie outbreak; that their half-zombie mom is the vessel; and that their dad (her husband) who happens to be the guy running the safe zone is the first full-on zombie, with an alpha security clearance. It's nice that they could keep the entire plot in the family. It's like Dickens' lost zombie novel where everyone (again...) turns out to be related.",2007
1,My biggest problem with this movie is the total lapse of logic. Here's a list of the things I thought were absolutely stupid about this movie.,2007
9,...Not this time.,2007
1,"Where to start. The most ridiculous thing is the father character getting into a top security area (well you would think so) with his silly swipe card. Not one guard to be seen. I gave up on this junk then and there. He then kisses his wife, yuck. In reality she would have told him to sod off, he left her to die! Then he kills his wife, who is also a zombie. He must have had something against her eyes. Then he waltzes on out, and kills some heavily armed (you would imagine) soldiers. Surely, they would have blown his head off. Soldiers are trained to kill, end of story. The kids getting out of the security zone? Beggars belief, what a load of utter crap!!! This film is shite. Well it had good sound anyway, on my 5.1 digital sound system. The copter pilot only being able to pick them up from a park, at a certain time, a great distance away? The only reason for this is so there was plenty of space to fly in and do the giant lawnmower scene with his chopper. Yay!!! How this film is a 7.2 on the ratings scale defies belief. It shows you that the majority of earthlings are brain dead retards, who will accept any crap thrown at them. The Volvo out-maneuvering the attack helicopter? The U.S spends billions of dollars on attack helicopter research and development, yet a clapped out car can out-run and out-maneuver it. Why don't the military just put a rotor blade on the car roof, would save a bit of cash. Perhaps the crew could have fired arrows at the car, or maybe chased it on a horse. I want one of daddys miracle swipe cards, perhaps I could access other peoples bank accounts. This is what is wrong with the U.S military, their stuff don't work . Bombing didn't work, then the gas attack didn't work. What kind of gas was that anyway, zyklon B? Also, the inside of Wembley stadium is actually the Millennium stadium in Cardiff. What an atrocious lead up to another sequel (just what we need) Gee, lets take the kids to France. We no like those frogs. I think it was done on purpose. Why not fly them to Ireland, it is closer, and is also separated by a large body of water. What a bollocking, cluster, turgid, mindless, retarded piece of crap. Who is the screenwriter? Bring back the black list. Well, thats enough of me ranting. Thank you for reading this far. If you want to rent a good comedy, this is it.",2007
1,This film was so awful it made me write this review to warn others.,2007
9,"I've never been a huge fan of the zombie horror genre, but I was very impressed by Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later Somehow it managed to create characters worth caring about as well as throwing mindless zombies at them. So when I heard that a sequel was in the making, I was excited but understandably cautious since the Disappointing Sequel Syndrome is all too common nowadays. I also disapproved of the director switch, fearing that yet another low-budget gem will be Americanised by Hollywood, made far too slick for its own good.",2007
8,"When I first heard there was to be a sequel to Danny Boyle's excellent 28 Days Later and that Boyle himself would not be directing it, I was less than excited.",2007
9,When I heard there was going to be a sequel to 28 DAYS LATER I slammed my cards on the table and proclaimed that this was going to be one of the biggest disasters in the history of recent cinema . Despite the flaws of 28 DL - And there was many - it was at least an attempt to make an intelligent post apocalyptic adventure in the vein of John Wyndham or John Christopher even though the end result was unsatisfactory but a sequel ! That's just a case of a film becoming a franchise isn't it ? It's made simply to make a profit for some film company and after hearing that the story revolves around those damn Americans saving limey butt once again I just knew I'd be watching OBJECTIVE BURMA crossbred with a generic zombie film . Give me some credit for putting my head on the block but I'm going to have to eat my words because I saw 28 WEEKS LATER earlier tonight and I was totally engrossed for the entire running time ,2007

10,"This I can honestly say is not an overstatement. The movie contained everything it needed to be become a classic horror movie. It had gore, emotion,a few jumps,and action all the way through. The movie starts off well with the jumps and the pulse pounding action. Then all calms for a second, only to pick up again and faster.",2007

They should of stuck with the original producers and filmers.",2007
8,"Given that this time of year normally gives way to three-quels, kid friendly fayre or brainless blockbusters it's nice to have a proper 18 certificate horror film we can all go and see - without the worry of horror-lite 12A Hollywood horror, or 'lets try to gross out as much as possible' Hostel-a-like films.",2007
1,"Better or as good as the first one...that's what I have been hearing. Those people obviously didn't go to the movie at all. Horrible inconsistencies, a story that goes nowhere but to a 3rd movie and cliché horror movie scenes aplenty. It was so distant from the movie goers it felt like watching a passing train. I don't know how anyone could say this is a good movie or even holds a candle to the first one. Not true. Yes, there was tension in 28 Weeks Later but that is all! And that is not enough to keep watchers involved. ",2007
8,"I didn't expect a lot from 'Beowulf', for lots of reasons, most of which were to do with the casting: incorrigibly cockney Ray Winstone as a warrior from what's now southern Sweden; wacky John Malkovich as a cynical counselor; loony Crispin Glover as a flesh-rending monster, and weirdest of all, Angelina Jolie as the monster's mother...thaet waes wundorlic castyng, as the poet might have put it. Then there was the way they did the whole thing in CGI, running the risk of making it all look a bit rubbery. Finally, Robert Zemeckis is the director and my great respect for him plummeted through the floor and into the crawlspace after he presided over the insufferable 'Forrest Gump'.",2008
1,"This film has impressive special effects and would be okay as an adventure fantasy but it should not be marketed as the epic poem.Also it has been given the wrong rating and should be an R. Why all the changes? Grendel's mother was not a gold painted,nude,Barbie doll in stiletto heels.Grendel was not Hrothgar's son. Beowulf killed the witch he did not have sex with her.The dragon was not Beowulf's son and had no connection with the witch.Beowulf was not made Hrothgar's heir,nor did he marry his widow and become king of the Danes.In the poem Beowulf returned to Geatland after slaying Grendel. He remained the Geat king's best warrior,supporting him and the son who succeeded him. Only after the new king died did Beowulf become king of the Geats until his own death in later years.Also, why all the nudity in this film? This was Scandinavian northern Europe in the Dark Ages - folk would have Bean in furs and heavy woollens most of the time.The cartoon-like actors didn't help either with bland faces and expressionless eyes.",2007

I was unsure what to expect, however I ended up leaving the cinema extremely satisfied with the film, and tellingly, unable to stop discussing it long after the ride home.",2007
9,"This movie is a lot of fun. In 3D. I suspect its impact will be considerably diminished in 2D, so I urge anyone who wants to see it to seek out the 3D version. There are lots of beautifully constructed tracking shots where the camera glides and swirls forward, back up and down, and trees, rocks, arrows, dragons or whatever slip past the edges of the frame, and this effect is stunning in 3D. In fact, all the action scenes are stunning in 3D, particularly the climactic battle with a top-notch, fire belching monster of a dragon.",2007
1,"For over 1000 years Beowulf the epic has described Beowulf as a mighty hero who killed Grendel AND Grendel's mother. He became a mighty King in his own right after protecting the existing incumbent and his son. At the end of a life of courage and honesty he sets out to fight one last battle, KNOWING he may be going to his death but willing to protect his people for one last time. During the final battle with the Fire spewing serpent, Beowulf was losing, but one of his companions remembered his duty and where others deserted Beowulf, Wiglaf returned to stand by his dying lord, shielding him and dealing a stroke that abated the Serpent's fire, enabling Beowulf to deal the death stroke to the serpent with his battle knife. Finally after the death of the serpent, and the subsequent death of his dear lord from his wounds, Wiglaf berates the cowards who deserted their lord and made them feel their shame.",2007
7,"I have read Beowulf a couple of times. It's great northern European mythology, and mandatory reading when you are young in my opinion (Along with Norse, Greek and Roman Mythology as well). And though the movie wants to re-write some of the epic, you will need to separate the Hollywood version from the beautiful measure of the original works. Being a work of CGI, you will also have to allow for the flaws of pure CGI work. Very stylized and beautifully colored, it is an epic adventure that elevated Zemeckis' previous work ""The Polar Express"" to a new level. Polar was beautifully modeled after Chris Van Allsburg illustrations for his book, but Zemeckis' adaptation to the story went a little over the top when it became a musical. Even though most of Beowulf's story line is answered here, it did make me pause and wonder:",2007

Works alright, the flick, as long as you don't take it seriously. However, whenever the Shrek""-Elements dominate the scene, the film runs into problems. Queen Wealtheow for instance fatally resembles the green Oger's mom. Besides, almost all Characters have a squint that would make Christopher Lambert at his best look good. Wet hair is still a problem of computer-graphics, too. Otherwise, the film is technically well made and gives you an idea how far Ralph Bakshi might have gone with his concept of graphically alienated live-action.",2007
8,"Just this minute got back from seeing a free preview of Beowulf and OH MY GOD! This is a cracking film and I highly recommend everyone goes to the cinema to see it (it's a cinema experience for sure!). Not only that, but it's 3D (which I wasn't aware of) or rather the all new 3D (no more red/green glasses). Everyone in the audience was given what looked like cheap-ass shades, but they did the job wonderfully and fitted snugly over my regular specs.",2007
6,*The following is a review of the digital 3D version showing at select theaters: ,2007
1,"I was excited that now, with CGI, a great epic tale like Beowulf might be successfully made into a movie. I will keep waiting for a responsible screenwriter and director to try this again. First of all, I thought there would be more live action/acting. Since this had such a lovely cast list, I assumed they would really act. The stilted phrasing and wall to wall sexual innuendos made this one of the worst scripts I have encountered and brought to the screen. Beowulf, the great epic is full of magnificent epic poem, richly enhanced with kennings and alliteration that bring power and dignity to all of the characters. There was no dignity here. Instead, Beowulf was enveloped in shame (and given this script it was, unintentionally, the only thing they got right.) Please people,READ THE BOOK! The only thing this movie had in common with Beowulf were the names of the characters. Say no to bastard children, naked mommies of monsters, and lips that do not match up with the dialog. The only thing I got out of this was true/false test material for my British Literature students who think they can get away with watching the movie instead of reading our text.",2007
6,"It seems we have a new cinematic fad coming into fashion... the genre of mythological action. It began with '300' (a film I really enjoyed), and the first that stands to benefit from 300's success is Beowulf. Beowulf is the newest film from Robert Zemeckis. Zemeckis implements many of the same visual themes of his last project, the heart warming Polar Express, with varied success.",2007
1,"Short answer: If you love the old Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf, do not see this movie. You will be nauseated.",2007
1,"Beowulf is among the greatest and most well-known epic tales of Norse Mythology, but it only took me five minutes into the movie to realize that this film was not even close to as something grand. Why? To my surprise and disappointment, this movie was animated. Sure, animation isn't a big deal for a film along the lines of Shrek or Ratatouille, but not for a story like Beowulf. Beowulf is a very serious tale that covers many topics such as vengeance and forgiveness, cruelty and mercy, curses and revelations. I admit, this movie has some of those aspects, but it rather focuses on a corny, stylish animation work.",2007
1,"To all who have seen the movie and read the book, then I am sorry. To those who didn't read the book: The writers of the film did not follow the story line at all. Beowulf was supposed to pull of Grendel's arm, not shut it in a door. Grendel's mother was supposed to have lived in a lake of fire and be an ugly hag. Beowulf was also supposed to kill her, not make a dragon child with her. Grendel's mother was only supposed to kill one man when she comes to Herot, not all of Beowulf's men. And Hrothgar never gave Beowulf his kingdom. Beowulf had his own. Beowulf, after a long, unsuccessful battle with the dragon, was supposed to have died, not having killed the dragon and Wiglaf ended up defeating it. I cannot give this movie high ratings because of its twisting of the original story, which disappointed almost everyone in that theater.",2007
9,"I have never had the experience of seeing a 3-D movie before on the cinema, the only experience I have had with a 3-d film, only courtesy of some 3-d glasses coming free with a DVD, was Spy Kids 3-D, a movie while mildly entertaining isn't exactly the best film every to display the greatness of 3-d. So Beowulf today was my first 3-d experience, I went in expecting something good because of the 3-d, but I didn't expect the movie itself to be superb. Part of my reasoning behind this was because of the one and only experience I had had with Zemeckis and his new way of making movies. That movie was unfortunately the Polar Express, a supposedly happy tail that actually freaked me out more than most horror movies! So what an absolute delight to say that Beowulf not only works because of it being in 3-D (more on that brilliant factor later) but also the movie is a genuinely brilliant movie anyway. The motion capture isn't remotely creepy this time round and actually it seemed to make sense in some bizarre way as to why they did the movie like this. The actors surprised me big time, Ray Winstone delivering actually one of his best performances in a long while, Angelina Jolie playing the slinky seductress to perfection and Anthony Hopkins being a joy to watch on screen. Beowulf is an action packed, well written and entertaining piece of popcorn cinema. Just watch the dragon sequence near the end, every single person in my cinema was on the edges of their seat and looked in awe. The action sequences just amaze, and the dialogue sequences surprisingly really work as well. Unfortunately however if you see this movie in 2-D then you will not be experiencing Beowulf in my eyes, take off the 3-D this is a 9/10 movie, with the 3-D it gets the 10/10 rating with a blink of an eye.",2007
1,"As far as movies go, this one has what is popular: action, adventure, sex, blood, and lots of twists that will keep you guessing what the truth is.",2007
9,"And I loved it. The creators of this little gem have far more potent imaginations than I and I envy them that. What a rousing movie! I picked it up in DVD to fill up an evening while my wife was away and what a pleasure it was to get engrossed in this brilliantly told tale of courage and adventure. It took me about 30 seconds to get used to the animation. It will take you longer to get used to the idea that this movie actually does a better job evoking a bygone time than the literature on which it's based. That's amazing to me. Another surprise was that Ms Jolie's much ballyhooed nude scenes were more disappointing than I had expected. I found myself more entranced with Robin Wright Penn's Wealthow who is undeservedly undervalued as an indispensable part of this film's magical weave. Ray Winstone rings more true in the lead than anyone had any right to hope for, in my opinion. And then there's Anthony Hopkins and John Malkovich, both adding bits of irrepressible humanity to the mix. This is in sum a thoroughly enjoyable film and I don't hesitate to recommend it, but especially to guys who will have a richer appreciation of it all than I would expect the usual woman will.",2008
1,This is the worst movie I have ever seen and I have seen a lot of movies in my life.,2007
10,"Despite all you might have read, Beowulf does not appear on screen as he was in the poem which was the origin of this incredibly well designed CGI tour-De-force. This, although a shock to some, I'm sure, means little to the vast majority of viewers who either 1 - never heard of this legendary hero in the first place or 2 - would forever picture him as Christopher Lambert in the eponymous, and eminently forgettable, straight-to-DVD movie of some years ago. The truth is, this movie is a spectacle to behold: it grips you from the first scene, wrings you by the seat of your pants and absolutely knocks your socks off at every corner - at least CGI wise. It has its faults, surely, as any masterpiece, but a masterpiece it still is. Some set pieces are not as well rendered as others (the water in the ocean is a blatant example) but others are just plain outstanding and technology-defying (like the last battle of the movie, which I won't reveal here). Ray Winstone (Beowulf) is tremendously convincing, as is the generally under-rated Crispin Glover (Grendel - who, go figure, is no dragon, as other people said) - Sir Anthony Hopkins is very much royalty in his own right (King Hrothgar) and Robin Right Penn, Brendan Gleeson and John Malkovich excel in the little nuances that give supporting role characters their chances at the Oscars - unfortunately, Angelina Jolie's part is both a visual treat and at the same time an auditory shame - very few lines are spoken - it seems seeing her with zero garments was understood to be enough to satisfy the teenage crowds - well, I would certainly have liked for more character development but what the hell, can't really complain. As far as anthropomorphic CGI goes all the main characters are instantly recognizable but not perfect (this is still an evolution over Zemecky's own ""The Polar Express"", mind you) and no matter how much the 3D effects try (and try they do, believe you me), they still seem like gimmicks - the first part of the movie and the cave scenes encompass the best 3D trickery on display - and this new fangled technology is truly superior to the previous red-blue glasses of yesteryear - and will probably leave you with a little less of a hangover afterward. When all is said and done, it stands out on its own merits: epic, comes to mind, and so does cutting edge. This is a movie that will sell a lot of HD hardware (be it BluRay or HD-DVD or whatever else just comes out meanwhile), and sure to be displayed in plasmas and LCD screens all over the world when this movie goes on sale. Go see it now, at theaters, in its original digital form, 3D glasses over your nose and enjoy it for what it is: pure magic.",2007
3,"I saw the film in its 3-D Imax incarnation. I found certain aspects of the film appealing: at the core of the film is a psychological and moral allegory about kingship in a warrior culture committed to offensive warfare for the sake of treasure (hence, the role of Grendel's mother). As such, I don't mind the plot changes from the original poem, which in the end also simultaneously celebrates and critiques the Teutonic warrior ethos.",2007
2,First the good parts: The 3D is spectacular in scenes like the that of the dragon flying and the digitization is good in action sequences though not in facial closeups. I liked the ground level shots of horses riding by .,2007
4,Beowulf has been my personal favorite book ever since I read it. I read it three times now. Every movie I have seen or heard of based off the book was nothing ridiculously bad but you could easily tell why they weren't in theaters and some of them were decent but nothing too exciting.,2007
4,"Visually this film is stunning. More than once I had to remind myself that what I was looking at was not real actors caught on film but a CGI interpretation. It's difficult to purvey this feeling as either a negative or a positive one: on the one hand I cannot see the point in producing CGI if what the filmmaker's goal is realism of reality. CGI in film is of course appropriate when trying to achieve fantastical creatures and set pieces (which are of course inherently unrealistic) but in Beowulf each actor's face, verbal, and non-verbal performance are recreated in CGI verbatim. This I cannot fathom  why recreate what is already there, in the flesh and far more believable? On the other hand there is a sense of true wonder when in a handful of scenes you are genuinely fooled into thinking that what you are looking at is not CGI, but live action film. You are left with no choice but to marvel at the technical and artistic achievements. However, the illusion is inevitably shattered when you begin to pick up on some of the unrealistic lighting, dodgy physics and for some reason: gesticulation (wooden puppets spring to mind). It's really hard to understand what was being attempted with this film: genuine realism (then why recreate the actors in CGI?), complete fantasy immersion (then why are some scenes so tangible?), or (as I suspect) purely an exercise in what is possible with modern CGI.",2008
1,"Beowulf the book is an epic poem. Beowulf the movie is an adaptation of this classic, except with extremely poorly written dialog, an abundance of tit jokes, and everything else you would expect from a Hollywood film. Secret love affair? Check. Jealous rivals? Check. Excessive imagery against Christianity? Check. Nothing quite like having someone burned by a dragon in a church after holding up a cross. Expect to see about four crosses burning in the movie, along with multiple references to the inefficiency of the religion of Jesus Christ.",2007
10,"As it happens more often than not, greatness is relegated to some obscure angle. In a year of brilliant opuses by the Cohen Brothers and PT Anderson, this Tim Burton film shines as the best from every angle. It's not just that Burton creates another superb, dark universe with Dante Ferretti's complicity or that Johnnt Deep breaks new ground, or that Helena Bonham Carter surprises us with a complex, marvelous realistic parody. The film touches visually a very private cord. Ed Wood managed that but Tim Burton with ""Sweeny Todd"" elevates it to the purest form of art. He will be punished for that, as Ed Wood was in its day. Disappointing grosses in a world that worship grosses will make it appear as a sort of a failure. My advise to you is run to see it wherever you can find it. Try to see it in a big screen with great sound. You will fly and dream and be taken away by the masterful hands of Tim Burton and the glorious faces of Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter.",2008
10,"Tim Burton has gone beyond himself and anything he has ever done. ""Sweeney Todd"" is stunningly beautiful. Dark? yes, bloody? sure! but then we're in Victorian London where everything is what it appears to be no matter how turgid. The meeting of Mr Todd and Mrs Lovett is so scrumptiously conceived that I'm sure will be one of those film moments that are used whenever ""great film moments"" are compiled. Johnny Depp will never cease to amaze me. He is not just the beautiful boy with soulful eyes, but a great actor. How extraordinary that two talents like Burton and Depp should meet at the perfect moment in time. How lucky for us! Mrs Lovett is played by another extraordinary actor: Helena Bonham Carter. She is spectacular! Sacha Baron Cohen, Alan Rickman and in particular Timothy Spall add to the perfection of this film. Dante Ferreti, the production designer and Coleen Attwood, the costume designer, deserve all the kudos they are getting and will get. Glorious!",2008
10,"What an extraordinary treat this bloody dirty tale of vengeance and gore is. The exquisite way Tim Burton presents it to us makes it so. Stephen Sondheim's stage masterpiece becomes a film masterpiece of unequaled stature. Everything about it reeks of genius of magic. Once again, Johnny Depp fills, Burton's macabre universe with overwhelming humanity. He can slash as many throats as he wants if we look into Johnny's eyes we see the struggle, the human winning in despair. I know I'm not making too much sense but I just want to urge you, if you love cinema, to rush and see it as God intended, on a big screen and Dolby surround sound.",2008
10,"Yes, this is about a barber who kills people. Yes, this is a musical.",2007
10,"Contrary to the many comments I have read and heard about the film thus far, I thought it was absolutely wonderful. After what some could term a ""dry spell"" for Tim Burton, it is such a breath of fresh air to see this new offering, Sweeney Todd. The movie showed Tim returning to his roots of the dark, the sinister, and the macabre. All were blended together in the setting he is so very well-known for, the dark streets of London.",2007
8,"As a fan of the original stage version of this grimly Gothic tale, going into Sweeney Todd was bittersweet in my hopes and expectations. However, I'm pleased to announce that I did find Burton's latest effort impressive and intentional. Fans of the original won't be disappointed with a top-notch cast and the wonderfully dark overtures that haunt every minute of Sweeney Todd. Tim Burton, one of the masters of ambiance, sets his atmosphere in the grisly streets of a depressed London and his artistry punctures through every scene of screen time. I would have to clarify that, while Johnny Depp is a skilled actor, fans of the original will find it hard to believe that Depp has the ability to transform into the George Hearn ""Sweeny"" we've come to know. This is in fact true and recognized by Burton. In this respect, the character of Depp is not played as the same manner as the deep-voiced, towering Todd from the musical adaptation. Depp's is more of a less boisterous and thoughtful one. The vocal performances are great but have a different approach and feel to them. It was a refreshing adaptation and I feel a triumph on the part of Burton for making a stage-to-screen experience that captures you from it's bloody introduction.",2007
9,"Despite the grim expectations from the story synopsis, the film delivers gore in a surprisingly tasteful way. There are no screaming teenagers running from a lunatic; instead we get a somewhat British blend of satire, slapstick and just ""wrong"" humor. Although I'm not much of a Johnny Depp fan, I enjoyed his performance as well as Helena Bonham Carter's. Even the portrayal of the common clients was stunning.",2007
9,"I approached Sweeney Todd with trepidation, having been underwhelmed with most of Tim Burton's recent output and every screen musical of the last decade. The biggest problem I have with Burton's films is that his screenplays rarely manage to pull their disparate elements into a satisfying whole. Here, despite adapting the material to his own sensibilities and shortening the play by an hour, he adheres closely to Sondheim's book, resulting in the most dramatically satisfying film Burton has ever made. ",2007
10,"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is one of the year's most talked about films, it's getting big Oscar buzz and of course, what could be better than Tim Burton taking on this dark musical? With Johnny Depp starring along with beautiful Helena Bonham Carter by his side, this movie just screams terrific. My mom and I saw the movie today and Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street lived beyond to my expectations. Tim Burton hasn't exactly released a classic lately that would be remembered for all time, but Sweeny Todd is sure to make it's way into one of the most memorable films of 2007. Johnny Depp and Helena both have incredible voices, they were so hauntingly beautiful and magical together, it's like these roles were made for them. Along with an equally strong cast as Alan Rickman and Sacha Baron Cohen who were also incredible, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is a new memorable musical for years to come.",2007
9,Good dark fun.,2007
10,"And this conventicle has brought us a glistening and irresistible nightmare. There are delicious Dickensian overtones throughout, and the look of the film itself is poetically potent. The entire mix is shockingly seductive with an unforgettable ending. Burton's humor is part and parcel of his sheer brilliance, as always, and, as always, the great Johnny Depp is intense and positively unforgettable. All performances are electric, the pace and length are perfect, and the film draws us deeper and deeper with every moment into its stunning blend of the grotesque and the undeniably beautiful. Analysing the power of a film like this is no simple matter. The whole is dazzlingly disturbing. You don't want to miss a second of it, even though the film is merciless to us and to its protagonists. It sings, it glows, it enchants, it horrifies. I want to see it again. And again. It's a brutal and shattering masterpiece.",2007
9,"I am generally not a fan of musicals. I don't like the artifice of singing dialogue moments. I have no problem with singing in a movie but this grates on me. Take Dreamgirls for instance. For the most part i was fine with it, good songs, performed as performances with a narrative structure surrounding them. However once of twice it had songs in place of dialogue where characters were discussing things amongst themselves or some such thing and i just got annoyed. And yes i dislike all the classics like West Side Story for this very reason.",2007
10,"I came to ""Sweeney Todd"" with a clean slate, as it were. I'd never seen any of the previous stage or screen versions, and I'm generally adverse to the archly ironic style of Broadway composer Stephen Sondheim.",2007
10,"This movie stunned me so much that I could hardly move from my seat when it was over. The dark cinematography is brilliant and works so well to enhance the story. Johnny Depp has given us so many amazing performances in the past and you can put this one up there at the top of the list. I have to admit that in the past I have loathed Tim Burton offerings but he redeems himself in my opinion with a feast for the eyes and ears that is a triumph. I approached the movie with trepidation because actors put in singing roles seldom work, but not this time. The singing was not only terrific, it was mesmerizing. I have to warn you this movie is for movie fans that love music (Broadway, classical or opera) and have a cast iron stomach. I heard they used 70 gallons of fake blood filming it and I believe them. All I can say is you can see the bloody scenes coming a mile off so you have plenty of time to avert your eyes.",2007

9,"Tim Burton's adaptation of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's stage musical is less transposition than re-imagining; fraught with both heavy expectations and risky subject matter (murder, revenge, cannibalism, poverty---we're not talking ""Mamma Mia"" here), this cinematic offering had every reason to turn out a failure, or at least a massive letdown. Does the film fulfill the dark promise of its theatrical parent? Gloriously, the answer's yes.",2007
9,"It was bloody, disturbing, gruesome...and I loved every minuet of it! Deep makes a awesome Sweeney but I think Helena Bonham Carter is my favorite performance in this film, she is VERY funny and makes the character her own! BUT for people who love the stage version (which I do!) try to erase every thought of it from your mind! If you keep comparing it to what it was on stage than you won't enjoy it as much! Go in to the theater with an open mind and embrace the film for what it is (very different then what it is on stage)! This is an amazing film and I recommend it to every one (except to people who have week stomachs)!",2007
5,"Bearing in mind what Tim Burton films are like, I was still disappointed with the end result of the film adaptation of SWEENEY TODD. Most of the problems lie in the fact that Burton makes an already dark and gory tale even darker and gorier. This is precedence over plot and character detail, even cutting songs from the original show that greatly helped these areas.",2007
3,"Stephen Sondheim's musical ""Sweeney Todd"" explores moral dualism -- the belief of the coexistence or conflict between the ""benevolent"" and the ""malignant"", such as a conflict between good and evil. Sondheim expresses this in many ways, chief among them is his extensive use of counterpoint. Counterpoint is ""the relationship between two or more voices that are independent in contour and rhythm, and interdependent in harmony"". The term comes from the Latin 'punctus contra punctum' or ""note against note"". Counterpoint is often used in musicals, especially in songs that try to compare or contrast two or more characters' views. As written and originally conceived and staged, the musical counterpoint in ""Sweeney Todd"" mirrors not only the difference of views between the characters, but the conflict of views within each character.",2008

Having never been a big western fan (with a few exceptions - Shane, High Noon, The Wild Bunch) and having been rather indifferent to Walking The Line, James Mangold's last directorial effort, my expectations were modest, despite the hype that the film has received. But I was duly impressed. The action and tension remain constant throughout but, more importantly, the plot is compelling and the acting is terrific. No doubt many will be impressed by Ben Foster's affected performance as Russell Crowe's loyal but psychopathic sidekick (think Johnny Depp in the Pirate movies) but to my taste it was much too over the top in a cast that offered a number of subtle and well thought out performances.",2007

10,"It's one of the best westerns and best all-around movies I've seen in a long time. That's largely due to the outstanding performances by the cast, ably led by the alpha male, bad guy, Russell Crowe. His protagonist is Christian Bale who turns in a nuanced performance as the down-on-his luck rancher. The scenes between these two men are riveting and a display of acting at its best. The supporting cast are all wonderful and in particular, Ben Foster, Fonda and Logan Lerman as Bale's oldest son.",2007
9,"Being a fan of westerns from a young age, I really wanted to like this movie and I did. I just didn't love it because of a few too many plot holes and inconsistencies. If you are willing to suspend belief and enjoy the ride, it is a very satisfying movie filled with action, suspense and terrific acting showcasing the intricacies of complicated men. ",2007
9,"There's a scene near the end where Christian Bale is clearing the air, so to speak, between himself and Russel Crowe's character, that suddenly made clear to me what the entire film was about. It also dawned on me that Bale is a bit like this generation's Gregory Peck, only better. He seems able to explore other ways of being on screen without losing sight of reality. That's quite a trick, and key in this film, as it's really all about his character, Dan Evans, a struggling ex-soldier with a family and a marginal farm to take care of.",2007

1,"I sure got suckered into wasting time and money to see this turkey. If you like the Arnold Schwarzenegger genre of movies you would like this one. Russell Crowe plays Arnold. It's full of violence, cruelty, lies, treachery, profanity, sex and, worst of all, improbability. The good guys can't even deter the bad guys with a Gatling gun but one lone Mexican sharpshooter shooting from ""miles"" away, fells the good guys. When the bad guys see the good guys with a Gatling Gun they just laugh because they know the good guys can't hit the broadside of a barn with anything. The good guys can't even hit a horse with their Gatling Gun! And Ben Wade, the toughest, smartest, most ruthless outlaw of all times, remains in town, in a hotel room with a girl, with his horse tied up outside the bar until the Sheriff and his men ride back into town and easily take him into custody. (He has to be taken into custody early on in the movie in order to start this parody of getting him on the 3:10 to Yuma!) In one scene, toward the end, the gang offers the townspeople a $200 per person bounty on the Sheriff and each of the good guys and the townspeople go crazy in their desire to make $200 or more. And, in the end, Ben Wade, who, himself, or through his gang, has dispatched everybody who matters to their eternal rewards, is so impressed with the truth and courage of the opposition, that he voluntarily gets on the train to go back to the Yuma Prison for his third time and, most likely, to a date with the hangman. And then along the way there's some mention of the Bible, some Bible verses, and then some sort of cross or crucifix on Ben's gun handle. Yep, it's SOME movie. Recommend it to your friends who may have steered you to a similarly stupid flick or some friends that you would like to hear less from.",2007

1,"I have to think that I am so out of step with the masses. What can others be seeing that I missed. I will say that in the restroom after the movie the other women were laughing at the movie and shaking their heads in disbelief of the hype. There will be many spoilers below. First of all, the acting was fine...that's about all the good I could see. The screen play was illogical. Why would Russell Crow's character continually miss opportunities to escape and the good guys continually miss opportunities to kill the bad guys? Why would they sit around a roaring fire in Apache territory and why wouldn't the Apaches just kill them as they most certainly would have? Why would Russell Crow's character kill all his guys who risked life and limb for him? Why would the writer put a stupid schtick in a chase scene where one character throws an explosive and another character shoots the explosive in mid air while riding full out on a horse? Why would the mine team just stand there and wait to be shot by men they knew to be psycho killers? Why would Russell Crow risk his life jumping over roofs just trying to get to the train? Why would the good guys miss the opportunity to shoot the bad guys in the street with a perfect shot from the bridal suite? How did Peter Fonda recover completely in a 24 hour period after being gut shot? How did Russell Crow's mouth heal completely after being beaten unmercifully by Peter Fonda? Why was Russell Crow's hands handcuffed in front and not in the back? I could go on and on, but I've already wasted enough time and money on this complete mess of a movie.",2007

Crowe exudes cool throughout the movie as a heartless, smooth talking, Bible quoting killer. Of course...Ben Foster. Yes. Ben Foster. Welcome him to the bigtime, cause he made this movie. There hasn't been a western with a character so badass as the one Ben Foster plays in this movie. Story-wise, the movie is an opposite Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, with the good guys trying to run away from the bad guys in order to make a 3:10 train to Yuma.

1,"There is no reason for this entire movie. Other than the acting, which was good, this movie is a total waste. The story has too many flaws and holes in it. 3:10 to Yuma is every bit as uninteresting as The Assassination of Jesse James. It's overwrought, loaded down with the same thing over and over -- long periods of tough talk, followed by shooting their way out of an impossible situation. Then more chatter followed by another implausible escape from death. It has all the cartoonishness of an Indiana Jones movie.

He owned the screen in every scene he had. I think this is the beginning of a long and illustrious leading man career for him. The movie was well paced with great music and a hint of humor here and there. I loved this thing from start to finish. It was a taught and thoroughly entertaining film.

2,3:10 to Yuma is not an enjoyable film. Script writer didn't do his job properly. The movie wants us to leave our brain outside and just watch Russel Crowe without asking any question. To many improbable scenes. The plot is fine. A criminal is escorted to justice. But the way this is done is just something that that not happen in real life. The film is unrealistic. It should not have been made. It gives bad name to westerns. The only good thing about 3:10 to Yuma is the deputy leader of the bad guys. He steals the show. He is actually the man of the match. The film is too long and boring. Photography is bad. Last one hour is simply rubbish. You wont remember it 3 days later.,2010

A WARNING: Know what to expect when you go see this movie, or you might be surprised/disappointed. There is no moral, no good sense or life lesson to be taken from the story lines or characters. Sometimes things don't make sense and this is all done on purpose in homage to original exploitation films Warnings aside, Grindhouse is a lot of fun, there were as many ""ooh"" and ""ahh"" moments as there were ""oh my god why did they show that?"" moments. All of the actors' performances were right on and the action directing was excellent. My only negative comment is that Tarintino's film dragged a bit in the middle, but he more than made up for it.

3,"Films like Pulp Fiction are one of a kind, literally. No one can duplicate the success of Pulp Fiction. Many have tried, none have succeeded. The problem with this is that Quentin Taratnino made such an auspiciously brilliant debut with Reservoir Dogs and then Pulp Fiction, that he would have a very difficult time matching the brilliance of those two films. But who would have thought he would drop so far down on the directing evolutionary chain? Jackie Brown was just okay, but Kill Bill and now his Death Proof segment of Grindhouse is so embarrassingly bad that I think Tarantino has officially lost what made him such an ingénue. This is a sad statement as no one, with the exception of maybe Spielberg, exploded onto the scene the way Taratino did. But I'm not sure if anyone has burned out the way he has either. His films are gimmicks now. They are not really true movies, but rather they rely on cheap ideas that try to show us what a genius Tarantino is. He perpetually tries to show us how much of a film geek he is and while making films that only he could love, he forgets that most of us don't give a you-know-what about how much he knows about film. All we want is a movie that we can embrace. A movie that has a story, not just a bunch of uninteresting characters sitting around calling each other bitches and then spouting off more inside Hollywood stuff that Tarantino must of had a ball with writing and then chuckling to himself as he writes things in his scripts that only he would understand. This isn't a film for Quentin, it should be made for all of us. And it's not. And this is where he has failed. I know many many people adored Kill Bill. I'm not one of the loonies that did. It was more of an ego fest from Quentin. A subliminal flipping of the bird to all of us. Quentin makes movies for himself, not for us. And if this continues, he won't be working for much longer. He got away with it in Kill Bill because the movie was split in two. If it was one film, people would have walked out of it also.",2007

I have just returned from the advanced showing of the picture and will have to say I am completely satisfied with this great film, or should I say films. The audience was cracking up and cheering and it made the entire experience more memorable. This is the kind of film where I will always remember the first time I saw it. Rodriguez seems to have the most fun with his film Planet Terror. The film is Rodriguez's dream project that he has wanted to make since he was a teenager. Quintin seems to take his a little more serious, but delivers an original story with one of the most satisfying endings. 10/10 is the rating I give this film. I recommend this movies to anyone who is a lover of films.",2007

Even keeping in mind that this is supposed to be a throw back to the old grindhouse movies of years gone by, I was only interested for 15 seconds or so when Kurt goes head on with the first car of girls. Otherwise, the dialogue, and in turn the movie, was painfully boring, drawn out, and all in all, overwhelmingly pointless. Ever had the urge to tear your arm off because you were forced to sit in a small room(or car) and listen to 4 drunk and whiny girls bitch for about 90 minutes? If you've seen Death Proof, then you have. Only difference is that you probably don't get the chance to kill those broads when you've had more than enough.",2007
1,"Absolutely surprised to see this movie among top 250. The movie just doesn't have anything, no proper story, no good acting, not a single moment worth remembering. The print has been kept bad purposefully but sometimes it is sooo bad, you are forced to turn your face away from the screen. None of the characters are built up in any way, no attempt to do it anyway. The comment on the two segments follows. Planet Terror: Sometimes you feel its a spoof on quite a few action/horror movies but their is no humor, not a single moment, to justify that feeling. The action sequences are poorly shot and the non-stop idiotic action is irritating after a point of time. Crappy makeup. A very very bad attempt at making a gore/horror/action movie. Death Proof: Long wait for any action to begin and thankfully the print is a lot better that Planet terror so at least one can look at the screen for a longer time. No story, no characters, one average car chase sequence. At one point of time you wonder, how could Tarantino do something as bad as this. Overall, a completely avoidable movie.",2007
4,"OK. I love Rodriguez, and I had a fairly solid appreciation for Tarantino before I saw this piece of sh*t.",2007
10,"I absolutely love Tarantino and Rodriguez so needless to say this might be a bit bias but here it is: this film was amazing! I loved it from top to bottom. The characters were perfect and the plots were extremely interesting and visually impressive. This movie fully encompassed the true spirit of the Grindhouse genre and if these types of movies are your thing you will not be disappointed. Not to mention the trailers. They were hilarious and ridiculous all at the same time. Although the movie was a long one, you will have no problem sitting through over three hours of nonstop gore, violence some of the best car chase scenes I have ever seen and an all-star cast (including a few surprises I won't ruin for you) that just adds to the fun. GO SEE THIS MOVIE IMMEDIATELY!!!!!!!!",2007
7,"I've been looking forward to seeing Grindhouse since I first heard about it. From Dusk Til Dawn is my all time favorite movie, and that was the earliest and still best collaboration between directors Tarantino and Rodriguez. I was expecting something mind blowing, something so original that it would knock me flat on my ass, but overall, Grindhouse didn't do that for me.",2007
3,"Where to begin? The first movie had a couple funny moments, but other than that it was just awful. After reading a couple reviews on how this is one of the best films in years I just had to see it. What a mistake. The first film that was a ""horror"" film had these disgusting looking characters that was almost unwatchable. What did people see in this movie? The second film was even worse. Not only was it pointless, but it had two sections of the film where all the characters would do is ramble, and ramble and ramble on. Incredibly boring. The action scenes in this movie was nice though. The car chase scene was very action packed and was the best part of the film. Warning-- don't waste your time on this ""movie.""",2007
1,"People nowadays just like nonsensical violence, it really does not make sense for our society to produce this utter trash. Especially by directors that have such a big following, it just leads to many poisoned minds that have a much harder tolerance to violence and as of such are capable of much more violence than someone less exposed to imagery of this sort. ",2009
4,"'Grindhouse' is the first Tarantino or Rodriguez movie that I've seen that has left me feeling rather flat. Sure it's niftily directed and very funny in parts, but on the whole I think that Tarantino especially has to really ditch these vanity projects of his now. 'Kill Bill' was his homage to Kung Fu cinema, but it worked because it was so much better than the source material. The same cannot be said for both 'Planet Terror' & 'Death Proof', which are in turn average zombie and car chase movies. There is a lot of good stuff to be seen and fun to be had, but for the first time Tarantino's dialogue felt desperately laboured in 'Death Proof'. I just didn't buy any of those conversations the women were having - they just sounded like dirty mouthed men in women's bodies & I half expected the male cast of 'Reservoir Dogs' to walk in and start explaining what 'Like a Virgin' meant.

After Jimmy's stalker finds a loophole in the rulebook (yes, you read that right), the pair join forces to reclaim their rightful position at the top of the skating rankings.",2007
8,"I saw the preview several days ago and figured it was just another case of, ""put the funniest parts of the movie in the trailer to hook the public and then be disappointed later"", but I was surprised and the comedic cohesion between John H. and Will F.. The dialouge was some of the funniest I've heard in awhile and the physical comedy was timed perfectly. This is not just another mediocre performance from Heder and Will that we have grown accustomed to. This movie really delivers and there were plenty of great cameos. Including Jenna Fisher from the office and even Nancy Carrigan. If you truly have an eye for good comedy, they you'll love this movie. I think it was the best comedy I have seen in awhile.",2007
9,"I saw the press screening of Blades of Glory last night, and I have to say...I haven't laughed so much at a movie for quite some time. Jon Heder shines in his role and portrays a character that seems carefully written to avoid any similarities with Napoleon Dynamite; I was actually surprised that there weren't any references to ND (that I noticed), since there were a few Ferrell lines that reminded me of Anchorman (which was just fine!). Ferrell and Heder work wonderfully together; the ice skating scenes are pulled off very well; and, of course, there are tons of quotable lines. Overall, a funny, satisfying movie (especially if you're into ice skating or Anchorman/Talledega Nights-type humor).",2007
8,"When I first saw the trailer for this film I didn't think much of it. It looked as if it were just trying to cash in on the popularity of Will Ferrel after the success of Talladega Nights. Well, I was wrong, big time wrong. First off, almost every scene in this film is hilarious and the trailer does it no justice. Don't get me wrong, I love Will Ferrel films for the most part but this one looked like it would be an exception. Instead this film fits perfectly with my taste in comedies like Talladega Nights, Zoolander, Anchorman, Water Boy, Old School and Billy Madison. If you like these kinds of films you will love this film.",2007
8,"From the very first second I laid eyes on the absolutely hilarious poster for this film, in my neighborhood multiplex a few months ago, I knew with extreme certainty that I'd be seeing it the very first week it opened. Caught it on Wednesday and I'm here to say the movie most definitely delivers on the promise of the poster, big time.",2007
8,"What can I say? The whole theater laughed during this whole movie. There were a few cheap laughs and some very obvious jokes thrown in, but the delivery was par for the course as far as Farrell is concerned. In other words, if Farrell is your kind of comedic character, you'll love this movie. If, say, Hugh Grant is your idea of a comic character, you'll probably hate this movie. Will Farrell's character was essentially Ron Burgundy on ice skates, which is a great idea. Ron Burgundy was, of course, the embodiment of the so-called ""alpha-masculine"" persona of the '70s and '80s. - unabashedly proud, sexist, and narcissistic. Put him into a sport that in many peoples' eyes in inherently effeminate and you've got a sure-fire crowd pleaser.",2007
10,"I saw this movie last night and I have to say that I was impressed. I went with a friend to see this and I didn't think it would be that funny. The trailers were hilarious, but I thought they had used up all the funny jokes in the trailer and left nothing for the movie, boy was I wrong. If I went more than 5 minutes without laughing, there were very few times I did. ",2007
7,"I wasn't expecting much from this movie for two reasons: a) Heder hasn't done anything funny since Napoleon Dynamite and b) I thought Will Ferrel's shtick would start to run thin. Both actors played the type of character I expected from them. Heder gave something similar to the Napoleon Dynamite character and Will Ferrell was Will Ferrell. What I didn't expect was the humor. Ferrel carried the show and played the funniest character by far, but Heder didn't drag him down like I thought he would and the two worked well together. Heder was Jack Lemmon to Ferrell's Walter Matthau.",2007
7,"Will Ferrell and John Heder (Napoleon Dynamite) as figure skating partners. Sounds like a bad SNL skit? Right? I wasn't expecting much from this comedy whose trailers looked dull and uninspired. It seemed sure to bore. So when I sat down in the theater, I went in prepared to hate this movie. But then the credits began to roll, I was pleasantly surprised by the roll of names: William Fichtner, Craig T. Nelson, Amy Poehler, Will Arnett (Gob on Arrested Development), Rob Corddry, Jenna Fischer (The Office), and Romany Malco (The 40 Year Old Virgin). So I knew that even if the movie stunk, it would be fun to see the actors together on the screen. Also surprising was to see that Busy Philipps (Freaks and Geeks) had a role in creating the story.",2007
9,"This movie is a must see. If you enjoy Ferrell you will love this film. It is just a feel good laugh out loud comedy. There is not a bad performance in the movie. I didn't care for the Hector (Nick Swardson) story line. It was mildly funny in a sort of creepy/annoying way. That is the only blemish on this hilarious movie though. Ferrell and Heder play very well off each other. I am glad to see Heder play something a little different then Dynamite. Yes he sounds very similar but thats his voice. Poehler and Arnett make a great pair that you love to hate. Its great to see Craig T. Nelson doing what he does best, playing a coach. The end of this film rides the line of being either so stupid or comic genius, For my money its GENIUS!! ",2007
4,"Overall i would have to say the movie is nothing too special but is a very funny film i would like to see again. If you're looking for something to relax and enjoy a entertaining hour and a half with a friend, this is a good movie to go to. Will Ferrel is funny as in other films and fans of his will like it. John heder's character in some ways resembles napoleon dynamite with different flavor but it works. only concern would be for any young children because of the prevailance of sexuality. If you're offended by homosexuality there will be certain parts you will loath. But most people shouldn't be offended and will find this movie very entertaining.",2007
1,"Two skaters, Two bad actors, and 1 terrible script = Blades Of Glory. I have thought a LOT of times when I see a terrible movie, that it is definitely the worst movie ever made...well, after watching this, I now have a new #1. Will Ferrell's character does something out of the ordinary in this film, he likes to get drunk...wow who would have thought? Chazz Michael Michaels???, wow I'm thinking Will Ferrell came up with that all by himself. Everything he said was pure idiocy and far from funny, same goes for Heder. John, listen man, YOU ARE NOT FUNNY! ",2007
7,"Will Ferrel has fast become one of the most popular comedy actors in modern cinema. A few years back he was the man who did the great little cameos, the man who popped along on the rare occasion to deliver the most memorable sequence in the movie before running off with his pay check. Then something happened, suddenly he became popular. Anchorman displayed him as a force to be reckoned with, slowly but surely Ferrel became a lot more well known. And then something truly horrific happened, that truly horrific thing is simply called Bewitched. Despite being the best thing in a bad movie his career hit a stumble somewhat, he wasn't sure what comedies he should be in. He got a bit more on firm ground with Talladega Nights, but that didn't propel him to the extreme greatness I found him before Bewitched was made. With him also messing round with more serious roles in Stranger than Fiction I wondered if he could hit his stride once more. Well Blades of Glory sees him sprinting once more, its a shame then that no one else in the movie can keep up with him. You see while Blades of Glory is a very funny movie full of very funny ideas, its also a movie thats seriously lacking until the ending. The major problems are that the supporting cast are just way too forgettable. The main villains, while having amusing moments, aren't memorable, the coach is certainly no Patches O'Houlihan from Dodgeball, and the creepy stalker is so wasted an opportunity its almost pitiful. Jon Heder finally delivers a performance that is at least passable since Napoleon Dynamite, and as I've said Will Ferrel is simply brilliant.",2007

I'd rather watch all the really funny, creative stuff that regular people are putting up on youtube. Maybe some day, if regular people ever wake up and realize how much they are collectively paying for the soul-numbing, pablum Hollywood churns out, they'll figure out how badly they are being ripped off. Reading all these glowing reviews about a crappy movie like this is like listening to someone raving about a gourmet dining experience at McDonalds. Make your own entertainment. Boycott Hollywood! Don't buy into the advertising and psychological manipulation that you need to be entertained by ""experts"". Free your mind.",2007
1,"What a load of rubbish... this is up there with one of the worst films ever made (and without a doubt one of the worst ""comedies"" ever made). I just couldn't understand when we were meant to laugh... it was so cringeworthing bad it was getting embarrassing watching it. The worst thing as well is the fact that Will Farrell is a good actor and can be up with Stiller in the comedy film stakes and he's been given this kind of poor material. The acting throughout is good enoough... but the script and story just isn't enough to hold any interest. It's trying to be Kingpin (10/10) on Ice and fails miserably... It really astounds me and worries me that some 20% of people are giving this 10/10 for what is an appalling comedy... how can this compare to something like Dodgeball/Kingpin/Naked Gun etc etc? Sorry but can't find anything to give it higher than a 1/10 and the problem is, this is now about 3 turkey's Farrell has made now??? Where's he go from here as I certainly won't be bothering watching anymore of his ""comedies"".",2007
1,"This movie was so boring. I have lost all faith in Will Ferril being a good comedic actor. My friend was psyched to see this movie because various sources gave it great reviews. I was hesitant to go along because I know this would end up another stupid comedy with dumb sexual references and Will Ferril being a childish drunk-off-his-butt character. And do you know what? I was right. It's has bad actors, Will Ferril being drunk, Jon Heder, and Ice Skating. To me, that is a recipe for disaster. I chuckled 4 times during this movie and didn't laugh at all, except once at my own joke as to how bad the movie was. I told my friend I was going to go to the bathroom, when instead I just sat outside the theater for 10 minutes playing on my cell phone. The story line is stupid in this movie, and it is such a terrible movie. I don't know how the people in the theater were laughing like crazy at all the stupid antics of Will Ferril. Bottom line: Don't SEE THIS MOVIE!",2007
1,"Did I remember to laugh during this stupidly inane piece of trash? I don't think so! Nothing, absolutely NOTHING was funny. It was so inanely stupid that it was downright insulting. Here's the basic premise of the film: how many ways can you make homophobic jokes? Let's have them grimace at touching hands. Let's invert them so they have each other's crotches in their faces. And make sure that at every possibility, Will Farrell indicates his displeasure and disgust at homoerotic overtones with the same weary expression. It's almost as if the actor himself was saying: ""Here we go again. I have to register displeasure."" Lame! A terribly poor excuse for a movie.",2007

After the men go their separate ways for awhile, Jimmy learns of a loophole in the rules which would allow them to return to skating but only if they compete in the doubles category. Even though the two men hate each other with the heat of a thousand white-hot suns and they would be the first all-male duo in the history of competitive skating, Chazz and Jimmy agree to bury the hatchet and take a stab at mounting a comeback. The fact that the two of them are complete opposites in terms of demeanor and style - Jimmy is a cupie-faced innocent while Chazz is a swaggering macho man, both on the ice and off - only adds to the absurdity.",2007

8,"As night begins to fall for a thirty day spell over a small Alaskan outpost village, a motley crew of vampires comes waltzing in for a feast in David Slade's adaptation of the graphic novel, ""30 Days of Night."" Ever since ""Interview with the Vampire"" vampires have been depicted in films as something hip, cool, and sexy. Recently the idea of becoming a vampire is like making a fashion statement or becoming a Scientologist. In ""30 Days of Night"" the vampires are nameless, cunning, animal-like bloodsuckers and far from mindless zombies (which have been more popular of late). Finally, vampires are restored to film as monsters to be feared and not as some sympathetic and alluring subculture.",2007
9,"""30 Days of Night"" is easily one of the best horror movies I've seen in a very long time mostly because everyone involved seemed to know exactly what it takes to make a decent horror movie. It's not obscene amounts of gore or monsters jumping out at the camera that make a movie scary. It's creepy atmosphere that makes a movie particularly scary, and this movie does a great job at creating the kind of atmosphere that fills the viewer with the kind of dread that so many movies fail to achieve. It's not perfect, but it's still better than just about every horror movie I've seen since ""The Descent"" (which also relied on a creepy atmosphere to fill the viewer with a sense of dread and hopelessness).",2007

8,"I am typically not a great fan of vampire films. However,this movie is a new take on an old legend. The setting is fantastic and what could be more scary than 30 days of endless night when you are besieged by vampires. These are not your fathers vampires,nothing seductive or even campy about these guys. They are what the vampire was originally supposed to have been..SCARY! I think of all setting..an arctic or Alaskan frozen,isolated area is a great stage for horror and suspense. Movies like Howard Hawks ""The Thing from Another World"" and its 1982 sequel ""The Thing"" use the same setting with admirable results. Even the underrated Stephen King mini-series ""Storm of the Century"" uses the same cold,barren and isolated setting to create tension,despair and hopelessness. The acting is average,if not slightly above,and the mood and lighting are very good. All in all a movie that made you crave a little more when it ended..and that is what all movies strive for. Although it could have had a few improvements and should have provided a little more background for the story(things sort of just go to hell all at once),it is most definitely a film worth a couple hours of your time.",2007
9,"Sinister, brutal, and unrelentingly violent, 30 Days of Night is the best vampire movie  and likely best horror movie  to be unleashed upon audiences this year. As fear and dread gradually give way to full-blown terror as the ruthless vampires descend upon the isolated town, the audience is never given a moment to catch their breath. No one is safe and seldom does a sliver of hope surface in the rapidly diminishing chance of survival in this world submersed in darkness. Though the story grounds itself in preconceived vampire mythos, the visuals do not, and a masterpiece of bloody violence emerges, revealing such intensely vicious imagery that fans of the genre (as well as the original graphic novel) will revel in the carnage.",2007
10,"I absolutely loved 30 Days of Night! It was the best film I have seen in a while, and it scared me right down to my boots! But this film was also very thrilling, action-packed and suspense-filled, with a massive showdown between the Chief of Police and the Head Vampire in the final sequence of the movie. An emotional and tear-jerking ending, but the rest of the movie was packed jam with action, suspense, terror and ruthless violence! The best vampire film of the year! I am just so full of compliments for this film. Josh Hartnett was great as the Chief of Police, and as the leader of a small band of survivors, who have to survive 30 Days of Night whilst their village comes under attack from a bunch of ruthless, flesh-eating vampires. The vampires were extremely terrifying, I thought! The most gut-wrenching, terrifying moment in the film, is where you see a small girl of no more than six years of age (who has obviously been transformed into a vampire) munching away on a human body. When she raises her head, her mouth is covered in blood, and she is as pale as a sheet. Her scream is truly blood-curdling, and she is terrifying! I really, really enjoyed this film. I loved the way that they had to survive thirty days, and that some days they would succeed in saving lost survivors, but other days some of them would die. A truly gripping, edge-of-the-seat film! The best horror movie I've seen! As per usual with horror films, the violence is quite horrific and they don't hold back on the decapitations, so if you're not sure on that sort of thing, then I would advise you not to watch the film. Some moderate drug and sex references, but it's not too bad. The film mostly focuses on the vampires and the small band of survivors.",2008

Well done !! It is refreshing to see a vampire film that doesn't shy away from violence and that doesn't dwell on anything that can be even remotely construed as hokey. A new cinematic creature, 30 Days of Night's antagonists are ultra scary with their deformed appearances and their mercilessly gut-wrenching killing sprees. They speak in their own demonic language and have super human strength and speed, making them a Michael Myers fashioned juggernaut. High-pitched shrieks, blood-soaked visages and razor-sharp fingernails complete a frightening design of this force to be reckoned with.What impressed me very much, was the ending of the movie that was pure and simple stunning !! I really recommend this movie for the people who loves horror movies.",2007

This movie has different versions of this; a senile old man, someone not being quiet when they're told repeatedly to be quiet and someone running into the open after some one else. There are also people investigating strange noises, a person prophesising that everyone is doomed, and loud noises to make the audience jump by means of compensating for the poor story and plot development. There are also the gratuitous gore scenes.",2007

It has a lot of action, gore and suspense in it with some scary scenes that either made you jump or momentarily cover your eyes. The setting is really ingenious and is quite frightening if you were to place yourself in the shoes of the people in the town. Another great thing I loved about this movie was that it gave a new face to vampires. They are not undead creatures in capes that fly around romanticizing humans. They are blood thirsty creatures who look and act like animals. I definitely recommend this movie to all horror fans and even more so to vampire fans. This is one movie that I hope they make a sequel for.",2008
9,"First, here's a bit of backstory for you. As you know by now, Streebo is a long time reader of comic books and when the story of 30 Days of Night came out in 2003 (?) I was eager to read it. I was immediately impressed by the simplicity of the concept  if not the execution. Ben Templesmith's dark and atmospheric art helped keep the book horrific and violent throughout. The story by Steve Niles was unchallenging, simple and brilliant all at the same time. I remember reading the book and thinking this was a cool enough graphic novel  but it would make an amazing movie. Apparently Steve Niles originally wrote 30 Days of Night as a screenplay and shopped it around Hollywood for years. He never drew interest in the script  so he converted the script into a graphic novel. The comic comes out and is a huge hit. The next thing you know Hollywood comes knocking on Steve Niles' door. Niles dusted off his script and Sam Raimi's Ghosthouse pictures gave him a one million dollar check for it. Now fast forward four years later. . .",2007

I mean from the moment I saw the trailer early spring, I was looking up on IMDb when the release date was, it was agony knowing that I had to wait until October. Finally, last night, opening night, it was storming in my city, so it was like the most perfect time to go see this movie. So my friend and I saw this last night and the theater was packed, when the movie ended, there was only one person who started to clap, but then stopped immediately when he saw that there was no one else clapping. While my friend liked this movie, I wasn't too thrilled. It didn't seem like a real vampire film, more like Night of the Living Dead or 28 Days Later, where this group is just hiding from the vampires. Not to mention that things were just not well explained, but maybe I need to read the book to get it, because this movie failed to explain certain situations.",2007

BS that presents absolutely no sense of action or really idea of what's going on (and HOW can a vampire drink the blood if it's shaking its head back and forth like that?!), and the writing and directing is completely illogical. Somehow we're supposed to accept that these vampires are capable of preconception enough to plan to go to Alaska during winter in order to vacation in the 30 days of darkness, plus existential quotes about the absence of God and whatnot, and yet they don't even seem to have the simple intelligence to ration out the 150 citizens of Barrow over time or even TO SHUT UP WHILE HUNTING!

Sheriff Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett) and Deputy Billy Kitka (Manu Bennett) find many cell phones burned on the road. Then they receive a phone call from the local creator telling that his dogs have been slaughtered; later Eben finds the operator of the cell tower decapitated. He arrests a troublemaker drifter (Ben Foster) and the stranger frightens him telling that ""they are coming and the locals will be dead"". Sooner Eben discovers that the town is under siege and attacked by a gang of bloodthirsty vampires, and together with a few survivors, they hide in a empty cellar expecting for the next sunrise.",2008
1,"well i suppose from my summary you can tell that i was not impressed with this film. i feel once again like a stupid fool for getting all worked up for this movie after seeing the trailer and thinking about what an interesting concept this could be. what started out as something i might be able to get into turned into one of the biggest turgid messes of a train wreck that i have not witnessed in my 50 or so years of movie going. now mind you, i am one of the easiest guys to please. sometimes i go see a movie because i know that it is going to be a stinker and have a great time laughing at the horrible dialogue or completely out of kilter plot holes and so forth. as the film unspooled, i sat in amazement.......did he just say what i think he said? no. you mean to tell me that the director and screenwriters finished this half baked flawed project, went into the screening room and actually emerged with their heads held high and high- five-ing each other on a job well done? i know that making a film of any kind is not easy but come on! stale dialogue...stupid music cues for the horror discovery scenes and on and on. i want to know why the vampires, who at the beginning of the movie can run fast enough to catch a speeding car and can group together and lift one become more stupid and slower with each passing scene. at one point they are snatching bodies with lightning speed and at another the two leads are trapped in a car and the baddies just stand around and screech and make grabbing arm gestures that are easily fought off. huh? why did the vampires set out to kill everyone immediately and not pace themselves? it seemed like it was just killing for killings sake. no rhyme or reason. very very boring. Danny Huston was the best thing going for this film. i actually payed a little more attention when he was on screen. as for the ending, its the same old story. Hartnett goes mano e vampo with the lead vampire while all the others stand around and screech and do nothing to help kill Harnetts character. i actually felt no passage of time for the 30 days that passed and there was really no tension built up for any kind of climax what so ever. at the end of the movie when Josh Hartnetts character sits on the edge of the cliff and watches the sun come up with his lady love i would like to think that he is actually thinking of his career at this point turning to ashes just like his body. would somebody somewhere please please make a horror movie thats really fresh and even a little scary?",2007
4,"The title is completely irrelevant: Yes there the film covers 30 days but action only happens in about 3 of them. Almost everyone is killed in feeding frenzy on the first night, then its day 7 then day 14? then day 27 and presumably, finally 30 (They don't put text up for that but it's implied because the the sun is rising). There is no sense of time passing. On each day when something happens the action is kicked off by someone saying that they have to move on despite there being no obvious reason to do so other than to put themselves in danger and when they do move they always walk slowly down the middle of an unlit street that is brighter than mine is with a full moon and all the street lighting on! Having said all that, The characters are OK and it was kind of enjoyable in a Sunday afternoon TV kind of way.",2007
2,"The idea is good. I have to give them that. Vampires can only hunt at night so they choose to go to a place that goes a whole month without daylight, a small Alaskan town of a couple of hundred inhabitants. The film is nicely directed, the cast is decent. I don't like Josh Hartnett, but since i saw Slevin, i was more than wiling to see how he'd go about a horror movie. So really the base is there, but i just found the whole thing terribly boring and predictable. It indulges itself in violence, and everything in this film other than a whole month for vampires to go on a rampage (which is an adaption as far as i'm aware) has been done before. The vampires costumes look like those in Blade, there is a man eating child, like interview with the vampire, for some reason still speaking in English rather than the pathetic vampire dialect the others seem to prefer, and then turns to screaming just when you would expect her to. There is the obvious collaborator who, while in a prison cell tells the know-it-all police officer JH that everyone is going to die, but alas no one believes him, other than hero Josh's winy brother (who of course overcomes his fear of basically everything later on in the film) Now, while idea behind the storyline is really quite cool i think, the plot itself is shallow as. It's essentially Josh Hartnett kicking ass with the one or two mess-ups which have to be sorted out by one of his companions. And while the film is fairly quick and you won't be left waiting for blood for long once the story got going, the plot is dead slow. The film is about a month of sheer agony, fear and desperation for the people in that town, in which every day can be their last. The film gives you a time frame by showing the days that have passed since the vampires came to town and the sun disappeared. Now the gaps between these are ridiculous. At one point there is a 10 day gap between the last day shown and the one it's about now. Not even a vague idea is given where the vampires come from, (even from dusk till dawn tried that). Actually you cannot even say for sure if they actually are vampires. Of course they have the characteristics, drinking blood, afraid of light etc, but the word vampire is never mentioned once. So technically, if you have never heard of vampires before watching this, you would have no idea what's going on. Now while that is fairly unrealistic to assume about anyone, i reckon it is kind of important for a film to be able to stand for itself. The single most annoying thing though, which eventually ruined the whole film completely for me was the ending. It makes no sense. The 'day' before the sun comes up again, our hero Josh makes a last stand against the vampires in order to save his girl while the whole town is in flames, by injecting vampire blood(..), turning himself into a semi-vampire, who can smell human blood and is not attacked by other vampires, but doesn't have the urge to kill and drink blood. Now how he knows that doesn't become evident, it is simply fed to the audience, that this is the only chance they have (while i guess waiting for a couple of hours till the sun comes up would have done the trick itself). So Josh kills the uber vampire, while the others don't try to stop him and simply walks back to his pals sitting in the dark. He then looks at his last sunrise together with his girl, and turns to ashes. And that's it. Now how much can you criticise a film like this for not being logical, unrealistic or far fetched? My two favourite vampire films are From Dusk Till Dawn and Interview With a Vampire, obviously for completely different reasons. FDTD makes a perfect example of how to make a splatter comedy without taking itself seriously for a single moment. IWAV takes itself very seriously, but vampires are more of a medium to ask deeper questions, especially what it would be like to live forever. 30 Days of Night however tries to be a horror movie yet it cannot live up to anything that's been done before on a similar topic, given its shallow plot, its unbelievable main character and far too many question marks rising while watching it. The idea behind the story, as i've said before, is cool, but - unfortunately - the rest simply sucks.",2007
10,"I went in with low expectations, and this film really surprised me. It's probably one of the best vampire films I've seen in a very long time. I don't want to say too much for those who have yet to see it, but these vampires in the film were unlike any I've seen before. I've read some reviews where people were unimpressed with Josh Hartnett and I don't typically care for him but I thought he did a fine job in this film. I was looking for him to screw it up and I was really impressed with his performance, thought he did a great job. One of the things I love about this film is that it fails to explain a lot of things, I know some people dislike that but I feel that too many explanations usually lead to the downfall of certain films. This was perfect, and I can't wait for it to come to DVD.",2007
8,"I've noticed a lot of the negative comments about this title tend to focus on this movie's vulgar, 'stupid' humor. Now let's get one thing straight. Knocked Up is vulgar, absolutely it is, but is is not stupid. Stupid humor is crap like ""Mr. Woodcock"" and ""Good Luck Chuck,"" movies with no real craft to any of their jokes.",2007
1,"What would you do if you became pregnant by an oversexed bong-snorting gross pig of a human being after one drunken night of bar-hopping debauchery? Such is the question proposed in Judd Apatow's Knocked Up (2007) a mindlessly indoctrinating and strained, weak-premised regurgitation of that 'what if' and 'day after' scenario. The film is populated by thoughtless/clueless individuals who wouldn't be able to discover their own navels with two hands and a compass. This is a movie as primary and obvious in its effects as any clap-trap about twenty-somethings who should never become parents.",2008
9,"Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) meets Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) at a bar, they get drunk and have a little fun afterward, then they part ways. That is, until a few weeks later, Alison discovers she's pregnant and Ben is the father. This simple story makes up the hilarious film Knocked Up. I really enjoyed this, it has a lot of great laughs and it also has a lot of heart spread throughout.",2007
8,"From the title I expected an idiot-teen comedy, but it was quite a grown-up comedy.

She's pregnant. Now what happens? ",2007
6,"I went into the theater not knowing what to expect, not having seen the trailer, and two hours later I felt I had seen a decent movie, quite funny at times, but I couldn't figure out what everyone was making such a big deal about. Compared to a lot of what passes for comedy in the cinema these days, Knocked Up is great, but it's hardly the ""instant classic"" that I've seen it called in many professional and IMDb reviews. It's certainly worth seeing, but maybe at a discount matinée instead of a full-price evening show.",2007
1,An all around awful movie. The dialog was awful. The story was awful. The acting was awful. There was no redeeming factor. When tempted to watch this movie just remember you will never be able to get the hours wasted back.,2007
5,"My 17 year old daughter and I had been looking forward to the release of this movie for quite some time and we went on opening day. Both of us like Katherine Hiegl and we were looking forward to a witty, funny film. Instead, we both thought that there was a negative edge to all of the humor that relentlessly followed the cast of characters from scene to scene. The main male and his friends were all unkempt slackers and it was hard to find something to like about them. The drug use was annoying and excessive - are there adults out there who really behave like this? Every negative stereotype about pregnant women and women not accepting their aging gracefully had to be dragged into the plot. The one nice male seemed to love his spouse but was unable to communicate his interests or feelings toward her and seemed like such a wimp. Even the two studio executives were tired stereotypes that denigrate women. Did the characters really have to be so cynical and negative? With the exception of the two sisters, it didn't seem like any of the characters really liked each other or really wanted to be around the others. I think the excessive drug use and nasty attitude toward sex was annoying. It is interesting to see that both males and females under 45 are rating this film very closely and much higher than both males and females over 45. It's certainly not a movie that we will see again.",2007

5,"It's amazing to me how average low brow comedies like this show up in the top 250 ahead of real deserving movies such as ""The Odd Couple"", ""Plains, Trains, and Automobiles"", and ""The Naked Gun"", but I would guess thats because a lot of the teenage and college movie goers rate this one high . Anyway, I went to see this the other night and got a few laughs and a chuckle or two every once in a while. But it was hard for me to get past the notion that this beautiful, successful, career woman would want anything to do with a dopey, unemployed, bonghead who doesn't shave once in the entire movie. Just the fact that he tossed his condom away right before the moment and didn't tell her and she only gets a little upset and still wants to be with this guy? Ridiculous! Anyways if you want a few sophomoric laughs and decent acting, this is OK.",2007
1,"I can count on one hand the number of movies that I could not watch all the way through. This is one of them. The vulgarity of the main character and all of his buddies was so over the top as to be totally unbelievable; beyond even the realm of fantasy. I think I can tolerate a fair bit of this sort of stuff, but the movie exceeded my threshold. The only way the writers could have made this gang of misfits any less appealing would have been to make them criminals. I stopped watching soon after the lead female character decided to keep the baby; a decision that was totally unrealistic given her new career as a television interviewer. The idea that a woman like her would have anything to do with a guy like that was simply ludicrous. I thought this was going to be a good comedy, but excessive vulgarity isn't funny, it's just vulgar.",2007
8,"I liked Judd Apatow's first comedy,'The 40-Year Old Virgin'.When it comes to comedy,Judd knows exactly how to make people laugh until they beg him to make another movie.'Knocked Up'isn't just funny.It's a smart and refreshing movie that actually teaches a lesson:make sure you wear a condom when you have sex with a woman.But if you want a child,then do whatever that floats in your mind.The one thing that I probably dislike about the movie is it's running time.Even you probably wouldn't want to watch a really funny movie that lasts 129 minutes.But its definitely worth it when it comes to 'Knocked Up' and Judd Apatow.Grab some popcorn,get some friends,and laugh your butt off at this funny and brilliant comedy if you haven't already.",2009
8,"Greetings again from the darkness. ""Freaks and Geeks"" lives on through multiple tie-ins - not the least of which is writer/director and producer Judd Apatow (best known for his smash hit ""40 Year Old Virgin"").

9,"As I lived part of my life in the US, both coasts. I was able to read between the lines of the dubbed-into-Italian breakthrough Judd Apatow comedy and laugh. Most people dismissed it at the movie theater in Rome where I saw it. Thought it was vulgar and old hat. Vulgar? The Italians of the Massimo Boldi comedies thought it was vulgar?! ""Knocked Up"", besides making me laugh out loud and amusing me no end taught me a really important cultural lesson. We, in Italy, ride a very high (non existent) horse. I think the time has come for us to get off the horse and start looking at ourselves for what we really are - like we used to in Dino Risi, Pietro Germi and Mario Monicelli's films. ""Knocked Up"" is ultra sophisticated and yet, it reached a vast audience in the States because the sophistication is so amazingly smart. Seth Rogen is a real find. His eyes when he realizes Katherinre Heigl is going to stay with him that first and fatal night made me fall in love with his unlikely character. Katherine Heigl is another incredible discovery. Superb and stunning and classy to boot. Now, all this praise and I haven't even seen it in its original English version. I can't wait.",2007
1,CONTAINS SPOILERS THROUGHOUT,2007
8,"Probably because there is something fundamentally poignant about watching people you deem hopeless stumbling toward responsibility, this movie reminds me of the old Natalie Wood/Steve McQueen dramedy, 1963's ""Love With the Proper Stranger"", about a Macy's salesgirl who gets impregnated by a ne'er-do-well jazz musician during a one-night stand and then tracks what happens afterward. However, this is the 21st century, and the girl is now an interviewer on E!, and the guy is a very non-McQueen-like slacker in this uproarious and quite humane 2007 comedy, the latest work from writer/director Judd Apatow (""The 40-Year-Old Virgin""). In both comedies, he manages an amazing balancing act between a raunchy, post-frat hilarity and a shrewdly observed social commentary. Yet, there is no discernible fluctuation in the humor or the genuinely good spirit the films generate. Blessedly free of exhausting crescendo moments, the dialogue has a nice ramshackle feel and so do the characters. You really feel you want to know what happens to them after the film ends.",2007
2,"This movie was like deja-vomit all over again. If you think this is funny look in the mirror for your lobotomy scar. One reviewer said this was the funniest movie of the year. Did we see the same movie? See Hot Fuzz if you want to see a much funnier movie. When will Hollywood stop cranking out this stock crap? This movie starts with the standard ""we are cool"" single guy scene where a group of guys demonstrate how hip and now they are by doing jackass like stunts (hence the spoiler,just in case that was an important plot point for you). Then it goes into a standard set of impossible, only in the movies series of events. Ugly boring guy meets beautiful girl blah blah blah. Yuck.",2007
9,"I saw this recently and left with a stomach ache from laughing so hard. I watched 40 Year Old Virgin again to make a fair assessment, and i found this to be funnier. Don't get me wrong, I love all of Judd Apatow's work, but this to me was the best thing since Freaks & Geeks. Apatow has a brilliant way of letting the audience get to know all of the characters(anyone who has seen his stuff will know that it is a lot and usually the same people)which gives you the feeling that you are a part of what's going on, and makes you interested. By now, I am sure everyone is familiar with the plot summary. Couple meets, hooks up and surprise she's pregnant. I find it amusing that some of the previous comments mention that it it such an unbelievable concept. Well of course it is, it's a movie!!! But come on, is it not entirely true that someone would hook up on a celebratory night out with someone they normally wouldn't? Of course they would! Thus, the meeting of Alison( Ketherine Heigl) and Ben (Seth Rogen)seems so genuine and awkward. The aftermath is the best part though. Since this is a movie, trying to make the best out of a bad situation is a given. The getting to know someone AFTER they have gotten you pregnant, meeting family and friends, realizing the many differences you have, etc. All of this is explored is very realistic fashion, especially the emotion and the trying to have sex while six months along!! Of course the whole thing can't be comedy. With so many other characters to help take the focus off the main two, there will be parts of the story that are more ""serious"". True is the case towards the end with Alison's sister (Leslie Mann) and her husband (Paul Rudd) having a falling out. This is a very nice, but what seems eternally long, scene about the importance of understanding in a relationship. Could that be the moral of our story Alison and Ben, understanding and acceptance? I think so. Naturally the only thing left is birth and the happily ever after. The hospital scene is definitely NOT for the squeamish. I really hope those parts are not cut from the movie, because they received some of the most reactions. I found this whole seen to be painfully realistic, more so than any other movie has dared to be. Finally, the happy ending is upon us and the closing credits are filled with family snapshots and even childhood photos of cast and crew, very cute. So to you the potential viewer I say that this is an exceptional comedy. It is definitely the funniest thing I have seen this year. I will definitely be seeing it again to see all the parts I missed while laughing. And I must say I was absolutely delighted to see both Martin Starr (do NOT leave the theater during the scenes with his girlfriend) and Loudon Wainwright. Put one more in the win column for Judd Apatow.",2007
1,"I really don't understand why everyone carried on about this movie like it was the best one ever made. I seriously did not laugh once during the whole film, I don't understand how you can call this crap comedy, if you ask me it was more depressing than humorous. So it's obviously about a woman who got a really good job, who was knocked up by this loser, how predictable you know what is going to happen. It's all a happy ending as they decide to put their troubles aside and become a family, instead of taking the logical step and having an abortion. Whats in-between the beginning and end though is pathetic, no in fact it's probably more entertaining to watch a blank screen for 133 minutes. The actress that played Debbie was the most annoying character I have ever seen, all she ever does is complain and bitch the whole time. Please do not waste time/money to see this crap, if you really need to know the (obvious) plot, look up the film on Wikipedia, it will be a better use of your time. By the way, if you just want to see this film for nudity, there is a bit of nipple and that's it don't bother.",2008
1,"Basically, this was a sophomoric and very clichéd film with revolting toilet humor passing for comedy. And there really wasn't very much of this so-called ""comedy"" in the film. This was more of a dramatic movie. It might have been better played totally straight with much more originality. (I thought marijuana jokes kind of faded out with the 1970's). These ""adults"" acted more like children than children (as the song goes). And that also includes Katharine Heigl's character and the actress who played her bitch of a sister. Even when Seth Rogen supposedly becomes a ""mature"" man as the movie goes on, it's hard to really believe he will make a one hundred eighty degree turnaround in his ways. ",2007
10,"This was a very comical movie. I went into the viewing with mild expectations; after all, the previews were decent and Cal from 40-Year Old Virgin was to play a lead role. These expectations were far surpassed. The film did not loose steam at all as the plot progressed, and the audience was enthralled throughout in addition to being thoroughly entertained. The movie also had aspects that appealed to the more serious issue at hand. There were an abundance of one-liners and the film was very well written and produced. All in all, this is the best comedy after a comedic drought lasting from the summer of 2005 with the departure of Wedding Crashers and 40 Year Old Virgin from screens. This is a must see and a great relief to those that enjoy a good laugh and have been neglected for two years.",2007
1,"I am (won't say 'was' yet) a huge fan of Judd Apatow and to a lesser degree Seth Rogen who has worked with him for many years now. I thought ""Freaks & Geeks"" as well as ""Undeclared"" were both amazing and showcased kids who were 14 going on 40. Unfortunately for ""Knocked Up"" the characters are 40 going on 14. Are we supposed to care or even feel empathetic toward ANY of these characters? Looking at many of the other IMDb reviews, I think Rogen and Apatow hugely missed the mark here. Throughout the movie I kept HOPING that Rogen's character would have ONE decent quality. Then SUDDENLY he does an about face and gets a job -- sorry how does an illegal alien get such a fantastic job - much less any job with no work experience??

The male character has no character what so ever and the female in the film is sooo washed its not even funny. A dope fiend gets a girl pregnant and we are supposed to feel that the girl in the film is more special than the guy. I don't think so happens everyday. This movie is about Nothing!

6,"The first Die Hard was probably the best modern action film ever made. The second Die Hard works because the movie has a major sense of humor about how ridiculous it is to put John McClane through such a similar situation again; it practically makes fun of itself for a lot of the movie. The third one works because you have a bad guy that is out for revenge against John McClane. The fourth one though, it just felt like McClane's character was dropped in as an after thought. I don't think you can just drop John McClane into any story and call it Die Hard and this movie felt more like a Tom Clancy political thriller than a Die Hard movie.",2007

1,"die hard 4 is a PG rated kiddie movie with a bored, middle aged superhero sleepwalking through uninspired vignettes while tackling an internet hacker with all the charisma of pancake batter. Its plot was seemingly written by a grade schooler with a box of crayons. The CGI ""action"" sequences were uninspired and badly staged, to the point of almost being slapstick or satirical, the only scene that had even a modicum of excitement to it was the opening shootout in Long's apartment. The real Die Hard trilogy may have one or two scenes in each movie which pushed credibility, but they were well directed and photographed and had a musical score to add to the tension, and the earlier stories were so strong that we could overlook a couple of lapses in logic. This movie was so outlandish, and the plot was so badly written it was insulting. We're actually expected to believe that McClane can drive an 18 wheeler and outrun a fighter plane, jump out of the 18 wheeler as it rolls over and fall 20 feet onto the wing of a jet, then hang onto the wing of this spinning out of control fighter plane, jump off the jet and survive a 40 foot drop onto a concrete embankment and survive sliding on his back down another 30 feet or so.

The movie keeps up its pace throughout, and the script works quite well, though the tech-talk gets a little heavy at times. I was particularly worried about Wiseman directing, since both underworld movies were a complete mess in my opinion, but he really keeps it tight and disciplined this time around. Is Die Hard 4.0 the second or third best of the series? I don't know, but it is certainly a worthy successor, and all the other blockbusters should look this way to see how its done efficiently, crisp and above all entertaining.",2007
3,"The original ""Die Hard"" was a crudely entertaining action movie with comic villains and a couple of humorous exchanges in addition to the usual violent sequences that had Bruce Willis as Officer John McClane running barefoot through a sea of broken glass. The next episode in the franchise, ""Die Harder,"" switched the locale from the Nakatomi Building to Dulles and was essentially a repeat, duller than the first despite the enhanced special f/x. The third installment, ""Die Hardest of All,"" or was it, ""Die, Whether You Like It Or not""?, put Willis back in New York with Samuel Jackson as his unwilling sidekick and Jeremy Irons as the least believable German heavy imaginable. It wasn't up to the standard of the original -- so few copies are -- but it was more entertaining than the second installment. I know. I got the titles all mixed up but these sequels come thick and fast and seem to pile atop one another like cow flops.",2008
9,"When a criminal plot is in place to take down the entire computer and technological structure that supports the economy of the United States (and the world), it's up to a decidedly ""old school"" hero, police detective John McClane, to take down the conspiracy, aided by a young hacker.",2007
7,"""Live Free or Die Hard"" is quite a refreshing piece of entertainment this summer in the wake of so many effects-driven computer simulated action/fantasy films. With its silly title, smart-alleck lead character (Bruce Willis as Bruce Willis doing John McClane), and loads of old fashioned stunts involving cars, SUV's, elevator shafts, big rigs, helicopters, fighter jets, and collapsing highway bridges, this flick is a great piece of shattered-glass entertainment--a throwback to the late 1980's and early 1990's when movies like the original ""Die Hard"" changed the face of movie action.",2007
9,"12 years on; McClane is bald, estranged from his family and feels increasingly like an anachronism. There is a strong 'post-9/11' vibe, a muted color scheme and a strangely sombre tone that permeates proceedings. The film covers more terrain (literally) than it's predecessors and the action is slightly episodic as a result of shoehorning a series of mini-showdowns into a plot about cyber-terrorists and an attempt to shut down the US infrastructure. It's handled more deftly and inventively than you might expect, but it's not an obvious marriage.",2007

1,"This is without a doubt one of the worst films I have ever seen. A tired, lazy procession of clichés which lacks even a fraction of the flair or imagination of any of its predecessors. What Bruce Willis was thinking when he signed up for this God only knows; next time an A-list action movie star announces that he only signed up to revive a well-worn franchise ""because the script was right"", you should go ahead and assume they got the word ""script"" confused with the word ""money"". I just wish for once they would be honest about it and save everybody's time.",2008

1,Thanks To IMDb's silly rule about lengthy reviews I will get straight to the point of this review of why I believe this is a pathetic attempt at a Die Hard movie.,2009
9,"First off, I'd like to say that I really enjoyed this movie. I have read a lot of the bad hype that the flick has receieved, and I believe that this is partly due to the fact that people go into these types of movies expecting amazing advances in cinematography as well as a gripping and dramatic plot. Well, I hate to burst everybody's bubble, but that is really not the purpose of this type of movie. These bad reviews make me wonder just how serious you have to be (or just how snobby a critic) going into the theater to hate this type of movie making.",2007
8,"The idea to do a film of Ghost Rider actually came after Nicholas Cage had his head skinned and his skull set on fire by critics, as a punishment for Knowing. The scenes where Johnny Blaze apparently has Cage's old facial features are the only CGI effects in the entire film.",2011
7,"If you go into this movie hoping to see Academy Award caliber acting or a dramatic plot that's going to move you emotionally, then you're going to the wrong movie. However, if you're looking for a movie that's a lot of fun and is going to keep you entertained, then this is exactly what you're looking for.",2007
1,"Ghost Rider is hilarious. Unspeakably, hysterically funny. Sadly, though, it's all unintentional humor. The movie manages to pack in every comic book and action movie cliché imaginable, laughable casting, an illogical script, wooden acting, and jarring direction for straight-faced amusement.",2007
6,"Ghostrider is a brilliantly designed character . The chain ,the bike , the flaming skull for a head -he's just plain cool. In fact hes TOO cool - it seems that in any comic , cartoon or game hes involved with, he always comes out as the most interesting thing.",2007
9,"Okay, this movie has taken a lot of heat (ohhhh) but in fact, it's good at what it is. You can't criticize a Snickers Bar for not being Creme Brulee. This is not High Art. It's a movie based on a comic book, and it does a great job of bringing that comic book to life, and of keeping the comic book nature of the story intact. This isn't a bad thing-- it is what it is. It's not a chick flick, it's not clever and witty, it's not deep and mysterious. It's a comic book brought to life on the big screen with nice fx and a decent score and appropriate acting. It's fun. It's a hoot. The bad guys are bad, the good guys are good-- and the end isn't a cop out which is nice. If you are not the audience for which this movie is intended, you will not like this film. If you are, you won't be disappointed. Is it as strong a movie as Spiderman? No. But the story isn't as strong either. It is, however, a good yarn, something my kids liked-- something I liked, and I'm not even a comic book guy.",2007
7,"There won't be any Academy Awards for ""Ghost Rider,"" and deservedly so. Great cinema it ain't. It is fun stuff, though, and very much in the spirit of the Marvel comic book of the same name. Nicolas Cage works well in the role; his dead-pan humor is well suited to the role of motorcycle stuntman Johnny Blaze, and the scene in which he attempts to explain himself to his long-lost girlfriend is classic stuff, full of awkward pauses and an eyebrow put to good use.",2007
10,"I am still in awe of this movie. There are scenes that will make you go ""how did they do that?"" and some scenes that are just cool. At the beginning when Johnny Blaze first figures out his powers / curse as the GhostRider he lays both hands on his motorcycle and it begins to transform itself into a really cool bike.... Almost like it goes to 'just bones' which is the point. There are a lot of cool action scenes in the movie but the best part is that there is actually a good storyline as well!!!! I was not very happy with the fact that he doesn't end up with the girl, but at least we know that she does love him and he loves her, so that's something! I am very impressed. Also Nicolas Cage is one of my favorite actors!!!",2007
10,"Best special effects I have ever seen in 2007! This movie was really good I thought that Roxanne would faint when she had first seen Johnny in ghost rider form. But this was a good versus evil film and that is how i like these films, to be a fight between good and evil and to save the girl of your dreams from dying in the hands of the devil's son who is way more eviler than the devil himself. Blackheart was super creepy when I had first watched this film and I thought he sort of liked Roxanne at first, he looked at her like he wanted to kiss her or something. But when he told Johnny to get that contract or he would kill his girl. He looked at her I thought he would run over there and kiss her or something. ",2011
10,"I got to see Ghost Rider at a sneak recently in Los Angeles and I was pleasantly surprised. Johnson has said in his interviews that he didn't believe in taking it too seriously and I think that was the right way to go because the film is a lot of fun. It balances humor and horror and adventure in a way that I haven't seen since Army of Darkness, the 3rd in the Evil Dead Trilogy. Nicolas Cage is hilarious. He has a face that is like a silent movie actors and I kept thinking about movies like Nosferatu or Phantom of the Opera. He's been waiting for years to play this role and you can really feel how much fun he's having just going crazy, especially in the first scene when Johnny Blaze turns into the Ghost Rider. The movie just borders on the edge of campy but always manages to pull itself back before going to far. And Sam Elliott. It's got Sam Elliot. What more could you ask for?",2007

9,"I'm a long time fan - 30 years or so. It's about a cursed leather clad flaming skeleton, blazing a trail in the Western deserts and towns, doing cool stunts on a flaming motor bike, and beating up the scum of the earth. If this highly visual and somewhat atavistic image gratifies you, then I think you'll be well pleased. I was. If this doesn't appeal to you, then it's a solid actioner with a logical(ish) resolution, and for us baldy guys has the added fantasy quotient of seeing Nick Cage with his hair restored.",2007

There will be no Oscar nominations from it (wink wink) but who wants that in a movie such as this. I wanted to be entertained and was. My kids also loved it. I've read reviews saying the movie was cheesy and it was, but really so has every movie based on a comic book. That's kind of what I",2007

His target: Blackheart, the Devil's son, and three elemental demons, Earth, Wind, and Water, who intend to create hell on Earth. As Blaze struggles to gain control of his powers, his childhood sweetheart Roxanne returns, and he's forced to protect her from the evil forces around him. Though not the best comic book movie ever made, this movie was entertaining just like I wanted it to be.",2007
8,"Sometimes, I think critics and such miss the point of a comic book movie. A comic book movie is not about romance, or exploration of self or moral sermons or parodies of real life. Comic books are about imagination and they move fast while taking some things for granted to let you work out on your own. A comic book movie should be similar in my opinion. To me, Spiderman is the best comic book movie of all so I will compare to that a lot. The Dolph Lundgren Punisher (not to be confused with the more recent far superior Thomas Jane Punisher) was one of the worst.",2007
10,"And it was awesome. Seriously, wasn't expecting to have such a good time with it after all the internet bitching. It's a straight on popcorn flick, unabashedly pure fun. Was nice to see something like that after all of the recent academy flicks. Nicolas Cage is back in a big way. He goes totally mental when he changes into the Ghost Rider -- you have to see it! Screaming and laughing while his skin is exploding and burning, it's intense (surprisingly so for a PG13). Sam Elliott is one of my favorite actors and he does an awesome job as well. And Wes BEntley (where has he been?) shows that he remains one of the best actors of his generation. Eva Mendes is hot!!!!! There were so many huge set pieces here -- the biggest one would be a spoiler so I won't give it. But the final fight is awesome, reminded me of Raiders of the Lost Ark with the spirits flying all over the place. Warning to kids thought -- it's scary at times. Pay attention to the rating!",2007

I don't know how accurate it is to the original, or how the comedy and action balance out with what has been established in the comics. All I do know is that it was an enjoyable film, and I was thoroughly entertained. Isn't that all a movie is supposed to be? I have highly recommended this film to all of my friends, but I must warn you: if you're not used to horror pictures, this one has a few horror elements, so brace yourself for some unpleasant stuff. Other than that, the action was exciting, the humor was funny and the romance, although a little over the top, was sweet. This film garners a solid 8 out of 10.",2007

8,"First off, let me say I am not some Ghost Rider or Nic Cage fanboy.. That being said, this movie was pretty damn entertaining! I am familiar with the character in the comic and it is a very faithful adaptation. THe acting is top notch with the exception of Wes Bentley who conveys no real emotion... Eva Mendes is hot as ever, Nic Cage does a fantastic job and looks fantastic for a man in his 40's. Sam Elliot was perfect as the Caretaker and Peter Fonda does well also.. Lastly, I don't know what all the negative comments on the CGI was for...I thought it looked pretty damn good myself... anyone who likes comic movies or action movies that are a little darker that spiderman and superman (think Punisher in the sense it is more dark) needs to see this damn movie!!!!",2007
8,"I loved this movie...mainly because I love motorcycles and the forces of good and evil battling with each other. Ghostrider is a super entertaining movie, good action, thrilling rides, cool villains, I loved this movie. I especially liked the following that I noticed. I may be dating myself a little here but the not so subtle homage to Easy Rider was definitely there and appreciated...not only was the devil played by Captain America himself, Peter Fonda, but Johnny Blaze's regular chopper is a blend of the most notable motorcycles in bike history, the Captain America and Billy bikes from Easy Rider. The characters and the special effects are good enough to keep you watching, the acting is all as good as you would expect for this type of movie. Love Sam Elliot...this guy always plays a cool western type character...I think he must be this way in real life as well.",2007

10,Review: By Morgan Stewart,2007
7,"When I sat down to watch Bridge to Terabithia, I did not know quite what to expect. From what I had seen in the trailers, I thought the movie would be about two kids that end up in some magical world, similar to the Chronicles of Narnia (clearly, I did not read the book). Needless to say that I was surprised when actually seeing the movie. I shall not spoil the story for those who have yet to see the movie, but I will say that, in my opinion, this movie is for a more mature audience than one would think. Rather than being a fairytale for youngsters, the movie actually gives the viewer an inside look in a young boy's life and all the troubles he faces, concerning school, family and friends. The setting overall was a lot darker than expected as well. I can be short about the acting. The child-stars that play the lead roles did a great job and really brought the characters to life. On this subject I must give some credit to the director as well, as it is very difficult to work with children and to get them to play the part exactly the way you want them too. One final aspect of the movie that deserves mentioning is the fact that it does not lean on special effects. Although there is a fair amount of nice CGI present in the film, the story dominates. Which in my opinion, is a lot better than the other way around. Overall, I found the movie very enjoyable, but I would advise parents of young children to find out more about the movie, before deciding on whether or not you'll let your kids watch it.",2007
8,"A very well mastered family movie with a positive message that addresses topical themes for children in a poignant, focused manner. The children depicted are very real and likable (well, except for the ones you're supposed to dislike, that is), and easy to identify with. The movie is a faithful and touching adaptation of the beloved children's classic book.",2007
10,"When I heard back in August 2006 that they were making the award winning book ""Bridge to Terabithia"" into a movie, I immediately reread the book. But, it took my only a few hours, and I had months to wait. Today, February 16th, I saw it, and I have a few things all of you might want to know. This movie is very kid friendly, if you are very concerned about what your kids see, then, this might be good. There are a few imaginary ""scary"" figures, but it's not like a horror movie. The actors did so wonderfully well, it scares me. Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia were always favorites of mine, but they surprised me anyway. They played the roles well. It teaches you a lesson, also, and it shows some how to use an imagination. I thought this movie was marvelous, and it deserves to be watched by millions. It couldn't have done better.",2007
9,"Great movie for all ages I took my five year old and fiancé they loved it.....Josh Hutcherson was great in this and so was Anna Sophia Robb .....People actually cried and clapped after the show it touches your inner child...It will take you through a life experience that not all kids go through in life but you will be absorbed in the film as I was...If you are looking for a great film instead of all the kids movies that rely on jokes that are used over and over ...go to this film and you will be satisfied with drama, light comedy and maybe slight depression of the reality it faces, but your spirit will be lifted as will your child's.",2007

8,"I have read about 30 reviews on here about this movie, many of them saying this film is not for kids. While I do understand where some parents may be coming from, I have to disagree. I personally read this book when I was in 5th grade. That was 11 years ago, yet somehow that book still sticks in my mind. I honestly had completely forgotten what the book was about, but I remember it being about two kids. Therefore, seeing the movie was like experiencing the story all over again. I DO think this is a good movie for children 10+. Like I already mentioned I was 11 when I read the book for the first time and I remember it having quite a positive impact on me. I didn't remember the novel or what it was about, however I did remember that it touched me in a way that very few books ever did. Kids 10+ need to see this movie.",2007

10,"Saw the premiere and the movie has all the earmarks of a major hit. You never know for sure with American audiences but this is a very beautiful and engaging film. It REALLY outclasses any number of recent movies marketed at kids and it is one of the few I've seen that shows honest portrayals of both children and adults. No one, not even the bullies, is a stereotype or caricature. The novel is a masterpiece, but this film holds its own. With so many films, you walk out, whether amused or annoyed, and soon forget most of what you saw. Not so with Bridge--it stays with you, as it should. Go and enjoy...and then pass the word.",2007

10,"I went into this movie not knowing what it was about. From the trailers I had assumed that it was kind of like The Never Ending Story, but I found that the trailers were terribly misleading. Since I have never read the book, I had no idea what it would really be like, but I was very pleasantly surprised. I won't get into the plot because I'm terrible at explaining plot lines well, but I hope that it will suffice when I say that I left the theater with my mind blown. I turned to my friend and was like, ""Wow, I actually want to turn around and see that again, right now."" but I couldn't because I had to go to work. It's unusual to be saying this because I normally don't like to re-watch movies so soon, but I've found that ever since I left the theater, I just want to go back. I've been trying to drag my friends there with me because I think that everyone should see this, but unfortunately, the add campaign may have ruined all chances of that happening. I find that every time I ask one of my friends to go with me, they say that there is no way they are going to watch that movie, which means I'll probably have to see it alone when I watch it again (I will definitely be watching this again). It was so good that I cried during the movie. I only remember crying in one other movie ever.",2007
9,"I had read the book before i saw the movie and I didn't think that they would do a good job with the movie and stay true to the novel. I was quite surprised though. The movie stayed true to the book and I think that it is a very good movie for 7-13 year olds especially. The parts that I really enjoyed were when the characters imaginations came to life in Terabithia. It made everything seem so real. The ending was very magical and moving..I am not usually an emotional person but i found myself on the verge of tears. The Acting was really good as well. The young girl that played Leslie did a great job as well as Zooey Deschanel playing the kids teacher. Overall, I was very impressed and I was surprised at how good of a job was done to make the movie out of the book. The acting, characters, sets, storyline were very well done. This is a movie that I would definitely recommend to see to everyone, but especially if you are going to see it with children/ teenagers.",2007

Well written and very likable cast .Very brave .My girlfriend and i were the only two adults without kids and i thought this really is a kids movie but by the end i would have to say it was a little much for kids under 6 or 7 it is a very sad movie .The location was very pleasing .The two main girls were very well cast very engaging and you will see the boy in upcoming films as he is a very sellable kid .I would have to say well worth the price of a ticket,2007

It's still one of my favorite books as both an adult and a writer. It has since become a modern classic of children's literature, a book beloved by children and adults alike. It's also one of the most controversial children's books of all time - one of the most banned and challenged.",2007

8,"I was able to see a preview screening for this at the MPAA last Friday and thought it was wonderful. The film does such a good job of showing us how a child's imagination works, and is able to really show us how they're imagining Terabithia together. I loved it! The movie is very faithful to the book but also brings new life to the material. The actors who play Jesse (Hutcherson) and Leslie (AnnaSophia Robb) were both fantastic and literally could have stepped straight out of the book. Given their respective ages, I was very impressed with the level of acting talent, especially as the film draws on some adult-related themes. The visuals were fantastic and potential viewers of this film should know that the ""fantasy"" element was not at all overdone. Overall, I found the film fantastic, very well-adapted for the big screen, and well-balanced. I highly recommend it.",2007

5,"Having not read the book, I had no notion what the story was about, except that it had two kids and their adventures in the land of Terabithia. Boy was I surprised. I found the movie confusing, mean, and upsetting. They really never developed the back story of the kids, to explain why they are some what misfit. There wasn't much activity in or about Terabithia except at the very end of the movie. There's a creepy teacher, who I felt was not developed as the kind caring understanding type of teacher but as being just a little to interested in the boy, when she only takes him on a field trip into the city. Last, The death of the girl. When the girl drowns in the creek, I was shocked. I had tears flowing down my face. It was very sad and I really wasn't expecting this twist. This movie is advertised as a children's movie. I can imagine how this would really upset children. So I say, the reviews/advertising, should have have warned me of the true nature of this story.",2007
1,"This film is unbelievably biased. It is pure anti-Soviet cold-war drivel and it is historically inaccurate. Robert Gates says that the CIA began giving aid to Islamic fighters in Afghanistan months **before** the Soviet invasion. Jimmy Carter signed an order on July 3, 1979 to give aid to the Mujahedeen. It had the effect of drawing the Russians into the Afghan trap. ""The day that the Soviets officially crossed the border,"" Zbigniew wrote to President Carter, ...we gave to the USSR its Vietnam War"". Charlie Wilson's importance is wildly blown way out of proportion. The real-life Wilson had always been a right wing government good-old-boy who liked war. He was a commie-hating cold-war warrior. In the film we are lead to think that Wilson was simply a good time loving, womanizing, good old boy Congressman that never really grew up until he saw in person poor Afghan refugees: themselves poorly drawn caricatures of Afghan citizens. At this moment in the film Wilson changed and found a righteous cause. Born again Charlie!! Pure Hollywood nonsense! The real Wilson was not a nice guy. He was a friend of Nicaraguan tyrant Anastasio Samoza. Wilson's buddy in the movie (Philip Seymour Hoffman's character) is based on the CIA operative Gust Avrakotos. Army colonels led a coup in Greece in the 1960s; Avrakotos was the CIA main contact with the totally horrible fascist regime. Avrakotos fled Greece in the late 70s, with a very nasty reputation. The consequences of this cold war game are ignored by this crappy Hollywood movie. The weapons the U.S. supplied the Mujahedeen were used to wage a lengthy, bloody civil war in Afghanistan. Reagan's claim that the Afghan fighters were the moral equivalent of America's founding fathers is absurd. More brainless propaganda. Half the CIA money went to the monster Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, who in his youth threw acid in the face of an unveiled women. The CIA and US government would ally with anybody against the USSR. The terrorists received Stinger missiles, US Army training, and lots of money. The Taliban and the group that came to be known as Al-Qaida came from the Afghan civil war and were taught by the USA how to fight. There was little real concern for the fate of Afghanistan and its people. Washington never cared about the Afghan people in the first place ... and they still don't care. They are just pawns in The Great Game. The movie is a formulaic cliché, with it's warped fixation on the importance of the individual and its disregard for facts. Most Americans -- and reviewers here -- apparently take movies like this seriously, but this kind of crap makes the USA a joke to the rest of the world.",2012
1,"Tom Hanks bring me good expectations but when I saw propaganda I got disgusted right away. I was fighting that war myself and I remember clearly that I had some afghan friends on our side as well. Also communism was not horrible especially under Brezhnev rule(those were not 1930's anymore and not civil war in 1920's). I see antirussian propaganda everywhere these days but this disgusted me more then others because you show taliban like some sort of freedom fighters(but now you view them different aren't you?). Those freedom fighters take skin off alive Russian soldiers. Also russians never dropped children toy mines that's piteful lies. And the pilots scene also was arrogant ""Hey let's hunt some woman and children. Btw I cheated on my wife. Happy hunting."" Just like CIA spread lies during the war Hollywood spreads lies 20 years after the war. USA has honor or what?",2010

9,"Mike Nichols in finest form. I was not a fan of ""Closer"", so it's refreshing to see him again right back on top with this comedy set in the darkest of circumstances. Just one slip in tone could have wrecked this compelling picture but Nichols and his very strong A-list cast never put a foot wrong in this biopic of a deeply flawed but utterly compelling Congressman.",2007
9,"I like Tom Hanks, and he is one of few actors who will draw me into the theatre regardless of any misgivings I may have concerning the film. I worried about Mr. Hanks return to ""light comedy"" as this is the arena where he made the transition from TV to film- remember ""Big""? Well, ""Charlie Wilson's War"" is not light comedy. It is political satire, and extremely well-written political satire at that. The script is the star of this film, and the word-smithing by Aaron Sorkin is some of the best on offer this year.",2007
2,"Yes, I walked out. I don't suffer stupidity very well. I made it one hour and ten minutes into this picture before the death-blow forced me from the theater: Charlie celebrating the end of the cocaine investigation.",2008
8,"Aaron Sorking raises the same questions as Shakespeare did or does. How could they possibly know so much about the inner workings of palace life. Here like in The West Wing, Sorkin opens surprising doors that are hardly a shock but seem ton confirm our worst fears. Everything is so casual and at the same time so directly responsible for so many people's lives. A puffy Tom Hanks tells us one way or another that things can be manipulated with semi pure intentions but without weighing the consequences and Julia Roberts in a blond southern hairdo reminds us of the powers harbored in the sidelines. The subject is serious but the treatment is light, intelligent but light. Philip Seymour Hoffman, as the invisible middle man, steals every scene he is in, just like Charles Laughton did in every movie he was in.The dialogue is fast but not fast enough for us not to catch up and discover that this is not an ordinary comedy. The seemingly casual pace filled with strokes of wit and provocation grants another badge of honor in the Mike Nichol's collection.",2008
8,"Told in flashback, the film opens in 1989 with Charlie being given award for his role in the defeat of Communism. I must admit my heart sank as at the thought of have to endure yet another earnest, somewhat boring and overlong life story. How wrong was I, because that short scene is as close as the film ever gets to boring.",2007
1,"The filmmakers neglected to connect the dots--that is, the sequence of events and choices that led from Charlie Wilson and the anti-Soviet mujaheddin to Al Qaeda and Osama Bin Laden and eventually to 9/11. The filmmakers of course neglect to tell us the back-story--why were the Soviets in Afghanistan?--but that omission pales in comparison to their failure to reveal that support for Islamicist extremists in Afghanistan in the name of rabid anti-communism ultimately strengthened the hand of anti-western forces and was a big contributing factor to the mess that we find ourselves in today (9/11, terrorist networks, a prolonged ground war in Afghanistan, etc.). Because these consequences are not spelled out, the movie leaves the viewer feeling sympathetic to Mr. Wilson (hey, check out his latest projects on the Internet) instead of seeing him as an individual whose actions were contrary to the best interests of his country and the West as a whole.",2008
8,"In one of the better movies of the year, Tom Hanks stars as Congressman Charlie Wilson in this sardonically funny and extremely relevant (given reasonably current events) historical comedy-drama surrounding the 1980s Afghan/Soviet fiasco. The Soviets were attacking Afghanistan killing hundreds of people. Why should anyone care? People are dying, right? No, the reason the United States got involved through Charlie Wilson was because the Afghans, in fear they would get blown to sh_t, started illegally coming into Pakistan which in turn p_ssed Pakistani President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq off. Charlie Wilson in an effort to fix this situation teamed up with the sixth richest woman and religious fanatic in Texas, Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts) and a amusing and robust American spy for the CIA, Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman) to help supply Afghans with high-tech weapons to destroy Soviet fight air-craft that would try and attack their land.",2007
10,"Charlie's Wilson's War demonstrates with deft veracity just how futile wars can be, especially to the very people who spend countless hours and finances to fund them. Virtuoso performances and remarkably memorable characters teamed with a riotously sarcastic script catapult the film, helmed by the continuously unpredictable Mike Nichols, to the top of the year's best. Politics has never been so much fun.",2007
9,"I quit watching ""The West Wing"" after Aaron Sorkin quit writing and producing. It just wasn't the same. Imagine my thrill at seeing a film that he wrote again. It has been a long time - The American President, A Few Good Men. His script was a beautiful blend of humor and tragedy. He made a compelling story believable, and made me weep at the same time.",2007
2,"Things began very well with this film, I found myself enamoured with the characters immediately and the backdrop drew me in. I was happily settled down into what I hoped would be an engaging look at a controversial part of American history. After all I knew the subject matter and I also knew it would be delicate but I seemed to be in capable hands.",2008
4,When the American movie industry tries to critically look at their own government they make damn sure it looks good even when it's bad.,2008
1,"It is more than a disappointment to see that the director who directed ""Whos'e Afraid of Virgina Woolf"" could resort himself directing such a mediocre script. I also find it offensive to draw parallels between the action of Charlie Wilson and the collapse of a superpower, which is supposed the be the motto of the story. The sad truth is that the result of Wilson's actions is not the end of Russia, which in fact is being rebuilt as an economic and military powerhouse, but 9/11 with all it's consequences. The film makes no such comparisons and, hence, becomes ridden with clichés rooted in one-sided perspective and an extremely dangerous superficial look at the Afgan - Soviet war. Charlie Wilson is not an American hero, but a fund-raiser for mujahadeen terrorists who in fact are killing the Americans oversees now. I had a very high expectation before this film was coming out, because I thought well finally someone even addresses the issue of Wilson's direct involvement in what eventually became the springboard of Muslim radicalism. But after watching it, I could not help being in a state of ""shock and awe"" without awe, of course. There is no historic justice in the film, and if there is anything commendable about movie, it is acting.",2007
4,"Very curious that Nichols and Hanks would team up for this, obviously they believe it. Strange because it should carry the title ""Charlie Wilson's War the Lie.",2008
1,"SPOILER - This film gives away plot points and discusses the ending. I hated this film - mostly for political reasons, but also for moral and aesthetic reasons. Politically, this film glorified war and military technology - blowing things up real good. We are led to cheer as the music swells and the Afghans use our weapons to blow the Ruskies to bits. And no U.S. soldiers put their lives on the line - so it's a fun war. Aesthetically, there isn't a touch of real human emotion in the film, just smug, privileged people being sarcastic, feeling superior, and doing whatever they want regardless of the consequences. And speaking of consequences, the film only makes a few small hints at what the arming of the Afghans actually led to. I had read an earlier draft of this script, and it ended on 9/11 - with Charlie Wilson realizing that things had gone horribly wrong. But that wouldn't leave the audience feeling good. This is a feel good movie about killing Ruskies. And it made me sick.",2008
8,"Nice to see a comedy for grown ups. Masterfully structured by Aaron Sorkin via Mike Nichols's own mastery. Mr Nichol's mastery is to present characters in all their shocking truth, from the sad and riveting Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor in ""Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf"" to the sad and riveting Julia Roberts, Clive Owen, Jude Law and Natalie Portman in ""Closer"". In ""Charlie Wilson's War"" the shocking truth is outside the characters and the sad and riveting Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams are at the service of something else, it's personal only to a point. Hanks has to bury his brilliance in single malts and Julia Roberts throws parties and introduces characters with blatant straightforwardness. Amy Adams witnesses and exist as a character, witnessing. An insurmountable task that Miss Adams manages to surmount, beautifully. It is Philip Seymour Hoffman's Gus with a t, however, that monopolized my attention. His character may not be a first but it is a first the way that Hoffman presented him to us. Someone who survives the disregard with which he's treated by the absolute conviction that he's smarter than all of them put together. Hoffman is superb. The pacing of the tale helps enormously not to fall in a myriad of useless questions. A sharp, short, smart, sad comedy and when was the last time I was able to say that?",2008

1,"Has Hollywood forgotten that the Cold War is over? That Russia is not the enemy? That the Soviet Union was fighting the groups who today are our enemies ... who hate us ... who call us infidels and other vile names ... and who we're now fighting in Afghanistan? If anything, we should have helped the Russians fight those maniacs posing as so-called freedom fighters. Under the pretext of telling a story about an unknown alcoholic, glib politician who miraculously develops a sense of duty to humanity ... while in a hot-tub with coke-snorting prostitutes ... this movie takes direct aim at the Soviet Union (i.e. the Russians). How dumb is that? Russia as the enemy? Duh! Oh, they were communists? Was that the problem? If this movie is some kind of anti-commie tirade, then the movie is way too late. There's no more Soviet Union! Everybody happy now? Is the world now a better, safer place? After the events of September 11, 2001, any country that attacks those groups that hate us and want to harm us is our allie. We would have been a lot better off if we had let the Russians stay in Afghanistan. Better them than us having to fight those criminal fanatics. Bashing the Soviet Union over their intervention in Afghanistan, which borders in their country, would be like bashing the Soviet Union for their actions in the Battle of Berlin in the closing days of World War Two. If the Soviets had not been willing to administer the final coup-de-grace against the Germans, WE would have had to do it and who knows how many thousands of American soldiers would have been lost. That we actually covertly aided and abetted groups in Afghanistan that openly hate us is absolutely amazing. Ugh!",2008
1,"Russians never dropped children's toys filled with explosives over Afghanistan, that never happened!!! Who did invention of that?? Hollywood portrays Russian army as horrible, dreadful troops of evil! That is disgusting!! United States President Jimmy Carter had accepted the view that ""Soviet aggression"" could not be viewed as an isolated event of limited geographical importance but had to be contested as a potential threat to the Persian Gulf region. The uncertain scope of the final objective of Moscow in its sudden southward plunge made the American stake in an independent Pakistan all the more important. A great deal of damage was done to the civilian children population by land mines.",2008
3,"I'm sure that the folks who made this movie think they're doing something wonderfully politically correct, because they manage to criticize U.S. wars in Afghanistan and particularly Iraq by suggesting that the U.S. does war well, but doesn't clean up afterward, thus sowing the seeds for future trouble. Furthermore, they do this without making Islamists the enemy AND without making Republicans the enemy, since it's the Republicans that are in office and are doing this supposedly great thing, bringing down the USSR by covertly supplying a war in Afghanistan.",2007
1,"The Soviet war in Afghanistan also known as the Soviet-Afghan War was a nine-year conflict involving Soviet forces supporting the Marxist People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) government against the largely Islamic fundamentalist Mujahideen insurgents. The latter group found support from a variety of sources including the United States, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and other Muslim nations in the context of the Cold War. The Islamists that fought also believed that they were responsible for the fall of the Soviet Union. Osama bin Laden, for example, was asserting the credit for ""the collapse of the Soviet Union ... goes to God and the mujahidin in Afghanistan ... the US had no mentionable role,"" but ""collapse made the US more haughty and arrogant.""Following the Soviet invasion, the United States supported diplomatic efforts to achieve a Soviet withdrawal. U.S. contributions to the refugee program in Pakistan played a major part in efforts to assist Afghans in need. This cross-border humanitarian assistance program aimed to increase Afghan self-sufficiency and help Afghans resist Soviet attempts to drive civilians out of the rebel-dominated countryside. During the period of Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, the U.S. provided about $3 billion in military and economic assistance to Afghans and the resistance movement.""The CIA made a historic mistake in encouraging Islamic groups from all over the world to come to Afghanistan.' The US provided $3 billion for building up these Islamic groups, and it accepted Pakistan's demand that they should decide how this money should be spent",2007
3,"after hearing many positive thoughts of how funny this is and also because tom hanks(in his early performances i might add) i decided to see it.also because it deals with Afghanistan and overall American military and political presence in foreign countries. it took me less then 30 minutes to see where this goes and after completing it i came to the conclusion that this is nothing but a propagandistic feature to justify, to the American public , certain aspects of how the world SHOULD be run. i actually find it disgusting in a specific aspect: that of giving the ""average"" American politician an imagine of ""well intentioned child"" by admitting that mistakes are being made. but those mistakes are not apparently made out of political form but that of a ""human"" one. basically this tells me that ""they"" are just like us conveniently forgetting the huge amount of power and INFORMATION they hold and WITHOLD from the general public. i will not go in details since one has to make up his/her own mind about this.but the viewer using his own practical day to day observations make me confident that will see throw the whole facade made up here. if you remember the older movie ""wag the dog"" with Robert De Niro, you will see how that feature PREDICTED this one...simply amazing.",2008

10,"Wizards of Waverly Place is a RARE gem in the vast sea of TV wasteland. This show is superbly written, incredibly well cast, and very well acted. If you like subtle ""inside-joke"" type humor - this show is for you. Yet at the same time it also does more than enough obvious physical humor to keep younger and more simple-minded viewers enthralled. For example, in one episode there is a bumbling weatherman named BAXTER KNIGHT. A hilarious homage to Ted Baxter, played by Ted Knight, on the Mary Tyler Moore Show more than 30 years ago - this reference will be totally lost on 99% of the viewing audience since few were born prior to 2000. In another episode, Selena steals the show by greedily sloughing down all the chocolate deserts on everyone's plates in a fancy restaurant. In that regard, Waverly Place is very similar to all those classic LOONEY TUNES cartoons we all know and love - it can appeal to you on both a very simple AND a very cerebral level. Young children who watch this show today can go back and watch it again in 20 years and they will have an entirely new appreciation all over again, on a whole new level. The entire cast is a joy to watch, but a special tip of the hat to Selena Gomez who is a true delight. This girl shines both as an actress and as a singer. Plus, she is a real sweetheart and totally deserves all the future success she is guaranteed to achieve. Unlike the Lindsays and Britneys of our sad generation, Selena sets a shining example of perfection as a performer, coupled with graceful elegance as a young lady - giving her legions of young fans a more than worthy role model. Selena has released three albums to date, and each one has been better than the last, which is no small feat considering they were all amazing. Most artists today release an album featuring one or two good songs, and 10 really bad ones. Not Selena - ALL of her songs are music to my ears. Here's hoping Waverly goes on at least 5 more seasons - add more music to the show and it can't miss! Thanks yet again to Disney for creating an environment that fosters creative and unique programming of enduring value for generations of all ages.",2011
8,"Before I start, I just have to say that I am not a big fan of the Disney Channel. I don't watch it for the most part. However, I was channel surfing one day and stumbled on this show. I thought, ""Well, I've never seen this before. Maybe it won't be as bad as some of the other stuff on here."" I have to say that I was right! This show is appealing for the ""tweenage"" population but also for people in other age groups (myself included). ""Wizards"" is also pretty funny (albeit some of the humor is a bit cheesy, I have to admit that it still gets a chuckle out of me!). Selena Gomez is definitely another rising star. I had never even heard of her before this show, but now I count myself as one of her fans. Jake T. Austin is simply adorable, and David Henrie is pretty cute ;) I think that viewers of most ages will probably enjoy this show (if they can stand some overplayed gags and corny jokes). Personally, I think it's a lot better than anything else they show on that channel, so if you're like myself and think that everything on Disney Channel is stupid and little-kiddish, I recommend that you check this show out - maybe it will change your opinion. It did mine!",2008
9,"I really like Disney shows and i thought this one looked pretty good. I watched and i thought it was great! The plot is unique and reminds me of harry potter or phil of the future(which is good!) The show is funny and the acting is great. Little kids, especially girls will probably stick to shows like hannah montana because they like the whole popstar plot and stuff like that. But i could see a 12 or 13 year old liking this show. The characters in the shows are new faces to me and i think they're pretty talented. Even though is pretty good it might not make it far in Disney because not many people are watching it, but bad reviews shouldn't get the show cancelled because this show probably won't get bad reviews! I definitely recommend this to all Disney fans! I am also going to recommend this to all my friends!:)",2007

1,"If you wondered whether Disney could broadcast a show with a character more spoiled than Paris, more shallow than Britney, more vapid than Jessica and more narcissistic than THE GIRLS NEXT DOOR, wonder no more. The amazing thing is Selena Gomez is, apparently, supposed to be the heroine. She's also supposed to be an outcast from the spoiled, shallow, vapid, narcissistic ""popular"" girls at school, which is no more believable here than it was for Hilary Duff in LIZZIE McGUIRE. Plots range from recycled BEWITCHED & I DREAM OF JEANNIE to ""parodies"" of HARRY POTTER. The older boy alternates between being a magical genius and being unable to master the complexities of his own shoelaces. The younger boy is just another of the smart-mouth ""wisecracking"" brats who have multiplied on TV like cockroaches in New York (and with the same appeal). The dad is the stereotypical dumb TV dad, and the mom... well, she's not totally awful. But all pales beside the hideous, loathsome, and yet horribly fascinating (like a bad car accident) spectacle of Ms. Lopez' smug, self-satisfied, snotty performance . And, again, she's the HEROINE.",2008

It's nice to see a show that incorporates something else.",2009

In the recent years I have strayed from the Disney channel due to the recent decline in quality and yet I find myself watching this with renewed enthusiasm for the network. The Humor is standard of a Disney channel show but thanks to the personality the actors are able to bring to the table it more then makes for it.I especially enjoy the work of Selena Gomez, the way she delivers her lines are far beyond those of say Raven-Symone and other Disney channel stars. I guess its taken Disney channel awhile to find a diamond in the patch of coal they call programming. In the words of the immortal bard..Miley Cyrus/Hannah Montana ""YA Think?!""",2008
10,"I must say, even though I am now officially considered an adult, I enjoy Wizards very much. I believe that no one is ever ""too old"" to watch Disney - they do not only target children, their movies always have a deep and highly philosophical meaning, yet they are entertaining and accessible to children. Although not all of their shows are as interesting, I find Wizards to be not only entertaining but also very endearing. I pride Disney on their amazing casting, in everything. They appeal to different audiences by including many different elements - I for one, look for the romantic part of the story, yet quite enjoy everything that comes with it. Another thing I would like to congratulate Disney for is their ability to include many different dimensions into the same work, be it a show, a movie or something else. I find Wizards an amazing way to wind down and relax after a long and hard day at university, and how can a girl not enjoy watching David Henrie? ;) Although I must say that all of the actors are very talented and the come together in an amazing tandem. I wish them luck and joy in their work! Keep it up! And Thank You :)",2010

The situations are the only mildly clever thing about the show, and they are not clever in the least. The acting is over the top, again, to appeal to kids, but really....does it have to be this bad. Every characters' action and delivery at every moment reminds me of a bad Kramer impersonation. This has a low budget and it shows. Every special effect is either a bad green screen effect or a digital effect shrinking or enlarging something (A little chocolate loving troll and Alex's big head) So, if you're a little kid, you'll probably enjoy the wacky antics of this annoying family, but if you're over ten, then why are you watching this?

I thought something in 2008 would be better than something that was made in 2001 (Sabrina The Teenage Witch). In conclusion, its a funny show, but they should work on the magic part, A lot.

Not only is this show a waste of airtime, the lead ""actress"" Selena Gomez looks like a pig. Jake T. Austin's character needs some Ritalin.

There is nothing worse then prospect or actuality of burying your lover and your friend. I know this movie got a lot of negative reviews but when you see your life mirrored on the big screen you can't help but be moved by her struggle to move on and his undying love for her. I see another reviewer said to keep the boyfriends/husbands home, these people obviously have not faced such tragic circumstances.

Hilary Swank is great in this romantic comedy, an edgy departure for the actor. Swank thrives--she never forces the humor, completely natural. She embodies a humanity and spirit in Holly that makes her vulnerable and funny in the story's context. Gerald Bulter is boldly charming as Holly's late husband Gerry, the Irishman full of life and dreams.

10,"My most favorite romantic chick flick the last two years!! What makes this movie so great is if you have no expectation. Because of reviews and not thinking Hilary Swank could pull off romantic made this movie shine. She pulls it off and the movie is way better than the reviews. Tear Jerker! The shining happy moments are definitely the comedy relief Harry Connick Jr. brings. He is good in this movie... sexy... charming and hilarious. This movie has a great ending and just is so beautiful. I read half the book and wow, the movie makes the book look bad. The movie is better than the book!",2007
1,"I've felt the need to write the first movie review on my profile. If no news is good news, I have a lot of news. It started with some lame, god-awful song. The opening scene went from the characters, Holly and Gery, played by Hilary Swank and Gerard Butler (who had absolutely no chemistry at all), fighting to having sex. The second scene? Gery's funeral. What?! Oh right, a brain tumor, I guess...",2010
1,"A real good book turned into a really bad movie. I have no words for the badness of this film. Swank is only giving a big horse smile, Butler is so pathetic showing his affection. It is just sooo bad, it made me cringe. I only endured it to the end as I hoped this whole thing would at least have a good ending. But no - even that is non-committal and empty. Good Lord - what a waste of time and money. One of the rare films that leaves me embarrassed watching.",2011
8,"I am so glad I went against the many negative reviews of this movie... because it was fantastic! It has stuck with me in the several hours since I've seen it. Claims that Hilary Swank and Gerard Butler have no chemistry just are not true- the characters are different, and they clash at times, but this shouldn't be misconstrued. One can definitely see the love they have for each other, though the ways they express it are very different. Never has a movie pushed me to the brink of tears so many times! Sure, in Titanic we all (or was it just me...?) cried when we realized Leo's character had died, but P.S. I Love You brings that feeling several times over. It is so relatable- how would we act if we were completely grief-stricken with nothing to comfort us? I love this movie- both my friend that saw it with me and myself fully intend on buying it on DVD when it is released. Highly recommended. Don't forget Kleenex! *Kudos to Kudrow who is freaking hilarious!*",2007
10,"Okey ladies i went to see P.S. I Love You last night with a girl friend now that we are both back in the OC for winter break. I have to say this movie is all i hoped it would be and more.

7,"I am often disappointed when I go to see a movie, and all the good parts that were shown in the trailer- were the ONLY good parts in the movie.

10,I have never felt compelled to leave a comment about a film until i saw P.S. I Love You. The emotional journey of the story was engulfing and intense. The comical and dramatic aspects of the film were both nurtured and explored deeply. I've never cried and laughed at the same time. ,2008

1,"I typically don't write reviews of movies, but I just felt the need to warn people how awful this movie was. I like Hillary Swank but she was the complete wrong character to be cast in this movie. I just thought all of the plot lines were just way too unbelievable. I did not think Lisa Kudrow was cast well in this movie, nor was Harry Connick, Jr. Not even sure why that character was inserted into the movie. There was nothing funny or even sad about this movie. It left me emotionless. The love pursuit by Gerry was just so cheesy and non believable. I also cringed every time they did one of those cheesy flashback scenes to when Gerry was alive. I also thought seeing his friend sleep with Hillary and tell stories about Gerry when he was alive to be kind of morbid. ",2008

1,"As an American ex pat, living in the UK for 8 years, this movie was a total embarrassment. Who watches this stuff (in the USA?)? I only watched it because my 12 year old was having a cinema party and THEY wanted to watch it. The acting was atrocious, the story line was probably written by a cheerleader who likes Ireland or something. It was Hollywood at it's worst. Please, if you think you are going to do a film partly about a European country, have some Europeans on board who will advise you how schmaltzy a film can be for the rest of the world (and don't release it over here). The theatre was pretty empty and I can see why. Waste of 6 pounds for me. The main actress was so annoying to watch and look at, those teeth, my goodness.... Only redeeming qualities were the shots of NYC and Ireland and a rather good conversation between the mother and daughter towards the end. It wasn't worth watching for those reasons however.",2008
9,"To be fully honest, I'm not one for what we know as ""chick-flicks"" because of their tendency to be as predictable as a crystal ball or as cheesy as cheese.

6,"Holly (Hillary Swank) has been married for a number of years to handsome Gerry (Gerard Butler), an Irish gentleman. Wed at 19, he is the only love of her life and they have big plans for the future. Sadly, however, Gerry is stricken with cancer and dies, leaving Holly desolate. But, much to her surprise, letters start arriving from Gerry, under unusual circumstances, letters that provide encouragement for Holly to move forward with her life. Gerry suggests that Holly do some karaoke and take a trip to Ireland, where she should learn to fish and visit his relatives. It doesn't' hurt that Holly has two loving friends (Lisa Kudrow and Gina Gershon), a hovering mother (Kathy Bates), and a good-looking new friend (Harry Connick, Jr.) looking out for her, also. But, can Holly truly overcome the serious blow that life has given her? This is a sweet movie but, I must confess, I was a wee bit disappointed. Yes, I loved the basic story and the cast is beyond terrific. Swank is quite nice as the young widow while Butler is greatly engaging as the husband, with many of his scenes told in flashback. In fact, Butler is a new favorite among American women, thanks to Dear Frankie, and let us all hope we see much more of him. Kudrow, Gershon, Bates, Connick Jr., and some of the Irish players are just right, too, breathing more life into a script that is erratic and sometimes contrived. Of course, the sets in Manhattan and Ireland are very wonderful, as are the costumes and great camera work. But, the film could have used more careful direction and editing, in my view. However, all fans of romantic comedy should not miss it, no. As the fountain of romcom films has considerably dried up in the last two years, any new entry is a hearty meal for the starving. Just do not expect another Music and Lyrics this time around.",2007
1,"Please understand, I am commenting on the film and not the book here, the book was fantastic, funny,sad, warm really true to life, Holly had a great family, brothers and a sister who all had different tales to tell, I felt a part of this family, I loved the way they all got together at Christmas and at the barbecue.My favorite part in the book was when the younger brother filmed the girls on a night out and then won a prize!!!!!! The sad part was when Holly's elder brother was made redundant and his wife left him!!! Holly coped with all of these problems and worries as would have been expected of someone in her situation When Gerry went into the travel agents and booked the tickets for Holly and her friends was a very touching scene and I read it over and over How can the author let the film makers do this to her fantastic book how disappointed was I to see the film, there was only one thing in common with the book ""Gerry died"" and that was all The book was in Ireland, the film was in New York, the family was a warm and comforting one in Irealand, the film had a sister who was hardly present and the mother a sad old cow whose husband had left her NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BOOK Why do you guys buy books and then change them? If the book is a success then do the film as was the book I think that the people who never read the book will probably love the film, I think that the people who read the book and then saw the film will probably hate it Sorry to be so negative, however I am really angry at seeing a great book completely ruined Thanks for listening I feel better now",2008
1,"I'm watching this now and I had to look see if I'm the only person in the world who thinks that this is probably the worst movie in the world. Irish accents - terrible. Irish ring tones on phones - no way! Chemistry between Hilary Swank and Gerard Butler, non-existent. Storyline - a shambles. I've watched an hour because I thought that it would get better but it's getting worse. As far Harry Connick Jnr. oh dear. It's trying to be cute and meaningful all at once but it's neither. A good movie about a dead husband (what a sentence !!) Ghost. That has real emotion even if it also has Demi Moore. OK, have decided, can't watch anymore. ",2010

1,"This movie had no character development, comical sequences like Davy Jones and Tia Dalma, we never really got to fully understand Keith Richard's character Captain Teague, and many other disappointing sequences of just action. The special effects were unbelievable, the music was unique, but it doesn't matter because the movie was pointless. I felt no nostalgia or any sense of good dialogue it sounded like they were all playing a different character especially Davy Jones. We never really got to understand Jack Sparrow's purpose as a pirate neither did we understand ""Bootstrap"" Bill Turner. Elizabeth's relationship with Jack never ignited any further neither did Will's relationship with her. Why did Weatherby Swann die or how did he die? At World's End is a huge disappointment to fellow fans like myself and too many critics alike.",2007

1,"I guess when you have a large budget, devoted fans, and an all-star cast, you don't have to write a script. This movie went from nowhere to nowhere at a glacial pace, with a confusing, tedious plot that defied all good rules of writing. Uninspiring, overly-staged sword fights occasionally interrupt the tedium. Not only does the main plot (whatever it is) tank, the side plots also go nowhere. The pirate lords are lame, Calypso drains the bath, and our shrill-voiced pirate king is a Hollywood bimbo. By the end, I was hoping someone would rip my heart out so I could be relieved of having to see one more minute of this expensive waste of time. But would that doom me to see it again and again? Yikes!",2007

1,"The first pirates movie was the best one in my opinion, the third the worst, this movie was terrible, yes there were good action scenes and some nice special effects, but the plot was so bad that it makes the whole movie stink BIG TIME. I cant understand why some reviewers say this was a good movie, it had so many characters that it made it difficult to follow all of them, Keith Richards cameo was nothing special, he had a few lines, nothing funny or important, that was it, it seemed to me like every 20 minutes or so of the movie the plot took a different direction, rescue Jack, rescue Orlando's dad, get all the pirates together, free the witch, kill the British, make Jack immortal, save Orlando, kill Davey Jones etc...... the problem is not that they had so many objectives, the problem was that as a spectator, I could care less if they failed or succeeded.",2007
1,"The third movie in this series is truly a lazy effort from all involved. The story is mundane, unimaginative and basically a rehash of what we have already learned from 'Dead Man's Chest'.

Simply put I could watch a turd in a hat and get more enjoyment for nearly three irritating hours of absolute ...................., just take away the hat and you get what I mean! It was a rushed marketing job of a franchise that tried to rely on Depp, and it couldn't, as much as I think Johnny Depp is a legend, not even he can save this sinking ship!!!

What ever next, POTC 4: Revenge of the rock crabs - oh yes I didn't forget about you stupid little things - f'in rock crabs - please - a waste of CGI - I cant waste anymore time of this film - be gone to David Johnson's locker or whatever its called!!!",2007
7,"Less than a year after the previous installment of the popular pirates trilogy, Jack Sparrow and company return in Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End. The film should be great, given a three hundred million dollar budget, huge anticipation, and the closure a third installment inevitably brings to a series. While this film does show its budget and is quite visually arresting, it lacks a fair share of resolution to the trilogy and confuses with its overflowing exposition rather than purely existing to entertain.",2007
1,"Well, after seeing Pirates II, I didn't think it was possible for III to be any worse.... I was wrong. This is quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen. I understand that some movies are made just for ridiculous, but fun, action sequences and little or no plot line, and you can definitely tell which movies those are, but this one tried to have a decent plot, and failed miserably. Yes, the action sequences were fantastic and full of some of the most ridiculous stunts imaginable, but they in no way saved the horrible attempt at a plot line. With hardly any character development, far less Jack Sparrow than there should have been, the abandonment of the love triangle, the overly-dramatic attempt for an epic, and the complete lack of trying to be at least somewhat historically correct, the writers have caused cinema to reach a new low.",2007
1,"I came. I slept. I left. I wasted my time what a piece of garbage. The thing doesn't move at all, it lasts forever, scenes are overly drawn out and several of them are redundant. It took the film about an hour to establish some sort of premise otherwise it was just wasting its time with eye candy and gimmicks. The acting, including Johnny Depp who was great in the first film, was all flat and boring. The grotesque sea creates Davey Jones and his minions lost whatever appeal they had the feeling of repulsion separated from all other emotion isn't effective. The Black Pearl had at least some legs to stand on, however, wobbly. This series followed (or follows I shudder at the thought) a progression of getting progressively worse and longer. The first was good but too long by a half an hour, the second bad and too long by 45 minutes this one was god awful and shouldn't have started in the first place. Orlando Bloom's character doesn't really die which is a joke and I didn't care about anything that happened in it for a second. And the ending, or should I say endings, may be in fact worse than The Return of the King because at least those multiple endings were preceded by a great film. This one was barely watchable. I liked the first Pirates of the Caribbean a lot and felt, due in part by running time, that I wanted to see the story resolve itself though I really could care less. Now I wish I hadn't.",2007

I can't believe that somebody is ready to spend so much money but can't make a decent script or at least cogent story. The dialogs are stupid most of the time, monologues are idiotic (exept the monologues of Sparrow with himself) - especially the cry for battle and freedom of Keira at the end of the film: I felt sick... This kind of films destroy the film as an art, as something beautiful, something that can wheedle the emotions out of you, something that you'll think about and remember for a long time. This film is a product that need's to be sold. It is consumer oriented and could be rated with 10s only in consumer oriented society.",2007

8,"The more I think about this movie, the more I like it. This is strange, considering my low expectations. The first film was fun, and I was very happy to see swashbuckling returning to movies, but I never really bought into the script. I wasn't convinced that pirates were some sort of blood-bound ""race"", and I was powerfully confused by the distance between and physical relationships of various locations. But, still good fun. The second film just kind of made me mad; I loved the ending, but it was just one example of how much it was a standard sequel: every single quirk of the first film was referenced, every single character had to return, and it HAD to be structured - nay, plotted - like Empire Strikes Back. This included re-introducing the Han Solo-Leia love story where the female lead wants the anti-hero, just to appease all the screaming Johnny Depp fans. It begged to be liked, but aside from a great score, great effects, and some very funny moments, it just came off as trite.",2007

The awesome music is still in place, it's a bit faster paced than 2 (even with sections of dialogue in place), and the majority of characters get their come-uppance. There's heaps of sword fights and more cannons than I've seen in my life. The special effects are seamless and mix with great cinematography and top notch costumes & makeup. Many characters are more fully fleshed out, which was nice to see.",2007

So i went to the midnight showing of Pirates and accidentally fell asleep during the hour and a half of pointless content that is the first part of the movie. I went and saw it again and watched every minute and let me say, it was so bad and the plot line so choppy that once the movie was over i was unsure of the definitions of reality. Quite literally, i could have made a better movie with no camera. Jack Sparrow went insane, Elizabeth Swan learned to fight with the best of them, and suddenly the kraken, which was the basis of the second movie, got killed and ridden off in one line of dialogue. The writers of this movie should quit. and i don't mean just writing. i mean living. how do you screw up this movie? all you have to do is write a story about going to rescue jack without the driving over waterfalls, turning into crabs, or creating another movie's worth of plot about pieces of eight, which in the end got put in a bowl and burnt which made smoke that could have been drawn better with a dull rock. by the way, when you put magic into a movie, i don't want it explained. at all. just say what happened and ill catch up. because i know how people can be brought to life *cough cough* Barbosa *cough cough*.

And, guess what? The two that once seemed chunks of rankest Velveeta now blossomed like the sweetest of Edams next to ""Sunshine."" Call me old-fashioned, but I like films to be entertaining. I like them to have plots that progress with a semblance of logic. Oh, and I like films that have characters. With character. ""Event Horizon"" and ""Supernova"" at least take a shot at those criteria. ""Sunshine"" places itself above such silliness. Oh, Mr. Garland, what were you thinking...?

Mark Wahlbergs performance was top notch. Although there are a few ""no chance"" moments in the film as there always are with these type of films, the majority of it was for me within the realms of possibility.

The film was both engaging and entertaining, and Mark Wahlberg did a very good job of portraying the character in all of his idiosyncrasies. It was good to see Danny Glover again as I have not had the opportunity to see him in any films of late. His character was not exactly multidimensional but I would assume that it was what the writing called for, and certainly different from the one he portrays in the ""Lethal Weapon"" series, not much comedy here. Now if I could only get a hold of the script... Needless to say, my wife and I enjoyed the movie very much and would definitely recommend to go and see it.",2007
10,"I came into this film with loads of skepticism, but I came out feeling completely the opposite. Shooter takes you into the life of retired Marine Scout Sniper Bob Lee Swagger, who retired after a mission went completely wrong. He is called back to give information as to how someone would be able to kill the president from over a mile away. He ends up being framed for the attempted murder of the president, and the murder of an archbishop of Ethopia, and must prove his innocence, at any cost.",2007
10,"I was quite skeptical at watching the film, and didn't even get around to watching it until just last night(5/13/08), well over a year after it came out. What I saw was a pretty good political analysis as to what the major cover ups are and the cause of this Imperialist oil war.",2008
8,"Mark Wahlberg might be the Bruce Willis of the new generation. His taciturn Bobby Swagger is perfect. The action is basically nonstop and very gritty. Bobby is a sniper who has retired to the mountains after being screwed by the government in an event which finds his sidekick dead. After being set up, he is stone cold killer. Think Jason Bourne as someone who remembers his past is really p.o.'d about it. The acting is good all around, with Glover and Beatty as bad guys you love to hate. Underlying all this a morality tale about what this country and its government have become. Many situations, of course, stretch the imagination , but watching a sense of honor prevail, no matter how briefly, is worth the price of admission. No Oscar nominations here, but a big bundle of money for the producers will be no surprise.",2007
8,"I was surprised in many ways by shooter. #1, I was surprised by the release. I follow movies and I didn't hear about this title until early this year. #2, I was amazed by Marks ability to sell me on his acting skills. #3, By the fact that the most established actors in this title, Ned and Danny may have given career killing performances. I think Tony Todd and Stephen Root would have been solid choices, but my guess is the two poor performances were bought for name recognition.",2007
8,"Never mess with someone who can drop you with his gun from miles away. Snipers somehow has this aura of mystique and sexiness associated with the motto of ""one shot, one kill"", as exhibited in movies like Enemy at the Gates, or memorable war characters such as in Saving Private Ryan. In Shooter, this gets demystified for a while, hitting home that not only should one be gifted with the pulling of the trigger from incredible distance, a sniper is also a master mathematician, having to compute the trajectory of the round with factors of humidity, wind direction, angle etc just to hit the target.",2007
8,"Although not accurate all the way, this film is one of the more realistic action thrillers I've seen. It's one of the few films where the main character actually spends a lot of time taking care of just two gun shot wounds (without vital organs being hit), one of the few films that puts governmental corruption in a more or less correct perspective, one of the few films where the lone hero needs a sidekick to help him with the planning, etc. On top of that, the film is entertaining from beginning to end and character motives are believable.",2009
8,"It has always been one of the great mistakes of militaries around the world, to recruit the best young men and train them to kill ruthlessly. Some become so proficient at their task, as to glean the admiration of ambitious and callous individuals who will then use these human weapons for any purpose necessary. For the film student, this scenario is not new, but has become a repeatable staple for movie directors whenever they need intrigue, drama and action. The list of films who's name resembles, "" Marksman, Sniper, Assassin, Killer, Agent, Mercenary, Machanic, Sanction or just plain Liquidator."" is as long as your arm. The only difference here is the title has been shorten to ""Shooter."" In this story our hero, Bob Swagger (Mark Wahlberg) is an Ex-Iraq era Marine sniper, now retired and reputed to be the very best at his art is once again recruited to serve his country. A very sincere military Officer, Colonel Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover) convinces him to help protect the President of the United States. Convinced, Swagger details the 'where and how' to the Colonel and his men, only to discover, they are not what they appear and the Marine finds himself the target. On the run, he must now evade a nationwide manhunt, clear his name and find the truth behind the deception. Along the way, he discovers an ally in a rookie F.B.I. agent named Nick Memphis (Michael Peña) who also becomes a wanted fugitive. Based on the novel by Steven Hunter the fast action film includes notable Ned Beatty and Elias Koteas as Jack Payne. If you're looking for action, drama and a plausible movie for the times, you've found one. ****",2007
8,"finally, a movie in theaters WORTH seeing!!!! i just saw ""Shooter"" and i was thoroughly entertained. the plot kept me intrigued from beginning to end. mark wahlberg is fantastic... he's like a modern day McGuyver, but better looking and more sarcastic. his character is cunning and smart. wahlberg excels in playing characters who are determined to make an impact. i'm not a huge fan of action movies, but this movie was so packed with plot that i just kept moving along with it. i bet most of the naysayers of the film are going to be people who believe every word their government tells them. yes, this film depicts government officials in a bad light, but what or who doesn't? i'm sure in reality it's much worse. don't let political beliefs interfer with seeing this film... it's a good time no matter what side you are on. the screenplay was well-written, excluding ONE, minute one-liner about anna nicole smith marrying for love which was obviously written before her death. (plus the story takes place in 1997 anyway!!) other than that detail, viewers should have no complaints with this film. it's intense but not overbearing. easy to follow but complex. and you'll be impressed with wahlberg's character... go see for yourself!!",2007
4,"Shooter is the essence of a soulless movie bent on nothing more than pushing the horrific profession of a ""sniper"" onto the audience to illustrate just how incredible an assassin they make. You have an interesting plot line from the start, ""two snipers caught in a domestic and international war with no rules"", however the movie soon turns into a biased anti-government knockoff that is bent on showing conspiracies and crooked politicians.",2007
6,"Though little more than a strung-together collection of man-on-the-run, action movie clichés, ""Shooter"" provides a veritable feast for conspiracy-theory paranoiacs and a decent enough time at the movies for the rest of us.",2007
1,"*BEWARE OF SPOILERS* _ _ I had the misfortune to see this with my brother, and had to fight the overwhelming urge to just cut and run like the commanders did on Bob Lee in the beginning of this film... or like Mark's sense apparently did when he took the role. From horrible scripting to absurd situations and a gaggle of gratuitous explosions, this film tanked from the beginning. I was misled to think that this was a film setting of the book ""The Shooter"" but in fact, it wasn't, it so very much was not. The first thing I laughed at (that wasn't part of the AMAZING wit built into the script) was this amazingly pointless scene of at least 30 seconds of watching Marky Mark put on sunglasses and stroll away in slow motion from an equally pointless interchange with Danny Glover. Apparently Antoine Fuqua has a little fetish for the way Mr Wahlberg walks... Also, what is up with Danny Glovers mouth, it sounded like he had braces or throat cancer, or both, all he could manage was this whispering, cotton-mouthed mumbling, weird! But from there we get things like that the bad-guy fat-ass cop that is the first guy to run after and catch up to Gunny(jeeez!!), a veteran scout sniper , followed by scenes involving no less than 15 black helicopters swarming over Philadelphia, 2 obnoxious 'field medic' type scenes, a really super car chase, random nipple shots from one of the two 'babes', more bullets, techno-babble, and squibs than I can count, an evil Russian in a wheelchair, and then some more scenes with helicopters... the list goes on and on. All this culminates in about three different endings and a final scene with all the bad guys drinking cocktails and laughing evilly at the sheer magnitude of their malevolence... The story was shallow and aimless, the script was pitiful, the acting was sub-par (except Pena, kudos on not being as crappy) And worst of all, it took itself seriously. The only thing this movie was missing was Joe Don Baker, but, hey, at least we had Ned Beatty. As Nick Memphis so accurately put it 'This is Ridiculous!'",2007
2,"When you have crafted films in the same vein there is simply no reason to allow huge gaffs to appear. The Bourne series so far has the 'violent hero struggling to survive in a web of intrigue and deception' covered without the glaring mistakes that make The Shooter an embarrassment to watch. Gunshot wounds and torture wounds that disappear; an inability to remember a simple license plate number without resorting to a mobile phone camera, a self-healing process utterly devoid of any medical basis whatsoever and-laughably- apparently the requirement to include the Coriolis effect in a sniper's calculations. ""Sure I'll sign up for anything without even needing to see ID or do some background checks"". I appreciate the editor probably had their work cut out for them dealing with this rubbish but the continuity was shockingly bad. And as for the ending? Utter garbage. Marky running around in a ridiculous white chicken suit was the highlight. If the director added a couple of ""L""s to his surname it would make more sense.",2007
5,"Shooter is a movie where Stuff Gits Blowed Up Real Good. If you're in the mood for a b-grade action flick where stuff gits blowed up and the cartoon character bad guys git their heads blowed off, this one is passable. You could find a better mindless action flick, but this one will do in a pinch.",2007

10,"(My Synopsis) Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg), a former Marine scout sniper who had the ability to hit a target from a mile away, leaves the Corps after a mission goes terribly wrong. Swagger has become a cynical American Marine who believes that he was betrayed by his country. What Swagger didn't know was that he was on a secret mission working for a black-ops government organization with their own agenda about what America really needs. Swagger is contacted by retired Colonel Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover), who tells him that his country needs his special knowledge and expert skills as a sniper to stop an assassination attempt on the President. Swagger doesn't want to work for these guys,but his patriotism for his country makes him do it. Unfortunately, for Swagger this is the same black-ops group that left him for dead before. And as usual, they set him up and double-cross him again. Now the whole country thinks he was the one who tried to kill the President. To prove his innocence, Swagger must find these people and learn the truth and take out his own revenge. ",2007
7,"Shooter opens with Swagger (Wahlberg) in the middle of a failing black-op in Ethiopia. His spotter is killed, and he's left for dead by the agency that sent him in, leaving him to somehow escape the situation on his own. Cut to 3 years later, and Marky Mark is set up in a ranch in the snowy mountains in a remote location, sporting an awful haircut, and owning perhaps the best dog in the world. His reclusive existence is interrupted by Colonel Johnson (Glover), who arrives with a mysterious offer that he just can't refuse...",2007
2,"I knew nothing of this film in advance other than it starred Mark Wahlberg. I was surprised how good it started out and set in Philadelphia, too!!! Although the action was violent and graphic, it had an energy and flow that was mesmerizing. This was going to be a good night. This film would be special and as good as the Bourne movies. The characters were developed well, Wahlberg's unique style and quirkiness was coming through, perhaps the next Bruce Willis. I cared about these characters. The quality of the filming was top notch, the angles excellent, often the film was vivid. The story was humming along, an assassination conspiracy slowly developing and unraveling. Then just beyond the half way point the movie crashed. BANG. The plot line made little sense, a tiresome anti-American film. Ho Hum. Over acting and over reaching by Ned Beatty and Danny Glover. Beatty a cartoon character, and Glover so over the top and implausible in any position of authority my head started to throb. What did they do? They ruined a film with such promise and destroyed it with a half baked story line that just appeared to take shots at the government. Where was the press? Want country are we in? The FBI is the Keystone Kops? Death to any intrigue. All believability gone.......a night ruined. A shame too, and almost criminal, because it had such a strong start, such a solid feel to it. To be reduced to the keystone cops with evil men so shallow no one could take them seriously. Oh, there may indeed be evil men in our government, but Glover's character would not have lasted one week. I love Ned Beatty, I hate his performance. If he wants to do a caricature of a powerful clandestine operative, then do a sequel to Hopscotch and make it a comedy. And the final scene was so dreadful, so implausible, that is was the perfect ending to this miserable failure of a film.",2007
5,"THE GOOD - What a great start! The first half hour of this is outstanding and the first hour very good. It looks like, as advertised, that if you enjoyed the ""Bourne"" movies (""The Bourne Identity"" and ""The Bourne Supremacy"") you should like this and that was the case with me.....for the first hour. Mark Walhber's ""Bob Lee Swagger"" is a likable hero, a good guy in every sense. Yes, he's macho, intelligent, a thoughtful, patriotic guy, etc.. The scenes where he is eluding everyone in Philadelphia in what would be an impossible dragnet lack a little credibility but they sure are fun to watch.",2007
4,"Shooter comes over as a slick, exciting action movie, Mark Wahlberg gives a strong if largely emotionless performance and Danny Glover is suitably menacing, with Elias Coteas playing his trademark man-on-the-edge-of-sanity. Ned Beatty is deliciously evil as the morally bankrupt man in high place and Michael Pena steals numerous scenes as the unassuming but determined FBI agent. The female roles are, as with so many action films, cardboard cut-outs. The problems start when you break the film down and realise that the message is that shooting people solves the problem, which is, of course, a contemptible message to be peddling. It's too late to rescue America's soul, but the rest of us are hopefully not beyond saving - however movies like this do not help.",2014
3,"Standard issue action flick. Huge government conspiracy: check. Fireballs in the background frame the protagonist as he walks away without turning around: check. Slimy, over-acting henchmen: check. Crooked senator: check. Gigantic plot holes that move you to the next shootout: check.",2007
1,There is not one part of the Shooter you haven't seen before and done considerably better. It borrows so liberally from past espionage action movies that it sometimes feels as if you've seen this film before.,2007
1,"What can I say. A patriot who know how to kill people, a nice girl with big breast(a soon to be hostage), conspiracy..... This movie just tells me the fact that Hollywood has some serious problems with telling good stories. Everything in this movie is presented to me like if I was an idiot. But I am because I watch it.. The problem with Hollywood is that the can't release them self from the formula. The formula is of course what people want. This movie is a TYPICAL example of that. It's so full of clichés that I don't know where to begin. In the beginning of the movie you will see a scene when the main character is living alone in the wild(Rambo in Canada?). The Hollywood directors really want you to get this so they dresses him i redneck clothes drinking beer(with his dog) and a lot of mountains. And when the girl with the breasts start acting nurse later on I realize(in despair) that I already seen half of the movie and I cant turn back. They could not even let the bad guys be killed by someone else than the main character. These days I rather check out HBO or the Asian movies to get amused. This really sucks. Please, don't waste your time. Jens Alenius",2007
4,I rarely post things on internet blogs but this is a bit of a concern of mine. I am worried that beautiful films such as L'Infant are going to now be classified in the same category as Juno. I understand the mass appeal of this movie-- the mainstream audience being confused and thinking it's an indie flick by the gritty film used and the obscure references but Juno is in no way an independent film. I think why it is so ineffective is because the audience it was trying to attract (the movie fanatics who hate big budget Hollywood junk i.e. anything with Jessica alba in it) saw it for what it really was: Hollywood junk wrapped up in a converse shoelace bow. It was as indie as Avril is punk rock.,2008
2,"What is it about any movie that shows a hip white woman bringing her baby to term that causes film critics to temporarily lose their minds? ""Knocked Up"" was given a free pass and Juno is inspiring some of the worst film criticism I've ever seen.",2008
1,"Realize this movie was hyped to the wazoo for being wacky and offbeat. Actually, it's just garbage. The dialogue absolutely RUINS this movie. I realize it's a movie and is not necessarily expected to be realistic but it is so far from reality (and not in a good way) that it's just annoying. The character of Juno occasionally resembles a realistic teenager but most of the time is just a caricature of some type of person I have never seen or heard of in real life. The soundtrack blows. The whole movie is some pretentious attempt to be cool and artsy and instead just comes across as really silly.",2008
1,This movie is way over-hyped. Most of the time I was just annoyed by most of the things on the screen.,2008
1,"This is not a typical film review; there are plenty of those around here. This is more like an observation, after seeing Juno. It won't serve as well unless you have already seen the movie.",2009
7,"""Juno"" is funny (nearly every single line of dialogue is written to elicit laughter), directed with at just as sure a hand as ""Thank You For Smoking"".. possibly surer.. and acted gamely by the whole cast -- especially Olvia Thirlby and J.K. Simmons as the title character's galpal and understanding dad. The script, by Diablo Cody, is rich with one-liners; anyone who's read Candy Girl (which is unbelievably intelligent and funny; her description of Shania Twain, especially, had me rolling) will kind of know what to expect.",2007
6,"At first blush, ""Juno"" seems like a pretty great movie. It's entertaining and lots of fun to watch. There's a great cast, and each of the film's characters are well-sketched and interesting. First-rate cinematography keeps the film colorful and engaging from start to finish. There are more than enough quirks, witty dialogues and obscure name-droppings to keep the hipsters placated. Perhaps it's just a bit pretentious and tries just a bit too hard, but these flaws could be overlooked. The movie should have been a charming little indie-lite film.",2008
7,"This could have been a very, very good film. I enjoyed the basic plot - a quirky, tomboy-ish 16 year old discovers she's pregnant, decides to give the baby up for adoption to the ""perfect couple"" but finds that the perfect couple isn't so perfect - and maybe no relationship ever is.",2009
3,"I must be the only person who can honestly say I didn't crack a smile once throughout the entire movie. It was hard for me to smile because I was busy being irritated at the horrible dialogue and annoying ""jokes"" spewed out by Juno and her stupid friends. Perhaps the worst part of all was the irritating and unnecessary indie ""girl with a guitar"" music constantly fading in and out throughout the movie.",2008
3,"The sixteen year old pregnant girl is played brilliantly by Ellen. She is depicted as a confident and autonomous young person making extremely important life decisions. She does this without any discernible guidance, except for the disproportionate weight she places on a placard-bearing peer, who advises her that her unborn already has fingernails. Hence, she abandons her original and previously unchallenged plan of abortion, in favour of finding some infertile yuppie adopters to be recipients of a free baby.",2008
9,I saw this movie at a preview in St. Louis about ten days ago and can't stop thinking about it.,2007
10,"Juno has an effect on you. You can tell by the opening title sequence that this movie has a lot of heart. The unique dialogue may come off as annoying to some but I find it to be one of the reasons the characters feel so real and likable. I felt as if Juno was a real person throughout the whole film, thanks to Ellen page. Her performance is perfect and there could not have been a better pick for the lead role. All of the casting choices are great. Including J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney as Juno's Parents. Jason Reitman did his best directing in his career by far on this film, in my opinion of coarse. Diablo Cody's perfect script would have been ruined by any other director. But Reitman has an amazing control of tone. On a personal level Juno has left an impression on me and I will truly never forget it.",2013
3,"This weekend, my girlfriend drove down from Purdue visit me here at good old IU (she's transferring next year, thank God). Apparently, Purdue has some school-sanctioned P2P video sharing software that she recently got hold of. At a friend's suggestion, she downloaded Juno, and wanted to watch it with me. I personally thought the movie was a little too ""chick-flicky"" for me, but I absolutely LOVED Superbad (proud owner of the DVD, t-shirt, and theatrical poster), so I thought ""What the hell, it has Michael Cera, and it'll make my girl happy."" After watching the movie, I felt the need to watch Superbad again and make sure the same actor that was hysterical in that movie could possibly be the bland, unfunny male ""lead"" in Juno. Thankfully, I wasn't alone. My girlfriend shared my sentiments as well, so i didn't feel like a total a-hole.",2008
5,"Not funny! Don't waste your time and money! If you've seen the previews, you've seen the funniest stuff in the movie (and by the time you hit the movie, those aren't even funny anymore though evidently some of the people in our theater thought they still were)! Overall, our theater was pretty quiet!",2008
5,"I went into this movie with very high expectations as several friends had recommended it to me and it has an 8.4 rating on IMDb. Those expectations were not up to par with the movie itself, to say the least. You can cite various stylistic problems and inconsistencies in the story, but ultimately none of that matters. I just found it to be pointless. There isn't anything fatally wrong with the story or with the actors, it's just that I don't see what the interest is to begin with.",2008
1,"How original. A teenage girl who has the ""old soul"" vibe to her and for no explained reason has knowledge of '77 Punk though she was born in the '90's and her dimwitted blonde friend sure doesn't know who Richard Hell would be. This movie is almost a slap in the face to anyone who has a good set of morals. Her ""only"" options are to go to an abortion clinic or give the baby up to spoiled yuppies? The basically uninformed and shy Michael cera has basically no say in anything until all her options run out and then she ""decides"" that they must have been in love all along. And the comments she makes while getting her ultrasound are borderline offensive and her mom had no right to stick up for her daughters constantly talking and babbling mouth. The fact that ANY teenager would actually act and talk like Juno is a farce. She even keeps stopping by the adopters house unannounced and basically hitting (or flirting) with Jason Bateman who is supposed to be adopting this baby! And OF COURSE the parents are not only supportive but have plenty of wacky looks and one-liners themselves. The soundtrack is even worse then the crappy dialogue in this movie. I left this movie feeling insulted and the lack of 'moral' to this story is ????? That you try two different ways to ditch your own kid (who she always refers to as ""it"") and when nothing works you go to the original father and say ""lucky you""! Even the sex that took place was non-emotional and scary to think that high schoolers would just do it so casually like that. And why are people putting associating the word ""indie"" w/ this movie? It has major stars in it and looks pro. If I could of ripped my head from my body and thrown it at the screen in order to get this movie to stop I would have. Ellen Page deserves cut-out bargain bin for this movie not any awards. Her performance was of utter annoyance. Maybe the ""american pie"" movie crowd likes this but if you are a true lover of film....skip it!",2008
2,"We've all done it. We've had that little moment where we think we're clever. We will jot down a poem, a short story or maybe even direct a super poignant student film and try to amaze everyone with our talents. After blowing smoke up our own butts for a while, most of us come back to earth fairly easily. Sometimes, we'll look back on these moments years later and say, ""Ah. My youth. How foolish I was back then.."" and enjoy a bit of nostalgia. Juno is what happens when that moment festers long enough to make it to the big screen.",2008
1,"Having been recommended this movie by quite a few people, I had fairly lofty expectations for this movie. Boy was I highly disappointed. This movie was really boring, especially towards the end where I was practically falling asleep, and this wasn't due to a lack of sleep!

6,"While I would admit that there were definitely a few laugh-out-loud moments in Diablo Cody's dialogue, there were a lot of inconsistencies with her characters. Is Juno being portrayed as a ""wise beyond her years"" 16 year-old, or are we supposed to understand that she is just your typical teen who acts on impulse without forethought of the consequences? She seems mature when she is faced with a very difficult situation (Mark coming on to her), and she handles it with ethics and aplomb. Yet somehow, she is so naïve that she never saw it coming in the first place (despite the warnings of her step-Mom). Heck, if she's smart enough to figure out how to deal calmly with this accidental pregnancy, why on earth didn't she use protection with Paulie in the first place? If she's supposed to be just a regular teen, then why have all the hip-quips and precocious attitude? And is it just me, or is it hard to see why Vanessa and Mark Loring are even still together when we first meet them? They couldn't be more different than Felix and Oscar, and yet The Odd Couple was entertaining because it was about comedy and conflict. The slow demise of a marriage is sadly real, but not entertaining.",2007
8,"Anybody who gets to see the promos or the DVD covers would have enough clue about what the movie is about.Well I can tell you this,its not only the story which was brilliant - Its the wonderfully written screenplay,great acting by the casts,captivating photography with great locations and of course Ellen Page's incredible acting which has made a mark. There is generally a specific group of audience who could appreciate a certain movie,but when it gets to Juno...anybody above the ""PG13"" audience will definitely love it.The movie is about emotions,friends,innocence,parenthood,commitment and of course the fun in living it up! I enjoyed watching the movie over a Sunday afternoon at home,I just fell in love with it :)",2011
3,"I will admit right up front, OK so the dialogue was clever, the acting was interesting the main character was sassy but with the emotional range of a turnip. I DID NOT like this film. Why I hear you ask. The truth? Its an over-rated phoney! A smart, clever, sassy know it all, 16 year old teenager but without the sense to practice safe sex, gets pregnant has baby, decides to go for abortion but changes mind at last minute, offers the baby up for adoption, everyone lives happily ever after. Come on!!! Am I living on a different planet to everyone else? What is entertaining about that? You call that an original story? You see hundreds of made for TV movies with the same story.",2008
8,"The thing that separates ""Juno"" from so many other films about teen pregnancy is that, in this case, the 16-year-old who finds herself in that predicament refuses to become a victim of her circumstances. From the moment she confirms the unwelcome news, Juno studies her options - abortion, raising the child as a single teen parent, adoption - then takes matters into her own hands. Like the Roman goddess who is her namesake, Juno is a bright, often sharp-tongued individual who prides herself on her observant cynicism and her way with a sarcastic quip. However, she's not above appealing to the adults in her life when the problems of the world get to be too much for her (though, in some cases, the grownups are coping with more serious issues than she is). Yet, Juno makes certain that it is she and she alone who will have the final say when it comes to determining the course of her own future and that of her child.",2008
9,"I'm a teenage boy, and the reviews for ""Enchanted,"" along with some friendly persuasion from my sisters, moved me to give this live action/animated combo. a chance. In the first fourteen minutes of Enchanted, there were two things that caught my attention: 1)The never-ending, sugar-coated, sing-along tune and 2) The grainy style of animation that Disney lavished upon the screen(a tribute to the Disney classics, such as Beauty and the Beast and Sleeping Beauty); in this time span, I felt truly embarrassed to be sitting in the theater with the older couples clustered around me. I mean, what kind of boy in his right mind would want to watch a movie with musical numbers and pretty princesses? And yet, there was something about it...the aire of it almost took me back to the days of my childhood when I would smash my face up to the T.V. screen, when Belle and the Beast were having their unforgettable ball dance or when Ariel was brushing her hair with a fork. It was these sorts of memories that surfaced to my mind as I kept watching Enchanted. And it kept getting better and better. When there was a sudden switch to live-action, my heart was captured by Amy Adams, who seems to be, in my opinion, the finest choice for Giselle. Prince Edward and Robert also had their perfect fits (James Marsden and Patrick Dempsey). Even though this movie is close to perfect, it still has its problems. There is an aire of predictability in the storyline, as well as the fact that it's swamped with clichés (some of which are fresh, and some of which are flat). Yet it flows on, innocently, with its strong actors/actresses, decent-enough screenplay that gives you a warm feeling in your heart (which is what Disney is supposed to do, right?), spectacular music numbers that have charm, and the fact that it is suitable for all ages. There is a little something for everyone in this film--and it's not just a film either--it is a time-machine back to the golden era of Disney's animated films, and its live-action ones as well. And it helps me look forward to the new Disney: one that keeps surprising me more and more every single day.",2007
8,"Combining elements of modern day Manhattan with romanticized fairy tale settings, ""Enchanted"" tells the story of Giselle (Adams), your typical Disney leading lady living in a cottage, singing with innocent creatures, awaiting the day she would meet her prince charming.

This movie is very cute and quite good at being both wholesome for the kiddies and tongue-in-cheek for the adults. You need to appreciate a studio being able to poke fun at itself. By using the classic stories of Cinderella, Snow White, and Sleeping Beauty, all made famous in their own right by the Mouse House, we are given some big laughs. The acting is very self-referential and broad as far as the fairy tale roles that make the journey into our world's New York City go. Screenwriter Bill Kelly gives the cast some great lines and set pieces to play in, ultimately showing us that the storybooks aren't always right. True love does exist, but not necessarily with the one you first think. The message is good, the songs are good, the animation and acting are goodDisney came through with this one. Along with Meet the Robinsons, Mickey and friends may be turning the ship around into a new renaissance.",2007
10,"I first saw the trailer for Enchanted in the spring, from the moment it ended, I knew this was a movie that I wanted to see. I finally saw it today and it's everything that I hoped for and more. It was nice to finally see a Disney movie that wasn't computer animated, the beginning was almost a forgotten memory of the old fashion animation that I miss so much. But Enchanted is without a doubt one of the most fun films of the year and so perfect for the whole family. I though the plot was so extremely clever, what if the cartoons with the fairytale stories met into today's world? Especially in New York City? The cast just looked like they had the ultimate blast making this movie and really brought it to life. They each held their own and were a perfect choice for the comedic role they had to play. Enchanted is a clever twist on the classic fairy tale.",2007
10,"I had recently seen a screening of this movie and was pleasantly surprised that it had completely exceeded my expectations. The theater was full of laughs from the beginning throughout all ages. In the beginning I was worried that Amy Adams would make Giselle seem like some obnoxious daytime children's television character, but instead she managed to please the audience during the entire movie. There was also enough humor to keep the older viewers entertained from hilarious allusions to popular fairy tales and even some ""adult"" themes insinuated, while still keeping the film Disney clean. Overall I completely enjoyed this movie and recommend it to all families.",2007
9,"I went to see Enchanted at the premiere on 20/10/2007 and I was really pleasantly surprised. I had expected all the usual Disney trademarks to be included; singing, animation, animals that talk, a prince and an evil stepmother, all these was there but also so much more! I was not expecting the film to be as funny as it was; it's packed with jokes; quite a few were aimed at adults, so went over the children's heads, but the weren't rude or distasteful enough to offend the children. This film is an 'all rounder'; it contains all the Disney elements that children and adults love, but also enough to humour to make it an enjoyable comedy for the adults.",2007
10,"The movie is quite simply, the best Family movie in the past few years. From the beginning, the movie sucks you in with narration from a Disney Legend. You fall in love with the characters right away and it's quite simply a return to the greatness that Disney can deliver. The cast led by Amy Adams, Patrick Dempsey, James Marsden and Timothy Spall (Wormtail from the Harry Potter movies who gives an inspired Oscar-worthy performance) is impeccable. Rounding out the cast is Susan Sarandon who is part Evil Queen, part Maleficent and pure EVIL and the adorable Rachel Covey who is the perfect ""mini-princess"" for Giselle to play off of. The music by Stephen Schwartz and Alan Menken (in a return to brilliance) is terrific. The original songs are the best to come out of Disney since The Hunchback of Notre Dame. The story, quite simply is part fish-out-of-water, part romantic comedy, part animated and all fun. The live-action portion of the movie feels like your watching animation. The way that Giselle infects those around her with her innocent ""Princess-esque"" demeanor is really at the heart of what makes the movie so great. Of course, it wouldn't be Disney without a few scene-stealing animals who don't take over the movie and really are what they are meant to be, supporting characters. There are a few nods to the past as well. I won't share them here, but let's just say they are subtle enough not to be distracting, but still there enough to bring a smile to your face. The violence in the movie is nothing more than what you would see in any other PG family movie, and really aside from being live-action, isn't anything you wouldn't see in movies such as Sleeping Beauty or Snow White.",2007
9,"First off, I want to say that, there is a comment on this thread where someone calls Enchanted disturbing, should be rated R, etc. It is obvious she did not see the film. This reviewer is high, and, this review should be removed.",2007
10,"My husband and I received tickets to this movie as a gift. My husband was just going to take our daughter, but we decided to all go. We took my 11 year old son and my 10 year old daughter to this movie thinking it would just be something to do since ""we had the tickets anyway."" It was supposed to just be a fun night. We had no idea how ""in love"" with this movie we would all be! We laughed out loud, I cried, and the kids had the best time. We were actually holding hands and singing on the way back to the car. It's a must see! Dads, you'll laugh, I promise! We can't wait until it comes out on video! It's Great family time. Go go GO see this movie.",2007
8,"This is really the definition of ""light entertainment,"" and seriously, I am still smiling about it now. After getting in the way of an Evil Queen, a fairytale princess is cast into an alternate reality--the real world as we know it--and must survive there until her rescue by her Prince Charming. Hmm! From the trailer I saw, my guess was that ""Enchanted"" was a one-joke show, a series of gags about how fairytale magic falls on its face in the real world. That Disney has managed to squeeze at least four or five good jokes out of the idea, and mixed in a few sprinkles of profundity on top of that, is something of an achievement. As a romp, it works fairly well, and it delivered quite a lot more than I was expecting. ",2007
8,"I was lucky enough to see a preview of ""Enchanted"" yesterday, and I am really glad I went. The big appeal in this movie is , I think, the fact that Disney seems to be making fun of itself. From the one-day romances, to the spontaneous singing, this Disney movie delivers all of the classic plot lines but with a humorous and decidedly fresh panache. Amy Adams makes a sweet princess, and James Marsden plays Prince Charming (or Prince Edward in this case) as an innocent and ditsy hero. Susan Sarandon is witty as the evil witch, and Timothy Spall makes an endearing henchman. Patrick Dempsey makes for a great anti-hero. But in my opinion, Pip the squirrel was the most hilarious character, especially when communicating Spalls true intent to the oblivious Prince Edward. From the musical numbers to the CGI, this movie is definitely worth watching with the whole family.",2007
8,"I just got home from an advanced screening at my local theater, and all I can say is WOW! I must admit, when I first came into the movie theater, I was quite skeptical as to how good it would be, considering it's a modern Disney movie and all, but boy was I wrong. This was one of the best family oriented films I have seen in years. The entire theater applauded with vigor at the end of the movie. Truly an essential family movie-going experience.",2007
10,"so lovely! this is a film for singles looking for love, for kids, just an all around adorable film--so different and so inventive! LOVED it. (not to mention the cutest chipmunk scene you've ever seen!) everyone who walked out of the screening was smiling. it's so rare to find films that are really well put together script-wise, and this is definitely one of them. u might even want to see it more than once--it's that good. i literally fell in love with this film. Amy Adams is a delight--I was pleasantly shocked to see there are a few comments below that suggest her role is Oscar worthy, but really. her performance is that good. And who doesn't like two hours with Mr. McDreamy?!",2007
9,"First of all, I'm going to tell you that I'm a 16 year old girl, so this review may be a little biased in your opinion. For the most part, the reviews for Enchanted have been stellar. I enjoyed reading them, and agreed with most of them, until I got to the end where a few wet blankets decided to ruin the rave reviews. They think there's too much marketing, the marriage/divorce issues aren't appropriate..the list goes on.",2007
7,"'Enchanted' looks like a movie that a guy would never be seen at. C'mon, it's another Disney princess, and just looks pretty girly, right? Well, this is true.

10,"I'm not in this movie's target demographic. I'm a guy aged 24-30. Yet the preview sucked me in, and I'm glad I did. Why? It's a movie that tells us a little about ourselves, and makes fun of how we distinguish fantasy from reality and why we hold onto our dreams.",2007
9,"I was invited to see this film with my girlfriend, her parents and her little sister. Her dad and I where hesitant about seeing this film as we where both under the impression it was going to be a girlie flick or just another kids film. We where wrong! I don't think I laughed as much the first time I saw Jack Dee live as I did with this film! I think the very few blokes in the audience where actually laughing more than the women who wanted to see the film in the first place! Genius. This Movie caught me completely off guard! For the few blokes who are willing to put there masculinity to one side for an hour and 30 minutes, get some mates round; rent this movie and you will all be crying with laughter by the end.",2008
9,"Enchanted, Disney cartoon meets New York City a fantastic combination making this a 'laugh for all the family' film. This seemed to me as a classic Disney film modernised in a tasteful way. With such a good plot and characters I found myself completely absorbed into the film and was not disappointed as it held enough singing, dancing, romance and glitter to keep me happy and remind me of what a fantastic Disney creation I was watching. Starting in a typical fairytale cartoon immediately the plot became the usual true love tale until Giselle enters the real world of New Nork City she discovers and realises new ideas and emotions which change her mind about her true love. Amy Adams proved a great performance as 'Princess Gabrielle' as did James Marsden and Susan Sarandon as Prince Edward and the evil stepmother Narcissa. A* production.",2007
8,"I was thoroughly surprised to find myself completely hooked on and enjoying this silly movie. There is nothing dazzling about it, and it is far from perfect, but it had me laughing at and caring for each of the characters. It was able to strike a notes of both comedy and sympathy while blatantly making fun of itself and every other fairy tale story. The idea of setting it in New York made it all the more enjoyable. Definitely give it a try, this isn't Oscar material, or even Disney's best, but at least you'll be smiling by the end.",2007
8,"I'll make this quick as Enchanted has already been discussed to death on IMDb. And quite honestly, I've got nothing much new to add. But I did want to post a comment and add my voice to those praising this movie. I am absolute stunned at how much I enjoyed Enchanted. It's just that  enchanting. And it may be the best thing Disney (without Pixar) has done in years. I love the way Disney uses Enchanted to poke fun at itself  something that quite honestly I didn't thing they would ever do. The song in the park is an incredibly inspired moment that works on two levels  one as an entertaining throw back to a time when musicals were acceptable forms of entertainment  and two as a spoof of all of those musicals. Finally, the casting couldn't have been better. I didn't know who Amy Adams was before I watched Enchanted, but she is awesome and plays the part of a Disney princess to perfection. It's just a fantastic movie!",2008

When Edward meets the dreamer Giselle, they immediately fall in love with each other and decide to get married on the next day. However, Narissa disguises in an old witch and lures Giselle, pushing her down in a magic wishing well that brings Giselle (Amy Adams) to the real world in Times Square in Manhattan. Giselle does not find anyone gentle and is completely lost in the cold and rainy New York trying to find the way back to Andalasia. However, the divorce lawyer Robert Philip (Patrick Dempsey) and his daughter Morgan Philip (Rachel Covey) help Giselle and she spends the night in their apartment. Meanwhile Prince Edward (James Marsden) and his squirrel Pip jumps in the well and arrives in Times Square seeking out Giselle. But Queen Narissa sends his minion Nathaniel (Timothy Spall) yo New York with a poisoned apple to kill Giselle. Robert, who is engaged of Nancy (Idina Menzel), becomes fascinated with the naive and lovely Giselle that falls in love with him. But her prince charming is in the real world to bring Giselle back to Andalasia.",2010
10,I went into this movie not knowing what to expect. I read the plot and was a bit intrigued as to how they were going to pull it off. Of course Disney always has a way of bringing charm and smiles to the big screen and this time was definitely no exception either.,2007
10,"Let me first preface that I have a predisposition for enjoying Disney animated films. I'm not sure if its the child in me, or the fairy-tale stories, or what; but for whatever reason, I have a rather large soft spot for them. Enchanted is no different and has not swayed me from my position a bit. It left me wanting so much more. At first I was concerned with how the transition from animation to live action would really look like on screen, but my fears soon faded away the first time I saw Amy Adams pop out of a sewer in a giant wedding dress. How marvelous and enchanting she truly is, I thought; and how animated! How absolutely animated she is! It's really as if the cartoon has come to life--as if the New York City backdrop is just that, a fabricated, foreign backdrop. And then she started talking... And her voice, her facial expressions, everything: completely animated. After the film, David and Yen told me I absolutely had to see Junebug, and I certainly will after this performance. She shined the entire time on screen and she sold me. I actually believed she was really from some fairy-tale, animated world where dreams come true and everyone lives happily ever after. I loved her so much, I'm not even going to mention the other performances other than to say they were adequate and took nothing away from the film. I'll also note that the Central Park musical number is to die for.",2007
6,"His Dark Materials: Northern Lights, the original name for the book, in the UK. What a poignant, mysterious title for a book. The Golden Compass? Well, it doesn't quite have the same impact, does it? The use of the American name of the book for the film really didn't bother me at first, but as early warning signs come, it doesn't get much more obvious than this; we should have guessed from the off that this was going to be a very different beast to the book.",2007
7,"The Golden Compass in my eyes was the must see film of this Christmas. I am a huge fan of the His Dark Materials books, and was reading all three in preparation for the movie to come, I was praying this would be the new fantasy epic to watch. I suppose I got myself way too hyped for this movie, even the slightly negative reviews didn't stop me from being excited, so what a shame to say this cannot help but be a disappointment for me. I have a few major problems with this mainly, mainly I suppose because of the changes from the book, in fact had I have not read the book I most probably would have completely adored the movie rather than have just liked it. The Golden Compass is not a bad movie, its definitely better than the first Narnia movie and Harry Potter movie, but after reading the book I couldn't help but criticise because I know how amazing this movie could have been. Thankfuly the entire cast, yes the entire cast, are absolutely perfect, there are two notable set pieces and the storyline still keeps its grip on the audience despite being rushed. The lack of the ending from the book actually didn't even bother me that much, so long as people who have read the book are aware its going to be in the second movie then I believe that they won't be that bothered. Overall Golden Compass is an entertaining two hours, that could benefit from another half hour. Its a great film to watch for Christmas and will hopefully do well at the box office so the Subtle Knife is made very soon.",2007
2,"The opening scene was the very first clue that this film was going to be the barrage of formula drudgery that it ultimately turned out to be. Weitz began by unveiling all the information which the reader isn't even aware of by the end of the first novel in a horrific attempt to follow the footsteps of The Lord of the Rings with an opening prelude. Much of the intrigue of Pullman's storytelling is derived from the careful progression of revealed information, letting the reader know only as much as it needs to at any moment, and no more. The mystery is not only lost, it is purposely banished by the blundering slate of exposition which begins with the prologue and carrys on through the film's duration. Every bit of exposition has the feel of a technical bother that must be gotten out of the way so that the action scenes can make some kind of sense. But the real kicker is the obviousness. The obviousness ranging from New Line's less than subtle attempt to repeat a miracle (LOTR), to the individual lines in the film (""Why am I here? What do they want? What is she going to do with me?""), and everything in between. Show, don't tell, is the first rule of third grade story writing, a class these film makers clearly missed. ",2007
1,"I'm an incredibly big fan of the trilogy ""His Dark Materials"" and I can safely say that if you are too, you will want stay away from this movie. While it essentially follows the general plot of the book, it has captured nothing of the original magic of the books and has changed a ridiculous amount for no apparent reason. I can understand missing bits out due to time restrictions, but the movie has completely ripped the book up and then sellotaped it together in a mix mash of the original plot. Not only that but it is incredibly dumbed down, probably to suit the audience.",2008
1,"Having already read Pullman's Dark materials trilogy, I was understandably excited to hear that Northern Lights was being made into a film., however, I think should have been more suspicious about it being renamed ""The Golden Compass"". Despite that I still went to see it and I can't remember that last time I have been more disappointed by a film.",2007
4,"I have not read the book so I can't comment on how close the movie follows it. However, as a movie, it is so poorly edited to be barely comprehensible. The whole movie seems like every other scene has been cut out. Characters and situations are not explained, relationships are not developed, and the plot is left with gaping holes. Fans of the book will, no doubt, be able to fill in the details. For the rest of us, I would not bother. This is a shame because the acting is good and well-cast. The special effects are equally impressive. If the movie had lasted another hour, it probably would have been terrific. Hopefully, a director's cut will be released some day that redeems this travesty.",2007

9,"I went into this film fearing the worst. I had become concerned over the past months as it became increasingly clear that the film was at great risk of losing direction, the vision if you will, that had drawn readers to the books series in the first place. That it was doomed. I feared this strange kind of anti-Narnia, was likely being so diluted that BO disaster was certain. That may still be the case if the bulk of early reviews are to be believed (but see Ebert's all-out glowing review.) Admittedly, the movie probably works better if you have read the first book (I had), but those readers are precisely the people who would likely complain the most. I worried and yet . . .",2007
1,"This movie was an if for me at first, being that it just seemed like one of the many quickly thrown together fantasy novels/movies that have supposed huge followings. However, I found myself sitting there in the theater, and to be honest, I was somewhat impressed at first, the effects were very good, and although you can still obviously tell CGI versus live action, very smooth. The actors did a great job with what they had, and what they had is what ruined the movie. The script was rough at best, with randomly thrown together scenes that were leading towards an Aha! moment that never came. The whole movie kept building, and the plot kept thickening. However, in the end we are left with a sub par battle and more questions than when the movie started.",2007

4,"I was so extremely excited for this movie, I had just read the books and truly could not wait to see how it translated to the screen having such a vivid and vibrant plot. My excitement was short lived however when this butchered movie began to roll. The largest flaw was that of character development. The whole beginning of the book truly creates Lyras character and her supporting characters such as Roger, Lord Asriel, Master of Jordan, and so forth; this instead was replaced with a few minutes of monologue, and if you happened to sneeze you would miss the explanation of daemons (which is integral to the plot) they could have included the catacomb exploration to explain that but alas they clipped that as well. And what about Lord Asriels visit, why change who tried to poison him? and what happened to the trepanned head of Stanislaus Grumman? This was a powerful scene in the book, but it became a 2 minute meeting on screen. Also, I don't know about you but I pictured Lord Asriel as this big powerful looking man that commanded a room, not quite Daniel Craig.",2007
8,"For some strange reason, a theater in the middle of the cornfield in Indiana had a sneak preview of the Golden Compass, and being a fan of the books I decided to take advantage of it. I wasn't sure what I was getting into, as there seems to be a rather large glut of Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings wannabes crowding theaters now and in the near future. This version of the Golden Compass beautifully brings the books to life and was very pleasing to watch with rather nice visuals. The acting is quite good, especially from the young lead, and the animation makes one wonder what they can't do with computers these days. The only true complaint I have about this movie is that it is difficult to understand and follow if one is not familiar with the books. Some scenes at the beginning seems disconnected, but after the halfway point the story comes together. The Golden Compass series is rather dark in its nature, and I'm glad that the movie didn't pull any punches with the supernatural combat (which is awesome, specifically when the witches and bears do battle). Some liberty is taken with the story as expected, and many church references are renamed, but the quality of the story never suffers. I recommend the movie and I look forward to seeing the rest of the trilogy completed.",2007
1,"When I first heard that The Golden Compass was going to be made into a movie, I had very low expectations.

3,"The Golden Compass was one of the most anticipated films of the year. With a budget well north of $150 million and a best seller as source material, expectations were high.

8,"I went in cynical about this, especially after the travesty that was the Narnia film, but i was quickly converted: it's great fun.

In casting his brother Casey you may think that it's just nepotism or giving his brother a break. No. He is the absolute perfect person to play this role. Because they know the area they have made one of the most authentic movies I've ever seen. And it's not just some Boston movie either. I heard a woman as I was leaving saying it's just like The Departed. No it's not, it's much better and the fact is, I loved The Departed. But that was flashier. As great as it was you could tell people were acting. Not here. They seemed exactly like the degenerates and handful of decent folk I see every day of my life.

10,"After a decade of critically disgraced performances and brutal public humiliation year after year, Ben Affleck took a well deserved break from the Hollywood scene. This year he came back, but instead of taking the spotlight by starring in a film, he went behind the scenes and opted to direct his first feature film. Taking an example from another actor turned director, a little independent man named Clint Eastwood, he decided to adapt a novel written by Mystic River author Dennis Lehane. On the surface, Gone Baby Gone tells the story of a missing child and the two private investigators who are hired to find her. The story transforms into a highly disturbing tale of selfish, terrifying characters and the fact that no matter what people never change.",2007
8,I had wanted to see this movie for sometime now. I have finally gotten to see it and can tell you it is no disappointment. This movie had a particular touch that gave a genuine and authentic feeling to it. Ben Affleck has a way of writing about life on the streets in Boston that just grabs you. Good Will Hunting was a fine example of that but Gone Baby Gone displayed his directing abilities as well. This movie appeared that it could fall apart any second but yet the story held up and managed to get its message out. Ben Affleck seems to be very creative and knows how to get your attention right when he want you to.,2008

Seeing a movie for me is being at the cinema showing it, paying for my ticket, and I hardly ever watch a movie in TV, direct or recorded. This means that in order to keep up with my statement of seeing almost everything I go to see movies a minimum of five and a maximum of seven days per week, and some days I attend several movies (this is not an exaggeration), meaning that I do get to see 250 to 300+ movies every year.",2007
9,"Anytime a movie can get you to pause and consider a moral dilemma (what would I have done?) while watching it definitely deserves a high mark in my book!! This movie showed the very raw, mean streets of Boston's underbelly and didn't sugar-coat anything. I liked that it was real and not made all pretty for film as in so many other films of late. I have/will recommend this movie to all my friends. Kudos to Casey Affleck, Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris. This was, so far, the best movie I've seen in 2007. I haven't been impressed with Ben Affleck in front of the camera, but maybe he's found his niche - behind the camera? Just go see it.",2007

7,"Ben Affleck's impressive directorial debut features some remarkably naturalistic performances, a genuine sense of locale, and an atmosphere of despair and hopelessness that becomes a major antagonist. An honestly downbeat film, it portrays a mode of existence where nothing is black or white, and it is that gray area that the film explores so effectively even if I find the story from Dennis Leheane's novel to be a bit far-fetched and convoluted. More than The Departed, Mystic River, and Peter Yates' The Friends of Eddie Coyle, Gone, Baby, Gone understands the inter-relationship among cops, criminals, and a neighborhood as they search for a missing child. Though the boyish Casey Affleck is arguably miscast as Patrick, a character who was more mature in the novel, his performance cannot be faulted and by the end he has won us over. The last scene is particularly resonant. Though well-known actors such as Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman are expectedly good, it is the performances of an unknown supporting cast that gives the film a disturbing authenticity. And Amy Ryan as the child's mother gives a trenchant performance. Director Affleck maintains an admirable tone of objectivity and compassion throughout, and he has made a film that is worthy of your time. Go!Baby!Go!",2007
9,"People everywhere cringe at the thought of their child being abducted. Anyone who has watched any of the prime-time news channels in the last several years can see that every major news network devotes huge amounts of time to abduction and kidnapping stories. This is a clear reflection of the heart and conscience of a global society today. Every single human has a family, and knows from a primal understanding that all children are innocent, and are dependent on 2 parents and their extended families to protect them, teach them, and guide them down a path toward independence in the world.",2007
8,"The tough private eyes Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) was raised in a poor and dangerous neighborhood of Boston, and works with his partner and girlfriend Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan) generally tracking missing losers in debt. When the four year-old Amanda McCready (Madeline O'Brien) is abducted from her apartment, her aunt Beatrice 'Bea' McCready (Amy Madigan) calls the police and the press, and the case is highlighted with the spots by the media. Then Bea hires the reluctant Patrick to work in the case because he is not a cop and based on his great knowledge of their neighborhood. Meanwhile Capt. Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman), who lost his own daughter many years ago and is in charge of the investigation, assigns detectives Remy Bressant (Ed Harris) and Nick Pole (John Ashton) to give the necessary support to Patrick. After interviewing the addicted low life mother of Amanda, Helene McCready (Amy Ryan), Patrick goes to a bar and discloses that Helene was on the streets with her boyfriend Skinny Ray Likanski (Sean Malone) dealing and using drugs on the day Amanda disappeared. Along his investigation, Patrick faces smalltime criminals, drug dealers, pedophiles and corruption, facing a moral issue to solve the case.",2008
7,"This is an extremely well made movie. It is an extremely well acted movie. Despite being well done and telling a captivating story, it just isn't what I want from a story or a movie in general. Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) and Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan) are called in as private detectives by a family to investigate a missing child report. Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman)and Detective Remy Bressant (Ed Harris) represent the reluctant, yet cooperative police department that works hand in hand with the private detectives. The story evolves as a mystery leading the viewer along as everyone sifts through the lies and cover-ups. While this story is quite emotional and disturbing at times, the final message is a bit anti-climactic. It comes across more as a social statement directed towards an American subculture than it does being a plausible series of events. In the end, it just all seems pointless. It isn't a bad movie, it just isn't how I'd want to spend 2 hours of leisure time. Casey Affleck does a great job at keeping the story on track. Michelle Monaghan plays a convincing girlfriend/assistant. Ed Harris & Morgan Freeman never skip a beat on making you feel distressed about the little girl being lost. The ending just made me not care about how well it was acted and composed. Ben Affleck's role as director and screenplay writer seems to be invisible just as it should be. Anyone wishing to praise him or criticize his role, should spend their time reviewing his past work, not this piece.",2007
5,"The idea behind this film is fundamentally a good one - which is not surprising since it is based on a novel. And despite the horribly clichéd, implausible and convoluted screenplay, some of those original ideas remain. Also, to be fair, there are some nice moments in the film and it does not go Spielberg on us.",2007

7,"It is now largely forgotten that Ben Affleck's big break was not as an actor in but as a writer of ""Good Will Hunting"". His career has never lived up to the promise of his performance in that film (a quiet and subtle display) and has been overshadowed by the success of his friend and co-Oscar-winner, Matt Damon. With ""Gone Baby Gone"", Affleck moves back behind the camera, directing and writing, whilst his brother Casey, who really impressed in ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"", takes the lead.",2008
6,"A somewhat entertaining morality drama of the Hollywood variety, this baby doesn't really get going until the convoluted first and second acts are played out, culminating in a more emotionally involving conclusion. Speckled with much homegrown Bah-stonian flavor, the newfound directorial talents of big bro Ben Affleck to portray the city he loves with a notion of gritty integrity perhaps overwhelms with some shiftily stereotypical minor characters- both in look and delivery, but the core cast remain strong enough to let the overcooked plot come to a gentle simmer when we finally are able to understand what all the messy details add up to. The result is certainly far shy of the riveting, infinitely ponderous conclusion some have suggested, but still absolutely enough to make for a decent night of serious entertainment for mainstream American audiences.",2008
5,"I was giving Ben Affleck a chance showing better competence as director than he was showing as actor - and I regret it. I was thinking that 8 out of 10 points on the rank was indicating a great movie. The Boston area where the story is set and its inhabitant is staged like a Freak Show for people living in better areas to shudder and be happy to not live there - a tad too much paint I would say. The movie seems to convey several doubtful messages: that child molesters are never stopping their doings anyway - teaming up even, that self-justice is excusable and what is worst - that stealing kids from bad mothers is justified. I haven't read the book, but the movie doesn't seem to want to motivate the private detective's (Michelle Monaghan) feeling concerning stealing the child. The usual corrupt cops topic doesn't require any additional comment really. As a last comment: I wouldn't have been surprised if Jennifer Lopez had taken a role in this movie to make it a truly Bennifer experience of a movie.",2007
1,"Where do I begin? I read several positive reviews about this film that made it sound interesting and poignant. It was apparently meant to be a film about dilemma that was primarily designed to make the viewer reflex on its message and think about their' own moral decision making. What would you do, type of thing. By the time the moral of the story came – I no longer cared. The film was a huge disappointment. First of all, the story is confusing and disjointed. Ben Affleck directs like he acts – like a teenager with A.D.D. The characters were uninteresting, unmotivated and miscast. Casey Affleck (Patrick Kenzie) as a private eye looks more like Dookie Howser than Mike Hammer. He tries so hard to master the Boston accent that he is difficult to understand - not that he has anything interesting to say. So little time is spent on character development that the viewer doesn't really care about who any of these people are or what happens to them. Michelle Monaghan literally sleep walks through her role as Affleck's girlfriend and partner, muttering a few phrases occasionally so you won't mistake her for a mannequin, but so uninspired that one wonders who she was cozy with to get the role. (I think you can all figure out how Casey Affleck got the lead role). Ed Harris, who is a good actor, does his best with the uninspired dialogue but his efforts are wasted on a part that no one could have saved. Most disappointing of all is Morgan Freemen's role as Jack Doyle. Morgan appears as an aging police official – who looks to be about 80 – who for some reason ""lost"" a 12 year old daughter. OK, that's possible, but improbable. While his name appears prominently in the advertisements for this debacle, Freeman's character shows up in about 5 minutes of the actual film. In conclusion, the acting is second rate, the characters inadequately developed and the story poorly told. Gone Baby Gone should have been titled Bad Baby Bad –it stunk.",2009
1,Spoiler Alert So the sanctimonious prick lead character can murder someone in cold blood and participate in a drug deal but also feels the moral compulsion to turn in the good-hearted cop who was trying to offer that poor little girl a better life? God that was stupid! ,2008
1,Ben Affleck... better stick to acting and don't even dream about directing ever again. This movie is such a disappointment and the rating is completely misleading.,2008
1,"South Park warned us that Ben Affleck was annoying and horrible to watch on screen - say hello to his brother! If his depressing voice isn't enough to kill this movie, it's his awful acting. When will Hollywood stop producing movies with these two? I feel sorry for every actor in this movie that had to listen to his voice.",2017
10,"Ben Affleck must be kicking himself. I'm sure it passed through his mind when he was making particularly empty vehicles as an actor and turning in self-conscious performances as Daredevils and Dick heroes that he wasn't enriching the history of cinema and had somehow joined the Forces of Evil, conspiring against the wellbeing of humanity by cashing in on a watery culture of cinematic mediocrity. He knows that film at its best can make the world a better place – somehow. It is implicit in the script of Good Will Hunting. Then Hollywood came along and tried to tell him otherwise and he forgot, like those flawed heroes who become mired in just getting by everyday after their fall from grace. Well, consider Gone Baby Gone his vengeance. It is superb. Immensely detailed, textured and nuanced he uses his own brother Casey as his alter ego to confront a world mired in selfishness and deception. The Afflecks will attempt to do what is right, what is good, and yet! It is the ""and yet..!"" that makes this film so special even beyond the great performances of pretty much every actor in the show. Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan play Patrick and Angie, life partners as well as professional partners in their business of private detectives. They are hired by the relatives of a child who has been kidnapped from her drug-using irresponsible mother (Amy Ryan playing Helene McCready in one of those turns that is unfortunately so richly convincing you don't actually think she is acting). Patrick may be street wise but there is a youth and innocence to him that makes the viewer feel protective. Those hand-picked masters of gravitas, Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris play 'the grown ups' as it were. Freeman is the police chief who has suffered a young daughter being murdered in the past and at first appears as a minor character in it all. Harris plays Remy Bressant, the seasoned cop working with colleague Nic Poole (John Ashton) obliged to share their findings with the young pair. The relationship proves to be mutually beneficial as they delve inside the shabby crime kingdom of Boston with its drug lynch pins, hustlers, thugs and users. From a Dennis Lehane novel the script by Affleck (Ben) and Aaron Stockard handsomely builds up the detail and complexity of the story. Affleck knows how to make a scene count and there are stings and zingers throughout this two hour movie that make each word and image essential and watchable. The writers also take a big chance with structure, chucking the (recently) time-honored three act system out the window, as the film is divided into two halves. It is a risk to take nowadays as audiences are so used to the set up, but it pays off because of the density of events and - that rare thing nowadays – real character development. At the heart is Casey Affleck's prickly boyish persona, both strong and brittle, a resolute and doubting crusader, vulnerable and untouchable, a sinner or a saint in the making.",2011
8,"i only started watching this recently and now i'm hooked. i watched one episode just to say i had and ended up watching about 10episodes in a row. this a lot smarter than i thought, the one-liners are excellent, the characters have depth, and the story is pretty good as well. spade is good as the weaselly playboy, Hudson is good as the idiot, the women are good at being the kinda normal average women in relationships, but Patrick Warburton is the star. his timing is perfect, his delivery is excellent and he comes across a genuinely like-able guy. a guy that most guys could relate to. all in all i think there is something or someone in the show that most people can relate to and enjoy.",2011
7,"Generally speaking, the plot was much better than I was expecting. The laugh track was a bit annoying at times and did tend to get in the way; however, there were enough real chuckles in this episode to make up for it. My biggest surprise was finding some of the best lines and situations were not shown in the trailers. Spade, in particular, was not presented in the best light in the earlier promotions, but his character comes across quite well in the pilot. There is is enough eye-candy to please almost anyone and all the regular characters seem up to the task ahead of them. Now, if the writers can just live up to what they have begun.",2007
10,"I missed almost all of the first season, but when the other shows went to reruns, I started watching. I ended up buying the entire first season off iTunes. This is now one of my favorite comedy shows. Patrick Warburton is the key. His dry sense of humor has me rolling all the time. David Spade is funny, but sometimes a little Russell goes a long way. I enjoy the other cast members more (but not saying he doesn't add to the show).",2009
10,I love this show! Patrick Warburton is hilarious! All the characters of the series are great however i'm not a huge fan of the little dwarf 'Russel'. His acting looks really forced and sometimes it's over the top.,2011
10,"This show will succeed because it appeals to all adults no matter where they are in their relationship. As a man married for 26 years, I empathize with Patrick Warburton's character: he loves his wife, but he assumes she knows that. I also enjoy his monotone delivery; never gets too excited or too low. A nice ensemble of characters. This will be a nice addition to the Monday night line-up.",2007
8,"This would have to be one of the funniest TV sitcoms to come out of the States since the demise of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"". Warburton is always hilarious, and in this complements the rest of the ensemble cast to perfection. David Spade continues to tickle my funny bone enormously with his quite unique delivery of his lines. After having raved over the British series, ""Coupling"" I can see from just where the creators of ""Rules of Engagement"" got their original idea, but this is not intended as being a ""brickbat"" - the absolutely brilliant dialogue and the way in which it is conveyed set this particular series completely apart. But it takes more than a competent cast to bring success to a new series, particularly in the very difficult field of comedy. Having been a part of a professional TV comedy writing team for the best part of 7 years in Australia, I can appreciate particularly, the role of director and the perceptional and creative talent of the camera crew. One of the few grievances I have with the series is the very obviously ""canned"" laughter. Surely a live audience could have been used in the shooting of the series.",2008

In the past, a successful mid-season replacement like Wings would have been ordered a full season. Anyway, the cast is first rate with Patrick Warburton and Megyn Pryce as the veteran married couple without children living in New York City. Oliver Hudson plays the long engaged man and I forget his fiancé. David Spade is perfect as the single bachelor guy. This season, they have hired Timmy who is wonderfully played by Raj from Aliens in America series. Timmy is his long-suffering assistant and the perfect person to have some laughs with. He's Indian and he's arranged in a marriage according to his parents. Anyway, I enjoy having Timmy and Spade on as much as the other cast members. They have unusual relationship as employer and employee and as unlikely friends.",2010
6,"I hate most of the new laugh track sitcoms. The writing revolves around immature sexual innuendos. The sitcom died when Seinfeld, ELR, and the King of queens left television. While this show is not innocent of using unimaginative sex puns, it does have many likable characters. Patrick Warburton brings us back to the old days of David Puddy, and if you're a fan of David Spade's obnoxious sarcasm, you will definitely get your fill. Perhaps the biggest surprise; however, is the South African Indian actor Adhir Kalyan. His timing is impeccable, and as David Spades assistant, the dialogue between the two is hysterical. Ultimately, this show does not come close to the big three mentioned earlier, but it is by far the best out there today.",2013
10,"This show is absolutely hilarious. I have watched every season and it keeps getting better and better. I think the reason that it is so funny is that the interactions between the couples and their friends has enough realism that everyone can relate to it. The little spats between the couples are verbatim spats that I have had in my relationship....Jeff is the perfect exaggerated version of the ""Everyman"". The writing is so sharp, this show has the best one-liner zingers on TV right now. There is a reason why this show keeps holding on even though CBS does absolutely nothing to promote it. Rules is totally hysterically and completely underrated.",2013
9,"Most of the negative comments seem to be about Patrick Warburton's role as Jeff. I guess if you were not a Puddy fan from Seinfeld then perhaps you would not appreciate him. Even the diner they eat in reminds me of the diner in Seinfeld. The way they seem to always eat in the coffee shop though, I have never understood that, in Seinfeld or this show. This must be a New York thing... I think Patrick Warburton is hilarious in his role as Jeff, a loving husband, in his own way, a real mans man...",2011

After a long search for a similar show with less inappropriate content I discovered 'Rules Of Engagement.' I was disappointed to find that the characters don't appear to have much depth, nor do they feel very real. The writing is not as good as it is in HIMYM, and the actors are over the top, especially Patrick Warburton. David Spade is one of my all time favorite comedians and he plays a character much like Barney Stinson, unfortunately he is not as good for the part as Neil Patrick Harris. The show is too far consumed with the comedy to take a moment for a moral of the story. It's funny, fairly clean, and semi-well written. It's a good show with decent comedians, and a good plot. Worth the watch.",2012

David Spade is a classic womanizer, with his age, And Timmy, is a hoot. Adam will never grow up and Jennifer will always have to lead him in the right direction. Now the baby. I was looking forward to seeing how Jeff can deal with a child.",2013

2,"Only Checked out the show because of David Spade. But was disappointed by very poor and cheesy writing and over exaggerated audience laughter. The characters have Zero chemistry and you do not feel any personal connection to anyone of the characters. You occasionally see David Spade who cracks out a Dennis Finch comment,he does not belong there but at the same time he is the only slightly funny thing in the show, its a vicious circle. The show lacks any kind of X-factor. Feels like every line has been done before in another show. The constant marriage jokes are as outdated as a mother in law joke, they seem to be the basis for 90% of the shows dialogue usually said by the 'Joe Swanson' character who's dry comments are not backed up by any clever or witty content. The lack of innovation in the show begs the question how was this idea for a script passed.",2012
1,"It seems that liking or disliking this show hinges on whether you like Patrick Warburton or not. He may be displaying consummate acting skills in portraying a corporate clod, but I can find no humor in this show at all. It seems to be a cynical attempt to cater for a certain demographic - middle-class couples in early middle age. I only ever see a couple of minutes of this show, since in Britain it's on just before ""The Big Bang Theory"" (aimed presumably at 20-somethings, but has me laughing at 63). Just a few seconds of RoE and I turn the sound off - the dialog is painful, the whole show seems to be utterly formulaic and robotic.",2012

Sitting back and enjoying the wild ride is your best choice in getting the full enjoyment out of this flick. Containing a diverse cast that works quite well, a handful of funny cameos, tons of predictable yet enjoyable scenarios, and a rather surprising amount of physical humor; Wild Hogs is a startlingly delightful comedy that isn't afraid to reach low for a laugh.

Sometimes I wonder if they are on certain payrolls to give a certain vote towards a movie. With that said---Wild Hogs is absolutely wonderful. In today's day of poor comedies (see anything starring Will Farrell for example) that do not produce a laugh or a smirk---Wild Hogs is a breath of fresh air. I have lately been happy if a movie has at least one good laugh to feel like my admission fee was worth spending. And in today's movie world, most movies are one joke wonders. Wild Hogs is a throw back to the days of My Cousin Vinny, Airplane, and Young Frankenstein. This movie was filled with laughs and good gags. The movie starts off slow and is reminiscent of a couple of failed Tim Allen projects (Shaggy Dog and Zoom), but after about 15 minutes it shifts gear and becomes a wonderful comedy well worth spending the admission fee. If you want to have a good laugh and enjoy yourself---see Wild Hogs.",2007

10,Like so many others in the Theater I could not stop laughing. Even when tears were abundant running down my cheeks and my side hurt. Luckily everyone else was just as loud with laughter so I was not the only laughing fool in the place. With this group I didn't know quite what to expect as sometimes they are funny and sometimes not so much. The antics and the character actors in this film was PURE genius. It has the type of humor for everyone. Must see and Must DVD buy. Glad to see at least one good movie for 2007. Tim Allen and John Travolta who would have thought ? The big surprise in the film was William Macey. I din't realize the guy could be that funny. He played to comic goof and pulled it off with flying colors. Hats off to all.,2007
4,"I was disappointed with the film - It had a lot of potential but frankly missed the mark. By a long shot. It was not only slow to start, to establish the characters and the point, but the gaps between actual gags that raised more than a faint smile were huge. The majority of the film rotated around gay jokes which could be spotted by a blind man a mile away. But the saving grace was that the usual puns concerning the only black member of the group were avoided. Another disappointing factor was the 'oh so didn't see that coming' policeman - who was just Dr Cox, from Scrubs, in a policeman's uniform, almost as though Scrubs were filming next door and the actor didn't have time to get out of the Dr Cox character. Anyway, I believe that I have said enough - enjoy the film.",2007
3,"(Spoilers) Wild Hogs was your typical, quasi-funny movie that flames out at the end. This movie started off decently, hovering at least in the 5 - 6 area of scoring. The first half was decent, but was nothing to be proud of. The only funny parts are really in the beginning, such as when Macy's computer accidentally goes onto porn. After that, the movie started to go downhill a little, and still delivered. I can admit that, for a movie that has a guy crapping into a plastic bag, I did laugh at parts in the beginning. Then, the ""Wild Hogs"" met the other bikers, and it was all over. The freaking explosion in back of them looked like a nuclear bomb. I was hoping that the Del Fuego idiots were being roasted just to get rid of their bad, over the top acting. Instead, they of course have to come back and torture us some more. After this, the movie became dry and boring: you will look at the clock every 2 seconds. John Travolta becomes unbelievably annoying, and stock characters jump out of the woods like a Vietnamese ambush. In review, Wild Hogs was more like a G movie. The Wild West town that they went to was more like a cartoon, where Yosemite Sam would jump out and fire his revolvers into the air.",2007
8,"I saw a screening of Wild Hogs with a theatre full of bikers, many of whom were similar to the Wild Hogs characters in the film. We laughed our way through the entire movie even as some of the situations came perilously close to our own secret weekend biker lives.",2007
2,"I was recently talked into going to see this movie by my girlfriend, and I must say that it was a disappointment to say the least. This movie reminded me of a live action cartoon, with all of the old pratfalls, bathroom humor, and homosexual innuendos and humor that we have all seen a million times before. The characters portray every stereotype of men in middle age (wives that boss them around, kids who think they are ""lame"", not being allowed to eat anything but lettuce, etc, etc, etc). The script seemed like it was written by a 12 year old, and the jokes were very stale and unfunny. The fact that this movie has been #1 in the country for several weeks running only illustrates the lack of anything decent in theaters. The movie did feature a great cast (including a few nice cameos), but even that couldn't save this film. If you're looking for mindless humor and a predicable script, go and see this mess. Otherwise, save your money.",2007
10,"Although I though this was a little slow in the very beginning and some of the earlier gags just silly, I found myself laughing throughout and the laughs kept coming louder and harder as the movie progressed. Tim Allen and William Macy shined in this. Macy's character being particularly well done. Travolta played the tough guy in the group but he was no match for the real bad guys they ran into. This movie is studded with Televions stars. Jill Hennesy is terrific as Allen's wife and she isn't in this enough. Stars from Lost and Scrubs appear too. Some of the situations are incredibly funny, such as when Macy convinces the other to go skinny dipping. The conflict ending is a bit of a surprise, but an enjoyable one and don't forget to watch the credits. They are hilarious. Overall this is a real hoot so 10 stars.",2007

Unoriginal by any standard. 4 guys in a midlife crisis hit the road on motorbikes in order to regain their lost youth. If that theme is not lame enough, the concept is diluted further by a series of slapstick like-events turning them from losers to heroes of a sleepy provincial town. ",2007

I am not the kind of person who rates everything 1's or 10's, nor do I write reviews regularly, but there was something singularly distasteful about this film that begged for a reaming on IMDb. I honest to god felt slightly brain-damaged for almost cracking a smile toward the end.",2007
2,"William H. Macy is the kind of actor who can brighten up just about any film he appears in. He's got a certain charm and likability that he brings to just about every performance. It is perhaps no surprise that Macy is not only the best thing about Wild Hogs, but is also the film's sole highlight. I wanted to see his character appear in a better movie. The movie that surrounds the performance is a plot less and pointless exercise in tired slapstick and homophobic humor. Light as a feather and dumb as a brick, Wild Hogs flounders about lifelessly whenever Macy isn't on the screen.",2007
4,"It's interesting to me how some people can deride films like ""Xanadu"" or, say, ""Mermaids"" as bombs, when a movie like this does well at the box-office, but will probably NEVER develop the following that those films have earned over time. There was really no point to this film. It's a few funny bits stretched out into a feature length movie. We only get a tiny taste of the protagonists' lives before they set upon their journey, so we don't really care (nor does the film ever bother to foreshadow) what is to become of them when it's over. In the meantime, we are expected to sit through lots of tedious dialogue involving midlife crises and speculation on where their lives took those mundane turns. There are also several--make that WAY TOO MANY--references which to me were not so much homophobic as just plain, well, let's call them ""homo-stupid.""",2007
1,"A terrible movie.... I barely cracked a smile at 2 parts in this awful movie. Bad acting, stupid stunts and lines are so cheesy. Martin Lawerence, Ray Liotta, Tim Allen, and especially Marissa Toimei sadly ended their careers with this unfunny flick. It's a real shame. Travolta does any movie he can, and better watch out again in falling out of the Hollywood limelight. It happen before in the early 80's and it's very possible with a another bad one. Macy was funny in Fargo, definitely not here. Waste of 90 minutes for sure. And writing this review. I had to warn the dedicated movie watcher. Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad....",2007
2,I'm always deeply suspicious when the majority of the highest rated good reviews are from reviewers who have only written the one review for just this one film - and here it seems to be the case.,2007
1,"If this picture took 39,000,000 it's first weekend, then all I can say is there must have been a whole-hell-of-a-bunch of angry and disappointed movie goers.",2008
1,"I'm sorry but Travolta should be ashamed of this role. I tried to like this movie but it was painful to watch. My wife liked it much more than I did but there is no way I could agree with much of what she liked in this film. Considering the fact that the film had some serious ""A"" list actors...it's was a pitiful example of a bunch of stars getting together to have a good ole time making a piece of garbage. This could have been a really good film too. The premise of a group of middle aged guys hitting the road on Harleys has a good feel about it. The music was good too...but the film was a sad case of lots of money and no substance. It reminded me of the Burt Reynolds crap from the 80's...""Cannon Ball Run"". What a waste of time and talent. Sorry!",2007
5,"As a 48 year old weekend biker I was very much looking forward to this film, but after reading the overwhelmingly positive reviews by other posters I have to wonder if I saw a different version of this movie. I felt the chemistry between the stars was lacking and many of the sets were contrived. This film reminded me of a low budget made for TV effort and was as predictable as the day is long. I tried to eat my popcorn and treat the movie as pure fluff, but I kept thinking - would I like to be on this road trip with these guys? The answer was a resounding NO. I won't say it was all bad, and there were several funny scenes, but this is not one I would see again.",2007
10,"Because of low box office returns in the USA (total gross: 25 million $; movie's budget: 100 million), that outrageously mouth-watering experiment known as Grindhouse was split in half for the European release: first came Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof, a masterful reinvention of the slasher flick, the main strength of which was focusing on characters and atmosphere rather than film references; and now comes Planet Terror, Robert Rodriguez's zombie opus which has ""excessive"" (read: fun) written all over it.",2007
9,"While Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof seems to be a much more authentic representation of 1970s grindhouse pictures, Robert Rodriguez' Planet Terror is more of a loving caricature of 1980s zombie splatter films. Nothing in the film is played straight, and virtually every scene is accompanied by a wink and a grin at the audience.",2007
9,"Planet Terror, before becoming it's own movie-animal of sorts as a stand-alone feature released in most parts of the world (and on DVD), was a slightly shorter, near-perfect first part of a double-bill of the Rodriguez/Tarantino double-feature Grindhouse. Not to sound like I'm in a rocking chair rambling like it's old times (and it's not even a year since its North American release), but Grindhouse contained in it two features that just very simply, quickly tapped into that genuine spirit of B-movies out there, the art and power of sleaze and trash that might not be that when done right. And also as a treat, each film showcases, in all fetishized and stupendous glory, the skills of the respective filmmakers (this goes as well for the directors of the 'trailers' that ran between the two films). For Tarantino it's stylized long-shots, intellectual-cum-vapid dialog, and a penchant for bad-ass ladies and some sick violence.",2008
8,"Everyone I know loves this movie, including my Girlfriend. Yes, it has it's gross-out moments, but they are all so over the top that they aren't all that disturbing. The whole movie is supposed to be grimy and cheesy so if you expect a slick Hollywood blockbuster you might be disappointed. If you are a fan of MST3K movies then check this one out. It's an amazing recreation of a movie they'd watch! I mean that as a compliment. I found Death Proof to be slightly Borning until the last 20 minutes. But, in this movie, it's almost all non-stop action! There are also some really funny cuts, dialog and special effects. This movie is not to be taken seriously. Turn down the lights, get some popcorn and enjoy the ride!",2007
8,"I've seen a fairly large segment of this film and don't understand either of the two negative reviews at all. I classed it as a zombie flick and as such found it a good addition to the genre. To say it is the sickest (notice the correct spelling) film ever made shows a complete lack of cinema knowledge to the extent of idiocy. Anyone who has seen any of Rodriquez's previous work will not be in the least bit surprised by anything in this film and will probably enjoy as such. If you like the Horror genre, especially Zombies, which are thankfully making a return to cinema, you will find a special place in your dark and twisted hearts for this. I have and can't wait to see it on the big screen. Makes a refreshing change from the horror pap that's come out of Hollywood in the last decade.",2007
7,"For some reason the original double feature movie of Grindhouse combining Planet Terror with Tarantino's effort was never released in the UK! Regardless, i was still curious to watch both efforts, and the first of which I've had the chance to see is Planet Terror.",2007
8,"Planet Terror is a homage to the trash that used to play at drive-ins back in the 70s, particularly, its a zombie film. Being a lover of zombies I was stoked when I sat down to watch it. The movie delivers everything a fan of the horror-comedy-action genre could want, over the top action, over the top gore, and at times over the top acting. We follow a few main characters, all of which are enigmatic and end up having connections that no one would have seen coming, which reminded me of the low budget films that used to come out back in the day, where the director would try to weave in so many subplots the whole thing becomes silly (and a lot of fun)...",2008
10,WARNING: I advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment.,2008
6,According to word of mouth the double feature of GRINDHOUSE flopped in the United States because people walked out of the cinema not realising the concept of a double feature . Even if there is some truth in this surely if people have paid their money to watch a film it won't affect the box office as to when an audience walk out on the film ? One thinks there's an apocryphal myth at play here similar to the French audience who ran out screaming from a late 19th Paris cinema as soon as an on screen train came puffing head on towards them . Perhaps the low box office return for the GRINDHOUSE double bill was much lower than expected was that the two films were too expensively stylised to make an expected profit ? Why go to so much expense to make a couple of B movies on an A list budget when so many hacks in the 1970s were able to do it on a Z list budget ? ,2013
1,"The idea was to make a cool, fun, artsy homage to the grind house horror films of the 70s. I get it. It fails.",2008
1,"Okay, this film was supposed to be a parody, but even with that low standard, it could have been better. The whole bit about the machine gun attachment for the one-legged woman was extremely insulting to even the lowest level of intelligence. How could she possibly have pulled the trigger? How?? The thing with the jar of testicles - does this really pass for entertainment in western civilization? This film suffered because it was crude and pandered to the lowest of lowlifes. I'll admit that it had a better take on the ""living dead"" than most films of this genre. I have to go back to the machine-gun to leg attachment: it may have been the singularly most stupid thing I've seen outside of a Popeye cartoon. By the way, this woman had just gotten her leg amputated earlier in the evening. She sure recovers from surgery quickly - no pain meds, no post-op drowsiness from anesthesia....really stupid; too stupid to be a successful parody.",2009
1,"This is a kind of movie, in which you don't know, what going to happen next and there is no laws on earth, which can explain why? The max you can do, some how shut your brain down, and just laugh on every possible movement of the movie. The story has nothing to do with reality or even since friction. The characters look completely unrelated to the plot or I must say, they are opposite to the plot. This is what makes them kind of funny. The action is quite good and at some part funny too which remind me about Hollywood Movie. The movie is much more like a spoof but the thing is that, you don't know, spoof of which movies.",2008
7,"Rodriguez's half of the original 'grindhouse' double bill , which consisted of his TERROR PLANET with Tarantino's DEATH PROOF. Likely audience reactions led to the two titles being separated and issued apart. As a homage to the drive-in tradition and genres beloved by Tarantino et al, the two films are resolutely exploitative, but PLANET is the most overtly tongue in cheek, and the most enjoyable, being a good old shoot 'em up Zombie flic. Unlike SIN CITY which was inspired by good source work which led to it being rather self consciously 'cool', PLANET tries hard to mimic bad work that, by definition of its admirers is *unconsciously* cool. This reviewer at least found the results less pretentious, the trash origins not being made more of than they ever were - the sexist treatment of women for instance less insidious.",2008
1,"Really... the story is stolen, so is almost every character, the acting is worse - i mean i can understand that, i don't think there's anyone who act out any part of this ridiculous brain-free plot...",2008

3,"Okay, I got the idea. 'Make a Grind-y, messy, crazy movie that will be an homage to the bad films we saw as kids.' Not a bad idea either. And it worked out quite well for Death Proof, Quentin Tarantino's side of the project. But Planet Terror...is just not a good movie.",2010
3,"First of all, I felt really offended at times by this movie. Don't get me wrong, I personally love the idea of a cripple attaching a weapon to his/her severed limb (Ash of ""Evil Dead"" is a divinity to me). What was offensive about it is that it felt like Rodriguez was more dissing the genre and its fans, than paying tribute to it and them. The thing is that great Splatter movies are usually made on a low budget, but by people highly devoted to both the special kind of humor of the splatter genre, and the art of cinema itself. There are numerous examples of quite well-known gore flicks made by enthusiasts for no foreseeable profit at all, such as Evil Dead and Bad Taste. These movies are however always made to be all they CAN be. Shure there are usually goofs and plot-holes the size of grand canyon, but they are usually not deliberate, as they are in ""Planet Terror"". If you watch Rodriguez's ""From Dusk 'til Dawn"" there is a perfect example of a movie made with love, to be all it could be.",2007

1,"This is supposed to be either a tribute or a spoof of grindhouse films of yesteryear. Since there is hardly any humor in it, it must be a tribute. What is the point of paying tribute to bad, low-budget movies by making one that is as bad and as cheap-looking as any in the genre? The plot is a rehash of films like ""Dawn of the Dead,"" where zombies are walking around eating people. This one does nothing to reinvent the genre. The film is just an excuse to film a lot of disgusting, gory violence, which is not entertainment. The only positive is that there are some hot-looking women, including McGowan, who looks fine whether sporting one leg or two.",2008
9,"For me this is the best Comedy/Horror since Peter Jackson's Braindead, just pushing Shaun of the Dead into third place. It's unashamedly silly and over the top from start to finish, with a good cast, funny lines, gore and action.",2008
2,This movie seems to be quite divisive. Some people love it while others absolutely hate it. There is actually a pretty simple way to tell which side of the coin you will find yourself on: Within the first 20 minutes of this movie you will see the following:,2008
10,"I am a fan of Tarantino, though I'm slighty disappointed with his portion in the Tarantino- Rodriguez Grindhouse partnership. It's classic Tarantino with the excellent dialogue, but Death Proof seemed to be lacking something, and seemed more like a Tarantino movie done Blaxploitation style. Now Rodriguez's offering with Planet Terror is the bomb, and it is miles better than Death Proof in containing the spirit of Grindhouse, and that it doesn't seem to have his fingerprints and stylistic references all over it, making it a truly wicked grindhouse experience.",2007
2,"I get what Robert Rodriguez was trying to accomplish with PLANET TERROR, a spoof of 60s-70s-80s zombie flicks, but I just didn't like it! Half of the GRINDHOUSE double-bill (Tarantino's DEATH PROOF was the other half), this half is actually has a slightly higher IMDb rating and more viewers seem to understand what Rodriguez was actually doing (most, including myself, don't understand what the hell Tarantino was thinking!).",2009
10,"If you could distill out the clever irreverent wit and the ""something for all ages"" mix of gags and references from ""Family Guy"", ""The Simpsons"", ""SpongeBob"", and South Park""; and then jettison all the off-color, negative, and crude low-hanging fruit elements of those cartoons you would get something like The Disney Channel's ""Phineas and Ferb"" which premiered in August 2007. ",2008
10,I love this show. I thinks its one of the funniest things on TV. I love the humor. Its very well written. It reminds me a bit of Dave the Barbarian's humor. My favorite characters are Dr. Doofenshmirtz and Perry the Platapus. ,2008
9,"When I first heard about the show, my first thought was ""Oh great, another Disney Channel show that will probably be as bad as Hannah Montana or Wizards of Waverly Place."" I figured it wouldn't be good. It turned out that I was wrong....",2009
9,"I have to admit. When I first saw the premier of this show, I thought to myself, ""great. Disney comes up with yet another stupid cartoon."" Recently, however, I gave it another shot. And you know what? This is really good stuff. I mean, yeah, some people may write it off as stupid animation, but where else do you get a ""Replacements/Kim Possible/Suite Life of Zach and Cody"" all-in-one show? If you want to see a young teenager trying to win the attention of her crush, it's in there! If you want to see two boys making mischief and getting away with it, it's in there! And if you prefer secret-agent shows, it's got that too! Perry Platypus is very cleverly woven into the main plot. Some of the missions may seem ridiculous, but, after all, this is a cartoon!",2008
8,"Phineas and Ferb has to be the smartest and most adult show ever created for an under-12 audience. Seriously, what other show features songs that rhyme 'didactic' with 'anti-climactic', uses the Freudian model for the human mind as a key story device, tosses in movie references, artistic motifs and literary allusions obscure enough to challenge a film scholar, sneaks in a psychedelic drug trip or two thanks to some toxic moss, and then cuts away to its secondary plot arc in a secret world where everybody's pet is a government crime fighter? Did I mention that every song cleverly parodies a different genre, style, period or artist, or that each secondary crime fighting plot intrudes momentarily on the main story line at just the right spot in each episode to wreak the most havoc? Though the show's target audience likely catches little of this, they no doubt appreciate the creative richness that informs it all. And most importantly, the show's popularity proves that they find it all FUN.",2012
9,"""Phineas and Ferb"" is by far one of the funniest shows to hit Disney Channel where I couldn't stop laughing after the first episode. It's not like other cartoons on Disney Channel such as ""The Replacements"", ""Kim Possible"", ""The Emperor's New Groove"", ""The Proud Family"", or any other cartoon where those shows can't even find a laugh.",2008
10,"Occasionally there comes along animation that strikes that delicate balance between being funny for the kids and being funny for the adults too. The last time I found such a series was Rocky and Bullwinkle. Phineas and Ferb while it fits nicely in the mainstream of Disney animation still has enough real humor that it isn't sappy like so many other Disney products tend to be. And unlike the ""post modern"" Rocky and Bullwinkle, which is filled with acid like social commentary this one is just as smooth and sweet as a baby's bottom.",2010
8,"When I first heard about this series, I thought that it was going to be pretty bad. However, it ended being very good! I liked it a lot, it is possible the best animated series made by Disney since ""Gargoyles"". Created by Dan Povermire and Jeffrey Marsh (Who also give their voices to some of the characters) this show is funny, clever and original. At first, it seems very predictable (Almost all the episodes follow a very similar structure) However, the writers manage to keep this show fresh with a witty dialogue and a very interesting character development, not to mention the catchy songs, one of the best parts of it.",2010
9,"I started watching this recently with the kids, and I think I get more out of it than they do. The visual ref to North by Northwest in ""Bigfoot"", Doofenschmirtz' awkward introduction of his new nemesis to Perry the Platipus, all the musical numbers (watchable on You Tube)...I no longer try to explain to my kids why it's funnier to me than it is to them. That said, they do enjoy it. Although I think they are humoring me.",2008
9,"A fun and creative cartoon about a pair of step brothers who decide to make the most of everyday. Each day is filled with an outrageous scheme to have fun, each day topping the day before.

Their big sister is an average teen who tries to lead her own life, while trying to get her brothers in trouble for their schemes. The parents are charming and oblivious. The brother's friends are willing to go along for the ride. One girl in particular is lovestruck.

This is the only series in league of cartoon shows aired on Disney in recent times, which is not written down in the kids tone. The show characters and their stories are very well connected to each other. And the situations are so well thought of that each episode is fresh to watch. Candace's crush for Jeremy! and Dr. Doofenshmirtz's countless failed experiments and the hilarious reasons from his past life (mostly his childhood) are my favorite! Perry and Dr. Doofenshmirtz's conflict and strange friendship also adds good humor to the show. I'm 25 and I've been a dedicated viewer of the show and it has never failed to entertain me.",2014
10,"Serious Dan Povenmire and Swampy Marsh are geniuses. They managed to create a show that kids and adults would enjoy, with clever jokes and lovely characters. It's all about two stepbrothers spending their summer vacation building and doing innovative and wacky things with a teenage sister who always reports what the boys do to their mom, the boys own a platypus who is actually a secret agent that stops a mad scientist who has a teenage daughter and is divorced, the boys have many friends including a girl who is the leader of a girl guide group and they sometimes help the boys out on their wacky projects and she has a crush on Phineas. This show is quite funny and awesome and also has a song featured on nearly every episode. You know what's going to happen, but you don't know how it's going to happen.",2013

9,"When it comes to animation, I absolutely detest the latest trend of animating with 3D CGI or with Adobe Flash player as it seems so cheap and a real copp out. On top of that a majority of these shows have useless stories, horrible writing, idiotic images of an incoherent nature and some pretty disgusting attributes. So when I first watched this show I was quite sceptical of what I was going to see. But I was to be surprised, greatly surprised, this show is fantastic! Unlike it's peers, Phineas and Ferb has a good selection of humour which doesn't lend itself to repetitive themes or insufferable puns, nor does it lend itself to imagery that attempts to give obvious and dumb humour but fails at that as well. The jokes in this show are really quite clever and even make me chuckle.",2012
10,I started watching Phineas and Ferb during their debut month (entitled Phineas and Ferb-uary) There was a marathon at the end of the month in which they pretty much played all of the episodes up to that date. So I decided that I'd sit down and watch the whole thing.,2011
8,"just when i thought Disney channel should close due to all the live-action garbage they are selling to kids, this show came and redeemed it, this is actually one of the best shows i've seen in years, and the best family animated comedy since the first 3 spongebob seasons, this show has something for everyone and is very funny, from the two step brothers that are passing their summer by building all sorts of wacky gadgets and machines, to their teen sister trying to tell on them for their mother without success, to the kid's pet platypus who is a super agent whose job is to stop the plans on the local ""evil"" scientist, every caper is funny and hilarious (which is really hard thing to when the series depends on a formula that repeats itself, but they manage to keep every episode fresh and unpredictable). all i can say is leave all the dumb Disney channel ""sitcom"" and start watching this show with your family, it will be an awesome and great time!!!",2012

1,"When I watched the 1-2 seasons, I liked it until it got pointless. The music is overplayed and repetitive, the same band plays there terrible music in almost every episode and the humour sucks. I just want this terrible show to be over. The show also gets played too much. The idea of how these two ugly born children with the worlds most screwed up heads makes this ""great invention"" while there parents always leave the house for some pointless reason and there stupid annoying sister has to ""bust"" there brothers so there stupid Platypus has to always stop this annoying ""evil"" scientist Doctor Doofenshmirtz plan to take over the world, so he builds these stupid machine that always has a self destruct button, so every time Doofenshmirtz uses it, It makes the ""invention"" disappear. The word ""Bust"" is get so annoying and over used. Who the heck owns a Platypus, like thats seriously messed up. Danville and The ""Tri-state area"" is somehow a really big deal to everyone cause of these events that go on. I also don't get how the bully Buford was picking on Baljeet the nerd in seasons 1-2 and now Buford hangs out with these creeps. Isabella is so annoying when it comes to Phineas and Ferb. It's terribly planned out and the show is a wreck. Cancel it",2014
10,"While the songs were excellent and the episodes were great, those aren't the qualities that make Phineas and Ferb such an awesome show. What I love about this show is the message. I appreciate that the creators centered this series on the theme of carpe diem, and the kids made the most of every day of the summer that they had. Along with that, I also like the characters, especially the kids, as they are very likable. It's cool to see the kids reach for the stars every day, and set a good message to people watching. You never see the kids being mean, disrespecting their parents or anything. ",2015
9,"I remember when I first heard about this show back in 2007...on the ""High School Musical 2"" DVD...and when it aired, I really enjoyed it. Now, growing up, I wasn't dedicated to certain TV shows. Like it'll come on, I'd watch it, but I wouldn't consider myself a fan. However, this one I really enjoyed. I eventually stopped watching each new episode as it came out, I think I was around 8th or 9th grade, but I'd still watch it if nothing good was on. If you asked me what my favorite Disney show is...I'd say ""Darkwing Duck"". But if you asked me what my favorite original Disney show was I'd say ""Phineas and Ferb"". I enjoy it for its originality, its comedy, and its characters. (Oh yeah, this has nothing to do with the show itself, but I went to the Disney Store once and found a Perry the Platypus Whoopie Cushion. And I don't mean a whoopee cushion with Perry's face on it, no no no, I mean it's a Perry plush, with a whoopee cushion inside it, with the nozzle sticking out his butt. I bought it because it was so weird, and I made a joke that it was one of the things Phineas and Ferb did over summer vacation. ""Hey, Ferb, I know what we're going to do today! Let's shove a whoopee cushion up Perry's butt!"") If you're looking for an original TV show, look no further than ""Phineas and Ferb""!",2015

9,This is not Grey's anatomy. I think one of the most important you have to do in order to appreciate this show is to not compare it to Grey's Anatomy.,2007
8,"At first, I thought the show was just so-so, & I kept watching because I am a fan of the actors (Kate Walsh, Amy Brenneman, Tim Daly)... it was decent, but not as good as I had hoped. I kept watching to give it a chance, & I'm glad I did; the writing is still not ""great"", but it's getting better each week, & I like the fact that the characters are older & more mature (mostly) than on Greys. You shouldn't try to compare this show to Greys Anatomy too much though, as it portrays a different style & atmosphere- less surgery drama, different types of medicine & treatment of patients, less ""hosptial"" & more of an ""office"" atmosphere (obviously), etc. Mainly I like it because it seems to deal with issues that aren't only about ""who's sleeping with who this week"", although there are potential hookups for the future... I am now liking Private Practice more than Greys this season; the actors are great, & the writing is slowly getting into the groove... I'll definitely keep watching, & I hope people give it a chance for awhile.",2007
4,"It looks like the brilliant team of Shonda Rhimes outsourced the writing of this one somewhere offshore, maybe to the MediocreLand? ""PP"" reminds me any one of the many tedious, promising at first but predictable within 1 season David Kelly flicks (Picket Fences, Ally McBeal, and now Boston Legal). The crazy cases they get are so outlandish, they barely evoke sympathy or sadness. And that's what actually makes good medical dramas tick - dramatic situations you are afraid of, ""This could be me"" sentiment. They are not funny either.",2007
10,"This is a GREAT show.People need to just sit down and watch it without comparing it to Grey's Anatomy. It is a totally different show. The only reason the pilot aired the way it did was to basically let people know where Addison went and why. Other than that common factor there really isn't much the same about the two shows. But most of the time it is hilariously funny. The producers of this show-I believe- picked the perfect cast.They all mesh well together...like they are old friends who were meant to work together. And Addison is still as crazy as ever on this show, she just has men in her life that actually act like men instead of teenage boys. But really people just give this show a chance.You might be surprised and like it.",2008
3,"Private Practice is supposed to be a medical drama. So I guess my biggest complaint is the lack of originality in the medical story lines. Just by watching House, I ""solved"" two (out of nine) medical mysteries before the doctors did. Boooring. Seriously, if you are a lazy writer, why not copy some cases out of older ER episodes or some obscure Brazilian medical soap? House is recent and popular - recycling their ideas is hard to get away with...",2008
7,"I actually enjoy this show and I was doubtful when I heard about it. Has ANYONE worked in a place with friends and NOT had personal dramas? I doubt it. We all know it's there. The cast is incredible. There are some amazing performances by some very notable names. These are believable characters with believable faults and believable problems. It's humorous, dramatic and it pulls you into the stories. It's got heart wrenching stories without being far-fetched and odd, but believable cases. OK, it's not Grey's Anatomy, but let's face it. It wasn't meant to be.",2007
8,"It gets much, much better with time. Lame cliché, but true. Why is that? you may ask, well, first because it's getting a distance from GA. It's technically a spin off, but it's truly not. It's a brand new show with a character that USED TO BE on GA. Huge difference. Which, unfortunately, made the pilot/episode of GA almost un-watchable. It was really bad because we got a bunch of new characters tossed at us in two hours with a: this is the new show, like it! Almost impossible in those circumstances seeing as they are extremely different shows. So the first episode on it's own made me go: huh! better than I remembered. So distance: good.",2007
1,"Is this to show how women suck at work? Cause if this is it , they made a good job Private Practice is supposed to be a medical drama. So I guess my biggest complaint is the lack of originality in the medical story lines. Just by watching House, I ""solved"" two (out of nine) medical mysteries before the doctors did. Boooring. Seriously, if you are a lazy writer, why not copy some cases out of older ER episodes or some obscure Brazilian medical soap? House is recent and popular - recycling their ideas is hard to get away with...",2013
9,"Really great drama, that has everything that Grey's Anatomy doesn't. Great characters that are complex yet very relatable. Story line is always fresh and unpredictable. Each episode gets better and better. Definitely didn't have any expectations for this show since it was considered a spin off, but it's not like that at all. Nothing about it reminds me of Grey's except for Addison's character, who was great on Grey's and even better on this show. Not cheesy or over the top like Grey's can be, it reminds me of House but w/ more likable and interesting characters and better stories. If you haven't watched this show yet, catch up on old episodes online. This show puts Grey's to shame, especially this season. Hoping Private Practice makes it for another season.",2007
1,"Boredom can drive us to many things, and one of them is watching Private Practice. A so-called medical show, this is an hour with some very unpleasant, unlikable, annoying rich people who sleep with each other because no one else could tolerate them. So badly written, this show could fall into the comedy category for the Emmy's though one suspects the writers take themselves very seriously. Very seriously. Every week, this medical facility is faced with moral challenges that bring out the worst in one another, beginning with the truly absurd Dr. Naomi Bennett. Completely without a hint of charm or likability, this actors job is is to perpetually snarl at the daughter and the ex-husband, and now, the best friend. Second in line is Dr. Charlotte King, a character born out of the imagination of a sober Tennesee Williams. When she isn't spraying her female musk, she is chopping balls off her new husband, the docile Dr. Freedman. Even Taye Diggs character has recently entered into annoying territory as he ponders ethical and moral questions, usually shirtless. The real issue with this show is how bad the characters are and how as an audience, we could care less. At night, these horrible people retire to their beach-front Malibu properties to drink Chardonnay and engage in a game of sexual tick-tack-toe, only to wake each day and pretend they are doing something useful. If this were the show, at this point, the poignant sad folk-like song would be underscoring the deeply felt, overly dramatic moment that will happily lead to a commercial break.",2010
8,"This show has the potential to be great in the hands of better skillful writers. The set of veteran actors have all proved to have their acting chops, the writing however needs work.",2007
2,"I WAS a fan of Grey's and this show, and really wanted to be of ""Off the Map,"" but the formula that was initially great is now predictable and boring. I disagree with those who believe there is any ""difference."" Other than the locale of ""Off the Map,"" there is none. On the plus side for this show is a great cast, with little exception. Negatives--the story lines are no better than daytime TV (that's SOAP OPERAS), and the moral pontificating tedious. The series has so many unnecessary sub- plots (the ""Busy,""/""Captain""/lover-maid idiocy, with STUPID characters no less.) ",2011
3,"I have seen every episode of this spin off. I thought the first season was a decent effort considering the expectations of following such a success that is Grey's Anatomy. Thus i have continued to watch. I'm afraid the second season lacks the charm, the chemistry and more importantly the drama of it's predecessor Grey's Anatomy. The relationships seem contrived and the acting is so-so. The writing lacks the intelligence and comedic hints seen in GA. There are shows that a formulaic but do not feel formulaic and contrived, unfortunately PP is not so. I loved Kate Walsh's presence in GA. I'm afraid Kate Walsh's life in LA is simply not interesting.",2009
1,"And the title of this review is actually giving it a chance. The characters are blunt, yet overdone. There's no compelling storytelling, you lose interest 5 minutes into an episode and everything feels artificial. You can't connect with any of the characters because they are cheesy and beyond fictional. The actors feel plastic too, just like their characters. I do not understand how does one make a character driven drama and makes the characters boring and uninteresting. And to think that Off The Map was canceled (I am not a fan, it wasn't that good, but at least it had a good location) and this thing tortures people for 5 years. I can't possibly imagine how this thing survived for 5 seasons??? Who watches this thing? And what kind of a hospital is that? They sit and talk all the time, no one wears a white coat, but everybody is dressed like they are going to a wedding. I gave it a 2 only because I consider it the worst rating. Ah , I changed my mind, 1 my final rating.",2012
6,"I have been watching since the back door pilot, which should have warned me how the show was going to be. Even so there are such good actors on the cast that I ignored my initial impression of the slow, dragging storyline of Private Practice and watched anyway. I loved Amy B on Judging Amy and Kate Walsh was enjoyable enough on Grey's. I'm also a fan of Taye Diggs. Still there's something missing from the show. Its most upsetting for me to see Amy playing this sad woman, Violet? I'm not sure I enjoy that very much. This season's premiere just proves that even the best of actors can't make do with a so-so plot line. I know Shonda Rimes means well but I'm not interested so far. I guess I don't know where she's going with this. I'll still be watching and expecting more but only to see the actors I love suffering in their roles. Hopefully the writers will give them the gift of better storyline soon.",2008
1,"I've watched a few episodes of this show and have found certain elements of it to be rather interesting, considering medical facts that can be learned. But this is totally upstaged and wrecked by the neverending immoral relationships of the show's characters. Everybody seems to have slept with just about everyone, even during office hours, which is ridiculously unrealistic. There doesn't seem to be one solid, lasting marriage or relationship in the entire show - everyone is broken up and on the prowl - hardly a true reflection of all Americans. Indeed, there is a total lack of respect for marriage or monogamy and it's truly fulsome.",2009
5,"OK it's got the depth of a puddle and the nuance of an angry 15 year old girl. But that's the demographic sweet spot. I'm sure it's fine in that sense. You can't judge trash by the standards of anything other than trash and this is pretty good trash. OK so all the men are women and the women are insane. But only in that high school chick movie way. In the real world you'd run screaming for the doors if any of these borderline narcissists came at you with a scalpel or medical help. Assuming of course any of them could pull their respective genitals out of each other long enough to see patients. But so what? Oceanside Wellness careens from one improbable medical disaster to the next. And it always ends well or tragically. Which is the same as ending well. I feel that the only moral dilemma they left out was having a suicide bomber show up demanding to be artificially inseminated with the sperm of dead cloned Rabbi so she could go off and detonate in a glorious spectacle of female empowerment. Maybe they did that one. I forget. At any rate, give it watch. It's stupid mindless fluff that will leave you asking the TV whether they're retarded or you are. And the answer does not matter. I rate this a 5/10 because it aims for silly mediocrity and hits it perfectly.",2014
3,"""Private Practice"" is being spun off the fairly successful and well written ""Grey's Anatomy"". The cast is fabulous. The premise might even work. But the writing is just terrible.",2007
5,Yesterday's cake eating episode is a good example of the poor writing already cited here. There is hardly anything believable in these story lines. This set is far too drab for a California med clinic...IMO creating the wrong atmosphere. The actors are great...but everything seems too contrived...the material stinks. The ending of this episode was more like a sitcom.,2007
3,"The complaints are valid, to me the biggest problem is that this soap opera is too aimed for women. I am okay with these night time soaps, like Grey's Anatomy, or Ugly Betty, or West Wing, because there are stories that are interesting even with the given that they will never end. However, when the idea parallels the daytime soaps aimed at just putting hunky men (Taye Diggs, Tim Daly, and Chris Lowell) into sexual tension and romps, and numerous ridiculous difficult situations in a so-called little hospital, it seems like General Hospital...or a female counterpart to Baywatch. That was what men wanted and they had it, so if this is what women want so be it, but the idea that this is a high brow show (or something men will watch) is unrealistic.",2007
5,"If I had written this review five days ago I would have given it a rating of ""10"" and not ""5"". Why the change? Because during the five days the cumulative effect of watching several more episodes that promote a ""pro-life"" attitude has pushed me over the peak: from addictively watching the show to being astounded and appalled that such a seemingly sophisticated show is so insidiously pushing a point of view.",2011
10,"This is by far the most unusual movie I have ever seen. I am a die hard Sci-Fi buff and found myself wondering why no one has released a movie like this before. I was totally engrossed... the story pulled me in like a Black Hole, I found myself wanting more and more.",2007
10,I cannot speak about the depth and art put forth in this film without giving away details that will rob enjoyment from you if you have not seen this film. Suffice it to say that I highly recommend this film for anyone who enjoys a film that reaches to the stars and does not depend on CGI.,2007
10,"A seriously engaging film with a small twist at the end. Lots of small inputs of educational facts and figures but stay alert as they come quick and fast. I thought the mix of characters was excellent and the tale outstanding, but that is down to Bixby the writer. The acting was a little wooden but the story-line was fast enough (after a slightly slow start) to save dwelling on this. A sci-fi film with absolutely no special effects, relying solely on the story and a room-full of actors.",2007
10,"I, too, saw this movie at San Diego Comic-Con 2007, and was incredibly happy that I did. I would, however, in no way consider this a thriller, as another reviewer did. This is a movie to provoke deep thought and conversation and that dares to challenge mainstream beliefs. It is one of the most intensely engaging dramas that I have had the pleasure to see. Excellent ensemble performances created believably real characters, each with his or her own fallibilities, personal credo, and enthusiasms.",2007
10,"Jerome Bixby's ""The Man from Earth"" stands proudly among the best science fiction films ever made. However, unlike ""2001"", ""CE3K"" and ""Blade Runner,"" this little movie relies not on outstanding set design and mind-blowing visual effects, but rather on ideas; the very foundation of science fiction.",2007
10,"If not the ""best"" science-fiction film ever made, Jerome Bixby's Man From Earth is certainly one of the most thoughtful. This movie reminds me of Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Not with spaceships and effects, but with intelligent characters and exceptional dialogue, and that it left me with a sense of true wonder and joy, long after the credits ended. If the movie had been two hours longer I still would not have been bored, even though most of the film takes place in one small room. It's like watching a ninety minute Twilight Zone, with a perfect surprise ending. John Billingsly stands out, as does David Lee Smith, who may or may not be a caveman. The rest of the cast is good, but the script is the true star. And to anyone claiming this film is boring because we never leave the one room; Some of the very best Twilight Zones were just that. Good actors, good scripts, one or two locations. To anyone who's fed up with spaceships and explosions and Jar-Jar Binks, see this movie as a reminder of what science fiction has always been about.",2007

When he and my father (Emerson Bixby)would talk about It, I could see A glow in both their eyes and knew something special was coming. This movie represents the true art of science fiction and I believe It will surprise allot of people on how many different ways entertainment can form itself. It Is well put together and scripted. Great cast...(GREAT) cast. Directer was great and most off all. The man who made sure my grandfather's story never died, Mr Emerson Bixby who I'm positive will bring us fun and interesting films for years to come.",2007
10,"This is a brilliant tale and a writers triumph over the thirst of hearing a good story! At first i was not sure of what a was to expect from the movie but like the characters i was drawn into the story. As the film goes on it shorter to the end, i don't under stand why it is necessary to write ten lines about the film, i just wanted to say a few words about it. I don't think it will do very well in the cinema because most people don't appreciate a good story for just that. They want to see some action in the film, but this film does not have much of that in the physical sense,but maybe in the intellectual :) grate movie....",2007
9,"Hi this is my first comment on any movie but i was compelled to write this. The man from earth was the best film i have seen this year in the terms of originality. It may not be action packed but it makes up for this in intrigue,it kept me watching and is a must see for genuine movie buffs.The acting at the first couple of minutes had me a little worried but after that i thought the film flowed and it soon eased my worries i am notorious to friends for giving up on movies before they begin.I would not recommend this film for kids it would be more suited to anyone over the age of 25 but hey what do i know you can make up your own mind by watching it in the cinemas",2007

10,"I recently had the opportunity to view Man From Earth at the Comic-Con Film Festival, and it was amazing. The Sci-Fi thriller goes places I've never dreamed of. The movie places the viewer in the backseat for a wild ride through history connecting it to the present. I was shocked at the ideal of a Cro-Magnum surviving until present day, and even more shocked how each professional almost validated the possibilities as the story unfolded. The most unique thing about the movie is who John Oldman has met, and has been (don't want to give it away, but he's been the most well known person alive) in his centuries of living, or who he could be in the future!

1,"If I could vote for a less than zero, this one would definitely deserve it. There is NO, and I mean NOT ONE, excuse for producing such a bad movie. Was it due to the low budget?

1,"I'm sorry, this was like watching a horrible community theater production. The acting was melodramatic and ""stagey"" and the dialogue was atrocious. There was no chemistry or connection between the actors and they all seemed like they were desperate to ""act"" rather than live truthfully in the given circumstances. Acting 101 was not observed. It's possible that it was due to bad direction. I could almost hear the director saying,""You should be really angry here.""... ""Ok, that take was good but can you be angrier?"". Really bad stuff. That said, I respect anyone who completes a project but I just think that if you're gonna do it, do it well.",2010

10,"It's been a really long time since I saw a movie that captured me, mind and soul, that much. Even since the very beginning, when the whole concept of the movie (a 14,000 old man?) seems too fictional, you can sense the difference in the atmosphere, the escalating emotions, and the question keeps pop into your mind: ""could it be actually true?"" And the fact that everything is taking place in a small living room in front of a fire place among a small group of people -like in the theatre- makes it even more special. It is certainly one of the movies that will provoke endless discussions. Some may hate it due to the controversial issues that it is dealing with, but if you watch it with an open mind, you cannot but admit that ""everything is possible"". After all what is history and religion other than our current knowledge of what happened thousand of years ago and how it was captured through the eyes and hands of other people. Even the science that we know today is just a way to interpret the natural phenomena with the knowledge that we currently hold, knowing pretty well that if the situations change or new discoveries will be made then we will have to discard the old knowledge and adopt the new one. Overall I believe the movie is truly ingenious and mind challenging and I strongly recommend it to those who keep seeking alternative answers to long standing questions that are dealing with history, religion, science!",2007

7,"Obviously a big-budget, flashy musical remake of a John Waters film is never going to be as subversive or as comically edgy as its predecessors, but one of the good things about HAIRSPRAY is that it never intends to be. It fully embraces the cheesy, over-the-top aspect of a movie musical from frame one, a trait that most other current films of its type try to avoid. In a welcome change from the summer drudgery of explosions and CGI, this film is a pure feel-good crowd pleaser where excitement and energy rise above all.",2007
8,"Not that I'm surprised that I liked it but yes that I liked it as much as I did. Keeping some of the lovely John Water garishness but mainstreaming it enough to make it mainstream. John Travolta in the Divine part is truly divine. He went for it and played it for real. I thought it was actually moving at times and the illusion works, beautifully. Michelle Pfeiffer opening a new chapter in her career, the thin as a rail, gorgeous, middle age bitch. Great fun to watch. Christopher Walken, adorable. I had hoped a bigger splash of a dance number between Travolta and Walken - after all they were playing husband and wife in a musical and when are we going to see that again. Their moments together are, how can I put it? Nice, very nice. Nikki Blonsky inherits Riki Lake's oversize heroine with gusto and lots of energy. Allison Jenney, as usual, steals every moment she's in. Alas, far too few, and John Waters plays a quick cameo as a Baltimore flasher. What else do you want out of life.",2007

10,"I just saw Hairspray the movie at the 5th Avenue Theater in Seattle--the same theater where Hairspray the musical premiered five years ago. It could be that I am just dizzied by the dashing good looks of Zac Efron, but the magic that was produced on stage by the original Hairspray cast has transfered flawlessly to the big screen.",2007
9,"As a fan of the stage musical, I was worried that the film might not measure up - but they hit this one out of the ballpark! Bright, bouncy and joyously hilarious! A big smile hit my face as soon as it started and I didn't stop grinning until the end of the credits.",2007
10,"So far I've seen this movie twice and both times the audience was involved 100%. ""Hairspray: The Musical"" is the definition of a feel good movie.",2007
10,"My family and I saw the movie version of the Broadway musical adaptation of John Waters' 1988 comedy HAIRSPRAY on its opening weekend. It's unanimous: this HAIRSPRAY is a big, bright, joyful 1960s song-and-dance extravaganza, and we all urge you to run out and see it right this minute! Go ahead, I'll wait right here... :-) My little girl loves music and dancing, but she still tends to like animated films better than live-action films, so when she got into HAIRSPRAY from the start, dancing joyfully in her seat to the Phil Spector-style opening number, ""Good Morning, Baltimore,"" I knew this movie was truly something special. Lest you think this HAIRSPRAY has forgotten its roots, the opening number also features Waters in a hilarious cameo as a flasher. Also, watch for Ricki Lake, the original HAIRSPRAY's original Tracy, as a talent agent in the climactic ""Miss Hairspray"" sequence, as well as Jerry Stiller, Tracy's dad in the original, playing The Hefty Hideaway's head honcho. HAIRSPRAY is the kind of movie musical that GREASE should have been back in the 1970s (yes, it was a huge box-office hit, but I always thought it had a cold, calculating air to it, plus it was so obvious that the teenage characters were being played by stars pushing 30), making it all the more appropriate that John Travolta should carry on the Divine tradition of a man playing mama Edna Turnblad in drag, without *being* a drag. Travolta is great fun to watch, a delightful surprise with his sensitive performance (even if his Baltimore accent is a little off  but maybe that's just because Baltimore is played by Toronto :-)) as insecure caterpillar-turned-butterfly Edna; this is no cheap, brassy drag-queen turn. The very convincing fat F/X makeup and prosthetics (Edna may be overweight, but she's got womanly curves in all the right places) don't get in the way of fleet-footed Travolta's fabulous dancing. Adorable newcomer Nikki Blonsky lights up the screen in all her scenes as Tracy Turnblad, the perky dynamo who won't let her plus-size body or the sneers of Amber Von Tussle (Brittany Snow) and the other so-called cool kids keep her from dancing her way onto Baltimore's American BANDSTAND manque, THE CORNY COLLINS SHOW. Tracy and her shy bud Penny Pingleton (Amanda Bynes) become socially aware as they befriend the black kids from the ""wrong"" side of town, fighting against bigoted station manager and stage mother Velma Von Tussle (Michelle Pfeiffer, having a blast slinking around making trouble) to integrate the show instead of relegating their new friends to the program's monthly ""Negro Day."" The plot's serious aspects, with its foreshadowing of the era's more sobering issues, are woven deftly into the movie's high spirits. The jubilant dance numbers, Marc Shaiman's catchy music and Scott Wittman's snappy lyrics are performed with bubbly abandon by each and every cast member. As the Dick Clark-ish Corny Collins, James Marsden proves that Hugh Jackman isn't the only X-Man with range and musical talent. I've never watched HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL, but it's easy to see why Zac Efron, winning Tracy's heart as Link Larkin, has won audiences' hearts, too. Efron is alluring enough to make teenage girls squeal while coming across as wholesome enough not to panic parents, plus he doesn't seem to take himself too seriously. Indeed, there were Zac Efron fans in our theater who shrieked and giggled with joy every time he appeared on screen! Christopher Walken reminds us that before he was an eccentric Oscar-winning character actor, he was a hell of a dancer. As Tracy's supportive joke-shop proprietor dad, Walken has winsome chemistry with Travolta in their duet, ""You're Timeless to Me."" (You haven't lived until you've seen Walken and Travolta make like Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers!) The funny, endearing Bynes is better served here than she's been in her previous movies; maybe she should seek out more ensemble pieces like this one. Bynes also has terrific chemistry with Elijah Kelley as Seaweed, who combines Denzel Washington's playful side with James Brown's moves; I'd love to see Kelley get even bigger and better roles. As Seaweed's mom, Motormouth Maybelle, Queen Latifah is saintly yet sassy, gliding effortlessly between belting out ""Big, Blonde, and Beautiful"" and bringing tears to my eyes with her soulful ballad ""I Know Where I've Been"" during the protest march. BTW, Bynes isn't the only Nickelodeon alumnus in HAIRSPRAY; director and choreographer Adam Shankman also choreographed ROUNDHOUSE, one of our favorite Nick shows from the early 1990s. Leslie Dixon adapted Waters' original screenplay, keeping the sly, subversive elements while also keeping things bouncy and upbeat. HAIRSPRAY is a great big sunny summer movie that'll put a smile on your face, a song on your lips, and a shimmy in your shake!",2007

10,"So I just went to a sneak peak of Hairspray this morning and was I pleasantly surprised. As a huge fan of Hairspray the stage show and of music theatre in general, this could be my favorite movie musical (Chicago, Rent, Phantom, Dreamgirls). The cast was for the most part quite stellar. Nikki Blonsky was one terrific Tracy. Very surprised and impressed with Amanda Bynes as well as Zac Effron. Elijah Kelley was impressive as Seaweed as well. John Travolta was very funny and was a great dancer (even in heals). Love Christopher Walkin's performance as well. Michelle Pfeiffer was a great evil Velma (although her singing was the weakest of the movie). Queen Latifah was PERFECT in this role, got to love her! The story lines altered from the stage show some (don't worry I won't spoil anything). But the differences were not distracting; the movie still made wonderful sense and had a great flow. Although I was bummed that several songs were cut, the ones that were kept in were sensational. Of special note were ""I Can Hear the Bells,"" ""Welcome to the 60's,"" ""I Know Where I've Been,"" and ""Without Love."" These movie musicals just keep getting better and better. I can't wait for Sweeny Todd this Christmas!!!",2007
10,"What an amazing journey for this property. From the original low budget film, to a glitzy stage musical, to this phenomenal motion picture. At each stage creativity and pizazz was added to a solid story. I've seen it twice, and enjoyed it just as much the second time. Wanted to applaud several times, and threw my lot 100% into the plot. Life's too short to not enjoy such perfection. I was never a big fan of Travolta, but that he would even attempt such a role -- and pull it off with aplomb -- moves him way up on my list. Other veterans and newcomers shine. Can't wait to buy this one on DVD, but please pack it with extras and interviews!",2007
10,"I was so impressed with this movie!!! I mean I'd heard of Hairspray the musical 2 years ago when I got the soundtrack from a friend and from then on I was in love!! When I heard they were making a movie last fall I'm like I have to see this!! I nearly drove my family insane by being so excited and checking this IMDb often. Finally tonight I got to see it and the wait was worth it!! Perfect casting!! John Travolta was the best Mama and he sure danced up a storm. Another thing - the choreography was perfect too - absolutely amazing on everyone's part. A couple of the songs weren't how I pictured they would be in my head but they still worked out amazing. Now cutting a musical down to a movie means there has to be some song cutting but I think they did it in an effective way and a couple of them appear in the credits and on the soundtrack from what I understand. The movie kept me laughing the entire time, except during one song(which I won't say here) made me almost come to tears. A really great movie that I can't wait to see again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again.....",2007
10,"I saw older versions of the movie and also the play (in both pre-Broadway and Broadway versions). As great as they all were, this 2007 movie was even better! The audience in my movie house certainly seemed to agree. Virtually everyone in the theatre applauded when the movie was over (unusual here in subdued Seattle)and about a dozen people actually gave the moving a STANDING ovation (I can't recall seeing that here). I would highlight a specific performer, but it would be very difficult since they were all terrific, from the leads to the smaller role players. The music was sensational (I wanted to buy a CD, but the theatre said they had sold out), and there wasn't a dull minute in the movie. I'd put this movie right up there (and in my opinion a bit ahead) of other ""classics"" of this genre like ""Grease,""""Bye Bye Birdie"" and the more recent ""Chicago"" and ""Dreamgirls"" (all of which I thought were excellent). We went with 2 other couples, the men of which told me they ""hated musicals,"" but they loved this picture and they actually raved about it the rest of the evening. I'd really worry about someone who didn't enjoy and have fun at this ""Hairspray!"" I'm serious!!",2007
10,"Just got back from the premiere and this was an amazing movie. I wasn't expecting it to be comparable to the Broadway but it was amazing. The casting was really well done, the sets were very well decorated. Costumes were impressive. Travolta was an excellent Edna. It is definitely worth seeing. Laugh your head off funny. Music and performances had everybody in the theater dancing or tapping their feet. If you want to have fun, go see this movie. You will dance all the way home. I think this will be one of the better movies of the summer and definitely deserves a few awards. I can't wait for it to be released so I can bring all my friends and family.",2007
4,"I have to buck the trend here...it seems the world is full of Hairpray fans...but I am not one of them. I loved the 1988 version because it was camp and over the top, and deliciously subversive...but the latest offering is a diluted, lifeless affair that tries to hard to be the next Grease; has songs with little or no singalong quality; is vaguely offensive in its handling of serious issues, and basically offers the audience nothing new. I can remember when Grease came out how everyone rushed out to have the soundtrack - you were something of a social outcast at school if you did not own the album. Will the same sort of buzz be generated by the latest soundtrack to Hairspray? I very much doubt it. The songs are noisy, cluttered, unoriginal and ...stale. I wanted so much to like this film...I really did...but left the cinema thinking I had wasted my time and money. Divine was loud and brash, camp and offensive - Travolta's performance is too coy and restrained to make his character as appealing or memorable. I kept watching to see if he and Chris walken would kiss, but, like the rest of this diluted movie, it appears nobody had to the balls to eat up their roles with relish or conviction ... there is loads of scope to go completely over the top, yet every character comes across as being too scared to be larger than life...as if they tried to make the most inoffensive movie they could..and succeeded. I much preferred the brashy, trashy '88 version.",2007
3,"I love the original film, and I enjoyed the songs from the Broadway musical, but had real qualms about what was done to the plot. And unfortunately the film bears out my fears: this has to be the sloppiest, most incoherent plot ever put on celluloid. The lapses in logic are appalling: ""Robot Monster"" makes more sense! Characterization is beyond minimal, it's practically non-existent. The characters of Link and Amber barely exist; at least Link has a song or two, but they aren't character songs. Amber has, what, five lines? Some of these are problems carried over from the show, which is a shame, since the songs could easily be plugged into the original with little adapting (except for cutting that lousy ""Miss Baltimore Crabs"" number). A missing song, ""Mama, I'm a Big Girl Now,"" would have given Amber and Penny something interesting to do. One nice change was made to the finale, but generally the song's impact is dissipated by dialogue interruptions and pointless, unfunny slapstick. John Travolta is practically unintelligible, Christopher Walken is inaudible. Direction is scattershot as well, and the choreography is not up to snuff.",2007
1,"As originally created by John Waters in 1988, HAIRSPRAY was the tale of an overweight 1960s teenager who successfully crashes a small time T.V. dance program--only to find herself in the midst of a battle between segregationists and integrationists. In 2002 it was transformed into a Broadway musical which in turn became this big screen musical in 2007. But where the 1988 film was hilariously subversive, the 2007 film is akin to watching re-runs of The Lawrence Welk Show while snacking on white bread and mayonnaise.",2008
10,"I just came back from an early screening of Hairspray and i must say i was blown away. I was a fan of both the original movie and the Broadway show. I wasn't sure what to expect from the director of such cinematic wonders such as ""Brinin' down the house"" and ""Cheaper by the dozen 2""...not. From director of those i was expecting crap. Boy Was I Wrong! The movie is nonstop fun from start to finish. From the beginning when cute Nikki Blonsky begins singing the opening number till the cast sings and dances their way to the ending. Nikki Blonsky was the perfect choice for the bubbly Tracy Turnblad. John Travolta was A Riot as Edna Turnblad. You love love love Edna by the end of the movie when she dances her way across the stage on the CC show. Elijah Kelly was perhaps one of the most impressive in the cast. His constant energy was so entertaining. I wasn't sure i'd like Amanda Bynes, but I Loved Her! She was perfect for the role, they couldn't have chosen anybody better. Queen Latifah and James Marsden were absolutely amazing as they host the Corny Collins Show. Queen's show-stopping number had people in the audience applauding enthusiastically. Michelle Pfieffer and Brittany Snow presented the perfect villains. Christopher Walken was, as usual, hilarious! Those in smaller roles such as Taylor parks and Allison Janney all shined in their specific moments.",2007
10,"i just got home from a sneak peak showing........ so i have seen the original and the Broadway show and was nervous about this one, but it was so good, like watching the actual show but up close!!! i will absolutely go see it again!! the only thing i wish was kept was mama i'm a big girl now, you only hear it in the credits......but i love the new songs (especially Zac's ""Ladies Choice""!!) and the entire cast did a really good job!!! Amanda is great as Penny, and her and Seaweed are so hysterical together!!! Zac as link was perfect...although it was a little awkward seeing him kiss Nikki, who by the way could not have done a better job as Tracy, i wasn't sure when i heard that they were having this well know cast with a complete nobody as the lead, but she definitely earned it!! Also.....John Travolta as Edna is super funny, but when he sings i couldn't help but think...""i didn't know Dannny Zuko was in the movie."" but he pulled it off!!",2007

10,"I saw the Toronto premiere last night, and i was amazed! I'm just gonna give an analysis of some of the main actors Nikki Blonsky (Tracy Turnblad) - A brilliant debut, her enthusiasm makes u feel all excited, and it may seem that her attitude in the film is rather corny; you can't help but feel the same way when she sings. Her infatuation for Link Larkin (Zac Efron) was adorably and cheekily cute (and I think any teenage girl such as myself, would agree that he is rather cute :P) John Travolta (Edna Turnblad) - An amazing return to the musicals for Travolta, especially in drag! Edna's side-splitting obsession over food is hilarious to watch, and you will be in stitches just looking at his posterior, amazing acting by Travolta! Michelle Pfeiffer (Velma Von Tussle) - Great acting as the ""baddie"" of the film, her rising anger is so funny to watch, and her wickedness draws you into her character so much you can hardly believe it. Brilliant! Amanda Bynes (Penny Pingleton) - great role as the lead's best friend, her growing relationship with Seaweed Stubbs is hilarious and her innocence is so striking you can't help but fall in love with it and the rest of her lollipop-sucking character Zac Efron (Link Larkin) - the heartthrob of the movie can really make you fall in love with his charm, trademark hair, wink and dancing. You also love his good nature, as he favours the segregation protest for black people. Seeing as Efron is extremely popular with young women, casting him as the heart-throb of the movie pulls off really well. Falling in love with Tracy Turnblad is a rather cheesy storyline, yet it is still believable enough and this blends in well with the nature of this film. Amazing acting by Efron, he was cast so well for this film and this will ensure his future in film will be extremely successful (besides...he's hot :P).On hearing him say the word ""ass"" in this film removes his vulnerable High School Musical teen aspect, and makes him a real man, brilliant acting from him :) Overall, a brilliant film to watch, I'd definitely recommend it comedy/musical fans. This feel-good film is a MUST for anyone ♥ :)",2007
9,"It was a great joy to watch this come to life for the 3rd time. I'm a huge fan of the original John Waters film (spoiler - blink and you will miss his cameo). Nikki is so adorable you will instantly fall in love with her. Travolta, who is so hard to take in the trailers, really grows on you after about 10 minutes. The weakest link is actually the kid from High School Musical, Zac something.....I saw the musical on Broadway as well, I think it follows that plot line pretty closely, I don't remember any differences in the story, if there were some they were minor. The casting was pitch perfect. The entire film a delight. I thing this film is going to get lost amongst the big summer blockbusters. The test audience I was with enjoyed it, clapped a lot, cheered and seemed to be having a ton of fun. It's a lot lighter than Chicago and Dreamgirls, just to compare it to recent movie musicals.",2007

10,"Remember how everyone was talking about Toy Story when it first came out? The incredible visuals, unique style, vividly imagined world? The next time people were talking that way with such enthusiasm about a computer animated movie was Finding Nemo. I'm excited to say that Ratatouille will be the next one to redefine the visual creativity and technical detail of computer animated movies. Honest to goodness, I was awestruck by the animation, and that never happens to me. It is a visual masterpiece of a movie if ever the term applies.",2007
10,"Tonight I went to see Ratatouille during a preview offered to Myspace users in Boston. Overall the movie was GREAT! It was really funny, often in unexpected places, the storyline kept you engaged the entire time and the overall mood was lighthearted and inspiring. A real ""feel-good"" movie. I admit I was a bit skeptical going in, I mean the idea of a rat in a kitchen kind of left me queasy, but I left the theater excited to see it again when it is released. The voice actors are excellent and the animation is amazing. I've been to Paris before and the overall views were very accurate. At times I could tell exactly where in the city the events were taking place. Overall a fabulous movie, I highly recommend it!",2007

10,Fantastic ! ... Can't wait to get the DVD ! The technical / animation / lighting ..etc aspects of the film are awesome. Pixar has raised the bar again.,2007
10,"I caught a sneak peak yesterday, and must say, this film is a classic. It is not as flashy as cars, or as action packed as Incredibles, but it is a masterpiece of restraint and heart, that matches the classics from the golden age of the film industry. Pixar has always been groundbreaking for smart and fun animated features, but Ratatouille might just be what puts them over the top as one of the BEST all around film-making teams in history.",2007
10,"This film is fantastic! Pixar has yet another great film to add to their impressive repertoire. Oscar-winning director and screenwriter Brad Bird, who wrote and directed ""The Incredibles"", has produced a film with subtle humor, heart, and very profound truth. The voice actors are so great, and it is especially great to hear Peter O'Toole on the screen. The animation is beautiful and it is all around an excellently made film. Its message is one that holds so much truth for everyone, especially today's youth: it tells people that no, not anyone can do anything, but if you have the talent you don't have to be limited by your surroundings or your upbringing. I think this is refreshing to hear because often, children are lied to when they are told they can do anything, when actually not all of them can. But it offers hope to the ones who may feel limited by their social class. It also exposes the fact that most people try to put up false facades of themselves to hide who they are in order to feel accepted by the social standards we create in our society; it shows characters with this flaw, but ultimately they accept this reality and learn to be true to themselves. This thread, I think, is very common throughout the Pixar films, and they present it very well. ""Ratatouille"" is my new Disney-Pixar favorite! ""Ce film a pleine de joie de vivre!""",2007
10,"The combination of Disney and Pixar never ceases to amaze, but with Ratatouille, their newest effort, animated features are brought to new heights with the best one to date. Ratatouille is stunning, surreal while at the same time realistic, and a joy to watch. The writing is, in one word, just amazing, and the voice acting is sensational. The characters are poetic and real, and the rats are some of Disney/Pixar's cutest creations. Ratatouille is written and directed by Brad Bird (The Incredibles), and features stellar voice acting from Peter O'Toole, Patton Oswalt, Ian Holm, Brian Dennehy, Lou Romano, Brad Garrett, and Janeane Garofalo.",2007
10,"I saw this movie in the sneak preview, and I just loved it! You will be amazed by its creativity and brilliance. I would easily vote it to be the best animation movie ever beating nemo, cars, monster inc, etc by a mile! This movie is for people of all age groups. Kids, adults and even those who do not like animations will love it.",2007
9,"I just saw ""Ratatouille"" tonight.",2007
9,"I attended a sneak preview of Ratatouille, and I have to say, Pixar has done it again. I enjoyed Cars, but didn't LOVE it like some of the other Pixar Films (Monsters Inc and The Incredibles are my favorites). This movie, however, was just about perfect. If I had one complaint (and it's VERY small) it was a just a little too long, but not by much. But the voices, the computer animation, the music, and above all the story were all top notch. I'm continually amazed at how Pixar continues to crank out great films like these that both children and adults can appreciate. I have a feeling most critics and film goers alike will rate this one very high. I wholeheartedly recommend the film - it really was a fun night out at the movies! Congrats Pixar!! Oh, and they also continue to do wonderful shorts that appear before the feature. This one involving aliens(that's all I'll say) is really cute and continues that fine tradition.",2007
10,To me this is one of the best animated movies of the last years. It has a very inspiring story and has a timeless signature. It has many comedy elements but is not overloaded with jokes that make reference to the present time (like Shrek).,2007
10,"At this point, Brad Bird is no longer making great animated movies -- he's making great movies, end of sentence.",2007
7,"Ratatouille is a major step up from a lot of last year's animated fare, and a vast improvement from last year's Oscar winner for best animated feature. Here we re-discover sweet simplicity amped up with the expected story-telling techniques of Pixar, and here's the kicker, no heavy handed messages hammered in with a drill, but there certainly is a message and it's delivered with subtler grace despite some flaws. Although, aspects to the message are borderline confusing if you over analyze the reality that occurs in the film, but the film doesn't scream for over-analyzation in the same fashion as ""Finding Nemo"". For me, the animation slightly overpowers the story, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. The film is directed, camera-wise, with the same interesting techniques as ""Happy Feet"", but the film has more in store. We get to see the world mainly from Remmy's perspective, and it's visually exciting. The camera-work is what makes the film's physical humor work so well. More on the artistic scheme, the film looks really great. Particularly the lighting stands out. The colors are very lush and detailed; very accurate toward a real city-scape. Then the rat's fur are very impressive, it moves against the wind and gets wet very much like real rat hair. Don't let the detail in the clothes get past you either. The film manages to find a balance between superficial realism and animated characters. The character designs for the humans are marvelous (Bird seems to get much humor out of the smaller villains as seen in the past ""Incredibles"" and the non-Pixar film ""Shrek"") and the rats, while moving a lot like real rats still have acceptable personalities and animated form. So we feel like we're entering an animated world that is fleshy and real. Speaking of such, other animated marvels are the organic forms of the food. As real as the food in the film is, the film rightfully capture the spirit of the plot it pursues. It introduces the viewer into the world of fine-dinning and develops something rare in today's animation, a bleeding heart.",2007
10,"My only regret is that I let this movie slip by without seeing it on the big screen. It's not even playing in those cheap theaters that charge a buck after the movie has been out for a while. I picked up the DVD and watched it 3 times. Remy is adorable and I fell in love with him ,his facial expressions and body language are so sweet, you care what happens to him,there is one scene where he is trapped in a jar and Linguini is going to drop him in the water,you can see the fear in his eyes and how vulnerable he is,it pulls at your heart and you want to just rescue him and take him into your arms. Once the kitchen show gets going though it really rocks.. Linguini is hilarious and Colette a wonderful tough lady chef who falls in love with Linguini. Hijinks in the kitchen as both Remy and Linguini pull off the most hilarious illusion of cooking with Remy pulling his hair to make him do things and Linguini's incredible Jim Caerryesque slapstick bodygags. The supporting cast is equally marvelous with various big stars doing voiceovers like Brian Dennehy ,Peter O'Toole and others adding to it's charm. I'm usually OK with most animated Disney movies that have come out lately but this one really moved me and I'm a 42 y/o man. It was very adult in nature since it appealed more to the older crowd then just kids. I do hope they do a sequel as I would most like to see what happens to Remy next. Bravo Brad Bird and the cast and crew . 10 out of 10",2008

8,"Ratatouille, Brad Bird's third feature (after the scintillating Iron Giant and The Incredibles) measures up to his oeuvre. It's a fine film with wonderful animation, a charming story, and a slam bang finale that had me laughing. The story, in brief, is that Remy the Rat has the dream (and the talented nose) to be a great chef. Through a series of misadventures, he finds himself in the kitchen of Gusteau's, a former five-star restaurant now clicking over on the reputation of its deceased former owner, the great chef Gusteau, whose ghost (or else figment of Remy's imagination) is mentor to Remy. Remy develops a relationship with the hapless Linguini, a garbage boy in the kitchen with a secret past, and through him begins to return the restaurant to its greatness. ",2007
10,"Okay, I admit, I haven't seen an animated film in a theatre in a long time...but when I saw the previews for this I thought it looked cute, had nothing else to do, bought a ticket and went in and saw it. I was extremely pleased with what I saw. The animation was great...the characters were cute. (What can I say? I have a fondness for rats, I had a pat rat myself when I was younger). It almost had an ""American Tail"" feel at the beginning. Delightful to watch, and some really funny parts in it. The kids will love this, and if it's doesn't win an award for best animated feature, something is definitely wrong with the Academy.",2007
10,"When ""Ratatouille"" (2007) was released last summer, I was not too eager to see the animated 106 minutes long film about a rat in a kitchen of a five-star Parisian restaurant. The idea seemed too original and brave for my taste. As film had been shown all over the world, I kept reading and hearing only great reviews for it. Then, my brother who usually does not get exited about any movie, told me that ""Ratatouille"" was absolutely charming, captivating, funny and moving at the same time, and the most charming about it was Remy, a rat, ""little chef"" with huge talent in the fine art of cooking. I saw the movie last weekend and I am happy to agree with my brother completely. ""Ratatouille"" has everything for every viewer to enjoy - technical excellence, amazing colors, highly original images, and the voices that matched the characters perfectly. The film is a clever satire and the moving story that will be interesting for the adults and children alike. Where the movie succeeds admirably - in showing on the screen the process of cooking which can be as inspiring and creative as painting, writing, or composing the music: ""How can I describe it? Good food is like music you can taste, color you can smell. There is excellence all around you. You need only to be aware to stop and savor it."" Speaking of how the movies sometimes affect our life - after we saw ""Ratatouille"" together with my husband, he demanded that I cooked him a Ratatouille that would take him back to his happy childhood days and rock him to his core just like the one that Remy prepared for a ""grim eater"", the universally feared food critic Anton Ego.",2008
10,"The greatest test of whether or not a film is truly admirable is how well it holds up years after its release. It has been almost three years since Ratatouille has been released and I have now seen it at least four times, maybe more. I am proud and thrilled to say that it has not lost any of its charm, still looks amazing and holds up better than almost any film I've seen as many times as I've seen this.",2008
10,"The Pixar juggernaut continues! I've always been enthralled by the movies that Pixar puts out ever since Toy Story, and through the years, Pixar has built a brand of trust amongst movie goers, with quality storytelling using animation as a tool to tell them, not because it's cool to do things through the medium, but that it adds a certain powerful, believable dimension, with stories rooted to universal themes, yet jazzed up by the structure in which it's told. The Incredibles ranked amongst my favourite so far, but writer-director Brad Bird has topped that with Ratatouille, a story about a rat, and probably the most mature of the Pixar stories to date.",2007
8,"I may get some flak for this, but here goes. I ranked Ratatouille third best ever in Pixar movies. It may be because I'm older, but that doesn't mean it isn't a good movie. The voices are good, the animation is stellar like all Pixar movies, and the jokes appeal to me. But it doesn't have the hilarious supporting actor/voice, like in Finding Nemo with Dory (my absolute favourite Pixar movie ever), and The Incredibles (E). Emile and Linguini just don't have that funny flair like Dory and E did. In Finding Nemo and The Incredibles, I found myself saying memorable quotes a lot (Dory speaking whale and E showing Helen the new suits). Ratatouille had me with none of these, except for the one from the trailer (Don't just hork it down!). Overall, 8/10. To rank it perfect is not true, and to give it anything less than 8 should be a sin. Also, what may have made it bad, was this annoying woman behind, laughing at the most unfunny things in the movie.",2007
8,"This is a great film. Pixar has done it again, in a silly, serious, very fun way. The animation is top-notch. I agree with other posters that the scenery is extremely well done. The colors are magnificent, especially the sunsets in Paris. Makes you want to move there right now. There are several laugh-out-loud moments, and even a couple that brought a tear to my eye. However, I'm glad I pre-screened it before I brought my four-year-old. There are some scenes that are too intense for her to handle on the big screen. I will definitely purchase the DVD, but will not be bringing her to the theatre. Oh, and that cartoon before the movie was gut-busting. What fun!",2007
10,"Brad Bird's latest creation takes place in Paris, the city that is thought by many to be the city of the worlds greatest food. However, there are some problems. Mainly, that our hero, Remy (Patton Oswalt), is a rat. A rat that is a brilliant chef with a taste for fine food, but a rat none the less. Running from a mad old granny with a shotgun, being separated from his family, being flushed down one of the biggest pipes EVER! and being followed by the ghost of the late, great Gusteau, the chef that says ""Anyone can cook"", are just some of the problems the poor rat has to face.

8,"""Ratatouille"", to pick a culinary metaphor, is, like the curate's egg, excellent... in parts.

9,"Brad Bird is by far the best writer/director of animated films coming out of America in a long time. Besides a Hayao Miyazaki, there is no one else with the track record that this guy has. From The Iron Giant to the Incredibles to now Ratatouille, Bird just gets better and better with each new move. This new Pixar installment is definitely the most intellectually stimulating yet, but really which of his films haven't been intelligent first, kiddie-catering second? Ratatouille is by all means cinematic in scope and execution. There is nothing to this movie that screams animation besides the fact that it is a cartoon. The characters are all well fleshed out with emotions and inner struggle to survive the lives they want at the expense of that laid before them. Each frame is also composed with a sense of cinematography for real life. The expanses of Paris are breathtaking to behold and many camera movements stay within the constraints of a true machine there to capture the action. Bird's world on display is all encompassing and you will be fully immersed into the tale, no matter what age, because it never loses its integrity or ability to surprise with its never ceasing authenticity.",2007

1,"I have three major gripes about this film, all of which have numerous sub-gripes. The first and most obvious is the extremely terrible quality and extremely high quantity of Computer Generated effects. When I say the effects are bad, I refer to the zombie like ""infected,"" zombie dogs, the deer that roam the streets, the lions that escaped from the zoo, right down to the butterfly that Will Smith's dog looks at. These have to be the worst special effects of the 21st century. Not a single thing is convincing for one second. What's even more puzzling than the inexplicably poor effects is the sheer amount of them. Will Smith captures a zombie and brings it to his lab. Even the body on the table is computer generated. Could they REALLY not get a person to lay on table and do nothing for a few minutes? I'm not the type of person who goes to the movies to see special effects, but when they are so bad as to ruin any suspense or drama by taking you out of the movie, then they are an unquestionably bad part of the film.",2007

Guess product placement is more important than realism? * Neville has useless 'pastimes' with no explanation. Just juvenile fulfilment? Again, driving shiny fast cars through overgrown NYC.

That's definitely not a good thing. I think the problem was definitely the script, the story was not explained well as well as the character development needed improvement. The way that I Am Legend was shot very well, it had a very isolated and cold feeling. Will Smith does a fine job of acting; his best though? Not so much. The story also took a strange turn from Sci-Fi to religion towards the end. Not to mention, was this a zombie film? I don't know, because it was never explained.",2007

But I was pleasantly surprised to see Will Smith, ""Robert Neville,"" give a spectacular performance, full of emotion and anger, and bordering a bit on the insane side. I take off points only because it seems like a film that's been done before (and it has, I know, but I don't mean literally). What sets it apart from the rest of the post-apocalyptic man made human killing virus that zombifies people films is the depth of Will Smith's character. With cross-cuts to dreams and the portrayal of Robert Neville's loneliness, the audience connects with him on both a deep mental level and a more surface level driven by pathos. You both laugh and cry with him, you jump out of your seat when he gets scared, and you cheer for him throughout. I walked in expecting a zombie shoot-em-up and settled into something much more thought provoking and intense. It wasn't perfect, but it certainly deserves a look, even if you're not into the whole undead thing.",2007
6,"This film could easily have filled 2.5 hours of content. Why did it only last 1.5? I want more back story. I want more character development, especially toward the end. I want to know more about what happened, and how Will Smith's character is dealing with it. In short, I just want MORE.",2007
1,"I am legend is a very predictable story of what happens when an engineered cure for cancer turns malign. The resulting virus, which mostly resembles rabies, kills most of the population worldwide, except for some 500 million that turn into... of course, a sort of werewolves that feed on the remaining million that are immune. This in itself is a very worn out and unrealistic theme by now and the werewolf angle only makes it more silly.",2007

1,"Basically this film changes the main character COMPLETELY, deletes EVERY OTHER character from the novel, ends with Neville being a hero rather than an ANTIHERO, contains a dog in a completely changed way from the novel, and ADDS all other characters completely NOT in the book. Also, Neville's family is killed in a helicopter crash in the film. In the book, his wife returns from the dead as a vampire and Neville visits her in the mausoleum nearly every day. He longs to be with her. His daughter too dies from the plague of the disease.",2007
8,"If I could sum this movie up in one sentence, it would be this: Go Will. Will Smith is the driving force of I Am Legend. His performance as Dr. Robert Neville is impeccable. Living in a deserted NY city, his acting is reminiscent of Tom Hanks in Cast Away, but instead of a volleyball, he has mannequins and a faithful German Shepard named Sam. His basement, a retro-fitted, high-tech lab to find a cure for the disease that has turned the population of the entire planet into mutant, zombie-like, hive mind, blood-thirsty monsters, and, for some reason, Robert is immune. His days, spent hunting. His nights, sleeping with a high-powered rifle and hoping that the mutants don't find him. Keeping the movie flowing are well placed flashbacks that show what happened to Robert's family and why he is there. The movie falters a bit at the end, maybe at the last 5 minutes, but it doesn't ruin the plot or acting put forth. Containing wonderful cinematography and CG, I Am Legend is a spectacular film that I will be seeing again! PS - Shout out to my NY National Guardsmen in this film! Great job!",2007
8,"Is it me, or does every movie that portrays the future, it's always some post-apocalyptic setting or the fall of man with man itself to blame? Not a lot to look forward to is it? Anyways, after years of being let down by so called scary zombie/virus movie genres and other blockbuster thriller debacles, ""I Am Legend"" really separates itself from the group.",2007
1,"This was like Spike Lee directing a George Romero movie that could have been an hour shorter. All of the ""infected"" looked like Gollum from Lord of the Rings mixed with Beowulf. If the flashbacks were framed near the beginning, maybe I would have cared if he was alone. With the lack of soundtrack, it made the movie drag on like it was four hours long and do we need to place the camera on Will Smith for two minutes, watching him stare at nothing? He only has about two expressions in his repertoire anyway. This movie could have been great but it was edited all weird and could have used some music to heighten his alone time to pull us into his miserable world. If you want to see the concept done correctly, in my opinion, check out The Last Man on Earth with Vincent Price. Same thing done well. Or even Omega Man with Charlton Heston. They were actually more real and scarier, just another example of Hollywood putting style over substance to give The Fresh Prince an Oscar nod.",2007
5,Having seen some promising trailers I today decided to go and see I Am Legend. The film kicks off with a newscaster interviewing a scientist about what is thought to be a cure for cancer. The scientist's amateurish method of helping the layman understand how the cure actually works - using the simile of a car and its driver - made me wonder whether the film would persist with this kind of dumbing down.,2007
3,"First off, I'm glad to see I'm not the only one disappointed with this movie.",2007
8,"I just saw this movie today, the day it opened here. And was deeply, deeply moved.",2007
9,The way that they created the look of Manhattan in this movie was just wonderful and Will Smith pulls off one of his best acting turns as Robert Neville. The way he has his days planned out and still attempting the research to find a cure for the virus is a key part to the development of both character and plot.,2008
8,"American Gangster has been really hated upon in many of the former posts I have read. Yet it seems like they are all saying the same thing, that Gangster didn't have enough action and was really drawn out. Anyone who has every seen a Ridley Scott film will know that his films are long! Blade Runner, A Good Year, Matchstick Men, Hannibal, Black Hawk Down, Gladiator, G.I. Jane, Thelma and Louis, and Alien all ran for at least two hours or more, so big surprise there guys. In addition Scott didn't set out to film another scarface, he set out to tell a story not just about Frank Lucas but rather a tale of corruption and how pervasive it is. One user commented that this film had many side story lines that ""bloated"" the story. This is completely untrue as every ""side story"" is actually the overarching story about the fight against corruption in every facet of life, even Frank Lucas attempts several times to eradicate the corruption in his organization.",2007
5,I love Denzel and Russell. They have made great movies.,2007
9,"Ridley Scott's new flick American Gangster was a good one. Though Im not gonna be saying it's the best film of the year or anything like that. It was directed well, barely any dull scenes, great acting by an enormous cast and was really well-written. Unfortunately the story never seemed ""new"" to me. I was reminded of other drug-related/crime movies, like BLOW, CITY OF GOD, and evening TRAINING DAY.....""My Man"". Though it's in the leagues as being entertaining as the above mentioned movies, it really just never felt like I was watching a ""new"" story. But speaking of story, I never knew anything about Frank Lucas, and his story is fantastic. A black man who was more influential than his Mafian brethren? Tell me you're kidding. Nope, he was a force in Harlem back in the late 60s and early 70s and barely anyone knows about it. But for me this area of the film was the only stand out part. Sure there are other good scenes, done well, but nothing worth mentioning. Well, scratch that, naked women workin in a drug lab was an eye-opening scene.",2007
9,"Watch American Gangster without preconceived ideas. While the film is long it never drags. You don't get the sense that you've seen this movie before. It's not Serpico. It's not The Wire. It's not The Sopranos. While much is going on, the story is easy to follow. There is action, but this isn't an ""action movie"".",2007
6,"I was looking forward to this film, most of Denzel's films in the past few years have been exceptional. Unfortunately, this one isn't.",2007
6,"If you have seen Serpico, Scarface, and The French Connection, you don't need to see American Gangster. Ridley Scott's new biopic unfortunately shows how a group of stunningly talented craftsmen can create an uninspiring, lackluster, and by-the-numbers piece of cinema. Certainly there are good moments. There is a nice verbal face off between Crowe and Washington (ala HEAT) but its appeal lies more in the power of its stars than in the power of the story. Never is there a moment when I was unaware that I was watching Crowe and Denzel.",2007
8,"Now i've heard some mixed reactions to this movie, and I must say I don't think that. American Gangster is a perfect gangster film. A rise and fall film, but it is done better than both Empire and Carlito's Way put together. Where Empire fails, American Gangster prevails where historical accuracy is needed as well as a good background story. It's violent and sometimes shocking, but being an avid gangster/crime fan i know that compared to others this is almost nothing.",2007
5,"The latest Ridley Scott/Russell Crowe collaboration reminds me a lot of Serpico (1973.) You've got the star talent (i.e. Crowe in place of Pacino), the premise of an honest policeman working nearly alone to expose corruption in the police force and the backdrop of 1970s New York to do it in. Also, like Serpico, it fails to deliver in most respects. Much of the film concerns Denzel Washington as the eponymous American Gangster Frank Lucas, a violent criminal from Harlem with a monopoly on the heroin trade in New York. Russell Crowe is Richie Roberts, the narcotics officer tasked with bringing him down. Sounds exciting doesn't it? Well it isn't. At 157 minutes long, 'Gangster was always going to have a job keeping the audience's attention for the entire time. However, it didn't even keep my attention for half the time. The various threads at the start of the film take over an hour to actually intertwine with each other, by which time I didn't care anymore. Even then, there's no payoff until around near the end with a pseudo-Godfather montage of Richie destroying Lucas' entire operation while Lucas attends church with his mother. I for one expected Lucas to go down in a blaze of frenzied violence inside the church (indeed a Denzel-Training Day death was all I was waiting for,) thus salvaging some of the previously wasted 2 hours but no, it's not that kind of film. Instead, Frank Lucas provides evidence against all the corrupt narcotics policemen in New York and gets to serve a fifth of his prison time for it. So basically the story is 'Policeman arrests baddie who rats on other baddies and goes to prison but not for long.' How disappointing.",2007
10,"Starting off, this probably shouldn't be grouped in as a mob film. For one, Crowe's character is as much the lead as Denzel, this is a cops catching the criminal movie. But also, there's not much mob, it's Frank Lucas at the top and everyone else trying to attach to him, he's one man and that is made very clear.",2007
9,"American Gangster seems on the surface to be what has been dubbed by some critics as ""the black Scarface."" As Ridley Scott's new film details, this isn't really the case aside from the point of 'rose up from nothing became something through crime', which could be said about almost every gangster film including the Godfather. Here Scott and screenwriter Steve Zaillian, without calling attention to it ala Paul Haggis, have made a film about class issues underneath the typical gangster-movie form. Even more than the Departed, one sees as the film goes on an environment of paradox: Frank Lucas was a low-life, a killer, a ruthless thug, and at the same time found time to take his mother to church every Sunday and gave out turkeys to folks in the neighborhood while providing them enough dope to die off in the process.",2007
10,"Finally a good, accurate, gangster drug-trafficking film that makes you think. It's far from Polyanna and lets no-one group off; not gangsters of any race or ethnicity, not cops on the take, addicts, etc. And importantly, the story, based upon the true life story of Frank Lucas, does not profile a stereotypical black gangster gone wrong but instead shows an elegant, intellectual man who rises to the top of his game but then learns something new in the end. The film is a sure-shot into the Oscars but more importantly, for me, it's a film that is socially responsible and imparts a thoughtful message for any viewer,especially in light of current times.",2007
1,"Yeah, yeah I know its Ridley Scott and it will probably win a few academy awards and he made Alien and Gladiator and bla bla bla but when I watched this with a friend, we almost fell asleep from boredom. It's suppose to be a gangstermovie but all they do is talk, talk, talk. Almost no action at all. Russel Crowe displays wooden acting which he has done in all his movies except from ""Proof of life"" and ""LA Confidential"". Denzel Washington doesn't look anything like the real Frank Lucas. He is way too handsome. And he plays the character too much like a nice guy and here is why that is a problem.",2008
5,"If it were a made for TV movie it would be passable, but as a star studded feature film it falls flat on its' face.",2007
8,"American Gangster is one of the best movies i've recently seen and it is a pleasure to watch even if you are not a gangster movies fan. The story is more captivating than i expected i must say, following Frank Lucas(Denzel Washington) - the afro-American drug lord who raised above all, even the Italian mafia - and Richie Roberts(Russel Crowe), the honest cop in a city full of corruption, sort of Frank Serpico but with less guts. ",2007
7,Unfortunately from listening to everyone else I was expecting some sort of masterpiece. That is not what I believe what I got. Yet it was still a very good movie.,2008
9,The story about Frank Lucas is one that proves fact is more interesting than fiction. The fact that such a character really did exist yet I do not remember it certainly intrigues me. I guess I was just too young at the time it broke. Now approaching my later forties finds me longing to research it further after seeing this movie.,2007
1,"This movie is a total failure. Totally devoid of any cinematic merits.Waste of money and talent. Seriously, I struggle to find in it just a single redeeming feature.",2007
4,"For those who are looking for a equally compelling gangster movie like ""Goodfellas"" or ""Donnie Brasco"", well keep looking, because ""American Gangster"" simply doesn't fit the bill. It's like buying a new car, that looks great on the outside and everything looks like it's in tact. Then when you start, the motor, smoke comes pouring out, the tires become flat, and eventually, the engine dies out. That's how I felt about this movie. The critics hyped about how wonderful this movie is, only to end up with a bag full of nothing. ",2009
8,Where to start?,2007
3,"Plot line: 1) Small time thug makes it big within a crime family (which the movie doesn't explain, the audience is just supposed to accept this- wouldn't other top guys in the family have an issue with the driver being the new lead? I think so) 2) Gets involved with drugs 3) Makes a lot of money from drugs 4) Has a beauty queen wife (oh my god, she almost got caught in an attempted hit on her Mafioso husband! No way! What an interesting, ground-breaking twist!) 5) Gets caught by the most stereotypical cop in film today (bad father, womanizer, the cop with a conscience) Anyone seen this before? Go to Netflix and look at the ""Crime drama"" category, and there's an endless list of films that follow this same plot line, but are much much better.",2007
6,Well thank god Denzel pulls a solid performance out of the bag because without it this film would fall apart.,2007
8,"The best thing this movie had going for it - which is no surprise - is the acting duo of Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe. How many bad movies do you see with either of those guys starring in them? Not many, and neither actor disappoints here. Both play fascinating guys, Washington, a big gangster (""Frank Lucas"") and Crowe, an honest cop (""Richie Roberts"") ",2008
4,"This is basically a paint-by-numbers crime drama, and I didn't like it much at all. Not only is it just repeating themes and story lines that have been done ad nauseum in older, better films, but it brings absolutely nothing new to the table. The characters are all very conventional, unsurprising, and totally bland. Any attempt to add depth into these one-dimensional, shadowy figures comes across as very obvious and totally disingenuous. Crowe's character is occasionally interesting, but he soon reverts to the ""womanizing boy scout"" that is too natural, and, thus, not natural at all. Denzel is just playing Denzel, there's no hint of danger or hostility in his performance, even when he's performing criminal acts. You get the sense that he could stop selling drugs and coach a football team. The dialogue is all very obvious and to-the-point, the sets and costumes are loud and garish and, again, far too obvious, and the direction is uninspired and largely unremarkable. It's a solidly made, but thoroughly mediocre mob tale.",2008
8,"Any movie that runs for 157 minutes needs to be exceptionally gripping in order to keep its audience fully engaged from start to finish but that's just what ""American Gangster"" manages to do. Its story about the rise and fall of a Harlem drug lord is extraordinary because he's home grown (rather than the usual Mafioso) and achieves his success primarily by using his business acumen. The fact that he's a fascinating character provides a consistent level of interest throughout and the knowledge that the events depicted are based on a true story gives the whole undertaking even more substance.",2015

The comedic writing is non-existent, in fact I face serious repercussions by even comparing it to entertainment of any sort. Here is the premise.

Most of prime time network TV is way too adult themed to feel good about letting her watch, and many of the kid shows are just too annoying for my tastes. Along comes iCarly, a show my daughter and I have watched from the beginning. The show is definitely aimed at kids, but there are enough funny moments (often provided by Spencer, played by Jerry Trainor) to keep me interested as well. All of the four main characters (Carly, Sam, Freddy and Spencer) are likable and have good chemistry. You get the feeling that they like each other off the set as well. As the first season is coming to an end, I can only hope they'll continue making more. I recommend this for any Dad (who has a sense of humor and still knows how to be a kid once in a while) to watch with his kid(s).",2008

Miranda Cosgrove does a star performance as Carly Shay, the 13 year old girl who hosts the web show. The character is a pinnacle of a happy person. Her friends are just as interesting and well played, especially Sam, possibly the most interesting character on the show. The themes are usually happy and positive, and it sends good messages about life in general. If anyone needed something to take their minds off their problems or to relax or take a break, this is an excellent show that will make anyone laugh. It is definitely comedic, in a very well designed way. Characters are usually funny for what they do or who they are, not because of scripted lines or jokes. The whole mood of the episodes are nice and funny, and like any good piece of art, it is propelled by the characters. If anyone ever wants to calm down, relax, and watch a little light hearted TV, this is the show. I recommend it to anyone interested in relaxation.",2008
9,"Nik have a bonafide hit on their hands with this charming vehicle for the talents of star Miranda Cosgrove (formerly a supporting cast member and frequent scene-stealer on Drake & Josh). Created by former Head of the Class alumni, Dan Schneider, iCarly follows the adventures of a Seattle teen and her friends under the supervision of her unconventional older brother while her father is deployed abroad in military service. The cast is wonderful. Schneider has taken his knack for discovering young talent to new heights with this gifted ensemble whose singular and collective abilities frequently rise above the material -which is pretty good to begin with. As with previous discovery Amanda Bynes, Miranda Cosgrove exhibits tremendous skill and good comic timing coupled with honest-to-goodness likability. The same can be said of co-stars Nathan Kress, Jeanette McCurdy and Jerry Trainor who perfect a balance of silliness and earnestness without crossing into ridiculous or unbelievable territory. None of them oversell a bit or mug camera like in certain other Nik or Disney shows. With writing that is far from juvenile while still appealing to a young audience, iCarly is quite enjoyable and proves that youth programming doesn't have to pander to the lowest common denominator to attract an audience. Good, solid programming.",2008

Miranda Cosgrove, who acts as the main character Carly, looked almost worthy of her own show when she was on Drake and Josh. Unfortunately, iCarly was a big let down. Not only can Miranda not act convincingly enough, but she's incredibly stiff when she moves. She looks as if she's not sure how the character ""carly"" would move or stand. In the very first episode at the end when she throws the hat up, her arm doesn't ever leave her side from her elbow up. even when she was dancing she looked like a stick in the breeze. And the singing? The theme song was great, only because Drake had been in it, the music was pretty good and Miranda's voice sounded fake.

However, a friend of mine tried to convince me that ""Transformers"" might be worth an attempt, based on the fact that a non-history related, action-packed comic-and-toy-franchise-adaption might be a fitting theme for a megalomaniac director like Bay. Even the critics who booed ""Pearl Harbor"" back then said that Bay had finally found his genre, and that ""Transformers"" was indeed an enjoyable popcorn movie. So my buddy and me went to the cinema.... and I painfully realized I should have stuck to my promise!!! I'm still looking for negative superlatives to describe the movie, because ""awful"", ""horrible"", ""worst movie ever"" and ""complete waste of time and brain cells"" just don't quite say it.",2007
2,THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS.,2007
6,"I went to see an advance screening of ""Transformers"" tonight, and I walked out of the theater in disbelief. Not because the movie wasn't what I thought it would be, but on the contrary, it was so much more than I had ever expected.",2007
1,"This deafeningly loud, obnoxious, usually stagnant and glorified epic disaster of a film was presented with too many opportunities to be one of the all-time greatest summer flicks ever. However, despite the advancements in today's special effects, it being inspired from the highly popular 1980's Hasbro toys and cartoon, with Steven Spielberg overseeing the production as an Executive producer, Michael Bay and his writers were still guilty of making this a ""steaming pile."" I can effortlessly breakdown at every level why this film didn't work for me.",2007
2,"There is not enough syntax in my own very limited vocabulary that could express just how horrible this film was. Let me be fair by starting off with the fact that I freakin love Transformers. I watched transformers non stop, and then continued on with the series with the whole beast wars bit. The autobots are awesome. Now keeping that in mind, only anyone dumber than a monkey will like this film. There is no glue to hold the film together. Stuff happens without any explanation at all. There are no rules. The only rule is that anything could happen at any point without any explanation for any reason, and you just go along.",2007
1,"I loved the cartoon series as a kid and, after seeing the commercials, thought it would be freaking awesome. Instead, I wound up stuck in a movie with a ridiculous plot, too many irrelevant characters, and too much sex humor for a movie that is supposed to be about giant robots wailing on each other (I am in my twenties and male, so I can hardly be considered a prude. The fact that even I cringed at the mother making masturbation jokes means that there is such a thing as a limit for that sort of humor). Most of the Transformers do not even show up until the movie is halfway over. The subplot of the signal detection team (who did nothing except point out that some alien being had hacked the network-a no-brainer) could be cut without losing anything of note (except for the funny scene where Anthony Anderson's on-screen cousin gets tackled by the FBI agent into the pool). And what's with Bumblebee pissing on the FBI Agent, and Mikaela making him take his clothes off? The action scenes are stellar, but not enough to make up for all of the other mistakes in the movie. If you copy and pasted scenes from Independence Day, Matrix Revolutions, a bunch of US air force commercials and Bad Santa all together on your computer, you would wind up with basically the same mess.",2007
1,"Seriously, why do we still see Michael Bay movies? We, as a people, need to unite against him. And how in God's name is this movie in the top 250 right now? This movie is lucky that I just saw Spiderman 3, otherwise this would be the worst movie of all time. ",2007
1,"What a concept it was. Two rival factions of transforming robots crash land on Earth, and are re-awoken in 1984 to continue their epic struggle amongst a vastly inferior race. One side, the heroic Autobots, battles to save their homeworld from the evil Decepticons.",2007
3,"I grew up watching the Transformers in the early-mid '80s. When I first heard that a live-action adaptation was in the works, I was interested. When I heard Stephen Spielberg was involved, I was excited. When I found out Michael Bay was involved, I was just depressed.",2007
3,"Summer action flicks should never be seen with the preconceived notion of high expectations. The reason for this is simple: eye candy films that are released when school is out aim for a youthful demographic who are simply looking for good way to kill 2 and half hours. These films can be instant blockbusters even without a coherent plot or compelling dialogue. Films about massive robots based on a toy line which wreak havoc narrow the demographic further (and lower the bar of cinematic standards), but throw in wannabe epic director Michael Bay (Armageddon, Pearl Harbor) and you can guarantee the trailer will pull in other audiences. I never played with the toys or watched the cartoon, but it can be assured nothing more meets the eye than CGI goo and decent Foley artists on sound in Transformers.",2007
1,"I saw the advance screening a few days ago and in a nutshell, two whole years of anticipation were stripped away by a flash of severe disappointment within the first 45 mins of this film. I'm a hard-core G1 fan and can't tell you how blasphemous this film is to those of us who who followed the original series from Cybertronian history to character profiles and traits.",2007
8,"What a fantastic film! That's the first thing I thought when the credits rolled up. I saw this only on TV a while back on one of the digital channels. This was much better than the terrible sequel because the film was a new idea with a fresh plot, the special effects were excellent and I loved the car transforming into the robots and back again. Shia LaBeouf's performance was great with decent support from Jon Voight and Megan Fox who played the loved interest. It was also very funny and not childish like the second and the camera-work wasn't all over the place. I will always like this first film, which Michael Bay has done well with but not the second. Yes this film is long but it holds your interest because it's new but the second was just repetitive.",2011
3,"I have been a fan of the transformers since my childhood, ever since I first saw the robots in action I was awe struck. When i heard that they were going to do live action movie I thought 'Wow, its got to be impossible to get that wrong!' You could be forgiven for thinking that a movie about waring giant robots that transform into various vehicles would be about robots. So I would have to ask where were they?? What were they doing?? In this movie they get very little screen time and even less character development than a dog, which is called 'Mojo' in case you were wondering.",2007
1,"I went into this movie expecting mindless action and cool looking robots, and was very disappointed. Forget that it had almost no story, and the story it did have was lame. Forget that it was basically a two-hour commercial for the army. The bottom line is that this was the worst looking 150 million dollar movie I have ever seen. It looked like a bunch of actors in front of a blue screen pretending to interact with extremely cartoonish-looking robots.",2007
1,"Tripe. Filth. Mud. Worthless. Blunt. Stupid. These are six words that aptly describe the idea behind Michael Bay's latest smash-fest ""TRANSFORMERS."" ",2007
8,"I was able to catch a screening of 'Superbad' last night in NYC and I was very pleased with the movie. I'm sure most will compare this to an 'American Pie' like comedy, but it's so much more than that. There were some ""shock value"" moments, but very well done to tip the scale more to funny than to gross.",2007
9,"I got to see an advanced screening the other night, complete with an interview with the cast. I figured this movie could go either way, especially when you consider ""40 year-old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up"" were funny and entertaining, but they weren't exactly loved by all.",2007
10,"This movie is one of the funniest of the 21st century. The jokes are hilarious, and it is spoken by a great cast. Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Seth Rogen, and others are excellent in their roles. The characters they play you really latch on to you. They are extremely likable in many ways. The dialogue is also superb. It's a fast moving script that gives many great lines by the end of the movie. Also at the end I sorta felt some happiness. It's one thing to make me laugh throughout, but to make a vulgar comedy like this actually make my heart warm is a very big plus. It's a film about friendship, and that message manages to find its way through all the vulgar stuff.",2010
10,"I have been lucky enough to see two advanced screenings of Superbad in Burbank. It is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time. When I read the summary, I was a bit skeptical. The ""high school comedy"" is not exactly my cup of tea. My love for Michael Cera's performance in Arrested Development drove me to the theater and man was I glad I went. This is not your typical high school comedy. The writing is much smarter and funnier and the acting is superb. This movie so far transcends American Pie and its ilk that it cannot really even be compared. Go see this movie!!! I have a feeling it is going to go off the charts once the buzz gets around about how hilarious it is.",2007
10,"Well, I just got back from the Superbad screening tonight (thanks to the folks at MySpace) and I must say that this is a very special teen movie. It has that same element of transporting you back to your high school days that the original American Pie had. Michael Cera does great as the awkward teenage kid, basically a reprise of his role as George Michael on Arrested Development. But it is Jonah Hill who absolutely rules this movie! He had me laughing from the beginning to the end. His ""silly fat-kid"" character is the only one in the history of movies that shows what it truly feels like to be the funny fat kid in high school. I should know, I was one! Gosh, I just can't believe how well he portrayed the unmitigated hell that was P.E.! Emma Stone and Martha Maclsaac also give very realistic depictions of teenage girls. None of that fake, over the top nonsense. The most over-the-top character was ""McLovin"" himself, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, who did a great job of having us laugh with him as much as we did at him.",2007
8,"Superbad is a teen movie. It also will draw comparisons to American Pie, in it's ""losers try to get laid"" themes, and occasional gross-out comedy. But the comparison is unfair - Superbad is a funnier, more subversive and more importantly genuine movie than American Pie or any of it's awful sequels were. The three central characters have a believable, likable relationship, that the film takes time to establish. Cera, Hill (who deserves special praise, for turning what could have been a really unlikeable character into a sweet, if loud-mouthed and crass, teenager) and Mintz-Plasse bounce of each other perfectly. The movie creates some funny situations, and more importantly, hilarious dialogue throughout. Aside from one comedic misfire - an overly long (and poorly judged) gross out sight gag involving a pair of trousers and a dance - Superbad had me laughing constantly. It's sweet, it's funny as hell, and it's established a load of new talent.",2007
7,"Okay, so today i went to an advanced screening of this movie. It was really last minute and I didn't know much about it other than it was from the makers of The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up and it looked pretty funny.",2007
8,"I enjoyed ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin,"" but didn't feel it was entirely worthy of all the enormous acclaim it garnered. And for all the praise ""Knocked Up"" received, I thought it was fairly average. So I wasn't expecting much from ""Superbad."" However, I'd have to say it's the smartest and funniest Apatow film yet. I know he didn't direct it, but his influence is distinct. And in the past I've felt indifferent towards Apatow's brand of humour, but combined with Rogen's sensitivity towards the teen condition here, it works really well.",2008
8,"Superbad may look like a typical high-school movie on the cover, but its actually much more. It follows a trio of high-school seniors that decide to have one last party before leaving for college (and one last shot at grabbing a girl). The trio consists of Seth, Evan, and Fogell. They make a likable main cast that is very easy to compare to. Their acting style is ideal for this type of film. Joining them are several other intriguing characters. My favorite were the two police officers, Slater and Michaels. Pretty much every scene with them made me laugh; from their references to other movies to the spoofs on being an officer, its classic slapstick comedy.",2007
9,"Superbad was an absolutely hilarious film. There were so many mind bogglingly hilarious one-liners in the film that I will need to watch it again to see which ones I missed while I was laughing. This is one movie that I will definitely watch every time they rerun it on cable in the future. It had its completely gross-out teen moments, but those were grounded by its hilariously absurd and witty (also gross) conversations. Michael Cera was great, and most Arrested Development fans should find his performance here just as entertaining as his take on the George Michael character he played on that show. He is absolutely awkward and downright hilarious. Jonah Hill is the funniest he has ever been, confidently spouting out uproariously funny lines at every hot girl in sight.",2007
1,"I would give this film a negative rating if I could. Although saying that, I'm not sure if I can give it a fair rating because I walked out of the cinema. ",2008
1,"I don't understand how this movie can have a rating of 7.9. Maybe the people voting on this one first reduced their IQ's by about a 100 points. I think that the name of this movie says it all. When you go to see it (which I suggest you don't) you can expect to have a SUPERBAD time. The maker of this movie seems to have no train of thought. The storyline is completely mind numbingly dumb. The two main characters are completely gay for each other. You can hear the word ""fuck"" at least 2 million times in the movie making your ears sick of hearing it by the end of it. Add to all this it is two hours long at the end of which you might feel like killing yourself. Take my word for it skip this movie, its as bad as it could get.",2008
1,"Giving it 1 and even that's generous. Grossly overrated movie i've ever came across, really makes me question people's morality and intelligence at the same point. Looking at it as a female made me scared. Seeing that nothing has changed, women are still inferior and only serve for some sexual object and that is it. Ugly guy gets a model looking girl...but could an ugly girl get a model looking guy? It's pure brainwashing, seeding false morality and abominated view upon women. I really am scared it got such high rating...what kind of a person thinks this is even remotely funny? I'm not a Christian i'm not 60 years old either. I'm 24 and a female and i do have values that seem to be lost or rare to find in this days society. Sadly. If you have similar point of view as i do don't even bother with this garbage of a movie. Waste of your money, time and brain cells. It felt like my IQ has lowered after watching it.",2009
1,"Thought this was going to be funny. Turned it off half-way through and replaced it with Fast Times to try to relieve the depression ""Superbad"" thrust upon us.",2008
1,"I've heard tag lines that this movie will be ""this generation's Porky's."" Not even close. Tries way, way too hard and as a result is just plain stupid. Every other word is the F-word? Um, yeah, that gets old real fast. The plot is as old as they come: Male high school student buddies have two weeks 'til graduation, want to have sex before said school is out, must get alcohol along the way or this quest is apparently meaningless, experience unrealistic obstacles along the way, blah, blah, blah (yawn). Nothing unique here whatsoever. Just when there's an opportunity for a clever, funny line they decide ""Hey, let's pepper that line with more F-words."" Well, at least it lives up to its name, it is Superbad.",2007
1,"I have to hand it to Apatow. If you hype any movie enough, you sell tickets. While the 40 year old virgin was good, and knocked up was an average comedy, this movie was sub-sub standard. Maybe, that's why they call it Superbad, because it really is. My wife and I could not wait for this movie to end. It dragged and dragged on.",2007
2,"This is not the sort of film that I would normally watch. I saw a preview for it, and thought that very thing and discounted it. However, several factors made me rethink this decision, including two 4 star ratings in Empire Magazine and the local paper, and hearing that it was done by the same guy that was in Knocked up (which I thoroughly enjoyed).",2007
1,"Something that hasn't been picked up as frequently as I suspected it might have been is the 'trivia' section fact that the idea for this, er, 'movie' was dreamt up by two 13-year-olds.",2007
1,"I tried to enjoy this movie. I gave more effort into trying than I've ever attempted. It was a sorry excuse for a movie. I'm sure this movie adds more to the stereotype of how truly messed up American culture is...teenagers consumed with sex, beer, and drugs, who have an EXTREMELY limited vocabulary. The only reason I didn't walk out was because I was visiting my brother in another state. It's kind of hard to walk out of a movie theater and go home when you don't know where the hell you are. This movie took two hours of my life I will never get back...they could have been spent watching a movie that was actually original and not coated with the F word more than Louisiana was coated with water two years ago. I sat through Napoleon Dynamite...which, in my opinion, was terrible. But at least that movie was slightly original.",2007
5,"I had high hopes for this movie. The previews made it me think this was going to be a very funny movie if not he funniest movie of the summer and/or year. The media and audiences also adored this movie calling it hilarious but also heartwarming. I remember reading in the LA Times some quote suggesting this would be to American Pie what teenage John Hughes films were to ""Porky's"" and I enjoyed most of those movies mentioned in that analogy.",2007
4,"After I looked ""Superbad"" two questions came into my mind. First: Why should Seth Rogen write a screenplay after he acted so well in ""Knocked Up""? and 2nd: Why was this movie rated to Top 250 in IMDb? ""Superbad"" hasn't a story (underaged people only cruise around to get alcohol for a party) and the gags aren't funny. All the plot is about male virgins who want to have sex and talk about it, about alcohol and strange cops who are kids in mind. That's all. Yes, sometimes some jokes about vomiting or drunk people are funny, but they can't be the only content of a movie. Yes, the story and the stereotype characters are entertaining on a low level, but there should be more than the average plot of ""American Pie"" to fill 90 minutes and more. Critical oder serious elements I hadn't found during looking the movie and so I wished, that this teen-trash is over soon. Maybe other people would be found, that this movie is very funny and brilliant. But ""Superbad"" only repeats elements of earlier puberty comedies without vary the gags oder the story. Only weak this movie.",2007
1,"This film sucks! To me, it is just the film ""American Pie"" dressed up, re-shaped and tells the story of hormone-driven teens who decide to drink and try to get laid. Not much story anymore. Every teen movie now-a-day's take the story from ""American Pie"" and try to cover it up and pass it off as an ""original"" story? It's not. Lame over-acting to attempt to make the teenagers of this generation ""laugh""/lame script/lame story that HAS BEEN USED NUMEROUS TIMES IN TEEN-FILMS. I don't know how people can class this as ""comedy."" It was funny first time round when ""American Pie"" was released but now that there is soo many movies released that show hormone-driven teens, under the influence of alcohol who want to have sex, my love for the original ""American Pie"" (which was at one time one of my favourite films) has worn off! Superbad (2007) is SUPER-BAD!!",2009
3,"I'm deleting my original review because, even though I still think some of the things in this movie are looney, over time, and having watched it on DVD numerous times since my first viewing, it has now become one of my favorite raunchy comedies. Despite that the character of Evan is a wishy-washy little twerp, and Seth is a selfish dipshit, I've now decided that they're both hilarious. And McLovin is classic. The cops are still a WTF!?!? but hey, the things some cops do in real life are even more bizarre.",2007
1,"I don't think I watched enough of 'Superbad' to be able to review it fairly, if I'm being honest. I lasted until just after the section that recounted Seth's childhood obsession with drawing dicks, and realised ""hey, it's sunny outside, I'm in swingin' London.. I have literally got better things to do than sit here and watch this"". Congratulations to 'Superbad' on being the first film that I have ever walked out of.",2007
1,"There needs to be a rating choice of zero for shows like this. I have just watched the episode where they drag a homeless man off the street to ""play with"" and I have never felt so sad for these horrible people. The show is 100% pure car crash TV. The worst thing is that it is totally not ""reality"" and comes across as completely scripted, planned and faked.",2009
1,"This show can be so formulaic and stereotypical that it must be scripted--or improvised based on an outline the way ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" is. But while ""Curb"" ends up being painfully funny, ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians"" just ends up being painful.",2008
1,"Sadly, IMDb doesn't have a rating system under 1 to grade reality shows - and this reality program is a perfect example where zero should be installed.",2007
1,"As with all reality TV shows, ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians"" is a waste of airtime. Every episode involves stupid, idiotic people engaging in the same petty dramatics that have obviously been written and staged - rather poorly might I add. There is absolutely nothing special about this garbage, and I cannot see why anyone would find it the least bit enjoyable. The acting is poor, which is not surprising considering how untalented these individuals are. Kim is exactly like Paris Hilton, that alone being an excellent reason to change the channel. ",2010
1,"what's up with this crap? i was watching a whole episode. that's right a WHOLE episode. it dawned on me. have TV producers and executives lost wits and ideas. they let any rich bratty family on TV and their fame lies on Kim's ass (which is not bad), their extravagance, and the fact that patriarch Robert kardashian bailed out o.j Simpson and i even found out, on wikipedia no less, that o.j is Kim's godfather. i guess crime does pay. but going back to the subject. this particular episode features the elder kardashian sister throwing a fit cause mommy doesn't show up for a shoot and on top calls mommy a bitch. now, in my days (and bear in mind, im in my 20's, about the same age as some of the kardashian brats) disrespecting your parents like that, even if your parents were wrong, you got a slap in the face. but what does mommy kardashian do? she sends bratty a feel-better bouquet. now WHAT THE HELL IS THAT? if that's not an indication of screwed-up parenting, then i don't know what it is. next episode had the other kardashian sister posing for Peta. it just shows that these girls have no talent whatsoever other than what puberty gave them and they got cash to fix that. otherwise, you all know who the government will be bailing out next. this show sucks, if you want reality, you'll be better watching Kim's porno flick, which i hear is way better than Paris Hilton's. way to go E! entertainment. you just sunk yourselves deeper into your own creative manure.",2009
1,"First a 1/10 is as low as i was allowed to go..watched one episode of this garbage and after 10 minutes i felt violated by the absolute stupidity and pathetic nature of this show. Every one involved should be ashamed and be held in contempt for foisting this garbage upon the human race. The kardashians are famous right now because the one sister is basically in the words of the author and former NFL player a ""Jersey Jumper"" who's skill she foisted upon the world is the same thing that everyone can do but they do not put on tape. Yes let us make a show around someone like that and sugar coat it a trollop is a trollop the other sisters who's names are who cares and who really cares behave worse than my nephew and niece on a really bad day everyday by the way my nephew and niece are 8 and 12 and who cares about them. This show is a ripoff of the Osbourne's which i liked because Ozzie is a legend and likable along with the rest of his brood and a severely water down version of Gene Simmons Family Jewels another of the better reality shows and why people prefer those shows is that at least there are people with charisma in those shows while in this show just a bunch of self indulgent overaged teenagers with issues with promiscuity and a warped sense of self importance. I also have to say Bruce Jenner from Olympic golden boy to this what a drop and too boot he is whipped too.",2010
1,"This show is more political than just entertainment. We need to question why are so many people watching this show which has no important message. This shows makes us think of a society that is obsessed with watching reality even though it has no educational or informative message. it is a culture that is obsessed with a narcissistic society as Pecora write about in the Surveillance Society. The Kardashians not only make it seem that it is important to publish their private lives and make it an entertainment but they also send a message that many must critically analyze: consumerism. They show their houses and talk about their brands in order to target young audiences and not only receive money from the show but also from their brands. It is the complete exploitation of the fan audiences. When done watching an episode, audiences walk out with a desire to purchase things and speculate about useless stuff like how kim lost a $70,000 earrings in the pool and cried about it. The Kardashians want to create realism and influence an ideology of consumerism. Even though it is blatant their show is scripted or might be manipulated at times in order to create social media buzz. For example, when Kim Kardashian recorded the conversation with taylor swift and Kanye West and published it on snapchat in order to humiliate Taylor and gain more snapchat followers. It is all done for profit and fame. The real question that show make emerge critical discussions is why do the Kardashians believe people would want to watch their private lives? Isn't that exploiting the audience by using their time for useless content? As well as to promote their brands? Every episode is pointless and had drama that we don't need to see such as the drama when Bruce Jenner told the family he wants to transition to a female. The whole episode was Kylie, Kourtney, Khloe complaining about how he has never talked to them about this even though he's been feeling like a woman for a long time. How does this narrative and plot affect the audience? It doesn't teach us anything other than being obsessed with reality TV.",2016
1,"If you have to check the comment section to decide whether or not to watch the show then that decision has already been made for you (It's no if you didn't figure it out) and if you're already watching the show and reading this, stop wasting your precious life and be productive, like writing reviews to prevent other people from watching poorly scripted ""reality TV""",2016
1,I don't have much to say except that this trash should have been axed years ago. Not only it's polluting and turning innocent minds into junk but it's also turning them into self obsessive narcissistic selfie taking zombies. All this is due to some idiot trying to make this family happen. Someone sue the channel E! and ryan for this depravity / filth he created.,2016
1,"I had watched this series back in 2010 during my teens and I thought since all girls my age loved them, I might as well watch this too! As I was watching this, I absolutely felt depressed after watching at least a good few episodes of this because they always kept on yelling at each other and they really are just a fake bunch at the end of the day. They really love being on the camera 24/7 just so they get more money and become famous for being famous. It's such a sad life to being that selfish and spend it a lot on botox. They really have let themselves down by being such snobs and never really cared about other people. What is even more meaner is that they always complain over little things, even the mother is a bad role model to her children!",2015
1,"I watched an episode of KUWTK for the first time around 20 minutes ago. It was the most dull thing I have ever watched, and this includes Twilight. The episode was all about Kim turning into Kourtney (i.e., a boring mom) and her ""friend"", Jonathan, wanted to irritate her by hanging out with a Kim K lookalike. Meanwhile, Scott believes that there is a Kardashian curse upon all males associated with the family. He goes to a psychic to find out. This was the stupidest thing I've ever watched. This show is all about irresponsible adults going through teenage drama (and I can say this, being a teenager under the age of 15), concerning themselves with affairs related to clothes, ex-boyfriend/ex- husbands, and Calcutta gold marble. Frankly, listening to Morgan Freeman reading a book about grass would be more interesting than watching this was. I was extremely disappointed. All my friends have been raving about it. What a shame. Well, back to MasterChef... At least you learn something there.",2016
1,"This excuse for a TV show is not just terrible but I will say throughout all my years of watching TV I have never seen such a stuck up and annoying family I mean my god who really give a s#~/ about there lives you wanna be rich make a s# tape that's how they did it. The whole family pi#< me off I just sit there with my girlfriend asking myself why am I watching this and not a movie that's actually worth my time and effort.

1,"I've seen less than 3 minutes of Keeping Up with the Kardashians and this pathetic excuse of a television show highlights what is wrong with television today. Everyone, and I mean everyone on the show, just annoys the hell out of me to no end.

1,"Everything about this show is awful. It's ""reality TV"" but we all know that it is scripted. Even worse, this fake crap only serves to boost the careers of a family that is famous for two things: 1) amateur porn and 2) the OJ Simpson trial, and more so number 1 than number 2. It's sad that people eat this stuff up like a pig in front of a trough. I think it says something about a person who regularly ingests the lies this family tells as their form of entertainment.",2016
1,"I really hate this show. It just revolves around a super rich family and their daily lives. How on earth are they celebrities? They don't work hard to earn their money, they just get on with their lives and when an episode is over, they earn money like it's on a silver platter. What has this world come to you ask? Well stupid people just make other stupid people famous for no particular reason whatsoever! ",2015
1,"Terrible, who would watch this junk?! I mean really, she got famous from a sex tape.. she's trash, her entire family is trash and I'm tired of hearing about her in media. Nobody cares!

The most common reason is because it's a means for people to get away from their real lives for a short time, but that's a terrible reason, because by doing that, you're not helping anyone except the Kardashians, who clearly don't need anyone charity. Stop watching the show. If you want to drown out real life by watching TV, that's fine, I do that a lot, but it should be something that is not of the real world, otherwise you're just making your life look worse by comparison. Watch something like Breaking Bad or Friends or even Spongebob, but don't watch reality TV. It's pointless enough as it is.",2012

10,"Out of all of the shows on television, I would have to say that without a doubt, Chuck is the best show. It has the Perfect blend of drama and comedy. It is one of those shows that only gets better with time and I am hoping, no no, I am praying that Chuck gets a third season. Each one of the actors/characters brings something special to the show that makes it a huge success. Zachary Levi is a hilarious actor and he and Yvonne Strahovski have amazing chemistry. Adam Baldwin is always there to keep the show in line and his quirky one lines are perfectly timed. I hope they are given the chance to prove to the world that they are worth it!",2009
10,"Okay, for starters. Chuck has always been one of those shows that no matter where you pop in to it, it will be an exciting television show. Chuck offers a lot of fun, it offers you comedy, drama, and there are a lot of touching moments throughout the show. I, as a male, can honestly say that the Finale has made me cry like a baby. I have loved this show since the beginning of its airing, and there is nothing I want more than this show to continue. Unfortunately, I don't think it's going to be continued; but they may make a movie about it. If none of you have watched Chuck, or gave up on it, I suggest you continue, (or start), watching the show. It's a touching show, it's by far number one in the top ten most amazing shows, it HAS to be. When you watch the Series finale, you'll be tearing up.",2012

All summer we were ""duped"" into believing this was going to be Mr. Magoo meets Jane Bond. A regular Joe with a doofus complex meets Mrs. America gone international spy. He is unaware of her ""secret identity"" and she's aware that he unknowingly knows something he shouldn't, and that she might have to kill him at any second. This is not the plot at all, and would have been network gold if it was, in my opinion.",2007
10,"Chuck is unique. It is real. With the corny acting, the monotonous or bizarre plots, and the horrible story lines have claimed the life of too many of today's television shows, Chuck offers a refreshing plot, real emotion, and real problems. The ingenious plot uniquely blends action and drama with comedy and romance. The importance of the intersect on Chuck's life and how it changes him makes us look at our own lives and makes us wonder what it is that we want to get out of our lives. Adding to that the incredibly passionate and emotional love story of Chuck and Sara and discovering the importance of family (the Bartowski's) and friends (Morgan, Casey, Buy More Gang), watching Chuck makes you realize what really matters in life and makes you feel like part of a family, Chuck's family. ",2012
9,"I stumbled upon this gem 4 years back and binge watched the first three seasons in less than 2 weeks. This show is so very creative and never truly got the chance to be successful. It was just removed from Netflix unfortunately but is still one of my favorites. The show has 5 seasons and I would say the first 3 seasons contain some of the best episodes. The idea and execution of the entire show is so well done. The main character Chuck is funny and undeniably lovable just like his best friend Morgan. Chuck's romantic history may have him a little jaded when the beautiful and mysterious Sarah enters his life. If you're willing to give love a shot and want to have lots of laughs at this light-hearted action show Chuck is for you. I rated it a 9/10 because the final season does get a bit monotonous but the music, acting and plot are well worth the watch.",2017

10,"Chuck is an amazing show from start to finish, from the amazing pilot to the emotion pumped finale, it's a thrilling marriage between comedy and action. Chuck never fails to entertain, especially if you're a nerd and can relate to the main character, and the acting is spot on every single episode. It was an attempt at creating a comedy about spies at the beginning, but turned into an amazing plot driven show that just kept on giving to it's fans, the ones who kept it alive. The center of the show - the relationship between Chuck and Sarah is so great because of the chemistry between them. The finale of the show made me sad it was ending, because not only was Chuck a great comedy and action show in one, but a ray of light in the darkness that is the NBC schedule. Chuck will be forever be remembered by me as one of the best shows to ever exist.",2012

Till then farewell.",2017
10,"Chuck was the best show I ever saw, Chuck Bartowski is my favorite character because he is smart and good hearted. With or without the Intersect, Chuck is the best spy and a hero. Seasons 4 and 5 are my favorite seasons of all. I like how he is always brave is willing to protect his friends and family from being in danger, that makes him a great hero and a great leader. Chuck vs Undercover Lover and Chuck vs The Pink Slip were the only two episodes I disliked the most. For Pink Slip, I feel bad for Chuck because he was having a bad day because he was fired from the CIA and lost his chance to be with Sarah, it was never right for Casey to suggest Sarah to put him out of his misery due to his bad day being worse, but it was great that Chuck got two of his job back at the CIA and the Buy More, also Team Bartowski being reinstated. Chuck deserves to have a happy life and has friends and family who care for him, especially Sarah and Casey. For Undercover Lover, Casey pushed Chuck when he was comforting him when someone he loves is going back to undercover, good thing was that Casey accepted Chuck's help. There are two characters I also disliked which are Emmett Milbarge and Clyde Decker they are both one hundred percent jerks, I'm glad that they are gone for what they did to Chuck, for Emmett he was humiliating Chuck, although he met his end by being killed by an assassin who was trying to find Chuck, luckily no one cares that he is gone nor misses him and for Clyde Decker he would have let Sarah die and took the Intersect from Chuck, however he was killed by an ally of Chuck's to prevent him from framing him and his team. Two villains like to ruin people's lives and now they are gone. I always believed that Chuck and Sarah were meant to be together they have been friends for three seasons and an undercover relationship. True the relationship was strained due Chuck being a spy, but later is was restored in Season 3 and later they finally got together for real. Chuck and Morgan are the greatest friends of all and they are more like a dynamic duo. Casey is tough and strong, but he does care for Chuck and everyone. The two-hour series finale was the best episode to end Chuck and the final song for the show really fits in to conclude the series.",2016

10,"This is a great TV Show. Why, you ask? Well, it has the four most appealing genre's across the world. Comedy appeals to everyone. The comedy is usually at the Buy More store, with Morgan, Big Mike, Jeff, and Lester, but it's still a great way of splitting the four genres. Action. Action appeals mainly to men, and it is what makes Chuck great. Also, the ways that Chuck gets out of situations shows us that the creators were fans of MacGyver. Indeed, it references MacGyver in one episode, where Chuck says ""Those seven years of MacGyver finally paid off!"" Drama. Most people like drama, although toward the end of series two it became very dramatic, and they stopped putting too much humour in there. Finally, Romance. Romance is what makes a TV show good in a woman's point of view. Chuck has a little romance, and small parts of it, but only after Sarah realises her love for Chuck.",2010
10,"I expect some resistance to this, but i really think that Chuck is a special show. You do have to look at Chuck's slapstick( Dick Van Dyke, Three's Company), the supporting characters: lovable losers (Cheers, Drew Carrey Show), the setting( a Buy More. everyone can relate, we've been there), the love interest ( Lois & Clark, X-files). This show has taken all of these elements and put them to work. I think it works great! I began watching this about 5 episodes into season 1. I was hooked!! I bought season 1 on DVD and did not miss an episode of season 2. I was on the bandwagon to save chuck, but was also amazed to see the amount of noise made the fans. I was also amazed to see NBC not give it the push to start this fall, based on the fans feedback. It would be nice if this show was given the chance of a Jay Leno show, or a reality series.

The skeleton of ""No Country for Old Men"" is a cheap, 78-minute, gun-monster-chase B movie. Javier Bardem plays Anton Chigurh, the monster. He is Frankenstein; he is Max Cady from ""Cape Fear;"" he is from your childhood nightmares. He may be death personified.",2007
1,"When the trailers for Old Country came along, I must say I was mesmerized. The introduction of a wanton killer that seemingly strode his own path in a place and time yet to be determined. Along for the ride, the critics' glowing praise of the movie and especially the glow from Oscar winning performance of Javier Bardem sold me. I had missed the movie in the theatre, but seeing it on the big screen at home would make up for it. The anticipation began high, as the storyline was laid out. Heck, Josh Brolin was doing an excellent job with his little mentioned role. Tommy Lee Jones was giving another workmanlike laid-back performance as well. An there was, of course, Javier, plodding along. Okay, stick with this, it will grow and develop. Hour number two starts, and the foundation is well laid. Javier is playing a less than remorseful toad. Everyone else is playing their roles in a deadpan manner. Lord, is this what the people in Texas are really like? Don't worry, though. The critics have assured that Javier's performance is well worth it. Then the second hour ends. And so does the movie. Wait, is that the credits? You're kidding. Right? I just watch two hours of everyone playing like they were under Karloff's make-up from Frankenstein? Folks, Boris made that character believable and sympathetic. This drivel made me hate everyone associated with the movie. We didn't get a decent bad guy. We didn't get a story with a morality play. We didn't get decent ending or hope for the future. We got a stinking pile of manure and Oscar noted efforts. Well if this is what the Academy Awards have come to, then I'll make sure I never see another Award winning movie again. They passed on Kevin Costner as Mr. Brooks for this? Of, for God's sake, Please, someone tell me where I go to get a refund for the two hours of my life spent on this.

Other movies aren't so considerate. Others may be messy, but the good ones leave you asking key questions about the philosophy of the story. They may make you wonder ""What would I do in that situation?"" ""Was the hero really a hero?"" ""Do I agree with the film's moral?"" etc. These films draw you into the story, to the point where the ending is really the beginning of the film's lasting power. Sometimes messy is good.",2008
1,"During the first half to two-thirds of the film, the characters were building, which left one to think this was really going someplace, albeit slowly. Other characters were then added in completely unnecessarily. What was the purpose of the complete waste of time Woody Harrelson!? There were ends left flopping in the breeze that you thought surely would tie down as some point, but never did. The storyline was all over the place. Although you know who kills the main character, the creators of this film didn't see fit to show or explain how that came about, which was an important part of the story. It felt strongly like that scene just wasn't included because it would have been too much trouble and/or expense which was cheesy and lame. Tommy Lee Jones, who you expect to be significant was rarely seen or heard from and was downgraded to some form of powerless hick dreamer. Josh Brolin is very nice to look at but didn't have much of a story to act. His character exhibited some semblance of intelligence but never looked for an electronic tracking device in the loot! The Spaniard, Javier Bardem (Anton) did a decent job of pulling off creepy and I'm sure we'll be seeing much more of him in America. The last scene made me scream - ""This had better not be the end!"" But alas, it was! I have passed the DVD on to friends, but felt the need to be apologetic when I did so. It is astounding that this film got the awards & recognition it did. This rates right up there with Lost in Translation, Eyes Wide Shut, and Monsters Ball. The voters must be pod people.",2008

1,"I think the Coen's need to go back to film school and learn the basic rules of film making. One of which is that you never leave the audience hanging like they did with this production. All the actors delivered a great performance, but it is hard to do any great acting job when the Directors keep killing off the characters just as they start to get interesting. I set through this movie and just when it started to really get interesting the whole thing ends without even leaving it up to the audience to decide what would happen next as their was nothing to decide on. That was what the story was supposed to accomplish and failed to do. It just goes to show that what Hollywood is really lacking these days is ""Talent"". The new generation of film makers is either to lazy to come up with an interesting story line and decide that it is easier to make a re-make of an old classic just because the screen play is already done or in this case they are trying to be funny by just leaving out an ending to the whole movie. I would hope that they would have some excuse like they were over budget and just ran out of film, but to end a movie as they did without a conclusion to the story is not only very disappointing to the theater goer, but very stupid as well. Just my opinion, but this was one movie that I did demand my money back as it seems they were just missing the last reel. Go see it though and you be the judge for yourself. Enjoy! Yours in the movies.",2008

I thought it was pretty good, with some really different ways for a hit-man to kill folks. But, the ending was so horrible it ruined the entire movie. I think the writers just flat ran out of material and decided to run credits. You are left not knowing how one major was killed; not knowing for sure if an actress was, in fact, killed and not knowing what happened to either the stash or the money. Tommy Lee Jones has always been one of my favorite actors but, in this piece of trash, I don't think he was on screen for much over 15 minutes total and his part basically had nothing at all to do with the so-called story. All I can say is - YUCK!!!!",2008

Stardust, based on a novel by Neil Gaiman, showed up in theaters this week with little more than a peep. I saw no previews for it, only a couple of commercials. The critical reaction is kind of blah. I wouldn't even have seen it if not for the fact that I have to wait on a friend to see The Bourne Ultimatum, and that nothing else interesting opened this weekend. Well, if you'll forgive the horrible pun, the stars must have been rightly aligned, because I went to see Stardust, and I loved it. It's not a huge movie like Lord of the Rings. The plot line is your very basic fantasy quest (the hero sets out to look for a fallen star) filled with obstacles. But within that basic outline, the story is lively and imaginative. It's simply aiming to be a lot of fun, and a charming little romance. And it succeeds wonderfully. There were a lot of big films this summer, but none of them were nearly as fun as this one. There's a lot going on, but the story is told well and is almost entirely coherent. It isn't a masterpiece, but it definitely can occupy the same kind of ground that something like The Princess Bride has (though I don't like it quite as much as the earlier film).

Exciting, hilarious and equipped with wonderful imagery as well as unforgettable characters, Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert DeNiro's especially, I challenge anyone to watch this movie without a smile. From the first ten minutes of the film you know perfectly well how it will end, but it is the journey and not the destination that enthralls the viewer from start to finish.",2007
7,"Let's start by saying I loved the book by Neil Gaiman and recommended it often. Stardust was a very good fantasy movie in the vein of the Princess Bride with its whimsical tone and romantic aspects. Deniro was great fun in his pirate role that wasn't even in the book! As a matter of fact, all the actors were excellent. I wish that they had more fantastical creatures (like the book) and especially that they had not changed the ending of the book, it would have made it much more memorable. A few tweaks here and there, closer adherence to the original source material and it would have been a great classic for the ages. Tim Burton would have been perfect to direct this as I'm sure the original book would have appealed very much to his sensibilities. However, it was a worthy effort nevertheless. It's definitely worth a rental and a purchase if you like fantasy movies with romantic overtones.",2009
10,"The beautiful story of Stardust is written by by Neil Gaiman (writer of MirrorMask) and it's really a good story. I think it would appeal to any Labyrinth, Princess Bride or 10th Kingdom fan and yet it's totally unique and stands up on it's own. And I feel the film adaptation of this story has a far better ending than what was presented in the original novel by Neil Gaiman. I won't spoil it for you.",2007
10,"While I don't consider myself a big fan of fairy tale movies, Stardust intrigued me based on seeing Michelle Pfeiffer in the trailers as a villain (especially since I was about to see her as the bossy Velma Von Tussle in Hairspray). Boy, is she so convincingly evil here as a witch, especially with her age-ugly makeup in the beginning and end! Robert De Niro is also great as the pirate captain who's forced to hide ""in the closet"" to protect his ""reputation""! Just about all the actors like Claire Danes, Rupert Everett, Ricky Gervais, Peter O'Toole and many others do fine work here. While Danes and Pfeiffer are classic beauties, there's also stunning faces of Sienna Miller, Olivia Grant (as Girl Bernard), and Kate Magowan especially when we first meet her. Newcomer Charlie Cox is fine as the lead Tristan and he looked so much like his father Dunstan as a young man that I thought that was him in early scenes with Magowan (actually Ben Barnes). Many comments have compared this to The Princess Bride and while I can see some resemblances, the main difference was that with PB, you always knew it was just an imaginary tale as told by an old man to his grandson. Stardust makes you believe, for the most part, that what you're seeing and hearing could have actually happened even with all the hilarity that happens throughout. So on that note, I highly recommended Stardust.",2007
9,"I went into this film with modest hopes, the director had pedigree, I had seen Charlie Cox in Casanova and was impressed, and literally EVERYONE had been raving about it. As the story started to unfold I was introduced to Victorian England on one side of a mysterious Wall, and on the other a magical land, Stormhold. The actual plot weaves together many strands and I don't want to ruin the surprises for anyone, but at the barest it is the simple tale of a young man (Charlie Cox) in love with the village beauty (Sienna Miller). To win her love he tells her he will fetch back a fallen star from the other side of the Wall. Howver when he arrives at the star he finds not a lump of astral metal as he expected but a beautiful woman (Claire Danes). As the two journey back to the wall they find themselves in the adventure of a lifetime. The visuals are brilliant, England looks stunning, in a similar fashion to New Zealand in LOTR, and it s full of wonderful little flourishes, such as the way that the star shines when she is happy, a very simple effect, but one that looks radiant. As well as this the acting good, especially from the leads and Robert DeNiro, whose turn as the captain of an airship is incredibly memorable. This film is THE perfect date movie, it is romantic without being a ""chick flick"", funny and full of wonderful action pieces that will satisfy any action film fan. All in all it is a truly magical experience from beginning to end, and I now Im raving about it to EVERYONE!",2007
9,"I anticipated this movie to be decent and possibly cliché, but I was completely wrong! Charlie Cox (I had never heard of him until now) played an incredibly good leading man; he was so earnest and romantic, me and my friend that saw the movie with me totally fell in love with him.",2007
7,"Greetings again from the darkness. This one will be compared to ""The Princess Bride"" and although it doesn't measure up to that classic, it is extremely entertaining and well made in its own right. The story line is a bit odd and the whole wall thing is never really explained, but the execution is fine, even building up strong suspense.",2007
7,The reason I say indirect because this movie actually has a purpose besides just being funny. As well the humor is never just over the top but simple and in the correct places.,2007
9,"Somehow a fair few of films that I really enjoy have had some part of their advertising which made me expect the worst of them. The original Shrek was one of these, with the images of goofy characters grinning stupidly at me from each and every poster there was no way on earth that I was going to see such a film. However when my sister brought it home on video and played it over and over again I was gradually sucked into it, drawn by it's satirical humour and great characters.",2007
7,"Barring a largely inappropriate soundtrack, rather tedious tracking shots and some poor choices in CGI, this is the summer's most charming movie.",2007
9,"""Zodiac"" may frustrate viewers who come to David Fincher's latest film expecting a traditional serial killer thriller. The film begins with a couple of hair-raising and rather brutal recreations of murders carried out by the mysterious killer who terrorized the San Francisco Bay area in the late 1960s and early 1970s. These early scenes are shocking and, compared to the rest of the film, disorienting, because they offer the only time that we come close to seeing events from the killer's perspective. As the film progresses, the Zodiac killer himself fades into the background, and the movie turns into a meticulous and engrossing document of the investigation to track him down, an investigation that includes countless blind alleys and false clues and which to this day has not reached a conclusion. I would be more prone to label the somewhat rambling screenplay as sloppy storytelling if I did not feel that Fincher tells the story exactly as he wants to. The elusive narrative works, because the film is about an elusive villain.",2007
8,"Usually when a film gets made about a media grabbing unsolved crime, the resulting movie tends to be overtly sensational and at best remotely connected to what really happened. Considering that director David Fincher's last film about a serial killer was the gripping but deeply disturbing Se7en, his take on the Zodiac killer almost seemed primed to be an extreme, nail-biting thriller.",2007
10,"I have been highly interested and engrossed in the Zodiac killer story for the last 5 years now and I can say, without doubt, that this is the best and most accurate telling of the story. The film presents numerous details that were unknown to me before seeing it. All of these facts and theories are thrown together in a way that strings the viewer along, you think it's someone, then you get new information and that person is no longer a suspect. Fincher really puts you into the life of a detective working on the case. You feel just as excited when new information comes about and are equally disappointed when it leads to another dead end.",2007
10,"First up (and it's already been said)...this film is not going to appeal to the crash-bang- wallop-attention-span-of-a-bored-gnat brigade out there. Having read a lot of the reviews here, everyone seems to be divided in two. Love it...hate it. Which way will you go?",2007
7,"Zodiac, David Fincher's film about the impact the San Francisco Bay Area serial killer's case had on three primary characters is delivered with great attention to detail and proper pacing. Zodiac is not a film that uses or relies on suspended disbelief to succeed and does not attempt to compress five years of story into one in order to keep viewers interested. Instead it relies heavily on the facts and uses all of its 158 minutes to present them in almost linear form and staccato fashion.",2007
9,Dark. Moody. Atmospheric. All words to describe a candlelight dinner with Johnny Betts. But these words can also be used to accurately describe David Fincher's latest foray into the serial killer genre.,2007
10,"The era in which Zodiac takes place bridges two eras in urban America. The Zodiac appeared on the tail end of a crime-spree that rampaged across the US in the late 1960's. His settling in the SF Bay Area may be one of a number of social phenomenons that pushed America's view of itself out of an innocent 1950's sensibility and into a harder and darker view that became more prevalent starting in the 1970's and into the 1980's. People, even in urban areas, used to be far more trusting of one another, friendly, and civil. Many of the events of the 1960's gave urban Americans a much more cynical and cautious attitude toward people they didn't know. Don't trust or talk to strangers. Better to sacrifice helpfulness than to wind up dead. People are out to take advantage. At least in urban areas nowadays, it seems, people are much less willing to take the risk to meeting someone they don't know, largely out of fear.",2007
8,"I am tired of people writing comments like this, ""Not Fincher's best"". Honestly who cares. We all agree that Fincher's best is either Seven or Fight Club, two outstanding masterpieces. There is a big margin between a film like one of those and a terrible film, and people don't seem to realize that. These people even do this with other filmmakers like Spielberg or Scorsese, the fact that these filmmakers don't reproduce Schindler's List or Raging Bull doesn't mean that their new stuff isn't good, or worth seeing. I think it is a stupid way to comment on a film, eliminating the critic's credibility. I was lucky enough to catch an advanced screening of Zodiac last night, and I must say that at first I was discouraged by two things, some of the comments I have read and the running time. However I am glad to say that I enjoyed this film, very much. It is a solid suspense thriller that pins you to your seat. Being a true story adds quite a lot to the experience, and besides, Fincher did a wonderful job is staying loyal to the story and at the same time adding his unique flavor to it. The cinematography, like every Fincher film, is great, the darkness and griddiness of the story are perfectly portrayed in the film's visual elements. I was surprised by the picture quality of the Viper, the digital camera with which this film was shot. Many people have been criticizing this choice, but I respect it, he is embracing a new technology and making it work. Of course its still not a match to 35 mm, but if quality filmmakers don't start experimenting with it, it will never be. Now the reason why this film falls behind Seven and Fight Club, I think, is because of a problem with the characters. They seem to be a little weak at times. The performances were great, especially Robert Downey Jr., but I think that this film falls short, when it comes to a true exploration of complex characters, which is the key to Fincher's previous films.",2007
10,"""Zodiac"" is a perfect match of visionary director and hard to condense material. James Vanderbilt did an admirable job of taking a larger than one life story and somehow adapted all these people and events (chronicled in Robert Graysmith's two thorough books on the subject) into a script that works. He should have received an Oscar nomination, along with Fincher, supporting actor Mark Ruffalo (portraying Inspector Dave Toschi) and of course, ""Zodiac"" itself for best picture. But the silly academy doesn't reward films like this often and I'll bet less than 20% of them even saw it! ",2009
10,"Audiences have waited a while for a new piece of work from Mr. David Fincher and now that hiatus is officially over. Straying away from his style that earned him a 'cult' following, he brings out a new side to himself, some techniques not yet observed in his repertoire.",2007
8,"Just a few days ago, my mom and I watched a documentary on the famous Zodiac killer and his victims. It was incredibly interesting so it got me thinking about the film Zodiac that was released this year and lucky enough it was released on DVD today so I rented it. My friend and I just watched it a couple of hours ago and really liked it, especially on how it ended and was over all shot. I thought it was kinda cool how it started off like a documentary type of movie, but then was turning into a thriller that kept you going and guessing, even if you knew the whole story.",2007
8,"I knew a good amount about this case going into the film as I always found the famous serial killer ones very interesting when I'd see a TV special about them on. It's also no secret that it's one of the few that went unsolvable to this day, so I really didn't know what to expect from a thriller that pretty much everyone already knows how it'll end. However ""Zodiac"" was made with a style that allowed the perspective to seem fresh, even if it ultimately wasn't. This is a must see for any true lover of real police work that gets down to the nitty-gritty of what detectives have to go through in actuality. No one's job is glamorized and in fact it's portrayed as the other way aroundpeople get fired, demoted, or simply go flat out crazy. What fascinated me so much about the 'Zodiac Killer' more than the other murderers I've heard about was how he kept changing his methods, which is the main reason why he was able to elude capture for so long. All in all this made for one excellent cinematic puzzle that remained that way.",2007
8,"Less pyrotechnics and more drama. As far as I'm concerned that is a major plus in a Fincher movie. Rigorous and long but compelling just the same. A script, finally, that is almost totally devoid of cheap shots in a story that lent itself for cheap shots. It reminded me a little of Richard Fleischer's The Boston Strangler with a major difference: most of us know the story remains inconclusive - well, I don't know if ""most"" I certainly did - but, strangely enough it doesn't detract from its fun moments of suspense and the thoroughness of the proceedings. Robert Downey Jr is superb, immediately recognizable and totally believable at the same time. Jake Gylenhaall's connection with us - the audience - is strong and powerful as well as Mark Ruffalo's cop. All in all one of Fincher's most serious, and best films.",2007
6,"*This comment may contain spoilers, but I tried to be as vague as possible, and I think that this movie actually improves if you more or less know the ending.*",2007
9,"David Fincher has made a good career for himself making thrillers, Se7en and Fight Club both excellent films. Zodiac is another fine addition to Fincher's filmography.",2009
10,"I admit, I was skeptical that a movie could be made about a 10+ year long murder investigation with very few actual murders and no arrests. I was even more skeptical that it could actually be funny, which I'd read in a review was the case.",2007
8,"The characters are compelling, be they reporter, cop or possible killer. Jake Gyllendall gives the best performance. His character takes over the last third of the film, as he gets close to the likely killer(s). A cat and mouse scene with Jake's character at one of their homes had me twisting my napkin into shreds. The outdoor shots of San Francisco make artistic use of vibrant dark colors at night, and glowing pastels during the day. The interiors capture the maze-like process the detectives and reporters must navigate. The murder scenes reminded me of Bonnie and Clyde. ",2007
2,"Right up until the release of Panic Room, David Fincher could do no wrong. It's truly all over now.",2007
3,"I saw this because of the positive reviews about it. I have to say I have never heard of Zodiac before this, and didn't really care about the facts when I heard about them in this movie. However that's what this is all about. The whole script, written by someone who grew up in the area at the time and was fascinated by the Zodiac killings, painstakingly and painfully follows the investigation for him. Every ten minutes, the film cuts to a random date in the future (and tells you) when the next interesting event happens. It is like a blow-by-blow reconstruction. There really is no dramatisation at all. Even by the time of the second murder, the scene was dragged out so much, you wish Zodiac would just get on with it.",2008
1,"Se7en and Fighclub are great movies. David Fincher's latest, Zodiac, has been getting great reviews. I couldn't wait to see the movie. About an hour or so into it, I couldn't wait for it to end. It really angered me. I kept thinking, how could so many critics love this? How come I'm hating it so much?",2007
1,I just don't understand this high rating for Zodiac. There has to be some kind of mistake. I saw this with a group of friends when it first came out and there wasn't any one of us who remotely liked this movie.,2007
1,"The story of the Zodiac could have been interesting but this movie proved to be a two hour and forty minute bore-fest. Most of the movie is spent on the investigation as scene after scene piles on pieces of evidence for the characters to ponder. The movie tries (and fails) to show you how the investigation adversely affected the lives of a reporter (played by Robert Downey Jr), a homicide inspector (played by Mark Ruffalo), and a cartoonist (played by Jake Gyllenhaal)  hence the poster's tag line ""There's more than one way to lose your life to a killer.""",2007
1,Is there some kind of David Fincher fan club stuffing the ballot box here at IMDb with 10 ratings? This director can make a great film. This isn't it. Not even close.,2007
1,"Two hours and forty minutes with at least an hour of looking at my watch is not what I want when I go to a movie. There's a half hour sequence which goes nowhere... Which is the point of the movie, I think, that life goes nowhere. The look of Zodiac is flat and empty... Which is the point of the movie, I think, that life is flat and empty. Zodiac's ending is underwhelming... which is the point of the movie, I think, that life is underwhelming. This is the kind of movie that film critics love... while audiences who've actually paid to see the movie will hate. I know I did. After a while you start to think the acting is pretty good because there is nothing else to look at. But there's no getting around the fact that Jake Gyllenhaal is just plain awful. You don't believe him for a second. Save your money, stay at home, sit in a dark room and just think about how bleak, underwhelming, flat and empty life is.",2007
10,"I have seen it written that this film shows that Fincher has grown up! And whilst I understand that train of thought, it simply isn't true. What Fincher has done is give a true story his meticulous care and standard deft precision by leaving no stone upturned. We get simply one of the (if not thee) best films to deal with the investigating process of a high profile serial killer, a film that as a character study is actually essential cinema in this viewers humble and honest opinion.",2008
9,"I disagree with all those who say this is a teen-only drama. When I first saw the trailers and accompanying hype, I steered clear of it as it looked like yet another teen programme. But then I watched the second episode, about Cassie the anorexic, and was hooked. It managed to be both funny and touching - so much so that I cried at the end.",2007
10,"When this show first came out, i saw the trailer on the TV and thought it looked absolutely rubbish. However when the series one DVD came out my mum (yes my mum likes skins! and she's 42!)said that i might want to give it a chance. So i did and it's fantastic, nothing like i thought it was going to be. I don't see why some people have got all flustered about it exaggerating teenager's lives. Im 18 and personally my life is nothing like that of the skins bunch, but the show didn't set out to depict real life. It's an entertaining and funny show with a surprising amount of depth sometimes. If you have a sense of humour this show will appeal to you, if you don't or you have a very selective sense of humour then give it a pass or expect to be disappointed. Skins is what you make it, take it or leave it, it's up to you.",2008

In third season they got a character called thomas which helped a lot to ruin skins because he was totally unnecessary.",2011

10,"In 2007, i sat down to watch the first series of ''Skins'' not really knowing what to think before it started but as it did i found myself getting more involved in the characters lives and was able to place myself into there situations. Absaloutly superb acting by all of the cast, young and older, Fantastic script, Outstanding communication with the young public and faces the real life problems young people face these days. About a Boy's Nicholas Hoult is amazing, i was blown away with his performance as Tony, a moody teenager that has two sides to him, spiteful and sweet, Mike Bailey also gives a great performance as his shy character Sid Jenkins who is slowly evolving into more of a confident character because of Cassie (his girlfriend) played by Hannah Murray who in my eyes gives one of the strongest female performance's in Channel 4 history, she gives her character an unusual, almost spooky gift about her. Kind of' creeps you out a little but you can tell she is sweet in heart. One of the strongest male performances in the show is played by Dev Patel , who in the show is Anwar, the desperate for a girlfriend Asian teenager who is best friends with the gay character Maxxie, played by Mitch Hewer, who in my opinion gives one of the best male performances in TV history, outstanding! I was blown away by his performance in the stalker storyline with Sketch, who also gives a brilliant performance.",2008
10,"When i 1st saw the original advert for skins on E4 back in late November of 2006 i thaught, i have too see this program :) i don't watch much TV, but the one main reason i go downstairs on a thursday night, is for this program, it is original with a amazing cast and script, ",2007
9,"I thought Skins was fantastic! Although a little far fetched at times its still entertaining and funny too. Even though its targeted at people over 18, being 15 I think this program totally appeals to my age group (for all the wrong reasons). I certainly do hope they do another series, you can relate someone you know to all of the characters and has gaped a hole in English comedy!!! I certainly suggest it and check out E4's website, you can learn much more about the characters and extra clips. Overall my favourite aspect of the program are the characters especially Maxxie and Tony! - warning this program contains strong language, sex and a plethora of drug references",2007
7,"the first series is simply brilliant. The acting is actually quite good, you get the feeling that most of them are just like their characters. But skins isn't about acting it's about finally giving teenagers something to watch that we can really relate to.",2008
4,"I've tried really hard to like Skins, I really have, but time after time I find myself cringing at the elements of Skins which are (in an exaggerated fashion)reflective of everything the average British teenager secretly despises. No, really.",2008
2,"This is a television series that just makes kids think that what they're seeing is how they should be. Aside from the shoddy writing and primary school acting apparently they have a party every week, sex causes and solves problems and the stereotypes of a teenager are being fulfilled while everybody laps it up. If it is supposed to reflect normal life or show the gritty side of it, it really does not. I am living in the skins generation and I know nobody that would even vaguely represent any of the characters in any series of this show.I don't want to go into every single minuscule detail (of which there are many) of why i dislike this show i just wanted a sane view among the myriads of ""skins saved my life"" and all the rest of that bullshit.",2009
9,"I caught up with Skins on a repeat showing, not even realising at first it was the same show. I'd found the first episode easy to dismiss during the initial fuss and media fanfare ",2008
10,"Every two years, the cast is replaced. But I have loved all three generations. The first group is a favorite because they're what drew me into the show. It was just so different from anything else I had seen. A lot of people said that it was too much and the US remake didn't get the response it could have. Not all parents in America realize how beautiful Skins is. The UK version was better by far. There's so much character development in so few episodes. Each episode left me wanting more. But when the two seasons ended and the cast was replaced, I was somehow able to let go and fall in love all over again with a new group of people. Unlike many others who think the show has gotten worse over the years, I feel like it's just as good as the first season. There's really so much beauty in this show but some people can't see past the sex and drugs. Skins is so real. It makes me feel like I'm not the only teenager in the world with problems that other shows and people try to sugar coat. I feel like I'm not alone when I watch Skins; it feels like I'm a part of something. Of course the show is over dramatic but it's a realistic dramatic. Tragic things happen to people, teens have problems, people do stupid things, but underneath all that there's a subtle message of love and hope. I have so much I could say about this show. Would I be dramatic if I said watching it may have changed my life? Probably, but I believe it to be true. I choose to see the beauty in Skins.",2012
10,"After re watching Series 1-4 for the third time, Skins still blows my mind how brilliant this show is. Skins has enough drama for all of those in need of that section and enough hilarious comedy to keep those involved who would otherwise stray away from a show with only drama. All of the characters are absolutely riveting and I can guarantee after watching either series that you will have at least 1, possibly more favorite characters that you are so attached to that you will feel every emotion they do and scream at your television (Series 4 finale anybody?). While there are a very small amount of hiccups that make you question the plot at times(A character getting into Harvard on an athletic scholarship after being expelled from school? Not likely), Skins is still an absolutely gripping ride that will leave you wasting a whole day going through a season of the show leaving your other plans for the day as only a fore thought. I urge anyone reading this who has not watched Skins to go on Netflix (instant stream!) or any of the 389561805 websites that stream Skins to watch the first season through. If the pilot turns you off, just give it the next few episodes until you find your character because once you are in, Skins takes you on a wonderful journey of character based ""dramedy"" that any fan of television should love.",2011
3,"Considering all the hype surrounding this show and the number of writers credited, it's one hell of a disappointment. The plot is practically non-existent, some of the scenes don't make sense and while the teenage characters take drugs, drink like fish and have sex (well two of them do) they're really two-dimensional clichés we've seen time and time again. There are no interesting female characters (you can tell most of the writers are men) but even the teenage boys are more like old men dressed up.",2007
10,"This is the best show I have seen in years... Great production values, excellent story lines, very good acting, engaging characters, and thorough plot development. I wish Skins aired in the US so I wouldn't have to watch it on my computer! BUT I can't believe they're switching casts for next season. Only 1 character from this season will be staying on. Since the show is produced for Channel E4, I guess they must want to save money. Clever idea - they already have an established fan base, and so many people in the UK already love the show... Now, they can start with an unknown cast and pay them next to nothing, compared to what they would have to pay the ""established"" cast. After investing time in the show and becoming attached to the characters, I am upset that Series 3 (""season 3"" as those of us in the US would say) is going to be totally different. Yet, I'm sure that it will still be an excellent show.",2008
10,"Skins is one of my favourite TV series. For me the first generation is the best, I just feel that you can connect with the characters in it, I mean not everything in it is everyday, but for me the characters emotions and just being a Teenager was something I could connect to. The best character I think is Maxxie, although he isn't a main character as such, I just felt like the problems he had with Anwar were the same as I have had. ",2015

4,"I watched the first series and found it bearable however as the series went on it became the most unrealistic show ever. Firstly, students in Bristol are not all rich posh kids from Clifton. Secondly, half the things they do are un realistic and a really negative way to look at students especially ones from Bristol. Thirdly, it is a ridiculous over the top stereotype and it claims to be realistic! Being a student in Bristol I know this is nowhere near how bristolian teenagers act, even the troubled ones! The trailers actually make me cringe now it's gotten really over the top. It would be better if they didn't make the characters so insane and portrayed them in a fairer way instead of saying they are drug obsessed stupid nymphomaniacs.",2009
5,"This show is quite amazing, but I don't quite understand why this show is now rated 18+. I find this quite odd, I'm still a teen, and I suppose the creators believe that even teens are too young to see the sex and drugs and all, but we learn about all this at our teen years, so the 18+ is pretty much useless. This show shows a lot, and the best characters in my opinion are Cassie: for the female role and Maxxie: for the male role. I'm actually gay myself, but I'm quite the opposite of Cassie, I like food and all, but I can't seem to stop myself from eating crap foods. ",2007
9,"Skins is starting to air, censored, in the USA on the cable TV network ""BBC America"" (a great channel but I wish it were carried in high-def by Comcast!). I'm a fan of many, many British programs and, well, here's yet another top-notch show. I've gotten 'hold of the DVDs so I can watch it without the inane censoring. This is a funny show with good acting and fine character depiction. It's sharper than most shows and the characters really draw you in. I'm adding it to Monty Python, Little Britain, Dr. Who, Green Wing, Coupling (the British version, of course), Fawlty Towers, Not Going Out, and dozens more shows (not to mention Led Zeppelin, the Beatles, the Who, Elvis Costello, Queen, etc., etc. -- really, 2/3 of all my favorite musicians) as further evidence that you Brits create great entertainment way out of proportion to our countries' relative populations.

10,I have to correct the comment below when they say it probably wont get a second series...there will be! Thankfully!,2007
10,I've never posted a comment regarding a movie but feel compelled to after attending a screening of Into The Wild at the Toronto Film Festival last night. I won't speak to story here as it's covered in the other comments.,2007
9,"Sean Penn's new movie Into the Wild arrives on the wave of a well-regarded novel about a college graduate who decides that the anger and violence in civilized society is too much to handle and commences a journey through nature in order to truly live life as it was meant to be. This film is a wonderful glimpse into the life of a kid, wise beyond his years, and the bonds that he creates with people along the way. A victim of excess in wealth and a shortage of love, Christopher McCandless hid inside his mind behind knowledge and philosophy, building up his intellectual strength, as well as the physical, in order to complete his trek, ultimately leading him to Alaska. Penn never falls into the trap of showing too much heartbreak on the side of McCandless's parents, because he doesn't want the audience to second-guess the decision he made. There is no debate to be had here, our protagonist has no alternative but to get out and live off the land. Only being completely self-sufficient can he grasp a meaning for his life and one day perhaps go back with that knowledge fully learned.",2007
10,"The sensitivity with which Krakauer captured the essence of McCandless and his adventure is extended aptly to the movie format by Sean Penn. Even if one might not be able to appreciate the purpose for Alex's journey, I don't think anyone would be able to deny that Into the Wild is a sensitive and poignant cinematic experience. There are scenes in this movie that one will never be able to forget, particularly the ending sequence. This movie will easily pull its audience into a philosophical debate for the truth about who was right and wrong isn't easy to distinguish. Sean Penn certainly doesn't try to answer those questions, questions that McCandless' life left for his family and the rest of us. Penn does well to tread a delicate objective but not indifferent line. Certainly the best movie of this year and one of the best ever made. The story, the story itself is great.",2007
10,"For a movie to be even better than a good book is no small feat. Yet, that's how I felt after watching this film. It really impressed me. One of the reasons is the fantastic cinematography. Man, this is a beautifully filmed and, at 142 minutes, there are a lot of great scenes to admire.",2009
10,"INTO THE WILD definitely works as a film - I had read the book so I certainly knew the tragic story of this young man's life but I was blown away by the performances. In fact, to have this young talent Emile Hirsch working with the old, legendary Hal Holbrook makes the film a must see - in fact, their scene near the end in the truck is one of the best pieces of acting I have ever seen on film - Holbrook is amazing there. He deserves a Best Supporting Actor nomination (but probably won't get it). The film is by no means perfect - there are pacing problems but Penn does use the flashbacks incredibly well and the film builds power as it goes along. Hirsch is so real - I remember noticing how talented he was in the indie flick Dangerous Life Of Altar Boys and I also thought he was very good in the so-so Alpha Dog film. But Penn gets a terrific performance out of him as well as Catherine Keener, Vince Vaughn, Wm. Hurt, Kirsten Stewart, jena Malone and everyone else for that matter. I can see how this film might not be for every one, but I was very moved by it and days later - certain images and moments stayed with me. Penn is getting better as a filmmaker with each movie he makes.",2007
10,"I read the book in 1996. Like others, it moved me profoundly. I created a series of prints of my interpretation of Chris. I haven't read the book since.",2007
1,"This is the true story of Christopher McCandless, a college graduate who becomes a bum and eventually bites off more than he can chew by taking on the Alaskan frontier.",2008
10,"Honestly let me just say this 1st Sean Pean made this story come to life, true life in every moment in the film. This movie has nothing wrong with it, it is perfect in every way shape and form. He did something that brought me to something I never could understand of what either i have to do or what i need to do in my life. If you want a movie from the heart this is it, if you want a movie of love this is it, if you want a movie with real life emotions well this is all of them. Its long but you'll probably want more when you don't want to leave your seat and just live in the moment of they story. So from my heart to yours this movie will speak to you know matter what.",2007
1,"I live in Alaska and have for over 20 years and I have hiked, fished and hunted all over this state for most all of it. I lived here when the events of this movie happened. Christopher McCandless was not a hero or anything of the sort and to portray him in this way in this movie and to gloss over the insanely irresponsible actions he took that led to his completely unnecessary death and only invites other misguided ""wilderness advocates"" to do the same.",2007
1,"This film is a 1...at best. I will never, not ever, get the time back that I wasted watching this dreadful film. I am completely perplexed as to how this movie scored an 8?! I can only assume that no one else saw the film that I saw. Coming from Sean Penn, I should have known it would be filled with left-wing, anti-government bulls#!t. To be frank, the film is nothing more than the bastard love-child of Dead Poets Society and Grizzly Adams...except suckier. ",2009
8,"Who Is Chris McCandless? A true supertramp? An obsessive, emotionally damaged egomaniac? Suicidal thrill-seeker? A Kerouac-like drifter addicted to the search for an ever-evasive truth? A high-functioning schizophrenic? The 21st century youth culture reincarnation of John Gault? Or just a kid going through a difficult time and looking for some distance to sort it all out? ",2008
8,"I watched this movie on the aeroplane after searching through the movie list and not finding anything else interesting to watch. I didn't even know what the film was called until the ending credits. However, what I saw was amazing - the acting and scenery was excellent and the plot was thought provoking. More people should watch this to appreciate the message to us all. I was also surprised to see it was was actually a true story which made it even more interesting (I love films that are based on true stories). It is one of the best movies i've seen that portrays the contrast between a materialistic world vs the natural world that is at the core of the universe. This is a film that can easily be overlooked but not forgotten.",2008
3,"Besides the cinematography and music I completely hated Into The Wild. The following is a list that expresses this hatred toward the glorification of Chris Mccandless, a mentally unstable kid who runs away from home. Spoilers. 1. Chris teaches us that when you have problems at home, just run away. 2. Apparently he and his sister are the only kids to ever have to deal with fighting parents. 3. How could he just leave his sister? He obviously loved her and took care of her. But no, he leaves her there with his psycho parents. Never writes her or anything. 4. He was too scared to stand up to his father. He just ran and hid when his dad hit his mother. 5. He turned down a brand new car from his parents to keep a piece of crap. 6. ""I don't need money."" Umm lets see he needed money for a kayak. He worked for Vince Vaughn and Burger King for money so he could make it to Alaska. Just a little hypocritical there. 7. Apparently being a free-spirit makes you an expert kayaker. 8. Everyone he meets is the absolutely nicest person you could ever meet. 9. The male hippie's lines are laughably bad. 10. Male hippie tells Chris that he and female hippie are not doing good. Chris talks to male hippie for about 20 seconds and then goes swimming with female hippie. Male and female hippie go back to being completely in love. 11. The amount of times the word ""Alaska"" is uttered is just annoying. 12. Without the abandoned school bus he would have made it about a week. 13. Living in an abandoned school bus is not exactly living off the land, forgetting society. He slept on a friggin cot, had a place for a fire, and had sufficient shelter. 14. Man. Sitting there by yourself in an abandoned bus in the freezing cold. That's living man. Wow. 15. He thought he could make it in the Alaskan wilderness with no map. 16. His story is basically now a tale of what not to do with your life. 17. The only real thing he learned from his adventure is that ""Happiness is only real when shared."" Umm ya think? There's probably other ridiculous stuff from this movie that I forgot about. This movie makes this kid into some kind of hero when the only thing he accomplished was committing suicide.",2008
1,"As a parent who's reasonably liberal and open-minded I was nevertheless repulsed by the incredibly self-serving main character and director Sean Penn's unsubtle and cloying anti-government/anti-commercialist bent. McCandless may have been a straight-a student but he didn't learn a bloody thing in college. The writings of Byron, London, Tolstoy, Thoreau i.e. are taught as a jumping off point toward self-determination and adulthood. They are not meant to be literally emulated as lifestyles.",2007
1,"What is wrong with you people? This is a Walt Disneyesque revision of a spoiled kid's misadventure into self-indulgence. It's a shame he died for being righteous and stupid...and that's about it. It's a shame. But not a particularly interesting story, and a ridiculous one for a film filled with swirling helicopter shots and endless musical montages that are supposed to make you think the smirking Mccandless is some kind of modern Siddhartha.",2007
1,"This really stupid glorification tribute film financed by the extremely wealthy McCandless whose son died a futile death from poisoning , starvation and overexposure in the Alaskan wilderness. ",2008
9,"Sean Penn's 'Into the Wild' is a passionate and faithful evocation of Jon Krakauer's book about Chris McCandless. It's the troubling and complex story of a young idealist and seeker who was also a rebellious child and beloved brother who gave away his $24,000 savings to Oxfam after college, went off in an old Datsun and left his family behind, and disappeared for two years wandering the country, only to be found by hunters dead of poisoning and starvation in an abandoned bus in the wilds of Alaska.",2007

9,"""Atonement"" is structurally comparable to a three-act play, with a brief epilogue. The three central characters are Briony, the younger daughter of the wealthy Tallis family, her older sister Cecilia and Robbie Turner, Cecilia's childhood friend. Robbie is from a humble social background (his mother is one of the family's servants), but academically brilliant, and Mr Tallis has paid for him to be educated through grammar school and Cambridge, where he has obtained a First. A brilliant future seemingly awaits him, in whatever profession he chooses, and he wants to pursue a career in medicine. ",2007
8,"I saw a preview of this film yesterday and felt privileged to be one of the first people to see the film. It was also a pleasure to see a film before reading any other critical review or opinion. I am a great fan of Ian Mcewan and was concerned that it would not be possible to capture the subtleties and nuances of Mcewan's writing but I needn't have had any worries. The director, Joe Wright and screenplay writer Christopher Hampton have done a superb job and the complexities of the novel are superbly captured with real imagination. The story is set in three main areas, an English country house in 1935, war torn France 1940 and London 1940. The atmosphere in of all three are wonderfully captured by the director, cinematographer, costume design and score and I am sure that there are going to be some Oscar nominations for these. James McAvoy as lead man gives a tremendous performance of a restrained but passionate man. I was not as convinced by Keira Knightley's performance and am not sure that her acting has the mature edge to capture the social nuances of the times that McAvoy did so successfully. Do not see this film if you like fast paced films and rapid plot development! This is not a film for the pop video generation. If however you like character development and a plot that unravels at a pace that allows you to be immersed in the atmosphere of the film then I can highly recommend Atonement as one of the best films that I have seen this year.",2007
9,"13-year-old Briony Tallis is a girl with a huge imagination who loves to write. The film starts at her completion of a play, ""The Trials of Arabella"", a morality tale on love and the dangers of being too hasty with one's emotions. From her opening line in the prologue, various multisyllabic words that I didn't understand were employed, and the audience giggles at her pretension: evidently, this is a girl whose world is shaped with words, regardless of whether or not she understands them. Witnessing her sister Cecilia dive into a pool as their housekeeper's son Robbie watches after her, Briony pictures as scene she has no understanding of, and, by the end of the day, she will have changed lives for the worse, and she will spend the rest of her life regretting and trying to atone this mistake.",2007
10,"I usually don't like watching novels turned into movies (specially when I liked the novel as much as I liked McEwan's ""Atonement"") but this was a really pleasant surprise. The plot is extraordinarily well adapted, leaving out what cannot possibly be included in a two-hour film, changing very few details to translate literary language to cinematographic language but sticking to the essence and the spirit of the novel.",2008
10,"My wife and I went to see the movie last night and were totally blown away by the whole experience. So brilliantly directed and acted. The movie time just flew by and we were drawn in and captivated by each dramatic moment. Never having read the book or been an expert on WW2, I had a truly open mind on what to expect and I'm not one of those who count every rivet or go looking for technical inaccuracies however small. This was truly a masterpiece of cinematography. We were treated to wonderful performances, lavish sets, shocking and thought-provoking moments and haunting themes. I had the privilege of being an extra in the Redcar, Dunkirk scene and once seen in its full glory and effect on the big screen I was simply in awe and glad to have been a part of it. Walking along Redcar beach from now on will never quite be the same again. I am quite sure that the movie will win a number of awards within the next 12 months, but that is not what really matters. Movies are there to entertain, tell a story and affect you emotionally and by God this did it in spades! If you have not seen it yet, you must!",2007
7,"The first third of ""Atonement"" is superb. We are introduced to a group of affluent English aristocrats whiling away their summer hours at a massive estate. One of them, Cecilia (Keira Knightley), is nursing a raging case of sexual attraction to her childhood friend and now family gardener, Robbie Turner (James McAvoy), while another, Cecilia's young sister Briony (Saoirse Ronan), spends her day writing a play which she plans to perform for a family gathering later that evening. Everyone is bored and listless in the summer heat. Briony, prey to an overactive imagination, keeps witnessing a series of increasingly serious moments of intimacy between Cecilia and Robbie that she isn't old enough to fully understand, and finally a false accusation by her is responsible for sending Robbie away from the estate in handcuffs. Everything about this part of the film is brilliant. The director Joe Wright ratchets the sexual tension to an almost unbearable pitch, and I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen.",2007
9,My brain tends to turn to mush in the presence of greatness. This makes it difficult when I want to write about something that I thought was truly great. It is so much easier to write about something that is rubbish.,2007
10,"Its very rare that a movie like Atonement comes along and leaves me completely speechless and in complete and utter awe for hours after I have seen it. You see Atonement isn't just the best movie I have seen all year, its one of the best movies I have seen in a very, very long time. And by that I include Pan's Labyrinth, yes this movie is better than my favourite movie of 2006, and I never imagined Atonement would ever come close to that level of greatness until fifteen minutes into the movie last night. Atonement is an unusual movie, in fact its fair to say that I have never seen anything quite like it. Its a rare movie that actually I adored so much that I am going to hunt down a copy of the book tomorrow just to see the comparisons. Its not an easy movie I'll be honest, if you go in expecting something light hearted and easy to digest then you will leave the cinema feeling very cheated. This is a movie that deals with very dark things at times. No matter how much I desire to write in depth about every aspect of the movie I just can't, the movies greatest triumph is the fact that its plot is so intricately woven that if you ruin one part of the storyline to anyone then the movies impact is slightly lessened. The storyline is just brilliant, but its the climax that leaves you in store for the biggest shocker, and its this shocker that leaves you reeling long after you have left the cinema. The performances here are all spectacular, I think its fair to say that the two leads, James McAvoy and Keira Knightly shall be receiving at the very least nominations for Best Actor/Best Actress. The score is beautiful, whoever came up with the idea of using a typewriter as a musical instrument deserves to be praised heavily. Its rare a score leaves me feeling moved, the score in this movie did that for me. That's yet another Oscar that this movie deserves to win. All in all Atonement is just perfection, I doubt you'll find a better movie this year or even for the next three years. In a time when Blockbusters get all the attention it is nice to see a small, but intelligent movie leave me in awe.",2007
10,"I was completely stunned when I watched Atonement yesterday. From the funny lines to the sad moments, this movie does not fail to amaze me. James McAvoy is by far the shining star in this movie, endowed with unfailing charisma and absolutely adoring accent. The score was impeccable, especially the sound of the typewriter. I loved the scenes from Dunkirk, the hospital, and ,of course, the mansion. It's truly an amazing movie that I consider to be the best of 2007's. The ending was rather sad, but it fits perfectly. Keira Knightley was ineffably wonderful with her charming beauty and brilliant performance. One should really go and watch it because it's a fulfilling experience. I personally give it 10/10.",2008
1,"Bottom line about this movie, who cares? None of the characters are particularly sympathetic & since when does a couple who have a 60 second fling in the library, then don't see each other for 4 more years qualify as a ""great love story""? Oh, please.....The whole war footage was utterly confusing, and especially in the part of the cockney soldier, which is oddly funny. (Was that on purpose? If so, how very strange, if not, how very unfortunate). The ending, which just sort of suddenly lurches forward into present day, (lord, why did that poor Briony NEVER change her hairstyle?) is a huge bait & switch which cannot help but make you think that you've wasted two hours, essentially by being lied to. How on earth this film was nominated for so many Academy Awards, I do not know. The nicest thing I can say about this movie is that Ms. Knightly's green dress was truly stunning. Seriously, that's it..........",2008

Four years later, all three characters try to find their own personal sense of peace or redemption during WWII.",2007
10,"Based on Ian McEwan's award wining novel of the same name, Atonement tells the story of A British romance that spans several decades. Fledgling writer Briony Tallis, as a 13-year-old, irrevocably changes the course of several lives when she accuses her older sister's lover of a crime he did not commit.",2007
8,"The superb Ian McEwan book translated into cold beautiful images by the startling Joe Wright and scriptwriter Christopher Hampton. The result is a series of powerful rushes and abrupt stops. A pacing that, perhaps, is a bit too self conscious for its own good doesn't help us to connect the emotional dots. I had the feeling I had lost something in the love story of the protagonists - something that didn't happen to me reading the book. By the time the ""injustice"" takes place I was taken by the pain of the injustice but not by Knightley and McAvoy's liaison. Their love story is left to its own devices. The beauty of the images is overwhelming and the assuredness of Joe Wright at his second feature after the, much better, ""Pride and Prejudice"" keeps you going. The score tends to be monotonous and irritating but in spite of all that I intend to see ""Atonement"" again and I would recommend it with just the above mentioned reservations.",2007

1,I cannot adequately sum up into words the disappointment I felt after watching this film.,2009
9,"Well, from the trailers I could tell this would be an epic film before I was even able to see it. I managed to attend a gala screening of the film last night and I thought it was amazing. Despite my constant dislike to Keira Knightly, I was unable to disapprove of her acting in this film. She has improved massively since the first pirates film. The film itself has an intriguing plot line which keeps you hooked throughout. The film includes humour at the start and fascination by the end. I loved watching this film and I enjoyed the smartness of the story. The film is cleverly done with jumps in time and different perspectives of events throughout which will leave you understanding the motives of each character more. The music is composed beautifully, the orchestral tunes accompanied with the clatter that a typewriter makes creates a beautiful piece of music that fits perfectly with the film itself. I have since begun to read the book, the only thing that the film lacks is the character depth that a book can write about but a film simply can't explain. I feel that the film shows what happened but the book is able to explain a little more as to why the events occurred. Overall the film was beautiful, brilliant and emotional.",2007
6,"When ATONEMENT was released in 2007 I made a point not seeing it due to the hype . Critics were falling over themselves to judge the film a "" masterpiece "" and it's interesting that all these critics were British . When it comes to harmless shallow jingoism the British film critics are unique . While some countries have an obscene tradition of murdering people because "" they're not one of us "" the British lovers of art fawn sycophantically over the slightest piece of mediocrity if there's some Anglo-Saxon Celtic connection and since ATONEMENT is set in a pre war 1930s Britain with posh folk we have the archetypal class driven British movie that appeals to jealous egalitarian Americans . It was interesting that the film didn't do very well at the American box office and that despite receiving an avalanche of prestigious nominations it had a very small award from nomination ratio . This tells you something ",2012

Come on people, sure, Lola was in bad shape and needed help, but a houseful of people standing around asking a 13-year-old what she saw? Shouldn't their priority be to find the missing boys first? They can ask all the questions and point the fingers later. Cannot believe this scene. It's one of the earlier death knells for this otherwise ho-hum movie. The Awards people must have watched a different movie than the one I rented. Thumbs WAY down.",2010
1,With so many people raving about how incredible this film was I went to see it with high expectations. I wish I had not bothered. To call it over rated would be an understatement.,2008
1,"Every scene seemed to be set up with an eye to gaining an award for cinematography and all failed miserably, whereas a film like Hero really delivers. The Dunkirk scene was the most stylized, unreal and boringly looooong part of the film and all the London street scenes looked like inaccurate sets. So many pregnant pauses it could have had sextuplets! A waste of great actresses like Brenda Blethyn and Harriet Walter. Unfortunately, this film has got the critics eye and will no doubt clean up at the awards, another travesty. Interestingly nearly half the people who commented on this film hated it despite it's high score.",2008
5,"I taught Ian McEwan's novel as part of university courses in contemporary British fiction, so I felt differently about the film than my husband did -- my husband saw the movie without having read the book. I think ""Atonement"" is a valid and admirable attempt at filming a novel about writing. The use of the sounds of typewriter keys strongly conveyed Briony's development as a writer and the power of her testimony to destroy, the power of Robbie's passion to move Cecilia and shock Briony and her family's world, and the power of the mature Briony to enable Robbie and Cecilia to have in fiction the happiness that they could not have in life. My husband debated with me whether Briony's fiction can really give her sister and friend the life that her testimony took away from them, or whether the atonement is only in Briony's mind. The cinematography is excellent and the acting is superb: until I saw the credits I believed the 18 year old Briony was played by the same actress as the 13 year old Briony. However, the ending and the mature Briony's admission that she invented scenes in her supposed true account are unconvincing. Briony's interior life and her realization that other people are as alive and important as herself are not shown on screen. The shifts in time may be confusing for those who are unfamiliar with the novel. Both my husband and I found the movie slow and some of the scenes overlong, especially the scenes of Dunkirk. I wondered if the director lingered on them to show off the expensive shots of the thousands of extras. Ultimately it may be impossible to portray in a film many of the aspects of McEwan's novel, especially Briony's stories suggesting not only her own moral and professional growth but the growth of fiction throughout the last century. ""Atonement"" keeps most of the spirit of McEwan's novel until the closing scenes. Aside from the hurried coda, we both thought it was too sentimental and clichéd not only to close with a sequence of Robbie and Cecilia frolicking on the beach in front of the cottage they never shared in true life, but to set the cottage in front of the white cliffs of Dover.",2007
1,"The main thing I need to enjoy a movie is to like one or more of the characters. I disliked every single person portrayed in this useless and empty film. None of them had anything redeeming about their personalities or purpose in life. A good story helps too, which Atonement sadly lacked. My wife and I suffered through, hoping somehow a good ending would make up for a depressing bummer of a movie. We were sorely let down.",2008
1,"this movie is simply god awful.. this is exactly what is wrong with cinema, and many of the films that are recognized to be worthy of movie award consideration.. there is absolutely no subtlety whatsoever, and instead the viewer is pummeled by sappy dialogue, a pomposity of music.. and of course the carefully crafted yet oft used torrid love scene in a library as books collapse and the walls of passion come crumbling down.. there are very few original perspectives on a love story in this movie, instead we are subjected to keira knightly pouting her lips in the mirror in the beginning of the movie, calling on her wealth of acting experience from designer makeup ads..it's the same formula that seems to always garner attention from both the viewing public and the people that vote for awards.. a woman falls in love with a man of virtue from a different caste of society then her, feels guilty for doing so and therefore dismisses the man, then admits to her love and confirms at physically whilst being made love to against a bookcase, gets separated by a war, and living for the chance to see her man again and having more library sex... oh yeah and throw in the tragedy of keira knightly drifting to the bottom of the sea.. and you almost have the making of titanic part II.. once again the viewing public is duped into succumbing to the carefully crafted yet completely inauthentic Hollywood love story",2008
