10,"For those still in withdrawal from the cancellation of Arrested  Development, let me write you a prescription: Modern Family.  The comparisons are obvious and with good reason. The postmodern comedy  for the 21 century was ushered in by The Office(UK) and Arrested  Development, but I, for one, doubted something could come along and  satiate my longing for another truly, original comedy.  Albeit, you may initially be wary to see yet another mockumentary-style  show, but by the end of the pilot, you'll be smiling/laughing way too  hard to stay cynical. Thus far, the plot lines have been really fresh  and the characters are so, for lack of a better word, lovable. This  show fulfills all my comedy needs, and I feel like I must resort to the  listing of relevant adjectives: Witty, dry, smart, outlandish, silly,  clever, cute, sarcastic, subtle, not-so subtle. HILARIOUS.  I hate to say it, but the laugh tracks and raw goofyness of classic  sitcoms like 'Seinfeld' and 'Friends' are obsolete and leave something  to be desired. You will find that something in Modern Family.  And who knows, maybe some of the more painfully funny and poignant  scenarios will reveal insight into the changing dynamics of both the  modern family and modern comedy.  Great show. Period.  And let's get it right this time around: don't cancel good TV shows.  Pretty please?",2009
10,Modern Family is one of the best shows on TV in 2009.,2009
10,"I just want to say that I love this show!! It is good family entertainment. I believe all of us can relate to someone in it or have a relative that can. For those of you who only saw the pilot (which I watched by accident and loved)please don't give up on it, it is really good comedy. I can't decide who my favorite character is, Cam, Phil...all of them, each week another one cracks me up. I rarely watch TV but this one has me hooked. I agree that the format is much like The Office, which I also think is funny, but the shots to the camera, the expressions are some of the best parts. We have all of the shows on dvr because my daughter and I usually can't wait till the next Wednesday to see it again! Again...Best show in years!",2009
9,"When I saw summer promos of this sit com I thought it looked forced and very predictable. As Cam would exclaim, ""Surprise!"" It is well cast, written, and consistently laugh out loud funny. The documentary camera bit is actually as well done, no, even better than one of the best, The Office. I recognized most of the talented adult cast, they have great chemistry, and it was so hilarious when Shelley Long guest starred as the ex wife. But it is the kid actors on the show who are amazingly well directed in their parts- Manny, as a son, stepson, brother, uncle, and cousin is a hoot: he can wisecrack with the best of them, and then break your heart when dad isn't able to fulfill his promise for the weekend. I always thought Steve Levitan did agreat job with ""Just Shoot Me"", on NBC and I think he and ChristopherLloyd have got a hit show for ABC. Take a look at this so ABC won't cash in on some more ridiculous reality shows.",2009
9,"Because I have not one, but two, DVRs I'm able to give all the new shows a chance, which I did with ""Modern Family"". Am I ever glad I did!! I have found that everything about this show is believable. Though the situations that occur during any given half-hour show would obviously never all happen in that short a stretch, I have no difficulty in believing that they would all happen. I never feel that anyone's exaggerating to draw a laugh or milking a laugh. It's just the only ""laugh out loud for the whole show"" on TV today. It is, IMHO, the funniest show since MASH, and that's saying some.",2009
8,"I saw the trailer for this show a while back and was instantly intrigued. Shot in a ""mockumentary"" style it follows the lives of three couples who's various members are related as family members. Although the set-up is slightly cliché, a gay couple, a stereotypical family and a Columbian wife and son (from her first marriage) with her American husband, this is where the standard ends. The dialogue is fantastic and at many points I found myself really laughing quite loudly, something which is very rare for a TV show to accomplish for me personally. The casting is also spot on with the inclusion of Ed O'Neill (the infamous Al Bundy!), Ty Burrell, Julie Bowen and Sofía Vergara, with each actor really bringing something unique to the mix. I strongly recommend this show to anybody who appreciates good comedy, the ""to-camera"" sections of the dialogue have a very close resemblance to the original UK version of ""The Office"" and for those who are familiar with this, Modern Family will be a welcomed return. Great show, great acting, great script. Highly recommended.",2009
8,"I decided to check out ""Modern Family"" after hearing all of the critical praise about it. The show was five episodes in, so I caught up on the action online. And I must say that the acclaim is well-deserved. The show is nothing like what I'd imagined when I read about it. It is not a typical three-camera sitcom and it actually IS as gut-wrenchingly funny as people say.",2009
10,"Modern Family is an exemplary show. It's got everything to love in a sitcom. It has humor, heart, great acting, great writing, likable characters, I could go on forever. The jokes are sharp, believable and it's also not too hyper like a lot of today's sitcoms are. It has quieter moments. And not that I'm bothered by a laugh track, but it also understands that you don't need a laugh track to be funny. I love to watch it with my family every Wednesday. My family and I love it to death. It's as well one of those rare examples of a show that hasn't suffered from what I like to call ""SpongeBob Syndrome"" (With flanderizing characters, recycling episode plots, etc.). I definitely recommend it :).",2016
9,"I wasn't sure about this show. I liked Ed O'Neil and wanted to see him succeed in another comedy. I talked my girlfriend into watching the pilot episode and we laughed uproariously. The casting was so good. Ed O'Neil's delivery is absolutely pitch perfect. Ty Burrell is annoying but, in the perfect over-compensating way that you would expect from a dad who feels his Life has aged while he has remained a teenager. Julie Bowen manages to under play her role as Ty's annoyed and insecure wife. Sofia Vergara is absolutely gorgeous as O'Neil's younger, Latina wife. Jesse Tyler Ferguson and Eric Stonestreet are hysterical together. The show ties together so well each and every episode.",2009
1,Not funny at all! I gave this a chance and tried a few episodes but gave up. It's the opposite of laugh out loud funny! Why do so many people like this and why does it win so many awards? The situations are so contrived and exaggerated. People just stand around looking daft and some supposed joke takes place. Hate the camera work too.,2012
1,"This show is the worst. The writing is, as if someone took cliché and patronizing story lines and ideas, pasted them to a dartboard, lobotomized a chimp and let her go nuts with fecal matter. The best part is the flung excrement, has more substance than the show itself. Did no one notice the desperation of of the casting, and ensemble of washed up untalented, familiar faces to play into the insecurities and dullness of the American viewer. This work of unintelligible garbage should to laid to rest, to make room for anything else. P.S. Anyone who compares this piece of self-indulgent, dimwitted, cliché, exploited deleted, sycophantic waste of space to ""Arrested Development"" should seek a psychological exam, because you are probably entitled to Mental Disability benefits. This show should be cancelled immediately before American Families become any stupider.",2011
2,"I really don't know how people say this show is good. Believe me, it's not. I wanted to see this show because of the positive reviews it has received, so I watched the pilot first. It was boring, clichéd, and annoying. Even Ed O'Neill is bland and boring, that made me sad. The normal family (Phil Dunphy) is dumb and uninspired. The gay couple is stupid and annoying. I don't have anything against gay people, but the fat one is nothing less than annoying and disgusting. The other gay is OK, but he doesn't make me laugh at all. Sofia Vergara looks too much excited, like she's hyperventilating....it's really creepy. The kids are bland or clichéd at best. After the pilot, i though ""Well, it's the pilot...maybe the second one is better...."" Well, that's not true. Everything is bland and boring at best, or annoying and unbearable at worst. The characters, the story, the comic parts. Believe me, I tried to laugh with this...I couldn't. Now for the big picture.....there is no music whatsoever. It makes you feel like you're watching a home video, maybe that's why the series is boring. And finally the worst part.....the camera....it goes up, down, left, down, up, right.....so, who gave the camera to a 15 year old drunken kid? It makes me dizzy to watch this show, and with the story and characters, it makes me sick. I can't stand watching more than 5 minutes of this ""thing"" now. So, to summarize, DO NOT watch this series, there are better things out there...in fact, almost everything could be better than THIS!",2010
1,"I've only watched a few episodes from the first season, but, aside from not containing one iota of actual comedy, this is one of the most offensive shows ever created, and the writers should be castrated. One could understand if this were satire or black comedy, but it simply isn't anything, while it does succeed in offending practically every minority group on the planet, especially gays and hispanics. Instead of a real gay couple were served up with a couple of raving gay queens. Instead of a hispanic, were are treated to a modern day Carmen Miranda. But speaking as a gay person, this is the most offensive piece of garbage since Will and Grace. I know the networks have no class, talent or style in their work, but this is beyond all that. Simply pathetic!",2013
2,"Imitator Family steals everything bad from the last 60 years of television. From ""The Office"" it steals hurky-jerky rapid camera shifts to try to show it is ""new""; from ""I Love Lucy: it steals contrived plots that are completely unrealistic. From ""Steinfeld"" it tries to pretend it is a ""real-life"" show and thus about nothing, even though most sit-coms are about ""nothing"" and their attempt to turn them into something. And by taking plot devices from everything from ""Father Knows Best"" to ""Roseanne"" it tries to create laughs where there are none. While Ty Burrell and Eric Stonestreet play horrible stereotypes poorly, Ed O'Neill is good and Sofia Vergara is very good. However, in 10 years this series won't even be seen at 2 AM in syndication.",2013
6,"Scripted shows that employ a documentary format often use the P.O.V. talking-head shot as a gimmick to put more visual variety into the show, and to create a style of story-telling that they hope will keep your attention without having to improve the plot or characterizations. You can tell because they often go back to the interview at the most weakly-written moments. This is one problem, but not the major one, with Modern Family. The aspects that disturb me the most are these: they're supposed to be modern families and there are no working mothers (do the writers misunderstand the term ""post-feminist era""?) except for a few temporary jobs in single eps. Also there are no poor or even lower-middle-class characters. Actually, I do remember one character who was poor, but of course he was a one-time character on a Christmas episode. I'm sick of the characters whining about first-world problems like not being able to buy the ""perfect gift"" for their spouse on their birthday. What's so tragic about buying the iPad the day before or after their birthday? I realize this is a satire, but the writers don't seem to have that much contempt for the people they're satirizing. They don't seem to be TRYING to show how spoiled and self-centered many upper-middle-class are (it just comes out that way). That's not part of the satire, except maybe with the character of Haley (Sarah Hyland). Another thing that bothers me is that Claire (Julie Bowen) comes off as a lot crazier than the writers seem to intend. She's ALWAYS breathlessly freaking out, and it's more irritating than funny. In real life she's be at least an OUTpatient in some psychiatric facility. The gay couple (Eric Stonestreet and Jesse Tyler Ferguson) are gay stereotypes, especially Cameron, but since I hate political correctness and they're actually funny it doesn't bother me much. It would be nice, however, if the show did what it could to improve America's perception of gay people. Since Camoron is a prissy, whining, crying drama queen, the other character, Mitchell, could be the antithesis of a gay stereotype. The comedy could come from people thinking the character is straight. Manny's (Rico Rodriguez's) character doesn't resemble any human being on the planet. He's too cartoonish (sitcoms have always had kids who act like adults and adults who act like kids) and neither funny nor well-acted. On the positive side, Ed O'Neill is amazing as Jay Pritchett. As he was in ""Married, With Children"", he's like a comedy machine, delivering every line perfectly. To sum up, Modern Family is funny and entertaining but not particularly witty and intelligent, and uses a kind of soft-edged, sentimental satire that flatters, but doesn't challenge, the audience's ability to laugh at itself.",2012
1,"I have only seen one episode, thank god. No, you aren't the only one who doesn't think this show is funny. You also aren't the only gay man offended by the stupid gay stereotypes. Not all gay men are scaredy cats. The only stereotype I saw broken was the fat gay man. They should be really modern and include a skinny lesbian. Both gay guys were afraid to stand up for themselves. Good West Side Story reference though, it still did not come off funny. That about says it all. No, they insist I drag this out! no pun intended. Obviously the episode was unmemorable or it would be easy to have ten sentences. Or even more, since apparently they cannot count. How many more do you need?",2014
1,"This show is severely overrated. I admit it is occasionally funny, and the premise of the 21st century ""modern family"" is an accurate and humorous representation of today's familial diversity. However, the acting from the majority of the cast is so pretentious and falsely exalted I have to skip through the episodes on Hulu just to look for a laugh.",2012
1,"It's entertaining but it's not a classic sitcom or comedy series. You won't have any laughter-sounds in the background and it's not so funny compared to classics like Love and Marriage or Simpsons but it's somehow entertaining because the plot is usually quite original. The fact that Ed O'Neil has a major role made me watch this, he's still a good actor and somehow I grew up with him. The gay guys are quite annoying sometimes. It looks a lot like they try to make it a reality TV show but it's not, just camera moves around like that. Weeks after writing this review I had the feeling to add some things I highly dislike: This series promotes a very negative type of family and is full of subliminal messages and tries to brainwash you. They always put the beauty of the 2 mothers Julie Bowen and Sofia Vergara very much in front, character is not that important it's always more about their sexiness and makes them awful role-models. The gay-guys are nice people but this series tries to force the impression on you that a gay family with adopted child can work just sooo fine. The way they behave is always so nice and so typical TV-gay and nothing how real gay people behave. What bothers me the most is the way that those children are portraited, with their very feminine way of dressing and adult-like hairstyle they try to make them look like grown up women although they are children and trying to put a sexual focus on the three girls in this series. Especially the oldest daughter has her breasts almost hanging out of her clothes for the whole series and is usually slutty without regret. Even the youngest daughter (the Asian one) looks more like she is styled up for a ""young miss Texas"" contest than just being a normal little girl. Hands away from this Hollywood-Illuminati try to brainwash you and how you look at society.",2014
3,"I just bought this after a friend of mine recommended it, because it was supposed to be so funny. And maybe it is, I'm sure it is for some, but not for me, here is why: not one single funny character! the gay couple i super annoying, the fat guy is supposed to be funny because he is fat and dramatic, the colombian kid, funny because he's fat and acting like a grown up, not funny! the women in the series, sexy super cliché all the time, not funny! the kids, not funny. the father (son in law of Ed..) is the most funny character, but is sometimes over acting his part. To sum it up, i find the whole family kind of irritating. They're always hanging out together (who does that!), pretty, rich and perfect family. I feel more like throwing up than to laugh. In fact I haven't laughed since episode two (I have just watched season one..)Maybe this series works for rich white happy families who recognizes them self in the ""funny family situations"", people who just had a baby and think that kids are super funny just being kids. Maye I am just a little F#%d up for needing more morally deprived series like ""its always sunny in philly"", ""peep show"" or ""trailer park boys"" to get me to laugh:) I don't like comedy series to be about ""learning something"". It reminds me of a modern ""step by step"", but even though I disliked that series for the same things, they at least had some funny characters and good dialog.",2012
1,"I do not like too many of the newer 'comedies' (Well ""Big Bang"" is a fantastic show). This show just seems like everything is contrived and forced. I did try to watch 'Family' but kept vomiting - you all know how that is. With that in mind, questions do pop in my mind, like: Why all the awards? Good question. And Why all the hype? Another good question. People do like the show - that is obvious, so maybe I am just missing something. Wait while I ponder in deep ponderance mode. Hmmmmm, what would I do to this show to make me a fan? Let me see - a-HA! Maybe if the cast boarded a charter boat, and went on a short trip and ended up on an uncharted island. That is brilliant. Would I watch it then? Would I? Ah - nope. It is not what I am looking for and I just do not find it entertaining. Show stinks",2013
4,"While I enjoyed the first two seasons of MODERN FAMILY, the third is a bit tired. Very few funny lines and situations. They should have stopped while ahead. Two season would have been great. The acting is over board, even for a sit-com. The two gay characters are horrible...both the writing and the acting. Can't gay characters act like 'normal' human beigns???? They always bicker and how they've stayed together this long is beyond belief. And these guys were actually nominated for an Emmy. Who do they sleep with? Also annoying is Ty Burrel. Lousy actor in an inane role. He too was nominated?? Give me a break. Even for a sit-com, the situations for the most part are unreal. The camera work is also horrible. Trying to be like an art movie with all that hand held camera movement and zooming. Besides re-casting, they should stop with the 'fancy' camera work. After all I've said, I do enjoy the little girl who plays Lily. She's be best thing on it. Ed O'Neil also deserves some credit as he's the only one who acts with authority and humane qualities. As for Sophia, well, she's still great to look at and at times she comes through well, but stop with the screaming. As far as the kids are concerned...again, RE-CAST.",2012
2,"Produced in the mockumentary style popularised by embarrassment comedies like ""The Office""[1] and ""Parks and Recreation"" this take is far too tame and restrained to work. Those other shows savage the people whose petty lives they satirise. When the mockumentary camera is used to deliver a pure sitcom in ""Modern Family"", it reveals only that banality is... banal. That is, stripped of the cruelty and gloating of embarrassment comedy, all that's on show here is a tired parade of sitcom stereotypes. And when these stereotypes extend to race and sexual orientation, the result is truly repellent.",2014
1,"This show bothers me. And I can't fully articulate why I does in a concise way, but I guess I'll just throw out a bunch of very specific things that I can't stand in order to try and build the bigger picture: The first problem this show has is the heavily Auto Tuned sound of its ""singers"". I understand that several of the actors and actresses on this show are well trained and very talented in their own right, but the creators never let you know that. They take EVERY SINGLE VOCAL sung by anyone on this show and strip all nuance, dynamic and wavering pitch from it. These are computers we are listening to. Nobody sings ""perfectly"" but due to the unfortunate practice of ""fixing"" vocals in all modern music, this show makes possibly talented people sound like any hack singer who actually needs the pitch correction, and by doing so makes all performers on the show indistinguishable from one another (an odd decision considering how much this show would seem to promote individuality).",2010
1,"Season 1 was fantastic. The plot was amazing and the characters where like able (or at least relatable). Then season 2 came along. It wasn't as brilliant as season 1 but it was still enjoyable. Season 3 started well but then became a downward spiral. The characters were starting to loose what made them, them. I could still watch all of it but sometimes I just couldn't stand some parts. Now we're on season 4 and I just cannot stand the show anymore. I could barely make it through the first episode. The new characters are just awful and there's nothing like able. They tried to make a new Puck with Jake but they failed because no one can be Puck. I just wanted so bad to keep watching the show in hopes that it would get better but now I'm on episode 2 and I'm done. Season 1 episode 1 had me Immedietly but this newest season is a complete disaster. And worst of all is that all the returning characters have completely lost their spark. I wouldn't be surprised if the show got canceled after this season.",2013
4,I really wanted to like this show.,2011
5,"I was really pumped up for Glee after watching the pilot episode; it seemed like a promising musical comedy. However, throughout season one, I found myself facing disappointment after disappointment.",2010
10,Glee presents a nascent high school glee club ready to blossom with the right talent and encouragement.,2009
5,"I will say there is something about Glee that has managed to keep me coming back despite several misgivings. It certainly has no lack of talent and sheer desire to have FUN. However, the mid-season finale has really set me back once again.",2010
5,"From the Pilot to the latest episodes to have been released from the second season, last at this point being 'Original Song', there have been some major plot changes and the storyline has gone drastically downhill. It used to be a very captivating show that left you drooling and gripping your remote waiting for the next Tuesday night just so you can see what happens next and how it will progress. Giving such life to Kurt, Puck, and other characters who weren't spotlighted on in the first season, it became something that you had to see to watch the underdog rise up. It was a truly inspiring underdog story. In such a short period of time and 45 episodes into the hit T.V. show they have turned it from captivating story to ""when is it going to get good again?"" They have killed any interesting characters in a metaphorical sense, and destroyed any plot that may have been and replaced it with something that looks like ""what can we do to put in random sh*t that has nothing to do with anything just for the hell of it and screw any sort of good story?"" I will hope to see something good happen by the end of Season 2 or hope that they just cancel the show altogether instead of watch it destroy itself and go completely under.",2011
10,"As someone who gets hives when a Journey song comes on the radio, I was taken by surprise at how good Glee is. An exceptionally attractive and talented cast focuses a spotlight--both figuratively and literally--on the ultimate dweebs of high school: glee club.",2009
8,"OK...so the plot line of the new Fox TV series ""Glee"" leaves a lot to be desired. In many instances, plot points from earlier episodes are ignored entirely in later episodes (like the mandate that all songs be about God or balloons after the club put on a sexed-up routine to ""Push It"" at a pep rally) and the story seems to be based more on recurring themes than a cohesive plot line. But who cares?! The real magic of the show lies in its two strong points: the characters and the music.",2009
5,"As a fan of Season 1 Glee, I felt that Season 3 really dropped the ball. Dropped it like a hot potato. Here's my brief and humble opinion on why that happened.",2012
7,"'Glee' may not be everyone's cup of tea, but in my opinion, it's a great feel-good teen comedy. The casting is without a doubt great, and each member brings something individual to the show - Lea Michele does an especially great job in her role as Rachel. I also think that the musical numbers add another dimension to the show - they are often fun and done well, and I think they are a good way of introducing many aspects of music to the younger generation... I like the way that this show deals with a wide range of different issues, such as bullying, loss, homosexuality and the various kinds of pressure that many teens face today. I would say that the only thing that lets down the show in places is an occasionally over-cheesy script - I think that some of the more emotional scenes have been slightly tainted by over-doing it a little on the dialogue front.",2014
1,"Does anyone remember 'Cop Rock'? No? It was something along the lines of 'Glee' in that it tried to combine a few good ideas in a horrible, horrible bastard child of a TV show. 'Cop Rock' was a combo of 'Hill Street Blues' with 'Fame'. The boys in blue were singing and dancing while booking the bad guys. I think it had an impressive run of a whopping three episodes. 'Glee', like 'Cop Rock' sucks too. This show tries to combine '90210', 'Desperate Housewives', 'Fame', and a number of other marginal shows into one. It includes drama, humor, talent, and human interest in to a tight little package that fails miserably. Sure, it would be good if it were half of those things, but it is seriously too much which makes it a train wreck which is (oddly enough) impossible to watch. I actually feel sorry for the talented actors who signed on for this and hope they can recover from this debacle of as television show.",2009
7,"""Glee"" is a high school comedy (dramedy?) filled with music and choreography. It follows the students and faculty surrounding a high school glee club. The show exploits high school stereotypes (the popular jocks and cheerleaders, the ""losers"" interested in music clubs, the dumb athlete, the flamboyant homosexual, etc.), while preaching a ""be yourself"" and ""follow your dreams"" message. There are some emotions, but much of the show is light-hearted fun.",2009
1,Warning: Spoilers!,2011
1,I just watched an episode of that as a make-weight to get the girlfriend to watch Empire Strikes Back. Not worth even that. That was comfortably the worst thing I've ever seen in my life.,2011
1,"Please help me out here because I'm completely bemused and dumbfounded. How the hell has this show won 'awards'? What on earth has happened to artistic culture when such a pile of turd is watched and adored by so many people that it wins an award? Has 'cheesy, awful singing' suddenly become art nouveau? Have 'terrible wooden acting' and 'vomit-inducing story lines' become the forefront of our viewing consumption? Let's face it, this show is total rubbish! Watched by confused, hormonal teens and adults who have no clue about real music, it decimates songs without mercy and pushes intellect to the gutter. Now we have The Glee Project, which not only further insults the integrity of true musicians, but also allows the brats who love this nonsense to be embroiled into it's web of repulsive so-called entertainment. Don't be sucked into this money making vortex of cultural destruction, it will only serve to let the producers deliver even more of this abominable trash into our living rooms.",2011
1,"I've been a show choir kid my ENTIRE life and I was born and raised in OHIO where the show takes place and I have never been embarrassed about it. After watching this show, I've never felt more embarrassed in my life. Don't get me wrong, the pilot showed A LOT of promise, I even enjoyed it, but after watching episodes two and three, I wanted to gouge my eyes out with a fork. This show is NOTHING what it's like to be in an Ohio show choir. I went to Olentangy High School in Lewis Center, OH and in our show choir, we really did have cheerleaders and football players on board and EVERYBODY supported EVERYBODY. I mean, our quarterback was the lead in our senior play for Christ's sake. Maybe the writer's should visit Olentangy High School and Teays Valley High School to see what show choir life in Ohio is REALLY about!! Key-what?!!! KEYNOTES!!!!",2009
3,"After just viewing the first season of Glee I noticed the more I watched the less I liked it. It isn't so much the hopeless stereotyping but more about the emasculation of men. Kurt is a Hollywood version of the safe, marginalized gay character who's not so much gay as he is a hyper-effeminate girl wannabe. Straight boy Finn, likable dumb jock, comes home to an ambush. Mom's moved them in with Kurt and his dad and he is forced to share a bedroom with his manipulative stalker. When Finn fights back against Kurt's bordello-like redecorating of their bedroom Kurt's dad kicks him out of the house. By the end of the show Finn completely caves in, showing up at school in a dress and red-glitter eye liner to confront the football goons about to ""redecorate"" Kurt.",2011
1,"I don't understand. Is this a documentary about how to mime really badly? If the actors are really the people singing, then why do they not try to make it look more realistic? On the occasions when I have this show on TV, I have it on in the background and listen to the music. If I look at the picture, I lose interest extremely quickly. I have been told it is a very funny show, but the funniest thing is the 'performers' 'performing'. Part of the problem could be that here in Australia, we don't go in for this sort of crap. And don't throw Olivia Newton-John at me. She was born in England, and has spent most of her life overseas. Barak Obama is more Australian than she is.",2010
2,"I worry that other countries watch programs like this and think that it is indicative of American culture. The problem is, this show isn't satire. It isn't lampooning anything. They're actually representing that doing bad is ""not recycling"" and doing good is refraining from telling ridiculously dramatic and emotional people that they're idiots. The clichés in this show go beyond simple cliché to the point of being a political cartoon. Boys are are simply dogs with huge genitals with the words ""sole motivation"" tattooed on them, girls are represented by bear traps chained to a big metal ball that has ""needless drama"" chiseled into it, and homosexuals are represented by a ""Martyr"" brand bottle of maple syrup with a big ""Can do no wrong"" slogan underneath their name, and all of these things are jumping up for a brass ring that says ""Popularity"" on it. I used to teach and if a girl in my class came up and said, ""I feel the need to express myself, I would have advised her that she was absolutely free to do that after class on her own time."" And if you play football and you throw a slushy in an Asian girl's face because she's in glee club, I might not be able to get you expelled but I guarantee, you would be my bitch for the rest of the year. And if you threaten to kill a gay kid because he's gay, I might not be able to get you expelled but, again, you'd be my bitch for the rest of the year. I really like Jane Lynch and the musical numbers are entertaining at times but gosh this show is awful. I've come away from the episodes I've seen just feeling frustrated that this is a cultural phenomenon.",2010
8,"I'm not a professional reviewer, nor will I pretend to be like some people who review here. Just a regular guy who really enjoyed watching the pilot for Glee. Yes, there are a few stereotyped characters. When will Hollywood ""update"" their stereotypes? I'm pretty sure that with shows like American Idol, it's considered ""cool"" if you can sing like these kids can. So I'm hoping the writers of this show will work out some of these stereotypes and the characters will develop. Overall it was nice entertainment with some GREAT songs. Those kids can sing!! I actually re-played a couple of the songs they sang, jut because they did such a great job. And with Jane Lynch in the cast, you know the show is going to be good! Can't wait for the rest of the season to start this fall.",2009
2,"i feel like i would enjoy this show if it weren't for two, major problems. 1) the singing sounds horribly fake, every single time. 2) it uses every high school cliché in the book, and i mean ALL of them.",2011
10,I don't normally feel the need to add my 2 cents to the review pages here but Archer has motivated me to do so.,2010
10,"Having just seen the special sneak preview of 'ARCHER' on the FX network, I have to say that this was possibly the most entertaining, most ribald, most disturbing and just plain hysterical thirty minutes of television I have ever seen. Think 'Venture Brothers' meets James Bond meets a truck load of self-obsessed heroine addicts and you'll begin to get an idea of what awaits us all in January when this series comes to the masses in prime time. Fans of H. Jon Benjamin will love him as he brings his own dead pan cadence to Sterling Archer, a character that is arguably the most narcissistic is television history. The writing is quick and sharp, the animation is stylized and hip and the laughs come faster than you can catch them.",2009
10,"Archer is quite possibly the funniest show on television, rapid fire jokes about whore island, a hungry hungry hippo, and baby crazy ex girlfriends, all that plus the brilliance of stir Friday. I am a total TV alchoholic and this show is incredibly funny. Though there is a slight issue with the comedy, if you take yourself too seriously and or you can't laugh at sheer stupidity the show might not be for you. Anyways you won't know if you like the comedy or not without watching and episode yourself. So I strongly incourage everyone to sit down watch an episode or two and I bet you will be rolling on the floor due to the doucheness that is Sterling Archer. Alright Andy I know the fact that arrested development got canceled still hurts but it doesn't mean you should start bashing a different kind of comedy. Archer is incredibly funny, and yes it is basic raunchy humor, but it is the sheer ridiculousness of each situation that allows the comedy to turn in literal loll. so open your mind laugh at a Russian roulette joke and enjoy the brilliant stupidity that is Archer.",2010
10,"This show is the best thing that's happened to modern day TV. It is animated, yet hits serious topics right at the spot. It makes it look like a kid's show, but definitely with adult situations, which is great. The characters are light and well situated. The dialog is outrageously funny and naughty, containing serious amounts of irony and masked profanities. The plot of the show revolves around a secret agency (ISIS) and the relations between the people working there. The main character is the confident, arrogant and self-involved, yet not that adequate secret agent Sterling archer - a handsome hedonist man, that never cares about anyone but himself. Hilarious. 10/10",2011
10,finally a funny entertaining show! lately it seems the other short 30 min comedy shows have become lazy and stale. and with south park not starting for another month i was very happy to find this show down right hilarious from start to finish. sure its simple. but the characters are so funny and its pretty well written.,2010
10,I was a fan of the hit and miss show Sealab and later on Frisky Dingo which was less hit and miss and quite entertaining. If you like rank shows. I am also a fan of Venture Bros and I don't see how you cant draw the similarities between the two. I am also happy to see Jon Benjamin get some steady voice work and he was great in Dr Katz and Home Movies. I would recommend it to anyone to watch the first episode before making your judgment. This is the best pilot I have seen in a while and usually their pretty lame even on shows I think have promise.,2009
9,"In only 22 minutes, Archer gets away with referencing dirty sex every scene, showing off the backside of a woman with the sting of a ping pong paddle still red, and being a very funny, witty new show! It gets away with them because it is funny and also happens to be animated. The animation really works with the style of the show.",2010
9,"This show caught me off guard. I dismissed it without giving it a chance at first, but then went ahead and watched it on demand. I am sure glad that I did. Archer is an over the top raunchy fest based on the doings of a supposed spy firm. You have Sterling, an insecure guy who thinks very little, does very many, and says just enough to keep us laughing...mainly because he is so stupid. You have Malory, an unhappy boss who loves an enemy, hates being Sterling's mom at times, and has shown more than once to be off her rocker. You then have Lana(L-a-n-a), Sterling's Ex who isn't over Sterling. She is also a no nonsense, ass whipping babe. This show nails it. I highly recommend it.",2010
10,"Before watching archer I would watch cartoons like Family Guy, American Dad and Futurama. These sort of animated shows are good but old and don't change the formula of a successful show. They are all the same, a family/ group of friends getting into mischief everyday and each day is completely different but with the same people.",2014
10,"if you don't like this show, then you have no sense of humor or you take your movies and TV shows far too seriously. this is a very funny and in your face comedy. lots of laughs, stupid jokes, just impossible situations. all of this creates an out of this world event. the premise if just a ridiculous secret agency that never gets the right things done. Archer is just a high school jock that never grew up. i showed this show to a few friends who'd never heard of it and we continued to rewind just to hear the jokes because they were just too funny. these jokes take it right to the edge without ever stepping over the line. its a must see for adults who still love their teenager side.",2011
8,"I like this show, it's one of my favorites from last season and I'm looking forward to Season 2. As far as animated shows go, it's pretty much the only one I watch regularly. Family Guy is OK, I'm bored with the Simpsons, can't stand South Park, and really haven't watched that much animation since I was kid watching Space Ghost and the Herculoids. (Loved those rhinos that shot the pellets!) The guy who does the voice of Sterling is perfect. The adult-themed comedy is basic, sophomoric, but that's what makes it funny. I guess if you're not intellectually challenged as some people assert then this show may not be for you. So, don't watch it. I'd rather miss a Mensa society meeting than miss an episode of Archer. It's a lot more fun, and a lot less pretentious.",2010
5,"When Archer first aired it was my favourite TV show, it was slick and the humor just hit the spot but the writers have managed to destroy this once great show. When they changed from secret agents to drug dealers I persisted even though it was pretty poor simply because I liked the characters and it still had the odd chuckle but each season since has become less and less funny until we reach Dreamland, this is where it has become so bad I haven't been able to finish an episode yet. It's bland, unfunny and just plain boring. The show has been renewed for more seasons still and I can only fear at how bad it will become. I originally rated Archer an 8, since season 5 its slowly decreased until I can't give it any more than a terrible 1. To coin an Archer phrase 'eat a d1ck, writers!'.",2017
10,"I started my cynicism with Ren and Stimpy, Log was my Favourite, and even in single digits I understood.",2014
9,"Having only seen bits and pieces of Archer, I was very skeptical to give it shot; but having accidentally forgotten to cancel my Netflix trial account I decided to give the show a three episode trial; and I am glad that I have; I am not a guy that is easily brought to laughter, for me, visual content has to be matched with brilliant witting to give me chuckle; but this show had me literally laughing out loud.",2014
10,"ARCHER is a brilliant combination spy show and workplace sitcom, with all the quirky and messed-up characters therein. H. Jon Benjamin is perfect as Sterling Archer, but the whole cast is excellent (Amber Nash, Lucky Yates and the always-hilarious Dave Willis, in particular). You could go blind from the heightened dose of smartassery and the dialogue zings back and forth like flying bullets. It's actually kinda rare for an animated show  -ANY- show to be as consistently funny as this one. It's insanely quotable and packs obscene replay value. Seriously, it goes down like candy. And I love that they made Archer's spy car a '70 Dodge Challenger. Bonus points, right there. This show's a personal favorite.",2014
10,"One liner after one liner after one liner after one liner, this show is just super sharp. Honestly, from what I've seen it is as good as South Park in its prime, although different in style. This show looks dumb when you watch it, but it makes you laugh constantly. It's an insanely sharp script disguised by dumb characters and I bet if I watch these episodes again I'll pick up new jokes I didn't notice the first time around.",2014
10,"Sterling Malory ARCHER, Code name Duchesses the over needy, sexist, mama's boy of a man. ",2011
2,"I'm sorry, but i can't see the appeal here. I watched 3 episodes in agony, and i still haven't seen anything that a ""normal"" mind would find even remotely funny. The characters are stupid, abrasive and cruel, while Archer is an opinionated loudmouth who cares only about himself and isn't aware of what is happening around him most of the time.",2014

10,"Archer is quite possibly my new favorite show. This comes from the creator of Frisky Dingo, the show that took a similar comedic aim at superheroes. Archer has some of the best character flaws on television. Sterling Archer is the womanizing main character who despite his aloofness and major flaws is one of ISIS best agents. Lana Kane plays his mocha ex lover who loves inter-racial porn and turtleneck skirts. Carol or cheryl or crystal, whatever her name is this week, is the sex crazed secretary who like to be choked in bed. Cyril is the comptroller who is somehow sleeping with Lana while trying to impress her more than Archer. Malory is Archer's mother/leader of ISIS. Her dog duchess spawned archer's codename and her torid love affairs with other spies all over the world get in the way of ISIS being the number 1 spy organization. And Pam is the chubby outspoken HR rep who is always looking for some way to appreciated while also insulting Carol for being Carol. The characters in the show mix so well together that each episode has the ability to be rewatched numerous times. Watch Archer on FX and see for yourself",2010
10,"It is a fantastic show. I cannot stress enough how simple the humor is, but they make you think beyond just stupid. The episodes flow very naturally and I find myself saying what is coming next (Phrasing!). That said, one would assume the show is predictable and boring; it is anything but. I find it predictable at times because the humor in it is exactly like mine is.",2015
9,"Max Prodanov and barry-j-kelly don't know what funny is. Archer, in my humble opinion, is one of the funniest shows to hit TV, ever. However, this humor isn't for everyone, like Max and Barry whom both lack any sense of wit, and are probably both wrinkly old farts with a complete lack of ability to take this show in its context. Archer is the Mount Olympus of witty, vulgar, and walk-the-line comedy. If you like South Park, you will love this show (at least the 1st season, the 2nd is great but pales in comparison to the 1st). The character Archer, codenamed Duchess, is a confused adult in a child's body. His dysfunction is a pure result of his overly wealthy and scandalous mother's own problems in which she passed to her son. Lacking his own sense of security and individuality, Archer's character reflects his insecurities in combination with his good looks and physical abilities to become one of the funniest animated characters on television (Possibly 2nd only to Cartman).",2011
10,"This is definitely my new favorite show. Absolutely genius, I would say this is the best show on TV right now. Of course, the content is right up my alley. I love Venture Bros. and other quirky Adult Swim shows, and of course various other animated shows with an adult target audience, such as Family Guy, South Park, Futurama, and the like. Of course, ARCHER is not on Adult Swim, but obviously it would fit right in. Fow now it is on TNT, which is great. I like the idea that a network other than FOX is getting into the this genre. Maybe we will see more shows like this pop up in the ratings battle.",2010
8,"I have loved nearly every minute of every episode of Archer, right from the start, but season 8? No - just no. It would be tragic if this were the last season or the one by which the show as a whole was judged, but somebody has been taking the bad drugs at Archer Central. It's a bit of a travesty, let's be frank. My advice? Watch the first seven seasons and pretend the current one never happened - kind of like the plot.",2017
8,"I love Archer. I have re-watched it countless times, and have enjoyed every moment of it, with one exception. Season eight horrible. I literally made an IMDb account to let people know about this. It's such a disgrace to an amazing show. I would give this a perfect ten, but I have to take away something for season 8. Watch all of it but season 8. Stay away.",2017
9,"Often times an actor or actress gets associated with an iconic role, a role they basically continue to play over and over, no matter what show or movie they're in. Happily, this is not the case for Patricia Heaton in her new show ""The Middle"". Her new character, while still a wife and mother of three, is much different than Debra Barone, the character she played for 9 years in ""Everybody Loves Raymond."" ",2009
10,"I really wish ABC would promote this show more, and give the actors credit for their work. They have been robbed of Emmy nominations twice. I honestly enjoy Modern Family but I don't get why that show gets a million Emmy nods every year. Anyway, I've been watching since day 1 and have loved it since. Frankie Heck is the harried car-saleslady mother of 3 kids, living in the fictional town of Orson, Indiana. She is always trying to get the kids to bond, while trying to get by herself, as she and her husband Mike don't make a lot of money and their house is always a mess. Axl, the oldest, is a typical lazy, sarcastic teenager who is almost always making fun of his sister Sue, the middle teen daughter. She is very optimistic and bubbly, but nobody really knows she exists, and can never make anything out of herself, especially at school. Finally we have little Brick, who's nose is always stuck in a book and doesn't really have any friends, but if he does make a friend, they're even quirkier than he is. And they are always trying to compete with their practically perfect neighbors, the Donahues. I think we can all relate to this show in some way--the house is always a mess, the mom doesn't always feel like cooking so she brings home fast food, there's those neighbors who are like the perfect family that you've always wanted to be, and the kids don't always get along. It's not laugh out loud funny but I still tune in every Wednesday. And it is NOT a ripoff of Malcolm. That show was about 4 brothers, one of them being a genius. And they lived in California whereas the Hecks live in the MID-west. And they're middle-income, and this show is focused on the mom, trying to do her best to support her family. This show also has more positive vibes. If it didn't have the word ""Middle"" in the title, people probably wouldn't say a word, right? 8/10.",2012
10,"I had no particular hopes for this show. Of all the sitcoms on ABC's new ""Wednesday Comedy Night"" this is the one I expected to like the least, so it came as quite a surprise how funny and entertaining the pilot episode was. It moves along nicely and the cast is excellent. I always thought Heaton was talented but could never really enjoy her on EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND because her character was, quite frankly, an unendurable bitch. Here she has a chance to project a little more warmth and likability and really shines. The real charmer in the cast is Eden Sher as the teenage daughter, a marvel of gawky authenticity. I fear THE MIDDLE may be just a shade too subtle for audiences who tastes run to fart joke and similar crudity, but more discriminating viewers should definitely check it out.",2009
8,"I'm guessing the family portrayed in 'The Middle' is not the norm but they certainly are closer to 'real' people than most sitcom characters or, for that matter, most 'reality' show contestants. The children are not perfect nor are they drug addicted or sex-crazed or alcoholic or parent-hating brats. The oldest son hanging out in boxer shorts? My son did that. The middle child, the daughter, trying to find her place in the school social order but often coming up short? Who hasn't failed at something in life? And the youngest child, the little boy who often repeats things in a whisper, is sweet and loves his parents. These kids make you laugh both from their unintentional humor and from recognition. And I especially like the fact that each episode ends on an upbeat note. The family members, no matter what crazy circumstances they may find themselves in, love each other and accept their lot in life without bitterness and anger. Far removed from the pop culture norms we've been fed lately, people living in 'The Middle' may actually exist after all.",2009
9,"You'd want to see this show because of the household names, Patricia Heaton, Neil Flynn, Chris Kattan, Brian Doyle Murray, and you'd be pleasantly surprised by the writing. We all ""know"" the harried mom, laid back dad, ""under achiever"" kids, but within a twenty minute episode I realize how really well the writers capture the frustration and absurdity that goes with life in ""the middle"". This program doesn't fit the ""oh poor hapless daddy"" sitcoms, the kind Bob Newhart would NEVER do, and that's why I've been watching it. Because they have a real mess of a home and wear clothes you do see in the newspaper insert ads, these are some real people dealing with some way out there kinds of characters in situations which are hilarious and sometimes heartwarming, without being mushy. This is one show I look forward to each week!!",2009
9,"There's a number of shows that I record every week and this is one of them. Whenever I go to catch up on watching shows that were recorded, there are some that are starting to feel like a chore to watch, but I always looks forward to watching this one.",2009
10,"Thank you, ABC, for putting a great group of comedy writers together to support this all star cast. Barbara Heaton as the used car saleslady mom and the janitor from Scrubs as the dad are the best parents I've seen on t.v. in a long time. The 3 children are given meaty characterizations to play and I hope they will win many awards. The kids and the other supporting cast (including Chris Kattan and the car lot boss) couldn't have been cast better. Every show gives me old fashioned belly laughs and inspiration that, like this family struggling to survive in the middle class (the reason for its name, not named for the middle of the country in which it takes place) we can all learn a lesson in what makes families strong.",2010
10,"Even though I'm 13, I love The Middle, even though I don't think I'm apart of the target audience. It makes me laugh very much and it's the same story with my younger sisters. We have many episodes recorded at home! The plot lines are very real and very funny and amusing. The characters are also very realistic. I also love how it isn't always comedy and that there's a little bit of other genres too, but still it's mostly comedy. I love watching The Middle as its, entertaining, hilarious, fun and gets me in a happy mood. Sometimes I can also relate to the story plots such as the house looking a complete mess and wanting all the new trends! I also like how Patricia Heaton, who plays Frankie Heck, narrates during parts of the show. It's something different and I like it! They are the many reasons why I love to watch The Middle! Overall I cannot put anything else in the review except for I love it!",2012
10,"I am so pleased that there is finally a good family show on the air that doesn't promote social/political stances and shove their viewpoint in everyone's face! Patricia Heaton is back and with a vengeance! I have been a fan of Ms. Heaton's every since her days on Thirty Something and Everybody Loves Raymond. Her comedic timing is dead on and her facial expressions suit the moment perfectly; not to mention that her acting skills are per near flawless. When you watch this show, you can really feel what the family is going through and that is, at least in part, due to Patricia Heaton's performance.",2013
10,"This show is so awesome and totally rocks. This isn't you're over-hyped new sitcom, this blows all of those type of shows out of the water. Their is no lame actors like David Spade or Seth Green on this show, those guys just bounce around from one bad sitcom to the next without any actual skill while doing so.",2012
10,"I have seen a lot of the popular shows out there. i mean A LOT. and i have come to the conclusion that ABC sucks at advertising. THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST SHOWS. one of the most underrated TV shows. it grows on you. 11 on 10. the characters are amazing. everybody is amazing. cant find a flaw in a single character's portrayal. special mention to 'Atticus', the kid who plays 'brick'. he is a genius in the making. the writing is clever. and i guarantee in the 20 minutes you will be spending you will fall off your chair at least once. i just want this show to get its due success. and for the people who are complaining the interval between shows is long - start showing your support, you won;t have to complain. and lastly i'm disappointed with the 7.8 rating. guys is it at least a 9.4.",2011
7,"The best thing about this new series is that it doesn't take itself at all seriously. There are no hidden agendas and there's very little sentimentality; which is quite refreshing to see in an American sit-com as all too often the viewer is comforted with the nicer side of life! Patricia Heaton (Frankie Heck) may be reprising the role of an unappreciated wife, but this time she's different, she's let off the leash and has real bite. She also narrates the show which is a kinda cool. Frankie's husband is Mike Heck (Neil Flynn) a Quarry Manager that's a little too laid-back for Frankie liking, but the pair gel very well and they do seem to still love each other after having three kids. The eldest is Axl, a typical teenager who wants to be a rock star or playboy to the stars. Of course he's completely deluded and isn't exactly a grade-A student, but what he does have going for him is his sporting prowess. He appears to be in all the sports teams. He's also very loyal to his family, but it's very subtle; you have to watch to see what I mean. Sue Heck is the nearest thing to Meg Griffin in real TV. Continually in a state neurotic insecurity and anonymity; Sue repeatedly fails to make any impact regarding after school activities – she literally tries-out for everything! Yet, she struggles on with incredible tenacity, a quality that's quite inspiring to see. Unlike Meg, Sue is pretty, slim and glasses free; but at 14, she still wears braces. Everyone (including her tutors) can never seem to remember her name or face, this only exacerbates her self-consciousness and anxiety. Look out for how delighted she is to make the school cross-country team (albeit contrived). The final component of the Heck family is Brick, a 9 year old loner with a reading fixation. Brick doesn't suffer fools lightly, he's very selective about to whom he speaks and he comes across as an evil genius in the making. Brick is very forgetful and shows little interest in anything other than his books. Nevertheless he's an interesting character and not cutesy which is always good! For me though Sue (Eden Sher) is the real gem in this new sit-com; she's very amusing, stupid and naive, yet her never say die attitude is heart-warming and a delight to see. I hope The Middle goes for a few more seasons, just to see how Sue gets on!",2011
10,"The only reason I tuned into this show was for Neil Flynn. I was a huge fan of his character as Janitor on Scrubs. I had little hopes because I was not a huge Patricia Heaton fan. I have found now that was not her fault, but the fault of the writers of Everybody Loves Raymond. They made her such a hard to like character that you could not help but dislike her. I mean who would have stayed married to her? Anyway, I digress, The Middle is rather charming. I find myself constantly rolling my eyes (in a good way) at Axl, cheering for Sue and trying to guess what Brick will do next. The Middle is a great example of the average American family trying to stay afloat in today's economy. They portray the way most of us in my age demographic grew up in the Midwest. I am astounded as someone who spent Jr. High and High School in Iowa at just how accurate they are. I will be around watching for as long as they keep the show on the air.",2010
1,"This TV show seems to be dead set on taking the previous crown that Malcolm in the middle had rightly earnt. The problem with this show is the characters are very weak and in no way have any of the charisma the characters from Malcome in the middle commanded.If anything this show makes you miss the original Malcolm in the Middle show more. Yes you will smile yes very occasionally you will laugh but the show just doesn't seem to hit the spot and my wife pretty much hit the nail on the head when she walked in the room and said ""is it trying to be Malcolm in the middle ? because if it is it isn't doing a good job"" Its not often i will sit down and comment/review a TV show but i feel so let down by this show i just had to voice my opinion on it.

1,"First of all, this show is so exaggerated, bad acting, and lack of originality. I really tried to like this show, watching enough episodes, but i see this so exaggerated. Also, this show is a bad copy of a very funny show ""Malcolm in the Middle"". Malcolm is far more funny and original. This show is a copy for many reasons. First, the name. Other is that the main character relate the episode. Another thing is the characters. Brick looks like Dewey. Mike is also similar as Hal.The setting is the same as in Malcolm. Also the families are in the same social class and have the same economic problems. In this show, the characters are weak and boring. Also the character of Sue is so exaggerated and foolish.

They are the parents of three children, Axl (Charlie McDermott), Sue (Eden Sher), and Brick (Atticus Shaffer).[3] The series is narrated by Frankie, initially an under-performing salesperson at a used-car dealership and later a dental assistant. Her stoic husband Mike manages a local quarry and serves as a stabilizing influence in the family. The children are quite different from one another: oldest son Axl, a popular but under-motivated and cynical teenager, does well in sports but not in academics; daughter Sue is an enthusiastic young teen but chronically unsuccessful and socially awkward; and youngest son Brick, an intelligent but introverted compulsive reader with quirky behavioral traits.",2015
1,"This show is horribly boring, I've attempted to watch it on several occasions each time worse than the previous. The show, while well cast, is poorly written in that it fails to do the sole thing the show is made for- to produce laughs. It tries too hard to be funny and it's just not, in fact, it's hard to tell when you're supposed to laugh because there's just nothing in the show that is clever or funny. The episodes are short yet they seem to drag on as the characters just sort of f**k around. The characters are fairly annoying and dumb which should make for an interesting show, it works in ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"" So shouldn't it work for this show? Well no, it doesn't, at all, sense is a word that seems to have escaped their vocabulary. Some shows can be clever and dumb at the same time and they are hilarious, this is not one of those shows. For better quality viewing, watch the show previously mentioned or the brilliantly written original comedy ""Louie"".",2015
10,"I'm sorry I have to disagree with previous reviewers who do not like this show. I was an absolute devotee of Everybody Loves Raymond and Patricia Heaton deserved her awards in those days, but this to me is a far better show because the message in the end is usually positive and family-affirming. Yes I was at first put off by the crazy kids too but watch for a while and you'll see they have incredible talent, as does the whole family. Every cast member is a real character, but Frankie Heck steals the show every time. It really is a matter of taste and I hope the producers realise this appeals a LOT to middle class families. All the situations the Hecks get into are SO real, and Patricia Heaton is absolutely at her best, completely believable and hilarious.Brilliant, brilliant brilliant.Love it to bits.

Because they're deep characters, they're not gonna slam you over the head with comedy. This ain't My Name Is Earl, people. The show's funny, but in a real, get to know everyone kind of way.",2010
10,"I was lukewarm on this show throughout the first season and for the beginning of the second, but the last few episodes have made this the funniest show on air for me. The humor is not always laugh out loud, but I can watch each episode a few times and find new things that make me laugh each time. ",2009
10,"This show is basically a cute version of The Office. If you haven't seen The Office, it is a hilarious show that is filmed like a documentary. It has a weird vibe because all of the characters seem to know that the cameras are there. They also give asides to the camera which are always funny. The asides in Parks and Recreation are funnier than those from The Office. They seem to be more of a showcase for the actors to show off their comedy, not additions to the plot. ",2010
10,"There is no doubt that one of the main inspirations of this show was The Office - you will realise this in the first minute of the first episode. However, instead of trying to copy the main points of that show's success, Parks and Recreation has come up with its very own recipe. Amy Poehler is amazing as the lead actress, she plays an extremely enthusiastic city official in a department filled with bludgers and lazy bums.",2010
9,"I'm surprised at how many people wrote negative reviews of this show despite it being my most-looked forward comedy of the week, followed by the Office, Curb, Sunny in Phily, and the Peep Show - a great British comedy. ",2009
10,"There was a lot of anticipation for Amy Poehler's new series, at least around here there was, and after eagerly tuning in to the pilot episode and every episode since then, I can honestly say that it has lived up to my expectations! ",2009
10,"There are always a few television shows that seem to ""define"" a genre every decade or so, and considering Parks and Recreation finished its final run several months ago, I feel it important to revisit the show and the impact it left. Many times it was spurned as ""The Office Rip-Off"" in its starting days, despite it being more of a brainchild of the writers than anything. It seems safe to say, that after more than seven years on the air, Parks and Recreation has carved its own spot amongst the quirky and well-loved comedies that are hard to come across today.",2015
10,"I've been a big fan of Amy Poehler ever since she played Andy Richter's pigtailed, dental-retainered little sister (with the huge crush on Conan!) on Conan O'Brien's late night show. That first appearance is still the most amazing performance I've ever seen on TV. The addled but adorable Leslie Knope is the absolutely IDEAL character for Amy to play! I'm also thrilled to see Rashida Jones, another of my favorite super-talents, doing a thoroughly delicious characterization as Ann Perkins. Word was that the network was worried about the similarity to The Office. What's to worry? Two genius shows just might be better than one!!! The writing on this show is breathtakingly original and deeply enjoyable. You won't find a better cast anywhere on Earth. This is just another case of ""a perfect storm"" of comedy excellence on NBC -- along with The Office and 30 Rock. It's well known that the best TV comedy derives from complex, fascinating characters. Along with the creators and scribes of those other two shows, these writers are the absolute best at devising characters that are equally lovable and horrifying -- you can totally revel in their triumphs AND their tragedies!",2009
10,"I never saw the first few episodes which I intend to get to at some point. Got into Parks and Recreation somewhere in the middle of the first season. It has quickly become one of my favorite shows on television. Up there next to Family Guy. I never really got into Amy Poehler's humor on SNL, but Parks and Recreation showed me just how talented she really is. She is an incredible comedic actress, her timing and expression are dead on and she is sooo cute! I'm glad her talent is showcased so well on Parks and Recreation. The other actors on the show aren't too shabby either. Very talented people on this show, Nick Offerman, Paul Schneider, Aubrey Plaza, and Chris Pratt are my other favorites. And yes, it is ""laugh out loud"" kind of funny. It is smart humor too. Great characters, great stories. I can't wait to see how it develops.",2010
9,Parks and Recreation is a rare gem in the comedy business. There is never a dull moment.,2017
4,"First off, I watched every episode of every season. This is not some hit piece, but a thought-out explanation of what was rubbing me wrong this whole time... rubbed raw by the end of it.",2015
8,"So far, since there's only been three episodes of the show, it's been pretty great. The third episode has definitely been the funniest so far, i feel like it's going to gain momentum and really prove to be just as funny as it's cousin ""The Office."" P&R has gotten generally positive reviews, and as for the negatives i say let the show grow. it's only been THREE episodes, ""The Office"" was NOT an instant classic if you all recall, it was on the chopping block a few times (and also had to try and crawl out of the massive shadow of it's brilliant British original). Amy Poehler is one of the funniest comedians right now and deserves her own time to really shine. Aziz, from the hysterical one-season sketch show Human Giant, is definitely a scene stealer, as well as Poheler's scowling, anti-government boss. It's got all the right ingredients to become another comedy gem. Give it a chance, relax, and let the best Thursday night (8:30-10) line-up on NBC pump you full of awe-smacking awesome. oh, and lighten up ;)",2009
5,"For starters, I've had big expectations of this show but in the end I was disappointed. First season reminded me of Modern Family (because of the shooting style, camera zooming in and out)and Leslie kind of resembled Phil Dunphy from M. Family. The second season was hilarious, especially the first couple of episodes but basically I've had a lot of laughs during 2nd season.",2014
6,"I browsed through the reviews, probably seeking a reinforcement of my opinion that the show has lost its previous charm. Most of the reviews are pretty old, so I still don't know if it's just me.",2012
10,I really loved this series. The thing is that I tried to start watching it a couple years ago and I hated it.. I watched like 2 episodes. Out of the blue I decided to give a second chance I finished all seasons in 2 weeks. ,2017
5,"The whole show is about nothing, not in a Seinfeld way, and when it's not it either doesn't do anything with it or tries to over use the plot setup making it seem amateur and sloppily written, in other words, boring. I have yet to see a witty twist, or an episode the whole plot isn't revealed within 2 minutes. Even while watching it gives me zero interest in the characters and this is why....",2013
8,"I have been a Saturday Night Live fan for too long. I like Amy Poehler as Leslie Knope, an idealistic parks and recreational director, for Pawnee, Indiana. The show is based about the parks and recreation department in a small Midwestern town. Amy Poehler should be on the list for Emmy nominees for Best Actress in a Comedy Series. She shines as Leslie Knope. I only wished that Lorne Michaels would start developing sitcoms with his Saturday Night Live alumni like Poehler and Tina Fey. It's worth the investment and we need to laugh in times like this more than ever. The show has a quirky, offbeat sense of humor and a supporting cast that doesn't seem familiar yet but I'm sure I'll recognize them in time. Anyway, guest stars like Megan Mullally is worth watching.",2009
10,"I started Parks and Rec from a recommendation since I love the Office. I was hesitant at first because it seemed like it was almost a rip off with the whole fake-documentary style comedy where characters break the fourth wall and speak to the camera (and thus, the audience), and it does take place in a different kind of office: the Parks and Recreation department for a town called Pawnee, Indiana. ",2017
10,Parks and Recreation is a funny show that started out slow but tuned into a hit sitcom that was extremely addicting to watch. I know myself because I binge watched the series. Amy Pohler did a terrific job starring and producing in the show as well as making people laugh. Nick Offerman personally my favorite character on the show had over 50 different quotes that made me laugh. Christ Pratt and Aubrey Plaza made a hilarious and terrific couple on the show which also took them to further stardom for the actors. Rashida Jones Leslie's beast friend in the shows had the perfect reactions. Aziz Ansari another one of my favorite characters on the show had a fun amount of swagger and was enjoyable to watch him. Rob Lowe also did a perfect job at being a crazy healthy boss to the characters as well as being Bens friend. And for Jerry he was obviously always being made fun of and hilarious to watch. Parks and recreations final episode was a touching tribute to the shows previous episodes and personally my favorite episode. All in all Parks and Recreation is a hilarious and touching show with a great cast and shall be treasured for years to come.,2015
10,Parks and Recreation is am extremely funny and emotional journey through 7 seasons.,2015
5,"I really wanted to like this show, but after watching the first 3 episodes (and one episode with the wife who didn't care for it), it's safe to say that this show is not ""The Office"". It really seems like it's trying to be similar to it, but it's just not funny. It's not Amy Poehler's fault. The scripts are just poorly written. It doesn't help that her surrounding cast aren't the greatest comedians in the business either. Besides Aziz Ansari (Tom) character, most of the other members just aren't that funny. Where as ""The Office"" scripts are written well for each character/actor on that show, what's written for the casts of P&R seems like force entertainment. You can see Amy is struggling as she deliver her lines and then thinking to herself, (this doesn't sound all that funny). Watch the show and the expressions on her face and you'll see what I mean. It's like they need to fire their writers and hire Tina Fey. Not sure what Rashida Jones was thinking. She should have stayed on ""The Office"". She does make cameo appearance from time to time on that show, but I honestly don't expect P&R to be around much longer unless they get new writers. The Pilot wasn't bad, but it seems like it's going downhill every episode. The last episode with Leslie on a date she wasn't aware of was terrible. Ann getting angry about Andy cast being on longer then it needed to be, did make the episode any more enjoyable. I haven't see anymore episodes on T.V. Either the show has already been canceled or it's on hiatus for the summer. I'll give it another shot if it returns, but if it still isn't great, I'll unschedule it from my DVR.",2009
5,"A shameless regurgitation of almost all of the comedic mechanics executed in The Office....so much so that I simply couldn't look beyond it. This alone cast a pallor upon the show...it felt contaminated....not from a principled perspective...but from more of a ""been there, done that"" perspective which made the humor seem flaccid...without flavor.",2011
10,"I am a big Amy Poehler and Tina Fey fan. I absolutely love '30 Rock' and when I heard that Amy Poehler was also going to be starring in her own show, I was psyched.",2009
10,"While Parks and Recreation may not have the awards and ratings of its predecessors, it still manages to provide absolutely hysterical comedy that just brings out that good feeling. Parks and Rec's greatest strength has to be its superb cast. Unlike The Office, most supporting cast members are developed enough to become the main subject for any given episode. The supporting cast, at times, even triumphs over the main cast. While the main cast of Parks and Rec might be smaller, these characters still Pack-A-Punch. Amy Poehler and Nick Offerman's great deliveries provide a countless number of quotable, classic lines. The stories of each Parks and Rec episode tend focus on very interesting plots that help keep the show fresh and consistently funny. Overall Parks and Recreation is by far the BEST television show I have watched in history, and I look forward to the show ending with a bang in its 7th and final season!!!",2015
7,"As opposed to other reviewers who are sadly so limited they can only conceive of Linda Hunt as an object of derision, I tune in specifically to see her. The show is adequate. I've always liked LL Cool J and it's nice to see Chris O'Donnell again. (The nerds suck, especially when you consider Abby from the original show.) But it's the presence of Linda Hunt that elevates this show. She's a rich, interesting actor and her character here has a great backstory.",2010
9,"I watched the crossover (call it the NCIS:LA premiere) last season between the two NCIS casts and really enjoyed it. Chris O'Donnell has grown up and yet, there is still that juvenile offender on the loose quality to him. Teaming him up with LL Cool J was a stroke of genius. They play off of each other so well. Pulling in Oscar winner Linda Hunt to play Hetty was a masterstroke. This show is well cast and the writing is solid. I have to disagree with other reviewers about Adam Jamal Craig and Daniela Ruah. I think they put in very solid performances as supporting team members. And Barrett Foa is perfect as the somewhat geeky technical assistance. All in all, a fun show to watch. I look forward to it marking as many seasons as it's forerunner, NCIS.",2009
8,Without her we wouldn't care for Callen or Hanna as it's her feelings about them that motivate us. It's her support of Deeks that reluctantly made us wait and see with him. It's her knowledge of Callen and her willingness to go after his enemies that carried us through procedural plot. Anyone sent to take her place is seen as our enemy and we long to see them eliminated. We wait for the little sounds bits from this diminutive character squirreling them away like precious nuts. Actually the two information analysts add to Hetty's character in a remarkable way. I was a little shocked when they added Nell as I thought Eric did a fine job without her but Hetty really made the addition work.,2012
10,"This show has recently overtook the original NCIS as being my favourite show. NCIS:LA may be wacky, ridiculous, and completely the opposite of how a federal agency would operate, but we get to see Chris O'Donnell and LL Cool J run round shooting people. It is unbelievably entertaining and fun to watch. However, there is more than just the casual element. Each season has a good back story. There's also the occasional twist. NCIS is slowly getting boring, or rather rapidly I should say. However, NCIS:LA is getting better and better with each season. I'm looking forward to Season 6! ",2014
8,"It took a while to get me interested in this series. Having been a long-time NCIS fan, I felt obligated to give it a fair shake. After the first few episodes, I felt bored and wondering if I should keep watching. Maybe it was because I was preoccupied when NCIS: LA would air. However, after settling down and focusing on the episodes, mainly the one where Dom gets kidnapped, I felt like they've hit their stride. There's no doubt this is a completely different show than the original NCIS. That's what makes it tolerable. They're not trying to copycat the other like the CSIs did in my opinion. They've got humor. They've got crimes they're trying to solve. They've slowly gotten some chemistry. Keep in mind, Shane Brennan is running both shows and he has yet to disappoint me on the original. They're in good hands and hopefully, they'll get even better. The first NCIS had a few bumps in the road during the first season and hit their stride in Season 2.",2010
9,"While this show isn't exactly like the original NCIS, I still absolutely love it. There is still that dynamic of banter. Instead of Tony/Kate(or Ziva)/ McGee, it's now Sam/Callen. While I do think this might have been better set in San Diego, I still like the premise.",2010
10,This is the very hyped spin-off to NCIS. It was good. More hits than misses. LL Cool J and Chris O'Donnell play their parts like veterans.,2009
1,"I have to agree with people who question what this show has to do with the ""Navy"" part of NCIS (for that matter, what does this show have to do with the ""Investigation"" part). There has been a lot of running around, car chases, explosion and shoot outs in the first few episodes, but very little good writing or interesting characters. Instead of promising an ""NCIS"" spin-off, they should have called it a modern version of ""The MOD Squad"" because that is what comes to my mind.",2009
5,"Where's the Navy part of NCIS Los Angeles? Why didn't they set the series in San Diego where there's still a Navy presence on the west coast? I truly think that the original NCIS is one of the best series' on TV, and I have been following it from the beginning well before the rest if the public 'discovered' it. While Chris O'Donnel and LL Cool J are competent actors and Linda Hunt is always worth watching, the show has no team concept. A nice addition is Peter Cambor as a profiler. I just don't really see the kind of cases involving Navy or Marine issues, maybe because there really isn't a Naval base near Los Angeles and setting it there to attract an audience is silly since the original series is set on the east coast, though filmed in Santa Clarita, and is doing alright. I'll keep watching and hope for the best, but I hope O'Donnel's character is less out of control and more steady as an agent should be, I mean he's not a teenager, though he acts like one.",2009
1,"I'm glad to see the other comments here – because according to all the magazines and websites, NCIS: LA is supposedly the hottest show this season. After having seen three episodes, I think the only reason I would continue to watch it is to ridicule the poor acting and horrible writing – a la, Mystery Science Theater.",2009
4,"I am a huge NCIS fan, but when I heard that a spin-off was in the works I was very hesitant. Spin-offs are not always a good idea and I didn't think one was necessary in a show like NCIS. Still, I was determined to the give the show a chance.",2009
7,"NCIS:Los Angeles was something I wasn't expecting to like. At first, it was rather rocky, with some sluggishly paced and unoriginal stories, clichés in the writing and characters that didn't come into their shell for a bit. Over time though, while it is not as good as the original series NCIS:Naval Crimimal Investigative Service, it has gotten better.",2011
10,"Very entertaining, topical, fast action program. terrific cast, no weak players, and lots of interesting personal dynamics between the team, also plenty of comedy moments, smart slick writing, highly entertaining. the stories are typically self contained with just some elements of references back to previous episodes, but these are usually explained so it can be enjoyed even if you missed the earlier episode. The violence is not too graphic and the emphasis is on being smarter than the bad guy, rather than being more brutal. the stories are topical, and reflect the many terrorist threats which now exist. The story is also fast paced and there is an emphasis on technology which is interesting.",2015
1,"I sometimes ""test"" TV-show concepts for fun and this has got to be one of the stupidest shows ever.",2011
3,"I just watched 10/13/09's NCIS and NCIS:LA back to back. These two shows weren't separated at birth, they were born in entirely different dimensions.",2009
10,"There's something special about the Hetty character - she is the center of the show in a unique way. The other characters look to her, respect her, protect her...for such a tiny woman, she packs a mighty punch...strength and wisdom and courage...the show needs her. She brings the team together, she brings cohesiveness and, despite her professionalism, she brings warmth. She hasn't been in the show for a bit and I know that I, and many others I've spoken to, just don't find the show as compelling without Hetty. The other characters are strong and well played, also essential but they are a team because Hetty centers them. We know this is only fiction but it's great fiction. I hope they bring Hetty back full time - she has everyone's back and they have hers...and each other's.",2011
2,"NCIS: Los Angeles is like the little brother to NCIS. It doesn't seem as serious, in fact the characters act like children compared to the cast of NCIS. Not only that but they come off cartoon-ish, the ""Ducky"" replacement character on this show reminds me of the short old women from Disney movies, big round glasses included. I had high hopes when they did the cross-over episodes with NCIS, but so far none of their episodes are even navy related. This is also another example of why LL Cool J shouldn't act, he's always tripping over his lines. Overall, I find it hard to sit through an entire episode. Maybe with a different cast, and different writers, and definitely different background music it'd be watchable. Still not as good as the original though.",2009
1,"This was not a great series when it started, and it has deteriorated to the point where it is appropriate only for not-to-bright preteens. The idea that a show ostensibly based on a law enforcement agency might actually have an attorney vet the script is apparently beyond the ken of the producer/director/writers. With the notable exception of DEA folks, most law enforcement agencies do not allow their personnel to run around on duty looking like they are dressed for putting out the garbage, permit a liaison officer to look like he is a wino who just crawled out of an alley, and they definitely do not provide them with uber-expensive cars. It is also apparent that theory of jurisdiction is also totally foreign to the writers. In the most recent episode, there was no connection whatsoever between victims or perpetrators and the US Navy, but none the less NCIS is on the case. As a former member of the Judge Advocate General's Corps, I can assure you that no military agency would have been involved in any way in the shooting of a federal agency staff officer --not only would not be involved, they would avoid a case like that like the plague. The protagonists almost never identify themselves as federal agents, nor do they produce identification. The plots are shot full of holes, and the military tie-in an insult to the Navy, the NCIS, and usually the entire Department of Defense.",2010
9,"Well, I just finished watching ""Identity"" of NCIS: LA and I have to say I was rather impressed. The writing is solid, the actors (notably Chris O'Donnell, LL Cool J and Peter Cambor) are brilliant and the setting is a good fit and change from Washington from the original series, NCIS.",2009
3,"Sorry, NCIS Los Angeles is way more Charlie's Angels than NCIS. No offense to the actors, but what went through producers' minds with NCIS LA - ""here, let's dress you up so you can go undercover?"" What?? I like NCIS the original and all the various characters, but I have no idea what the scriptwriters are up to with this show. Clearly the idea in this show is nothing more than ""I have an assignment for you, Angels."" ",2009
1,"I feel like I'm in an episode of the Twilight Zone when I see that this show is a success. Could hardly sit through two entire episodes, perhaps the worst hour long drama to ever find it's way on television. Using the NCIS name (a pretty weak show in its own right) this schlock somehow managed to become a hit. Chris O'Donnell, Linda Hunt, and LL Cool J? Honestly? This, my friends, is the nadir of our society. IMDb says I need a few more lines, so let's talk about the episode where O'Donnell's character has his cover blown, so he buys a plain black baseball cap to do what he does best (according to Mr. Cool J) and become a ""ghost."" He then proceeds to pretend being a criminal and murders a few goons, then wrestles with some demons in an attempt to find out his true identity, throws protocol out the window, yada yada yada, good guys win and get the ever important nano disk, micro chip, flash drive, whatever they were looking for. This is heavy stuff, folks. Do yourself a favor, watch any one of the far more worthy shows out there - Real Housewives of NJ, Jersey Shore, Cake Boss, Flavor of Love 4, Bret Michaels: Rock of Love Van, Stargate: Miami, Saved by the Bell: The New Class, My So Called Life, Boy Meets World, Duckman, America's Funniest Home Videos, the O'Reilly Factor, etc. You're welcome.",2010
1,"I've been watching Season 1 of this show on the DVD set and cannot believe such baloney is supposed to be a spin off of the fine NCIS series. Aside from the simpleton story lines and asinine humor, there is no semblance of reality represented by the characterizations, dialog or an association with the Navy. What's more, I could save this L.A. office a lot of money because I could tell them whodunit within the first 10 minutes of a new case. ",2011
7,The Los Angeles office of NCIS (at least in the show) is called the Office of Special Projects (OSP). That's why their cases frequently involve going undercover. They still investigate naval crimes but they are sometimes more sensitive ones. I love NCIS and will always prefer it to NCIS: LA. But at the same time I'm glad that it's not NCIS 2.0 like the CSI spin-offs are.,2010
3,"Does anyone else besides myself and my sister, feel like the writers are running this show into the ground... All the other characters have grown, you see development, while with Elena, with the exception of the bridge scene with her and Matt, is still the same selfish little girl. So much for them dropping flowers off Wickery Bridge, saying, ""here lies Elena Gilbert.."" Come on writers we need to see some character development for Elena. Also, will you please choose between Damon and Stefan, or ya know what introduce a new human love interest for her. As much as I love the thought of her and Damon at this point I could really care less if the Salvatore's go on a long vacation, mainly Stefan. Frankly hes gotten a little old. He and Elena are just a lost cause, they need separation and what happened with the road trip with Katherine, I mean really pick a plot and stick with it. I like the change of events sometimes but not when you have had so many that you as the writer have no clue where you were originally going with it in the first place. I feel like you keep changing things for the fans and that's what is getting you so lost in your writing, pick a plot go with it, let us bicker and complain, but don't change everything just because we get a little ticked off, be the writer, because I know that if we keep watching it with the way you have written it without Fan influence we will more than likely Love where ever it leads the show. Now if you are one of the writers, and you have just read this, please exit this page and never look at IMDb again, and go with what your gut tells you. Be the writer. Sincerely, Thank you, T.V.D. Fan, From Griffin, Ga.",2012
5,"I enjoyed the series for while but then it just got boring and repetitive, in every episode there's a tragic ""accident"" where someone has to risk their life to save them. Usually Stefan or useless Elena. The same thing happens every episode. Elena and Damon flirt, there's a disaster going on elsewhere, she goes back to Stefan and someone is either dying or is already dead. There's too much going on in this series, too many characters, too many supernatural things going on, it just gets confusing. Also Elena is the most annoying character ever, she needs to just make up her mind and choose, one minute its Stefan, the next its Damon, then it's Stefan, oh then its Damon again. It just makes the series repetitive and loses the storyline.Elena not being able to choose is just stupid and selfish it makes the series tacky and predictable and just pisses me off. The story is based on her and I think that's why i've come to hate this series,also because they never seem to actually kill the bad guy. They should focus on trying to keep the population of mystic falls alive because seriously how many random people are they going to kill?! This series had a lot of potential but let itself down in my opinion. Much prefer Teen Wolf!",2014
10,"When I tuned in to ""The Vampire Diaries"" for the pilot episode, I expected to watch perhaps six episodes, grow bored, and then drop the show entirely. After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, ""Supernatural."" I'd seen (and read) the ""Twilight"" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original ""The Vampire Diaries"" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.",2010
10,"After watching episode 4 i got all excited and started to flap my hands wishing the next episode will come out already. I admit first two episodes were bit slow and sluggish , but by episode 4 the story really starts to kick in. After watching it i have the greatest urges to go library and read the rest of series.",2009
2,"My score for the seasons 1 to 4 would be something like 6-7 not more not less... And that's because of the originals and the ""almost good"" love triangle (in the begging,not farther) But, oh boy...! I am so fed up with Elena's face in every scene... Elena keeps going forth and back. The situation with the dopplegangers it's really sad. We keep watching same faces and story over and over again.And the most of the times for no bloody reason. The love story became something more than boring. This show has no action,no passion,not even STORY! It's just like I am watching a love story of a 13 year old girl who don't know what to decide between 2 boys of her classroom. Totally no horror nor drama nor ""fantasy"". I am dropping it, I had enough of this bad written series",2014
1,The worst pile of drivel I've ever watched. ,2014

It was cheesy messed up series with messed up plot and characters! what happened after that? somewhere near episode 3-4 it started to come to what can be described as a normal , watchable series it had it's good points and bad points like ant other show has! it continued for I don't know episode 12-13 and then it started with every single episode, making enormous steps, great improvements!!! it started to rock a little with every episode! and last 4-5 episodes where just great , like 10/10 they improved so much they had nothing to do with those cheesy episodes! and I really started to like and love this series! and first season finale , it was something incredible unpredictability, awesomeness, great action , humor, interesting characters and nothing like Twilight or sparkling vampires...",2009
2,"I honestly thought this was going to be better than Twilight, but it unfortunately turns out the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Surprisingly, there's even some similarities between the two (Stefan and Edward look and act alike, there's a love triangle that's supposed to happen, it mixes ""vampire"" stories with high school ""drama"", the ""vampires"" barely even act like such, many girls from the high school think Stefan ""is so dreamy!"", and Stefan and Elena were dating during the first few episodes even though they knew very little about each other).",2015
10,"I have never read the books, however, I don't understand how anyone could expect for any TV series to be an exact replica of a book. Just my opinion. I have been watching the show since the pilot episode and I absolutely love it. I also happen to be 29 years old and am hooked, so I truly think it's all about what each individual finds interesting, not ""this show is for 13-16 year olds"". I'm not sure how anyone can say they love or hate something after just a pilot, I never really quite understood that. Personally, I think you should give a show at least 3 or 4 episodes to give it a fair chance and to see where the story will go. I wasn't sure that I was totally in love with it after just the pilot either, as I am a HUGE twilight fan, but by the end of the 2nd episode, I found myself anxiously anticipating the 3rd, 4th and so on. P.s. Nina and Paul work great together!",2009
1,"I seriously thing the CW network hires brainless 12-year-olds to write all their scripts. Well, I guess it saves on the budgets. I think they're spending all their money on CGI and plastic surgery. Otherwise why would they hire 'actors' who can't act and look over 40 when they're playing 'teenagers'. I've watched about a dozen episodes of this one and ABSOLUTELY NOTHING has happened except a lot of teen angst. But then that is the network specially and gets them their advertisers. The fact that all their shows appeal to the many brain deficient teenagers in their target audience. Personally I would have turned this one off after the first few episodes, except for the presence of many former gay porn stars. But then they have the 'corporate closet' to keep all the boys. I guess it's run something like the Vatican where they keep all the 'boys' hidden for their priests' consumption. Anyway, the same is true off all their shows, so I shouldn't be surprised this one would be any different. Where is Buffy when you need her?",2014
8,"I really like the episodes, it is somehow fluent and has a taste of Twilight. Maybe it is weird but its shooting is better than Twilight because in watching Twilight you can feel the coldness, silence and a sort of pause which drift the interest of the spectacular away. But in Vampire Diaries, you can feel the hot impression of the characters, hot color of each frame of the movie. These series make you feel more connection to the reality than Twilight. The characters are involved in excellent combination with the setting and the plot. Stephen perfectly reflects his good mood through his face. Elena is another good chosen actress for the character. Because you easily see her bright intelligence and innocence on her face.Damon is just like his name demonic,attracting and tempting person. This good adaptation of the characters to the story makes the film more powerful and better than Hollywood production Twilight thought it is a TV series. I wish Twilight was shot by Vampire Diaries technical production team.",2009
1,The vampire diaries stinks. The originals are no longer the enemies of the show. Really? Klaus had been doing horrible things to everyone in the show. He killed and tortured many of Elena's friends and then Caroline fall for him. He has his own show and he is still the bad guy. Every character in the vampire diaries keeps taking turns on who is the bad guy and it gets confusing. Everyone cheers for the bad guys in the show. You can no longer tell which one is the bad guy. Pick one and stick with it.,2015
5,Yes 5 star out of 10 for first 2 seasons But sadly the 3rd season ruined it all When I started to follow the TVD and saw the first season I was eager to watch next season and that too was as good as first one but After seeing 3rd season I think its time to say goodbye to TVD ,2012
8,"In this day and age it's the time of the Vampires. You have Twilight and True blood and Vampire Diaries but don't let them keep you from watching. While many tend to compare it with the two, it's actually very different. Vampire Diaries, based off a series written 15 years before Twilight,is about a girl Elena who just lost her parents when a new guy, Stefan Salvatore, comes to town but with Stefan also comes trouble, his brother Damon Salvatore. This show is definitely the middle of Twi and True Blood. It has a romance like Twilight and the intensity of True Blood. What this show has is a lot of twists and turns that you don't expect.",2009
3,"Take your average Dawson Creek schmutz and toss a few vampires into the vapid teenage drama and you've got yourself the series. Even less substantial than the Twilight series, if that was even conceivable. All the girls are débutante dolls and all the guys are GQ models with plucked eyebrows...none of which have any depth beyond their overlying makeup and impeccable hairstyles. All this being said, I'm sure the series is wildly popular. Which is more than a little sad. And fundamentally why the world will be destroyed *chuckle*...not because of our inherent diabolical evil-ness (even that would be interesting, at least)....but more because of our burgeoning and mind numbing idiocy",2012
1,"Just wanted to say how much I hate this series. My girlfriend is obsessed with it, but I just cannot suspend my own disbelief enough to take it for anything more than bad acting, terrible plot and cheesy cast. True blood was bad enough but at least that had a bit of backbone, this is just bottom of the barrel viewing. Guys I really do feel sorry for you if like me your significant other has discovered this series. Producers should get off the whole vampire bandwagon, it's been done by many and much much better. I bet the producers are probably thinking up their next masterpiece. It will probably be called the ""pencil trolls of the night"". The pilot will be about a girl who gets a pencil troll from their teacher, that then comes to life after midnight and starts writing cryptic messages. It takes a few episodes for her to discover that the messages are actually from her late great grandmother who it turns out...was a vampire!!",2012
8,"So, a high school girl (Elena) fancies a boy (Stefan), who surprise surprise turns out to be THE vampire for her. Of course a love triangle is presented; Stefan's more demonic brother has an agenda to win Elena's affection. Elena's best friend is a bubbly psychic, there is no shape shifters (read werewolves) yet nor mind readers (yet), and Elena is not clumsy (yet), although she does feel isolated and lives in a very small town. Sounds familiar? It should because L.J Smith's books the Vampire Diaries have been around already for last 15 years. This story might have kicked in better if the ""Twilight thing"" wouldn't burn the subject to the dead. That is something to wonder, how the author of the Twilight ever got away borrowing? so direct storyline, in addition items like mind reading and shape shifters/werewolves in context of vampires from Sookie Stackhouse novels by C. Harris, a book which was also published before first Twilight. Apparently one cannot copyright an idea, only product. But wait, the publisher of L.J Smith has announced a new book to the Vampire diaries series called ""Midnight"". There is no ""Sun"" in it, but is this the finger or what?",2009

1,"Vampire Diaries is almost the exact same as Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The story,friendships,mission, almost all of it is from Buffy. I've watched Vampire Diaries first then I watched Buffy. Might I say ,buffy was way better. In my opinion, I liked the whole originality of Buffy where Vamps are vulnerable to sunlight, can get staked, holy water, the whole sha-bang. Some examples of similarities, Buffy-Elena (though buffy can kick her behind any day), Angel-Stefan (the ""good"" vamps that likes the main girl), Willow-Bonnie (main girls bestie who happens to be both witches, Willow can smite bonnie any day), Spike-Damon (bad/good both interested in main girl) and many other similarities. I was so disappointed when I found this out. If you truly like Vamp Diaries I suggest you also watch Buffy the Vamp Slayer. You will find it very much the same.",2012
10,*Slight Spoilers*,2012
10,"Admittedly, it started terribly, full of clichés and cheesy connotations with vampires. But, like most reviews have stated, after episode 4, the show takes a different direction and moves away from traditional vampire themes. It totally excels and turns into a very exciting and watchable television show with an incredibly good looking cast with very impressive acting. The Vampire Diaries is not like any other vampire production,filled with humour,love, violence,sex and without the clichés.",2011

9,This is not a family/drama series.,2011
9,"First post. Thanks to other IMDb reviews, I decided to give The Good Wife a try. And boy I was not disappointed. Julianna Margulies leads a stellar ensemble cast, the acting and script writing is near-flawless, and the weekly stories are believable yet not over-the-top. A nice almost Thriller main storyline flows throughout the episodes, adding a compelling undercurrent to what could have been just another legal drama.",2010
9,"This is the best new show of the season. The ""story within a story"" method is used to great effect, as we follow Alicia's marital woes, the inter-office politics, the husband's efforts to get out of prison, and the family ups and downs at home. Interwoven with these ongoing plot lines, there's a new legal case to tackle each week. I find this show a rich combination of humour, pathos, romance, mystery...",2009
7,"I keep under-estimating this drama; perhaps because there are no big names associated with the production of it - my mistake! This drama continues to capture me hook, line and sinker every week. I am loving it to the point that it has become one of my 'must see' TV shows. ",2009
10,"Why is The Good Wife such an extraordinary show? (I write this while eagerly waiting for the fist episode of Season 7) 1) The character. Alicia is independent, but not a feminist; she sometimes fails, but she never gives up; she is deep, but witty and funny; she has principles, but is sexy; she is true to herself, but dares to experiment and change; she is wise, but you can never take her for granted. In a word, Alicia is brain, morals, fun and passion.",2015
10,"I have not been watching any of the law-firm based dramas such as Law & Order. Therefore I decided to give this show a try. I had already seen Julianna Margulies' excellent role in ""City Island"",which also featured the underrated Andy Garcia.",2010
10,"I have to say that I simple love The Good Wife. When I first saw previews of the show when it was starting, I was a little hesitant to watch it. Thank Goodness I watched it! I LOVE it. I am a mother of 3, and (lets say age 40+), but when I get ready to watch this show I feel like a teenager again. I wait until it is on Demand after it air on Tuesday nights, and I watch it all alone the next day. But I have to definitely wait until my husband and children are asleep. I do not want anyone to talk to me, nor answer the phone when I watch The Good Wife. This show is so great! It is not only interesting in sense of court cases of great interest, but also has awesome personal issues & interests. When my oldest daughter sees me watch the upcoming previews on occasion if she is watching TV, and I say that I LOVE this show and cant wait to watch it when everyone is asleep, she laughs and says it sounds like a stupid show or soap opera. She says the title alone. But she has no idea how great this show and writers, actors & actresses are. I love all the cast, each and everyone one of them. My personal feelings towards the relationship side to the show: I wish Alicia works things out with her husband and just moves on from this. She already proved to everyone that she can get herself out there, work on a great professional level, and let nothing interfere with what happen with Peter. She holds her own. I love Alicia. I like Will also, but I rather see them as co-workers and friends only. I think if the writers put them together it will change the show entirely-as referring to its title. I also love Ely Gold! His character is so great. He can do anything he sets his mind to do. I love when he told Zack's friend Becca off and threatened her when she was putting things out there and hurting Zack's family. He set her straight, I laughed at that one. He seems to be everywhere when needed. Please let him be a regular to the show, and please make him remain loyal to Peter. I also love Kalinda. I am not sure why she hated Blake the first time she set eyes on him. Kalinda has a way of getting things done as well-she is great! I love Diane, and was sad when she revealed to Ely that she will be starting her own firm-I would hate to see them all split apart. On another note, I crack up to myself when they have that lady judge who insists that both parties answer their pleas & comments by saying: ""In my opinion"". I laughed at that one, and enjoy her ruling the courtroom on those days. Well to end this: ""In My Opinion"" this is one of the BEST shows on television. The Good Wife has GREAT: entertainment, drama, suspense and surprises around each corner and always has awesome endings.You also learn a few things when watching each court case. I am never bored when watching any scene, whether is the courtroom, the law firm, Alicia's home or even when they on occasion go for drinks: This is of course is ""IN MY OPINION"" LOL. Please writers, if you read this extra long review: Keep up the good work! AAA+ Show - Simply Love It!",2010
8,"I wouldn't say it's a perfect drama but it sure is entertaining and manages to capture my attention from beginning to end in every episode. Margulies is a great actress, no doubt about that, this show gives her the platform to showcase her acting prowess. The writers have done a good job inter-connecting the law and politics elements of the show, plus there's complicated relationships and family issues thrown in. The characters are all equally brilliant and interesting, my favorite is Panjabi's character the cynical private investigator Kalinda for which she deservingly won an emmy for. Do hope the writers keep up the good work would be a shame to see this be a 1 season wonder.",2010
7,"This show can certainly be relevant with all of the political sexual affair scandals of recent years. As many high profile politicians have been known in recent years to cheat and have affairs on their wives. To name a few you have John Edwards, Mark Sanford, John Ensign, and most memorable was Eliot Spitzer who cheated and had an affair with a hooker that's the theme that this new drama ""The Good Wife"" took a page from and started the book. Only later the pages turn over to new chapters of independence in which new answers and the search for justice is sought.",2009
10,"Pretty obvious that this show had no beginning, or a middle and an end, but a this series full of pace and adrenaline that provides viewers each episode the Wow effect. the ""good wife"" has an outstanding plot . The global ADHD we all suffer from makes it difficult for people to commit. The ego wants a commitment, the body wants quick fulfillment. ""It's not harassment, this inefficiency,"" says one of the officers to the hapless Carrie Agus in the beginning of sixth season. the series producers are effective in making viewers mouth gape in shock and ensure that they return the next chapter. Highly recommended for anyone who loves a scandal, courts and both of them together.",2015
7,"If I were limiting my rating of this show to the realm of present-day American TV, I'd rate it a 9.5. It's the only show I go out of my way to see. And why? Because it's the only one that gets me worked up over the characters, in other ways than by having them murdered or suffering from some dire disease. Dramatic involvement has fallen out of fashion on TV in the U.S.--most shows are too cool to care--and so I take an old-fashioned satisfaction in becoming variously worried, relieved, angry, or cheerful about what the characters are doing and what is done to them. My suspension of disbelief is facilitated by a sharp cast and vivid direction, which puts emotional suspense and its concomitants--focus, pace, mood, foreshadowing--ahead of all else. ",2010
8,"Initially before you watch this show you may believe that The Good Wife is just another legal/political drama but it is so much more. It actually is very witty, intelligent and well researched. The subject matter is also very relevant to today's society. You get an insightful view into the corrupted world of politics and the daily moral struggles lawyers must face.",2014

9,"Across the board every facet of this show is top notch.. writing, casting, acting, directing, production values, etc., etc. It's no fluke it is regarded as one of the best programs on television today and it can stand on its' own merit as one of the best all-time. It's extremely difficult for any show to maintain high quality on all levels from week to week.. but from season to season, it's darn near impossible. This show has well achieved this impossibility. Does it keep going.. it's hoped so.. but you get the distinct feeling that if and when it starts to slip in any category, it will come to an abrupt end. You do not want to have its' legacy in any way tarnished it's just been too outstanding to let that happen. It would be easy to single out a couple of the actors for praise, but we all have our choice favorites. It's been said television programming has been slipping over recent years, that shows are nowhere near as good as they once were... The Good Wife shatters that argument completely. So now it has finally come to the end (after seven seasons), and it would be easy to nitpick the final episode (which seriously was pretty darn good)... but we all know we have been most fortunate to have had a front row seat to one of the best programs that TV has ever recently produced.",2014
1,"This show is awful. The acting is awful and the scripts are awful. Every woman is so super botox-ed that they should call this show, ""Frankenstien's Good Wife"". The lawyers and judges all deliver lines like they are meat-heads. Every character is so unconvincing as a legal professional. I certainly don't know any lawyers or judges that behave or speak like the characters in the show (and I know many lawyers and judges). This is another example of a show that used the ""fast-talking"" style of dialogue to make it seem like the characters are smart when really they just come across as rambling idiots. Furthermore, the plot lines are so trite and predictable. Oh look, Encyclopedia Brown solves the case again. What a surprise! I am so bored of this show being on in my house. I am writing this as I sit next to wife and I wonder how anyone could possibly enjoy something so cookie-cutter as this. I have never been so angered by the blandness of something that it drove me to write a review online. Please make the pain stop. Do yourself a favour and watch something else.",2014
3,"My wife and I have been enthusiastic Good Wife fans since the beginning. The thread in the last several episodes is so awful that we quit watching. The show used to be fun and had a somewhat realistic storyline. Lately this business with the election is so over the top bad writing that it is just irritating. Maybe I'll check again in the future to see if they've come to their senses. If the writers and advertisers want me and my wife back they'll have to come up with better story lines. BTW, jump the shark refers to one of the last episodes of Happy Days when The Fonz jumped a shark while water skiing; the series was canceled shortly thereafter.",2015
2,"I do not know where the research for the Pre-Trial Services officer came from but it is far from what we do in my office. Maybe a bit more research would have made me like the show more, however the faults of legal procedure which we follow do not match at all. Feel misrepresented. We do not interview employers, people are able to be self employed. While we do make recommendations to judges, they were far from the type which were shown on the 5/30/15 program. We do make recommendations for release at First Appearance hearings, bond reduction hearings and revocation hearings, but none as were represented. It is extremely rare for an officer will have to take the stand. This explains why I am having problems with non-criminal law judges and know-it-all criminals...misinformation from media.",2015

10,"This is simply the best TV series in years! I live in Scotland and we had to wait a month or so more than you guys in US to get season three. Next week is week 5 and this season is every bit as good, if not better than the earlier two. The story lines get better as the series progresses and I can't praise the writers enough. When each new season begins I doubt it can beat the last one but it does.... amazingly! I am totally hooked and can't wait for a Thursday at 9pm. My husband knows not to make a sound when its on!!! Excellent writing and excellent cast. I love the ""tension"" between Alicia and Will. I do hope though that Kalinda and Alicia re-kindle their good friendship. Alan Cumming, a fellow Scot is superb in his role as Eli, I hope The Good Wife runs for many years to come. Simply F A B U L O U S!!!!!!!!",2012
10,"The Good Wife in the first season starts as a procedural with some serialized elements (usually a season long story) that maybe takes up 1/4 of each episode.

The relationship formed between the two leads is unquestionably one of the best and is, so far, most endearing. It is impossible to not like them.",2009
8,"I fully enjoyed the pilot episode of Castle. Nathan and Stana have great chemistry, with him providing a ton of comedy as the crime fiction author to her straight laced cop. Castle is an engaging hero with a surprising amount of support from the characters around him, especially with his daughter and his mother. ",2009
9,"I wish IMDb had a decimal system because this show isn't an 8. From what I saw in the Pilot it is a solid 8.5 at the very least. Tho the pilot was fairly predictable when it comes to crime shows that aren't CSI or Law and Order (i.e. one character is a fan of the other. Half way through everything is wrapped up a little too neatly etcetera), it was still an enjoyable romp.",2009
8,"I just finished watching the first showing and I am very pleased. Others and I have been starving for more Nathan Fillion ever since Firefly. It seems he has finally landed a lead role, which he has so definitely earned, in an interesting looking series. At this juncture, I don't have many predictions for the series which is a rarity these days and I think that it will be fun watching Castle and detective Beckett's relationship grow. The writing was quite creative even though it sometimes felt like they were rushing things. I think its possible that they could have made this first episode last another week or two, however, at the same time, its fast pace leaves no time wasted. I found myself sprinting into the kitchen for munchies and racing back in hopes of not missing any of the action. I will definitely be watching this next week :)",2009
10,"This is the best new show this season! I enjoy the Mentalist but Castle is even better. The chemistry between Castle and Beckett is off the charts. I love it. This is coming from a die-hard CSI: Miami fan. CSI: Miami has lost its way showing the same boring story lines and turning into a soap opera. Castle is funny, serious, and smart all rolled into one. Please ABC bring this show back for another season. It will break my heart if they do not. I e-mailed ABC with my opinion so hopefully that will help. I already pre-ordered season one on DVD so that shows how much I love this show. I was never a fan of Nathon Fillion before but I am now. I even went out and bought Waitress just I could watch him. Is it Monday yet?",2009
9,"For anyone of the ""Firefly"" persuasion, you are in for a treat! ABC realized what a gem they had in Nathan Fillion when he did his guest stint on Desperate Housewives, and they quickly got their act together and gave him a series! In other words, Nathan is back!! :) This series has a great start to it, with a strong ensemble cast that brings out a great multi-dimensional quality to the show. It is clever, and sarcastic humor reigns. The plot of the pilot was your typical Crime Investigation approach, but it is the delivery of this fine cast that breaks it apart from other shows. With that being said, I hope that they do develop the story lines a bit better in the future, but no matter what happens, this show is a joy to watch simply because of the cast...especially Nathan Fillion. This character is very much like Mal Reynolds in Firefly, and that is what brought me to this show. The rest of the cast and the great delivery is what will keep me with this show!! Well done ABC!!",2009
10,"As a dedicated Nathan Fillion fan I had to watch this show to support my favorite actor, but a few minutes into the pilot I knew I was in. Not only was Fillion perfect for his role as Rick Castle, but the rest of the cast fits together like a strange, yet very close family. By the end of the episode I was hooked. This show has it all, mystery, intrigue, comedy and relationships, beyond romance. It is relieving to have a show that is not only about the two main characters relationship, but also the daughter and mother and their corky relation to Castle. This show is a perfect ten! Here's hoping it has a longer run than Fillion's other work!!!",2009
8,"Oh, yeah, we've seen this one before....Irresistible-force-meets-immovable object. Opposites attract. Oil and water. Fire and ice...you know the drill. The problem is that when you have a pairing that mixes snappy patter and grudgingly mutual admiration with just a touch of sexual tension, the recipe is only going to be as good as the charisma of the two leads involved, whether it's a sitcom, dramedy or police procedural. ",2009
9,"While the plots may be a bit contrived, the main effort is the dialog and tension between the two main characters, i.e. the Writer and the Detective. This is a reminder of Gable and Russel, or any number of 1930's great couples in the movies when the lack of color images was lacking but the colorful dialog was what made the movies worth watching. It's called Chemistry and these characters are definitely full of it. ",2009
10,"You mix a couple chemicals and bam! Something ridiculously cool comes out of it. This show is so funny, smart, witty, sarcastic, and interesting. Nathan Fillion as Castle is silly and yet also catches every detail. He loves to bug his Det. counterpart, Kate Beckett, played by Stana Katic. Together they make a brilliant team while solving cases. Her being amazing at her job and making sure it's done right. She's smart, gorgeous, and has a biting, dry humour that's always great for a laugh. Stana and Nathan have amazing chemistry on and off the show and make it a very enjoyable hour. Though it may seem like any other murder/mystery/procedural it isn't! It leaves you with too much of a happy feeling, unlike most homicide shows that leave you feeling depressed. It's surprising and very well written. Supporting actors such as Susan Sullivan and Molly Quinn(who portray Castle's mother and daughter respectively) are also hysterical and amazing actors. They bring a light to the set and a special sort of freedom. I can't wait to watch more of this show and I hope you catch it too :]",2009
10,"I have been watching Castle ever since I stumbled onto the episode Manny McDead last year, I was sad that the first season was so short, but was extremely happy when ABC renewed it for a second season. This show is very different from most other crime shows. It doesn't try to capture the grit of real-life police work, instead it has it's own quirky style that still manages to keep everything believable. Another thing that I thought was interesting is that it was almost Holmesian in that instead of relying completely on forensics to solve cases,it uses good old-fashioned logic like Numbers and Criminal Minds without those protracted scenes of people holding test tubes and analyzing them with a machine that you never knew they had before that episode and you'll never see again. As the character's try to follow their ways through the sometimes complex,always suspenseful plots, you try to follow their thought process, and you can sometimes be surprised about who actually did it.",2010
8,"The chemistry between the two main characters were believable.

So, a flirty rich man who sleeps with random woman falls in love with a hot police woman, who chases criminals in high heels, has no knowledge of police procedures and dresses like she is going for a night out with friends. Hard hitting drama this is not, then comes the mystery aspect can you predict who is the murderer well as soon as you have seen all the suspects it becomes blatantly clear to the audience who the murderer is but apparently we still have to go on with the charade of finding the guilty party.",2012
9,"I have said it before and I will say it again. This show has promise and the chemistry is great. Now that I have said that the show will now be canceled. Why do all the good new shows die when the crappy old shows live on! This show has good writing, acting, and characters. There is no weak link in the characters. Castle is a magnificent show and I hope that people give it a chance. I would hate for this to become another New Amsterdam or Dresden Files. Canceled before it's time. Please give this a chance ABC. I'm a College student and I can't watch it when it comes on Monday night but I watch it online or Tivo when I miss it. Just keep the good stuff coming.",2009

9,"If you're looking for a ""realistic"" policier like the LAW & ORDER franchise or THE SHIELD, then CASTLE is the wrong show for you. It is a comedy-romantic detective romp about a by-the-book but attractive woman cop, and the roguish bestselling hack mystery writer determined to irritate, ingratiate, and woo his way into her heart - among other places. ::wink:: A show like this rises or falls on the appeal of the leads, and the wit of the writing - and CASTLE, thankfully, has three highly-appealing leads and clever dialogue, as well as just enough personal drama under the surface to give it some crunch.

And the recently added team Toks Olagundoye and Sunkrish Bala whom are fantastic! They have also participated in the Paley Center for Media in California for over four years. Do you have any questions, bring them along! Do you just want a picture, bring a camera! Do you wish to spend a day with the cast reserve for VIP! If anyone here is looking forward to Monday nights at 10pm Eastern Time for a great comedy-drama-thriller-guest stars' television series, then this is the series for you.

Almost about 90% of most romances seem to be involved in dangerous situation and oddly tend to produce the best kinds of pairings; Rory and Amy/ River and the Doctor from ""Doctor Who"", Marko and Alana in the graphic novel series ""Saga""; you name it. Each of the situations always have a limited amount of time, which is probably why they do what any couple should do interact and how they play off each other, because they don't waste time in saying what their thinking and feeling.",2014
5,"After watching Inglorious Basterds i was really surprised when i saw ratings on IMDb. Didn't expected high ratings and top 250 place. If we can only isolate and rate Christoph Waltz's acting performance i would agree that this movie deserves 10. But he is not alone, and his performance can't cover horrible plot, boring conversations, unfunny characters, alternative QT WW2 fantasy and Eli Roth as Jew bear. ",2009
1,"Reviews of this film are largely split into 2 camps; it's good because, or it's bad despite, it's direction by Tarantino.",2010
1,I simply cannot believe this movie's current rating on IMDb.,2010
1,"For those that have studied WWII, and unfortunately, seen real human brains on the ground, this movie is a travesty, a sadistic farce, and a complete waste of time like most of Tarantino's other questionable work. I do admit to liking ""Reservoir Dogs"" to a point. However, this thing does not even have an original title.",2010
1,"... would you have seen it ? The first scene was very inviting and promising, with a fabulous Waltz and Menochet, and then it slips into the third dimension. A Jewish woman with a black young man managing a cinema (or whatever shop), in France in the middle of the 40s ??? Hitler's attending somewhere without tight security of Leibstandarte SS ??? Where do they all get tailor made smokings in a few hours time, all that, without people noticing that they can't talk french or German ??? You are kidding me. What's the point of this movie ? It has no historic value, no humor, nothing. WWII is a serious matter. This film is an insult to all our parents and grandparents who lost their lives to fight the evil. At least, I would have preferred if there were no reference to historic characters.",2010
1,"Tarantino continues to make idiotic cartoons that at best glorify and at worst encourage violence.

1,"""Inglorious Basterds"" is a movie so clueless, so sloppy, so jam-packed full of half-ass characters and shock-value violence, so relentlessly terrible that I can't even muster the rage and indignation that most intelligent film fans feel toward Quentin Tarantino.",2010

3,"We were really looking forward to this movie and after we watched it, we were glad that we hadn't rushed off to pay for it. Terrible movie. I don't know what Tarantino was trying to do. Usually a stickler for detail, this movie appears to be an offering trading on name only - ie., let's see what crap we can edit together and people will still buy it because it's a Tarantino movie. Given this theory - there a lot of fools giving way too high a rating in here. Were you drunk people? ",2010
1,"Too many morons will believe this is a factual film and those idiots will pass it on as such. It is an insult to the veterans of WWII, and an insult to the intelligence of film goers. The trailer for the film is a piece of misleading garbage that has little to do with the film, and the group portrayed in the trailer should have been called ""The Inglourious Idiots"". Added to all the above is the fact that too many Hollywood drug addicts think that having most of the film in a foreign language makes it a better film. That just proves that much of the Hollywood crowd is a bunch of snobbish, self-important, elitist, and truly uncreative a**es that do not know how to make a good film. I have never been more disappointed in a film. ",2009

1,"as someone already pointed out, a 1 star rating for this movie is to much.",2010
1,"I will never go to another Tarantino movie again. The entire film was worthless. My wife and I both regret that we didn't get up and walk out at the first indication of what the film was really going to be about (which is still hard to determine since it was such a ridiculous storyline...blood, guts, and violence seemed to be the only real theme), but we kept hoping there'd be something redeeming just around the corner. Unfortunately, there wasn't because there wasn't anything that made sense! We, along with a lot of the other people in the audience walked out of the theater muttering ""that was disgusting"", ""what a waste of time"", ""I should've walked out"", ""where was the comedy"", ""that was pathetic"", etc. It actually made us, the audience, voice our disgust and the feeling that we had just been thoroughly ripped off. The only thing of merit in the film was the costuming and the acting ability of almost everyone in the film....there just wasn't a plot/script worthy of their talents. I rate this a 1 because there isn't a 0. I can't quite understand how anyone could rate this higher than a 0!",2009

1,"Hooray for Title Misspellings! After reading reviews and contemplating, my girlfriend and I confirmed that this movie is an utter piece of trash. This movie lost her as one of those Rare Tarantino fans.I wish it were made on nitrate film, and all the copies piled neatly underneath a chain-smoking Tarantino fanboy. The literally needless violence, the plot holes, Tarantino's table-itis sans drama, and absent character development made this a thoroughly painful, glorified montage. ",2009

1,"Tarantino is so full of himself, but the only achievement I can acknowledge is that he has reached unconditional praise and success for movies that are vastly overrated, severely violent, so incoherent that they should be changed to fantasy genre because of their lack of realism.",2016
1,"I attended a showing of this movie locally at the invitation of friends. If this had not been the case I would probably have left without seeing it in it's entirety. I feel uncomfortable living under the same sky with people who would not only take this bit of fluff seriously but actually like it. I didn't appreciate the story line due to having such difficulty with the subject matter, the chauvinism etc.Believe it or not all members of the German Army were not Nazis (members of the Nazi Party) Also if you could consider the history of WW2 dispassionately you would conclude that soldiers of the Elite German Units such as Leibstandarte SS Adolph Hitler,Das Reich, Standarte Viking,Grossdeutschland, etc. Were among the best (if not the best) Soldiers of the 20th Century.You would see this in their performance and also in the making of the man. What makes a good Soldier? Equipment,Training,Leadership, and Motivation. Brad Pit in my estimation is indeed a twit for getting involved in this grotesque imitation of a film.Anyone who makes light of the German Army of the third Reich lacks knowledge and intelligence. Please don't anyone give him my regards.",2009
3,"I'm astonished that this film made the top 250 -- indeed, at time of this writing, number 84. I'm guessing that a number of the reviews are written by one-view enthusiasts who haven't very deep roots in film history or film criticism.",2010
1,"*may contain spoilers* I probably was expecting better from Tarantino because I have to say this is his worst. I prefer Jackie Brown and Pulp Fiction to this rubbish. Brad Pitt stuck out like a sore thumb, only bigger-his character is a real jerk and as far as I'm concerned is absolutely useless to the story. This is trying too hard to be funny. I liked certain characters (Fassbender's Lt. and Kruger's actress) far more than I enjoyed the story. In fact, what WAS the story? The film editing was so choppy. Quite frankly after the scene in the bar with Fassbender and Kruger, the whole film just goes downhill from there. I'm a fan of war films and films that portray the German side, but this certainly cannot be taked seriously with others. This movie got so much undeserved hype.",2011
10,"Think of White Collar as a little bit ""48 Hours"" (the Eddie Murphy, Nick Nolte classic) and a little bit ""Catch Me If You Can"" (the DiCaprio & Hanks rollick). ""Law & Order"" this ain't. Call it ""fun TV"".",2009

7,"If you are a fan of the buddy cop genre (if not, start with French Connection and work forwards), you'll know the basic rules:",2010
10,"I must say that I was one of those who watched the pilot and was not taken in at all. I thought that the theme for the series was too banal and overused. However, after I read the plaudits for the series, I decided to watch the 2nd and 3rd episodes and I must say I am really glad that I watched them. ",2010
10,"I am glad that this show is on the USA network, or else I might never have heard of it. I am so happy that I got into it before the pilot even showed on TV. The first time I saw a commercial promoting White Collar, I was overwhelmed by how awesome and semi- original it appeared. It's not the most original show of its genre, but the way that it is composed and delivered is profoundly different than other shows. The actors (ALL of the actors) are superb at their jobs. This is a must- see for everyone, no matter who you are. You will almost certainly love it and become hopelessly devoted. Oh and I am happy that Matthew Bomer is finally a lead in a show that is practically guaranteed to last a while. Thank you.",2009
10,"well written, actually funny shows with believable characters are almost impossible to find. Thankfully, USA has provided all those qualities and more in this new show. The pilot starts out humorous and interesting and only gets better. Each character that is introduced is three dimensional, unlike the cardboard cutouts most shows are packed with. And viewers will find themselves rooting for both the conman and the FBI. The dialog is both funny and smart. And the pace of the show is perfect. Fast paced, but not impossible to follow. I don't watch much TV, as I consider most shows nothing more than a way to waste an hour of my life. But if this show continues on the trend the pilot set, I'll be back every week to check in on these fascinating characters. White Collar is highly recommended for anyone who appreciates intelligent and witty TV.",2009
10,"I disagree with this comments, Im a fan of House, Dexter, CSI Miami, etc. and I believe that White Collar has the same potential to be a TV series than any of my favorites. Today is the first time I watch the show (by the way a USA marathon) and I love it, was looking to by the first season but I see this is the first one, can't wait till comes out in stores to buy it, keep the good work USA, criticism is good, positive or negative, but listen to the people and not to just one critic. The combination of good guy bad guy has always worked, and with such good actors and actresses White Collar has everything that is needed to become a hit, keep bringing good stories to the series, congratulations to the writer and all the team for bringing me, personally, another good TV series to talk about. Thanks, Rey",2009
9,Don't get me wrong. I think this is a fantastic show. They have great individuals playing all the different roles. Neal is great! He has a great personality and just the right amount of attitude.,2010
9,"USA has been a great provider of action-comedy-drama shows for quite a while; series like Monk and Psych have greatly entertained me. White Collar is not short of the quality work USA can offer by any means. The story is fresh and new, although it did sort of steal the idea from the ending of the movie Catch Me If You Can. I won't divulge into the story at all, mainly because whenever I do that i usually give away too much, but I can definitely tell you that is it great, and every episode so far in some way has a very interesting twist. The characters have very unique personalities and you will easily take a liking to them - Matt Bomer really was the picture perfect choice for the main character, Neil Caffrey - charming looks and pitch perfect acting delivered the perfect character. The music is okay, there's nothing too amazing about it, but visually the show does some good things; how they position the cameras in some scenes were good choices, although sometimes a wee bit awkward. It might not be as good though if you don't start at the pilot episode, but it's not fully required since for most of the newer episodes they have a summary of what went on in the first few episodes. Overall though, this is a great series that is definitely worth your time to watch.",2010
7,"This isn't discovery channel. It's about as believable as thinking that CSIs interrogate witnesses. If you want thought out dialogue and plot, watch HBO's Rome or BSG. There isn't much that's meaningful here, but who in hell would look for it anyway? I'm rather surprised to see the vehemence with which people are denying the quality of this show. What did you expect, NOVA? This is a buddy cop drama. Sure, it has some laughably contrived moments (serendipity seems to follow Matt Bomer around like an overly affectionate puppy), but it's all in good fun. Mostly, I think the writers are simply attempting to show what a charmed life Bomer lives in comparison to his working stiff Fed partner-- perhaps to a fault. These moments faded quickly after the basis was set-up (but aren't many pilots like that?).",2009
10,"I did it. Finally, I did it. I watched White Collar from the first episode to the last one. A few years ago, I had a TV at home, and I remember coming into the room, with my parents watching it. It wasn't even close to the beginning of the show, but I was immediately hooked. But I was much younger, and couldn't understand the beauty of this show.",2016
10,"White Collar is absorbing, the protagonists are extremely well developed characters and each show contains a mix of clever craftiness and cons as well as ambitious humor. The complexity of the story line as well as its representation targets intellectually demanding viewers who are sick of the everyday junk-shows thrown at us. This is a quality TV show.",2014
9,White Collar has that along with a great writing and a great cast. And just really a show that clicks.,2013
10,"Well I started watching this show because it filled a time-slot. I had very little interest in it, but was pleasantly surprised as the story progressed. Tim DeKay and Matt Boomer worked well together from the inception of the series, but I think the best addition has to be Mozzie (Fozzie – or whoever). Willie Garson's secretive and 'off-the-grid' verbal snipes are always worth the wait. Gotta love paranoid criminals. Mozzie is the glue that binds the whole show – I do not know if I would watch without him. I also noticed (and this is a good thing) that other FBI characters are forming amiable personalities. I can never watch shows where all the performers are either trying to, 'out-bad-ass one another', or the police are all just plain dumb, or a politically correct group embraces their flavor of racism or sexism in order to make their point. Now stepping off my soapbox – this is an enjoyable show that is well written and directed. The team of Burke and Neal is a clever idea and, 'White Collar' is well worth the time to watch it.",2013
10,"There are many great television series currently airing, but White Collar seems to be the only show that's enjoyable to watch whilst concentrating solely on a core set of characters.",2011
3,"The show started great. First few episodes got me hooked with a good story, good actors, a lot of charisma and charm and an amazing chemistry between Matt Bomer and Tim McKay. However, it doesn't take long to realize that the show is pretty stupid. I mean, I get that it's supposed to be more comedy than drama, but man, some things are just ridiculous. Just think about how many times Neal took off his anklet, by stealing the keys or just playing around the system. That alone would have put him back behind bars. And then, he escapes almost every time they take the anklet off for his undercover missions. Which is another thing that bugs me. Would FBI really send a convicted criminal, good guy wanna be that has no preparation or knowledge of the rules and regulations, off on undercover missions? Not only he's not prepared and has no training, but he's supposedly one of FBI's biggest catches and I assume his photos would have been all over the media when they finally got him. Unless the show takes place in a parallel universe where facebook and paparazzi don't exist. But it's all right. They can send Neal on the field because, as unprepared as he is, he still knows more about undercover than Elizabeth who, nevertheless, is always present in their cases. Seriously, this looks less like FBI and more like a family business with fancy suits and badges.",2015
9,"The premise is pretty simple... A high-brow version of 48 hours! (Cop and Convict working together) The show is actually very well written, and very enjoyable. The handsome and clever thief uses his tricks and knowledge of art and treasure thievery to help the White Collar Crimes division of the FBI nab the bad guy, in lieu of prison time. It's a great premise! ",2011
4,"I started watching White Collar from the beginning. It sounded like an interesting concept and raised hope to see a modern Crime show with more interesting cases than the usual CSI murders and so on. I've seen all episodes in Season 1 and 2, but haven't started with 3 yet - and probably won't:",2011
5,"The USA Network has long been known for putting on original series, and you can clearly tell when they care about something and when they're just going to toss it away. White Collar is part of their latest attempt to join the 'Leverage' movement in making a show about criminals who fight crime. While Leverage is a silly little show that knows exactly what it is, White Collar has me just a bit baffled. It's hard to tell if it's serious or not.",2010
10,"Shortly after the pilot episode began, 35, maybe 40 seconds into it, I had another favourite TV show. Matt Bomer's Neal Caffrey, along with Tim DeKay's Peter Burke, and a no less than AMAZING support cast (including Tiffani Thiessen! and Willie Garson!), give White Collar that little something extra over other shows vying for ratings in similar time slots. The smooth and clever combination of intelligence, humour, forbidden romance, deceit, action, testing of loyalties and SOO much more (not to mention an extremely handsome cast *cough cough* Matt Bomer and Tim DeKay ;] ) make White Collar one of THE COOLEST TV shows on in a REALLY long time.",2010
9,"Usually when TV reviewers say smart, witty, or charming, what they really mean is the show has the potential to be those things. White Collar is one of the few shows that actually delivers. Between the deviously charming Neal Caffery (Matt Bomer) and the surprisingly clever Agent Peter Burke (Tim DeKay) this show was off to a wonderful start. Throw in a few supporting characters that are more than names on a cardboard cutout and you have the makings of a true hit.",2010
2,"The first thing I thought when I watched the show was, ""this is a cheap knock-off of Suits"". ",2013
8,"I love the characters on this show - they are what makes it rise above the clichéd and tired episodic cop show, well, that and the ""catch me if you can"" inspired premise of an ex-conman helping the feds, which is handled in a fresh way here. My absolute favorite character is Mozzie - he is so endearing and funny.",2010
2,"I watched the first episode of this, which only had 2-3 stupid bits of writing in it, and the actors played reasonably well, although a bit clichéd in body language and style. The concept is pretty obvious, has been done before many times (Eddie Murphy, Nick Nolte in 48 hours, etc) but there is nothing wrong with the concept.",2012
10,"i am very critical of television. i hate clichés, shows that try to teach you things, and more than anything ripoffs(like the fact that family guy takes most of its plot lines form old simpsons episodes). but Community is original, and dead-on with every punchline. Abed has some of the best delivery i have seen in years. everything he says and the way that he says it is side-splitting. the whole episode i am just longing for more words to come out of his mouth. brilliant beatbox/rap at the end of episode 2 by the way. Joel McHale is a great leading man who plays an ass trying a little harder not to be an ass(maybe its just to get a girl but regardless). i was confused about the purpose of chevy chase in this (dont get me wrong, he is hilarious, but in this he's just a side character) until i saw the second episode (Spanish 101) in which he does a Spanish presentation that is golden. no more doubts in my mind.",2009
10,"The promos for this series really turned me off. Another dreary, predictable story about the uncaring horny guy pursuing the lovely stand-offish female? Wow was I wrong! These characters are refreshingly complex and give us lots of surprises in an all too short half-hour. The concept of a bunch of mismatched community college students bumbling through life is rich with possibilities and, speaking as a former community college student, has the ring of truth all the way through. All the actors are wonderful -- especially Gillian Jacobs and Alison Brie. The cherry on top is the amazing Chevy Chase, so oft-criticized for being the self-indulgent ham, who delivers as nuanced and compelling ensemble-sensitive performance as you are ever going to see. My sense is that this show has got some serious legs!",2009
10,"This show is just awesome. Me and my chap are often having to pause it or rewind it just because of the amount and the level of humour! All the characters are great. Sexy Jeff pulls the best faces, Pierce is just brilliant (he is very nearly my fave), Annie and Shirley bounce of each other and have some great moments, Britta is cute, funny and geeky and Abed and Troy take over the show when they have scenes together. Even watching the pilot episode i was laughing my bum off!!! Spanish professor Chang is also great. My only criticism is that Troy needs a story line or a few more scenes as he is so so funny but the end scenes with Abed and Troy more than make up for that. They are genius! The whole cast is just great and after watching the whole first series in one weekend i cannot wait for the next one. One of the most clever, entertaining and FUNNY shows i have ever seen. Along with the other fans. I beg you PLEASE do not cancel it! Here in the UK i am sure we would pick up this series for at least 5 seasons, its just THAT good! :-)",2010
10,"As a European, I am not really a big fan of typical US comedy. Yeah I can laugh at some scenes of friends, Seinfeld or any other main network sitcom, but they never make want to rewind and watch a joke/situation again.",2009
9,"Finally, after a long dry-spell, I have found a live-action TV show that actually makes me laugh again.",2009
10,"I'm so happy for Joel McHale (The Soup) to have found a comedy that works for him. It's great to see Chevy Chase back on the screen, in a role that is so unlike himself but that he plays so convincingly that I often forget I'm watching the guy from ""I'm Chevy Chase and You're Not."" I also love seeing Donald Glover in a supportive and recurring role on a show- he's a wonderfully talented writer and has been in the business for quite some time, working with Derrick Comedy and even writing some of my favorite episodes of 30 Rock. Glover's on screen relationship with Abed is hilariously funny- the two have an amazing chemistry, and people who think that's weird are ""just jealous."" The ladies are also quite brilliant and unique, each with their own distinctive personalities and eccentricities. The ensemble cast is quirky and the characters are extremely diverse but somehow fit together first as a Spanish study group and then as friends. Moreover, after dropping out of my first pick of universities, I myself attended a community college for my sophomore year, and Community does well to portray the...uniqueness of this type of school. The student body is quite diverse, and the cast of the show represents all the stereotypes of people who end up in such a place. However, it also reflects the actual sense of community that can be formed in a smaller university and the bonding between students who otherwise would have never met let alone become friends. Oh, and we can't forget the mix of normal professors and absolutely insane ones ! What more is there to say ? I love this show; I think it's The Best new comedy for 2009-2010. I'm crossing my fingers and toes that it goes another season !!!",2010
8,The first time I've heard about community was this summer when I was taking the 'Paramount' studio tour. When we where walking around the decors I was amazed about how real it looked! Since I work for TV in Belgium I know how decors look and how it's been shown on TV. But when you walk around in the studio it's like you're really walking in a school! But most of all the way that the Director shows it on TV is just amazing! the lighting also plays a great part of creating the mood and weather which looks like real! GREAT JOB! ,2010
10,"This show is hilarious and at times I find it inspiring. Favorite episode so far is Season1Episode3/Introduction to Film. The show is very clever, the characters are such a mismatch it does what the Breakfast Club does in revealing human nature and sociology. The community college they attend often tries to give a university feel and in doing so also it parodies universities.",2009
8,"I started watching this show late in the season, and accidentally came across it by accident on Hulu (I meant to click on something else). I am glad I did.",2010
10,The fall of 2009 was a great year for comedies. Two reached out to me with both having Blast from the Past actors (Chevy Chase and Ed O'Neil) which are Community and Modern Family. Viewers have found two new shows to laugh at once again with fresh new witty humor and great acting.,2009
8,"When I first started this show, I was loving it SO MUCH, enjoying every character and their silly humor. All the nonsense and the cartoonization they suffered throughout the seasons reminded me a lot of Scrubs, which is my favorite show of all time. The world they built for the series is inspiring and it activated my imagination to the point the characters and that reality kept living on in my head.",2016
8,I was a little skeptical when I first watched Community because of all the pro-mos that were done. It seemed like every commercial break had a pro-mo saying how great this show is going to be...which usually turns me off a program.,2009
10,"This show is vastly underrated. It gets overlooked next to popular titles like The Office and 30 Rock. Not that these shows aren't great, I love them, but Community is far superior. Not only is it hilarious, it's incredibly creative and unique. You never know what to expect. In one episode, the plot will simply be that the main character, Jeff Winger, gets back in touch with his old lawyers buddies. A few episodes later, contaminated meat turns everyone at a party into mindless zombies with an appetite for flesh. And then skip a few more episodes and you get a story told entirely in claymation! ",2011
10,"I'm not really a comedy guy, I find most comedy show really hard to watch and not funny. I have a lot of favorite shows, but there are only 2 shows that made almost cry and sad because it felt like some part of me die with the end of the show (I know, its ridiculous but its the truth.)",2016
7,"The first seasons of Community were an absolute joy. The writers managed to create an intellectual and off-beat sitcom, which is a welcome change in a genre that has seen tons of generic titles come and go. By blatantly calling out their own clichés for what they were - usually through the character Abed - they were a very special kind of comedy. One that made you mockingly laugh at something you were thoroughly enjoying at the same time. Perfect examples are of course the paint ball episodes, in which external influences force the school into an absurd mayhem.",2014
9,"Ever find yourself flipping through your channel listings over and over and over again, throwing your remote at your dog, and complaining about the lack of quality television programs to your Twitter followers? Well, odds are you just haven't given the shows that are actually worth watching a chance. I made the mistake of avoiding the hidden gem that is Community for nearly two years. The often unappreciated NBC comedy follows the antics of a study group consisting of seven Greendale Community College students from all different walks of life: the egotistical and recently disbarred lawyer Jeff Winger (Joel McHale), the outspoken liberal Britta Perry (Gillian Jacobs), the dynamic/inseparable nerd duo of socially awkward Abed Nadir (Danny Pudi) and former high school jock Troy Barnes (Donald Glover), the pill-head turned sweetheart Annie ""Adderall"" Edison (Alison Brie), the morally driven Shirley Bennett (Yvette Nicole Brown), and the oldest, most inappropriate member of the group desperately trying to stay hip Pierce Hawthorne (Chevy Chase). The cast teamed with the incredibly talented writing staff will have you chortling by yourself at the witty jokes and fresh comical situations. Community's ability to develop such intricate relationships between the characters in such a short amount of time is what separates the award winner from the competition. In between the laughs, the show has a lot of heart, allowing viewers to build an emotional bond with the odd group of characters who, despite all of their differences, share a sort of symbiotic relationship. The show is simply in a league of its own. Community has the perfect mixture of comedy, emotion, and storyline, not to mention an incredible amount of action packed into a few paintball episodes. Like Fox's Arrested Development, Community, likely entering its last season, will go down as one of the most under-appreciated shows of all time.",2012
10,"Community is brilliantly scripted: the dialogue is ingenious, the acting is superb, and the creativity is off the charts.",2011
10,"This is an unusual show with great imagination. The cast is superb with many actors giving a special touch to it, from Chevy Chase to Ken Jeong. The show has a balance between traditional humor and the unexpected. I found this show from an interview with Gillian Jacobs in Craig Ferguson and fell in love with it. While some parts can be slow, the creativity is what keeps it going. I rewind and watch parts multiple times to make sure that I did not miss any pieces. My wife and I watched all episodes in both seasons in one weekend. I am surprised that it is rated 81st show in the last year. I hope that it does not get canceled. Assuming that it keeps the current standard, it can easily go for a few more seasons.",2011
10,"What I love about community is the versatility of the mish-mash of characters and the way their chemistry just works. You have a bit of everything. In Jeff Winger you have the smug, speech making likable anti-hero. Troy Barnes, the silly, immature, lovable ragamuffin. Shirley Bennett, the lovable innocent bubbly one. Annie Edison, the gorgeous and bubbly, point making, try hard, witty young lady with an unexpected history. Abed Nabir, who's 'dissability' of Aspergers Syndrome is made light of by making him obsessed with pop culture, meaning endless film and television references which drives the cinematic element of the show. Britta Perry, who's witty, self obsessed persona bounces of other characters with hilarious consequences and finally Pierce Hawthorne, played by the fabulous Chevy Chase, who's hilarious, inaproprism lands gives him one of the greatest one liner characters in recent years. Not to mention the supporting cast, who are excellent, played by Ken Jeong, Jim Rash, Dino Stamatopoulos and John Oliver to name a few.",2011
9,"What an excellent show! It is witty, funny and keeps you wanting more. I love the cast of this show, everyone fits their characters well. I feel like the study group that was formed offers a bit of crazy in all kinds of forms. I like how we meet the characters from the beginning and get to be a part of their lives as the show develops. I found season 2 to be even better than season 1. I have a few favourite episodes but overall I can watch any episodes more than once. There are few shows I would re-watch and this has been added to my list. I feel like the humour in this show is very creative, as the situations are not the typical comical situations that you would expect. Everyone in this show contributes to the comedy, from the Dean to the lunch lady, again a great cast! I can't wait for season 3!!!!",2011
10,"Premiering in 2009, ""Community"", created by Dan Harmon, stars a fantastic cast of actors, portraying characters from very different stations in life, as they all come together in the hopes of receiving a higher education (well... ""medium"" education is more accurate) at community college. Though each character is very different, and many don't seem like the types to hang around with one another, the seven leads eventually come together, first starting as a study group, before blossoming into a sort-of family.",2011
10,"If you haven't seen Community, shut off the Big Bang Theory and watch this show. This show; by all intends and purposes, is a masterpiece of television. It's probably one of, if not the best TV comedy since Friends, because what makes this show, is not one single thing that stands out amongst everything else, it's the writing, and more importantly, it's the characters. But rather than siphoning off jokes and set pieces from Friends, Community creates its own unique situations and creates comedy gold with it. Another thing I love about the show; it doesn't need to advertise its most famous cast member; Chevy Chase to get attention, because all of the characters and actors do a fantastic job. Now before I conclude this short review on why Community is the greatest television comedy, I have to mention Troy and Abed, who in my opinion are the greatest TV comedy duo since Bert & Ernie",2015

1,"Bad expectations, movie even worse.",2009
7,"I just saw G.I. Joe, and I must say that I actually enjoyed it. This is NOT a masterpiece. This is a fun, Summer action flick. The so-called professional critics who obviously miss that point do not deserve their cushy jobs. The action is unbelievable, non-stop, breathless, and requires a total suspension of disbelief. The critics that have a problem with that should remember one thing. This is a movie based on a cartoon that's sole purpose was to sell a set of toys to 5-12 year old boys. Nothing more. Expecting ""War and Peace"" from this source material shows a lack of insight and intelligence from most of the reviews that I have read. If you like action films, you will enjoy this one. If you want angst-ridden characters stopping every five minutes to discuss their feelings... pull the stick out and move along to a sappy low-budget romance; this isn't your kind of film.",2009
3,"I came in with low expectations and got even less. I'm kind of offended that someone got paid to write this because its essentially a big-budget movie made with a fan-fiction caliber script. The plot riddled with holes, characters speak in clichés and the laws of physics are completely ignored. The female characters are treated with the action-movie standard sexism, and there are some subtle racist undertones as well. Seriously, 12-year-old boys write text messages that are more coherent than this script. The screen writers should use their payday to refund the tickets of everyone who went to see this movie.",2009
1,"First off, I would like to say that I created an IMDb account for the sole purpose of warning others about this terrible crap movie. At first, I was really excited to see the GI Joe movie. I got to the movie theater, and my friends and I were the only ones in the theater. I didn't think anything of it, I just thought that being alone would make the movie even better. Now I know why I was the only one in the theater. GI Joke was a horrible movie. It is a contender for the coveted title of the worst movie of the year. This movie was awful. I have pooped out better movies than this. The acting-crap. The casting-terrible (who cast Marlon Wayans in a serious part?) Character Development-absent Fight scenes-overdone and absurd Special effects-decent, but not good enough to distract me from all the suck around it. The only cool part was when they were chasing the car in Paris, but I have a hard time believing that one of the guys could catch up with the other after falling back like half a mile, but neither of them could gain thirty feet to catch the car they were chasing. This movie was sooooooooo cheesy and predictable. Who would have thought that duke and Anna would end up together? Who would have thought that snake eyes would killed his brother in the final showdown, and still keep his vow of silence? Who would have thought that Marlon wayans would have ended up with the redhead? And what the **** is up with cobra commander? He's just darth vader with a monocle. And why in gods green earth would they show you cobra commander's face?!? That's unacceptable. Shame on the writers, shame on the directors, shame on the actors, producers, and editors for making such a disgraceful movie as this. Do yourself a favor and burn your ten dollars. It'll be more amusing than spending it to watch this crap.",2009
7,I watched this film last night and luckily I had no high expectations. As a fan of the G.I Joe toys when I was a kid (back then they where called Action Force) I had a good idea of the characters and story before hand. I am glad to say this film stayed true to most of the original concepts with a few tweaks for the better here and there.,2009
3,Oh my god.,2009
1,"May contain Spoilers: From the very beginning of the movie I could tell it was going to be horrible. The writing was awful, the special effects looked lame & the acting...don't get me started. The worst in the movie was Marlon Wayans and this has to be Dennis Quaid's worst performance (aside from his awful turn as Doc Holiday in Wyatt Earp). Everyone seemed so wooden. I actually busted out laughing when Cobra Commander comes on the screen. The only thing worth watching was Sienna Miller.",2009
1,"well, i went into the cinema with no expectations about the movie, having never played with the toys as a kid, not really seen any of the trailers or hype, and not read any of the reviews about it. To be honest, the only reason i even went to see it is because i had already seen time travellers wife. i was not disappointed, i had no expectations and left the cinema after 2 hours wondering what on earth i had just been watching. to anyone thinking about paying to see this movie, save your money, buy a brightly coloured tin of paint, and a brush, and watch that dry instead. it will be more entertaining, i promise, and you will have a newly painted wall to show for the effort too.",2009

8,"OK, I had almost every GI Joe toy growing up. I also watched the cartoon. Being a young kid during the 80's was awesome. As far as I am concerned, the toys and the cartoons from that era are the best. However, after first seeing the preview for GI Joe, and seeing that they now wore mech suits...... I had very low expectations for the movie. Just figured they were trying yet another way to milk money off of the remainder of 80's cartoons/ re-imaging.",2009
7,"Please, take note that I rated this film 8 only because of it's value as an action film, but that's exactly the point I came here to get across. Everybody seems to have the same argument when they trash this film.. ""it's all effects and no brains or dramatic undertones"". OK, that is true, I've got to admit, but then again what kind of movie were these people actually expecting to see? Huh?! ",2009
1,"I went into this ""movie"" with low, low expectations. From the trailers alone I could tell this ""movie"" was engineered for the mindless drones that make up the majority of summer blockbuster audiences. I imagine the only people will actually enjoy this ""film"" are the types of zombie slugs that clap and yell ""BIG BOOM! SEXY LADIES!"" when they see this. This movie request little, if any thinking at all to enjoy. I got far, far less out of going to see this than the faintest glimmer of hope that this would be even half-way decent, let alone watchable. It is seriously hard to describe with words how terrible this ""movie"" is. I am not in any way a fan boy or a fantasized G.I. Joe fan, nor am I comparing this to the source material (which I have seen some of). I am reviewing this movie solely for what it is: A disgraceful atrocity against mankind.",2009
2,"GI JOE (2009) had far too many explosions and loud sound effects, and not enough coherent believable story. Okay, I know it's a comic book but it still has to be believable. The plot itself was okay. The whole thing about the nano-mites was intriguing. It was a kick-butt cool weapon, but the whole storyline of implanting the nano-mites inside humans made it dumb. They always take these plots too far till they become stupid and contrived. The acting was just average, at times laughable.",2009

You'd have more luck watching half way through a Disney Pixar film.",2010

1,"This Movie Truly Sucks, its a Joke. I watched it on DVD and just kept nodding my head. Very Start of the movie, the inactive warhead were supposed to be so sensitive that pot holes on the road were to be avoided, yet the Weaponized ones later in the movie went through complete destruction of the vehicle yet they survive. The manufacturing company MARS supposed to be playing with both sides, would be so easy to pass the warheads directly to the enemy but the movie went through the elaborate plot of first giving the weapons to US and then let the enemy steal them... What a Joke, would be so easy just to give it to them. The G.I. Joe base in Eygpt is a Fortress yet the so easily breached with no alarms nothing. Entire City is built under water yet no one knows about it. Twp missiles were fired both in opposite direction, one for Moscow the other for Washington DC, Marlon Wayans destroys the one for Moscow just few seconds before the Impact which is fine but suddenly appears above Washington to destroy the other, no mention of WARP Speed, even Superman could not do this, he had to make the planet go back in time to prevent it. Not even worth for DVD!!",2009
1,"it was far far too long, the only good part was in Paris when they wore the suits (basically from the TV trailers), an unusually silly film that I would honestly recommend anyone to wait until it appears on DVD or better to save your money and await T.V. in 3 years. I'm trying to put into words how bad this film was and it's difficult... . honestly... . I was just hoping it would end very soon and throughout thought more about writing a comment on IMDb during the presentation as opposed to trying my hardest to enjoy it, if you had to live your life in Hell, this film would only have to do a Groundhog Day and you will then know what true torture is. Sienna Miller is useless, Christopher Eccleston from Salford gives the worst Scottish accent ever (I think he must have watched Braveheart many times over and asked Mr Gibson for some help). Dennis Quaid is... . terrible! it must be the worst part he's ever played, by the looks of things on this film he came right out the back end of Martin Short and planted himself in this massive black hole of an enigma. the only thing that got me at the end was Snake Eyes did not speak, wow that totally shook me up!",2009
1,"This Movie is for people who saw the Commercials, and maybe played with the action figures when they were kids but never read or saw anything about G.I.Joe. When I first saw the trailer for this, I knew I had to see this movie, I was like a kid at Christmas and couldn't wait for the morning to finally open the big present, only to find it was a rock... I would say a lump of coal, but at least that would be useful for something other than to throw at someone. Something I would like to do to the writers, director and producers of this movie... I don't only want the money I wasted on this movie back, I want the time that was wasted on this movie. It doesn't matter if you were a fan of the Comic book, or the TV show... I personally liked both, but where did they get the idea to make Cobra Commander and the Baroness brother and sister?? Oh yeah, and Cobra Commander was Dukes buddy? and the Baroness was Duke's Fiancée?? I have an idea, let's remake the Wizard of Oz, and have the wicked witch be the good guy and Dorothy be the evil villain... I think it will work as well as this movie... When I first see Snake Eyes, I think yes, this rocks... Little do I know they screw up every major development in the entire story line of either. It looks like they try to follow the comic book story line, except Scarlett is Ripcord's love interest, she is not with Snake Eyes... There is so much I could talk about how awful this movie is, but I can't. I didn't care for the second Transformers Movie, but if I had to go watch either one of these two films again, it was a much better movie than this one. I warn all of you that have not seen this movie yet, do not go, if you love the TV show and the Comic Book. I don't want to see anyone else disappointed like I am.",2009
6,"This movie may have a questionable script, some sub-par actors (Some were surprisingly good for a popcorn movie which is applaudable) and some Team America style action (They seemed to cause a lot more damage to Paris then the terrorists plan to) but the film can not help but be entertaining. It has what Transformers 2 had which was good special effects, but what Transformers 2 lacked was entertainment which this movie definitely has, even if it is n't a very good movie from a movie point of view.",2009
1,"Another ruined childhood relic. Terrible plot, terrible actors, terrible use of the franchise. The only good thing, like most movies nowadays, is the special effects. But who really cares? That is a dime a dozen. You can really see the butchered Transformers producing background in this movie. Way to ruin two old-school childhood icons. Now let's get some ""good"" actors, not just in shape and a flavor of the month. Some good writers who are uncompromising and actually fans of whatever they are redoing. And most importantly good producers with a vision, not just a ten minute script and million dollar effects with a stamped brand on it.",2009
7,"I have to confess I'm not much of a G.I. Joe fan when I was a kid, partly because the other Hasbro product in transforming robots had more appeal to a boy than a bunch of plastic figures in military garb.

5,"I just don't get it. Stephen Sommers ""bounces back"" from the colossal disaster Van Helsing, only to give us something worse. The fact that this piece of s**t took $170 million to make is more talked about than the movie itself, and for good reason. When you spend that much money on a film it usually at least looks like money well spent, despite Sommers (look what the same studio Paramount did with $30 million Cloverfield). Guess what, writing doesn't cost that much money, and clearly there was no real effort in that department. Why, when you can spend some of that money on insane practical stunts and create memorable sequences like some other directors do, would you spend it on creating bases under polar ice caps and the sands of Egypt, which look like cartoon sequences edited into live - action? The CGI was BAD, very bad. The action was (as expected) non stop, stereotype and irritating. The stunts were non – existent, as everything was CG. The women kick more arse than everyone else. The Paris sequence was pretty much everything you see in the trailers and clips, disappointing when you see the whole thing instead of quick cuts. It was always obvious that this film would hide a lack of substance with style, but quite frankly it was not very stylish. Snake Eyes is sadly immensely under used, Channing Tatum is the worst actor I've seen since Hayden Christensen, pathetic musical score, pathetic dialogue and attempts at humor even from the usually – funny Marlon Wayans, completely non – memorable performances from everyone else, Dennis Quaid might as well have not been in the movie, for everyone who's watched the trailers and exclusive clips, that's pretty much all there is in the movie. It is, at best, pathetic (even by Stephen Sommers summer blockbuster standards). Hard to think Stuart Beattie could write a screenplay this bad, you'll see what I'm talking about if you're unfortunate enough to watch the characters' so – called ""back stories"" and the now requisite ""leading onto a sequel"" ending. Cheesy, cheap - looking (which I still cannot comprehend), not cool, worse than sister concern Revenge of The Fallen, and I have a horrible feeling Stephen Sommers may have destroyed a potentially mind – blowing franchise even before it kicks off. Since every other franchise seems to be doing it these days, who knows, maybe a ""reboot"" with another director? Unheard of for a second film, I know, but this is how bad it is and I do not want to see it die before it's born. Saving grace (if there is such a thing for this film):",2009
1,"The movie was horrible. - Changes were made to characters that were unnecessary. - The dialog was poor. - The acting atrocious, with the exception of Sienna Miller who actually showed a bit of range. - The plot was contrived.

I think i got it: they all got up in a bad mood in the morning, and, not wanting to be the odd guy out, set out to criticize every flaw this movie has. Which has plenty. But, again, what's the problem? it has the same flaws the previous three movies had: underdeveloped characters, uneven rhythm and a ludicrous plot that tries to handle a hell lot more than it can in just about an hour and a half of running time.

4,"Like fellow 2009 superhero release Watchmen, Wolverine is that rare comic book film which almost appears inevitably more likely to please audiences that are not fans of the source material. However, unlike Watchmen, which adhered so closely to its source material that a falling short by comparison proved inescapable, Wolverine's inevitable backlash of fan outrage stems from its flagrant disregard for its source material. The film casually mutilates and re-writes the comic book context of its source material with the cold disdain of its protagonist, hacking one of the most genuinely compelling, subversive and horrifying superhero back-stories into the worst kind of safe, familiar, PG rated commercial dross. All of Wolverine's compelling comic book edginess is distilled into a flaccid script which forgoes exhilaration for only occasionally impressive fight/chase/explosion scenes, complexity for eye-rolling cheese and broad humour, and story cohesion for an attempt to cram in far too much subject matter and avoid the true dramatic meat of the story.

Overall all the character in this movie are well composed. I like the way Victor was put together in this movie. he really put up a strong show. Rest all other X-Men did well but were overshadowed by Wolverine and Victor but that what the movie was all about ... the origion of wolverine. I m a Big fan of Jackman. He really deliver his best.

10,"To tell you the truth, i never expected this movie to take me to that point.I felt like I was 13 again. it was excellent. By far this is the best X men movie made, that brought out the real Marvel X men experience which i loved. Obviously from the first X men movie it self we knew that Hugh Jackman was the perfect Wolverine, and he has turned out to e a legend. i don't think anybody else in this world could bring out the animal and portrait Logans sensitive side both at the same time. It was brilliant. And it would be a crime if i don't mention the spectacular performance by Liev Schreiber as Sabertooth AKA Victor Creed. My god he was the Villain of the story, but his reflection of sabertooth made all X men fans to fall in love with him. I fell in love with that character. it was like the true cartoon sabertooth from the 1980's was brought to life. I hated the sabertooth that was in X Men 1. it was like a bad soft toy. Finally what made this movie the best X men movie is not the graphics or the effects, or sound, It was the Strong Story which happen to be the true story of Wolverine. Don't get me wrong though the graphics effects, sounds were excellent. Then as every Critic i have a few Criticism's as well. The main thing what i don't like in this move is what they did to dead pool at the end. That never happened!! they made that awesome mutant a freak!! I loved his performance (could've done better) and i love that Character Dead Pool. They could've used him Differently. Having said That overall it was a brilliant movie. All true Old marvel comic X men lovers would worship this movie. I can't wait till they create the next movie and i really really love to see my all time favorite one of the most powerful Mutants, APOCALYPSE!!!! in it... One Last thing; Only a true old X men lover could get the fullest impact on this great movie or should i call it the great piece of ART done by Gavin Hood, David Benioff, Skip Woods And Hugh Jackman?",2009

Its well written and the characters are likable. And there is comedy and snappy dialogue to make it a touch edgy. I especially liked the offer of cookies to come inside the warehouse. The main character, who is a first leery, jumps right at that in a very funny way. If you liked the X-Files weirdness and Eureka's comedy, this is for you.",2009
7,"I've watched the entire run so far and after a good beginning, what has happened to it? By S4 mid-point, its turned into the most dreadful, ham-acted, soap opera where the artifact mysteries are largely overwhelmed by the childish acting - especially Pete who appears to have gone from being slightly immature macho man to an emotional 7yrs old. He reminds me a lot of Seeley Booth in Bones on a bad acting day.",2013
9,"SyFy (nee ""The SciFi Channel"") can usually be counted on to air some pretty interesting series; everything from humorous scifi light (Eureka for instance) to the darker, intense stuff (Battlestar Galactica and it's spin off, Caprica). I would definitely put ""Warehouse 13"" into the previous category rather than the latter. It's a cool quirky series that knows how to have fun with it's six primary, very different, series regulars. Saul Rubinek's Artie Nielsen, who acts as a sort of curator to the warehouse is the gruff, often exasperated anchor point to the rest of the crew and I have to admit: I wasn't crazy about his character at first but he really grew on me. He's kind of like that grouchy uncle you have that really has a heart of gold underneath. C. C. H. Pounder (as regent Mrs. Frederic) is one of those powerful actors who plays such a strong but subtle role brilliantly. Love seeing her on the little screen after such an amazing amount of varied roles on both the tube and the silver screen. The whole cast is a nice mish-mash of personalities that compliment one another but I have to admit a growing favorite of mine is Allison Scagliotti's ""Claudia Donovan"", who's funny, bright, endearing and occasionally flawed which makes her all the more likable. She winds up getting into some seriously funny messes that require the leads (an equally humorous Eddie McClintock and perfect straight-man Joanne Kelly as agents Lattimer and Bering) to bail her out. The weekly series always has some really cool artifact that belonged to some famous historical figure that wields some kind of science-bending power to it and the leads are tasked with retrieving said artifacts without getting themselves killed or some such other disaster. This show is good and it's getting better with every new episode (thanks to excellent writing) and it's definitely worth checking out if you're not already a fan.",2010
9,"This show reminds me of the old ""Friday the Thirteenth"" television show, where two young adults are tasked with locating possessed items that cause problems and lead to the deaths of innocent victims and users of the items. Although this show does remind me of that dark and sinister show, ""Warehouse"" has a lighter agenda and makes for a well developed television show. I also have to mention that the special effects for a show that appears to have a decent operating budget are pretty good for a weekly television show. The characters are very deep and keep you wanting to learn more about their pasts. If the show does not get canceled, I plan on watching this show on a weekly basis. Thumbs up to SYFY in their new format on a very good and well thought out show.",2009
8,"What a surprising little gem Warehouse 13 has turned out to be. I feel the creative team in control have only just begun tapping into the almost limitless supply of stories available to them with this cracking premise they have conjured. Not surprising really as one of the show's creators is Jane Espenson who wrote some of the best and funniest of Joss Whedon's episodes for Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel and Firefly.",2009
4,A great concept with all the potential on the planet to rival Heroes and X-files totally let down by appallingly bad acting and scripts. The whole show has a Jewish flavor to it with the actors constantly bickering in the genre of a stereotype Yiddisher household.,2012
10,"A nice mix of X-files, Fringe, Supernatural and the Carol Burnett Show. The actors seem to share a chemistry and have sufficient depth for a Syfy series to draw me in. The special effects are not overused, considering the subject, and the sprinkling of personal stories add to, rather than subtract from the overall storyline. I call it a success, and eagerly anticipate the second season. I have not bought any Television series on DVD, but this one does tempt, does it not? X-files it's not, but neither does it take itself so seriously, for which I give it a hearty thumbs-up! Enjoy, and next time, you bring the popcorn!",2010
1,"What can I say? I just really felt the urge to rant about warehouse 13 after accidentally sitting through the first season. I'm sorry but, who the hell writes this rubbish? ",2014
6,"I have watched this series from the pilot on. I really liked the first couple of seasons but things started to go south in my opinion after that. The plots got kind of weird with Arty using an artifact to bring s dead agent back to live and then he went bonkers for a few episodes, killing Lena, my favorite secondary character, until Claudia stabs him with another artifact thereby bringing him back from the precipice. Now that Arty has returned to the land of the living and things are more or less back to normal. I feel the series is losing its direction of the first couple of seasons. It was funny, interesting, and different than typical syfy shows. It still has a lot of the same stuff but I can't put my finger on it but I am not as enchanted with it as I was. I very much liked the addition of Claudia, she brings youth, humor and even sexy to the show, plus she is the tech guru that gives Arty the business from time to time. I will probably keep watching but this show is not the show I originally saw.",2013
2,"Warehouse 13 review: Season: 2, Episode: 11 ""Buried"" is 43:30 of my life that I will never get back!!! Let's call this the ""WTF"" episode... yet they should have ""Buried"" the episode.",2010

1,"If this program is our intro to the new ""SyFy"" Channel, they can keep it.! Warehouse 13 is the Ed Wood equivalent of ""The Librarian,"" ""Indiana Jones,"" and any other program that offers superior entertainment about mystical objects. Just replace the superior CGI special effects, good acting, and interesting scripts for those movies/programs, and we have Warehouse 13. The first episode introduces us to the most irritating people who deservedly belong in the desert where they can't harm or annoy anyone else. Unfortunately they supposedly have oversight over some great and powerful objects, like Houdini's wallet. Uh-huh. All the main characters fall in the usual seen that, been there category. The female is intelligent but bossy and pushy. The male is handsome but a bungler. The keeper of Warehouse 13 stutters and flutters and never makes a clear statement. The three stooges are now in charge of the great Warehouse, which is actually an incredibly cheaply made metal building in the sand. The interior is not much better, using more cheap metal and wood shelving to hold the great and powerful objects. My friends and I could have produced this if we had a couple of thousand and an outdated video cam. It would at least be more creative than this stupid stuff.",2009
3,"The idea of artifacts with special powers had already been put into a successful film - Syfy brilliant miniseries ""The Lost Room"" in 2006.

4,"Two sexy Federal Agents dealing with the Paranormal? It seems impossible to not make the X-files comparison. With a few exceptions (that occurred well after the characters were established), the X-file episodes always played it straight. The show worked because it took its mythology so seriously. Warehouse 13 tacts towards a light, humorous take, perhaps for no other reason than to avoid a direct X-files comparison.",2009
3,"Warehouse 13 is a high concept synthesis of The Librarian, The Lost Room, Ghostbusters, and myriad other shows. It is the kind of bricolage the SciFi/SyFy/sigh...fie Channel has come to specialize in.",2009
2,"After the big build-up of this home-grown program, I was eager to watch. The promos looked interesting, but they always do. Geez, where do I begin? The plot is about two Fed Agents pulled into a mysterious warehouse to guard and/or retrieve powerful items. I watched the whole pilot. Actually, I was pretty much checking the clock after the first 15 minutes of watching the female popping her eyes out of her head and the male ogling all the women. The Warehouse keeper was even more annoying, bungling around pushing cookies on these two. The ""Warehouse"" is very disappointing, just a rusty corrugated metal building in the middle of nowhere. They probably paid some farmer to use his derelict building for the exterior shots. The sets are minimalist and the special effects will remind you of every ""good"" movie you've ever seen. So will the ending of the Pilot. It's soooo very Indiana Jones, without the better acting, visuals, etc. The lack of originality makes this so very boring. I've seen much better programs last only one season. This one will probably go on for ten years. It's cheaply made and will fill in dead space. We'll watch other channels......or our DVD's.",2009
2,"Just watched the pilot episode and won't probably bother with any more. The writers seem to have grabbed a bunch of scenes and ideas from, among others, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Ghostbusters, and The X-Files, thrown them into a bag and shaken them up. The result was less than satisfying.",2009
1,"The only thing imaginative about this series was the premise, no wait, the base idea was plagiarized from Raiders of the Lost Ark! ",2009
9,"I disagree with the various posters who have said this isn't grown up enough for a more mature audience, I think it's pitched just about right. I just turned 30 and I'm enjoying every minute of it, and why not? It's quirky, light, easy to watch and the actors all give fine performances. Eddie Mclintock and Joanne Kelly make a great partnership, Saul Rubinek is, as always, brilliant, CCH Pounder has the right mix of gravitas and compassion and Allison Scagliotti as Claudia is electric to watch. With Roger Rees as McPherson providing a credible villain and Genelle Williams as the lovely Leena putting in a (for me) surprising twist, it all makes for some very entertaining TV.",2009
4,"After watching this show a few times, it occurred to me that this is nothing more than a rip-off of the television show ""Friday the 13th, the Series"" that aired approximately 20 years ago. There is nothing original about this show, and it demonstrates again how unimaginative the writers for the ""Siffy"" channel are. ",2009
2,"Just watched the pilot. Watchable, just, but a big disappointment. Certainly no match for the original which was (for its time) a riveting piece of sci-fi. The plot itself is OK, it is just so clunking and obvious. Big alien spacecraft hovering over our cities is a good trope, but an old one, and it would be nice to see a new take on it by now (District 9 managed it nicely). Ominous rattling crockery? Check. Big reflections in skyscrapers? Check. Troubled priest? Check. So many unbelievable things - why does no one- NO ONE! - ask the aliens where they are from or what, exactly, they want? Surely the TV guy, on being told not to ask any awkward questions in his interview with Anna, would realise he had the scoop of the century (hey everyone, the aliens are evil! Run for the hills!)? How come that just a few days after these things turn up life seems to be continuing as normal? And why is 'Universal Healthcare' a concept so strange to American ears that it could only come from another planet?",2010
7,"The creators of this contemporary cut of V seem to have missed the critical elements of the 1983 original, that being character development, a large cast portraying many interesting interleaved plot threads (think any 1970s disaster flic – Airport, Towering Inferno, Poseidon Adventure et al), likable characters (who could ever forget Jane Badler as Diana? or the highly charismatic Willie played by Robert Englund ?)",2010
6,"I was worried that this, as a remake of a cult series, would be either bad or silly, but I really liked the pilot episode, and I'm looking forward to seeing the next one.",2009
9,"Having not been familiar with the original ""V"" the series by creator Kenneth Johnson, and upon first glance at the previews and TV spots, I gotta say that what I just witnessed was the best pilot episode I've ever seen. With it's many parallels to our social climate in the world today, the new series plays on our fears and perceptions of those who are strangers to us who at first are well-meaning and docile but their ulterior motives are hidden underneath. That gives ""V"" verisimilitude while still retaining a Sci-Fi setting. I was tense and on the edge of my seat throughout the proceedings of what the characters are experiencing as the ""visitors"" announce their presence to the world. I suppose some will say that the new ""V"" is not as good as the original, but I for one, enjoy this new version and will be tuning in to see how the events unfold and how profoundly their effects will have on those embroiled in this event that may change the face of mankind forever.",2009
9,"...and that's saying a lot considering the usual angst-y, inexpensive-to-make-therefore-let's-clone-it-family-drama shows the network seems to keep adding on or re-newing. ""V"" was exciting right from the start and the second episode was a good follow-up to the premiere, fleshing out the main characters a bit more and what drives them. Elizabeth Mitchell is well cast as straight-shooter, no-BS FBI agent Erica and it's great to see her back on the tube after ""Lost"". Another great bit of casting is Joel Gretsch as Father Jack, a priest torn between doing what he thinks he's supposed to be doing and what he knows in his heart is actually the right thing to do. Gretsch was great as the power-hungry military man in the sci-fi mini ""Taken"" so seeing him here playing the clerical good guy with heart shows the man's got talent. Morena Baccarin and Scott Wolf are also excellently cast as Anna the high commander of the Visitors and as Chad, the button-pushing journalist. Though I enjoyed the original series as a kid, this one is a worthy update for the twenty-first century. Some stuff has changed (names of characters; how long they've actually been here before the arrival of the ships, etc.) but the premise is similar enough: aliens arrive on Earth...are they good or bad? It took courage for ABC to air a unique series like this (i.e. ""sci-fi"") when pretty much all of the other mainstream, non-cable networks are sticking with the usual safe stuff (family dramas, medical dramas, cop dramas, 30 minute sitcoms) so I hope they truly give it a chance to grow and catch on. It's that good.",2009
1,"Could not believe how rushed this first episode was as well as the stupidity of it all. The original series was phenomenal...it took time to reveal secrets, build suspense, the music was awesome (eerie them to V the Final Battle). It was believable. This new ""V"" is CRAP! The storyline redundant and impractical (visitors greeted by press and no UN government or dignitaries??) Impractical or realistic (All the visitors look like Models??) too fake and shallow and unbelievable..I could not relate or find attachments to any characters... This whole production lacks depth, emotional pull, and the overall feel of banding together that the original had.....this feels forced, redundant, and seems to be made to appeal to an unsophisticated young audience of young teens....SUCKS!!",2009
9,"I loved the mini-series ""V"" back in the wayback - though I thought the series itself fell apart by the end of the first season - so I wasn't sure how they were going to pull this one together.",2009
9,"This is a remake of the original series V where aliens invade earth. However this is not the original series, so don't compare it to it. It reflects the new changed world political scenario. Unlike the original, in this the resistance is labeled 'terrorist', and there are many shades of gray. The show has a lot of potential, and so far in (9 episodes) it is headed in the right direction. The show does tackle some interesting issues, and handles then reasonably well. To say it is simply an action series is untrue. In fact it does make one realize that if a real alien invasion took place what it may be like. Of course a lot of hypotheses have to be made to come up with such a scenario, but you cant hold the assumptions the show makes against it. The most interesting aspect is how the humans react to the V, as initially they come as saviors. This leads to certain social implications, and even religious implications, and show does not shy away from delving into them. This is show is politically savvy, and that makes it really interesting to watch, because despite the obviously science fiction set- up, there are underlying truths in it about are social make-up.",2010
3,"Who wrote this cr*p? Didn't anybody in pre-production ask, ""Didn't anybody see the enormous spaceships coming?""

5,"I was 20 years old when I saw the original V. That was a big TV event, not a cult series (a cult series implies no one watched it, V was widely watched), and it was riveting. The character development was very good from what I remember, and you did not see the premise of the aliens until well into the series. You had your hunches and were distrustful of the aliens but even when you found out they were mostly bad (yeah we also didn't think there would be a few good aliens till later on either), you didn't know HOW bad they were and that they were lizards! Well after a fairly decent character development up to the first commercial break or two, we knew everything there was to know about it all. Now it's just an action show. I mean so much for the element of surprise or the premise of any suspense. My wife had no idea what this was about and I made sure to not reveal anything telling her it was ""people"" from another planet coming to earth. Well before the first episode ended she knew everything. I'm not going to be all that disappointed because it's no big deal to me, I won't be finishing it thats for sure, but I may look for the original and show that to my wife. Even though the effects are way better now, it doesn't have Michael Ironsides or Marc Singer or Robert Englund in it and it sure as hell does not have any SUSPENSE!!! And whats up with the crucifix crashing down? The writers really have some hidden agenda's that are not that well hidden. And did that resemble New York City to you? I mean come on, looked more like a version of people in Kansas, no realism at all, if you see that ethically homogeneous a population in New York your looking at a 70 year old film, not today, no way, even the homeless looked clean. I also don't recall anything putting down the US government either, I don't really remember seeing Washington DC in any of the shots, I guess that was a sacred cow for the writers but they sure did dump on the Christan faith, oh brother. Got to also love the way they tried to make the journalist so ethical, don't these writers know that now all they do is read teleprompter's? Got to be some elitists from the left coast with all these errors or that this was written down for pre-teens to 17 year old's. I mean the effects looked cool and it actually started out decent, but in the first episode they already have a resistance movement and they just landed? Totally for the short attention span, 5 of 10. See the original, it was very good. Watch Battlestar Galactica if your looking for decent sci fi made today (pssst, they have aliens in that series also).",2009

10,"Best new show on Australian television this year. We don't get much science fiction in prime-time but this is awesome. It has something for everyone, alien conquerors for sci-fi fans and dramatic storyline for fans of drama. I originally watched the broadcast from the US in November as Channel 9 Australia decided to delay the launch until after the Winter Olympics and I was blown away as to how great it was. I grew up with the original Kenneth Johnson Mini-Series and spin-off series and had been waiting for his 2nd Generation to be made into a series or movie but after a lot of talk and speculation nothing. I then heard of this re-imagining of V and thought it would be like all the other re-make of late but after the first four episodes I was pleasantly surprised at how different it was to the original. The creative team behind this need to be applauded for taking an established piece of work and making it something distinctive and engaging. AWESOME!!!!",2010
1,"I found that this show tried to rip of aspects of several older great shows. ""The Invaders"".IE: they have been hear for years infiltrating us and melt away when they die, and some unlikely hero finds out and starts fighting back. Kind of also akin to ""The First Wave"" and of course them being Lizards like the original ""V"". This show seems to be trying to mix several older shows together while adding a Bit of ""X-Files"" to the mess and current politics on anti terrorism. If people want to see the good shows watch the originals.........The acting seems to be very wooden almost like they know the show sucks but they agreed to do it so they try to do something. I have yet to see a remake to be better the the original but in this case the remake seem to have but done while at a all night kegger a two year old might have been able to have done a better show.",2009
8,"Well the first episode was good, a little fast, I would have preferred more of a mystery/investigation feel with the FBI and the priest characters slowly piecing together the truth which then leads up to the big reveal a few more episodes in. However, the whole media manipulation theme and the seduction of the young and the vulnerable in society to the Visitors cause was very well done.",2009
1,"It's obvious that the first poster here hadn't seen the original series. The original series was interesting at the start of episode one and continued to be good until the end. The plot is similar to the original but the acting, effects and spacecraft (Transparent at times)are extremely bad and after watching episode two I can't imagine this returning after the first four episodes are aired. Not to mention that I think there is a six month break between episodes four and five. If that's the case I can't imagine that will help an already weak series return. This was probably done on an extremely low budget and it really shows.",2009

5,"The new V television show is suffering from an attempt not to give away that which everyone already knows, no recognizable social commentary, and a complete lack of action. On all three counts it is extremely inferior to the original series, even if we consider for how poorly the special effects from the 1983 version have held up over time.",2010

Nobody expects a great story when they see the ""American Pie Presents"" (what does that even mean?) moniker, but a little variation here and there would be pretty nice. I mean, come on. Another batch of hapless (not to mention unlikable) virgins getting into sexual misadventures? Another previously unmentioned Stifler cousin? Another utterly pointless appearance by Jim's dad? You know your plot elements are desperately uninspired when they make ""Band Camp"" seem fresh. The movie's also very unstructured, it's basically just a series of barely related sketches. Wouldn't be that much of a problem if the little vignettes were funny, but the supposed highlight of the movie consists of faux-Stifler getting raped by a moose. Creative stuff right there. The makers even seem fully aware they're making crap, but all they do to solve it is adding more frighteningly plastic boobs. This is just painful to watch.",2012
1,"Frankly, I would give this one 0 stars if I could!",2009
2,"Pretty much what you'd expect from yet another straight-to-DVD attempt at capitalizing on the already thinly-stretched ""American Pie"" name.

Nor is there any other reason to call this movie ""American Pie"", aside from it being about high school kids trying to get laid and containing a character named Stifler (who does not remotely measure up to the name).",2009
3,"Yet another ridiculous American Pie spin off, unrelated to the first, that has now been spit into stores for kids to buy and call ""the best movie ever"". Just great.

4,"this movie did not bring up to American pie standards the story line should have been looked at more carefully the actors for me should not have played the part, stifler is not a stifler if they want to make a new American pie again they need to bring up their A game like kicking off the actors and going back to Noah Levenstine's time when he was young because all the movies have pretty much said that he was a god. I watched the movie and after looking at stifler for the first time i knew this movie is the worst American pie, the story line had so much potential but they messed it up. This what happens now with movies now a days :(",2009
6,So... this is the latest edition to the surprisingly long-lasting American Pie series. But what many people want to know is whether it is any good. It follows the plot of most teen-sex-comedies with a group of hopeless guys with their only ambition is to get laid. I know this plot seems overused (having been used in a lot of films) but I think that The Book Of Love brings a new take on it. As it comes to the conclusion that respect and love is the way to get sex. ,2009
4,"At first I thought it couldn't be much worse than the last one, but guess what! It was an even bigger waste of time. It's not the typical low-quality comedy that will at least make you laugh a bit and you will forget all about it as soon as it's over. It's more like a parody of the worst clichés ever. Only problem is it's not supposed to be a parody (or if it is they just didn't make it clear). It's something like the American Pie Paradox: the first 3 films set a really high standard (funny, original to an extend, well shaped action) and the ones that followed were more like a new low in the history of comedy. What surprised me was the fact that it was not even as bad as Naked Mile. At least there were a couple of funny lines and 3 or 4 funny scenes on that one. But this one? You can just leave the room for let's say 15' , come back and realize that you didn't miss anything at all. Total waste of time.",2010
1,"I fell this movie is so horrible i actually made an account here,which i previously did not have.I just have to say this movie is crap compared to the previous 6 movies.i have watched them all and have not been let down until his one.none of the actors were recognizable other than Eugene Levy, who was in the previous movies.and don't even get me started with Stifler.there was not enough of him even though there is no need for him because this ""Stifler"" is not good at all.This movie goes on my list of terrible comedies(Epic Movie and Disaster Movie included in list).There was not a single,i repeat,not a single moment in the movie where i actually laughed or had a smile on my face like the previous movies.I consider myself to have good taste in comedies so i might know what I'm talking about.But let you be the judge and don't take my word for it.But eh, id rather u take my opinion cuz u should not waste ur money on this crap. Maybe instead of hiring actors who don't deserve to be called actors,they should get the original crew to make another movie and catch up on Jim's marriage,Stiffler with Michelles sister,and Finch with the Fox aka Stifler's mom grawr. Thats pretty much it ladies and gentlemen.And by the way, screw 1 out of 10 stars,it 0 out of 10.",2010
1,"I won't talk about the dreadful plot, just talk about why this movie is so bad. Just stick to AP, AP2, AP3TW, APTR, as those are the only decent (and true) American Pie movies. This movie was terrible, and it seems like the writers wanted to show off their sexual knowledge, rather than focusing on actual humour. The only real American Pie character in this movie is Noah Levenstein(Jim's Dad), portrayed by Eugene Levy. ",2012
5,"i must say, i had higher expectation. i thought they had good concept and the trailer did show promising movie but i was a bit disappointed. most of the movie they just repeated the same thing, getting laid, instead of focusing on the book. more focus on the book could be much better. i would cut some party time and add the search for book writers. i felt like i was missing something.",2009
5,"The Book of Love, quite interesting? well to be honest no it is not. Losing the virginity is the simple whole idea from the beginning of the movie to the end which makes most of the audience curious. In other words, a classical American college movie. I did have fun a bit because it was nearly as good as the first 2 series of ""The American Pie 1-2"" OK OK, it was not so close but still average. As a conclusion, if you have a precious 90-minute-free-time and you could not find any other movie to watch, it is quite fun. If you compare with the 3rd to 6th American Pie series and you liked them, then watch it because it is better and better. The acting was simple and not professional but I am pretty sure that you already guess that. The scene was ""Not bad"" but could be better. Still, not good enough. I hope this American Pie series will end with a very good finale.",2009
1,"To start with , I ve watched every single American Pie movie that came out on DVD's , loved the act and the actors as much as the content . This movie is nowhere near what we would call American Pie for all those who have watched even one of the past American Pie(s) . This piece (crap I might add) movie is closer to porn than it is to the American Pie most of us loved and laughed at , not only is there no humour or anything near that but the whole movie concentrates on ""Fantasy Tits and Naked Bodies"". Was patient enough to watch the movie till the end although I had already thought about destroying the disc a dozen times , actors were as if acting for their 1st time and hadn't it been for Leveinstein I wouldn't go on finishing the movie .

8,"SO OK maybe its not your usual suspects from American Pie, buts its for a new generation of AP! I think that this movie was pretty funny I looked at some clips online and was LOLing I can't wait to see it...Brett Michaels is in it and he has a pretty funny part!!! I think the premise is the passing of the American Pie Torch to a new generation...this is why I think they went back to the roots of the Book of Love! they boys revamp it and make it new and relevant for today. Sure maybe the dialogue has more to do with getting laid then anything else and I am sure there are tones of topless bitties running around but I think The movie is Fun and not meant to be taken too seriously!",2009
1,"My god this film was terrible. The stifler character was pathetic, he had no charm or charisma and wasn't cute at all. The rest of the male cast were also really bad, they weren't funny, just really plain. As for the female cast. The amount of disgusting fake boobs in this movie is just vile. OK we all get that guys like boobs, but protruding, hard, circular balls of plastic fakeness, is NOT attractive and i don't see how any guy would like that. I think there were only 2 girls who didn't have a boob job in the entire film. I watched it with my boyfriend and we both agreed it was terrible, he wanted to stop watching it after about 40 minutes.",2010
7,"OK so I decided to watch this movie when i received it on DVD a few nights ago and I thought it was pretty decent. Its no means like the original American pie movies (first 3 movies) but its still pretty good. In my opinion, its better than the last 3 spin-offs (those were a joke). Book of love had interesting characters and they weren't really annoying and weird. It also had a few funny scenes, like the opening scene where the main characters does pleasure with a peanut butter sandwich, and a scene with ""monique"" lol. I had some low expectations about this movie because I've heard some good reviews and some bad ones but I was expecting it to be poor, but I was surprised, it was pretty good. It isn't on the level of the original American pie movies but that doesn't mean its garbage. Although there wee a few weird and dumb scenes. Overall, i liked the movie and it was a thrill watching it",2010
7,"Just as I love watching all the National Lampoon movies, American Pie movies although not as good as the first few, but still enjoyable to watch is The Book Of Love. Different actors and similar story line, but still titillating and got better as the movie went along. It's gone straight to DVD as it's not rated as going to be a huge movie, but for lovers of the previous ones, this is still good enough to enjoy. The harsh critics will hardly rate this movie, but for the average person who wants to escape and just watch for a bit of fun, they'll enjoy it more. It was a nice touch to see some old favorite actors from this genre included, such as Tim Matheson, C. Thomas Howell, Eugene Levy, Robert Romanus, Christopher Knight and Curtis Armstrong (Booger from Nerds). There are a couple of nice looking girls who will no doubt be appearing in future movies, Beth Behrs and Jennifer Holland. I'll be looking forward to the next American Pie when ever that might be.",2009
8,"As far as on again, off again film series go, American Pie has had its good and bad. I am pleased to say that the new installment in the series, The Book of Love is a perfect example of the good it has had. Splurging out new, young faces, such as Youtube star Brandon Hardesty and newcomer Kevin M. Horton, along with star of The Little Rascals movie Bug Hall. While all these fresh young faces make the film hilarious, the film is that much more funny with such classic faces as Eugene Levy & Rosanna Arquette. The film also features more than a handful of celebrity cameos ranging anywhere from Dustin Diamond to C. Thomas Howell to Bret Michaels. The film starts out with a semi-socially awkward teenager named Rob (Bug Hall) with his equally socially awkward friends Nathan (Kevin M. Horton) & Lube (Brandon Hardesty, who steals every scene of the film that he's in). When Rob floods the library, he must clean up and finds the legendary sex bible the high school they attend has. The book has been hidden under the book shelf and has water damage, so it is up to him and his friends to rewrite the famous book of love. While the film is predictable with typical situations and you won't remember for more than a couple of minutes after the final credits role, it's actually surprisingly extremely funny when you're watching it and definitely worth a shot.",2010
3,"When I first saw the title, I was surprised by another series of the American pie. Too bad it's xxx-rated and can't be watched in Denmark, because of the policies. The actors are poor, and were not even decent. John Patrick Jordan who plays Stifler in the new American pie, is really poor. We all know that the Stifler should always be arrogant, but John could not deliverer it correctly. It makes the movie poor and just really slacks on the entertainment. All the actors did not have the ""American pie"" spirit like in the others series. It really brings the movie down, and painful to see. I did not expect that it would be this bad, because the AP series has never been like this!",2009
1,"Seriously, who is paying to watch these things? This is the seventh American Pie film - despite the fact that any humour, charm or originality that the original had had run out about halfway through American Pie 2. The soft-core porn element is totally defunct in the internet age, and the plots have come to resemble episodes of Skins written by a Barbary macaque. In fact, Skins is worth mentioning - as it shows that teen comedies can actually be funny, well-written and intelligent. Compared to that, tripe like American Pie 7 is just insulting to teenage boys. Surely, this has to be the last of this franchise - I cannot understand why anyone would be paying money to watch or rent this tosh.",2012
1,I'm disappointed in this movie.,2011
2,"Yesterday I saw the first and the second film of American Pie, and I saw the movie alone and I had to laugh all the time.. Today I saw the latest film of American Pie; book of love, seriously I haven't laugh one time.. The only thing I did liked was that Eugene Levy was playing in the film again. The actors were playing bad, the movie was so unreal (in the other American Pie movies there were situations that could happen to myself, in the book of love it was all fake) and things like Stifler got anal by a bad animated elk isn't funny at all. I hope there will be a new American Pie movie only they should hire good actors who make movie funny, they have at least to make one other movie of American Pie to make good the book of love. So my hint is to not waste your time and money to this movie, it's a worst of the American Pie series.",2010
8,"About a month before State of Play came into theaters, I read an article in The Washington Post (I live in the D.C. area) about the realism of the news industry as portrayed in the movie. One of the Post reporters served as a consultant on the set and I must say that he seems to have done his job. Almost every aspect, from the constantly chaotic state of the newsroom to the reporter-lingo, feels authentic and true to reality. While there are occasional times when the movie's main character, the reporter Cal McCaffrey, strays from the usual ethical and professional guidelines, there are logical explanations for such instances that are given in the movie. At one point, Russell Crowe even ad-libs a line about the outdated technology he has compared to the state-of-the-art computers given to Della Fry, Rachel McAdams's gossipy blogger: ""I've been here fifteen years, I've got a sixteen year old computer. She's been here fifteen minutes and she's got enough gear to launch a f***ing satellite."" This line was inspired by the feud between print journalists and their online counterparts that, according to the Post reporter, exists in real-life. Because journalism is so crucial to the story of State of Play, every minute detail contributes greatly to the believability of the film as a whole and it is this attention to detail that really elevates State of Play above the average political thriller.",2009
7,"A gruff old-school reporter (Russell Crowe playing his A-game) becomes personally entangled in a breaking news story surrounding his old college buddy turned congressman (Ben Affleck, not as bad as you would think) and a young female aid who died under mysterious circumstances in the surprisingly plausible political thriller ""State of Play"" from director Kevin MacDonald who was previously responsible for ""The Last King of Scotland"". Though designed as a throw-back to paranoid investigative thrillers from the 1970's, relevance is gained when the massive cover-up revealed becomes a vehicle for the filmmakers to explore the death of print news at the hand of digital mediums.",2009

Visually distraught, he leaves a hearing in tears and sets off a media circus. Seasoned reporter Cal McAffrey (Russell Crowe) was his roommate in college, and the two have remained friends. In a bid to quash the political blogging of junior reporter Della Frye (Rachel McAdams), McAffrey sets out to find the truth about the story.",2009
7,"I attended a pre-release screening of the new film, State of Play, with anticipation of seeing both quality work from actor Russell Crowe and screenwriter Tony Gilroy. I also entered the theater with a degree of apprehension about how well this feature length film would measure up to the brilliantly acted and crafted six-part BBC series that was the basis for the film. Crowe well-embodied the tenacious old-school investigative journalist that we've come to know from classics, such as ""All the President's Men."" However, the multifaceted ensemble of journalists, portrayed by a rich range of actors from the BBC series (John Simm, Kelly MacDonald, James McAvoy), is missing from this feature film where Russell Crowe does all the work. The complexity of the plot, which includes the competing professional interests and emotional needs of the characters in the British miniseries, is largely eliminated in this big screen version. Ben Affleck and Robin Wright Penn do not seem to appreciate and respond to the high stakes events that could turn their lives inside out and upside down. What this film shares with the miniseries is the glimpse into the mechanics of running a journalistic investigation under the pressure of time and editorial interference, but the personal stories suffer from not being fleshed out and made to feel real and compelling to watch. It is not fair to compare one piece of art to another, but when two productions are related, and you've seen the original, it is difficult to view the second production without prejudice. It is like trying to unring a bell.",2009
8,"Whether you loved em' or hated em', espionage thrillers made up a generous portion of cinema from the 1940-50's. With fast paced, edge of your seat story lines, plot twists, political undertones and dramatic personal struggles with morality, nobody did it better than Emeric Pressburger and Michael Powell. Their attention to character detail and it's purpose in conjunction with the narrative gave heart and humanity to this new string of movies which could have fallen into similar (yet shallower) alpha male characters such as James Bond. Never the less, we cannot forget that ultimately if it weren't for their vision and invention of the genre, Hollywood may have never capitalized on the staggeringly profitable Bond franchise that's still going strong today.",2009
9,"Crowe brings his A game (despite an occasional accent slip) to his role as a world-weary reporter with the newly purchased Washington Globe, helmed by Helen Mirren's very engaging take on Perry White/Katharine Graham. If you like thrillers you won't be disappointed in this pic that runs 2 hours and feels less than half of that. ""State of Play"" isn't perfect and the number of plot points that need to come together veritably dictate some implausibility at the end but if you compare this film to any five suspense-thrillers (at least Hollywood-made) that have come out in the past five years, you have to appreciate the whole package: Acting (and I disagree with the Ben Affleck naysayers here, he acquitted himself very well), character acting (Viola Thomas, Jason Batemen and Harry Lennix compete equally with a fraction of the time of the major players), interesting and gripping plot and story development, and overall believability all make this a first-rate film and one all involved should be proud of. The subtext of love and loss surrounding the non- entertainment print media also lends more than a little credibility and sympathy to the effort. I hope this film succeeds on a financial level and inspires at least one or two ambitious filmmakers to make movies in the same vein. Without doubt, there are too few genre pics of this caliber and State of Play shows it can be done well, even into the 21st century.",2009

5,"For those who saw the original BBC UK TV "" State of Play "" you will wonder how they could have made such a listless 2d version of a great plot line. Afleck is very good the best I've seen him act for years. Crowe is well, ordinary, his character, a grumpy, scruffy, almost unhygienic journalist is very one pace. The newspapers editor played by Helen Mirren is likewise played on one note , that of your tough mainly shouting Brit . The female sidekick of Crowes' is a token role inserted to try to involve the female viewer I guess , which is a shame as she wastes screen time which didn't allow what should have been the main female lead i.e. the wronged politicians wife to shine thru' as it did in the BBC version. In this adaptation her part was by passed with hints to an affair with Crowe, an unhappy marriage etc but absolutely nothing was fleshed out , so you cared little for her situation in all of this murder and intrigue. The at times slack pace of the movie was proved to me as the director constantly intercut scenes with those of a mysterious helicopter scanning the skies of Washington , a very amateur attempt at trying to create tension which isn't necessary in a truly thrilling movie and wasn't needed in the original The two glaring no-nos though were in plot lines which to me showed either lazy scriptwriting or masses of footage on the cutting room floor . In the hospital scene , where the female reporter bumps into the killer on the third floor as she emerges from the elevator. She proceeds to walk a few paces into the treatment room , within seconds a snipers rifle kills the would be witness. Now hang on , the same guy she has just passed has within ten paces of her walking, he has descended three floors, left the hospital , crossed the street , gone into another building, ascended at least four floors into a convenient room and fired his weapon to kill the guy , mmmmm OK suspend disbelief ( and time)",2009
7,"I had heard State of Play, from a number of critics, would be one of those movies that started out good, had a strong first half, and then started turning predictable and whatnot in the 2nd. Turns out it's not quite like that. State of Play is consistently good, has gripping parts and some very good performances, until it suddenly undoes its own highly cooked conspiracy-thriller intentions for one of those twist-endings that takes things back a notch. And it's not a good twist- not so much because of how the scene is written, the final confrontation between the characters, but because it deflates the rest of the paranoid drama and suspense that's been building up to it.",2009
10,"So I gave this movie a 10, but that's coming from a thriller fan. With most thrillers, this movie has it's faults. Some exaggeration, implausibilities, annoying twists, but the film transcends other thrillers on all other levels. Even with the overly dramatic plot and scenarios, I felt this film was a very realistic portrayal of journalism and posed an interesting argument between old fashioned print journalism and the new age of the internet. Of course, for the ""thrills"" they'll have to make some cliché twists, but it goes beyond the generic nonsense thriller to making a mild statement about the media today. In addition, the cast was fantastic. I couldn't be more relieved that Russell Crowe took over Brad Pitt's role, Pitt would have been a terrible choice. Russell was a much better fit for Cal. However, I kind of wish Edward Norton remained with the role of Senator Collins... Affleck and Crowe didn't have the greatest chemistry. However the many supporting players were fantastic. Rachel McAdams did a fine job. Not exactly the meatiest role but she played the revised role of Della as a young popular blogger greatly. Rachel brought that playful naivety but at the same time made Della intelligent and respectable. Helen Mirren was perfect, and perhaps a little underused. There is also a plethora of strong performances from the minor supporting players. Jason Bateman gave my favorite performance out of all of them, Harry Lennix was another who was underutilized, and Robin Wright Penn continues her reputation as one of the most consistent supporting actresses.",2009

9,"Character-wise, this movie doesn't have the complex figures of the best political thrillers. Dialogs are the brightest. Editing is great and the music's appropriate without being too prominent. But those are small quibbles when it comes to one of the most honest major features to come out in a long time. You'll hardly know where the facts end and where the fiction begins, because so much of it, barely obscured by a change of name, is real. As much a fiction this movie is, it may as well be a documentary.",2009
9,"Cal (Russell Crowe) and Stephen (Ben Affleck) have been buds since their college days. They still stay in touch, but their lives have taken two different paths. Stephen is an up-and-coming politico who has acquired the beautiful wife, Anne (Robin Wright Penn), the spiffy mansion, wealth and prestige. On the flip side, Cal works as a respected but hardly rich reporter for the Washington Globe, where publisher Cameron (Helen Mirren) reigns supreme. One day, as Stephen, who has been investigating the possibly nefarious doings of a Blackwater-type marines-for-hire group, is about to give a press conference, the gallery informs him that one of his committee members, Sonia, has been found dead near the DC subway. Beginning to cry, Stephen stumbles out of the press talk in a daze. That's because, it seems, red-haired, pretty Sonia was having an extra-marital thing with Stevie. Cal and fellow reporter, Della (Rachel McAdams) begin to investigate the case and also the death of two other gentlemen in the region whose demises may be connected. But, will the personal relationship and past that Cal has with both Stephen and Anne get in the way of the search for truth, especially when it comes to the billions of funds made by the ""hired guns"" Stephen was trying to explore? This is a top-notch thriller which may put fans of the genre into a state of euphoria. The script is flat-out terrific, based on a British miniseries, especially in its uncanny skill in blending a great deal of humor amid the chills and thrills. Likewise, the cast is most wonderful, with Crowe, McAdams, Affleck, Mirren, Jason Bateman, Jeff Daniels, Penn, and many others delivering strong, strong performances. Special words of praise should go to Crowe, for his head-turning but carefully nuanced role as a man caught in the middle. As for the movie's production, the sets, costumes, camera work and direction are nearly flawless, except for a ruffled blouse that some fashion diva thought would enhance McAdams' look but which hits 100 on the hideous meter. But, that's small peanuts, as they say. All in all, if you love thrillers, especially ones that include the juicy realms of politics and secret government operatives, you would be wise to head to the nearest theater and fork over some cash for this one. It is a definitely one fertile ""playground"" for the cinematic enthusiast.",2009
3,"State of Play is almost as bad as people say it is.After being led on a particular direction for some 110 minutes, we are suddenly thrown for a loop that reduces the tension of the story we thought we were watching to the tawdry dimensions of a sex scandal burdened by a overly zealous psycho-killer - ho hum.",2009

8,"State of Play is a good thriller that cleverly (whether intentionally or not) plays on a very strong view expectation. Everyone who goes to the movies knows that Hollywood always despises big business and usually despises the military and generally makes them the villain. When there is a murder and a big corporation is featured in the movie, the audience it automatically going make the connection. This makes the surprise ending quite effective because they are not behind the murders after all. The audience it genuinely surprised, and that doesn't happen too often.",2012
7,"Good thriller with some excellent performances. Russell Crowe is suitably grizzled as the been around reporter and Helen Mirren is wonderfully tough as his editor, the problem is the casting of Ben Affleck. He gives a good enough performance but is far too young to be believable as Crowe's college roommate or Robin Wright Penn's husband, not his fault but a major casting error nonetheless. Originally Crowe and Affleck's parts were to be filled by Brad Pitt and Edward Norton a far more simpatico pairing the obvious disparity in the leads ages distracts throughout the film. Jason Bateman shows up late in the movie to offer up a fun, out there performance as a sleaze. The story itself does move along and offers some nice tension and twists.",2013
5,"Sex and politics make a very explosive mixture indeed. This is a well made movie also but not only about that. But a well made movie is not always a good movie. And this movie could be a good one indeed if it had kept the same trend since the beginning I mean a movie about political corruption and the facing and fighting of the privatization of internal security in USA by a private corporation to win billions of dollars with such operation. This could be even presented like it began to be, mixed up with a thrilling murder story and the fight of a heroic journalist to discover the true behind it in order to save his friend the Congressman who presided over a commission charged precisely to investigate the above mentioned foul business. Such ingredients would make the story more attractive. But suddenly and unexpectedly the story changes abruptly its direction and turns the movie into a mere crime story just only passable. Pitiful indeed.",2009
6,"A remake of a British mini-series seems like a doubtful proposition,starting by the arrogant narrative decision of extirpating the story off London,to set it in Washington.What is more,the cast of solid character actors from the mini-series have been replaced by Hollywood stars who will undoubtedly attract more spectators,but at the same time,steal the atmosphere of anonymous intrigue.Having said that,I have to admit that the six hours from the mini-series were a little bit tiring to me,specially when the story turns its attention to the personal lives from the people who were involved on the political scandal.So,I had some hope that a certain grade of condensation in the story would result on a more interesting movie,with a better rhythm and enough deepness.In the film State of Play,co-screenwriters Tony Gilroy,Matthew Michael Carnahan and Billy Ray condensed the story,although they made it to loose some honesty and deepness.But now,I will stop comparing this movie to the original mini-series,and I will evaluate it by its own merits.And also using that judgment,I found State of Play to be a mediocre movie.On some aspects,this film tries to emulate the atmosphere from All the President's Men,with its combination of political intrigue and conflicts of conscience between reporters who have good intentions,but who have a doubtful ethic on their methods.I also detected some small tributes to the extraordinary JFK.However,the biggest influence from this movie is on the recent wave of similar political thrillers which denounce some aspects of the terrorism on the Middle East,or the war for the oil.But,in spite of its good intention,State of Play suffers from anachronism.It is true that the subjects which are examined on this movie will keep being relevant for years (maybe decades)...but they were more interesting to the general spectator five or six years ago (like when the original mini-series was released).Nowadays,with more urgent preoccupations in the global conscience,the lies from a North American company are less relevant than the virus which are floating on the air or the labour insecurity occasioned by the worldwide economical collapse.Movies should start to define new villains who are more appropriate for the worldwide situation (like in the movie The International),because if not,it will be difficult to wake up the spectator's imagination with tiring comments about a war whose revocation has expired,not on the real life,but on the short attention from the public opinion.It may not be fair to evaluate a movie for the historical context which rounds it,but I mentioned it because that was my perception when I was watching it.On the screenplay from this film,there are various elements which feel very forced.On State of Play,there are not any bad performances; everybody has an adequate development on their roles.But,I could not find passion on any of the actors...the only thing I saw on them was technique.I think that happened because director Kevin MacDonald's work lacks of energy and enthusiasm.I also feel this movie should have had more suspense,instead of a warm parade of scenes and situations which are connected by an old narrative formula (brave reporters looking for the truth),and not by the stimulating discovery of hidden connexions and scandalous secrets.In summary,there are too many coincidences,too many characters with a doubtful narrative value and too many redundant scenes which repeat what we already know...I think all this is a consequence to the previously mentioned condensation of the series.Instead of all my complains,I did not dislike State of Play.I cannot deny it kept me moderately entertained and that,near the ending,the film generates a good level of tension.But,the final experience I had with this movie was mediocre and completely forgettable.I think I can give a slight recommendation to this movie for the fact that it is not boring.",2009
1,"This movie was absolutely terrible. The movie dragged on with the plot barely moving for most of it and when it finally did begin to wrap things up it made ZERO sense. The guy who was the shooter at the beginning of the movie and turned out to be working for Ben Affleck's character? Who did he call right before he ground up his cell phone and put on his military uniform? Ben Affleck? If he did why would Ben Affleck have been stupid enough to still be in his office to get arrested? What ever happened to the majority Whip of Ben Affleck's party? Why didn't he get arrested? How was Ben Affleck behind everything if this guy helped set him up? That made no sense. Wasn't it awfully convenient for the killer of Ben Affleck's girlfriend and Ben Affleck (or whoever was behind the killing of Ben Affleck's girlfriend in the beginning) that she decided to stand in the ONE BLIND SPOT that the camera's had on the subway platform? STUPID, STUPID, STUPID MOVIE. Not bad acting, mind you, just a very, very bad plot full of holes. I want my time back as this movie's 127 minutes was a complete and utter waste of it.

The acting isn't particularly great, the camera-work and direction are rather dull and unstylistic, and I couldn't bring myself to care about the characters very much. Things just sort of happen without much emotional weight. Since this is a comedy, I could forgive the lacking aspects of the film if it was at least funny. Unfortunately the movie isn't really that funny. I had two or three involuntary grins and chuckles but nothing made me involuntarily burst out laughing. Even their Rush fandom is only shown as surface level; only popular songs like ""Tom Sawyer"" and ""Limelight"" are showcased (with a brief mention of ""Spirit of Radio"" somewhere in there) and I think it would have been more rewarding for viewers (who happen to be Rush fans) if they picked some lesser known songs. Not anything super obscure like ""Tai Shan"" or ""The Necromancer"", but how about something like ""Closer To The Heart"", ""Fly By Night"", or ""YYZ""? Sydney has a 2112 poster in his man cave but we never hear ""2112""! It also would have made sense for them to listen to some lesser known songs since Sydney is apparently a big enough fan that he bought a Geddy Lee Jazz Bass. A lot of people seem to love this movie and that's fine but I personally found it rather dull. Its not really worth checking out, even for Rush.",2017
10,"I normally wouldn't review a movie that wasn't just released on DVD or still in theaters, but I honestly couldn't believe there were negative reviews of this movie! How can you not like it!? In my opinion the only people who probably won't like this movie are those who are offended by cussing and sex talk (there's a lot. Less than ""The Hangover"" but more than ""Something about Mary"") or those who read WAAAAAY too much into things. I mean, TV and movies are not meant to be your moral compass in life. It's supposed to be funny and slightly over-the-top...it's a comedy, not a documentary. ",2011

9,"Curiously, the buzz surrounding the latest R rated adult comedy I Love You, Man is fairly superficial as many of the media eyes are on the clever creation of buzz word de jour 'bromance', meaning a platonic bond between two men in the spirit of a traditional romantic comedy. Now I don't know too much about all that, nor do I truly care. What I am concerned with however, and what I feel should be first and foremost on all accounts is how incredibly funny this movie really is.",2009
1,"The pretext is a cute idea. The future groom doesn't have a close friend who can be the best man. Also, his would-be bride's friends assert that he will be clingy and smothering without friends of his own. Unfortunately, that is where the good ideas end. The movie is rife with filthy language and behavior. Isn't there enough crudeness in the world? Yea, so I am a stick in the mud when it comes to this kind of humor. Cheap laughs. Lazy writing. Foul language, fart jokes, and characters debasing themselves in various ways. I say again. Lazy writing. None of this is creative. None of that is clever dialog. These aren't likable people. I would be embarrassed to have any of them as friends or family. So who cares about them? I sure didn't. I would much rather be a part of a nicer, more honest, kinder, and gentler world than the one portrayed here. LOL I guess I'll stay in Utah.",2009
1,"I don't know why I still hold out hope that movies like this will actually make me laugh or feel good. My wife really wanted to see this, but I was having doubts, after disliking similar ""comedies"" like ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" and ""Knocked up"". It was more awkward and painfully embarrassing than funny. I don't think I laughed once. Pretty much all of the characters ranged from bland and boring (Paul Rudd, his fiancé,) to enraging jerks (Jason Segal, John Favreau, who played the most vile, despicable character, ever. The one married to the annoying stick figure Jamie Pressley. I wanted to kill him.) Also, I own two dogs. Letting one's dog crap on a busy sidewalk or beach is NOT FUNNY. It should earn you a good beating. The wedding at the end was especially horrible. People don't act like that! Also, while I have nothing against gay people, the portrayal of the gay brother who tries to have sex with straight men (and succeeds?!?) is not funny, just really skeevy. Why this got so many favorable reviews is just wrong and sad.",2009
1,A truly awful film. ,2009
1,"This film is not funny at all, the acting is poor, the clichés piled on by the bucketful, pure Hollywood dross. I cannot understand why films like this get financed and promoted whilst other far more worthy films get overlooked. Paul Rudd is a poor actor, his character Peter Klaven is the typical Hollywood creation, of a man who is inept but somehow has an attractive woman on his arm etc. The film is uncomfortable to watch because it is so bad and it has absolutely no redeeming moments or scenes. I recommend you stay well clear of this film and find a proper comedy, preferably one which is not made in America, where the sense of humour is questionable at best.",2009
2,"I really just don't know why people like this movie so much. I typically really enjoy this genre (Anchorman, Knocked Up, etc.), but this just didn't work on any level. The friend I watched it with, who also loves pretty much any comedy, felt the same way. Throughout the entire movie, I failed to laugh once -- I only mildly chuckled a few times (rather forced chuckles at that). The movie somewhat held my interest for the first part when Paul Rudd is struggling to find a best friend, but as soon as he meets Jason Segal - when you think it will get good - it derails. The ending with the wedding was just plain brutal -- terrible writing, acting, etc. Yet, most people I talk to like this movie, which just blows my mind. I never thought I'd say this about a Paul Rudd movie.",2010
9,"I saw this film tonight at a movie theater in Scottsdale, AZ with an audience of 150-200 people, all of whom were laughing like crazy at this. While the overall plot is somewhat predictable, it doesn't matter because the jokes and dialogue, aren't. And more importantly, the jokes are FUNNY! Take your best bud AND you wife to see it... on separate showings. Paul Rudd plays a guy, madly in love with his woman, who relates better to women than men. He's never had a real ""guy"" friend, so with his fiancé's encouragement he goes on a series of ""man-dates"" to find a new friend, and best man. All the actors are terrific and it moves along at a brisk pace. What more can you ask for?",2009
1,"This is one of the least funny pieces of crap I have watched in a LONG time. I never post comments but I wanted to save people 90+ minutes of their lives. I rented at the Redbox for $1 and I want to get my money back! The jokes were not funny at all. The whole movie is just awkward and lame. We kept waiting for the movie to get funny, but it never did. The movie has to stoop to physical comedy (IE. puke and farts). I don't understand how people enjoy this unless they are intoxicated or under 15 years old. I'm amazed that people get paid big $$$ to write, green light,direct and produce this garbage. Don't waste your time and buy a Big Mac instead.",2009
7,Romantic comedies from a male perspective have worked very well in the past (I maintain that 'When Harry Met Sally' is such a movie and not a so called chick flick and 'High Fidelity' is as equally good) so the story of a man due to be wed but without a friend to call a Best Man did draw my interest.,2009
8,"Societal norms are a constantly evolving beast. Time was, most people got married at 23 or 24, had kids by 25, and that's just the way it was. These days, most of my friends aren't getting married until their early to mid thirties and even those that do often get divorced and re-married in their mid thirties. Fact is, we live longer, educate longer, and mature into family life slower. Another big change of the last few decades is how we work. My father's generation got a job out of high school or college and worked for the same company for 30+ years. Your friends were your coworkers and buddies from childhood. Often you spent your whole life surrounded by mostly the same people. Childhood buds were your buds for life, for better or worse. Nowadays of course 4 or 5 or even more major career changes is not uncommon, nor is at least 1 or 2 major geographic moves. All these changes have not gone unnoticed in Hollywood, where a cottage industry has sprung up of ""coming of age"" films for those tweeners in between young adult and middle age. Paul Rudd, Judd Apatow, Seth Rogan; these people have made careers out of catering to these new social landscapes. 'I love you, man' is another in a string of light-hearted comedies that find the humor in these situations.",2009
6,"Richard Kelly's latest supernatural thriller ""The Box"" is creepy, strange and overall sinister, yet not very coherent or focused. One's opinion on the movie depends on whether one accepts its peculiar concept or not. I must say that I was initially enthralled by the movie's strange old-fashioned tone resembling sci-fi movies from the 1970s Kelly pays homage to. The movie handles its mystery rather well with Frank Langella's uniquely scary performance being the obvious highlight. Given that, the movie falters at the end when its otherwise intriguing concept gets bogged down by the series of ridiculous events that feel as if they were taken from a different movie. While The Box tends to approach the wrong territory and is rather unfocused, one can't help but acknowledge Kelly's ability to attract the viewer's attention. His obsessions may not be shared by very many people, but he manifests them in a richly textured manner. That's just enough to enjoy this movie despite its shortcomings. 6.5/10 (B-)",2010
8,"After I heard how terrible this film was, I really wasn't expecting much. I almost didn't even rent it, but I am glad I did. I love Donnie Darko and I think with The Box, Kelly has gone back to the Darko style of writing and directing. I am not sure why it received so many bad reviews, maybe because like Donnie Darko it was too cerebral for the mainstream. It's not a movie you can do three things and watch, you have to pay attention to the little details. I do feel there are missing pieces that weren't explained, but that could be the way the film was edited and may come out later in a directors cut edition, or it could be Kelly's way of keeping the audience guessing. I can see how this movie wouldn't appeal to the masses, especially since it is a cautionary tale of morals and ethics, but if you liked Donnie Darko, you will probably enjoy The Box. I can see this having a cult following like Donnie Darko.",2010
5,"This movie starts off with a couple waken up by the doorbell early in the morning. The woman Norma Lewis ( Cameron Diaz ) opens the door just to find out no one's at the door. But there is a mysterious box on the doorstep, and Norma brings it in. In the meanwhile Arhur Lewis ( James Marsden ) joins her at the diner table and together they unfold the wrapping paper to find a box with a big red button on top of it. On the box is a keyhole which needs a key to open up the top so you can press the button. They have no idea what it is or what it means but that will soon change.",2010
8,"Forget about Donnie Darko. I open with this because it seems that a good portion of the reviews I have read on The Box amount to the simple but weak argument that it doesn't hold a candle to Darko. It isn't that I disagree with that necessarily, I just feel that this movie is a different animal altogether and deserves its own analysis. There are points of comparison to be sure, but they are peripheral concerns when you consider that the key to the heart of each movie is different. In Darko, the driving force of the narrative is existential. In The Box, the driving force of the narrative stems from a moral dilemma. Believe me when I say that I understand the inclination to compare an innovative filmmakers'movies by looking for trends and patterns, but for me it is more important to approach each new film as a self contained entity first, and then broaden my gaze afterwards. ",2009
7,"I'm not gonna lie. To say that this movie is confusing is like saying the sun is hot but not really. And if you've seen cult director Richard Kelly's previous films, ""Donnie Darko"" and ""Southland Tales,"" you know that's gotta mean something. When I went to see this movie, there were about 50 people in the theater. Before an hour into the film, about half of the audience had already walked out. By the end, there were only 15 people left wondering what in the hell did they just see. I for one could only comprehend roughly 40% of what I saw on- screen, and even then it can only be called interpretation. So why did I give this movie a generous seven stars? Because for one, we get some spectacular performances (Marsden's great and Langella returns as a familiar creepy character), and most importantly two, because it's entirely original and Richard Kelly, undoubtedly one of the bravest directors alive, uses his creative vision to tell a story that dares to be different. Quite frankly, it's the ONLY way - only through Kelly's unique style could this story be told the way it's intended.",2009
9,"I absolutely loved this movie. I can see why many people were turned off, especially if you go into it thinking you know how the movie will go. It was a pleasant surprise, and this movie kept me interested until the end. The plot was something new and fresh, and it unfolded at an excellent pace that mixed in drama and emotions. I actually felt for the characters, and I love the mystery and intrigue with the movie. Me and a friend saw this in theaters and were surprised as to how good it was. ",2012
1,"I know that so many reviews on IMDb are extreme, with reviewers either praising a film to the hilt or inarticulately tearing it to pieces. I find neither of these kind of reviews helpful, and so I do not give this film the awful review I am about to, lightly. The film is art-house science-fiction of the worst kind dressed up as a Hollywood blockbuster. The trailers draw you in by showing you what appears to be a cohesive plot, but is actually just a tiny part of a wilfully baffling series of events which are never properly resolved. I like films which challenge the viewer and I do not need to be spoon-fed a plot, and so my complaint against this film is not that it is too highbrow. No - the film is just terrible. As the credits roll you will feel genuine anger at having wasted your time on Cameron Diaz's wooden acting and a faltering plot-line. Avoid.",2010
6,"As a fan of science fiction allegory, social experiment, ""The Twilight Zone"" and the thriller genre -- no less all those elements combined -- Richard Kelly and his film ""The Box"" should've at least won me over, but it doesn't.

4,"In 1976 a mother named Norma Lewis (Cameron Diaz) lives with her son Walter and her husband Arthur (James Marsden).

By the late afternoon, a man with terrible scarring on his face comes to their door and presents Norma with an offer. This man is Arlington Steward (Frank Langella) and he announces that if they push the button someone in the world that the family does not know will die and they will receive a million dollars in cash. If they don't press it, nothing will happen and the offer will move on to someone else. Norma and Arthur are not allowed to tell anyone including their son about this deal. The incentive for the family to push the button is heightened by their financial difficulties.

One day a mysterious box appears with a red button. Later on that day a spooky gentleman shows up and tells them that they have the choice to press the button and receive a million dollars but someone they don't know will die. It's a disturbing and provocative question suspensefully outlined in the trailer and TV spots. But let it be known that you just don't know what your in for until you see it. At times pretentious and a bit melodramatic the film is ultimately effective because of it's good performances and intriguing subject matter. It would be unfair to ruin any of the plot twists for you but lets just say the film will deliver on the aspects you expect it to and not completely fulfill others it begins to outline. There's a lot of apparent symbolism and subtext in the film which is both interesting and annoying as it wasn't so evident in his other superior film Donnie Darko. There isn't too much more to say without ruining the film for you. it's meant to inspire lots of cafe chatter afterwards.

5,"Young buck auteur Richard Kelly has, since ""Donnie Darko,"" pined to be the Hitchcock of metaphysical sci-fi thrillers (a subgenre over which he holds dominion), which has led to a cult following in some circles, and migraine headaches in others. While not a terrible filmmaker by any stretch, Kelly--in a vein similar to Terry Gilliam--rarely knows when to apply the brakes to his craft. ""The Box,"" an ambitious effort backed by a major studio, fascinates and alienates in near-equal proportion. The director's stream-of-consciousness approach to imagery is seldom less than dazzling--there's nary a shot in ""The Box"" that isn't gorgeous, fake CG and all; on a purely superficial level, this is arguably the director's most visually arresting effort to date. As based on the short story 'Button, Button' by Richard Matheson, ""The Box"" is an egregious case of a director mismatched to his material (and Kelly is responsible for the adaptation, as well). While I have not read the story, I have enough familiarity with Matheson's work to know he deals in peeling the layers of sanity and safety away from seemingly banal topics, until fear and uncertainty are the only emotions that remain; matched with Kelly's bombastic narrative complications (NASA, conspiracy theories, trans-dimensional swimming pools...eh), this tale of a husband (James Marsden) and wife (a game--yet wasted--Cameron Diaz) who inherit the titular device that causes a murder only scrapes the surface of being a reflection on morality and sacrifice. A filmmaker like David Lynch (who, despite his excesses, knows a thing or two about subtlety and ambiguity) could have made a sparse, claustrophobic thriller around this theme, but Kelly brings things to a crashing halt in the last 30 minutes, with ridiculous dialog (Marsden's speech about the afterlife; Diaz's confession to Frank Langella's disfigured messenger) that confuses pathos with pretension, developments ripped from a bad '50s B-movie (that bell-ringing Santa), and a desperate attempt (yeah, just like ""Donnie Darko"") to clarify all the enigmas set forth prior. When is this guy going to just trust the material to carry itself without holding the audience's hand through answers he can't even adequately explain? A little ambiguity goes a long way, and could have transformed ""The Box"" into a great thriller instead of a frustratingly wasteful night at the movies.",2010

It feels like someone got excited about a one-line idea and went straight into production before the script had a chance to take shape. Payoffs are few and far between. The script is as clunky as a supermarket trolley. The sub plots are deadends. And the cast... well, poor ol' Cameron tried hard but she didn't have much material to work with. And the extras? Wow - they really were something out of the box. They wouldn't have looked out of place in a late 1960's B-grade telemovie about the Village of the Feeble Minded (And Badly Acted) but in a full ticket price movie? Nahhh. They really dragged what little plausibility this movie had way down below the critical threshold of believability, and in some instances almost imposed an unwanted comedic tone into what should have been some serious moments (you'll see what I mean if you decide to see this film!). The Box is not worth seeing unless you are faced with a binary forced choice between this film and an anaesthetic-free dental appointment. It's weak. It's laboured. It's boring. And kinda' silly.

The scenes conveying the near-extinction of the human race and how the vampires are taking over and how the vampires themselves are threatened by the blood shortage issue was done rather effectively and the audience seemed to love it. There is a sense of foreboding throughout the film which can be expected in the genre, but nevertheless is very vital to it as most films fall short here. Daybreakers is not your typical cliché-ridden vampire horror. There has obviously been some sensible writing involved here.

This topsy-turvy ""new normal"" is sharply and amusingly depicted as being eerily similar to current living with the important difference that the populace go about their business at night and enjoy shots of blood in their coffee.

Thus any and all humans are captured and farmed for blood until the day they die. We have found a way to do these things and maintain the semblance of our day-to-day.

Their power and numbers become so vast that humans quickly go to the minority, hunted as cattle to use for sustenance and harvested for blood. Mankind has become extinct and although the government and scientists are working around the clock for a synthetic substitute, vampires are dying left and right. But before they do, the starvation process mutates them into winged creatures with pointy ears and shriveled skin, resembling those creatures of the dark we might have seen years ago; definitely not the refined ones as in ""True Blood"". I shouldn't use that comparison too much, however, as these vamps, while intelligent creatures ""living and breathing"" with the only difference from humans being their need for blood and fear of the sun, are more hybrids with the legends Hollywood has created. For example, early on we see our lead Hematologist, played by Ethan Hawke, mysteriously absent from his car's sideview mirror, a myth not true in the HBO series.",2009
7,Ten years after a plague has turned most of the human race in to vampires hematologist Edward Dalton works for a corporate company that sells human blood .

8,"You'd think that after 80 years of vampire movies there's little 'fresh blood' to be added to the genre, but Daybreakers proved such pessimist thinking wrong. Containing one of the most intriguing premises I've ever come across, this film puts a wholly different spin on the notion of the undead thriving on the blood of their human victims. In the not too distant future, a viral outbreak has turned most of the world population into vampires, while regular human beings have become quite the endangered species. Since the vamps need human blood to survive while they are as immortal as usual, blood shortages are increasingly threatening the societal status quo (which remains remarkably human in appearance). A hematologist (Ethan Hawke) works tirelessly on a synthetic blood substitute, experiments which continue to fail, partially because the CEO of the company that controls the 'real deal' (a deliciously sinister Sam Neill) is rather keen to keep making the big bucks off rich vampires that can afford genuine blood. Vampires or not, money is still the driving factor behind it all, to the detriment of civilization. The situation is getting ever more untenable as poorer vampires are so desperate they start feeding on each other or even on themselves, causing them to mutate into crazed bat people (a funny take on the ever present relationship between vampires and bats, which otherwise plays no significant part in this film); freaks that are brutally exterminated by the authorities. Hawke's sympathetic scientist, made vampire by his brother against his will, proves a guilt ridden person determined to change this upside down world for the better and sympathizes with what few humans remain free, continuously hunted by the vampire military as they are. After aiding a group of humans evade capture, he is contacted by an underground resistance movement, led by ex-vampire Willem Dafoe, that aims to develop a cure for vampirism, the only viable way for both humans and vampires to survive their impending doom. Hawke accepts their invitation and joins their cause, which soon pits him and the rebels against Neill's profit driven tyranny.",2013

3,"I had a chance to hear Tucker Max talk about the movie at a screening and he seemed quite confident that it would surpass Wedding Crashers as the highest grossing comedy of all time. After seeing the movie, it became quite clear that he was completely delusional. The movie has poor dialogue, a poor plot, and mediocre acting. I spent a little while trying to think of a redeeming quality, or any basis upon which I could recommend the movie to other people. I came up empty-handed. ",2009

1,"This movie was absolutely hysterical. Remember when Alan accidentally gave his friends roofies thinking it was Ecstasyoh Sorry about that, I was accidentally reviewing ""The Hangover,"" which is what ""I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell"" is without the funny, wit, good writing, and personality. I want to do a compliment sandwich with this movie, but the reality is that I cannot give any because there's none to give. So I'll just get into it: This movie is bad. Not offensive bad. Let me repeat: NOT OFFENSIVE BAD. Bad bad. This is the Battlestar Gallactica of comedy. The plot is hackneyed and worn out and executed poorly. The characters are so boring and mundane. There's no character development. There are attempts at it, but it falls flatter than William Hung's face. Remember that William Hung reference folks, because it's as obscure and obsolete as the jokes in the movie.",2009
1,"What were they thinking? This film was basically a ripoff from ""The Hangover"" and loosely from all those other 'men sowing oats before wedding' flicks. I understood the premise and accept it. Sometimes you eat the lion and sometimes the lion eats you. This time , I was eaten. This film was horrible . Tucker, our main character was an obnoxious fool, but what is worse, he is an unfunny, obnoxious fool. The same old recycled gags; Bathroom sounds,handicap humor, fecal matter, misogyny etc. Where as ""The Hangover"" was excellent and yes even tastefully done with funny, original material. This film was not. As the film progressed toward its conclusion, Tucker was supposedly redeemed, but he was still an obnoxious clod that one could not root. Basically, He is Ferris Bueller raised by outlaws. Somehow, he convinces his friends to go to a town 3 hrs away to visit a special strip joint. Of course , one of these suckers is the groom. I do not want to give away the whole film, only suffice to say Tucker was not a good friend or even human being for that matter. Blaise acting performances, bad direction and the worst humor, translate to an absolutely awful rating and even worse viewing experience.The only good thing I can say is that I did not pay for this; Although time being money, I wasted an hour and half of my life.",2010

1,"I watched the movie because a friend of a friend knows Tucker. I could have shot this person in the head after having watched this. Thank God I didn't pay to watch it. There is a reason the movie was not nominated for Oscars or only grossed a little over 1 mil....it sucks. The funnier part was when I actually googled the making of the movie and I've never seen someone referred to as a ""douchebag"" so many times in my life. I have to wonder though how some guy that looks and acts like he just rolled out of bed thinks he knows how to become a screenwriter after reading books for 6 months. That's even funnier and well, explains a lot. If he's the best technical writer this man (tucker) knows, I won't even attempt to read HIS books. Poor advertising or marketing?? How about poor writing, producing, directing, and movie in general...",2010
2,"I read somewhere that the writer of the screenplay of this movie (and author of the book on which it was based) claimed that this film was going to be better than ""The Hangover."" That made me laugh more than any part of this movie did! WOW, this was a genuinely non-funny movie. When I first began watching this film, I had missed the opening credits, and title even, so after 20 or so minutes, I had assumed a slasher was about to start picking the characters off, one by one. When I finally realized that wasn't going to happen, I thought ""where the hell is this going, and when am I going to want to laugh at SOMEthing??"" I never did. I only found out after viewing the entire thing that it was based on a book by the same name, and that apparently the book was a big hit. It must have been a big hit with GUYS only, that's for sure; and guys with very low standards and misogynistic / toilet humor. ",2010

Let's not forget the ""poor"" lighting, I've never been to a bar or strip club that is lit up with bright lights. Yes this movie is similar to The Hangover but is based on a book that was written a couple years ago. I watched this movie with my friend On Demand on a Tuesday and Wednesday morning I went out just to buy it. I would recommend this movie to anyone who watches movies for the enjoyment, not the lighting and likable character. It's just a good, dirty time.",2010
3,"I was compelled to make an account on this site to write a review after reading the three most recent reviews for I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell. Those three reviews were far more amusing than the movie itself. If they were fake (as I suspect)...nice. If they were genuine reviews...what is wrong with you? I'm not going to write an extensive, piece-by-piece review of this movie, because this is all you need to know: It really isn't funny. When I saw the movie, there were perhaps ten people in the theater. I do not recall hearing a single laugh from anyone. I was sincerely amused only once; I mostly just forced chuckles at things that I recognized from Tucker's book and web site--things that were infinitely more funny to read about than to see on screen. For whatever reason, Tucker's stories just do not translate well to film (or he did a very poor job of translating them to film). My one friend who came with me to the movie said, ""It wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be."" I would be embarrassed recommending this film to anyone. I still think Tucker's web site and book are pretty funny, but if you want to be entertained, don't bother with the movie version of I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell.",2009
7,"Overall, I enjoyed this movie. I have read the book and have been a fan for quite a while now, and when I heard there would be a film I was very excited. That being said, I'm going to do the ultimate evil of comparing the movie to the book. I thought Dan's character was spot on and well drawn, while Drew's attitude may have been a little extreme, and Tucker just seemed slightly ""off"" somehow but overall a good representation. Some of their antics were quite hilarious, but the main problem I had with this movie was that so many lines were quoted directly from the book (and sometimes out of context), so I already knew exactly what the guys were going to say. I think if they hadn't tried so hard to stick to the exact wording some of the dialog could have been improved or expanded upon. It was a fun ride though, and Tucker even ended up learning a thing or two, which I'm not sure I can say for his book counterpart! If I was the director I would have spent more time telling other stories from the book to help establish the characters, and then move into a condensed version of the film as it is for the second half. If that had been the case, I probably would have given it 9 out of 10. People who haven't read the book probably feel thrust in the middle of something they don't quite understand, and may not want to understand. I feel that it was a good movie, and very funny, but with a slightly different approach it could have been an awesome movie.",2010

8,"I really enjoyed this movie. Even though it's a ""guy"" movie I still laughed throughout. I have no earthly idea how it only has 4 stars...which makes me think I really can't trust the overall average ratings on IMDb. I really thought it was a honestly good script. The story was pretty good, although I can see where people are saying it was like the hangover -- but what I don't agree with is when they said it wasn't funny. I didn't realize that is where the story was going (the hangover) while the movie was on until I read these reviews. If the stories are true from his book though, who is copying who? I don't understand all of the hate votes here, but I would like everyone to know this is honestly an incredibly funny comedy.",2010
3,"I'm not sure if it was tamed down from the book to prevent an NC-17 rating, or to create scenes that mirrored the successful formula for college/bachelor party films (Hangover, Road Trip, Crashers) but I read the book and this movie contains maybe 10% of its content. It really just focused on one road trip, no Miami restaurants, no Texas ranch & crazy dog, no California job fiasco, no mention of the famous Tucker Max death mix, much of the film was new material. IHTSBIH was actually an amalgam of previous films of this genre. I suppose the misogynist-but hilarious rapid fire bar scene dialog between Tucker and the ladies did contain text taken from certain passages, but I didn't see the book as one story, much less Tuckers. Although the acting is quite good and energetic, essentially the film fails because of that reason. It is all over the place. The Visine story was NOT in the book and ripped right from WC. Clearly this movie was cut in post production by nervous editors attempting to follow the footsteps of previous hits, consequently it lost all its original freshness & originality. Big disappointment.",2010
3,"""Brilliant, smart, funny and great writing with appealing characters"" are not anyway to describe this colossal flop of a film. How could anyone screw up what could have been such a good movie, after all his book was a ""New York Times Best Seller"". I read the book and was slightly more than pleased of what I had read, all while thinking ""what a great movie this could be"" and ""maybe if a movie comes out, it may end up being one of those extremely popular, high grossing cult films that every college kid has in their DVD collection!"" Pleased, the movie comes out and I have a beer in hand and ready to watch what could be the best comedy ever. WRONG! This movie was loosely based on the book, and I use the term ""loosely"", loosely. I found myself yelling at the TV ""when the heck did that happen in the book?"" Tucker. Listen up. If you are going to try making a movie titled the same as your hugely successful book, why not try using some elements from it. I am not surprised Tucker Max spent 7 or so million dollars making this movie and it didn't even make 2 million on the big screen. I don't think it's enough of a loss. Maybe after giving Tucker that much deserved punch in the scrotum I will calm down and feel better about hour that hour and forty-five minutes that I'll never get back.",2010
3,"Not a comedy - nothing like how it is sold by the trailer. Nothing like 'The Wedding Crashers' or 'The hangover'. Not a chance in hell of repeating their success. If the movie character Tucker Max is a reflection of the author then he really should get into therapy - not funny, nor a good writer. Read some comments about good dialogue - absolutely not - sub, sub, sub kevin smith, even more sub-level Tarantino. Not even the type of dialogue that you wish yo';d said, it's just not good. The author seems to think that portraying himself as an ahole pushes the envelope and displays something or other - not so - this was achieved so much better by Campbell Scott in Roger the Dodger. The problem with this movie is - it's just not that good - derivative without adding anything, an anemic copy of much better movies. In fact the only relatively decent scene's are when the Tucker character is off the screen. This isn't so bad it's good - it comes across as a waste of time and talent. the vote of 3 is for the actors (not the one playing Tucker) who are pretty good (and badly served by mediocre scripting).",2010
7,"As a big fan of Tucker Max's bestseller of the same name, I decided to throw caution (a 4.8 rating on IMDb) to the wind and went to see the movie adaptation of I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell this afternoon. I figured that the movie probably was not as bad as people were saying, and that the rating on that site was probably inaccurate between the many Tucker haters/fanboys who voted (which is definitely the case, over 50% of the votes on that site are either a 1 or a 10).",2009
8,"Used to be a loyal follower of IMDb ratings, this is the title that makes me think twice about trusting popular vote. I don not understand where the angry ratings of ones come from. I've laughed and enjoyed myself watching it, and from what I see, the movie is also certainly not moral-less or meaningless. I've not read the novel to say if the movie is a good reflection of the novel. But it's certainly worth watching. Contrary to the angry reviewers, very subjectively, at least an 8 out of 10! (I was tempted to give it a 10 to offset the bad ratings, yet I decided not to.) I'm running of things to say to fulfill the 10 lines review requirement...just wanted to keep it relatively short and perspective.",2010
9,"I went into this movie having no idea who Tucker Max is, or having any idea what the movie was about, and what I got was a great surprise. I'm not a huge fan of ""The Hangover"" but I thought it was definitely enjoyable. I Hope They Serve Beer In Hell takes the basic hangover idea but tones it down to a realistic, but that much more satisfying level. I can see myself and my friends in each of the characters, so it was very easy to relate to.",2010
7,"To start off, this is not the next masterpiece of the year, although I bet none of us is expecting it to be. All I can do, is to be fair with you and simply state that this movie left me with a smile on my face. The movie takes a slightly more serious approach than your typical ""American Pie- like"" movies, and actually makes quite some sense. Yes, it tends to be over the top some times, but it is really just a good portrayal of the different characters most group of friends have and the way they react under different circumstances. The movie did not contain any weird plot- holes that seriously bother me, and I think its creators did a good job on walking the fine line between absurdity and familiarity to make a believable entertaining movie, with more depth than one would actually expect.",2010

Stargate Universe is a drama about a group of individuals who are trapped on a ship half way across the known universe. The idea behind this show is that the people on the ship are attempting, to the best of their own personal abilities, to find a way for day-to-day survival and how to gain control of this massive intergalactic spaceship.

Why is the ship smart enough to know how to defend itself, when to stop and fix itself, but not smart enough to interact with it's occupants? It's supposed to be fantastically advanced computer technology after all, where's the AI? Why does a ship that can FLY THROUGH A STAR to replenish it's power need to turn the lights off to conserve energy? How does a ship that can FLY THROUGH A STAR get damaged and holes cut in it by tiny alien ships full of blue fish men? This ship has been traveling for a million years or hundreds of thousands of years (it seems to change form episode to episode) so why the hard time limit for stops? I mean it's supposedly stopping because something they need that is on a nearby planet but it always, sadistically gives them barely enough time to get whatever it is that the ship stopped so they could get. Let's be honest BSG did very well and this is a ripoff of it to the point that the producers and writes just don't care about all of the inconsistencies.

I believe it is a worthy successor and I am looking forward to next week and I hope the intensity that was shown this week is maintained.

2,"After watching the pilot episode of SGU, I can now recommend the newest  installment of the once-beloved Stargate series to all the insomniacs  out there. SGU was a mash of Battlestar Galactica and Days of Our  Lives.  New direction? More like lack of direction. Good camera-work? Closer to  vomit-inducing cameraJERK. The story moved along at a snails' pace,  with no subtle or intricate plot developments to make up for it.  Lengthy dialogues ensued throughout the show only when characters were  hurt for no apparent reason. Quite a few scenes were a complete waste  of alloted air time; such as the sex scene between one  barely-introduced character and another unknown character. In a  scenario where teleportation beams are a part of life, logic entails  that the brain of the operations (Dr. Rush) wouldn't treat a mundane  flying camera as if it were completely foreign and marvelous. The  characters' efforts throughout the show amount to nothing in the end,  as everything could be solved if anyone amongst the brilliant team of  SG personnel would think to dial back to Earth. But perhaps the extras  are simply playing themselves, as half of the supposed 'personnel' that  walk through the stargate are dressed like civilians. Where were the  costume designers?  Universe's predecessor, Atlantis, had a far better cast of likable  characters. Strong, smart and talented characters were dropped from the  air so that non-relatable characters could take their place. The  Senator was so annoying and useless throughout the show that when he  sacrificed himself, you couldn't help but feel a wash of relief. The  Senator's daughter did a great job of taking on the role of 'annoying  character of SGU' when he died, as a whole 15 minutes of airtime was  devoted to watching her cry and mourn over a character with no  reputation with the audience. Dr. Rush was presented as more of a  villainous weasel than a genius who imbues the show with a sense of  authenticity -- as SG:1 and Atlantis both had.  Where there was once a quality franchise with a 10-year reputation,  there now stands a truly awful show with complete disregard to longtime  fans of SG, or anyone with eyes, ears and a brain for that matter.",2009

It made no sense whatsoever."". Not this. However, in order to understand everything you must really pay attention to all the details, some lines, some specific shots and then I promise, it will all make sense. Of course, if you have someone to discuss it with after it is over, will make things a lot more interesting and engaging.

You are really pushed to pay close attention to all details in the movie, otherwise you can miss the ""real"" point in the story.

8,"TRIANGLE for me is a terrific time loop scifi horror set aboard a marauding art deco luxury liner. And as much as I detest Friday 13TH and its kind I found TRIANGLE to be a compelling and shocking and utterly mesmerizing experience. The whole idea of the time-shifting and the unbreakable cycle and how the events layer upon each other, different angles of witness, assisting the friends who are doomed anyway, the scary deserted luxury liner, and the horror of her treatment of her son...all add up to a very clever and ingenious Australian made thriller. If you combine GROUNDHOG DAY with GHOST SHIP you will get an idea of the construct. TRIANGLE has a terrific CGI storm, some creepy Oceanliner imagery and delivers some real jump shocks. I am amazed at the bad reviews and am very disappointed if this film does not reach its audience. BUT here in Sydney it is released on one screen with the most stupid advertising imaginable: an axe murderer stalking Melissa George. Wow if a film's marketing imagery could be more off putting I have yet to see it this side of HOSTEL 2 and any Friday THIRTEENTH junk which TRIANGLE certainly is not. Fortunately I took a chance suspecting TRIANGLE might just be better than its ad sell and I was right. Go see TRIANGLE and ignore the bad reviews and the stupid ads and posters.",2010

Just loved it...thank god to youtube where i saw its trailer randomly and the trailer did all justice to the movie and created all the curiosity which one needed... Where do i start coz its a traingle...one without end or beginning...you will get to know this when you will see the movie..;) the concept is amazing and hats off to the writers for that...then comes the more important part...amazing amazing amazing direction... starting 23 mins or soo are the prologue...once the character are defined and we are through with them the pace just raised exponentially... every time the the loop is repeated we kind of think that thats going to happen and start to guess but constantly a new element is added which forces us to guess for the next loop that now am sure this is what which is going to happen...but wait...the writers have enough in their mind...we just can't guess... Brilliant.. The movie is soo well written and soo well paced that you will not get a single second to get distracted....Plus the ending is the cherry on the top.... Am now you fan Mr Christopher Smith...there is something with the name Christopher...both Nolan and Smith make the movie which just plays with you mind and make your jaws open... As far as acting is concerned Melissa George has performed that brilliantly that i can't think of any actress which could have done better...apart form her other characters were also great but they were not given that much of the exposure... I will personally recommend to all guys out there who love to play with there mind while watching movie and appreciated movies like inception,saw,Prestige etc...",2012

9,"Structured like a labyrinthine video game. Packed with loads of paranoid suspense and style. Tuned with the hazy thick atmosphere of a bad dream. A diabolical guessing game from scene to scene. Triangle is one of the most enjoyable mind benders out there, a funhouse of a thriller that sails into murky metaphysical water and doesn't let either it's protagonist or its audience off with a cheap resolution. Imagine Dead Calm crossed with Memento and you'll begin to have some notion as to where this film will take you. It's a freaky voyage, as star Melissa George finds out after a yachting expedition with friends hits a nasty patch of storm weather. Soon a massive, deserted ocean liner crosses their path, and they are forced to board it after the typhoon wreaks their smaller craft. The rest of her crew just seemed puzzled by the derelict vessel, but Melissa has an eerie, gnawing feeling that she's been on this boat before, a feeling that something is very wrong. Suddenly there's a mystery person hunting and killing them, and if I just made it sound like a run of the mill slasher flick, please be assured that it's anything but. What I've described happens in what is maybe the first quarter of the film, and everything after that point is a trip into a dizzy, seafaring twilight zone of psychological mystery and reality warping uncertainty that makes George unsure if anything, including her own perception of reality, can be trusted. Events repeat themselves, characters dart in and out of the wormhole of a narrative arbitrarily yet with a hidden purpouse that managed to scarily elude me for much of the film. It's scary in the way that ducks usual horror trends. There's violence and even some ghastly gore, but the real fear here lies in the unknown, the idea that forces beyond what we perceive as reality are messing around with us, and indeed they do mess around with her and then some, right up until the last frame of an ending that's commendable, haunting and difficult to process. George makes great work of the confusion that morphs into terror and then outright existential panic, keeping us on our toes with the way she handles her character arc. Keep an eye out for a young Liam Hemsworth too. For psychological thrillers, it don't get much better than this, and it's off the radar enough that you'll be able to recommend it to your friends who chances are, haven't even heard of it.",2016

And the ""mystery"" also made no sense, I couldn't concentrate on the movie because I was trying to understand the story, but I just couldn't. I felt that the writer of this story wrote it when he was drunk or so, or maybe a monkey wrote this movie. It would make better sense why the storyline was awful. Please, anyone who didn't watch this movie, DON'T watch this movie even with all of those high ratings. I can't understand why they actually gave this a high rating. Out of pity maybe?",2010

Dedicated Famous Five fans will miss Timmy the dog as he demanded to be written out of the script after controversially describing the plot as ""moronic"".

1,"The implausibility of the plot has been noted by several commentators, particularly the immense amount of trouble Fr McKenna would have had to have gone to, and the sheer impossibility of some of the calculations he would have had to have made, including that Langdon was going to decipher each clue in minutes. McKenna is branded; a few seconds later he is giving orders, and a few minutes later, he is running (literally) around in charge of operations -- in real life, he would be in shock. And, as usual in thrillers, the assassin doesn't kill the heroes, giving as his only lame explanation that they were not on the list of those to be killed, as though every other innocent bystander he shot was. I have always used Independence Day as the hallmark of a truly awful film (US President commandeers jet plane and beats off aliens, ha ha), and this effort runs it close. For such an implausible film, Angels and Demons contains a remarkable number of predictable incidents. Who didn't laugh knowingly when the assassin went to get his reward in the Volkswagen? I felt like shouting, ""You are going to be blown up"". Who didn't know that the heroine was going to find a body in the lab? Who didn't spot the baddie? Technically also, the film was awful. The dialogue was more often indecipherable than clear, while the races across Rome to the next church were accompanied by deafening music. Moreover, many scenes looked like mud. The one redeeming feature was the shots of Rome and what looked like the Vatican -- an achievement, because I am sure that the Vatican officials would not have wanted this dross shot in and around St Peter's -- and the interiors were convincing. Rome is a magic place, and I enjoyed seeing it fleetingly.",2009
7,"Tom Hanks returns as Dan Brown's symbologist Robert Langdon in his first adventure Angels & Demons, which Hollywood decided to make after The Da Vinci Code, given the latter's more controversial subject striking a raw nerve on the faith itself. The Catholic Church was up in arms over the first film, but seemingly nonchalant about this one. And it's not hard to see why, considering Ron Howard had opted to do a flat-out action piece that serves as a great tourism video of Rome and Vatican City, and would probably boost visitor numbers given the many beautiful on-location scenes, save for St Peter's Square and Basilica which was a scaled model used.",2009
4,"Why did they not follow the book ... I am really sad and disappointed. I was so looking forward to seeing this movie, however, if you have read the book (maybe recently) it might be very difficult to remain objective. My wife had not read the book, and she loved the movie.",2009
1,"Adaptation of Dan Brown's bestseller, a follow-up to 2006's ""The Da Vinci Code"", has so much plot exposition, location trotting, CGI effects and elaborate camera set-ups in the first thirty minutes, one is apt to be blown away or perhaps toppled over by the breathless racing about. Tom Hanks returns as Robert Langdon, author and professor of religious symbols and societies, who is called upon by the Commander of the Vatican in Rome after a precious vial of anti-matter is violently stolen from a top secret lab in Geneva (which we see) and four Cardinals--candidates for the late Pope's empty chair--are kidnapped (which we don't see). Seems an underground sect named the Illuminati is behind the dirty deeds, and they plan on killing one Cardinal every hour until the stroke of twelve when the contents of the vial will destroy Rome. Extremely slick, extremely familiar jigsaw puzzle movie with absolutely no mystery--just Tom Hanks rattling off information before rushing from Point A to Point B. The killings smack of ""Se7vn"", while the ensuing relationship between Hanks and brilliant scientist Ayelet Zurer is delineated for us in cartoonish terms. Ron Howard also returns as director, and one can almost sense his desire to flood the narrative with jargon (and the screen with slapdash movement) so that the gaps of credibility and logic won't show through. ""Angels & Demons"" has a highbrow air about it which causes some viewers to think they're seeing something powerful and important, but don't be fooled. It is an expensive picture, burnished and foreboding, however it's about as intrinsically satisfying as junk food--and just as bad for you. NO STARS from ****",2010
4,"I went to see this movie tonight, trying to keep an open mind. I had hoped to enjoy a movie that I expected to be different from the book. There were considerable differences from the book, much like the changes made in the DiVinci Code. I went to see the DiVinci Code with the same thought process and managed to enjoy the film, in spite of, the changes from the book. It was still enjoyable, filled with action, and the process of deciphering the symbols was interesting and mentally stimulating. Unfortunately, Angels and Demons disappointed on almost every level. Throughout the movie, symbols are found and figured out quickly, without any interest for the viewer. They blow past the various Immuminati symbols so quickly that we had no chance to get a look at them and appreciate how they work. The final Illuminati symbol, which was the most interesting and creative one in the book, was replaced with the crossed keys symbol. In my opinion, that was a missed opportunity to focus on and spend a little more time on the symbols, which is what the Langdon character is all about. Overall, this movie is a very poor interpretation of the book, and fails at the attempt to be an action movie / thriller. 4 out of 10",2009

Get it? OK, and the sexy scientist Vittoria Vetra is the expert who knows how to manage the bomb they're threatening the Vatican with.

Given the excellent story, the result could have been better though. The movie is pretty long but at the end I was feeling like some things were missing. Sound effects and sound tracks were very good. Acting was well done but the character development phase was very weak. For people who didn't read the book, things may look happening too quickly. From my point of view, instead of trying to put as much as stuff from the book, they could have tried to do the important scenes more proper. What makes the book very good was all the puzzle like story combined with the excellent portrait of Vatican. You see neither of it in the movie. Too much rush and using the time not in a good way, these are main problems of the movie. So, it is worth watching but could have been done better.",2009

Anyone who enjoyed the novel will be disheartened by all the changes that make the movie confusing rather intriguing.

The head of the scientific research center, who was a major character in the book, is completely eliminated. The British writer and camera person are not in the movie at all and I don't recall them mentioning the relationship between the female star and the murdered scientist who had 2 careers that seemed to be at odds but are a major reason for his anti - matter research.

Here the score is iffy and scarce and the story, translated into musical numbers is kind of shallow and, quite honestly, not enough. There are, however, moments to enjoy. The look of it is great, and Marion Cotillard makes something enormous from the little she was given. Penelope Cruz dances an erotic dance and Kate Hudson, well I don't quite know what she was doing. Nicole Kidman is starting to look like a wax work, what a pity! And Judi Dench is always fun. I was reminded she was a sublime Sally Bowles in the first London production of ""Cabaret"" - Daniel Day Lewis has been one of my favourites for a long time now but here he is far too pale, inside and out.

1,"Lots of money spent giving incredibly beautiful visuals with some extraordinary performances by a stellar cast, in this monotonous dull and lifeless movie. What a shame. The cast obviously poured their hearts out, and worked their asses off. The production design and cinematography are award worthy. The directing is absolutely horrendous. Atrocious. Horrible. Hey Rob, where you put the camera is really important. I couldn't see inside any of these characters! I never felt sympathetic, empathetic, or even slightly connected to any of these characters. Sad, cause the actors brought it. The movie never showed it to the audience. When Guido (Daniel Day-Lewis) kneels at his Mother's (Sophia Loren) feet and admits his faults, we see his hair back-lit. I will bet had the camera actually looked into his eyes we might have had something there. One hour and forty five minutes into the movie, the conflict with the wife happened. Finally some real drama. Had that been the first scene I might have decided to care about this man's journey. Kate Hudson's number was the highlight of the film, although completely disconnected from the story. But then again, everything is disconnected. And there really is no story. And making a film with an Italian sensibility in the English language is probably an impossibility. Remember when they dubbed ""La Vita e Bella"" into English? That, like Fellini's work was beautiful in Italian. It sucked in English. I say, leave the making of Italian films to Italian filmmakers. Uhhhgggg.

It's a silly and presumptuous musical that makes you leave the movie theater feeling ashamed. Why did Kate Hudson say ""yes"" to this part? She's totally out of context here, she doesn't even know what she's doing. Her musical performance is pitiful and I almost prayed it ended as quick as it could. As for the songs... all awful. ""Cinema Italiano"" makes you feel you're being stabbed in the ears. In general, all songs are bad, except for the one that's sung by Luisa.

Each character is basically given one song and possibly part of a second which all show a deep emotion. The actresses all created fully drawn characters with histories and emotional depth, but we as the audience don't see the development of any character except Guido which is unusual. I don't see that as a bad thing however I believe some will. ",2009
1,"This film was most definitely the largest waste of time and money I have experienced recently. The acting was so narrow and stereotyped that any ideas presented within this film have been seen so often even the cliché's are boring, luckily I had enough sleep the night before or I would have slept through the entire thing. As I am often finding with movies with a long list of well known stars the actual content is meaningless drivel. This is most definitely true of this film. Also the separate but not separate stories of the woman who influence his life are not even remotely interesting, the muse, the angry wife, the desperate mistress, the childhood whore, the seductive blonde strumpet, the close female friend/mother figure and the actual mother are all things that have played out a million times before not to mention a cheating Italion husband? Stereotype central is the basis of this movie. As I watched I kept expecting something exciting or even interesting to happen but no I was sorely disappointed. Essentially this film is about a man who tries to make a movie fails because of his miserable reality and then finds himself the only lovely thing in the film was the costuming and cinematography... if you are looking for a film with some mediocre singing, some boring and ultimately meaningless plot, as well as some great actors performing below their normal standard then feel free to see Nine - this is the movie for you!",2010
9,I'd like to express my gratitude to Rob Marshall for finding a way to cinematize at least two classic Broadway musicals. I find myself hoping that the seemingly arbitrary dismissals by some critics and users of both Chicago and Nine (not to mention poor box office returns and perhaps low DVD sales and rentals) will not discourage Marshall from reaching for yet another musical. How about Sondheim's Follies? Please.,2010

6,"In one of the most anticipated films of the Oscar season, Rob Marshall directs the adaptation of the Broadway musical, Nine. The film stars a studded-cast of A-list celebrities including Academy Award Winners Daniel Day-Lewis, Marion Cotillard, Penelope Cruz, Judi Dench, Nicole Kidman, Sophia Loren, Oscar Nominee Kate Hudson, and Stacy Ferguson a.k.a. Fergie. What the film is proud of is ultimately its failure. ",2009

8,"When I first heard the announcements for Golden Globe nominations, they announced a film called ""Nine"". I thought to myself, 'wow, Tim Burton's has done it again...', then they announced the cast, 'Daniel Day Lewis, Nicole Kidman, Fergie...' and I thought...""They were not in that movie, nor did the do the voices for it"". LOL Little to my attention were their 2 movies this year with the title 9. lol.",2009
5,"Today, I went to see Rob Marshall's new musical, Nine, obviously based upon the Broadway musical of the same name, that based off Fellini's 8 1/2. It should be mentioned that the movie contains not quite as many songs as the stage performance does, but, each actress in the wonderful cast having one song, and the way the songs are presented, it certainly works. ",2010
7,"I'll keep this short and sweet. This was gruesome and twistedly faithful to the original in spirit and effect. I totally expected to be the one tortured when watching, well I should have left my preconceived notions at the door. The acting was sharp, the plot devices made just enough sense that it never broke my disbelief and I admittedly had to briefly look away from some scenes.",2009
8,"Let's face it, there are a lot of remakes, there are some good one's: The Thing, The Hills have Eyes, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. There are some average one's: House of Wax, House on Haunted Hill, and War of the Worlds. Then there are the bad one's: Halloween, The Fog, and Psycho. Last House on the Left, my parents had absolutely held me from the original movie, but when I became an adult I rented the movie and watched it by myself, I was just so curious what they were trying to hold me back from, I wasn't really shocked with the movie, I could see how it was gritty and brutal in the day, but after seeing movies like I spit on your grave, Hostel, Dirty Harry, Casino, etc, it just didn't really effect me. So I was actually looking forward to a remake of this just to see what they would do with the story and I have to say that they not only made it better, it was just a very great horror film that made me want to take 15 showers afterwards.",2009
7,"As a fan of the original 1972 version, I wasn't expecting a lot, but at the same time, with Wes being brought in as a producer, I felt it had to live up to some expectations.",2009
7,"If you've ever read any of my other reviews you know how I feel personally about re-makes. Most horror fans feel the same way I do (yet we still watch these things!) so needless to say I went into this movie expecting to be disappointed. I was actually pleasantly surprised by how well this one was. Yes there are the usual cases of character name changes, scene and dialog changes and complete story line changes for no apparent reason but the basic premise that made the original film so creepy was somehow still retained. The major story line change in this one has been discussed in previous reviews and revolves around main character Mari (I won't reveal any major changes for the benefit of those who haven't seen it yet) and yes I was EXTREMELY disappointed with these changes but as I said I went into the film expecting to be let down so this helped to soften the blow. This version of ""Last House on the Left"" has a considerable amount of added gore sequences as well but they are not overly done or thrown in for no apparent reason other than shock value (as was the case in the unofficial 'Last House on the Left' re-make 'Chaos' directed by David DeFalco). Nowadays there really is no way to re-create the grainy, almost documentary like filming style of the original which is one of the main elements that added to the general feel of the film, but these filmmakers did an exceptional job of making the viewer curl in disgust at the actions of the villains and cheer and applaud the violence that befalls them. If you enjoyed the original you will most likely enjoy this one as well...just make sure you watch it and avoid the aforementioned ""Chaos"".",2009
7,"Last House on the Left is a revenge flick sure, but it's also study on pure maternal instinct and revenge. It is also a remake of the 1972 film by Wes Craven, which in turn is a remake of the art film, Virgin Spring (1960) by Ingmar Bergman.",2009
8,"What I took into Last House 09 was what I knew about the original (by the way i have the original movie on DVD and it has been sitting there unwatched for a few years), and I must admit it's definitely a quality movie, great acting, wrought tension and great scares, i must say there were times I was hiding behind my hands because it was so suspenseful.",2009
6,"This rendition based on Wes Craven's film debut is a modern little production that rises above its unsettling plot , passable production values and via its grimly affecting portrait of human evil infiltrating a middle-class household. The story is adapted from ¨Ingmar Bergman's The Virgin Spring ¨, but the movie has more in common with ¨Sam Peckinpah's Straw Dogs¨ as it charts the descent of a harmless married couple (Tony Goldwyn , Monica Potter) into methodical killers . A quartet of criminals -a distorted version of the nuclear family , a sadistic Manson type group- kidnaps a pair of teenage girls (Sara Paxton, Marta MacIsaac) and proceeds to ravage, rape, and finally brutally torture them in the forest , unwittingly within walking distance of their rural house . The murderers take refuge in the one girls' own home, only to meet even sterner justice , as when the parents discover just who they are and what they have done, they plot violent vendetta , taking a peculiar retribution .",2010
10,"Let me start off by saying that I really am not a fan of the original. It was way to cheesy for me. When I first seen the previews for the remake, I knew that it would be good. I was 100% right. ",2010
8,"I don't think I have to introduce people to the original Last House, the storyline here is the same. So a remake. They who have seen my reviews know that I'm not into remakes. Friday the 13th missing something, My Bloody Valentine had some I Know What You Did over it. The only remakes that were good so far were The Hills and Halloween. Well, add this one too. It clocks in over more than 90 minutes just like MBV, I watched my watch a lot when watching MBV, I never did watching this gem. This movie doesn't have any CGI, they go for brutality and straight horror. From the first 5 minutes you know what you will get. The first part is the humiliation of the two girls, the second part is the revenge, both coming straight to you, and the score helps too. The score does work here. All actors are believable. After having some rough movies from France I guess Hollywood has his lesson, here they proof that they are capable of making them too (without the help of French directors like The Hills). I was very surprised with this remake. Oh yeah, there is nudity but I doesn't distract you from the storyline as it did with MBV. A must have in your collection.",2009

10,"This is my first review on IMDb so be gentle! I was so pleased with the film I joined to let others know my views. I have seen my fair share of remakes and have been very disappointed with the majority of them, I am happy to say I found this to be a very worthy remake, I would go as far to say that it was actually better than the original in a lot of ways! I watched the original as a child and found it pretty disturbing but a very well executed horror, I recently watched it again in anticipation of the 2009 release and wasn't as impressed, I know that the grainy dated footage added something to the film, somehow documentary style and with the budget they had Wes Craven done a very good job, however I think it was let down a bit by the music which was very inappropriate and sounded like it could have been in a comedy this and the fact my girlfriend was giggling at some of the movie didn't help, particularly the two policemen and their antics, they seemed like a comedy duo which detracted from the dark story, maybe this was deliberate and was intended to give us a break from the harsh storyline? However that aside it is a classic film which I was hoping would be done justice.",2009
1,"Seriously....what is it with this trend of remaking classics, and replacing the casts with Benetton models? This movie was weak, compared to the 1972 original. It copped out on all the 'sleazy' elements that MADE the original such a hit, and replaced it with silly macho heroics, a cast devoid of ANY personality, and pointless gore. Look at the 1972 version.....that was a nasty movie, that earned the criticism it provoked. The cast was excellent, haunting music, just enough on-screen violence to get it's point across, but plenty of what Hollywood is too scared to replicate nowadays......NASTINESS. At least the original portrayed what actually happens to people taking the law into their own hands, in a realistic manner. This remake gives the impression that it's OK to torture people, afterwards (losing all of what made the original movie so dark) Look at the end of LHOTL (72) the father and mother are morbidly disgusted by their actions (however justified) and are soon to be carted off to prison for their actions. The remake has no connection with reality at all, and even feels the need to tack on an extra amount of added brutality, as if to keep up with HOSTEL 2, whilst forgetting that it's missed the point completely and portrayed the parents as even bigger psychopaths (hell, their daughter doesn't even die in this one!!!!!)",2009

1,"A truly unforgettable film.....If I live to be 180 years old, I'll never be able to forget this film....It's that bad. Easily one of the all time worst movies ever made. Not only is this film full of continuity errors, atrocious dialog and painful performances, there is a rape scene that drags on for entirely too long. In my opinion, it's hard to understand why a rape scene is needed to tell any story properly. It seems that basic human decency would serve as a guide to keep gratuitous scenes of rape to a minimum. However, there is a rape scene in this movie that goes on for entirely too long and is graphic beyond what is necessary to move the scene along. It's almost like this movie was made by sick bastards for sick bastards.",2010
7,"I had watched the original with friends before. What attracted it to us was the way the movie was being put across ""to avoid fainting keep repeating it's just a movie"" etc. We loved horror and anything just generally shocking it was the most fun along with comedy's you could have with friends!. Well it certainly did not let anyone one of us down it was pretty insane?! shall we say. Either way a truly great piece of horror beyond what any of us had seen at the time.",2009

For me, scary horror films are ones like the originals of psycho, alien, the exorcist and poltergeist.

9,"As we all know, the horror remake has become a genre in its own way. With each remake, we constantly complain that Hollywood is running out of ideas and is turning to the cheap thrills of half assed remakes to get their buck as quickly as they can. Virtually every major horror film of the 1970's and 1980's has already been remade, or is on its way (hello, Hellraiser and A Nightmare On Elm Street!). While there have been some terrible abominations to their originals, the 2009 version of Wes Craven's ""The Last House On the Left"" is not even close to those, surpassing the others to become the best horror remake to date. While some may say, ""that's like being the best video game movie!"", I assure you, this is a thriller that thrills, scares, and knows how to get the audience involved with the film.",2009
8,"Revenge extremists should love this. As finally coming around to view this as buying the DVD back in 2011, I was in no way disappointed. I was humbly content. Although this horror revenge flick, beautifully paced in it's 108 minutes, fails to some predictabilities (especially if seeing I Spit On Your Grave) this is a quite taut and at times, bloody disturbing psycho thriller. These moments are mostly the rape scenes, the worst of it Paxton's friend getting it, you can't wait for merciless revenge to be exacted. Again the pacing is perfect. Hot teeny, Paxton (god she looks great in a bikini) and her hot friend make a fatal mistake, when going to score some blow off a shy boy, who's returning a favour for one of the girls. Unfortunately, this shy, good kid, happens to belong to this psychotic family, the white trash piece of s..t father, a wanted man. What was a downer for me, was I expected the avenging family to wreak more violent acts on this vermin. The icing on the cake with Goldwyn frying the guys head in a microwave until it exploded (reminiscent to the scene in Scanners) partially made up for it, so I was kind of reimbursed.",2014

8,"Apart from having the longest reign in British history (63 years), Queen Victoria also holds two other distinctions. She was, apart from our current Queen, the oldest ever British monarch, living to the age of 81. And she was also the youngest ever British (as opposed to English or Scottish) monarch, coming to the throne as a girl of eighteen. And yet whenever television or the cinema make a programme or film about her, they seem far more interested in the older Victoria than they do in the young girl; the version of Victoria with which modern audiences will probably be most familiar is Judi Dench in ""Mrs Brown"". ""The Young Victoria"" tries to redress the balance by showing us the events surrounding her accession and the early years of her reign. It has the rare distinction of being produced by a former Royal, Sarah Duchess of York, whose daughter Princess Beatrice makes a brief appearance as an extra.",2009
7,"Sometimes I'm glad that my grasp of English history is pathetically feeble. It makes movies like ""The Young Victoria"" much more suspenseful than they might otherwise be. I of course knew that Victoria reigned for a large part of the 19th century and that she died in 1901; I also knew that she was a renowned and powerful monarch. I didn't know much about her love life, and ""The Young Victoria"" filled that gap in my knowledge nicely.",2010
8,"Princess Victoria (Emily Blunt) is in line for the throne of England. The present King William (Jim Broadbent) is not well and may not live long. However, Vicky's scheming mother, The Duchess of Kent (Miranda Richandson) and her aide, John (Mark Strong) want to force Victoria to sign papers declaring them to be the ""regents"" until she is older, since she is only 20 years of age. The young lady refuses, despite John slapping her around. It is another sign that Victoria has a strong will and deep love for her country. Yet, when William does pass away, shortly after her 21st birthday, Victoria knows she has a heavy duty before her. First, she must surround herself with the ""right"" advisers to govern wisely. She chooses handsome Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany) who, although an older man, is mentioned as a suitor for Vicky. Which brings us to the young queen's second major decision. Sooner than not, the young queen should select her future mate, as it will bring stability to her life and to those of the kingdom, for an heir must appear in the coming years. Meanwhile, in Germany, some distant relatives of the British royal family are hatching some plans as well. Handsome Prince Albert (Rupert Friend), of the Saxon-Coburg dynasty, is prodded by his father to court the young English royal. Once he arrives at the palace, he is smitten and the feeling seems to be mutual. But, since he is a minor player on the map of royal match-making, can he succeed in winning her heart? This is a lovely film, made even better by a completely winning performance by Emily Blunt as Victoria. Yes, she is beautiful but it is her intelligent reading of the role that scores mightily. Friend, too, does well, as do the other actors, including Broadbent, Richardson, Bettany, Strong (what a repulsive role!), and the rest. Also, the movie is gorgeously shot, costumed, and set, making it a visual treat in every way. If anything is lacking, it is an extra dose of dazzle, as the film seems a bit too straightforward and prosaic, at times, with a somewhat unimaginative edit. However, this is only a minor, minor point of argument in an overall very successful and gorgeous film. In short, young and old, should make time for Young Victoria. It is a most worthy film among 2009 cinematic offerings.",2010
8,"The 63 year reign of Queen Victoria is perhaps one of the most documented and popularly known historical reigns in British history. On the one hand, her story lacks the theatrics of earlier royals thanks to a change in social climate and attitudes, and on the other her story is one that perpetuates because it is notably human. Taking on the earlier years of her life where the budding romance between herself and the German Prince Albert was taking forefront, director Jean-Marc Vallée who has only until recently remained in the unbeknownst shadows of the industry here takes Victoria's story and captures that human element so vital to her legacy. It's a story that feels extremely humble considering its exuberant background, and yet that's partly what gives it a distinct edge here that separates it from the usual fare.",2009
9,"Despite some reviews being distinctly Luke-warm, I found the story totally engrossing and even if some critics have described the love story as 'Mills and Boon', so what? It is good to see a warm, touching story of real love in these cynical times. Many in the audience were sniffing and surreptitiously dabbing their eyes. You really believe that the young Victoria and Albert are passionately fond of each other, even though, for political reasons, it was an arranged marriage. I did feel though that Sir John Conroy, who was desperate to control the young Queen, is perhaps played too like a pantomime villain. As it is rumoured that he was in fact, the real father of Victoria (as a result of an affair with her mother The Duchess of Kent) it would have been interesting to explore this theory. Emily Blunt is totally convincing as the young Princess, trapped in the stifling palace with courtiers and politicians out to manipulate her. She brilliantly portrays the strength of character and determination that eventually made Victoria a great Queen of England, which prospered as never before, under her long reign. I believe word of mouth recommendations will ensure great success for this most enjoyable and wonderful looking movie.",2009
6,"Greetings again from the darkness. Emily Blunt would have stolen The Devil Wears Prada if not for the queen of screen, Meryl Streep. Here she competes with no one and does a nice job of carrying the film based on the early years of Queen Victoria. If you are rusty on your British sovereign history, she ruled from 1837-1901.",2010
7,"Rupert Friend gives a performance, as Prince Albert, that lifts ""The Young Victoria"" to unexpected levels. He is superb. As we know, Queen Victoria fell into a dark, deep depression after Prince Albert's death and looking into Ruper Friend's eyes I understood. The film doesn't take us to his death but to an incident that may very well could have cost his life. An act of love. I believed it, or I should say, him. I believed what he felt was real. Nothing or anybody gets anywhere near the delicacy and profundity of Friend's characterization. Emily Blunt is good but I didn't believe for a minute she was Victoria. No real sense of period. It may no have been her fault but her prince deserved the crown.",2010

8,"I just came back from seeing The Young Victoria. What a beautiful movie! Despite some flaws, I think it's probably the strongest costume drama we've had since 2006's Amazing Grace, although unlike Amazing Grace I don't think it's going to become one of my favorites. Let me set out by stating my problem with the movie: the pacing (also a common criticism of AG, but one that I considered unfounded in that instance). A large portion of it consists of a flashback, and a very awkwardly set up flashback at that; however, even putting that sequence aside, the narrative structure is just odd. The various scenes and plot threads just seem to be cobbled together without any dramatic purpose. But then again, I caught myself thinking that this approach—while questionable artistically—might better reflect real life than a more typical scriptwriting/editing job. The ending, too, doesn't feel particularly conclusive, but again this seems to be a conscious decision. Whether these things sink the movie or not is debatable, but they certainly distracted me.",2010
8,"As a history teacher, watching this sort of film is pretty natural. However, it was actually my youngest daughter and her obsession with the British monarchy that got me to watch this film. I am happy to report that this film was far better than I expected, as I usually HATE costume dramas because they are very dull and stuffy--with way too much emphasis on clothing. ""The Young Victoria"" succeeds because it attempts to show the viewer insights into the personality of the princess--not just show you a series of events from her life that are re-created on screen.",2010

Needless to say, it makes for very fascinating and informative viewing.",2009
8,"One of those beautifully intense movies that draws us so intimately far in, it ends much to soon! Than were left looking at the screen like, ""No they didn't!"", lol. Good performances all around! The acting is marvelous with Emily Blunt simply outstanding! I knew she would give a solid, convincing performance catching young Victoria's regality, temper, and vulnerability through out the entire movie. Also, the production is outstanding in every way: style, substance and sensitivity. A remarkable glimpse at a remarkable time in Britian's history told via a very personal and touching biography of the school age princess until her reign as Queen, later marrying Prince Albert, than ending with the birth of their first of nine children. It had a well written screenplay and flawless editing. Rupert Friend as the ever so patient and compassionate young Prince Albert vying to win the young Queen's attention, than securing her love, before Lord Melbourne(Paul Bettany), was engrossing to watch. Just as engrossing was the relationship between the teenage Victoria and her mother, which was fury at times, as with her mother and King William (whom also disliked her mother). The acting and scenes were captivating, highly emotional. ",2009

For every other demographic watching the film, this reviewer included, the political intrigue of a dying king, an overbearing mother and a manipulative PM, however, isn't quite as rewarding.",2010

What makes it an interesting movie is that the young woman happens to be the Queen of England. The love story between Queen Victoria and Prince Albert has been told many times.

10,"Man I got to tell ya it is so nice to see something different that has the intensity of a mature movie yet lies within the realm of the animated world. Every scene was beautifully done and you can literally hang every frame up on a wall if you so choose to. The story was great, the suspense was amazing. Who ever complained about it not having a story, tell that to the crowd I saw jumping every so often from the intense confrontations. What I also liked about it was the hidden parts of the story. They give you enough information to enjoy the film but yet you can extract more of the back ground thought that went into what we saw in the completed film. For the first time ever I saw half of the audience stay behind after the credits role to not just see who worked on the movie but to debate back and forth about what they thought of it, what the characters represented, what happen in this or that scene, and of course the animation style and technique and how it moved them. Never seen anyone ever do that after watching a movie.",2009
7,"I was looking forward to seeing 9, as I had already seen the original short film (also called 9) and wanted to see what they could do by expanding upon the story. Well, after seeing this full-length film, I can certainly say I liked the computer generated animation....as for the story, well, it left a bit to be desired. And the problem is that I can't strongly recommend the film, but if you don't see it in the theater, then you'll probably like the film less because the graphics are THE film.",2009
5,"I might have had my expectations too high when I walked into the theater. I hadn't done any reading and was under the impression that Tim Burton had directed it.

His talents expressed here, his first feature adapted from his short film of the same title, are immense and sharp and clear and dark and staggering and other words I didn't have time to look up for this review. He takes a scenario one could be familiar with- entities battling robotic elements in a future or just another time period, a desolate wasteland, a possibility of hope on the horizon- but it's infused with the passion and archetypes of a fairy tale. And even with this there's certain twists, or unexpected pleasures. You'll see a lot of critics talk about the lack of a full story, of the beauty of the animation and look of the film outweighing any kind of story or clearly defined characters. You can take that to heart before seeing the film, but a lot of them may have missed Acker's intention here.",2009

And then you add the genius of Russian director Timur Bekmambetov to the mix and to me it was a no brainer. I was going to see this movie. Burton AND the guy that has brought us such visually complex and action-packed fare as Wanted, Night Watch, and Day Watch supporting a movie? It had to be good.",2009

He did produce the brilliant ""Nightmare Before Christmas"", which is one I've watched multiple times, and directed movies like ""Beetlejuice"" and ""Sleepy Hollow"", which are awesome films. Bekmambetov directed 3 films that I LOVE: Night Watch, Day Watch, and Wanted. I've only seen those three of his, but they prove he's an awesome director.",2009

8,"Anybody wanting an intelligent, insightful, or mesmerizing motion picture should readjust they're expectations before walking into Pandorum. There are a few themes here that are interesting and the characters aren't dumb (some are engineers and scientists, after all), but chances are you've already seen these archetypes in countless movies already. As for whom to recommend this film to, if you enjoyed Event Horizon and/or Alien³, there's no reason why you wouldn't find anything to like in this film. However, contrary to what many people have said, Pandorum seems to resemble another film, Eden Log (a French sci-fi/horror picture), much more than either of the previously mentioned. As in Eden Log, our central characters wake up with no memory of how they came to be in their isolated environments. Likewise, they also have to explore an isolated world around them were horrible things have occurred and monsters seem to be looming. Even more interesting is that both films feature protagonists caught up in the mix of highly mysterious projects entitled ""Eden."" Our two main characters are Corporal Bower and Lt. Payton, played by Ben Foster and Dennis Quaid respectively. The two wake up disoriented and contained (i.e. trapped) in a small hypersleep chamber designated for the Elysium (the name of the large vessel of characters are aboard) crew of Flight Team 5. Unaware of what has happened to the other crew members the two begin to analyze their situation and Bower, being a technical/mechanical engineer, notices electrical surges throughout the ship signal that the nuclear reactor core in the Elysium is about to overload and shutdown. The two begin a makeshift mission to try to save the ship, with Bower climbing through ducts and exploring the wasteland left of the craft and Payton guiding him over a comlink and a crank-generator powered computer terminal. If you've seen any of the Alien films or played the videogames Doom or Dead Space, this should sound quite familiar.",2009

8,"In 2174, the natural resources of Earth are exhausted and the spacecraft Elysium is launched to the planet Tanis in the last hope of mankind. Due to the long travel, the crew-members are divided in teams that travel in extended hyper-sleep, rotating in shifts along the trip. When Corporal Bower (Ben Foster) from Flight Team 5 wakes up due to a malfunctioning of his chamber, he is disoriented and with amnesia. But sooner he realizes that the reactor is not working and provoking power surges in the ship. Then Lieutenant Payton (Dennis Quaid) also awakes and they find that they are locked in a room but the access door to the bridge is not reactivated. Bower moves through the ventilation trunk trying to open the door from outside. Sooner he discovers that there is some weird threatening life form in the ship and running is always the best option to survive. When he meets the biologist Nadia (Antje Traue) and the strong farmer Manh (Cung Le), they team up trying to reach the reactor and save their lives. Meanwhile, Payton rescues Corporal Gallo in the room, but the menace of the paranoid Pandorum psychological trauma seems to be affecting Gallo. ",2010

10,"Pandorum is an amazingly original and crafty sci-fi/horror film. The premise is well thought out and the script delivers bang on from the opening scene to the end. This movie grabs you like a vice right from the start, and never releases until the final credits. The mise-en-scene is beautifully dark and realistic, against the juxtaposition of human beings waking up in a ship without memories of who they are or their mission. The audience explores with the two crew members unraveling the mystery. There are many twists in this film and it's hard to find words without spoilingso just go see ityou won't be disappointed.",2009

I believe in the saying 'it is all in your head'. So, this is the sort of horror that messes with your head. I think it is the best kind. You get the most thrill out of it. I had a great time watching this film. I bit my nails, I jumped in my seat, but I couldn't tear myself away from the screen even though at times I was terrified to my core. I disagree with those who say that the story is boring. It had twists and turns and you can never guess the ending. To me it is one of the key elements in movies. I want a surprise.

This film is one of the most terrifying action/horror/sci-fi movies I have seen in a very long time, but that's not the best part! The best part is the intriguing story with some amazing twists! Some are obvious and at least one is just completely unexpected, but none of them feel overly typical. Ben Foster is really really good in this and I must say that he is getting much better at picking roles, with 3:10 to Yuma and now this! One thing that really stuck out to me also, was how much some of it reminded me of the game Dead Space, don't read into that too much as far as story goes, it's just that there are a few elements that I think were inspired by the game, and if you have played Dead Space, I think you will know what I mean when you see it. This movie was good, really good, and finally gave me the space horror/fiction fix I have been craving since the last good space movie, Sunshine, by Danny Boyle. Go see this movie!",2009

I found myself with that scared sunken in the stomach feeling that i've not had for many a year, and certainly not had with recent horror films. What a very clever idea, strong acting, gorgeous effects, very novel to have such a mix of a cast. I find it very frustrating when i expect a lot from a film and don't get it, here the reverse has happened. I think most people would enjoy this. Think Dr Who Ark in Space meets Silent Hill, perhaps that's an idea of the mix. 9.5/10.00",2011

What I loved the most about the movie is that it doesn't give you all the answers, it let's you imagine and figure them out. The other thing that I loved is the claustrophobic ambiance and disturbing scenes folding one after the other. Just amazing. The only thing that I didn't like so much was Dennis Quaid performance, don't misunderstand me, he's a terrific actor, I just think he can do better than that. I'm giving a 9 stars to this movie. It has become one of my favorites of all times. Go watch it.",2009
8,"Visually this is a stunning movie. Set almost entirely on a vast spaceship that has lost power, the action takes place in illumination provided by glow sticks and the occasional flickering flashlight. The ship is awesome. The action is great. The plot is original and kept me interested to the end. But I do object to having to watch a movie purportedly in English with the subtitles on to be able to understand what was going on. Some of the cast members had accents so indecipherable it was as bad as listening to those who apparently didn't speak English at all. The lead mumbled. And you do really need to hear what is being said in this film. It's not mindless action by any means. I wanted to know why they were out in space, what their mission was, why and how it had all gone so wrong. Highly recommended.",2016

But there's also the Alien movies, the first Species, Pitch Black, Event Horizon, and even the Resident Evil movies that hit the nail on the head.

9,"And by rating I mean the ""PG-13"" one. Seems like you can get away with murder these days with a PG-13 rating ... Seriously though: While this was one detail that got discussed quite a bit, even before the movie came out, many ""fearing"" (no pun intended) that Raimi had lost his touch and had gone ""soft"" on them.",2010
8,"Personally I thought movies like the ""Spiderman""-trilogy, ""A Simple Plan"" and ""For Love Of The Game"" were excellent, but they all shared a common flaw: they made Sam Raimi look like a mentally balanced person. ""Drag Me To Hell"" on the other hand wants none of that, it caters to the ""Evil Dead""-crowd and does so very well. There isn't much of a story, but that's pretty much the point. Raimi has always stated he wants his horror flicks to be non-stop fun, and that's exactly what this is. It's a pretty stream of consciousness sort of thing, the feeble plot about Alison ""Big Fish"" Lohman getting cursed is just an excuse to come up with as much demented stuff as humanly possible. Put some maggots in a pie and then somehow make it bleed, why not huh? Anything goes here, that keeps things interesting throughout. You never know what's going to happen next, which is pretty damn scary. It's also a plus that eventually the movie works up to one of the the greatest climactic scenes I've ever seen in a horror movie, now that's what I call a finale. Overall this is a great movie that won't let anybody down.",2011

I loved Evil Dead and I still don't get it, because this wasn't campy -- it was just bad. Seemed thrown together very quickly, with a few scenes stripped whole from Evil Dead 2 and some of the worst writing ever... It just didn't feel like camp. It felt like dreck. And the ending was telegraphed so early in the film that the last 30 minutes were almost physically painful to watch. And yet... the Washington Post said the ending was a shocker.",2009

8,"Drag me to Hell is, really, a throwback in so many ways to the fun of The Evil Dead 2. The camera angles, the excellent score - it all recalls how Raimi played with us in his earlier trilogy. What has changed however, is the sense of pace. We know its coming and Raimi employs all his skills to draw out the tension. The thrills are all there in place, I jumped like there was an electric buzzer under my seat. Perhaps a little too much CGI is indulged in but its easy to forgive in a film as wicked and blackly comic as this. I genuinely found the film disturbing for a 15 as well, again I think this is a mark of tension that Raimi creates with the score and camera work throughout the film. So incredibly refreshing to see a horror film with out the hallmarks of the recent saw franchise. Special mention for the ending, which has conviction and guts and was the proverbial cherry on top of the cake. throughly entertaining.",2009

Shortly afterwards and elderly woman comes in asking for her loan to be extended when the bank foreclosed on her mortgage. She takes the woman's case to her boss but he leaves it up to her to decide what to do she decides to take the tough decision and refuses the old woman's request. The woman starts begging and Christine calls for security. She is shaken but assumes it is over; it isn't the woman later attacks her and tells her that she is cursed. Christine decides to see a spiritualist and he tells her that she has indeed been cursed; she will be tormented for three days then she will literally be dragged to Hell!! Over the next three days she is indeed tormented and, along with the spiritualist, she tries to find a way to get out of the curse.",2015

Yet as wholly cheesy as that proclamation is, it is no less true. Ultimate B movie director Sami Rami's first horror film in years, having dedicated himself to the Spiderman franchise, succeeds in putting almost all recent horror films to shame. Drag Me to Hell proves that an R rating is not needed for shock scares, nor does a PG-13 rating mean that the film must feel stunted and incomplete, only that it takes a dedicated and competent director to pull all the elements together.",2009

Sighs were coming from my right and the people to my left were getting restless. I wanted to ask someone else the time; hoping that my phone had jammed and this ""picture"" was farther along than it seemed.

Starring Alison Lohman in the leading role (Ellen Page was originally cast as the lead but dropped out of the project early in production), Drag Me to Hell feels like much more than your average, predictable horror popcorn flick. It's filled with plenty of twists and turns and, like any good ride, a satisfying conclusion. And the PG-13 rating? Forget about it! You hardly notice that little factor because of how immersed you become in the story. Also starring are Justin Long, David Paymer, and Lorna Raver.",2009

I couldn't even enjoy my popcorn due to scenes of an old woman with no teeth sucking several times on a persons chin (this was suppose to be some sort of attack i think), the best and only good thing about this movie was the credits.

9,"To properly (and fairly) access my experience with seeing ""Drag Me To Hell"" Sam Raimi's (The Gift, Spider Man) much anticipated and blogged about new opus, we must first take a little trip back in time to the year 1995. As a kid, I had always been intrigued by the horror genre, most of which likely spawned from my parent's extreme hatred towards it. While they perused the Comedy and Drama sections of our old video store (then stocked to the brim with VHS tapes, I might add) I found myself sneaking off to the far left corner among the gory, trashy, at often times downright pornographic cover art that adorned the paper sleeves for films such as ""Invasion of the Blood Farmers"" and ""Deadtime Stories"".

As the story moves on, Tommy's negative attitude toward her and his outlook changes and their relationship develops.

8,"Brothers is something we may have seen before - if not in its original incarnation from Denmark in 2004 then The Deer Hunter - then it is something that surprises just on the vulnerability, subtlety and ferocity of the actors in their roles. It's not about what the trailer pushes, which is an affair between a guy (Jake Gyllenhaal) and his sister in law (Natalie Portman) while the one guy's brother (Tobey Maguire) is away at war. There is one scene of that, but that's not really what the film is 'about' per-say. It's about the personal affects of war on one man, a horrific tragedy that befalls him, and how he has to live with that the rest of his life, specifically in front of his wife and children. Maguire's Sam says it simply towards the end: ""Only the dead see the end of war. I have seen the end of War. How do I go on living?"" ",2009

Grace does not like him either but Sam invites Tommy to have dinner at home with their family. When Sam is sent back to Afghanistan, his helicopter crashes and he is considered missing in action and presumed dead. However, he is captured with friend Private Joe Willis (Patrick Flueger) and they are submitted to all sort of tortures, culminating with Sam killing Joe with a bar. Meanwhile Tommy comforts Grace and the children and he becomes close to Sam's family. When Sam is rescued by the American soldiers, he comes back home completely paranoid, psychotic, introspective and without feeling or affection for his family. Further, he is convinced that Grace and Tommy have had sex during his absence. When Isabelle lies during a family dinner about the relationship of Grace and Tommy to upset her father, the disturbed Sam triggers an intense paranoia jeopardizing his family, Tommy and himself.

5,"I watched the original Danish version of this film some time ago. Connie Neilsen was stunning as the wife, Nikolas Lie Kaaj was good as the brother, and Ulrich Thomsen fitted the role of the Captain like a glove - mature, grave and, upon his return, with a sense of foreboding. In this remake, Natalie Portman is superb, while Jake Gyllenhaal, Sam Shepard and the 2 kids are all excellent. But Tobey Maguire is no Ulrich Thomsen. It's not that he's a bad actor, it's just that casting him as Captain Cahill of the Marines was akin to picking Russell Crowe to play Rudolph Nureyev in the film version of ""Swan Lake"".",2010

Sam (Tobey Maguire) is an upright family man and lifelong Marine who has already served one tour in Afghanistan and is all set to embark on a second. Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a ne'er-do-well ex-con who's released from prison on the very same week Sam is being re-deployed to the battlefield, leaving a wife (Natalie Portman) and two young daughters (the delightful Bailee Madison and Taylor Grace Geare) behind at home. When news comes that Sam has been killed in a helicopter crash, Tommy is there to help pick up the pieces, leading to some potential romantic complications between him and his brother's grieving widow, Grace.

10,"I was not looking forward to this film (another anti-military anti-war film) but this is none of that! It is a wonderful story of people and their relationships and emotions. The story is beautifully told and the cast is uniformly wonderful although it seemed at first the brothers might better have switched parts but as the plot unfolds the casting is perfect. The plot: In a family of a retired Marine Sgt (Sam Shepard) there are two sons (Toby Maguire) an active duty Captain and a Ex con wastrel (Jake Guillenhaal) who gets out of prison as his brother is about to return to the war in Afghanistan. When his brother is lost in Afghanistan the brother slowing steps up to support the wife and two girls. When Maguire Is found alive months later the dynamic of the family is greatly changed as the whole family works out the complications of their lives. This is one of the best pictures of the year, dramatic, involving, with good dialog and scene; and the actors and director play them to the hilt.",2009

6,"Please watch the original film Brødre (2004) by Susanne Bier instead. It's in Danish with English subtitles. It's more authentic and characters are depicted more in depth. Typically, it's a subtitled gem overlooked by a domestic audience. There was no need for a remake in the first place other than to embrace most of the ignorant American audience. Pardon my french. Most of you will be familiar with Connie Nielsen. However, Ulrich Thomsen is the most important character and does a superb acting in Brødre by changing the nature of his character. You can pick it up on Amazon but make sure to get in a format supported by your DVD-player.",2010
10,"After reading several of the recent votes for this film, I've realized that most of the viewers see this more of an entertainment piece and have not absorbed the message. Having been a witness to the actions that Sam displayed on screen these are incredibly accurate, to the perfect alignment and position to the glasses and mugs in the new kitchen, the gun drawn when the dog was barking outside, the smashing of the kitchen, the anger and paranoia (of Tommy and his wife and the anger and belligerence with the police). Even the self-abuse when Sam was hitting himself out of frustration. We noticed at the dinner table when he first arrived home that he didn't have the humor he once possessed when his daughter was relating the dog and the elephant. He never wanted to hurt anyone but was still holding the fire poker because a side of him probably wanted to kill everyone who was in his way and also when he put the gun to his head. Tommy and Sam say throughout the film ""you're my brother"" because the writer wanted to emphasize that Sam still has the human attachment to people but is now withdrawn because of his experiences. I only hope that more people will see that this is how too many of our servicemen and woman are coming home to. This was a remarkable, emotional, and realistic to what really happens.",2009
3,"I'm a big fan of Jim Sheridan films, and this had a superb cast so expectations were high for this movie. Unfortunately for me, it never got going and some of that has to be attributed to casting. Tobey Maguire still looks like a 14 year old weakling so I couldn't see him as this veteran marine captain. Similarly, Jake Gylenhall is too much of a nice guy to play a convicted felon, maybe he wasn't meant to ""threaten"" here but was too nice in the role for me.",2010

10,"Brothers is the 2nd War themed movie of 2009 to emphasize the human psyche over guts and glory. Where Mel Gibson's We Were Soldiers faltered at bringing home the sense of loss and devastation that the wives and mothers endure during wartime, Jim Sheridan nails it by keeping it personal in this film. There are no glorious shootouts, or supermen taking out hundreds with a pistol through a hailstorm of shrapnel. What we get is the premise of loyalty, bravery and sacrifice through soldier and civilian alike in a powerful drama appropriately named for the love between Tommy and Sam.",2009

This awful version of Brothers (Mr Sheridan didn't even bother changing the title) is a water down movie wonderland of the original gripping drama. The characters become unbelievable and over the top. Whilst some of the original storyline has been kept, some very important parts are removed. The original movie focuses on the horror of war, of family life while a soldier is away and comes back. It does not focus on which side is the ""good side"" and who is ""the bad side"" and the ""glory"" of war. (unlike Mr Sheridans) He really has missed the main point of the movie.",2010

Why does the loser brother hang around so much? Why does the wife attempt to dump her 'goody two-shoes' image and smoke pot with the ex-con drunk brother-in-law? Who thought up the scene of the fatal beating in the terrorist camp? Why did the film have to rely on such clichés as: *ex-Marine dad favoring one son. *wife & bro-in-law getting it on. *creepy-looking daughter not getting any help in reconnecting w/her dad(hey thanks prev poster, i forgot all about the creepy daughter & her way-too-adult commentary about 'mom would rather sleep w/uncle' at the dining table=what drivel!). *wife kissing war scars on back. *dead soldier buddy's wife with dreams too close to the truth.

Taking his job very seriously and loving the 290 days away from home—the only problem with that is the 70 days at home in his empty apartment—his world gets turned upside-down when a young upstart in the company threatens to ground the company to fire people via the internet. Not standing for a change in his life, nor the chance for his life goal of total airline miles to end, (""Let's just say I have a number and I haven't hit it yet""), he goes on a mission to prove how personal his job is and how key a face to face meeting can be to talk down an emotionally unstable person and really do the victim a service in an otherwise horrible moment in his life. Along the way, he and the recent college grad, of which the boss loves due to her budget slashing game-changing idea, Natalie, played by Anna Kendrick, both find out what has been lacking in their lives and how to become better people, opening up to love, heartbreak, and the need to grow up.",2009

Completely void of human connection and emotion, even from his two sisters, one of which is getting married, Ryan seems completely content with his choice of living. All seems well until he meets his female version in the beautiful and charismatic Alex, played with sexual force and intensity by Vera Farmiga.

A film with a message that's entertaining: what a concept.",2009
10,"So 2009, and the decade known as...(what do we call this decade?), are ending later this month. And there is no better film to wrap up a (frankly) terrible decade (in terms of news events, unemployment, the economy, the media stronghold, the trashing and dumbing down of American culture, technology, narcissism, vanity obsession, a divided nation, violence and hostility) than Up in the Air. The film, the best I've seen all year and one of the best of the decade, captures many of the factors that made this decade the worst one, at least in my 42 years. The 70s may have been bad economically but hey, at least we had Bruce Springsteen and real music on the radio, women still seemed to like men and not only if the men were millionaires, thoughtful movies in the theater, and only five or so TV channels to pick from. Up in the Air features George Clooney as a man with no ""roots,"" (that is, no wife, no kids, and his apartment in Omaha is about as furnished as a room at Embassy Suites), who fires people for a living because the companies who hire him are too cowardly to do it themselves. It is a juicy role for Clooney, who has made a career out of playing easy-talking charmers. The film sounds depressing and in many ways it is, but it is also witty, quietly hilarious at times, and full of pathos when it becomes a morality piece near the middle (and like the best morality pieces, it doesn't shove its message down your throat). It reminded me in many ways of American Beauty, the masterpiece that capped off the '90s when it hit theaters ten years ago. Clooney's character slowly is stripped of the things he only cared about--including a one-night-stand that becomes a ""Same Time Next Year""-like meeting in Hampton Inns and Hiltons in Miami, Detroit, Wichita and other random cities, with another constant traveler (we never know what exactly she does, and that's not supposed to matter) played by Vera Farmiga, who may win an Oscar nomination for her mysterious, slightly passive and jaded, 30something character. The final important character is an eager young Cornell graduate (played by Anna Kendrick, from Twilight) who thinks that a career in firing people is a wise choice now, and in some respects she's not that far off. Her character represents many of the Twitter-obsessed twentysomethings driven for money money money, who live for texting, and has naive and even immature ideals of what makes a relationship work. But she too goes through a transformation, as Up in the Air reaches a ""feel good while feeling bad"" quality of Frank Capra's darker films, like Meet John Doe. One of the most amazing things about this film is its use of real people in the ""firing scenes;"" people who have really lost their jobs several weeks or months before being filmed. Director Jason Reitman combines scenes of these people being fired by Clooney and Kendrick, and their instant responses are wholly authentic. There are a few actors playing the ""firees"" as well, but they blend in with the real folks. I really can't think of a better film to cap off this decade. This one will stay with you. Highly recommended.",2009

Ryan Bingham is a perfect guy, charming, seductive, smart, well-groomed and real gentleman. He's into juice when it's necessary, likes to talk in sarcastic and trenchant tone, has cynic attitude to almost every things in that life especially love and family. No doubt a lot of men dreaming about such life as he has.",2010
2,"What this has going for it: a solid performance by the girl who plays Natalie, a few droll lines, and a twist. But this twist is actually the worst thing about this film. It's worse than the 'Requiem for a Dream' quick-cut repetitive sequences. It's worse than Clooney's relentless crinkly-eyed smile, which I could not take any more, ever, after twenty minutes. It's worse than the cliché parades of fired people and their contrasting reactions, and it's worse than the blatant, blatant, blatant metaphors of travel/solitude/loneliness/baggage. What is it? The twist is when Clooney's character runs from his isolationist preaching gig to find his lady love, only to knock at her door and discover her married and with kids. And this 'twist' took me by surprise simply because the screenplay had made it unthinkable. Had Clooney remained devoted to flying around and the woman an occasional liaison, fine. But LONG BEFORE his dream is shattered by her, he reveals himself changing. He takes her to his old school. He takes her to his sister's wedding. He opens up very, very much. So - her speech to him afterward about his being just a 'good time guy', as well as her anger and confusion, are utterly ridiculous. This made me really angry, that poor writing gets to jump chasms over continuity. All in all, this is Hollywood-as-meaningful tripe. You're better off with the Vampire garbage.",2010

I was quite grateful for having seen Reitman's Thank You For Smoking (2005) previously, because both movies are really arch in the way they set up people in thoroughly pariah job roles and then get you to warm to them. So it didn't really come as a shock to see Clooney as an HR consultant (Ryan Bingham) whose job is to fire people in redundancy exercises where the management are too yeller, instead it rated an amused and knowing eyebrow raise.",2010
1,"This is one of the grimmer, unpleasant, and dehumanizing films I've seen in some time. Basically, its also an extended product-placement ad for American Airlines and Hilton Hotels, whose corporate logos are smacked in your face about every 10 minutes. Also its vaguely like the film ""Koyaanisqatsi"" but with actors and a story-line. I think that if the friends that I saw it with had put our heads together half-way through and done a whispered conference, we would have happily agreed to cut our losses and walk out. We wouldn't have missed much, including one of the more predictable plot ""twists"" in recent years.",2010
6,"Nice message about what's really important in life. Nice delivery without being too obvious or overstated. Realistic characters, rather than caricatures. Good...well, everything.",2010
7,Up In The Air is a nice movie - a good satire about work and a comedy about the price of modern business.,2010
8,"**Major Spoilers** For about two thirds of Up In The Air, I was thinking to myself, ""this is definitely going to be on my top five list for the year."" The acting is very good. The characters were strong and likable. The dialogue was sharp and witty. There seemed to be the right mixture of both comedy and drama. It felt like a movie that was going somewhere great. Then came the rest of the story. Don't get me wrong. I've seen some films before that were ruined by bad endings. Up In The Air does not fall into that category. In fact, I wouldn't even call the ending bad. It was just not as well done as the rest of the movie. It felt hurried and predictable. I honestly don't think any of the events that occurred at the end of the film were a surprise to anyone watching (including the ""major"" revelation about Vera Farmiga's character). And a few of the scenes felt like they were slipped in out of obligation (i.e. the scene where Clooney's character calls the airline to set up a trip for his sister and her husband, or when we find out that Anna Kendrick's character quit because of the suicide). However, even with all of that, I still liked it. There was still so much that was good about this movie, that it might not be on my top five list for the year, but it is definitely on my top ten.",2010
7,Up In the Air Movie Review,2010
1,"Heard wonderful things about this film (mostly through the critics) and was looking forward to it but after seeing it at the Arc Light Theater last night I am wondering what all the critical praise is about? Is it coming from the influence of the heavy hitters on the cast like George Clooney, the Reitman father-son combo, or the studio? Not sure, but I am sure that the film is dry, dull, boring and did not move me in any way (and the audience in the theater).",2009
8,"I attended the World Premiere of ""Up in the Air"" at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. Co-written (with Sheldon Turner), directed, and produced by Academy Award-nominee Jason Reitman from a Walter Kim novel, the film features an all-star cast including George Clooney, Jason Bateman, Anna Kendrick, Vera Farmiga, and Melanie Lynskey.",2009
1,"The fact that Clooney's coat disappeared and reappeared from cut to cut and scene to scene showed me that making a good, fluid, consistent film was not the goal in, Up in the Air, but the point was to deliver a message and that message was pure propaganda. clooney: 'hey buddy, sure we screwed the economy and ruined your life and the life of your wife and kids and your going to be homeless soon but hey, now you can follow your dreams. don't hate your boss or the efficiency expert we hired to fire you because he is a nice guy like george clooney.' ",2010
8,"01-08-10 ""Up in the Air"" is a thoughtful and satisfying entertainment. I'm a big fan of the team of creative artists who made it happen. It's an amazing work of art from auteur, Jason Reitman. All the more impressive is the fact that he's only thirty-two. All of these kudos notwithstanding, I want to briefly address the character of Alex because therein lies a serious flaw. I'm not confirmed in my opinion, however, so I want to put it out here for possible contradiction.",2010
8,"Difficult to rate because I'm conflicted. I have no idea why this hasn't been released in the UK, other than the fact that most of us probably don't get American Football references and it's probably not suitable to be aired on television generally. It's totally gross, sick, rude, inappropriate, blasphemous, obscene, cringeworthy and has jokes about just about everything that I personally find distasteful, and things that I'd usually turn off for. However, it is unavoidably hilarious. Laugh out loud funny even if you are berating yourself for finding something so horrible amusing. You know you should switch off but it's just too funny. It's definitely more boy-humour than girl-humour (think The Hangover) so I'm surprised I like it so much in that respect. None of the characters are particularly likable (I personally like Pete best), but you end up really attached to them, but the comedy is just so clever, fast and observational as well as horrible but there are some big names that have graced it's episodes from the world of Football and there's a great few eps with Jeff Goldblum to name one familiar actor - and he's his fabulous self as ever.",2013
9,The League is a show about 5 high-school buddies facing everyday life concerns while mercilessly ridiculing each other and placing way too much importance on their fantasy football league!,2011
9,"when i first heard about this show being about fantasy football i was interested. but after seeing this show it is 80% comedy and 20% fantasy football. so you don't have to be a fantasy football player to enjoy it. obviously if you do like fantasy football you'll get all the jokes. but it also offers straight up guy comedy, and its really good guy comedy. the show is too funny, and its on cable. easily the funniest show fx has come out with. since always sunny started on hbo and doesn't really count, ""the league"" is their show. all i know is that i want to know what happens throughout the season. and if this series succeeds like it should, how can it end. because fantasy football is going to be around for a while. watch the show, its funny.",2009
10,"This series ranks as one of my favorites. Rescue me, Always Sunny, Now this...FX gets it. I've only seen the 1st two episodes and I have to say my buddies and I are hooked. Even my buddies agree that this is so funny. Mild profanity but nothing bad, and great characters. Well written, I cant wait for next week.",2009
10,"This is one of the best, by far in my opinion, comedies out there. For me it has successfully filled the void left by Arrested Development. There are other shows that fill this void as well but this one of the few shows that satisfies my desire for quick witted humor combined with sophomoric humor. My wife feels it's a guy's show. I can't entirely disagree. I would say it is definitely aimed at the very people it features. But also I would say anyone who likes sharp and fast humor like Arrested or Sunny will like this. There is definitely enough humor that goes outside fantasy football to appeal to a more general demographic. I think my favorite part of the is that it is lauded as semi scripted which to me really comes out in the dialogue. You can tell that there are times when they are genuinely laughing at the jokes or barbs each other throws out there unexpectedly. This also adds to the chemistry of the characters and the naturalness of the show. It really feels like you're watching 5 friends/couples going back and forth and arguing or discussing etc. Supposedly, and I believe it, the main actors are all friends in real life and even do a fantasy league with the shows creators. Regardless of whether that is true or not I think this is a true comedy gem that should be around for a long time.",2011
10,"This show is very humorous, and is still about football. It is about football enough to intrigue football fans, but not enough to bore people who know nothing about football. Because the show is semi-scripted, the acting also has a very real feel to it. The show is relative to average life and just is enjoyable to watch. Even the humor is the kind that is relative to the normal person. Just the way the characters talk is so believable, its like they are not actors, they are just a group of friends on film. ",2011
10,"My dad has me hooked on this show. it took about 3 episodes before I absolutely had to watch. It is now a part of my DVR schedule, and if you have Netflix, the show has all seasons minus the 2013 season on it. It appears FxX is repeating a bunch of the 2013, so people should be able to catch up.",2013
10,"The League is incredible, whereas most series's take a while to get into this is completely the opposite. This series has you laughing right from the start, you have an incredible cast of (to me anyway) unknown actors/comedians, the only member I was familiar with was Jon Lajoie. The show has so many great moments, it features a lot of clever musical comedy throughout both series' and it is full of shocking and hilarious antics as the main characters all battle, far too seriously, for their fantasy football league trophy. One of the best things about the show, for me, is that about half of it is completely improvised, this is something I really respect and it makes it much more original than the predictable 'Gary Unmarried's of this word. I also recently discovered the cast and the director all actually play in a fantasy football league of their own; just a little fun fact. Anyway, to summarise; The League is the funniest sitcom around at the moment and if you haven't watched it yet, you're missing out 10/10, a must see!",2011
10,"The premise of the show is rather mundane, but the execution of the humor is more than satisfactory. This show feels more like an internet series, yet that very same, raw, atmosphere helps develop the characters and the plot.",2011

1,Spoiler Alert! ,2014
7,"'The League' gained inspiration from 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' (like most shows that strive to simulate realistic humor while incorporating celebrities in an unconventional manner) as well as 'It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia' (in terms of visual style, cast and breed of humor) though the scenes are not as seamlessly integrated as the former while the humor is sharper than the latter. ",2011
1,"This is quite possibly the worst show on TV. Right after FX's utterly brilliant It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia, this comes on. It is a show about a gang of completely unlikeable douches where one guy is douchier than the next. The script is beyond awful, there are no real funny moments at all, and in the end you are just left wanting to punch the cast in the face. Again, I guess it bottles down to the writing. Except for the ever horrible Mark Duplass, the cast actually does good in other things (like Nick Kroll's great job in The Life & Times of Tim). However, as is, this is unwatchable garbage. I'm sorry FX, I know you wanted this to be another hit like Sunny, but it's just dreadful. Cancel ASAP please. If not, the only way of saving it would be through removing Mark Duplass and bringing in new writers, sacking the old ones).",2012
1,"I can't understand how The League made it past the pilot. It's got to be the most infantile, unfunny show I've ever seen. I love It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia, with its crazy episodes: the U-Haul road trip, the Mexican home makeover, the P Diddy shrimping boat. That show can be low-brow and far out, but it's extremely well done and the cast is excellent.",2015
1,"Cheap script + a few one-liners + sex scenes = the league.... I'm seeing a trend... As America's education get's worse, shows like this start popping up more and more. So sad. There's no talent behind this show. It's just awful. It really takes a special type of person to watch this show and think it's funny. This is just another awful show with poorly written scripts. Almost every episode has a sex scene or some graphic description of sex. Unfortunately, this is one the main reasons why people are attracted to the show. If you're looking for a creative script, watch always sunny. I don't see this show going past a third season. At least I hope it doesn't, for America's sake.",2011
3,last nights double episode including the season finally where horrible.,2012
10,"I'm not a huge football fan, but i never miss an episode of the league. I'd imagine its even better if you actually have a clue about the constant football guest stars but its obvious this show is less about the lineups as it is the shameless unrestrained competition that makes the entire show so damn hilarious. The cast is constantly messing with each other, cracking jokes and busting each others balls. The amount of hilarious, uniquely eccentric characters in the show is par to that of scrubs or chuck, there's really never a dull moment. The episodes usually end with some awkward or completely ridiculous moment, such as Ruxin's dads vinegar strokes, being chased by a dildo trident, etc. ",2013
8,"As my summary name states I am a non American leaving in a far distant country having no clue what so ever on the American Football world. I do now the glimpse of the passion and the love for game, and this series brings the intense love for Football into a funny and wacky way that's a joy. ",2011

10,"I have to admit that if you are a serious person and don't have your own set of inside jokes among your friends then this show is not for you. The League has some of the most memorable terms of any show I ever watched. You don't have to know anything about football to enjoy the show but if you are a big fantasy football fan like I am then this show will be even funnier and make even more sense to you. It's obvious to tell that a lot of the dialog is improvised and very natural. I can basically see myself doing some of the things they do in the show for my love of fantasy football, but yes of course some of the stuff they do is way too crazy, but it is a show after all. It gives a perfect blend of over the top humor, with how fantasy football fans conduct themselves during the season. MUST WATCH show. Never had I laughed so hard, especially seasons 3 and 4. Starting season 3 the jokes are amped up even more and are simply amazing. I can't wait for season 5 to start.",2013
7,"Fast and Furious, or 4 Fast 4 Furious if you're keeping count, is a movie you can basically sum up in one sentence. Muscle guys, muscle cars, hot chicks, and incredible action sequences. Not much has changed in the four films other than who the muscle guys wind up being played by but nonetheless, if you're going to the movies strictly to continually watch these things, then not only will this series run forever, but you should have no problem sitting through this fourth flick. Of course the other thing to look at here is the resurrection of Vin Diesel's action star persona, and considering he's been doing movies like ""Babylon AD"" and ""The Pacifier"" for the past couple years, you can basically say this is one of his better performances in a real long time.",2009
7,"I just got back from the midnight screening of 'Fast & Furious' and I have to admit the movie very much exceeded my fairly low expectations for the film. While the original film was entertaining, it was never a good movie by any means. Let's not even get started on the two that followed. The fourth installment however, is another story. Most of the original cast has come back and seeing them back in action together really makes you realize the F&F franchise isn't the same without them. The chemistry between the three leads (Diesel, Walker and Brewster) is the strongest it's been yet, and I would dare to call several of the scenes 'moving' as a result. Who would have ever expected that from Fast & Furious.",2009
7,"This might bring the audience a lot of questions about the return of the characters Brian O'Connor and specially Han Seoul-Oh after the events in The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift. Fast & Furious is the sequel to the previous films 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003), followed by The Fast And The Furious (2001) and the prequel to The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006).",2013
8,"Brian O'Conner is now working for the FBI on a thin leash, with no room for error. When Dom finds out that Letty was murdered, he sets all his morals aside to catch the people responsible. Not only that, but Dom is forced to accept help from the man who betrayed his trust, Brian O'Conner. I've seen this movie three times now, and it never fails to entertain me. After two sequels that weren't up to par with the first movie, they went all out to make sure this franchise was back on track. What better way to revitalize the series than with the return of Vin Diesel. He had a brief cameo at the end of Tokyo Drift, but this was his first movie since the first. I wouldn't call the plot fantastic or anything, but it definitely has more story to it than usual (IMO).The stakes are much higher emotionally. There are some legitimately good twists and turns in this movie as well. But we all know why we watch these movies, the action. Let me just say that they won't disappoint you. There are some exhilarating action sequences in this movie that don't give you time to breath. The opening scene is spectacular and the finale is excellent as well. It keeps the formula of fast cars, hot women, hunky guys, and rap music. I do have to say the action looked far more professional, continuing this trend in 5 & 6. My only carp about the action, is some shaky camera work at times. This is especially noticeable during an exciting foot race between Walker and a criminal. The performances won't win any Oscars, but they are a lot of fun to watch. Paul Walker's maturity shows as an actor at this juncture. He always had presence, but his performance is rock solid in this one. Vin Diesel isn't that great at emotion. He doesn't really do much when it comes to Letty's death like he should have, but he has plenty of charisma and screen presence. It was fun to see him paired with Walker once again. That p******s called Corona that you drink has gotta go though, bro. Craft beer is much tastier. Jordana Brewster does fine with what she had to do, but I felt her storyline with Walker wasn't explored enough. Michelle Rodriguez plays her part adequately as Letty. She had a jail term to serve, so I imagine that's why she was killed off. The villains are pretty weak in this one. They weren't that menacing in my opinion. The ending does a great job of jerking emotions from you. I have to give it credit",2014
8,"This movie had in from first moment, I loved the start of Second movie but the start this incredible. ",2013
9,"Fast and Furious was a very good movie that had a darker and more serious tone than any of the prior films in the franchise. I loved seeing almost the entire original cast return and the amazing cars and impressive special effects that are a staple of the series return once again... granted, with a reduced emphasis on the cars themselves. The only real problem I had was that the continuity was broken a bit. *SPOILERS* Why, for example, is Paul Walker back in LA after the ending of 2 Fast 2 Furious? What happened to Tyrese's character? What happened to the rest of the crew from the original movie? These are not huge complaints but they did take away from the experience a bit. It's also evident that this film is a prequel to Tokyo Drift which was a little weird. Nonetheless, great film that is probably better than any of the prior ones other than the first of course.",2013
7,"I loved ""The Fast and The Furious."" Cars, ladies, cheesy lines and acting, crazy action = a groovy mix! Fast forward a few years and we finally have ""Fast & Furious""- the first true sequel! So much nostalgia! Seeing Vin, Paul, Michelle, and Jordana together again was fantastic! You can tell that these characters have grown since the first film. Brian is working on a case with the FBI that brings him in collision with Dom, who is back in the states seeking revenge for the murder of his gal Letty. This entry is definitely a bit heavy compared to the first few but that doesn't mean there isn't fun to be had! The opening sequence and the race at the middle of the film are two highlights! The tunnel sequences were not as good though, CGI being one of the reasons- still enjoyed it though! ",2013
9,"I was reading an article in a truckers' trade magazine,about how the druggies would load up some muscle cars in a 53' box trailer and smuggle these cars into Mexico. Then load up these cars with dope. Then, as they were headed to the border to smuggle the drugs into the U.S.; they would use some kinda jamming or cloaking device so the border agents cant detect them,as the cars drive through a tunnel under the border patrols noses. Im wondering,"" How much does the truck driver make?""",2012
7,"So what is Fast and Furious? It's not a remake, or a reboot, and although it would appear to be a sequel it really is ultimately a recap to the very first film...or the second I forget. It has been so long since I've seen the original two films which this one is a direct follow up to. I kind of wish I had watched the first two before seeing this because it may have helped with the overall characters and plot. They do still try to link together not just the first two films but all the movies which I give them kudos for because I actually thoroughly enjoyed Tokyo Drift. So here comes Fast and Furious, barely changing the title from the first one but bringing back the original cast that defined the series. The thing that caught me the most about this film is it is not about car racing anymore. Really the film is about drug trafficking and despite a huge car/truck stunt in the first scene Fast and Furious lacks much of anything fast at all. All the other installments of the series have focused on the cars and the sexy sleek speed of everything but Fast and Furious tries to turn that around by giving it a different edge.",2009
9,"Fast & Furious (2009) is an awesome Action packed sequel, where The Fast and the Furious (2001) stopped. This is the real sequel to The Fast and The Furious. I love that Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster reprise their roles back to the roots the way they were. This is my fourth favorite best film in the series, this film Is a seat to the edge from the beginning till the end. This movie kept me thoroughly entertained from beginning to end. Sure it's a little far fetched, but who cares? It's a movie, and definitely not as bad as some people are saying. Besides, the point of watching a movie is to escape reality so I don't understand why people complain when movies are not realistic. Provided a cinematic equivalent of NOS to the franchise with a tone shift that helped make it one of the most popular and profitable action series in the last decade. Excellent flick. Much better than the middle two. Just forget those movies happened. This was good balls to the walls action with much better actors with the original 4 back together. Bad idea making 2 and 3 :) ",2015
10,"I was honestly so happy when this movie happened. I am a huge fan of The Fast And The Furious, and sadly, 2 Fast 2 Furious and The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift, did not meet my expectations.

7,"Fast and Furious is, in my opinion one of the high points of the Fast franchise. I could enjoy The Fast and the Furious for what it was. 2 Fast 2 Furious I could not really get into despite the awesome races. Fast and Furious is where I started to like and get into the franchise. There are many reasons for why this is.",2015
7,"After two films that strayed away from the very first that made the franchise popular, producers to The Fast and the Furious (2001) decided to finally bring back the original cast and big name stars. That was one of their best decisions that have been made. It's baffling to why they thought changing the cast would really benefit them in any way. All it does is create resent and a disconnect with the new characters. Fans don't appreciate that. However, this is not the only difference brought to this ongoing series. The original cast returns but the story changes. Oh yes, there's still an abundance racing cars but it's for a different reason.",2014

The film begins at such a high octane level that it gets you hooked on almost instantly. The director of the film and director of action do a stunning job of co-ordinating the action sequences brilliantly. The stunning cinematography also adds to the effect. Vin Diesel is the man that makes this series what it is. He is absolutely outstanding. His perfect partner in crime, Paul Walker, is no less. He is cool and effortless.The rest of the cast does good as well. All in all, a must watch.",2014
9,A couple of nights ago I just got done watching F&F Tokyo Drift.....I wish they would've left that one out of this magnificent series. It made ZERO sense that they would do a sequel without any of the main people from the previous movie. I gave that one a rating 6 out of 10 and I was probably being too nice.,2014
7,Towards the end of Tokyo Drift (2006) we saw a Vin Diesel returning. People were eager to wait if he really was coming back and he finally did here in number 4.

I'm sure this had something to do with Justin Lin directing Tokyo Drift as well as Fast & Furious. I'm glad that he made it happen that way because I am sure there were many people that saw Tokyo Drift and thought, ""Where did this movie come from?"" It was so random to have it be a Fast and Furious movie when it had nothing to do with either of the original 2 with the exception of the again, random, cameo of Dom at the end of it. In the first couple of scenes of Fast & Furious you see that Han is part of Dom's crew that hi-jacks gas tankers in the Dominican Republic. When the heat is on Dom once again, he tells Han it's time to go do his own thing. Han tells him that he hears of some things going on in Tokyo. If you recall in Tokyo drift, Han tells Sean that Tokyo is his ""Mexico"" he was running to stay out of jail.",2009

A little hard to follow at times, and the directing isn't that good (like a Michael Bay film, it's very choppy.. the director never stays on one scene). The acting was pretty good, and like usual, Vin Deisel is badass. The plot is kind of realistic, which is a plus. If someone else had of directed the movie, then it would definitely be much better. Don't watch the movie if you epilepsy, because you'll be having seizures.. It's also very loud at times, but car racing movies SHOULD be loud. Good use of Dolby Digital surround sound...",2009
8,"Fast & Furious shows originality far beyond it's title, enough to put it on top of the series with the first. 2F2F was a decent sequel, but definitely was not an ending point. TD was funny, entertaining, and gripping, but once again was not a good ending point for the series. F&F was a GREAT addition to the series. Enough girls, plenty of fast cars, some good one-liners, good action, awesome driving, great stunts, and an awesome cast. This one had more than enough badass-ery to satisfy me. Overall, I went in expecting something like TD, but came out amazed. Any fan of the series will absolutely love F&F!",2009

8,"This was a good movie. They were able to bring back all the things that made the first one great like Vin Diesel, Jordana Brewster, and Paul Walker, and let go of the things that did not work so well. All the things that you loved in the first one are here and a little more. Vin Diesel does a great job from start to finish. In parts of the movie it almost makes you want to leave your seat and cheer. For all you Paul Walker haters out there he did a good job as well. He is like a backup quarterback in the NFL you want him to manage the game don't try to do to much just do what is takes to win. Walker is not the star of the movie, but behind the star he manages his part well. He does a good job of playing his part and not going beyond that and try to make a great performance. Walker acts within his ability. I for one am not a Walker hater so I never felt like he did a bad job, but I know there are a lot of you out there and you will be happy with his performance in this movie. Just the right blind of action and cars. For all the people that loved Han from Tokyo Drift don't get really excited, his role is only for about 3 minutes at the beginning of the movie. This is not a movie that is going to win any Academy Awards, but it is a movie that will keep you entertain for an hour and forty five minutes. Worth the movie to pay to see this one in the theater. Which is saying a lot for the way the economy is right now. It is the best one in the series.",2009
8,"Something I often find bothersome in 'time travel fiction' is that there is usually a large chunk of the storytelling dedicated to the tedium of explaining 'how' time travel works, particularly when time travel is merely a device to aid the storytelling. We don't really need to know the science behind it because, simply put, science can neither logically explain its paradoxical nature, nor prove or dispute its possibility. ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" never makes pretenses to the science behind it, rather it centers its focus on the story.",2009

8,"This was much better than expected. The premise seemed far-fetched, to put it mildly. But the movie worked on a number of different levels based on the screenplay, directing, beautiful cinematography, and acting, not just of the always captivating Rachel McAdams, but also the much underrated Eric Bana as the co-lead, and the rest of the supporting cast.",2009

8,"The Time Traveler's Wife is a romantic drama directed by Robert Schwentke, adapted from Audrey Niffenegger's bestseller of the same name. Adapting a novel with complex elements and undertones to the silver screen is a daunting task and director Robert Schwentke struggled to compromise between satisfying readers of the novel and making the movie accessible to people unfamiliar with the book. Overall, the movie has some significant directing and screen writing flaws but does make for an unpretentious and above-average romantic tragedy thanks to its two compelling leads.",2009
9,"I started to watch this just to kill some time. Been nows nothing about it. When i looked at the title, i thought: ""hmm... probably some family-drama movie around time travel. maybe a little sci-fi gives it some fun"". And it's made it so. Of course it's not sci-fi in any terms. If You try to find any science in it You will become really disappointed, to be clear it's looks illogical in many points. Time travel is much more of allegory then the real subject here. But this movie has it's own soul, a rhythm. It can catch You in it, so You will forgive it's flows, or to be accurate, to understand them as they are - a fairy tale. About love and life.",2012

McAdams and Bana are both beautiful and amazing in Director Robert Schwentke's ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" based on the bestselling novel by Audrey Niffenegger. ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" adapted by screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin is a bitter sweet and strange love story. It is not perfect; although, it ends perfectly. There is a timeless and yearning quality that engages in ""The Time Traveler's Wife"". However, Schwentke and Rubin might have leveraged sharper emotional arcs at particular narrative points. During the course of their lives, Clare and Henry experience tragedy and joy. In spite of this, Rachel McAdams is stunning. I am in love with her. Bana is powerful and moving.",2009

8,"The Time Traveler's Wife is based off of one of the best books I've read in recent years. Naturally, the movie couldn't come close to catching all the little details that made the book so captivating, since like any other film it had a limited time frame he had to work with. However, the Hollywood adaptation (with Eric Bana and Rachel McAdams as the lead rolls) did do one thing right: it captured the heart of the novel and transferred much of the book's atmosphere to the big screen. Now, as much as I've always hated those original-material purists who nitpick on every little detail in a given adaptation, I have to say the work done on The Time Traveler's Wife was extraordinary loyal in spirit to the film.",2009
1,"The basic theme is difficult (uncontrollable time-travelling)but not contemptible. However sci-fi themes need an internal logic and consistency if they are to be intelligible and to any extent convincing and this muddled film had none. The hero kept popping backwards and forwards without rhyme or reason and to no real purpose, sometimes reporting on or remembering what he had seen, sometimes not,and always naked for some reason (the clothes dropped in a pile as he left -- presumably the atoms of his body could be transported through the dimension but not the atoms of his clothes!) The early scene where he at about age 35 appears from the future to comfort himself aged three after a road traffic accident is ridiculous and makes no sense. Why he doesn't recognise his future wife when she speaks to him in the library is inexplicable, bearing in mind he has often visited her from the future when she was a child. Then his final demise is totally unexplained. He disappears once more into the future,gets shot by mistake (was it by his father-in-law?) in an icy forest, and returns -- this is the daftest bit of all -- to die of his wounds in what I take to be the present. This doesn't stop him from whizzing back (or do I mean forward) from time to time thereafter to say hello to his loved ones. All in all, the film is totally confused and confusing; the makers don't appear to have thought anything through with even a semblance of logic and clearly have no real idea what they are trying to say. I wonder if the book was any better.",2011
1,I simply can't understand why this film has received so many good reviews. I watched the film on the strength of the comments left on these very pages as IMDb is usually a reliable place to check to see if I'll be wasting my time and money or not. Oh how I feel let down.,2010
1,"There seem to be two reasons why some people rave about a truly dumb movie like this: 1) they're fans of the book on which it was based, so the movie completes a personal loop for them; and 2) it's a so-called ""love story.""",2011
1,"I'm a real sucker for romantic movies and might be the only guy hanging on to his handkerchief in most; but not this one. TTW is void of any genuine emotion, primarily because the story is so silly and they contrive nonsense like having the time traveler go back in time and talk with his own self. ",2010
7,"Henry (Eric Bana) meets Clare (Rachel McAdams) in a library in Chicago as they both know that he has a genetic disorder that causes him to time travel, but she knows much more than that about him as she has met him many times before. He has not yet been to the times and places where they have met before. He then falls in love with her, as she was already in love with him since she was six years old. His continuous absences with time traveling and returning knowing more and more about their future, makes their relationship very challenging. The continuous absence also worries Clare more and more every day as she fells alone in their marriage and their life together.",2012
3,"While the concept of 'The Time Traveler's Wife' appears pretty clever, the actual execution proves quite inept. Eric Bana is Henry DeTamble, a Chicago librarian, who has some kind of genetic mutation which causes him to skip around in time. The twist is that every time he jumps in time, he loses his clothes. You might think that the image of the naked Henry scrambling around for new duds as he appears in different eras might have the potential for some neat comic possibilities—but humorless director Robert Schwentke opts for a completely heavy-handed, serious approach.",2010
1,"This film started off well but went absolutely no where! At times it threatened to get interesting by dropping hints of a twist in the plot but it lacked the guts to follow it through. The film was linear and predictable, at no point did I feel my emotions change. The plot had more loops in it than a sieve and made no effort to explain anything in depth. The acting was also poor, but given the quality of material there was to work with I doubt anyone could have made it better. Time travel is an amazing ability, you would have thought the writers would have been more creative about the possibilities it could afford a character.",2010
6,"As a stand-alone creature, *The Time Traveler's Wife* is a nice love story about a nice couple struggling with an unusual difficulty. The actors do a fine job with the material they were given, but unfortunately, what they were given was a pale shadow of the original tale. The original tale was fleshed out with much stronger plot points, subtexts and symbolism, with supporting characters who had a real role to play in the progression of the plot. Several of these have been jettisoned completely, others are there for reasons that really make no sense other than to be ""couple friends."" (For example, the character crucial to the ending in the book is only alluded to and not in the context of the ending.) The whole reason for the ending was completely glossed over (to say more gives away an important novel plot point), the intensity of the struggles the couple faces are barely evident, and their motivations (driven by some of those very same supporting characters) are unclear. Obviously one can only fit so much of such a dense work into a two-hour feature, but there are other ways this could be done without making the story a superficial shadow of its former self. Hour-long TV dramas do a better job of providing this kind of writing, characterization, and directing (even those that are not serialized). Furthermore, while the novel gives us a range of characters with whom to identify in a very complex and surreal conceit, the movie only gives us the central two characters, which means if you don't identify with them, you're not going to enjoy the movie. On the other hand, if you do, and if you haven't read the novel, you may enjoy the story as a superficial love story with a clichéd ending. Novel lovers, beware, a key scene, the one that ties everything together at the end of the story, is completely missing, and that was, to me, the greatest loss, as it actually went to the heart of the love story itself.",2010
5,"Some professional reviewers are picking this as one of the worst movies of the year, but although I don't think it's the greatest movie ever made I certainly don't feel it deserves that connotation. This is basically a straight forward romance story twisted around the fact that the man time travels uncontrollably to different points in his life and is somehow intertwined with a woman who knows of his problem and seemingly has no control over eventually being with him. It is a bit confusing as to why he can be in the same place as two different versions of himself. They have a child who time travels also but I guess she didn't do it until she was able to understand it and pick locks? Why didn't she and her father both time travel when they were babies? There is absolutely no explanation of why he does this or why he can't change things even though he does them over and over. The creepiest part is the fact that he starts a adult relationship with a 8 year old girl after he is naked in a field and this is all presented as normal. This is an interesting film with major flaws and the one fact is that nothing really happens throughout.",2010
5,"This movie was disappointing, not because of the two gorgeous, touching stars or the cinematography, but the story's fantasy premise has so many flaws, so many inconsistencies that it collapses, making the whole affair rather pointless, in my opinion. So, go with caution, those of you who love romance or the two main cast members, for you may be satisfied with these elements. The storyline features a gentleman, Henry (Eric Bana), who, as a child, escaped from an horrific car accident by ""time traveling"" to a different place. The crash, however, killed his mother and drove his father to alcoholism. Continuing to travel throughout his life to different time periods and places, he finds himself in a meadow one day, where a beautiful little girl is preparing a picnic. She will grow up to be Claire (Rachel McAdams) and become the wife of the time traveler. Meeting again at a college library, as adults, the two fall desperately in love and marry, but, complications are always present. Claire, a budding artist, is often left to spend holidays alone and worries constantly, for Henry sometimes travels into dangerous neighborhoods and situations. Then, longing for a child, the couple experiences acute disappointment time again through miscarriage. Although Henry uses his abilities to purchase a winning lottery ticket that buys them a lovely home and art studio, will they ever be truly happy? And, what about strong indications that Henry will die in his early forties, in a violent way? As stated above, there are elements to admire about this film. The two stars, Bana and McAdams, are attractive, talented actors who work very hard to make the film a success. Also, the lesser cast members, including Ron Livingston and Arliss Howard, do fine work as well. Then, too, the scenery is lovely, from beautiful meadow to stately mansion and back again. Costumes and camera work are of the finest. It is, unfortunately, the story that is wanting and since it was a book first, which I did not read yet, this reviewer does not know if critical issues were left out that would have made a more sensible story. For example, Henry always travels ""nude"", leaving a pile of clothes when he departs and arriving naked at his next venue, causing him to have to steal the first available clothing. Why is this so? Can't clothes travel too? In addition, questions about why he can travel to his own wedding, nearly on time, but have no control over other episodes is puzzling and that's just the start of a long list of inconsistencies. Because fantasy relies on a set of ground rules to be successful, in my opinion, this one doesn't work for me. The direction, too, is tentative and the flick has many slowly moving scenes. In summary, if you love romance first and foremost, you will probably want to see this film. All others, however, should ponder awhile about plunking down ten bucks for a ticket, when it might be better to wait for the DVD or other low cost alternatives.",2009
3,"I really don't understand what's so good about this movie or the book. The guy travels through time. What for? why? Does it add anything to his character? Does he do anything special while traveling? He spoils the surprise of miracles in life to his wife and his daughter. He lives absolutely worthless life. I would understand if he was some sort of hero. He never works, never helps anyone, cheats in the lottery... And he dies as a jerk, by mistake. All his life is just a huge mistake.",2010
8,"This was a difficult concept to bring off successfully, but they got it done (& did a bunch of filming for it in the CHICAGO area). ERIC BANA plays Henry, the boy & man who keeps flitting back & forth in time. He meets a young girl Clare (RACHEL McADAMS) to whom he tries to explain that he will end up MARRYING her later in her life. Since the story does not go chronologically, instead traveling to changing points both ahead and back in time, it requires concentration to clearly follow just ""where"" Eric is in his time & level of relationship with Rachel & her friend Gomez (RON LIVINGSTON) & their various family members. It's a fascinating and at-times FRUSTRATING experience for the characters, because they're never fully sure just when things may ""change"" for them & him (&, as he says, at times, he's in ""competition"" with HIMSELF). Eric & Rachel keep trying to have a child, & everyone wonders if that child will ALSO turn out to be someone who can (& will) travel forwards & backwards in time. The acting is very good & believable, the relationships are warm & caring, & I think you'll enjoy what they've created.",2009
8,"I'll admit that after reading some early remarks about Robert Schwentke's cinematic version I was very worried, in fact so much so that my expectations were somewhat low. This fact might have weighed on my ultimate decision concerning my enjoyment in seeing the DeTamble family's story on screen because I actually really bought in and was swept away for the journey. Yes, a lot, (and I do mean a lot), is omitted through the adaptation process of Oscar-winner Bruce Joel Rubin, but enough is kept to stay true to that romantic tone. Distilled down and perhaps dumbed-down, The Time Traveler's Wife may lose some of its geeky sci-fi flavor, but the heart and soul remains intact to be a solid date movie and entry to the romance drama genre.",2009
6,"I could tell from the trailers that if you were not a committed Will Ferrell fan, or stoned out of your mind, that this movie would probably be trashed by the experts. You either find his absurd comedy funny or find it a senseless insult to your intelligence. For me, there were a couple times when I really laughed out loud (and I was sober as a judge), most of the time I simply had a smile on my face as I watched the master make a complete fool of himself - which is what Will Ferrell does. I read some of these in-depth critiques in utter amazement. I mean, really, what were you expecting to see? It is a very light hearted spoof of one of the most ridiculous TV series in history. Generally, I thought it was funny, we've been repeating some of the funnier, albeit, totally ridiculous scenes all day. I do strongly caution parents with children. When Will Ferrell says PG-13 he isn't kidding. Sexual innuendo and drug references are going to be quite uncomfortable for the prudish crowd.",2009
8,"This movie is definitely better then most of the reviews on this page have been saying. From reading the comments it seems like it is mostly due to parents bringing their kids to see a movie including an actor from movies such as Old School and Anchorman and getting mad when they see crude humor. If you like Will Ferrell you will like most jokes in this movie, it is very funny and in my opinion close to The Hangover. This movie is not supposed to be taken seriously and as long as you don't try to compare it to the original show and go along with it you will laugh. Go in with an open mind and don't listen to the critics this movie is for sure worth checking out.",2009

This maybe why it was so poorly received.",2009
7,"I really enjoyed this movie; I think it might be the best Ferrell movie I've seen in a while. Yes it's goofy and silly, but I think a lot of the negative reviewers here are people who were fans of the original and are judging thru the haze of nostalgia. The original was every bit as goofy and ridiculous, it's just that this movie has the good sense to acknowledge it. And yes, it may not be appropriate for very young viewers as there is some sexual innuendo and cursing, but it does have a PG-13 rating so I don't know why you would be dragging young children to it anyways...",2009
8,"First I must state that I am NO fan of Will Ferrell. Outside of his SNL days of doing a dead-on spoof of Bush, Ferrell hasn't made a movie that I wanted to see. After reading these reviews I was even more set on avoiding it. However, I decided to suffer thru it for my sis's birthday. To my surprise, we laughed quite a lot at the sweet goofiness of this movie. I agree that they could have cut out the useless mature sights and words that left the kids out because it would have appealed to them. We particularly loved the scenes between Farrell and the obviously more intelligent Dino. Danny McBride was sweetly silly too. The female actress was okay as eye candy for the guys. All the criticism on this site is for people who place stock on what others have to say. Happy to say, we avoided these critics. By the way, if you hated the movie so much, why spend so much of your time to write such long-winded diatribes??? Seems to me these are people who need to feel a sense of importance that they don't have. Oh well, the movie goer should always make up their own minds. We did, and I'm happy to say it turned out well. We really laughed!! And my sister is not one to laugh easily. I just wish they wouldn't show so much of the sight gags in the commercials for the movie. But don't let that keep you away. There's more context for the funny parts in the movie.",2009

I thought Love Actually was one of the worst films I ever saw but I would give it at least a 3. All I'm asking for is abit of consistency take a look at another film I really hated - Crank high voltage 2 rated above 6 how are these scores accurate?? you're telling me that crank is funnier than this film...I can't accept this, so here I am I've signed up at IMDb because of the unfair ratings this film is getting.",2009

We went into the theater having heard all the negative reviews, expecting a horrible film. Glad we ignored the critics. It doesn't deserve the rap it's getting and if this is the movie Sid and Marty wanted then that's fine with us. It's their creation and we enjoyed their take on it. I can't help but think that a more serious treatment might have been more pleasing to hard-core fans like us but a film has to span the masses so we understand the direction they went.

4,"""Land of the Lost"" is another in a long line of old TV shows lazily packaged into summer movies, too dumbed-down for fans of the original show and nothing all that memorable for those younger viewers coming into it for the first time.

I can't believe millions of dollars was spent making this piece of garbage...the jokes are not funny,the acting is reaching for something in every scene and they just move on like nothing happened...Like we the audience are so brain dead that we wouldn't know any better.

Implausible, awful, terrible acting, terribly written -- you're lucky you can find a single half-a-laugh in this boring nonsensical piece of garbage. There is not an ounce of creativity here. I'm not sure what Will Farrel was thinking - he's generally funny and picks some well written scripts. This was simply unbearable. What's most disappointing is that if you are an old fan of the show (like myself) this just takes what was somewhat of a real live adventure (and the whole idea of escaping the land of the lost) and turns it in to a silly goofy series of the worst sight gags I have ever seen. How easy is it to throw Slee Staks and dinosaurs over garbage? This film is proof that it's pretty easy indeed. Maybe this is some new Hollywoood formula - a giant CGI dinosaur and nothing else. I am tempted to list the ridiculous additions to the original show. Instead, I'll just say they were subtractions and not additions. Not to mention the fact that every set looked like the inside of a bad Disney ride. Don't waste your money - I wouldn't even recommend this for free. One final warning - if you take your kids you'll have to get past the dozen or so raunchy necessary sexual jokes - none of which are funny at all.",2009

Did you know a guy in high school who tried soooooo hard to be cool but failed at every turn? If so you know the Ferell character. He's not cool, he's not smart, he not funny, heck he's not even sympathetic, he's just there, taking up space in this movie and once again proving that he's a talent-less hack who managed to get in on Saturday Night Live as it was in the downward spiral and is cashing is at every turn.

She seemed to be out of place, if that could be possible in such a ""modge podge"" of the ridiculous. The plot was so random, and it really had nothing to do with the original series; things like sleestacks, dinosaurs, and banjo music were just kind of thrown in with no rhyme or reason. I had really looked forward to this movie since I'd liked the 70""s Saturday morning series as a kid. I thought Will Ferrell would make it funny - I loved him in Elf - but that wasn't the case.

This movie didn't just stink - it wreaked!!! Bad acting. Bad graphics/special effects. Stupid humor aimed at warped Jr High age boys, e.g., monkey man ""cha-ka"" grabbing Holly's breast.

1,"Maybe the problem is that Will Ferrell should be making movies that are serious since he is reasonably attractive. Wait, maybe this movie was serious because it sure wasn't funny. Come with low expectations and you won't be disappointed. There are some special effects pulled from old movies that are no longer special. The backdrop that the actors wander through is a wasteland of time and space and so like the story line, empty and pointless. The idea of an outsider scientist coming up with a real breakthrough and falling into an unexplored world could go dozens of different ways. Hollywood is letting us down with these bland scripts. It's letting the actors down too. Will Ferrell has potential which has never been realized in any movie so far. I'd like to see him doing what he did as a SNL star, just be funny. I saw the preview of this movie and said I was going to give it a chance. Now I wish I'd saved my money for something else.",2009

Will you have done it again by screwing up a movie. Somebody get him the ???? out of movies. Jerry Lewis is a comedian. Jeff Dunham a funny funny man. Will Farrel not a comedian, not an actor!! I highly don't recommend seeing any of his movies!! There have been a lot of good actors out of Saturday Night Live Eddy Murphy, Chevy Chase just to name a few.

Maybe I'm too undereducated to get it's jokes, but I don't remember many. My bride has fallen asleep after 10 minutes, and I watched the movie in complete silence and agony, and wondered why am I doing this anyway. Will Ferrel is too weak to lift this lame picture off the ground. He can be somewhat good if he is well directed, but it's not the case here. I'm usually not expecting much from a comedy, and if one of them gives me five good laughs over 90 minutes, then I feel satisfied, but this movie failed to achieve even this small task. ",2010

Yes, some parts are mind-numbingly stupid, but most of them still get a laugh. It's definitely McBrides and Ferrels improvisation that made the movie though. Personally, I love Mcbrides type of humor/acting. It's absolutely hilarious to me. I have seen the movie twice and wouldn't mind seeing it again. Honestly, if you liked Hot Rod, or have seen Eastbound and Down, or Old School, or any of those type of comedies, you will enjoy this movie. Just go into it with the expectations of stupid jokes, and nasty one-liners, and I guarantee you won't be disappointed.",2009
5,"Having never seen an episode of Land of the Lost, it is hard to judge the film as anything other than the next entry into the hall of zany Will Ferrell comedies. He plays Dr. Rick Marshall, a scientist laughed off the Today show for his theories regarding alternate dimensions and periods of time flux. A few years later, a budding doctorate student named Holly (Anna Friel) convinces him to continue his research into the idea, and going on a hunch inside a grimy water trail lead by the obnoxious Will (Danny McBride). Sure enough, the group end up in a totally different time where dinosaurs roam amongst ape/human hybrids and creatures referred to as Sleestaks.",2009
10,"As a young female twenty-something, my 90's childhood was shaped by the Golden Age of Disney. Every year, there would be a new masterpiece for my mom to take me to; Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, Aladdin ... And when Disney failed so terribly in the early millennium and closed down shop, my heart was broken. There was a part of our culture and my life that my little girl I someday hope to have was never going to be able to experience, and I was never going to get back.",2009
8,Wow. That's one word to sum up everything about this movie: Wow.,2009
9,"Michael Eisner will forever be known as the man that attempted to totally kill Disney animation. After the disastrous efforts of Home on the Range, what was once a staple of the Walt Disney Company was becoming a thing of the past. Traditional animation was dead in Disney, and this was definitely one of the major contributors towards the shift in upper-upper management and his departure. Now with Pixar and John Lasseter on board, Disney pulls absolutely no punches in their return to tradition. There's a new princess, she happens to be black, and they happen to twist a classic story so much that you have literally no clue in which direction the writers were going. The major question is: can Disney revive its Renaissance quality that it experienced in the 90s? Can they ever duplicate such magic again? The answer is a resounding yes. ",2009
10,"Just astounding. The story was genuinely touching, the intense scenes jumped out at you, the humor was funny, the acting was excellent, and the music was the best soundtrack of any Disney movie since The Little Mermaid (A standing ovation for Randy Newman). There is also something about the 2D animation - it just has more personality and emotion than CGI. I just saw it tonight, and I am honestly floored.",2009
9,"I've said my share of disparaging words against the Walt Disney Company, and let's face it; they've put out more than their share of garbage over the years. It seems as if Pixar has been pulling their dead weight for the past decade as they've put out offensively bad DTV releases and pumping their money and resources into their sub par T.V. station and musical acts (though I will say that Lilo and Stitch, as well as The Emperor's New Groove, which I consider to be one of Disney's funniest releases). Yes, it seemed that all hope was lost for the Mouse and that anything original and thought provoking associated with the Disney name would have that cute little bouncing lamp right along side.",2010
10,"I was privileged to attend a showing of The Princess and the Frog last night as part of a special engagement at New York City's Zeigfeld theater. This movie exceeded all expectations. It is visually stunning, musically a work of genius, thematically sophisticated, and story-wise told in a refreshingly different way (some actions are pre-motivation) which makes the ride an unpredictable one. ",2009
9,"The Princess and the Frog is one of the most highly anticipated films of the year. It marks Walt Disney Animation Studio's return to 2D animation, to recapture the era of amazing movies like The Little Mermaid, Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast – timeless tales that have reached audiences across the world. However, unlike these previous movies, The Princess and the Frog does something new. It's an updated take on the classic fairy tale, set in Jazzy New Orleans filled with witch doctors, Maldonian princes, southern lovesick daughters, Jazz playing alligators and even Cajun fireflies! In the midst of all this jazz is Disney's first black princess, Tiana, and her story.",2009
8,"Disney was at its best in the 90s. They came out with such great movies as Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, and The Hunchback of Notre Dame. And then, they made bad movies like Home on the Range. Disney can make good movies, and they usually do. The Princess and the Frog is one of Disney's best movies. It has a great twist on a classic story, characters that made me care, and music that had me tapping my foot and wishing I was in New Orleans. The animation is so beautiful that I literally almost cried at the beginning of the film. Dr. Faciler is probably one of Disney's best villains. Keith David's voice is so creepy and fits perfect into the character. His song ""Friends on the Other Side"" is great and shows just how scary he can be. In most Disney movies, there are usually two or three songs that really stick with you. Every song in this movie was great. I still find myself humming ""Down in New Orleans"" everywhere I go. The bottom line is that Princess and the Frog is one of Disney's best and one of the best films of the year. The only question I can't answer is if it is better than Up. But if I have to answer, I'd say it's equal to it.",2009
9,"With such disappointments as Home on the Range and Chicken Little, Walt Disney Animation Studios – on the whole – has had a pretty rough decade. Last November, however, the Mouse House released Chris Williams and Byron Howards' Bolt, which is not only generally accepted as a return to form for the studio, but over the course of this past year, has usurped Pulp Fiction as my personal favorite movie of all time. With that said, I went into The Princess and the Frog with relatively high expectations; having walked out of the theatre just a couple of hours ago, I have to say that John Musker and Ron Clements' latest - while not overthrowing it - certainly continues the magic of the studio's previous film.",2009
10,"I felt like a little kid again seeing The Princess and the Frog; apparently so did most of the theater, as the crowd seemed to be generally from 8-30 years old. From the second I walked in, I realized this was a movie that was going to span groups(and it did, in the end). The other adults in line with me split almost evenly with tickets for this versus Invictus.",2009
4,"As has been stated elsewhere, here we have an almost traditional Disney animated feature with Pixar nowhere to be found. The question is has Pixar changed the game in this field and is there still room for old 2-D traditional-style animation. Well of course there is but the other thing that Pixar has done is raise the bar where writing is concerned, which is where I think this film falls down. ",2012
5,"'The Princess and the Frog' has had much publicity for being Disney's return to its traditional methods of animation. Because of this simple reason, I bet many folks expected great things from this, mostly fans of old Disney. Well, for fans of Disney films from recent years, this might please them. On the other hand, for traditional Disney supporters, very likely this might be not quite what they expect.",2010
8,"When Toy Story was first unleashed on the scene back in 1995 to resounding success, it was the beginning of the end for traditionally hand drawn animated films. They were a dying breed, and as Pixar picked up steam (and inspired countless rivals), Disney began focusing more on the wave of the future and not of the past. But nostalgia is a funny thing, and can help lead to some of the best ideas. And that is where The Princess and the Frog fits in.",2009
5,"The Princess and the Frog (2009): Dir: Ron Clements, John Musker / Voices: Anika Noni Rose, Bruno Campos, Keith David, Michael-Leon Wooley, Jim Cummings: A disappointing magical tale about the layers of beauty. A Prince is transformed into a frog by a voodoo magician and when waitress Tiana kisses him, she too becomes a frog. Directed by Ron Clements and John Musker who both collaborated on various animated projects including their biggest masterpiece, The Little Mermaid as well as Aladdin and Hercules. They are backed with colorful animation but terrible musical numbers. Anika Noni Rose voices the loyal Tiana who wishes to open her own restaurant. Even as a frog she demonstrates boldness in the face of adversary. Bruno Campos voices the Prince who is inexperienced in nearly everything. We realize that these two are meant to be but the humour counters predictable elements. Keith David has the misfortune of voicing the pathetically cardboard voodoo villain. Michael-Leon Wooley voices a jazz playing alligator. Why he can play music is not explained but his craving is for music, not people. Jim Cummings voices a firefly that fails to light up the screenplay beyond its formula delivery. Although it comes off occasionally corny it does twist the frog princess cliché in a different direction. It just loses the magic that other films had sustained. Score: 5 / 10",2016
5,"In a New Orleans mansion, the housekeeper reads 'The Frog Prince' to her daughter Tiana and rich little Charlotte La Bouff. Tiana would never kiss a frog. As a young woman, she works hard to save money to start her own dream restaurant as envisioned by her late father. Carefree Prince Naveen of Maldonia arrives in New Orleans and hyper Charlotte is so excited. He's looking to marry rich as he has been cut off. Voodoo witch doctor Facilier transforms Naveen into a frog and his valet Lawrence into Naveen. At the party, frog Naveen offers Tiana money to kiss him and she needs the money to open her restaurant. However the kiss transforms her into a frog instead. Frogs Naveen and Tiana escape into the bayou and befriends Louis the alligator and Ray the Cajun firefly. Good voodoo priestess Mama Odie tells them that Naveen must kiss a princess and they go to get a kiss from Charlotte, the princess of the Mardi Gras Parade.",2015
10,"As a native of Louisiana, this film struck a chord that might not happen to natives of other states. The film was gorgeously rendered, and it captured the flair that makes our state so special. Ther were even jokes that only a Louisianian would honestly get. Disney returns with visual flair, quick and witty jokes, and a story. Oh my god, an actual story with meaning. This is not a film that relies on pop culture gags and scatological jokes that so many other animated films seem to rely on. The 2-d animation adds warmth, and it gives you the sense that this was the loving work of a company who takes pride in their work.",2009
5,"Visually this movie looks beautiful, but unfortunately it was a little boring, which is kind of odd for a Disney film. I can look past almost every other hangup I might have with a movie if I am genuinely entertained, but not boredom. Not to say that the entire movie was boring, but enough that I did notice it, and when you get to point in a movie where you don't really care what is going on, well... that pretty much ends it. After seeing it I knew I had no desire to ever see it again even though some aspects were quite good. I know that most Disney movies have their predictable elements, but this movie seemed so by- the-numbers that it never surprised me and never moved outside the box.",2016

8,"It's been awhile since Disney has made either a 2D animated feature or a retelling of a classic fairy tale. So naturally because I'm a big Disney fan, I was looking forward to seeing the 2009 Disney animated feature ""The Princess and the Frog"" for many reasons. Among the reasons were that I preferred 2D animation over 3D animation, it's the first Disney animated feature with an African-American princess, and it was directed by the same talented directors of ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Aladdin"", John Musker and Ron Clements. And right off the bat, I must say that this film did not disappoint. This is the kind of film I wanted to see from Disney for a long time, and I finally got it. ",2013
9,I have wanted to see this film ever since it came out and one of my former classmates from university recommended this as well.,2013
10,"After so many years Disney finally got it right again. ""The Princess and the Frog"" is right up there with the likes of ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""The Lion King"". It may start a little slowly but turns great once Tiana and Naveen get to the swamp. Both are very well-developed characters with Tiana being a great role model. Judging by the trailers I thought Ray the firefly would annoy me but he's actually the most likable character in the movie. The story contains lots of comedy and a heart-warming message. Dr. Facilier is an awesome villain and I wonder if Disney is going to give him further appearances. The songs are catchy and fun with amazing visuals. The traditional animation is basically eye candy. I hope Disney doesn't leave this path.",2013

6,"I think Disney is back in good form with THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG, but what it seems to lack is a a more frightening villain and a better quality of songs. The songs are catchy enough but quite forgettable without a single standout to match the musical numbers in BEAUTY AND THE BEAST or THE LITTLE MERMAID.",2009

I saw it twice in theaters with my family and my brother by ourselves and we loved it as hard-core Disney fans of my favorites (The Lion King, Aladdin, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Mulan, Tarzan, etc). So, are there any flaws in this movie? Well, let's just say that there is one because the end of the movie does get a bit rushed, but it doesn't matter.",2013
9,"This reboot in my opinion is a great horror slasher film from 2009 mostly because of Jared Padalecki. In this reboot from Friday the 13th film series, Jared Padalecki from Supernatural was awesome in this. Both of the actors from Supernatural Jansen Ackles and Jared Padalecki in 2009 were playing in a horror slasher remakes the lead protagonists. Jensen Ackles tried with the film My Blood Valentine 3D playing Tom J. Hanniger the main protagonist. While Jared Padalecki tried his portrayal the protagonist Clay Miller in Friday the 13th (2009). I must say both of the actors did a good job in each horror slasher remakes! I watched both of the movies separately and I loved them. I love Jensen Ackles and I love Jared Padalecki! Jared Padalecki in my opinion did great and a lot better job then Jensen Ackles did in My Bloody Valentine 3D I have enjoyed Friday the 13th movie way better then I did My Bloody Valentine (2009). I seriously think this reboot is great slasher film and miles way better then My Blood Valentine and miles way better than A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010) remake. That movie sucked so much, I hated it.",2017

3,"I didn't expect much of anything other than a few memorable kills and maybe a cheap jump scare here and there. This pathetic excuse for a movie couldn't even deliver that much. For starters, I personally can't stand how recent horror movies are shot. Everything has the same dark, muddy and flat-looking quality, with no real clarity of picture and irritating shakycam going into overdrive during 90 percent of the horror/action scenes because far too many directors today aren't talented enough to stage an effective horror or action scene without it. The gore was often even hard to make out because of the camera-work, too, which renders something like this almost completely pointless. And while the 1980s Friday films aren't what I'd call genre classics, you could at least clearly make out the gory scenes instead of getting a split flash of some CGI effect while the cameraman goes into a seizure. Bah-humbug, I know. But I swear I really did try my best to like this one. Honest!",2009

Of the slew of terms studios use to avoid the word 'remake' I suppose the best term to describe the latest 13th film would be rejuvenation. The series started its downward spiral after part IV and while director Marcus Nipsel's doesn't wipe the slate clean, he ads enough pizazz to make it the best of the series in nearly two decades.",2009

Jason Voorhees had been, literally, scaring the crap out of us for 3 decades now and it has been 5 years since we have seen him last and now to be completely hones; I was not disappointed. It has all the elements of a great scary movie and anyone who says that they don't get at least a little afraid out by the man in the mast it a LIAR! You can see through the movie that some of the deaths have been done before but have a little more twist now and that is just fantastic. I have read what the critics have aid about this movie and to be completely hones; screw em'! Critics never know a good horror movie even if it came an bite them in the ass, literally. They have always looked down upon great horror movies and what do they know?! 3 decades ago when the original Friday the 13th came out, it got horrible reviews and look at it now; it's a cultural classic!

The cheap scares were bumped up, the gore was definitely there, and the sex...well, it wouldn't be a ""Friday the 13th"" movie without the sex. As for Jason's new ""attitude"" if you really wanna call it that, it's a huge plus in my book. He's more bad ass, he's more ruthless and he's definitely more imaginative with his killing 'methods'. I went in expecting another night of jumps and scares, and got just that plus the satisfaction of knowing a classic horror movie icon was finally re-done correctly. Although I hate talking' about scenes in a movie, I have to say that having Jason stick a camper in a sleeping bag and hang them over a roaring fire while they scream for their lives at the top of their lungs...it's a hugely big improvement from his usual hack and slash from his roots, needless to say there is a lot of 2009 showing in this Jason installment.",2009

The new millennium brought us Freddy vs. Jason, awesome movie, I recommend it, but we still needed a re-boot of the iconic monsters. So we have Friday the 13th, what baffles me is why the title is same of the 1980 film that was a great slumber party movie. This could have been a lot more better if it had worked as a sequel rather than a re-make. Now, don't get me wrong, I felt that this was actually a fun horror movie, the fans get what they want with the blood, gore and sex.

Not that it matters much, because no one is even slightly likable. They are all pathetic stereotypes that are more idiotic than the original characters. By the way, it was so laughable the way Jason held the girl because she resembled his mother. Seriously, unless you want to see a classic horror film destroyed, skip it, or if you must see it, catch it for free on TV. I was hoping this would at least have some good scares, but I was let down.

Almost every aspect of dragonball was changed and i saw little to no representation of the character's true personalities. I went to the movie hoping, no praying for a halfway decent film, all i saw were some decent effects. The only thing that resembles dragonball were the dragonballs and the names of the characters. Every copy of this movie should be destroyed and i will try my best to erase its disturbing images from my mind.",2009
1,"The entire assembly of the film crew and casting is WRONG (excluding the catering and the grip and electric guys). Asia has the first priority to watch such a bad film done by JAMES WONG. Why is he still getting work from Hollywood anyway? ""The One"" was badly done and James is just the worse director ever, I tell ya, he is walking on thin ice in the film industry. He has absolutely no vision of this film. Who hired him anyway? This film is so amateur done that it looks like student film. I can't believe 20th Century Fox distribute a student film worldwide. Btw, did they just put Stehpen Chow's name as the producer as a marketing strategy for Asia? The film ended with a hint of a sequel, and if it does, it will most likely end up re-shooting the entire film (remember of The Hulk). King Piccolo lacks of drive for him to destroy the world. Plot is flat, character drives are lame. Dialogs are stereotype. Ben Ramsey did a poor job as a screenwriter, he is lack of experience to write such an epic movie.",2009

Copying Uwe Boll too much? Whoever gave the changes in this movie a green-light was damn stupid. The whole thing's cliché, and relies again on the ""Heroes Journey"".

But in the end i gave it a chance and i told myself, ""Hey, let's have some campy fun and not try to think too much."" As soon as the movie starts, and the first line uttered by Gohan, i wanted to leave the cinema hall. In fact after 15 minutes, i wanted the movie to end!!! 90 minutes was just too long.

They changed all the mythology of Dragonball series: 1) the kame-ha-me isn't done like in the series 2) the special effects suck, especially Shenlong 3) to summon Shenlong you must go to a special place, put the dragon balls in some kind of a rock with holes and summon it during the high point of the eclipse (but then Goku summons it after the eclipse!) 4) the sense of time is all wrong: in the beginning we are 2 weeks away from the eclipse but, in the next scene, we're just 4 days away 5) Oozaru appears, not because it's full moon, but because of the eclipse; it is 7 ft tall, it stays with Goku clothes on, and it have no tail!!!

Did anyone in the making of this movie even watch one episode of DB, DBZ, or DBGT? Special places in hell are reserved for asses like this. For one, the whole base of the story is completely off, not that it makes a huge difference because the acting alone is enough to make even the smallest of fans to the Dragonball universe cry and hang their heads in shame. This is nothing but a baseless rip off of one of the most celebrated anime classics and unfortunately more and more movies are heading in this direction. Can we please get a director with a set of balls to direct a movie based on the actual characters and plots of the story they are trying to show?",2009

1,"I was really enjoying the comments and was laughing my heart out at some point in time. I thought of leaving this website fully satisfied. But during the end I saw some comments and they made me to write this. When I first heard about the movie, I decided not to watch it because I thought DB is way beyond any live-action adaptation (all the fans know why). When I saw the trailer I was however surprised by the movie makers' creativity when I saw a Master Roshi with silky hair fit for any convincing shampoo ad. I knew instantly that the movie team is gonna surpass 'Citizen Kane', 'Shawshank Redemption', etc. easily. I knew that the movie would be too intellectual and too realistic for a stupid idiotic DB fan fool like me. Some coveted jury members of Academy Awards even said that they wanted a realistic movie so that they could relate themselves with Goku (just like Batman i guess). I am a hardcore DB fan and I too, like any other DB fan, would like to meet these 'beings' from Planet Vegeta (although I like DB but I am sane enough to accept the fact that Goku is an alien unlike the ones who want to relate themselves with Goku). Apart from these, 'Citizen Kane', hah, way too inferior than this masterpiece of this century. Right now I am waiting for at least 10 sequels so that I can send them to Al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups. They can make millions of copies, give them different names and drop them from air in countries like US and UK. People would watch them without suspicion and would definitely kill each other or commit suicide after watching such noble creations for they would think how worms like them dared to adore modern day ""MONALISA"" called sequels of DRAGONBALL EVOLUTION. Finally, terrorist organizations can enjoy a result far more devastating than 9/11.",2009

When i saw the first trailer and i heard gokus character say ""I don't think i can do this"" I pretty much lost all faith in the movie. It's an insult to toriyama it's an insult to the franchise and it's an insult to the fans of the dragonball series. Goku is a highschool student while in the series he'd never even met a girl before. In the series he didn't even know the meaning of the words ""give up"". Minor adaptations i can handle but this is just plain sad...",2009

7,"Smart and funny, absurd and a bit self-conscious but as soon as I had time to think, I thought. The cast is fun but reeks of pre-sales needs. The names in the cast propels you to expectation that are going to let you down no matter how you put it. George Clooney is great fun but try, just try to imagine a great actor you never heard of in that part. I couldn't separate the character from the actor not for a second. So I saw Clooney being funny and that does something to the film that keeps its real intentions at arms length because the star-actor gets in the way. I have a feeling however that time will be kind to this film. Audiences will be able to see it again in years to come with more objectivity and appreciate it much more.",2018
8,"Even from the title, a person can guess that this movie will be different. Men staring at goats doesn't seem like the most interesting plot line; maybe then does the movie aim to be original rather than just having commercial appeal? The answer is a resounding yes. Men Who Stare at Goats is absurd, odd, hilarious, amusing, definitely original, possibly good and not at all what you would expect.",2010
10,"After reading some of the reviews here, I came to this film expecting to be disappointed. How wrong I was! It turned out to be one of the funniest, most powerful films that I have seen in years. It reminded me of some of the great movies of the sixties and seventies. Times have changed and it seems that people no longer get the kind of satire that grabbed us back then. I was constantly reminded of films like ""Catch 22,"""" M.A.S.H."" ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest,"" and ""Steelyard Blues."" In those days, we got it. Now, people see that ""Hippy Philosophy"" thing as a cliché. They cannot see the relevance to today's world, which is a pity. ""The Men Who Stare At Goats' is a genre film, in the tradition of those great comic satires that challenged the status quo so effectively, 40 years back. I truly believe its reputation will grow, over the years.",2010

The piece gives us suggestions, it gives us alternatives. We now have some idea as to where we are going. Nothing definitive. We are all now remote viewers. One piece leads to another piece, and another set of possibilities. Gradually Bob Wilton finds his purpose.",2011
8,"It's worth mentioning, too, that, like McGregor, another actor has been doing some good, different, and mostly unsung work lately. After voicing Gerty the robot in Moon and making an unexpectedly amusing cameo in the Britflick Telstar, Kevin Spacey is just terrific as Larry Hooper, the cynical Darth Vader to Django's Luke Skywalker. And when Bridges, Clooney and Spacey are all on screen, The Men Who Stare At Goats feels most alive — like a military version of Anchorman, with a more subtle sense of stupidity — while Heslov's bright, heightened colour palette adds the sense of an almost magical, distant summer. Such moments are as close as the film gets to a point — like the custard-pie fight that was cut from Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, this is a black comedy about national security, and the ridiculous demands that paranoia will feed.",2010
8,"The story borrows liberally from the exploits of Joe McMoneagle and Ingo Swann and the cadré of Remote Viewers stationed at Fort Meade, MD, under the operational detachment Project Stargate. Yes, as the film states upfront: ""More of this is true than you would believe"". There are instances in the film that incorporate actual Stargate operations: tracking submarines, finding a kidnapped American General in Italy and the search for Noriega following the US invasion of Panama. The comedy comes from the disconnect that the professional military hierarchy has from the rest of us. The Pentagon has too much money at its disposal and its internal political dynamics encourage a bizarre mixture of risk-averse yet forward-thinking innovators. This was particularly rampant after our loss in Vietnam. Vietnam and the Cold War combined to pull the Pentagon Brass in a thousand different directions and created a schism in the strategic planning sectors that is ripe for comedic exploration. Grant Heslov deftly captured this cultural watershed through his direction of the film. He ably guided the actors in performances that while sometimes brief, captured the totality of the real absurdity that the military can sometimes give us, while keeping the characters real and grounded and not drifting into farce. Heslov has captured an elusive tone, entirely his own, that I've only previously seen in Coen Brother's films. This is a story I've longed to see told on the big screen and it was worth the wait. You could say its a story about the Military-Insanity Complex, but that's too broad a brush for this slice of American military history. Clooney is brilliantly understated as always, he's a master of subtlety and an actor that understands how powerful the camera can be. Kevin Spacey is throughly despicable as the film's only real villain. If the film has any flaws at all its that Spacey is not in it enough. But the most poignant character is beautifully drawn by Jeff Bridges, who in just a few scenes depicts the inevitable trajectory of the innovative free-thinker in a rigid, uncaring system. Bridges shows us the cost of being that individual and Heslov gives the film room to explore this aspect of the story without sacrificing the reason we're all there to watch: and that is to have a laugh at something that maybe should never have happened but did.",2009
10,"I hate to slam anyone who didn't like and enjoy this movie. They chose four of the very best actors who fit together like a glove. I found it to be exceptional acting. Although many of you might only watch a movie once and then give up I don't know how many times I have seen it. Each time I decide to turn it on, as I have it recorded in two rooms, I laugh from beginning to end. And, I wouldn't be surprised if some day we find out that parts of this are very true. I just heard last week that the government is looking into paranormal tactics. What a surprise. Could very well be that it's just another one of our country's secrets. I'm just sorry I didn't know it was being shot in New Mexico as I am not too far from Roswell. I would have loved to have been there. I have searched and searched for the bloopers but cannot find them. There is no way the four head actors could have possibly made this movie without falling apart. Oh well.....those of you who didn't really get into it.....sorry....it is so well done and so very funny!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Sue",2011
10,"I understand that not everyone will get this movie, but for me it was an overwhelming emotional ride because I share the same philosophy as the character Bill Django (Jeff Bridges). I recommend this movie to anyone who likes to ask questions about why things are the way they are in our world and wonders what we can do to change it. It was intelligent and funny, and will probably be appealing to more open-minded viewers. There are too few movies like this and I enjoyed that it made me think. It has that altruistic feel to it that doesn't sit well with everyone based on some other reviews, which perhaps makes it an even more important movie for our times.",2010
6,"Watching Grant Heslov's ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" was tantamount to staring at a stick of dynamite - for 93 minutes - that never exploded. All the critical mass of a quirky, eccentric comedy (i.e., an able cast, a political pseudo-relevance) seemed to be undercut by clunky writing, tacky 'Watch people fall down, get run over, and laugh' stunts, and a painfully disjointed plot which can barely be deemed a plot at all. Rather, the movie featured more of a direction: an ill-defined, ill-conceived mission toward which two characters (Clooney's Lyn Cassady and McGregor's Bob Wilton) floated. The problem with the loose plot development, in this case, is that Clooney's chemistry with McGregor feels forced and their connection in the film equally contrived. The film was peppered with flashback (to which Bridges and Spacey owe the majority of their on-screen time) which jettisoned any chance the viewer had with feeling an investment toward the central story or its characters. In fact, the film stumbles from character to character so often that the viewer is caught juggling them under the central story arc -- and we never really care about most of them in the first place.",2009

9,"It was a terrific movie, but not for everyone. It was thoroughly enjoyable, and completely unexpected. I was anticipating a ""simpler"" comedy from the previews, and although there were some slapstick elements, the movie was significantly more complex. Many of the negative comments are that the movie either jumps around too much, or is not connected well, but if you know the factual parts of the movie, the Men Who Stare at Goats is connected, and it makes perfect sense. I was debating if the next would be considered a ""spoiler"", but it's purely historical information, some of which is in my American History textbook, so I'll list some general historical knowledge that will undoubtedly make the movie more enjoyable. First, Lt. Col. Jim Channon created the First Earth Battalion, where soldiers would carry flowers into battle, and use techniques such as, ""Starry Eyes"". The CIA did give soldiers LSD without their knowledge, and Special Forces were trained to be ""psychic spies"" during the Vietnam and Cold Wars.",2009

It's just an accumulation of absurd dialogues and crazy moments with real good actors that don't consider themselves too good to act silly (not too silly) although they certainly were unchallenged by the script. The shown sense of humour reminded me slightly of the humour in the fashion of the Coen brothers in terms of pace and surreality, however, less sarcastic, less biting and without cynicism. The characters are rather likable, harmless individuals trying to find peace in a violent surrounding. I would classify this film as a satire about everything the army represents in general and once you've realized how stupid the army is you'll find this an amusing 93 minutes of fun.",2012

Honestly, I love you Beth Cooper is not going to be one of those high school movie classics by no mean, but I didn't feel like my time was wasted watching it. As predictable and silly as it was, I still think this was a decent enough movie that got a few good laughs. I mean, who hasn't wanted to go all out on their high school class and just mock them on the last day of school? Not to mention get the hottie of their dreams in the same night that has them just living life to it's fullest. I think that over all the film worked, there were certain things that were flawed in the movie like the script could have used a few touch up's here and there and the cast did seem a little off. Paul Rust, it's kind of disturbing that he not only looks but is 28 years old and then you have Hayden Panettiere who looks 12 years old, it was a little well, you get the idea.

The fact that the story has little character set-up and uses every cliché stolen from numerous comedies before it does not help the ill paced scenes.",2009
7,"Come on, this is a high school comedy the way they used to do them back in the '80s! This is not John Hughes territory, as you might be led to believe upon seeing ""Home Alone"" director Chris Columbus at the helm. No, this is another breed of '80s comedy. This is more ""Three O'Clock High"" than ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off,"" which is not necessarily a bad thing, depending on your taste. The humor here is broad and unsophisticated, for the most part, but fits with the brisk pacing and sunny tone of the film. This movie invites you to have a good time along with the cast. It throws you in the middle of a heightened reality/unlikely scenario (most geeks do not suddenly grow a pair and profess their love for the hottest girl in school during their valedictorian speech) and beckons you to simply enjoy the ride. While the films of John Hughes endeavor to depict a realistic panoramic view into the teenage mind, taking stereotypes and turning them inside out, this film, and its grandaddy ""Three O'Clock High"" do not carry such aspirations. They are fantasy, pure and true, and are all about having a good time. If the characters are two dimensional, so what? If the plot is threadbare, so what? Character development and story arc are not reasons to see a movie like ""I Love You Beth Cooper."" This is just a classic homespun yarn, taking place in Anywhere, USA, about a geek who outsmarts a bully and gets the girl. If you expected more, you're going to be disappointed. This is the kind of movie that could work just as well as a cartoon. It's a zippy, predictable ride from point A to point B, but the journey is not lacking in entertainment value. If you, like me, are a fan of ""Three O'Clock High"" and on many-a-day would watch it over ""Bueller,"" then you're in for a treat because this is practically a remake albeit with the addition of a love interest.",2009

2,"""Recycle"" is generally a good word, one with positive and favorable connotations. But not in the world of movies. I Love You, Beth Cooper is one of those films that horrendously overuses the ideas (and not even the better ones) of previous entries in the teen comedy genre, resulting in an exercise in repetition and failed mimicry. Awkwardly personal advice from a father figure, aggressive small animals, nude scenes without any real nudity, and the all-too-familiar plot line of the bashful introvert chasing after the most popular girl in school are just a few of the rehashed concepts found throughout the picture. There are really only two reasons the film gets a score of two - and both belong to Hayden Panattierre.",2009
7,"Thumb through a video store catalog, and there are a dime a dozen of many teen comedies out there that you'll be hard pressed to find something that either didn't deal with hard partying, road trips, one crazy night of post-graduation party, self-discovery, friendship and the likes. In fact, I Love You, Beth Cooper, has almost all those cliché moments filled with stereotypical characters, but under the direction of Chris Columbus, this story by Larry Doyle actually came across in quite enjoyable terms, thanks to what I thought made the movie – a line that was uttered upon stark realization, and the fear as expressed by the titular character, which made it quite distinct and standing out amongst the competition.",2009
1,"The new comedy, I Love You Beth Cooper stars Paul Rust as Dennis, a nerd, who at graduation simultaneously insults everyone who's harmed him, and tells Beth Cooper (Hayden Pannetiere) that he loves her. This was suggested by his closeted gay friend, Rich (Jack Carpenter). Rich is a character in extremely terrible taste, although he has the only funny part where his character has been training to hurt someone with a wet towel. There is one part in which I had no decision but to automatically hate it right then and there. The part is the fact that Dennis tells a school bully he's so mean because he was probably sexually abused as a kid. Later in the film, he admits he was sexually abused. Director Chris Colombus makes it seem like you're supposed to laugh at this kid when it's actually extremely depressing. I can't believe director Chris Colombus, director of Home Alone 1 & 2, Only The Lonely, and Adventures In Babysitting gave us this turd. I don't even want to talk about this movie anymore.

The director seemed to be working off lots of cringing awkward moments that were not the least bit clever. I had to leave when it was certain that all the characters were going to stay in their very simple formats. The main character is awkward, his friend is badly presented as closeted gay, the main girl is sweet and a little crazy, her friend is a slut, and the other one had not done anything by the time I left. All the gags were obvious well before they were presented so I do not recommend this in a format where you cannot fast forward.",2009

The girls that are Beth's friends- I couldn't figure them out. Nothing there? The boy that is the male lead's friend- why make such a big deal over his sexuality? That gets in the way of the main storyline. Rather than it being an incredibly fun or funny night, it's painful to watch this trainwreck. Normally I like Hayden, but this film is not normal...it's undefinable. I didn't buy him seeing the real girl beneath the Beth Cooper popular girl facade. How can he ""know"" her like that?

Nerdy high school valedictorian Denis (PAUL RUST), urged on by his best friend Rich (JACK CARPENTER), gives a graduation speech in which he makes comments about numerous classmates— calling one stuck-up, one a bully, one gay, & one – Beth Cooper (HAYDEN PANATIERRE) – as being the object of his love. With a hidden agenda (including upsetting her current ROTC boyfriend Kevin – played by SHAWN ROBERTS), Beth & 2 girlfriends (Cammy, played by LAUREN London, & Treece, played by LAUREN STORM) show up at Denis' grad party. As the girls & guys spend time together, there are the ""usual"" high-jinks-- getting drunk, driving badly, fighting, making out, etc. It's not especially clever or funny, it's not very boisterous, but you end up understanding & ""pulling"" for the ""good guys"". The decently-acted film achieves what it sets out to do (namely, make some gentle observations about the difficulties in growing up).",2009

4,"I can usually find -something- to enjoy in nearly every movie in the ""high schooler hijinks"" genre and its ""nerd pursues and gets the popular girl"" sub-genre, but not even a brief flash of almost- nudity on Hayden Panettiere's part made this movie remotely worth the price of admission or the time I spent watching it.",2009
3,"I saw this trainwreck of a film because it aired after a better program was over and I was too lazy to grab the remote and change the channel. Basically this is a ripoff of all of John Hughes' best films from the eighties, from Breakfast Club to Weird Science. As a Hughes fan this hurts. As a Hughes fan who knows that Chris Columbus worked with John Hughes before, this hurts even more. The physical comedy with the Army boyfriend and his buddies and the soul-searching introspective dialogue between Beth and Denis might have worked if this were '85 and Hughes was pinning the script but Larry Doyle is no John Hughes and this certainly isn't 1985. If anything I'm amazed that movies like this are greenlit. If you want teen humor mixed with some surprising character development and intelligent dialogue, just rent or buy Sixteen Candles, Breakfast Club or Weird Science. Heck, you could even go with Dawson's Creek which is more Hughes than this movie could ever be.",2013
2,"I Love You, Beth Cooper (2009): Dir: Chris Columbus / Cast: Hayden Panettiere, Paul Rust, Jack T. Carpenter, Shawn Roberts, Lauren London: Morbid teen comedy about infatuation. A nerdy valedictorian announces his lust for Beth and what follows is an evening of reckless driving and violent encounters with her much bigger ex-boyfriend. Predictable trash as if anyone cares whether these two unite. Why is Chris Columbus directing this? For a guy who brought us the first two Home Alone and Harry Potter films as well as Mrs. Doubtfire and Rent this just seems beneath his talent. The only benefit is the fact that he hasn't directed a film of this nature before but did it have to be a teen flick of this level of dread? He is far too talented for this. Hayden Panettiere plays an irresponsible bimbo who shouldn't be driving. Beth Cooper is basically eye candy with the personality of a can of hair spray. Paul Rust overacts as her suitor in typical pursuit fashion. Jack T. Carpenter plays his gay best friend who denies his sexuality. Shawn Roberts plays the embarrassing ex-boyfriend. Lauren London and Lauren Storm have the misfortune of playing Beth Cooper's airhead friends. None of this is particularly thrilling and seems bent on presenting mindless humour that is more irritating than funny. Bottom line, if you love Beth Cooper, you may be too easy to please. Score: 2 / 10",2015
7,"""I Love You, Beth Cooper"" opened with an extremely awkward scene, Denis (Paul Rust) confessing his love for Beth Cooper (Hayden Panettiere) during his valedictorian speech at his High School graduation. It was so awkward. I was so uncomfortable and embarrassed for him; it made me cringe. I didn't want to look but I just couldn't look away. The awkwardness was lightened with a few very funny remarks made during the speech. Luckily this was the only awkward humor. I don't think I would be able to handle a whole lot of that.",2014
5,"'I Love You Beth Cooper' is a teen comedy that gently pushes a few boundaries but doesn't really do anything new. It is based on the book of the same name by Larry Doyle.

Unfortunately, due to some poor timing many of the jokes fall flat leaving the film to stutter instead of flow.",2009

8,"I Love You Beth Cooper will never be heralded by critics. But as usual that never means that it isn't worth seeing. With a film like this you must look at the key demographic which in this case is the new generation of teenies both male and female who are far more racier than ever before requiring the maturity of shows such as Gossip Girl and films like this as opposed to Princess Diaries or even Mean Girls. Beth Cooper is a fantasy for geeks and teen boys everywhere and for girls its just a fun ride with the cool girls. It doesn't boast intelligence or even a moral really in fact I think ultimately it shows that the object of teen infatuation is often not what you dream her/him to be. There is some honest attempt at making the more vapid characters see the errors of their ways but the characters are already vapid and shallow and that is the only way to portray them so to have them have any sort of epiphany defeats the purpose of the vapid and fantasy driven movie. Does that sound negative? Its not. Most people go to films to escape reality, to have a fantasy away from their own lives and Beth Cooper is the perfect escape for teenies and those of us who miss our teenage years.",2009

I hear my friends talk about Twilight and how wonderful the books and movies are, and I had to check them out. The first film was OK, but not better than it's rated. And then I sat down and saw this one, and..well, I will actually say it's OVERrated. The only good thing about this one is when Taylor Lautner smiles and takes off his shirt. Nothing else, and that is embarrassing. They can't act, especially this..Kirsten. I mean, I had to ask my friend if she was supposed to be so..cold, and without any feelings at all. And yes, she was, because she was so shy and didn't like any attention. But I don't see her acting, really. She shows just as much acting skills and emotions like Tobey Maguire in Spider-Man. She doesn't have any passion, it looks like she's bored. And yes, Robert Pattinson is way better than her, but there's still a long way to Tom Hanks. In my opinion, the acting are one of the reasons this doesn't work out. Even though the chemistry between Robert and Kirsten is impressive.",2010

It also made vampires into a joke, New Moon had potential to give the series some life. Unfortunately, we got trash. Not only vampires are a joke to this story, but these movies are a joke and an embarrassment to cinema. I'm trying to not be cruel, because I honestly feel so sorry for this cast, since they don't have much material to work with. For God's sake they have lines like ""Your breathing is my gift"", ""You don't belong in my world"", and ""I couldn't live in a world without you existing"". How could you work with soap opera lines like that? Not to mention, more than 80% of the film is 5 buff meaty guys in jean shorts, which I'm above those jokes, but I was expecting as they walked on screen ""Gonna Make You Sweat"" was going to play in the background. It seems like this was teenage porn for a while because every girl in the theater kept going crazy with Jacob's 6, no, 12 pack abs exposed. It seems like every chance the director got, he had to make the little girls happy by exploiting these young actors.",2009

She is the core of the story, with Edward absent for a significant portion of the film. Without a good core, the cheesy dialogue and long sorrowful glances are just that, cheesy and long, it's impossible to see past them. It takes FOREVER for anything to happen. Happy or sad, suicidal or in a bad mood, it really is impossible to tell. Kirsten's broody look never changes. Scenes which should have some poignancy are simply flat and dull. I know that the character is somewhat thinly written, but really, come on. And then Robert Pattinson comes back in, and he also delivers his lines as though he's reading from a telephone directory. Very disappointing.",2012

3,"Kristen Stewart once called herself as a ""professional liar"" when referring to her performances in movies, like Twilight. The problem with ""New Moon"" is that the performances of Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattison, Taylor Lautner, Anna Kendrick and others are so obviously a lie that it is nearly impossible to believe in any of them. In this respect, New Moon is a very inferior film to the first Twilight which, for all its flaws, at least had believable characters and a believable love story. The main reason for this major flaw in New Moon is that the script lacks compelling dialogue. Most of the dialogue, especially in the beginning, is absurd; and the actors know that their dialogue is absurd because they give the consistent impression that they do not believe in what they are saying. So the result is a superficial vampire movie. ",2010
6,"For the past two years, I've avoided the Twilight saga like the plague because it just looked so melodramatic and ruined the image of scary vampires like Dracula. Instead, we get a Glampire, buff Werewolves, and a whiny teen named Bella who is suicidal over them. There was a double feature at my theater tonight, so I finally decided to cave in and watch. Bella is just ridiculous. After she gets a paper cut at her birthday party, Jasper Cullen tries to attack her. The Cullens soon decide to leave Forks, and Bella goes into a deep depression. Whenever she gets an adrenaline fix, she can see glimpses of Edward. If you love glampires and melodramatic love stories, I'm sure you'll love NEW MOON!!!",2010

Is it really so interesting seeing something like that. And then the wolves. Hah, to me they're just over grown,and over animated, huskies, you know polar dogs. Then over to the acting, could it be worst, I mean Jacob Black is one of the least interesting characters in a movie, or book for that matter. Yeah , I know it's because he's changing he becomes an asshole, but could it be executed a little better. Like, here it go's, so he like just starts getting sick and so on but not start yelling at everyone. Oh, here's the best part. So Jacob and Edward both want Bella (don't get me started on her) but still they're both saying i'm dangerous you shouldn't come near me, but still they are willing to fight a death match over her. Jezus... end now to the ending, 'Bella will you marry me?'. So this it what she should say: 'Yes Edward (blablabla)', but this is what she will say (and haven't read the book) 'i don't know Edward', or 'Oh my God' or 'I don't know how to answer to this...'.

Taylor was pretty good for the most part. he over acted at times and it came off as fake to me. like something you would see in a soap opera. but the rest of the Cullen clan,the wolf pack,and her school mates were excellent. the cgi was good,had really good stunt work. some lines seemed out of place to me. the leading roles need to FEEL the words and not just say them nonchalantly. the ending was bad to. they cut too many scenes from the book that would make a big difference to. so overall I'm disappointed. why this is such a big franchise i have no idea. fans are too obsessed, boggles my mind.i was left dissatisfied, but of course the rabid fan base will approve.",2009

And Ashley (Alice) - she was terrible. She was so much better in Twilight - at least she showed some character, but here it was like watching paint dry when she spoke.

From the opening scene, I wanted - expected something to grab me - be it the scene or the soundtrack.. but it fell flat. The film's director or maybe screenwriter tried to reproduce the book faithfully, yes it's closer to the book, but in doing so, the first half just dragged on, and the music score did not help.The pace was so slow, the dialogue just fell flat, Edward's eyebrows were too bushy (they were plucked/trimmed in the 1st movie), the Cullen's contacts looked nothing like the 1st movie. Alexandre Desplat is a great music scorer- but his style does not suit this movie..there were scenes that required music, but there was none.

Ledger's performance is good, as one would expect, but he has done better and more iconic roles. The problem faced by his death occurring before filming completed is overcome easily and one would not necessarily know that Ledger had died just from the evidence of the film. There is a fitting tribute to him in the film, as Johnny Depp's version of Heath Ledger's character comments on how celebrities who died young will live on forever.",2009

It's in the vein of the great European surrealistic movies like Fellini's ""8 1/2"" or ""Satyricon"". But--if you're not open to a mind bending, almost psychedelic fantasy and a plot with strange twists and turns that can be challenging to follow, this won't be for you. The cast is terrific--I mean, Tom Waits plays ""Old Scratch""--how can you lose? Christopher Plummer is excellent in the title role; Heath Ledger's last performance is stellar. Lily Cole, Johnny Depp, Andrew Garfield, Jude Law, Verne Troyer, and Colin Farrell are also very good. The costumes and sets are gorgeous, though often in a dark and grungy way. By the way--it also ends up being a story about ethical choices in life and how some people are very misleading.

I had little trouble not only following this film, but following the changes of characters caused by Heath Ledger's death. Actually, the best of the characters was Johnny Depp, as usual. Everyone else who played the part, including Ledger, seemed to be walking through the lines. Overall, I loved the film. It definitely should have won best set decoration, and Christopher Plummer should have been a candidate for best actor.

I cannot think of any other film that is as multi-layered in this regard. It appears the state of mind / soul of the viewer determines the viewing experience.

7,"""Don't worry if you don't understand it all at first"" The quote from the opening of The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus just about sums up the entire film, and perhaps the works of its director as a whole. The films of Terry Gilliam defy explanation or description; he approaches each film with his untouched creative vision and inventiveness. Every world he creates is wholly unique; he is the master of the original, and the fantasy. The great Dr. Parnassus made a wager, a bet with the devil himself, and he won. Granted immortality, but at a great cost, the life of his first born, his daughter on turning age 16 is forfeit to the fiend. Living on the street as a traveling stage show; Parnassus grants onlookers a chance to enter into his Imaginarium, a world of their own mind. The doctor is cursed, cursed to live forever, to watch and wait for the day of his daughters 16th birthday, a day that is looming. The devil loves a game, and makes another gamble with the Doctor: Lead 5 souls into the Imaginarium, grant them the choice between the sides of darkness and enlightenment. Win 5 souls before the day of his daughter's birth and win her freedom. The match is set, but the devil does not play fair, he loves the game above all else. There is an interesting conflict between Dr. Parnassus's two worlds, the grim dank reality of his life as a meek street performer, and the whimsical animated realm of his Imaginarium. Containing some of the most grounded characters of a Gilliam film, and yet some of the most fantastic dreamscapes. The traveling stage troop rescues a hanged man, a young man left for dead, fortune places him in there company, an amnesiac played by the late Heath Ledger in his last performance, one that he was unable to complete, Ledger proves once again the great talent that was lost. He is expressive, shrewd, and a joy to watch. It is an unavoidable distraction to think of the man behind the character, to see the great talent just beginning to come to light, we lost an actor of immense talent and charisma. Terry Gilliam for all his creativity and skill may be cursed. His filmography is fraught with difficulty and even disaster. He fought tooth and nail over his edit of Brazil, his lead actor in Don Quixote had a herniated disc and a flash flood destroyed a set, nearly every one of his films has struggled for financing and his creative control. And now the young burgeoning talent he cast in his latest dies during film-making, the man is truly cursed. The solution to the passing of his actor and friend was quite ingenious. As Ledgers character enters the Imaginarium, his appearance is changed, altered to reflect the imagination of the current participant in the realm. Jonny Deep, Jude Law, and Collin Farrell each admirably take there turns as incarnations of Ledger's character. It works surprisingly well, as they all bring a slightly different persona to the character as he is transformed by imagination. Farrell is able to capture the essence of Ledgers performance with the greatest quality, but all three are to be commended for finishing the last work of a great man. The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus is a wild film, the animated formless, ever changing realm of imagination is vivid and very enjoyable to observe. It is a very interesting fantasy, and Terry Gilliam's insane touch is present thought out. It does not reach the level of Gilliam's greatest works, it lags a bit struggling to truly catch my attention, but I enjoyed the movie, it was a fun if confusing ride, I can't say I understood it all, but I think that maybe the point. It is a journey of wild creativity, and unmistakable original. A very entertaining abstract vision, with a surprisingly likable ending, it's a fun diversion from reality, a glimpse into the mad mind of Terry Gilliam.",2010
2,"This movie is SO busy and chaotic that it turns into a bore to follow. Trying to chase down the non-sequitor story lines becomes a absolutely labor intensive. I was psyched to see it as it is an exceptional cast and if there is any saving grace, that would be it. The trouble is that there are too many story lines thrown at you before you can get to the crux of the deal; None of the arcs are all that engaging or captivating; they just keep popping up out of nowhere and end up nowhere. The heart of the story is Parnassus's deal with Nick and what he ultimately has to give up when time comes to settle up; but frankly Terry Gilliam puts you through the ringer to get you there. Terry Gilliam's films seem to get more and more cluttered which is a pity being that the best work he did was with Monty Python as a visual artist and possibly satirist and though Brazil and The Fisher King were fun and engaging, the rest of his films become like a forest of fun house mirrors. I got a headache watching this film. Sorry Terry.",2010
1,"Doctor Parnassus runs a show of some sorts traveling in an ancient stage coach pulled by horses. He has lost a bet to the devil which obligates him to give away his daughter when she turns 16. The movie starts out quite impressively and witty, but quickly morphs into an excruciating mess of harrowing scenes and maniacal acting. If there was a plot to speak of at the beginning, don't bother looking for it after the 30 minute mark. Who was it that said that movies need some type of outline, some coherent narrative structure or something to keep all the separate parts together? Why bother with that when you've got all this entropy to explore! Another self indulgent atrocity from Mr. Gilliam who seems determined on making absolutely sure that no one in their right minds will ever provide him with funding again.",2011
7,"Terry Gilliam films are never known for telling a straight story and his productions are no different. Often both are fraught with setbacks, doomed failure and last minute redemption. His 1999 production of The Man Who Killed Don Quixote was a spectacular disaster. On the second day of shooting, a flood ravaged the set causing $15 million in damages and was compounded days later when his lead actor, Jean Rochefort, sustained a slipped disc which forced the film to shut down. However, a second film crew was documenting the entire proceedings and produced the rather interesting documentary Lost In La Mancha.",2009
5,"Gilliam's strength, as always, is in having the ability to project the craziest depths of his imagination on to the big screen and this film provides the ideal platform for him to showcase his stunning visual conceptions.

6,"I'll spare you any suspense, here. Simply put, Public Enemies is a major disappointment. There is one aspect that the film has going for it, though, and that is the performances. Johnny Depp is great but, as I've read in other reviews, not exactly irreplaceable. Marion Cotillard is fantastic, but underused. Christian Bale is solid, but pretty forgettable. Unfortunately, everything else about the film proved disappointing.",2009
7,"Public Enemies is an alright docu-crime-thriller that, thought well-made, ends up coming out dry. Many of the scenes are well paced, but in its running time the film feels like a very rushed overview of the final years of John Dillinger. What I mean to say is that this is a good movie, but you probably won't leave the theater feeling like you've learned anything about John Dillinger, other than trivial facts. The movie never really gives Johnny Depp a chance to shape the character into a believable icon because as I previously stated this film feels more like a dramatized overview of Dillinger's career instead of focusing on the man himself.",2009
5,"Very disappointing retelling of the 13-month John Dillinger crime spree across the Midwest in 1933-34. Here's why without any BS: 1.) No personality. Gang members remain ciphers throughout. (When Red Hamilton (Jason Clark) dies after being in EVERY OTHER SCENE you think: Who the hell is he. None of the subsidiary people pop, unlike the vast number of vivid unique individuals in HEAT. 2.) Depp miscast badly. Read about Dillinger: he was ebullient, charming, commanding. With NO experience he commandeered the best pro bank robbers in the Midwest to follow his lead and led them on a 13-month blaze of glory and infamy. Depp instead is pensive, moody, brooding, internalized: he never displays the charisma and guile that the historic Dillinger did. He was chosen for his romantic chops, not his gangster chops, because of . . . 3.) Misemphasis on romantic. Mann pays too much attention to Dillinger's least interesting thing, that is, his affair with Billy Freschette. This was clearly NOT a love-unto-death deal like Bonnie and Clyde. Before Billy, Dillinger had girlfriends, after Billy Dillinger had girlfriends and during Billy, Dillinger had girlfriends. The guy had been in stir 9 years; he had a lot of catching up to do. Mann emphasizes this affair, ignores Dillinger's unique connection to his family in Indiana (very interesting), his leadership skills, his courage. Very odd and unfortunate (and disappointing) choice. 4.) Accuracy, as in, lack thereof. Mann really doesn't progress beyond Milius's 1973 truncated take; he starts out with lies (Dillinger at escape from state pen by his cohorts, Purvis singlehandedly bringing down Pretty Boy Floyd) in the first two scenes and it never gets better. In fact most of the men we watch die in the film died AFTER, not before, Dillinger, including Floyd and Babyface Nelson and Homer Van Meter and Harry Pierpont. Why did Mann buy rights to Burroughs' ""Public Enemies"" if he was going to make stuff up? Also (SPOILER): a major meme in the film is that the syndicate, under Frank Nitti, ""got"" Dillinger because his kind of spectacular showboat caper was screwing things up for the big money boys; in the literature, I can find NO evidence of this being the case. 5.) Introduced, then abandoned, themes: Mann intros at least four major ideas about Dillinger and his fate which could serve as a kind of structure for the movie; then he abandons all of them, leaving them as pointless curiosities. The first I've mentioned: that the mob got Dillinger. No. 2 (from Burroughs): Hoover used the Road Warrior bandits crime spree as a methodology to grow his Bureau and cement his own control of it and his place in popular culture. No. 3: the coming of western gunman. Indeed, at a certain point, the Bureau did bring in experienced gunfighters as Mann shows, but he never really dramatizes or builds on their contribution to the take-down of the bad guys. He seems to set up, then walk away from the idea of cowboys vs. bank robbers. Very disappointing. 4. The inexperience of Hoover. He includes a scene (it actually took place in 1936, not '33) where a Senator derides Hoover and makes a big deal over the fact that Hoover's never made an arrest. Then of course Mann doesn't bring that issue to conclusion, showing Hoover arresting Alvin Karpis, who is a kind of mystery guest (he's played by Giovonni Ribisi) who appears and disappears from the film without explanation. Which leads to: 6.) Editing woes. Ribisi is just one such mystery guest; other big name, well-known people appear in meaningless, undeveloped characters, suggesting that whole subplots of the film were left out and what we're seeing in a hasty, shortened edit (like the version of ""Once Upon a Time in America"" that was initially released). You can fairly ask: what the hell are Ribisi, Leelee Sobieski, Matt Craven and Steven Lang even doing here when they have so little to do; Craven doesn't even have any lines! I am looking forward to a director's cut sometime in the future. On the plus side, yes: great clothes, great cars, great location shots, superb editing and beast of all great gunfights. But the guns demonstrate some astonishing marginal attention to detail while much large issues of history are deliberately misstated. Why does Mann get the fact the Babyface had a Colt .38 Super converted to a machine pistol with a Thompson vertical fore-grip mounted on the dustcover (look fast or you'll miss it) at the Little Bohemia shootout but insist, after John Milius, (SPOILER) that the Babyface was slain there. Nelson didn't die until October and he went down hard, taking two FBIers with him. Ultimate judgment: such a squandered opportunity! There's probably never going to be another big Dillinger movie and it sickens me that Mann willfully made so many dubious decisions. These people lived and died and fought and bled for and against us, gave us their lives; they deserved SO MUCH BETTER.",2009
7,"Public Enemies, this film has been built up for quite a while, why not? It stars Johnny Depp as one of history's most famous bank robbers. Also the city of Chicago has been excited to see this, in some strange way we considered Dillinger to be a Robin Hood as he never took money from the common man, just from the banks. He also was clever enough to escape jail by making a fake gun out of a soap bar, I lived in Indiana for a year and people are incredibly proud that Crown Point was where Dillinger had fooled everyone, lol. So naturally I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, especially with Johnny Depp as John Dillinger, it's a can't miss. Unfortunately for me, the film fell short of our expectations as the way it was made and how there is lack of material for Depp and Bale to work with to give these characters any depth. Mann makes a film that is using a digital camera for a film set in the 1930's and doesn't really bring his A game to the film as it's more like ""Here's Dillinger's story enjoy"".",2009
8,"It's as hard to get a grip on Mann's impressive but vaguely off-putting new movie about John Dillinger's last thirteen months as it is to project yourself into the coldly beautiful digital images. The title itself provides a clue to the problem: it doesn't focus on the star criminal embodied by the charismatic and -- here -- coolly dashing Johnny Depp, whose quips and provocations in the trailer draw us into the theater to see him, only him, and his bold exploits. It points instead to the wider focus of Mann's book source -- 'Vanity Fair' writer Bryan Burroughs' 600 pages of meticulous research, 'Public Enemies: America's Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI, 1933-34.' Relentless G-man Purvis (a convincing but bloodless Christian Bale) and his rising boss FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover (Billy Crudup, both droll and period) are part of another story as important as the bank robber's final wide ride, the story of the growing cruelty and relentlessness of the forces of American law.",2009
8,"My grandpa's first reaction when he heard this movie was being released was -why? Why yet another movie about Dillinger? What can it add? My grandpa's question triggered my thinking. Movies and Hollywood filmmakers don't seem to care anymore about adding something to history or the medium. They just seem to compulsively adapt other movies, toy lines or videogames into modern reworkings. It's a culture of thoughtless recycling. Fortunately, and although I haven't seen the '30s or '70s biopics, Michael Mann does have something to show.",2009
7,"This is the most known and modern version based on the real life of notorious gangster of the 30s and follows Dillinger's midway through the criminal activities until his death outside Biograph Theatre . Based on the violent career of John Dillinger and his gang , this is a Dillinger biography who roamed US , terrifying the Midwest, robbing banks and killing . It is brought to life in this heavily romanticized story about the most colorful period of criminality in America . It's set during Depression era , when any job , even illegal one , was cherished and greed , money and power originated an interminable cycle of fury and violence . John Dillinger is magnetically played by Johnny Depp , he became number one public enemy and Melvin Purvis (Christian Slater), as a tough G-Man under direct orders of Edward Hoover (Billy Cudrup). Depp and the support cast (as Stephen Lang , Rory Cochrane, John Ortiz , among others) turn fine performances in this enjoyable account of the criminal life . It receives an extremely strong and thrilling fast-paced treatment , almost too violent ; gripping and intense at the time , but remains impressive and brilliant and not easily forgotten and never lets up .",2010
1,"I remember how I felt when I finally realized that Santa Claus did not exist, and I had that same feeling after viewing ""Public Enemies"" with Johnny Depp and Christian Bale. I never thought I'd see a day when these two fine actors would star in such a dull and uninteresting movie.",2009
1,"""Public Enemies"" explores the antics of the 1930's bank robber John Dillinger. Although set during the 1930's Mann chooses to shoot the film in primarily HD and with what appears to be mostly zoom lenses. The fishbowl like hyper-clean HD look and video like color timing of the film is inappropriate and off-putting. Furthermore the choice of the Wide-Angled Zoom lens (used mostly in documentaries) distorts the picture (look for ugly distorted hands in the foreground of the frame when Dillinger dances with his ""girl"" in the first act of the film) and seems student film like. The picture edit lacks a consistent timing and appears rushed and the sound editorial is full of silent holes for no main stream or art house reason that I can think of. It appears that HD, or the way Mann uses and color times HD in this particular film, was not the way to go for a 1930's gangster film. 35mm or perhaps even Super 16mm with some prime lenses may have worked out better for Mann's ""Public Enemies"". Fincher's DP in ""Benjamin Button"" was able to appropriately capture beautiful HD images for him but Mann's camera department seems, quite simply, ""off"", in this film. Why some critics call ""Public Enemies"" a work of art is befuddling to me. The direction of the film is poor as well and lacks a consistent style and a poor revelation of information. Mann's ""Heat"", ""Insider"" and ""Ali"" all were more beautifully shot, edited, and directed than ""Public Enemies"". Even the usually handsome Depp looks old and tired because of the nature of the optics and HD acquisition. Sitting in the theater I saw at least 10 people walk out after about 45 min. into the film and the rest appeared bored and confused. Too bad, I was looking forward to a good gangster movie.",2009
7,"Whenever a Michael Mann movie comes out, I am besieged by expectations. This is one director whose style I seem to consistently like. The Insider, Heat, Collateral, The Last of the Mohicans, and yes.. I LOVED Miami Vice the movie (despite the many negative reviews it seemed to have got). So, when Public Enemies came out, and seeing Mann team up with Johnny Depp and Christian Bale, I knew I could not miss this. However, probably because of the high standards he has set for himself, I was a little disappointed with this. ",2009
7,"Digital is the world of Michael Man with all its drawbacks. It works up to a point, if you don't mind being distracted by the make up on the actors faces, pimples and blemishes. The final adventures on John Dillinger's life look and feel like a work of fiction and I suspect that in ""Public Enemies"" they are, 50/50, fact and fiction. Johnny Depp is marvelous no matter what and his is a star performance. There is only a vague approach to a real characterization, but I didn't care because I go wherever Johnny Depp wants to take me. It was like that with Gary Cooper too, wasn't it? Part of the sneaky narrative is to have Dillinger the criminal played by the angelic Depp and Purvis the noble FBI guy played by Christian Bale that emanates evil without even trying. If you're interested in performances, like I am, Billy Crudup is the thing in a sensational turn as J Edgar Hoover in spite of the digital thing, that makes him look as if Hoover suffered from some rare skin condition, damn shame if you ask me. Marion Cottillard is absolutely lovely but we knew that already and the rest of the characters remain an enigma, they enter and leave the scene without us ever having a clue who they are. Giovanni Ribisi, Stephen Dorff, Jason Clark, who were they and Lelee Sobieski? It was startling to see her appear on the third act. Who was she suppose to be? In any case, the film has a Michael Mann feel and it's technically great. The shootings are extraordinary and Johnny Depp totally beautiful. I suppose that should be enough to applaud and recommend ""Public Enemies"". I did and I will even if, I must confess, I expected more or maybe less.",2009

Dillinger is killed at the end so it's not even how the underdog bad guy (who is really a good guy) gets away. At best this is a reenactment. Too many characters are introduced with no character development and they are all dressed the same making it impossible to keep track of who's who and who the good guys are .vs the bad. There isn't even any subplots to hold your interest. All I can figure is this wasn't good enough to be released around awards time, but the studio still needed to recoup so they sold it as an action shoot 'em up and went after the Independence popcorn crowd. However this movie won't have legs as an action flick, it'll have a 50% drop off in week two and probably disappear from the top 10 by week 3. Not even worth your time on video unless you are writing an essay on Dillenger or are a fan of confusing shaky unmotivated camera work.",2009

I didn't know however, that Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, the writer/director duo that brought us Crank and Crank: High Voltage, were at the helm of Gamer.

6,"I am conflicted about ""It's Complicated."" As you would expect, the acting is impeccable. Three exceptional actors (Queen Meryl, 30 Rock's Emmy winner Alec Baldwin, and Steve Martin) ply their craft perfectly. She is Jane, a late-50s divorcée, luxury bakery owner, and mother of three grown kids. Jake (Baldwin) is the cad of an ex-husband who remarried a much younger woman, Agness (played by Lake Bell) but who remains close to the kids and even to Jane. Martin plays Adam, the architect who has designed Jane's dream home addition, which includes the kitchen she always wanted (a nod to her turn as Julia Child in Julie & Julia). When the whole family goes to New York for the youngest child's graduation, the chick flick begins. The kids go off to a party, leaving Jane to dine by herself in the hotel restaurant/bar. Jake is there alone, too, since his wife and her precocious son conveniently stayed home when the kid got sick. Surprise! Jane and Jake end up drinking and eating at the bar, having a good old time and landing in the sack. The PG bedroom scenes are the best in the movie.",2009

10,"I would give It's Complicated an 11 if it were possible! There isn't anything I would change about this movie. Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin have a chemistry that I'm willing to beg and plead will go on. I want to see more of this duo. My direct request to Nancy Meyers is ""keep these intelligent scripts coming."" This story is an antidote to all the stupid stuff that's being shoveled out of Hollywood. Give us more of this! It's Complicated has both humor and pathos. Steve Martin plays a great foil to Baldwin's character. He's attractive and vulnerable. Streep has a genuine dilemma of riches with these two. If she would have to choose, how could she? In different ways, equally appealing, these guys wear their hearts on their sleeves. And before all the male moviegoers say, ""ugh"" and cross it off as a ""chick flick,"" note that men in the audience laughed as hard and loud as women. ""Hilarious"" honestly applies to this film. The script is tight. The supporting cast is very natural. Jim Krasinski, is especially good in his role as son-in-law. An important note, it's rated R, so leave the kids with a sitter. Treat yourself to a movie that won't bring you down nor insult your intelligence. You'll delight in what fine actors can do when all the ingredients are there.",2009
4,"The set-up for ""It's Complicated"" seemed promising - middle aged woman (Meryl Streep) who thinks she has her post divorce life figured out finds herself ""the other woman"" when she starts an affair with her ex husband (Alec Baldwin). Meryl Streep does all things well including comedy and Alec Baldwin is the perfect fit for a character who is full of himself and conveniently self delusional. Throw in Steve Martin and John Krasinksi (who mines comic gold each week on ""The Office"") and I was expecting a diverting 120 minutes. Instead this movie irritated me continuously for 2 hours. What went wrong? I am going to cut the actors some slack and lay the blame at the feet of director and writer Nancy Meyers. She tends to write movies that have a thin veneer of neurotic self-entitlement. Sometimes it works or is at least tolerable as in ""The Holiday"" but here she lays it on a bit thick. Streep's Jane is the type of woman who has feng shui'd her life into submission, watches ""The Hills"" with her daughter, and makes ice cream when she can't sleep ( funny, all I get are bags under my eyes). Her romantic dilemma is a choice between two men - an architect who lost his wife to another man on a couples bike tour of Italy and the ex who lives under the twin threat of his younger wife's fascist ovulation schedule and a demon step-child. Cliché on top of cliché that eventually eclipses the acting.",2010
1,"Saturday night... movie night with the girlfriend. She wants to get a film I've never really heard of called It's Complicated, from the description all I see is that it's a romcom. I suggest some other films saying that I'm not really in the mood for another romcom, as there seems to be one released every week lately, they're all so formulaic and we seem to see them all.",2010
6,"Nancy Meyers is famous for tapping into a largely ignored market: middle-aged women. She acknowledges that women don't cease to exist after they grow older than Jessica Alba (anyone older than that loses their sex appeal in the eyes of movie studios, and that's the only thing that keeps audiences interested in these sorts of movies).",2010
9,"It's Complicated is simply enjoyable. A good romantic comedy is a rarity, so who better than rom-com specialist Nancy Meyers (The Holiday, Something's Gotta Give, What Women Want) to write and direct yet another? Jane (Meryl Streep) and Jake (Alec Baldwin) have been married for ten years and divorced for fifteen, but while attending their son's college graduation sparks fly between the old flames. But Jake's still married to the much younger Agness (Lake Bell), and Jane's architect and fellow divorceé Adam (Steve Martin) remains an interesting and sensible possibility. This puts everyone on a roller-coaster ride of what-ifs, which includes Jane and Jake's three grown kids.",2010
1,"Why was the crap even produced? Why would Meryl Streep even lower herself and do this? Did she need money? Not even bad TV is as bad as this movie, where the storyline is basically sex. I have to add ten lines to have my review accepted, so here it is: it's stupid, it's pointless, it's dumb, it came out of Pottery Barn and Crate and Barrel, it's talky, it has no value, no meaning, dreadful writing, cliché, worthless, silly, cutesy, blah, blah, blah. Since the movie will be quickly forgotten, with good reason, I don't even have 10 lines to write about it, because it's not even worth 10 lines. Blah, Blah, Blah, which is basically the dialogue of this movie. Am I at 10 lines yet? Yuck. Dreadful movie, despite the ""stars.""",2010
8,"From time to time Hollywood comes up with a surprise product and this movie is one of those surprises. This movie was actually good. It had an actual STORY. The movie is a comedy but has its serious moments too. Meryl Streep was great, Steve Martin was toned down in a support role, but the real star is Alex Baldwin whose presence props up this movie and transforms it into a good if not great cinematic work. As much as the director tries to make this movie a Meryl Streep vehicle, Mr. Baldwin steals the show. This has to be his best movie in years, maybe in his entire career. He is a combination of amusing, charming, and serious and whenever the movie starts dragging a ""dose"" of Mr. Baldwin is enough to get it back on track. What a wonderful performance by an excellent actor. Parts of the movie are hilarious, such as the bedroom scene with Ms. Streep, Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Martin (it's not what you think it is) but generally the humor tends to be at the level of chuckles instead of guffaws. Good movie, worth watching.",2010
9,"Almost a ten for me. 53 year old male who prefers romantic comedy to action-adventure. This film had a wit and a appreciate of today's woman that made the film very slice of life for me. Beautiful scenes, hilarious wit and almost slapstick. This film is not for the prudish but is by no means obscene. Just great adult fare and Meryl Streep can now do anything. This year she has been Julia Child, Mamma Mia and now the Other Woman. I'd want her back too. Bravo, Nancy, Bravo.",2010
7,"Well for a start this a familiar story to most movie lovers I guess. Divorced couple going through hard times in their new lives, coming together because of some family get together, refreshing their relationship and so on.. But should say its not anything boring, it has some real moments and good laughs.",2010
4,"What a stinker of a film! As lazy, sentimental and self-indulgent as its vacuous central characters, it centres on a divorcée played by Streep, tempted to hook up again with her (now remarried) ex played by Alec Baldwin. Good performances by Streep and Steve Martin as the other man in her life are still not sufficient to generate any really sympathy for these over-privileged and self-absorbed individuals. Had they done so then a conclusion that leaves their relationships unresolved would have been a frustrating cop out - as it is one is just glad to escape their company.",2010
1,"The scene where Jane (Streep) confesses all to her adult children who are all tucked under a bed sheet, beside each other, wide eyed, and shocked, summarizes everything that is awful with this movie. It is both immature and weird. Adults behaving like children - or adolescents - is what happens throughout this predictable and mind numbing experience, and is why it is so banal.",2010

They end up in bed together in NYC, then they continue their affair back home. In the meantime, Jane is being pursued by a nerdy architect, played by the unfailingly white-haired Steve Martin, while Jake has to put up with his wife efforts to have another baby. Everybody is white, successful, wealthy and well-mannered even in extreme circumstances. Jane owns a thriving bakery and even her employees are all white, no trace of god-forbid Hispanics, so common in California. Jane and Jake have a young son and two whiny daughters, who seem to have an idyllic relationship with their parents, no matter what. The setting is glossy, the cast amazing, the dialogue atrocious and the pace slow. Everything is so dipped in syrup it's disgusting. Nancy Meyer never again.",2009

3,"If you've seen one Nancy Meyer comedy, you've basically seen everything she has to give -- posh interiors, a sympathetic 50ish actress, older women having hot love affairs, posh interiors, menopause jokes and did I say posh interiors? There IS one reason to see ""It's Complicated"" rather than the others, and that's Alec Baldwin; once a bland pretty boy, he has matured into a sharply funny leading man. Most of us know his work from ""30 Rock"". He's downright hilarious here, bravely baring a pudgy body and letting it all hang out. Many of his scenes are laugh out loud hilarious.",2010

1,Something's Gotta Give is a classic. It's Complicated is the exact opposite.,2010
2,"One aspect of this movie has been widely ignored here: the significance of this movie as a reflection of our culture's moral decline. Here we have a man who has abandoned his wife and kids for the standard mid-life-crisis trophy wife having the gall to initiate an affair with his ex. Here we have a woman so daffy as to accept the idea. The man is undergoing fertility treatments so he can father a child at the age of 59. The children joke about not being damaged even though the emotional harm to children of divorced couples has been widely documented. The psychiatrist shrugs his shoulders and gives his approval to the wife to pursue the affair. And as far as materialism, both my wife and I were astonished that a single woman whose children are moving out is actually putting an ADDITION on her already expansive home. All of this is a pretty sad commentary on the jaded and amoral society we seem to have become.",2012

1,"Jersey Shore....oh where to begin. I'll sum up the show from a first person perspective. I live a good 50 - 75 feet from the Jersey shore, and every summer we're treated to some vacationers from Pennsylvania, north Jersey, and New York. Our benefactors, if you will. For the most part, these people are considerably normal and don't cause any disruption or annoyance, but there are some people, mainly from the cities (or burros) of Staten Island, Brooklyn, and Newark, who are worse than the common fraternity brother, or fratboy, or, as for the females, worse than your typical jezebel, or slut. These people are usually in their early to mid 20's, their bodies covered in tattoos, skin spray tanned orange, men have nasty spiking hairs and steroid induced muscles, women are wearing very revealing clothing and they all act like meatheaded morons who only know beer, drugs, sex, and violence. Guidos, if you will. I often deal with these people up front, as I watch them destroy my town with their antics. A fair amount of the trash talking, and joking about what a ""f**ked up"" place it is comes from these people. So let me give you a short bio of the show, guidos come to New Jersey, trash the place, then get their own TV show, and then New Jersey gets joked about because of it, only because people don't bother to do the research to know that most of the cast isn't even from New Jersey! Does that sound fair? NO! I won't stand for this, the people who ruin my home town, and those surrounding, who pass out drunk in the streets, urinate in public, start fights, break stuff, They get their own show, on a famous network live MTV, and kids will watch this and think ""hey that looks like fun, i should go to the jersey shore and do that!"" In the end, the show is nothing more than a glorified documentary about the guidos who destroy my home state, who i have to deal with first hand. And it's been called ""awesome""....It makes me sick to my stomach. It'll pass, but, no matter what, it will always be New Jersey that's the joke, the victim of the situation, and not the cause. Politicians from New Jersey forever damned to not be taken seriously by any others. And nonstop jokes about New Jersey from people who probably haven't even ever been to the state. Kids will look up to these people and think they're cool. Adults will find it entertaining and laugh at it when it's really quite sad, and to us, the citizens of New Jersey, the people who actually live there, will be forever enraging. And when people say they love the show, in the words of James Rolfe, ""That brings my p!ss to a boil""...I hope you guidos are proud of yourselves.",2010

SHAMEFUL! How do they sleep at night? I bet they don't let their grandchildren watch this. And, the cast looks like they photo-shopped fifty year old faces on thirty-five year old bodies.

2,"... Another bad reality show. Stereotypes of Italians or not, this was awful. First off, It reminded me of one of those Animal Planet Shows where they take animals and put them in special environment, to strive in awesome conditions for the particular species of animal. Also, It reminded me of some of those Twilight Zone Eps where humans are lured to certain situations supposedly conducive to human behaviour and than like that .. end of the world type scenario. In other words, This show was degrading. The whole guido and guidette theme was ridiculous. NJ is just like any other state with a multitude of different ethnicities , religions and races. These early 20 something folks had to be the dumbest of the dumb to not realize how they were being used. Paycheck or not, dignity is most important. At least in my opinion. I must be honest , I watched just the first half of the first episode. I got bored quickly. It was basically one f bomb after another...bleeped out of course. I am far from a prude. I just felt the language got old quickly. I truly felt I was watching 'Animal Planet' with animals being substituted by people.The kicker is , the animals are smarter than this gang of assorted nuts. None of these people were even likable. I wonder if these folks realize that most viewers are laughing AT them.They were a caricature and a bad one at that. Very depressing. This was just a bad show , with lousy stereotypes and skimpy clothing.Contrived or not they did offer ,somewhat of a plot. I wont give away here.

They search for meaning in their tristate-confined lives using alcohol, herpes-infested hot tubs, and melanoma. Whose heart will Sammi ""Sweetheart"" play jump-rope with next?

The problem arose when I saw people taking after it and acting like arrogant idiots.

I honestly like Dan Schneider's shows like iCarly and Victorious. They make me laugh. But this new ""how to rock"" show is garbage too. My recommendation, if you are looking for a good and fun show for your kids to watch that isn't painful for you to sit on in too, steer clear of big time rush and go for iCarly, Victorious, or even SpongeBob will do.

3,What the heck is this garbage? I'll tell you what it is. It's a disgrace to Nickelodeon. This is one of the shows that caused Nick to go downhill. Why? Read on.,2010
10,"I found this show because I was in between jobs and finally had time to watch TV. It reminded me at first of the Monkees, but has surpassed it in every way. ALL of the boys are incredibly talented and their true life friendships shine through and make their characters believable. While the situations are definitely all parody,the boys all sing beautifully as well as write many of their own songs.They have become huge, not just with teen girls, but people of all ages. Their kindness and willingness to put their fans first makes them not only top on my list of new talent (I would definitely go see them in concert if they came here) but on the top of an excellent example of young humanitarians. At their concerts they pay special attention to special needs children and their motto is that ALL people are beautiful. THAT is something I want my children to learn. These boys are wonderful role models and even though I am older than the average viewer, never miss an episode.",2013
10,"This Show is awesome. I like the music, i like the guys and it just goes to show that being a band in Hollywood isn't all it's cracked up to be. It's hard and you can see it throughout the show.My favorite guys are this order: James, Kendall, Carlos and Logan. just watch one show and you might like it.I like the singing, dancing, wisecracks and pretty much 4 friends trying to help each other out( or trying to be better then the others: JAMES)This show is just like MAKING THE BAND only this is different.I also like that if i miss a show, it will eventually pop up another day or i can catch it On Demand. I really like this show and i usually do like the Nick shows and i don't care that i'm 26.",2011
7,"So the show is for kids how old again? Last time I checked, a show on Nick was meant for pre-teens or younger, older if you're into that kind of stuff. Big Time Rush is a show for kids to understand. Would you ever tell your kid a ""that's what she said"" joke? If thats what makes you laugh, then this show is not for you. 30 to 50 year old won't think its funny, but unless it sends out the wrong message and teaches your kids what you rather them not learn, then don't watch it! In fact, the whole plot should inspire your kids to follow their dreams! Thats what they did and thats what it is meant to do. Funny- 6/10 Inspiring- off the charts! Big Time Rush, good in my book",2010
10,"Big Time Rush tells the fun and exciting story of four hockey players from Minnesota and how they made the big time. Where as some people think that Big Time Rush is either a Big Time Waste or a Big Time Fake, think. This show isn't just about fame and fortune, but this show also teaches our children that their dreams can be made possible and how much fun they can have.",2010
8,"This series is kind of sophomoric but it is also very funny. The four friends from Minnesota, hockey players at heart, get discovered as a singing group and are taken to Los Angeles for a demo. Of course the demo goes places and they get signed to a contract. They get put up at a fairly posh hotel along with one of the four's mother and younger sister. The younger sister, played very well by Ciara Bravo, is a bright spot with her smarts and ideas that she is always trying to turn a buck on. The mother is who keeps everyone grounded most of the time. Of course all four boys turn out to have girl problems at some point in the series and it is always cute and funny. At the start there are three girls at the hotel known as the Jennifer's because all are named Jennifer. They are stuck up and pretty as hell. They have since disappeared after a couple of seasons, I don't know why but it is a lose as far as I am concerned. Jo is Kendall's girlfriend and I can not get over her eyebrows at all. Lucy is back at the hotel and is after Kendall. If I were him I sure as hell would go for Lucy over Jo.",2013
2,I don't know how the 'hollywood' critic can claim to be a professional and give this show a good review. The jokes are lame and all of the plots can be traced to the Monkees.,2010
10,"""Big Time Rush"" is not your typical Nick/Disney show with the cookie-cutter performers groomed by the usual Disney/Nick hierarchy. These guys are down-to-earth, honestly funny guys. The writing has been great - although I must admit it totally reminds me of the old ""Monkees"" television series from the 1960's when I was a kid....but BETTER!! My kids (and husband) starting watching from the very first episode and I thought ""Uh oh...another brain-dead Zack & Cody/Hannah Montana/Jonas Bros. imitation."" I finally sat down to watch an episode and could NOT have been more wrong! It seems that a lot of the kids (girls AND boys) in the neighborhood are totally into them - no matter what age group (elementary, middle school, and YES, even high school). I highly recommend this television show. As can be seen from their store website (btrband.com), they are soooo sold out on their items because this group is so popular. In fact, it took me over two and a half months to get our T-shirt order (but it was well worth it). Give this show a try -- you will NOT be disappointed.",2011
5,"Obviously, anyone who was a kid or teen in the 70s will recognize this show...it is basically ""The Monkees"" redone for this generation. The guys...cute as they are...are trying to become famous..want to be serious performers and not screw up...but of course they do...ALL THE TIME! I have only seen and heard them a few times...thanks to the kids in my household....but I honestly think if you see one episode, you can figure out the plots for the next ones...they are all going to be basically the same...with a few extra things and or characters thrown in to mix it up a little. I know...it is NICK...and NICK like Disney in in the business of cranking out junk and then over promoting it ad nauseum. I know NICK was developed just for this reason...draw the kids in and keep them coming back...over and over...but Disney no longer is what Walt Disney entended it to be when he first opened Disneyland and Disneyworld. There is little original stuff coming out of that gate...including the actors and actresses they find and promote. All are fresh young faces, of course..but the seem to lack the real magic others from the past did. I doubt the memories of todays' kids will be as special as the ones kids have from watching the Disney of yesterday. That is kind of sad in a way. As for if any of these young stars remain stars after Disney and Nick days pass by...time will tell.",2010
10,Oh the first time I watched it was getting the DVD for ICarly I fight Shelby Marx.,2011
2,I've seen a few episodes of this show and I can say that this show is not good. It's pretty much a piece of crap. The episodes are not that good & well the characters are not good either. They do a lot of weird things and well. They're not thought out well. I really don't know what else to say. This show is not that good in my opinion. The only episodes I liked were the episodes that Tara Strong was in because I really like her. She's an awesome actress. The only other episode I liked was the Big Time Beach Party episode because Tom Kenny as Patchy The Pirate was in it from Spongebob & Spongebob is awesome. That's all so far. The only other good thing is Erin Sanders. Who was Quinn Pensky on Zoey 101.,2011
10,"Regular Show is a fitting title for a program that takes ordinary chores, such as preparing hot dogs, setting up chairs or cleaning a rain gutter and exaggerating the consequences of not performing said chores correctly. The main characters are a couple of slackers in their twenties who live only for the moment, even if that means getting fired. They constantly get into trouble due to their irresponsibility, but always manage to end up on top through some hilarious twist.",2011
10,"What do Monster Squad, Loverboy, Sylvester Stallone, Back to the Future, Bruce Campbell, 80s Hair Metal, and The Crying Game all have in common? They all have been a punchline, set-up, or reference in Regular Show.",2011
10,"I could not disagree more with the prior review. I find this show to be intelligent, pointed and (most importantly) hilarious. It pushes the bounds of traditional comedy, taking mundane situations and turning them into surreal adventures that actually challenge the notions of traditional story telling. The animation is crisp and playful with a certain joy that is hard to describe. And the odd universe it creates is one I am dying to live in. While the two main characters and their closest associates are all creatures/animals of various sorts, the rest of the world is recognizably human. This adds a mood of ""outsider"" to the adventures that makes them all the more clearly satire and farce.",2011
9,"This is a really hilarious show...duh. I feel like I shouldn't even have to point that out. When I watch the show, I feel like ""it's funny...because it's true"", you know what I mean? I just hope it doesn't go downhill the way some animated shows do. For instance, Spongebob Squarepants is a (children's) show that has a lot of crazy stuff happening in it, and then the makers of the show began to take the craziness too far (they pretty much milked it to death), and suddenly it just seemed not funny anymore. Everything moved too fast, and for little reason. The humor changed. I worry that a similar fate awaits Regular Show, because it happens to so many others. But if they keep making the show the way they do now, then they'll be fine. And maybe I'll even have my family play Regular Show in the mourning room at my funeral. Anyway, they're aren't a lot of shows reasonably directed at teenagers- you know, teenagers? The people between the stages of childhood and adulthood?- so this show is epic in that sense. It's also epic in all it's other senses.",2011
10,"J. G. Quintel, who many of you may know from The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack, delivers a new show that is truly hilarious. Recovering from a few truly putrid shows, such as the despicable ""Hero 108"", Cartoon Network has released this show, with many a good reason to watch. Firstly, spectacular voice cast. J. G. Quintel himself voices Mordecai, and William Salyers voices Rigby, his best friend. Mark Hamill (!!) is Skips, the duo's close friend. The rest of the cast is just so great at being their characters, no joke. These characters are the first in awhile to feel very real to me, with truth be told humor aimed at maybe slightly older kids, but I believe it's for the best. It's nowhere near vulgar, as some try to suggest, just good humor in general.",2011
10,"Plane and Simple, this cartoon is hilarious. If you've always wanted a cartoon that's kind of like the Hangover and Due Date, then this is perfect for you. First off, I've been buying every episode as soon as it's released on the PS3. Second, this cartoon came from a College project. Yes that's right, this cartoon was created from two project's that J.G. Quintel made for College (Two in the AMPM/Naive man in Lolliland). Third, this is not for kids, this is the cartoon to please those who loved the nineties cartoon network shows. The trailer was hilarious, not because they said ""Crotch"", but for the hilariousness off it. When I saw the episode, they get a keyboard that does everything and go to the moon. This is all in fifteen minutes and everything is crazy. So, let's recap. The cartoon was created from a college project, the cartoon is about guys in their twenties, and everything makes no sense. Also, a cartoon that gets about 2 million viewers per premiere episode, so obviously people like it and it's doing something right.",2011
10,"I think that, along with ""Phineas and Ferb"", ""Regular Show"" is one of the most promising cartoons from the recent years.",2011
10,"I saw the preview of this a few months before it was on. I was excited when I finally fiosed it and got to watch. It is so funny and simple to understand. Once you watch an episode or two you can almost tell what the main characters are going to do in when things happen. They are easy to like and laugh with. I was born in 85 and I have not been as excited about a cartoon in a long time. Go cartoon network go. I also like the new scooby doo cartoon as well as tower prep. Cartoon network is making great shows that people of any age can enjoy. It is good to know that shows are being made that families can watch together. So, go watch!!!!",2010
10,"I actually have been one of those mothers disheartened by the lack of innocence in modern children's programming, and as a conservative parent restricted a lot of what my kids watched when they were younger. They weren't watching Spongebob or the Cartoon Network stuff when other kids their age were. ",2011
9,"This show is one of the best cartoons and even overall shows in years. I have hardly any words to describe the greatness of this cartoon. I absolutely love this show! Characters are hilarious and when they say ""oooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhh"" it cracks me up every time. Plus there are always weird twists which make it that much more funny. Out of 10 I give this show a 10, out of 100, I give it a 100. It's absolutely perfect and pretty much every aspect of the show is spot on outstanding. The jokes are hilarious, the stories are funny, and the message in each episode is understanding. Pure Perfection! Overall I would easily recommend this phenomenal cartoon.",2012
8,"Hard to believe this came out before Adventure time, I sat that because I remember this show & AT were the 2 that brought CN out of the dark ages that were the recovering years of CN real, and it's great to still see it on strong today. This shows formula is to take a everyday or cliché problem and blow it out to universe endangering levels with stoner humor and a large amount of influence from the 80's. The show is about a giant blue jay and a regular sized raccoon working at a park while balancing work, personal live, slacking off and whatever insane threat they come across. This show also uses songs from the 80's and I sear I had to look up to see if this show was suppose to take place in the 80's(which it dose not). Speaking of 8o0's this show dose one thing that many other shows forget, references do not equal jokes. This show started off episodic but in more recent episode they real do build up some continuity not to adventure time's level but still pretty good and I do wish stuff like this can influence shows of the future. The show's more adult oriented humor isn't bad and kids can get a laugh when they make jokes that push the censors. Over all this show is really good it can have a nostalgic vibe even if you haven't seen it before and that's because it's pretty reminiscent of a cartoon form the 80's only with the writing of a show that's on know a days.",2016
9,"This is one of the craziest shows ever. Not only with good jokes for kids and adults, but also with crazy scenarios you'd never think could happen. Like hot dogs coming to life, how eating an omelet could save your friend or kill you, and how the game ""jinx"" could turn the people into black, demented zombies (No, not THAT black like racist like demon-like zombies. Not only are the scenarios great and fun, but so are the characters. Mordecai and Rigby are funny, but then there's Muscle Man, high-five ghost, Skips, Benson, pops, Margaret, Eileen. Even ""Giant beardo face""...oh! It's Garrett Bobby Ferguson😆. I grew up with this show and even going into it's 7th season, this show keeps getting funnier and grander. And, in my opinion, it's the most QUOTABLE show EVER! From ""My MOM!"" to ""Not setting the chairs next time!"", this show has so many memorable lines. And if any show's got all that, including Mark Hamill, this show is one of Cartoon Network's greatest shows. Heck, maybe one of the best shows ever! So, that's it. WOOO! Later, ladies!👍🏻",2015
8,"I think that overall, the show is really good. This is one of my top 3 favorite shows in my opinion and I do think there are positive and negative things about this show. The positive things are, well, I cannot state them all, but Regular Show seems to be amazing with special episodes like Christmas ones, Halloween ones, Thanksgiving ones. One of my negative things to say is that throughout the show, Rigby can be a big jerk to Mordecai and can even get away with it. Also, Season 4 and 5 have been going a bit downhill, but they're still good. I call it great entirely because the great seasons outnumber the good ones. This show competes with my other 2 favorites, Classic Spongebob and The Walking Dead. People say Adventure Time is the best show of CN, but I disagree. Adventure time is good, but doesn't have the charm Regular Show does, it's funny with its weirdness and not always random compared to Adventure Time. But both are great. Shows like Regular Show and Adventure Time trump every show of Cartoon Network, and too be honest, I think other shows like Amazing World of Gumball are overrated, but Regular Show is the king of CN in my opinion. I can't wait for Season 6 btw.",2014
10,"After normally skipping this show on CN to watch things like Adventure Time and Gumball, one day I began to get quite bored of watching the same 3 Adventure Time episodes over and over (the episodes being 'Her Parents', 'From Bad To Worse' and 'Mystery Train'), I finally thought 'why not' and watched Regular Show. And I realised what I was missing. In a word 'Great'. Regular Show combines silly humour and fart jokes with the sort of comedy that makes you think ""what the heck is happening here"". J.G Quintel has made a masterpiece. The only downside I have to this show is that some episodes (Like 'Jinx' and 'But we have a receipt') are really not for kids, for example, in the episode'Jinx' one of the main characters (Mordocai) Jinxes his friend Rigby and the entire plot line of the episode is Rigby trying to find ways to unjinx himself, which seems OK, until the end. One of the other main characters (Muscle Man) tricks Rigby into thinking that he can write his name backwards on a mirror to unjinx himself, so of course he try's it, only for a dark demented creature to come flying out of the mirror, almost killing Rigby, what follows may be quite disturbing for kids. But apart from that, an amazing TV show. 10/10",2013
9,"Regular Show is a cartoon series made by J.G Quintel for the channel Cartoon Network. It premiered on the 6th of September and is a series that revolves around two slacking groundskeepers at the local park, trying to turn their regular days into amazing adventures. they are Mordecai, a blue jay, and Rigby, a raccoon. Mordecai is a responsible, kind, respectful and fun-loving kind of guy. He's is willing to take on any kind of responsibility you give him. He also has a enormous crush on Margaret, a red robin who works at the local coffee shop. in episodes such as Bad Kiss and Do or Diaper, Mordecai tries to make his move on her, but regrets or gets shot down at the last minute. Rigby is the complete opposite of Mordecai. He's selfish, lazy, obnoxious and a complete idiot. He's a bad friend to Mordecai since he is better than Rigby in most ways. But they always come through for each other in the end. Regular Show. It's Anything But. OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!",2013
9,"As a huge animation fan, I heard much about Regular Show, mostly positive but with some negatives too. I am so glad that I gave it a chance because in my opinion Regular Show is one of the funnier and better recent shows on Cartoon Network alongside Adventure Time and Chowder.

10,I don't wanna exaggerate but there are so many things I want to say about Regular Show. First of all I wasn't impressed of it when I saw it for the very first time. I was so unsure about it not because of it's rudeness but I didn't think it was going to be so funny in the way of my sense of humor. But I gave it a second chance not only opening my mind but also finding about for what humor it delivers. And the result: Funny as heck!,2014
10,"I saw a video on YouTube labeled Mario is the greatest piece of Subrealist art. It claimed that it is based on seemingly random factors that manage to sort of work. I believe Regular Show captures this very essence. You may say ""then why did you not pick Adventure Time or Phineas and Ferb"" well I also took in mind the ability in this show to have something based on some slackers and a regular story on Regular Show and transform it into these crazy surrealist adventures that are seemingly random and together for a solid plot. That is the key to becoming the greatest piece of Subrealist art. I also love Adventure Time for the nostalgia.",2013

Mordecai is the ""responsible one"" who always gets in trouble by his boss Benson, because of Rigby being lazy and not working. I love how the title is ""Regular Show"" But everything is irregular, because each episode has this crazy impossible event which includes monsters, magic, powers, and funny jokes. . Hey, it's anything but! This show and Adventure time just SAVED cartoon network from it's other bad shows (except the old cartoon network shows). But only if they made more shows on cartoon network like this. I mean seriously, what's with teen titans go? I like the old one better. And what is with the show incredible crew? J.G Quintel (creator of regular show) and Pendleton Ward(creator for Adventure Time) should make more and betters shows like this.",2013

8,"Spread is an unusual little film. I say 'little', as it's essentially a low budget character-driven drama that is some how being commercially packaged as a rom-com. A quick glance at the credits reveals that this isn't your average Kutcher vehicle: it's directed by Scotland's David Mackenzie of ""Young Adam"" and ""Hallam Foe"" fame. ",2009
3,"An American Gigolo for the 21st century, although without the '80's morality and sense of excess. Spread is a heavy handed and patently nasty ode to 21st century values of greed and excess. Demi Moore's toy boy Ashton Kutcher is perfectly cast here as Nikki, a handsome, vacuous, arrogant but impoverished stud who seduces wealthy, lonely older women and sponges off them while giving them an enjoyable sexual experience. He is currently sharing the lavish Hollywood Hills mansion of 40ish lawyer Samantha (Anne Heche). But while she is away on business he beds a number of younger more insatiable girls. But he remains emotionally detached, and never lets anyone get too close to him. That changes when he meets Heather (Margarita Levieva), a waitress who works in a coffee shop. But Heather is the female equivalent, coasting through life and living off the largesse of wealthy older men. But Heather is even more complicated than that. When Nikki falls hard for her it is a relationship that will change his life. Spread is an undeniably handsome-looking production, but it is rather vapid and empty. We've been through that younger man/older woman vibe too many times in the past (Shampoo, Sunset Boulevard, etc) to be seduced by the rather lacklustre version of the story served up here. Working with director David MacKenzie (Young Adam, etc), first time screenwriter Jason Hill serves up a morality tale in which the narcissistic young stud eventually gets his comeuppance. Kutcher may get by on his pretty boy looks but his performance is flat and he brings little depth to a character who is pretty shallow to begin with. There are oodles of flesh on display here, but the coldly staged sex scenes fail to generate much heat.",2009
5,"I was surprised to find so many descriptions for this movie describing it or tagging it as a comedy... by my reckoning it's more of a light drama expressing the costs of inconsiderate over-indulgence. The players and performers all did their job as one would hope in any movie, but emptiness in the script and storyline left me wishing I'd spent my time more productively. I can't speak to any sense of realism in it, but perhaps there are worldly examples I'm simply unaware of. I did enjoy a few aspects of it, but there's little in the way of empathy that one can generate for the characters within as they're all between 'hollow & insensitive' and 'dishonest & abusive'.",2011
7,"I was hesitant at first to watch this movie. First it was the name, spread. I assumed it was going to be about fashion models and magazines or something lame like that. Second Ashton Kutcher is in it, not a selling point for me. But I was actually surprised with this movie. Ashton isn't his normal character in this film. To me it seems like he is going for a Hayden Christensen sorta thing. Most of the other characters in this film are bleak to say the most. They just kinda come and go with out any attachment, well from the viewers perspective at least. Anne Heche is super hot in this movie. I could never really feel for her though in this movie. I guess it was just the way she reacted to the situations at hand. I did love the pothead roommate though! It was hilarious hearing her cough in the distance. And the fact that she never came out of her room, I can relate with that. Well I liked this movie and it actually got better throughout the movie. Check it out if you have an hour and a half to kill.",2009
1,I must have missed the boat somewhere.,2009
2,Nothing new here. A story that happens ever day to people that you won't particularly care about. ,2010
5,I suppose Anton Kutcher must be handsome. He's tall and dark and every woman who approaches him seems to melt into some kind of amorphous plastic object that wobbles towards the nearest bed and begs him for commands.,2011
8,"After reading a few reviews, I expected this movie to be a mildly pornographic rom-com. As the credits scrolled, however, I was surprised to find that this movie was not only well made and well casted, but the story behind well thought out too. Although some aspects of the story were clearly unreal (like the glamour and ease with which Ashton Kutcher picked up women), I thought that some things portrayed in Spread were rather accurate. One idea, which Nicky (Kutcher) mentions several times, is how people run to LA to pursue their dreams- but how the reality is that nothing is quite as magic as it seems. Most movies, having been made in Hollywood, would not necessarily incorporate this into the story. But this movie daringly features not only this but other controversial issues, and is therefore quite thought provoking. On the surface I can see why people thought the scenes of sexual nature were unnecessary, but really, the sex was part of the story. It was showing what Ashton Kutcher, who plays a gigolo, did to survive. And it showed how meaningless it all way for him. Overall I really enjoyed this film, and think that it carries a much deeper meaning than one would presume.",2011
7,"While Spread certainly wasn't a popular film when it was released, it didn't fly by my eye and it caught my attention for some reason, and I had been wanting to see it for awhile. When I got to view it, I was actually pretty satisfied with what I saw. The movie itself is quite well done and though it's apathetic and dull around the edges, the main story is strong and effective. The acting from both Ashton Kutcher and Anne Heche is great and believable, in my opinion, and though all the characters certainly weren't breathtakingly astonishing, they were actually well done enough to where I enjoyed them and I thought they were interesting and likable.",2010
8,"I enter the film without too higher expectations. I though it would not be worth my while. Yet it became clear quickly the acting and attraction of the film was a lot better that I had original anticipated. I am proud to say that by the end I was truly impressed and moved; particularly by the ending and Ashton Kutcher acting as Nikki. Spread is a film with a story not dissimilar to other erotic thrillers. The character of Nikki is not unlike the character of Daniel Day-Lewis in The Unbearable Lightness of Being. Yet in spite of the film seeming simplicity, Spread has a lot more to offer than at first glance. Nikki, (Ashton Kutcher) is a character who is very dependant on other people. He almost feed of the women he meets as if he is a parasite. Although from an external point of view Nikki is a heartless creature, through out the film one is pulled into him whether willing or not.",2010
5,"I thought this movie to be a comedy, as it was labeled such, so I was sort of waiting for a movie to make me laugh. The movie ""Spread"", however, is not really a comedy, more like a drama. But it wasn't a bad movie at all.",2011
3,"Spread is just basically a film where Ashton Kutcher gets to show-off and gets around to seeing a lot of pretty women fleshed and taking advantage of them. Its a sex comedy with enough sex and not enough comedy nor smarts to deliver. The movie sets its tone in the first few minutes with Ashton (Nikki) reading his first line while walking around. ""I don't want to be arrogant, but I'm an incredibly attractive man,"" he informs by his dry narration – he ingratiates himself into the lives of rich older women to gain access to good clothes, fine food and luxurious living.",2010
2,"This movie was dreadful. Firstly, Ashton Kusher may be suitable to play jovial roles in tawdry sitcoms; however, he lacks the talent to assume more serious parts. The main character in Spread is a young cad named Nikki (Kusher), who narrates about the complexities of living in Los Angeles. Yet his narration is mostly a collection of meaningless quotes that make him sound like a buffoon trying to appear knowledgeable. ",2010
1,"I watched this movie with my boyfriend, thinking it might be OK. We were so very wrong. Everything from the plot to the acting was just awful. I am usually a fan of Ashton, but this was just crap. I can never look at suspenders the same way again---why did he have to wear them in EVERY single scene? In terms of the plot, it was so predictable once you understood what was going on. Watching Ashton live out of a garbage bag and whore himself out to Anne Heche was certainly not something we had prepared ourselves for on date night. I also like Anne Heche, but I really did not need to see her naked. Not too mention, the whole vaginal-reconstruction thing was a bit much for us.If you consider yourself even slightly intelligent, do not watch this movie.",2010
7,"Within the first 5 minutes of opening, I thought Ashton really chose poorly in accepting this role; he chose a role too close to what he is perceived as in real life. First and foremost in my mind, he's an ex model hottie. Secondly, he has never seemed like the sharpest tool in the shed based on the roles he's played. Thirdly, I wonder would he be where he ""is"" today without Demi? He saunters in, first scene, looking like a cross between a gay hairdresser and a wanna be edgy member of Green Day. He's talking smack about how beautiful he is, and how he's ridden on the coat tails of his charm and appearance and sexed his way around LA. Boy, I thought, I'm glad these tickets were free...",2009
8,"I really enjoyed the movie despite the fact that it was advertised as ""romantic comedy"" with the title translated to Russian as ""Babnik"" (Womanizer). Yes, there are so much sex and ""glamour"" in the beginning; nevertheless, the real story begins afterwards – the one that is worth to see, and that is NOT a romantic comedy. The story of the closed doors. The story of selling the expensive staff for nothing. The story of the beginning and the end of love. ""You are a dreamer, and it is scaring me"", says the girl to Nicky, and this is so true. Nicky is the man without a plan, without friends, he survives because of the attractive appearance, that will not remain over time. That's why ""Spread"" is the real drama of dreamer's collision with the reality that he tried to ignore so far.",2009
5,"Spread tries to be hollow, vacuous, shallow, and then tries to be more and cannot make the spread.",2009
1,This film is about a guy who seduces women in order to live from them. He was a parasite who didn't even had a job in his whole life. I think that the producers didn't take advantage of ideas like these (Even if there was too little to take advantage in the first place).,2010
6,"For 75 years we have seen talkies about young handsome and pretty hopefuls who come to Hollywood and lick their way to the top of something only to find they shoulda stayed home. This film isn't a talkie so much as a screwy. From DAY OF THE LOCUST and A STAR IS BORN and others, notably American GIGOLO we cinema-goers have sought the sight of these pretty prostitutes doing their thing..... and this time we have Ashton Kutcher (and Anne Heche) fully nude for your viewing pleasure. Exactly how much of a pleasure is doubtful, but this film SPREAD which he co produced is mostly all for and about him. Other viewers might be hard on this film (unlike Ashton, I am sure) and the material is familiar, but the production values and his unflinching willingness to get his gear off a lot is clearly to refresh the tired storyline and the awful personalities of the parasitic behavior on screen. Kutcher is quite good as the toy boy involved, and Heche is the hot momma host and their interaction (so to speak) works. There is a lot of nude on screen sex in this film all photographed lushly in semi tropic patio heaven. It's fun and trashy and well made and you get to see bits of everyone not normally in the sunlight. SPREAD, like Kutcher is nice to look at and quite familiar but ultimately empty. There is a better version yet to be made of this idea that these 20 something nightclub people who are good looking realise they are just delivery staff. As they say, be nice to those who you meet on the way up....",2010
8,"This film is a great example of what the L.A. social life is really like... drivin' by male a dominated mind frame where you can have whatever you want as long as you play the rules of the land. If you got it you ""got it"" if not the you don't, its that simple. this movie really made me feel the superficialness of how Los Angeles really is. I loved how they played on the idea of a playboy womanizer who can have whatever he wants, then broke the dudes' back like a ton of bricks. life in the fast lane is really like that where you can feel so high and so low the next minute in a ""town"" like Hollywood. Kutcher played a great role in the story with his lack-a-daisical sense of being in all aspects of the current character. This is a very true story of how Hollywood ""can"" pick u up and spit u out in the same breath as easy as a gasp of air, no matter how ""big"" u feel. Its really when u step back and look at the story when you see the big picture, where u see the irony and the brilliance of the role of kutcher. It's almost sad how the end is, even though u know it is coming sooner than later. The end is fitting for the picture seeing that Hollywood is really like that, An Open Book, never closed cause there is still hope in the system of which Hollywood consists of. Forget your ""friends"" and be a ""Dreamer"" like how the Hollywood fancy is really like. Great Film in my opinion. Shot with great views of the city, with beautiful people, and a story that doesn't stay still, it's just the inevitable ending that makes this story sort of cliché.",2010
2,"I lost a whole lot of respect for Ashton, and this movie and everyone in it and who likes it, within the first 10 minutes the movie started rolling. I'm a big Ashton fan, and this movie was the finale to an Ashton movie marathon, and boy was it a huge letdown. Not only was his acting pretty terrible (there may have been some salvation of his acting if it weren't for the lifetime- drug-addict voice he had throughout the movie), but there's zero point to this movie. The first 40 minutes are basically porn. I don't know about everyone else, but a pseudo-love story about two prostitutes falling in love is pretty pathetic, not to mention pretty morally gross. It was also entirely offensive to women, as well as men who have some sort of moral depth. The last half is the only decent half (hence the rating of 2), as it's not all raunchy sex, cocky men, and Ashton in his dumb suspenders.",2010
2,"This movie ranks in my top five worst movies I have ever seen. I assume the producers thought the movie would sell on the basis of graphic sex and nudity. That being said, I should have watched a porn movie (as the acting would have been better). ",2009
7,"The city of Los Angeles plays a prominent character in ""Spread"", a movie that certainly spreads the word that Los Angeles is not exactly angelic for everybody; even though it can be if you got the right plan of action, as least for a while it can. That leads us to the protagonist of ""Spread"", the homeless & carless Nikki portrayed by Ashton Kutcher. Nikki uses his physical good-looks to prey on the wealthy single women of L.A. so he can spread his orgasmic juices inside them, then in turn they can spread their home & car over to him. My hero! Kidding! One of Nikki's premier so-called victims would be the cougar-honey Samantha, who after meeting Nikki at a club, takes him to her gorgeous Hollywood Hills home and seduces the hill I mean hell out of him. Before you can say ""I Slammed Sam"", Nikki stays in her home for days and even drives her dazzling Mercedes Benz. Nikki still keeps hustling to the sexual tussling even though he temporarily lives in Samantha's home. He even throws a party when she is out of town so he can escalate the female body count. So for the first half of the ""Spread"", the aforementioned was the film's appealing portion. I expected a shift in the narration of the film, nothing great last forever for any main protagonist of a movie. But this could of have been done so much better! Cause all of a sudden, Director David MacKenzie spreads ""Spread"" into a feeble romantic narrative. That is when Nikki meets Heather, a coffee shop waitress who derails Nikki unexpectedly, and does have some secrets of her own; secrets that were so quite obvious that it spread like wildfire what they were as I was watching the movie. Ha? Hey, leave me alone! I am spreading it thick, pun style. I do credit MacKenzie for his vision of exhibiting the story of a serial womanizer in Los Angeles, and using the city as a central focus in that architecture. But again when Heather enters the spread, the film becomes an obtuse romance that you can care less how it develops and concludes. Jason Dean Hall's screenplay was rich in style during the first act of the film, but then when the Nikki & Heather romance was introduced the scribe was converted into a silly romantic contrivance. That Asthon acting show was not half-bad in his starring performance here compared to his past acting, but that is not a spread stretch. What the Heche? Anne Heche is back! She was exquisite as the sexually-driven Samantha. However, her counterpart female lead in the film Margarita Levieva was atrocious as the staid Heather. OK, I am tired of spreading my viewpoints of ""Spread"". Please spread the news on the mediocrity of ""Spread"". *** Average",2010
1,"First off, I like Ashton Kutcher's acting abilities. I liked him in 'That 70's Show', 'Butterfly Effect' and especially 'Dude, Wheres my Car'. So now here the problem. The acting in this film was terrible, led by Kutcher. I found it hard to believe he was a gigolo. His narration was monotone, his wardrobe, though not his fault was laughable and quite unrealistic if not downright leftover clothes from his sitcom. We are led to believe that Anne Heche aka Samantha , who is a successful businesswoman, would just be instantly duped by Kutcher and just be reduced to a nymphomaniac with a lower back tattoo, laughable in its own right. This story is just fantasy. In all fairness, it did not pretend to be true. That is fair enough. What is not fair, is that women in this film, are treated like just sexual objects that are mindless, stupid and quite frankly not likable at all. Then again, Most of the characters in this film were about as unlikable as gets. This film was just a mish-mash of negative female stereotypes and would make one believe that the women in this film are the rule not the exception. Though the exception , would be far fetched as well. There was no originality in this film and yes though it had the come-uppance element, it still did not do enough to make me actually enjoy this overly sexed and overly clichéd film. It was non-interesting,non-fun and just an effort that should be forgotten ASAP.",2010
7,"I need to get my biggest criticism for ""Funny People"" out of the way here at the beginning: it is not the movie the marketing campaign would lead you to believe it is. While it is true of the ads that this film is more than just a comedy and that it contains some heavy themes involving a near-death experience, it would be more accurately described as a dark drama punctuated by some very funny lines. But I suppose that doesn't get people in to see the movie.",2009
4,"It's difficult to imagine what was in Judd Apatow's mind. A serious comedy of sorts? Adam Sandler is at the center of the confused attempt. He's better than he's ever been in a part that is, quite frankly, disagreeable to say the list. This creature that has achieved fame and fortune but without building any interior life. A bum, ignorant, silly, self pitying, spoiled, uneducated, moronic and I could go on but I guess you get the picture. The strange thing is that the story is structured in such a way that seems to imply we're suppose to feel for him even feel identified by his predicament. He's told he has a fatal disease at the beginning of the film but then miraculously he gets better and then you have another hour of film in which new characters are introduced. I wanted to run out of the theater and scream. There are a few funny moments and Jason Schwartzman and Eric Bana are very good but,somebody please tell me, what the hell was this?",2009

2,"The first hour and a half was fairly entertaining, funny one-liners, exactly what I was expecting. Then the scene when Adam Sandler's Character goes to visit his former girlfriend's house. It dragged ON, and ON, and ON, and so forth. It was like the tempo of the movie went from snappy to outright boring and annoying. There were at least 15-20 minutes where nobody in our almost sold-out crowd laughed. Terrible.",2009
1,"This film really disappointed me. First of all, the script was poor and gave the story no real focus at all.I have enjoyed the directors previous work and was expecting something a little different, having seen the previews.The main problem for me was Adam Sandler.The relationship between Sandler and Rogen seemed a little forced, but this was probably from the stagnant script. Apatow didn't use Jonah Hill nearly enough and the fact that Ira's character went behind his friends back, seemed kind of stupid.",2009
1,"A cross Between Terms Of Endearment and a Dice Clay stand-up act, Funny People is a vanity project taken to pathological and psychotic extremes. One gets the impression Apatow's motivation for making this was to inflict psychological torture upon his viewers. The film stars Adam Sandler as a man who you know will be dying at the end of the film, so the movie starts out with raunchy dialog that would make Kevin Smith blush, then abruptly shifts gears by emotionally manipulating the audience using tearjerker plot techniques typically used in the average Lifetime Movie of the Week. ",2009
4,"I went in with high hopes expecting this to be very entertaining and sure enough, I was in for a treat! Seth Rogen and Adam Sandler were in perfect sync with each other and had some very funny jokes that were not only witty but very good. Even the theme of a near death experience seemed to really fit in with the movie.But after the first hour and a half and Sandler being cured, the film just dragged. I found it very odd that after Sandler was cured, there was little to no mention of him being cured after he initially tell everybody, then goes back to being the same jerk he's always been. It just didn't make any sense of what someone who just went through a near death experience would really do. Then here was a lot of pointless drivel about his ex married to an Australian dude that Sandler was trying to get back, how he still loved her, blah blah blah,and he still doesn't get the girl in the end! All while he's with the girl, him and Rogen get into a huge fight and then they're just done.What was that??? I kept thinking ""What happened?"" The duo that Sandler and Rogen portrayed so wonderfully from before fell apart, and the film just ceased to be funny.If the film would've ended after Sandler gets cured, I'd easily say Best Film of the Year, but because they had to goon and on for almost another hour and a half about something that had almost nothing to do with the story really killed Funny People for me. If you're going to see it, I suggest going for the first hour and a half then leaving because if you stay, get ready to pull out a pillow and get a good almost hour of snooze.",2009

While comedy king Judd Apatow attempts something different he misses the mark completely: entertaining.

Seth Rogen is a d-list sitcom star who has unfathomably been given parts in Hollywood films. Adam Sandler is truly terrible and simply isn't a funny man which is unfortunate considering he does comedy. Happy Gilmore and Big Daddy had a certain charm but Sandler has lost that charm a long time ago and should really stop inflicting himself on the world. There is no story to this film just whiny, thoroughly unlikeable characters whinging their way through 2 and a half hours of nothingness.

At one point or another, every director that hits the peak of popularity will attempt to make that major, perfect film. With Baz Luhrmann it was ""Australia."" With Sergio Leone it was ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly."" With Charlie Chaplain it was ""The Great Dictator."" With James Cameron it was ""Titanic."" With Ridley Scott it was ""Gladiator."" With D.W. Griffith it was ""Intolerance."" And of course, with Spielberg, he had more than one attempt with ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""A.I."" as examples.

9,"This film is certainly not Apatow's best. It seems people are giving it a bad rep because its (truth be told) a little too long, but the length doesn't take away from the content. I think this film is an explanation about many comedians, not all, but many. It shows how comedy is often drawn from depression, inadequacies, a persons internal pains expressed through comedy. This film is fantastic in my mind, it contains the humor, along with the drama, and while it may not top ""40 year old.."" or ""Knocked Up' it was wonderful. Expect some great cameos. great acting, enjoyable story-line, and the same Apatow crew that we now know and love.

The relationships were nicely intertwined without being contrived (""Crash"" anyone?), and unlike the similar movie ""Love Actually,"" nothing portrayed was too outlandish. The convention of adding comments by ""real"" people to introduce story lines was well done and amusing. If I find any fault with the film, it's that all of the guys are presented as having relationship ""issues"" or as being total bone-heads.

Where is Robert Altman when you need him? I found it extremely hard to relate to or to find sympathy for the characters. Some of their actions were so unbelievably stupid that I just wanted to smack them. And what shallow lives they lived! Work, bar-hopping and texting. Character development was equally shallow. What epiphany did the Justin Long character undergo to realize that he was really ""into"" the Ginnifer Goodwin character? One confused meeting with the wait staff does not an epiphany make. The same goes for the Jennifer Aniston character realizing what a catch Ben Affleck's character was. So he washed some dishes. And why did he suddenly want to marry her....Because she suddenly didn't want to??? I would have thrown that engagement ring at his head. And what did the Jennifer Connelly character ever see in that wishy-washy (although good-looking) chump of a husband? The Scarlett Johansson character needed some serious therapy for that self-involvement problem of hers (or maybe a good slap upside the head).

The movie portrays women has whiny, desperate, and pathetic creatures who do nothing besides gossip and give each other relationship pep talks. The scenes where Jennifer Anniston, Jennifer Connelly, and Ginnifer Goodwin are in the office where they are employed are perfect examples of this. Despite being educated, professional women, instead of working, they spend all their time discussing their relationships and consoling one another. As a young adult male I can honestly say that this is the kind of portrayal of women which makes men not take them seriously. The fact that women support and like this movie only gives further credence to these clearly prejudiced beliefs. So again how can women support a movie which portrays them so poorly? It makes about as much sense to me as Muslims supporting a movie about three young, college educated Arab men who work in the same office and spend all of their time making bombs and planning terrorist attacks.

As she is set up by friends and co-workers, she often takes a shine to her dates but, frequently, the gentlemen involved never call her again. This could be, in part, because Gigi leaves phone and text messages for her dates to the point of scaring any caring men away. Meanwhile, a married twosome, Ben and Janine (Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Connelly) are restoring a lovely townhouse but having personal problems. This is compounded by the fact that hubby meets a yoga instructor-aspiring singer, Anna (Scarlett Johanssen) at a corner grocery and is smitten. Despite his protestations that he is married, the two meet again. Also in the ""raven"" city is a longtime-together couple, Beth (Jennifer Aniston) and Neil (Ben Affleck) who are at odds, too, for Beth longs for marriage and Neil, despite his love for his lady, doesn't care for formalities. Finally, bar manager Alex (Justin Long) cynically gives advice to Gigi about men, real estate salesman Conor (Kevin Connolly) pines for Anna and newspaper ad-lady Mary (Drew Barrymore) is trying to make a love connection for herself, too. Will these fine folks get their ""hearts desires"" when it comes to amour? This is a fine, fine romantic comedy with an edge often missing from the standard fare. Yes, the characters in this film are searching for happily ever after but learn that reality may fall a bit short, sometimes. The ensemble cast is truly wonderful, with all of the actors giving nice turns as the romance seekers. But, then, they all have great lines to deliver, as the script is loaded with truth, laughs, and pathos. One surprise is that the Baltimore setting is absolutely lovely, especially the fine old apartment buildings where the characters dwell and the beautiful coast. Seeing these venues might tempt someone to book their next mini-vacation in this fine old town. However, the costumes are a mixed-bag, with Johannsen appearing gorgeous beyond measure and Goodwin looking fine, too, but J. Connelly sporting clothes that stifle her great beauty. On the other hand, the film's snappy direction and fine production values are assets. The bottom line is that while the film will please romcom enthusiasts it will also entertain those who usually attend movies of this genre with reluctance.

But due to the poor description of each personality in the script, all of them look rather foolish and shallow. Everybody may not live alone, so the theme in this film must be important.

I'm also impressed with the many layers to this movie, and its insight into the MANY LAYERS OF HUMAN DYNAMICS which are so often over-looked by superficial contemporary social society.

6,"so i went into this film not really knowing much about the story behind it, other then in the previews drew berrymore says something on the lines of 'he myspaced me' and then began to discuss flirting while texting. its funny to think that we all do it, we're in this huge generation who relies on technology to get our information and be our key resource to the outside world. it almost seamed as if i was watching a TV show with all of the different story lines going on. jumping from one story to the other was difficult to keep my focus, it seamed almost as if once i began to care about one character and put together the pieces of their problem, the story ended and went on to another character and their issue. the movie however did flow well, and the cast is HUGE with a ton of big name characters. it was definitely a movie i would take my girlfriends to see. it did run rather long however, about an hour into the movie i found myself loosing focus. however, that is when the story is starting to get good with the whole cheating aspect and loosing the one you begin to care about. cute movie, 6 out of 10.",2009
7,"I saw this film with a group of people. A female friend of mine didn't like the picture because she thought it portrayed all the women negatively. I did not have that reaction but ironically thought it portrayed all men as shallow. Anyway, it was a nice, light film. Nothing ground breaking but worth a pleasant evening out. My only criticism, the makers of this film made Jennifer Connelly look physically unappealing. As she is one of the most beautiful women around, they must have worked very hard to obtain that misque.",2009
6,"I went to see this movie after being a HUGE fan of the book. I enjoyed it because, although the points were a bit exaggerated at times, I could identify with the characters. I have dated the commitment phobes, the married man (who conveniently forgot to mention that), the guy who just wanted me around to ""cuddle"" but couldn't think of having sex with me. The movie shed light on all these things in a way that makes you realize how ridiculous relationships can be. I thought the acting was good. The character Gigi was a bit 'over the top', but everyone played their parts in a believable fashion. I enjoyed it, and recommend it as a girls night out- probably not a couple movie.",2009
10,"This sumptuous ensemble romantic comedy managed to exceed my expectations in every way. It was extremely hilarious and utterly realistic, and features an eclectic cast that all add something different to this intriguing tale of dealing with the pitfalls of dating and marriage.",2009
1,"The opening scene to the film was a good set up, the idea behind the film is very true, I think most people have experienced this at some point in their lives, however, after about the first fifteen minutes maybe even less, it takes that premise and turns it into predictable, soppy and corny. There are some notable mentions I think, Drew Barrymore's brief cameo had some funny bits in it, and I also enjoyed Jennifer Connolly's performance, although due to the amount of characters, these two did not get enough screen time.",2009
7,"I happened to see this movie with my wife on Valentine's day. I had entered the theater with low expectations and the only reason I was keen to watch this was because of Ben Affleck and host of other starts. However, as the movie progressed I found myself starting to like it. By the time it ended I was glad it didn't turn out to be just another stupid romantic comedy made to pull the audiences with big stars.",2009
8,"Since I'd expected mainly ""fluff"", I was very pleasantly surprised to discover that this film was instead an unusually WELL-DONE ensemble piece. There's a bunch of periodically-intertwined stories of different people looking for, avoiding and trying to improve love in their lives, with unanticipated twists, turns and revelations along the way. GINNIFER GOODWIN plays a needy woman who naively believes the lines she's fed, and JUSTIN LONG tries to clue her in reality-wise. JENNIFER ANISTON & BEN AFFLECK play a long-term couple with problems. SCARLETT JOHANSSON flits in & out of the lives of numerous people including KEVIN CONNOLLY & BRADLEY COOPER. DREW BARRYMORE, JENNIFER CONNELLY, KRIS KRISTOFFERSON and others effectively add to the mix. As a friend commented, he'd expected this to be a chick flick, & instead it was an unexpectedly thought-provoking and telling commentary on life today, with characters who strongly reminded him of numerous people he HIMSELF knows. While a drama, it's got a good deal of inherent humor, fine acting, and you'll likely find it strongly enjoyable.",2009
9,"Awesome Swedish film with a intelligent story. a journalist and a troubled young female hacker works together on resolving a 40 year old mystery involving a disappearance, murders, Nazis and one hell of a dysfunctional family. the storytelling by the director was great and captured my attention for almost 2,5 hours. the character buildup is thorough and makes a solid foundation for the rest of the film. in addition the characters are straightened by a superb cast played by Michael Nyqvist and especially Noomi Rapace. Camera work and the overall look of the film is astounding, especially on bluray. the movie takes you to it's locations and doesn't let go until the story is complete. a must see for those who likes an intriguing edge of your seat thriller.",2009
9,"I went to see this film having heard nothing about it at all and another film I wanted to see wasn't on the Sunday matinée bill...so, this looked interesting...best 5 Euros I've spent in a long time. Very, very good thriller but NOT FOR CHILDREN and I was genuinely surprised how much I enjoyed it - well filmed and well acted by the main protagonists; I know nothing of Swedish actors but apparently Michael Nyqvist is well known and I thought Noomi Rapace was brilliant (a young, headstrong, tattooed and ""talented"" computer hacker Lisbeth Salander with a traumatized past) I thought the film was superbly directed (Niels Arden Oplev); I am already looking forward to the second film later this year AND I will go and buy the books...",2009
9,"This film was very well-made with superb cinematography. The actors all portray their respective characters perfectly, although Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander, Michael Nyqvist as Michael Blomkvist and Sven-Bertil Taube as Hanrik Vanger deserve a special mentioning. They are all very likable and believable.",2009
7,"An intrigue fueled slow building thriller, ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" is a refreshingly different take on the ""whodunit"" crime genre. This Swedish movie has loads of great cinematography, taking advantage of the beautiful Swedish country side as well as framing the eerie story. The principal characterizations are quite well suited by the cast who fit naturally in the roles they play with great realism. Like I have already noted this is a much different presentation as compared with American filmed crime thrillers. Even though this obviously has a well-funded budget it is grittier and less commercialized thus lending a realism over glossiness. The music score also adds quite a bit of ominous darkness.",2009
7,"I am among, I guess, those very few people in Europe who have not read the best-selling novel by Stieg Larsson, but, not feeling in the mood to see another too emotionally engaging romance or drama, although its being my favourite genre, I went to see what is depicted by Larsson's fans as a captivating and gripping thriller.",2009
8,"The music lends a threatening aspect to the opening scene, where we in slow close ups  on and off deliberately out of focus  get to follow the opening of a package. Inside the package, post marked in Hong Kong, is a framed plant. The camera starts to move backwards, taking in more of the room and revealing Sven-Bertil Taube as the opener of the package. He holds the frame in his hands, lowers his head and slowly starts to cry.",2009

It is based on the first book in Stieg Larsson's crime trilogy with the main characters journalist Mikael Blomkvist and outcast hacker Lisbeth Salander. For the record, this trilogy has had rave reviews and been among the best selling books in Scandinavia. ",2009
10,"I saw this movie in Sydney, Australia and it was really great. A really good thriller!. I have read all three of the books and wondered how the movie would be. The theatre was packed and it was in subtitles but you could hear a pin drop. We were all glued to the screen. Once it gets going your are hooked! At the end everyone clapped. Some of the scenes are graphic and violent but if you have read the book you already know this. However, even though I had to ""read"" the movie I cant wait for the next one. At least I hope they are making a movie for book 2 and 3 I would not take my 14yr old to this but it is something I would see again. Highly recommend!",2010
8,"While I haven't read the books/novels, I enjoyed the movie very much. Even if it's only part 1 of the trilogy, it still feels like a movie that has a beginning and an ending. I can't say how that works in the books, but the translation to the screen seems really good (voting here underlines that).",2009
8,"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo has been a worldwide phenomenon for a while now. In book form, the original film, and the Hollywood remake. It is a disturbing, yet riveting tale, as is the story behind the author who made it. While Fincher's version is visually and stylistically more striking, I feel this original Swedish film does a better job bringing the disturbing mystery to the silver screen. Structured much more fluidly than the Hollywood version, the mystery of a missing girl flows and develops slowly, dishing out red herrings and suspense with each turn (something lacking in the Fincher version). It also stays closer to the original title of the book (and theme) Men who Hate Women. In the end, this is a dark tale of what rape does to women and to the world. Not everyone's idea of 'entertainment,' but a thought-provoking mystery for those with strong stomachs.",2012
10,"This Swedish film is one of the best thrillers I've seen in a long time. Based on a best seller novel by Stieg Larsson I haven't read (the first in a trilogy), it starts with Mikael, a middle aged investigative journalist being asked by the old patriarch of a powerful business clan to solve the disappearance of his beloved 16 year old nephew forty years ago. Since this happened during a family reunion at an isolated island, the patriarch believes that she was murdered, and that only a member of the family could have done so. Mikael is soon joined in the investigation by Lisbeth Salander, a troubled but brilliant twenty something female hacker, and soon they are lifting the veil on the very dark secrets behind this prestigious family. Gripping throughout, the film benefits from a number of terrific performances, especially Noomi Rapace playing Lisbeth Salander and Sven Bertil Taube as the patriarch of the clan. While the film is more than two hours long, it is never boring, and all the loose ends are tied brilliantly at the end.",2010
8,"My low regards for Swedish film industry aside, this is a really well crafted movie. Director Oplev apparently knows the ropes enough to make the Swedish crew seem plausible. The old school with SB Taube and Hirdwall usually deliver good characters, and Nyqvist as well. The younger talent strikes me as a bit more stiff usually and deliver dialogs as they read directly from the script. Not here. The only one that I find off, is actually Lena Endre. Not that she is bad, but she is just as we always see her. Music-wise, a big step in the right direction. I think of Howard Shore scores from Seven and Silence of the lambs. Too bad that the movie sound, the dialog in particular, doesn't hold the same standard. Also, not to give anything away, in the final scenes- bear in mind Bourne Ultimatum last scenes, and Silence of the lambs final. In short, hats of to this magnificent film. This is the proof that you don't necessarily make a good flick just on million dollar budgets as in Arn(lame), but with the right talent. In this case I salute director Oplev.",2009
10,I had no idea what to expect with this movie but after seeing something on MSN.com about people screwed over by the globes I figured Id give it a whirl.,2011
10,"I rarely include spoilers in my reviews. The only reason I will in this one is for the benefit of Noomi Rapace and other members of the cast and crew who made this movie perfect. Hollywood does the weirdest things. Rather than give a new writer a chance, they'll remake an absolutely perfect recent film. Bizarre. I truly hope it backfires on them. Seeing the trailers for the remake, I'm baffled. It's flat. There is nothing in their eyes. Noomi Rapace is gripping in this film. She's my hero. This film contains the most brutal rape scene imaginable, and I nearly had to stop watching, but I could not stop watching *her* - there was something about *her* that promised me that this was not gratuitous sadism. I cheered my guts out when she cleverly trapped the human predator and exacted justice. I had not read the book, so I had no idea this was coming. Noomi's performance is beyond 10. I can't think of another actress who has gone this deep in drama, and I want her to know, it was a very satisfying movie to watch - not mere entertainment - it was cathartic. Thank you.",2011
8,"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, or as it is originally titled Men Who Hate Women, is one of the best contemporary thrillers I have seen in a while. It combines a suspenseful plot and brutal violence with a deep exploration of its title character. It goes beyond its plot, revolving around a missing persons investigation, to become an at times disturbing character study.",2010
9,"It is a quite uncommon event, that a Swedish film should get so much attention pretty much anywhere, not just in Scandinavia or, outside its home regions, the art-house circuit (Bergman isn't exactly multiplex stuff). Of course, when the film in question is based on a best-selling novel, nay, the most profitable book in Northern Europe, it's a whole different thing: partly because of the unique circumstances surrounding its inception (the author was a journalist who wrote fiction just for fun and died shortly after submitting the final version of the manuscripts), Stieg Larsson's Millennium trilogy has shocked and enthralled readers all over the world, which explains why the adaptation of the first chapter, Men Who Hate Women (retitled The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo in English-speaking countries), has become the most successful Swedish movie of all time. That, and the fact that it's a very good film.",2010
8,"This is a grim and gritty tale lightened somewhat by an upbeat ending. Its origins as the first novel in the millennium series by Stieg Larrson is evident in a somewhat meandering storyline and a running time of two and a half hours, with the inevitable excisions from the book. Nevertheless the film stands up well on its own.",2010

Mikael is invited to travel to Hedeby Island near Hedestadt to meet Henrik at his home and the old man proposes him to investigate who murdered his beloved nephew Harriet that disappeared forty years ago. Mikael moves to Hedeby Island and Henrik delivers all the files of the case. The journalist learns that all the members of the dysfunctional Vanger family are suspect and the three brothers of Henrik were Nazis. Meanwhile Lisbeth is hacking Mikael's computer and she decides to help him with further information about the case. Henrik hires Lisbeth to help Mikael and they discover a series of hideous murders connected to the disappearance of Harriet. ",2010

A Brilliant master piece should not to be missed in any case.",2010

8,"A true-blooded crime thriller with a good dark atmosphere and very strong story, which certainly is not something unseen in the world of detective fiction, but it comes as a refreshment given to contemporary film offer. Wealthy tycoon Henrik Vanger hires controversial journalist, Mikael Blomkvist, to investigate disappearance of his niece, which happened 40 years ago on the island wholly owned by Vanger family. Blomkvist was sentenced to three months in prison for planted libel against corrupt entrepreneur so Vanger decides to investigate him before hiring. Lisabeth Salander gets the job of investigating Blomkvist but she continues to monitor his computer after the job was done. So, after she sees his new job for Vanger she starts helping him, firstly indirectly and soon directly. Their investigation leads to revelations of dark secrets Vanger family. Although plot is relatively simple, characterization of main characters is thorough which is not strange since this movie is just first in trilogy. In simple words, movie is very good, without both positively and negatively extremes. Perhaps some viewers will not like politicking, and the story certainly could pass without the Nazis, but all in all screenplay seems solid. Acting is at a high level, and there are no big objections on directing. Noomi Rapace that embodies Lisbeth is fantastic, but the rest of the cast is not far away. Perhaps the most remarkable is the atmosphere, which is a typical Scandinavian strong, cold and dark and it suits to story perfectly. The very end is a typical Hollywood and serious viewers will probably feel bitterness because the story had great potential to go in a more interesting and original way.",2013

10,"I've always been cautious about seeing Swedish films made in the last 30-40 years. The reason is that--unlike America, Britain, Germany, China, Mexico, Italy or Australia--there is almost no controversy over who is Sweden's greatest filmmaker. And thus nearly every Swedish film I've ever seen not directed by Ingmar Bergman has either been a rip-off of the great man's work or just shallow trash. (Substitute ""Kurosawa"" for ""Bergman"" and you'll know why I also tend to avoid Japanese cinema). Nonetheless, I kept hearing about this film and the book that inspired it. As a lover of mystery novels and film noir, I decided that I need to at least give this movie a chance. And I'm glad I did. ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" owes almost nothing to Bergman and everything to the novels of Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett and Ross McDonald.",2010
7,"As we've seen many movies like this before: Big, 13 Going on 30, and Freaky Friday, we always love to see the retelling of the old classic story of the switching age. Since the story has been used so much, a director can only do so much to just do the best they can with, Burr Steers pulls 17 Again out with great laughs and good fun. I'm going to get this out, I am one of the rare girls that just doesn't get the whole Zac Efron heart throb thing, I agree that he's cute, but with mainly High School Musical only being his claim to fame other than Hairspray, he is adorable, but can he act? Surprisingly he can. I can't believe I'm saying this, he was actually a good strong lead role and a perfect fit, he has charisma, he's funny, charming and makes this story worth your time and money.",2009
7,"I went to see this with film with my teenage daughter and really wasn't expecting to enjoy it. I settled down in my seat for the duration and the first few scenes showing Efron as a high school basketball player had me groaning inwardly as I assumed that this was going to be another predictable high school/age swap film of the type that has been done so many times before - and really isn't the sort of film I would choose to see anyway. Not a promising start. However, I was pleasantly surprised by 17 Again. It was witty and well acted and made me laugh out loud - not something I often do even when I appreciate the humour in a film.",2009
7,"I'm not a big fan of Zac Efron but this film was actually good. Its was entertaining it was sweet and it was very funny. It's a little confusing figuring out who was who when he went back to being 17 again. There are a few funny parts and a few sad parts. I caught myself rolling my eyes at the silly high school girls, they are quite pathetic. The story was entertaining and original, along with the characters ( except the high school girl) But however i felt a feeling of Deja Vu , yes i'm talking about 13 going to 30 it wasn't the same type of story but the concept is the same. I would have liked to see more of Matthew Perry though. But frankly i wasn't expecting that much. I was pleasantly surprised and would definitively recommend this very funny movie. It's entertaining and worth watching.",2009
10,"I've just returned from the cinema after watching this film and I have to say, my friends and I laughed like a bunch of hyenas (probably to the annoyance of anyone behind us) all the way through it. The story of course is nothing original, but you knew that going in, and yes, there are some seemingly ridiculous or stereotypical character setups, again acknowledged beforehand, but the direction and the acting, more than makes up for this. Most of the actors, especially Efron, who proves he's definitely not just a wanna-be pretty boy and actually stores away some talent, play their parts well. Matthew Perry seemed slightly misplaced, even if he was the reason I went to see the film in the first place. Not to mention the director being Burr Steers who directed one of my favourite films. I could kind of tell how in the wrong hands this movie could have been embarrassingly bad, but Steers manages to balance the right amount of comedy with drama and turn it into something really worth seeing. Efron blew me away. I have to say, I didn't see it coming, and I never thought I'd say such a sentence, but this boy can do better than TV Disney movies. I'm kind of glad he has turned down re-make, Footloose, not only because it's a 're-make of footloose'.",2009

7,"Every teen generation needs a good body swap/turn the clock back type of story and 17 again is one of those stories, Mike O'Donnell had it all. He was the star of his high schools basket ball team. He had Scarlet the most beautiful girl in the school as his girlfriend. Right before the game that could make him into a star, Scarlet tells Mike she's pregnant, Mike makes a drastic and life altering decision and runs out of the game to be with her giving up his chances of becoming a basket ball star, now 20 years later Mike's regretting it all and wishes he could do it all over again, and by some miraculous way he does.",2009

However, his girlfriend Scarlett (Allison Miller) tells him that she is pregnant and Mike does not play the game. Twenty years later, Mike (Matthew Perry) is a complete loser that blames Scar for his failures: he is not promoted to sale manager after working sixteen years in the same company; Scarlett (Leslie Mann) is divorcing him; his teenagers son Alex (Sterling Knight) and daughter Maggie (Michelle Trachtenberg) hate him; and he is temporarily living with his best friend, the eccentric and immature millionaire Ned Gold (Thomas Lennon). Mike nostalgically visits Hayden where an old janitor talks to him about second chance in life. During the night, he sees the janitor jumping from a bridge into the river and he unsuccessfully tries to help the man. Mike passes out and when he wakes up, he discovers that he is seventeen again. Further, he discovers that he has a second chance to fix his relationship with his family.",2010
8,"So I saw an advanced screening. I didn't expect much, but it was actually pretty good! It might be a plot line that has been seen a lot, but this one is actually entertaining. People have compared it to ""13 going to 30"" but trust me, this one is much better. It has comedy and drama, my sister teared up in one part. Thomas Lennon is pretty funny, Leslie Man always the scene stealer and of course Zac Efron. HE CAN ACT. If you didn't think he was hot before wait until you watch the movie and acts like a real person, not a goody goody fake teenager from ""High School Musical"" though he was the best performer in that movie (I'm not hating on High School Musical I found it entertaining.) I recommend ""17 Again"" for adults and mature children.",2009
4,"CHUGA CHUGA CHUGA - The Hollywood movie machine cranks out another gem, haven't I seen this same script about 34 times? I'll start with this, why does no one recognize the 17 yr old version of Mike, not his daughter or son, best friend from HS or ex coach? Zac is a good looking guy with a memorable face, seriously, hasn't everyone seen pictures of their parents when they were teens? Wouldn't you recognize them? And his wife of 20 years does not hear a difference in his voice on the phone even though we all do? Then he introduces himself to his own son as the son of his uncle, this must not be a very close family.",2009
7,"This is another movie I watched with my friend who works at a movie theatre. With elements of Big and 13 Going on 30, not to mention It's a Wonderful Life and Back to the Future, 17 Again is a pretty enjoyable meshing of those movies considering the cast which has Zac Efron, Michelle Trachtenberg, Leslie Mann, Margaret Cho, Thomas Lennon, and Melora Hardin. I also recognized Matthew Perry and Nicole Sullivan. I did not realize until the cast credits that the bearded janitor at the high school was Brian Doyle-Murray, Bill's brother. Now, parts of the plot and characterizations were a little uneven but despite that there were plenty of scenes that were hilarious especially those between Lennon and Hardin. With them, I also saw a little ""Big Bang Theory"" vibe. Oh, and there's a little touching pro-abstinence speech here as well (though it still is acknowledged that not all teens will feel that way). All in all, despite some adult humor, 17 Again was an enjoyable comedy that should be enjoyable enough for parents and offspring alike. Oh, and one more thing: I thought the Vanilla Ice reference in the 1989 sequence didn't fit since I remember him not even emerging until the following year...",2009
9,"I went into this a little dubious, unable to get tickets for anything else but set on seeing something - I walked out glad nothing was available! First off, the casting is brilliant with the teenage and adult versions of each of the main 3 characters. Secondly, it proves that Zac Efron really can act, not just sing, dance and play basketball (although they do flaunt the latter two talents of these within the first 10 minutes). Finally, it's original. Although reminding me, and probably everyone who's reading this, of films like Freaky Friday, 13 Going On 30, Big, etc, just being the opposite way in age, it really makes good use of the comedy this situation brings, but doesn't rely on it or overplay on it.",2009
4,"Complete with a cast of notable faces and a stellar soundtrack featuring The Virgins, Santogold, and The Kooks, my initial trepidation was pushed aside as I decided to go into this ""spiritual journey"" mish-mash with an open mind. I'm glad I did, because there are some genuinely funny moments along with a sweet and touching overall message. However, when you look deep into the work you will not find much to grasp onto below the surface. It's been seen before; the relationship between young-again father and his high school children gets beyond creepy; and everything happens just as you'd assume it would. There are no surprises, but did you really think there would be? The film is all about Mike O'Donnell, a soon to be 40 year old who has been looking back on his life with regret. As the star basketball player in high school, he chose love and family above a chance to play in, or even go to, college. The past twenty years have been a chore of responsibility he never could own up to despite his beautiful wife and two children. When divorce proceedings commence and he sees once and for all how little his kids see him as a father figure, he comes in contact with Brian Doyle-Murray's janitor who sends him back, in body not time, to rediscover why he made the choice he did. What is initially looked upon as a chance to be the hero on the court again becomes an opportunity to help his kids against the angst and horrors of high school—becoming a hero in his home life, the path he chose back when he was actually seventeen.",2009
8,"""17 Again"" has been done before in ""Big"", ""13 Going On 30"" and one of my favorite movies, ""The Kid"". That being said: I really liked ""17 Again"". This is a star vehicle for teen heart-throb Zac Efron. Okay, the movie opens cheesy with ripped Efron shooting baskets in 1989 as high school star point guard Mike O'Donnell, highly recruited by colleges. Efron also impresses in a dance number with the cheerleaders. It's a good kind of cheese.",2009
1,I hammered Taking of Pelham 123 too harshly and now regret it. I shall try to shirk the criticism away slowly and appreciate the finer aspects of any movie. Any movie will do at this time except 17 again. Do I begin with the pansy looking Efron who probably looked natural prettily dancing with the cheerleaders than he did as the lead actor. I am really suspicious of girls who dig Efron. Anyway that makes up for an entirely different discussion and I shall not stray any further until I am done butchering and battering this movie to bits. Did I promise not to be too harsh again? Well I will try. ,2009

It may possess a somewhat predictable storyline that we have seen a couple of times before, but if you are looking for a lighthearted film to keep you entertained throughout, this will do the job. Zac Efron shows us he is more than the ""all-singing-all-dancing"" charmer from High School Musical, he nails this performance. His character is believable throughout showing audiences he is a true actor, not a franchise and will hopefully lose some of the stigma he attracted in the role of Troy Bolton. Co-stars also but in a good performance including Matthew Perry although not getting much air time still played a valid role in the film as an entirety. Great watch for all the family, I definitely recommend this one!",2009

Normally I find my self entertained by these youngster-become-mature-over-night (Big, etc.) or any of the several grownup-becomes-young-again variations - but this is simply too stupid. The protagonist is afforded an IQ less than the square root of his age. I am not badmouthing the actors, who did a fine job with the absurdly limited resources given - and by that I mean the horrible, horrible script. Seriously, Hollywood - shape up or ship out.",2009
6,"I was invited to this movie by my Dad's girlfriend and since I wanted to be supportive, I came and hey...free movie. So as expected, me and my Dad were maybe 2 of 8 guys in a sea of teenage girls which was kind of embarrassing/hilarious. Anyway, 17 Again is mediocrity in its most boiled down form. The movie is about how Chandler Bing decides he hates his life now and is magically transformed into Zac Efron by Brian Doyle Murray as a corpulent janitor. Now mind you he doesn't go back in time...he's just 17 again in the same time. So he ends up going back to school and learning very important lessons regarding his family. Costarring Leslie Mann (who I love) as Chandler Bing's wife and Michelle Trachtenberg (who has a rockin' heinie), 17 Again features a couple good laughs, a predictable plot, and one particularly emotionally charged, well acted scene from Zac Efron. Basically, this movie could've been a lot better.",2009
1,"It's beyond me how people consider this to be a good movie. Zac Efron cannot, by any means, act decently. In addition, he really isn't funny and the whole ""pretty-boy"" attitude is just irritating. There was really no moral to it and it just wasn't entertaining at all. The character that plays the geeky friend isn't cute or funny; in fact, I really want to punch him in the face repeatedly. Granted, I assumed that it would be a cute movie for little kids. ",2009
1,"OK, I really turned up to this film to think it'd be really good. The hottest guy was the main role!!! I'm 16, looked like my sort of film, but I was totally wrong. Me and 3 others of my friends went to see this (thank god we used orange Wednesdays) and we were cringing the whole way through.",2009
2,"They could have tried a bit more the movie was so horrible. I watched all, with the silly hope that it will become better at some point, yet my hope was in vain. If you like the main character, then this movie is good for you, if you don't then do not go to this movie. The story is lame and seen at least a billion of times. The characters are even worse (if its possible). I could say that it is one of the worse movies that I have seen in this year, but that would be too much. I could thou say that everything rides on the main character fame (sorry I could not spell out his name) and everything else is left out. I will give them 2 for trying. The good part that acting was not that bad, but the script...",2009
1,"I only wanted to see this movie because Matthew Perry is in it. But he is almost not in it at all. They should have given half the movie to Matthew and the rest to that annoying pretty boy Zac Efron. But Mathhew is only in the movie for a very short time. And though he is a little funny, he is completely wasted in this teenage-crap. They must have offered him a lot of money to do this. This should have been a Matthew Perry movie with Zac Efron, not the other way around.",2010
4,"A movie worth seeing, not because it was good, but actually because it was so awful. Mostly, it was a clichéd mess that threw together barely disguised parts of movies such as The Family Man, It's A Wonderful Life, Big...and somewhere in the middle of that, a Star Wars type battle scene involving actual light sabers. The acting was mediocre at times and decent at others. Predictable, the only saving graces were the decent pacing and the occasional comedic moment. The best parts of the movie were the comedic blunders of Mike (Zac Efron)'s adult in a teenage body self as he tried to befriend his children, now fellow high school students, and consistently behaved like a 40 year old man/dad instead of their peer. I would never see it again, but it was bizarre enough to make seeing it once, when you have nothing better to do, worthwhile.",2009
7,When I went and saw 17 Again and the film opened with Zac Efron in a basketball uniform shooting baskets for a minute I thought I was at High School Musical 4. But in fact it was not a bad comedy/drama in which Efron and Matthew Perry play the same character at different points of their lives.,2009

8,"An eerie yet gorgeous tapestry of lingering close-ups; parallels, cuts and slow-motion photography, Lars Von Trier's Antichrist is a gruelling tale of mythical grandeur: a bizarre yet beautiful film chock full of sadism and shagging, Satanic dogma and similes. Most of which, I don't understand. So you'll be pleased to know that I have no intention of harping on about the director's bent meditation on gender, nature, genocide, motherhood, misogyny and astronomy. I find all that stuff interesting, don't get me wrong, but when things get Freudian I'm way out of my league. Therefore, I'll stick to what I know.",2009

1,"Beautiful cinematography, and I don't have a problem with explicit sex if it serves a purpose but quite frankly I found this film to be ridiculous with no redeeming value. In fact, it represents ~2 hours of my life I will never get back. Where do I begin? I watched the film on DVD so I had the benefit of extra features. I watched them all including the director commentary because I was sure I'd missed something. However, it did not reveal WTF the point of events like - the only ""oddity"" that the autopsy reveals is that Nic has a deformity of his feet. But so what? We find Nic was being forced to wear his shoes on the wrong feet - did that cause his fall? Did that constitute senseless torture by his mother because she was an ""evil woman?"" Who knows, the commentary revealed nothing. Nor did it reveal the symbolism behind the masses of women descending the mountain at the ending. I imagine they were the corpses of all the ""evil"" women?"" How did all these evil corpses get there? What was the significance of Eden? How did it become the epicenter and burial ground of evil women??? What about all the sex scenes? The finale suggests that her thesis was disproved by Eden where the forces of nature revealed that women are the truly evil, manipulative, and conniving of the sexes. So, why the constant violent insistence that her husband puck her, at every inopportune moment, when he is trying to help her, she is constantly grabbing at his zipper, his dick, its all rather desperate and nonsensical... The scenes went from evocative to boring. I'm bored, where is this plot going? What plot? I'm not impressed - although Defoe's pubic hair is rather impressive (but I digress). After all that, she mutilates herself? Why? Is her cli-toris the source of evil and by mutilating herself she is being set free? We will never know because she immediately gets strangled and burned Salem-Witch-style. Oh, and I almost forgot the most hokey element - the three beggars - Bahaha! The fox, the doe and the crow. She says when they appear someone must die, they appear - she dies. The end, right? NO! They again appear to Hubby as he is limping out of Eden. It is absolutely comical. Then all the dead ladies in skirts start descending the mountain... seriously, its as ridiculous as it sounds.",2012
1,"What it takes to make an 'Art' movie???.........Nothing, just show whatever you hate the most and you cant understand unless you are Einstein or a psycho!!

I can show people smearing human feces all over their body and then laughing out of proportion and then cut....... and next scene of a decaying pig head with maggots coming out of it's mouth ....and millions of shots like that.....Is this art?? Well, for those praising this movie (I doubt how much they actually understand art) this could be an art, but for me, this is disgusting imagination of a psychopath, who needs mental treatment as early as possible. Get real, get courage to say that the king is nude. If someone makes a movie in the name of art, doesn't mean you need to praise it even if you don't understand that. For those who haven't seen this movie, I warn them not to watch. They will be regretting for losing 100 mins of their precious life.",2010
1,I feel it my civic duty to warn you - your IQ sustain heavy casualties as a result of watching this movie through to its gruesome conclusion. To be fair the most redeeming quality of this movie was the end and in reality I found the movie offensive to watch - the director seemed to have a message buried deep down but might almost certainly lost it ad mists the tirade of unnecessary gore. I can honestly tell you that watching this movie is a mistake. It was disjointed and the scenes were misplaced and reminded me a lot of the Parody that Willem Dafoe did at the end of one of the Mr Bean movies - and even that parody looked like it might have been a better movie than this was. What Rubbish.,2012
1,"It is with some regret that I have decided to spend time reviewing Von Trier's 'Antichrist'.

9,"First I have to make a comment to cynibun from United States who wrote ""And if you look at the previous reviewers they are from Denmark, where the director is from. Perhaps you have to be Danish to appreciate the horrific torture pornography, who knows??... Americans have more sense thankfully, and do not call everything art simply because the director is foreign."" I have no idea why it should matter where the other reviewers are from. That has nothing to do with ""Antichrist"" as a film. Some like it and some don't, no matter what country they are from. If I don't like an American film I don't go out and bash on reviewers from America and then state that Danes have more sense - what's that all about? Sense of what? Personally I don't think it makes much sense making movies like ""American Pie"" or ""Hannah Montana"", but hey, they produce the films anyway - maybe because they have more sense. Hannah Montana makes a LOT of sense... And you don't have to come from Denmark to like ""Antichrist"" (though it is a very constructive statement), I'm guessing there is one or two people from Russia or Poland who likes the film also...",2009

2,"Films invariably provoke emotions on the part of the viewer. I have been shocked, awed, amused, saddened and comforted by a feature length before but never have I been so annoyed. For the hour and 40 I was sat in my seat I was bombarded by a free-fall of blatant and obvious metaphors sandwiched between edited clips of the selfish tripe that was flowing from His and Her ""grief-addled"" minds.",2009
9,"Within a complex tapestry of theology and symbolism Lars Von Trier's Antichrist plums the depths of the human condition taking cinema to places it has never gone nor ever wanted to go before. Following the establishing tragic accident (their son falls out of a window while they make love) He and She journey out to Eden, a remote lodge in the woods, for therapy where their lives and souls are changed forever. Far from a traditional horror film LVT gives us the darkest of psychological works that starts with shock before travelling down the spiral through grief, despair and panic ending in travesty. Gainsbourg and Defoe take us there, they carry the film on their monumental performances - Gainsbourg gives everything physically and emotionally to her role, while Defoe's character's grip on intellectualism is unrelenting. With death and depression permeating every frame of the film it has to be said that much of what is seen is stunningly beautiful - i really cant overstate the quality of the cinematography; at the same time the hauntingly evocative sound design adds that much needed 3rd dimension of pure evil that finishes off the work perfectly. It says and shows many disgusting things about humanity, but does so with such purity of vision, such artistic conviction that i found it totally irresistible. Not a film i'd want to see again in a hurry but certainly one i'm thankful i've experienced - it pushes the envelope in hitherto unforeseen ways that will probably affect film as a medium for years to come. If nothing else, i hope it helped LVT's recovery.",2010

10,"Antichrist is an excellent and not often seen chance to see a magnificent piece of art. The director Lars Von Trier has always attempted to go beyond the limits of what could be shown in a movie without compromising his artistic vision. And in antichrist he succeeds. A sometimes hard and gruelling movie to watch - I am at this point, a mere 1½ hour after exciting the movie theater, still deeply affected by the fantastic imagery and the cruel nauseating violence and self molestation. This is definitely a must see movie - if not for anything else, then at least for the splendid acting performances and the absolutely genius photographing. Von Trier has succeeded in creating a movie that is going to shock and must likely offend - but also assure movie buffs like myself - that there are still movie directors about that knows how to create masterpieces in a time where mainstream seems to be all there is.",2009
8,"Lars Von Trier is a director who's always been going his own ways, and this can definitely be seen in this movie. Antichrist is a movie that doesn't hold anything back when it comes to gore, and the stuff that you see in the film won't leave your mind the next couple of days. But the movie itself is much more than that... The movie is beautifully shot, the story and setting extremely uncomfortable and the acting is fantastic. The movie is sometime painful to watch, not in a ""Saw"" or ""Hostel"" kind of way, but when you leave the theater you feel genuinely uncomfortable, and that is one of the reasons why i liked this movie. It's a movie like nothing i've experienced and I'm glad that we have directors like Lars Von Trier that dares to make a film like this. It's nothing like the mainstream movies that are being made nowadays, and it makes your mind race when you leave the theater, something very few movies does. You aren't served with facts, as with any other movies, but are left to interpret and think for yourself. It's a bizarre movie and not one for the faint of heart, but if you dare to be provoked and see a movie like nothing you've ever seen, then go see Antichrist.",2009

He, who is a therapist, disregards her doctor and the medication given to her.

He attempts to treat her himself with a number of psychological exercises, but there is something terribly ominous brewing inside Eden.",2009

4,"Come on, why is everybody raving about this movie... the opening scene and some of the mysterious shots in the movie look nice but everything here was done before, even in cheap perfume adverts. The movie is so damn boring and the final scenes are so pseudo provocative I get why people walked out of the movie. When everyone is writing how shocking this movie is (and that just refers to 2 scenes I guess... funny how anything mixing sex and violence still shocks people... ) and you are served such a pretentious snooze fest no wonder people walk out before they fall asleep. You can interpret the movie in many ways, thats fine... BUT just dropping in religious and psychological references doesn't make a movie smart. I think the way that many react to criticism of this movie shows a lot of self-righteousness and snobby mentality of many Von trier fans. Whatever Mr. Trier was trying to say with this movie... I think he did it in a most unentertaining way. And after all you go to the movie to be entertained in whatever way but here you get endless artsy shots, no resolution whatsoever, characters I couldn't care less about (it was some kind of relief to see him strangle her to be honest), random sex scenes at times artsy at time dirty... what the hell? If you like interpreting the mix of genital mutilation, talking animals and mysterious shots of moving leaves... have a go, but don't tell people who find movies like this annoying that they are not smart enough.

8,"""Drop Dead Diva"" is a new series on Lifetime. The pilot is very enjoyable, mainly because of the star, Brooke Elliot, who is fabulous.

One night, she stays late at the office, and a man, angry with one of the partners, comes in with a gun. She is killed. At the same moment of her death, a shallow, pencil thin, blonde beauty named Deb is driving to an audition to be a prize demonstrator on The Price is Right and crashes while putting on lipstick.

9,"What a FUN show. The plot is familiar but well worked. Brooke Elliot is delightful to watch! She captures the flirty sorority girl trapped in a plus sized body with panache. The rest of the cast is delivers interesting performances and I really want to get to know them all. It will be interesting to watch the development of her guardian angel as he figures out life on earth. The court cases are interesting to observer. I usually avoid Lifetime and its sentimental disease of the week programming, but I am seeking this show out. I hope that they will be able to sustain their great start. I am not sure if it is being picked for more episodes, but I hope this show has a long run!",2009
7,"I caught the pilot of this show today without very high expectations, but it was actually really great and really amusing, with a fun soundtrack and interesting setting. Brooke Elliott is great as Deb in Jayne's body, the switch she portrayed between the characters was subtle but apparent, and she is very likable. The supporting cast are also all very strong. The writers do well in drawing the audience in, I already care about these characters after one 40 minute episode. Having told myself I am going to watch much less TV, and dropping about 50% of the shows I used to watch regularly, the fact that I plan to continue watching Drop Dead Diva shows how entertaining the pilot was. I'm looking forward to seeing more of what this show has to offer, and I hope it continues to deliver and develop into a great series.",2009
4,"They took a good show and murdered it. I was particularly disappointed that Jane did not do the singing in the last show!!!!! The story line became so stupid it was beyond fantasy. It should have ended with the wedding and if they wanted it to end with the babies, how about showing some newborns and the cast gathered around the mom. If that put too much focus on Stacy, then have Jane hold one kid and say the things they said going into her house. They could talk about their own kids while holding the new baby. I was all a big mes. At least they found someone for Kim at the end. I kept thinking of the show when it started. It was really good. I enjoyed the singing when Jane would sing like a regular person not in a dream. Why did they stop her from singing? The first three seasons were the best.",2014
10,"Like Tom Hanks, Brooke Elliott has ""that certain something"", that very few actors have. It has to do with Likability. She exudes a very pleasant charm. She makes it easy to believe that a sweet, model-aspiring airhead has inhabited a high power attorney and has access to her rapid-firing brain cells. I like it that the Jane Bingum character has a golden moral compass and yet is playful like a Sex in the City girl. Kudos to the creator and writers for creating a character that is like a real person. The Jane Bingum character reveals great sensitivity and vulnerability along with areas of great strength and fortitude. This is no ""one note"" character like the many that usually populate series TV shows. Drop Dead Diva is both high drama and wry comedy by virtue of its excellent writers. But, where would this show be without Brooke Elliott? It will be interesting to see what she does next. I predict a smart producer or director will cast her in a movie on the big screen very soon.",2009
7,"I simply love this new TV show and wish it would last for more than just a season or two like some other great shows I loved and that were off. Anyway, let's talk about Drop Dead Diva. Actually, my first reaction to the show, or frankly to the TITLE of the show, was kind of ""What a nonsense they're putting on"". Hello!? I could not have been wrong more here. Not a nonsense. Quite on the contrary. One can not only get a nice law story per episode, but also gets a share of really great performance here as well as really lovable characters. I loved and love a lot of TV shows (most of them already ended), but since my late teens I for the first time am really thrilled with the main character of the TV show, as well as I can well put myself in almost every position she's in (except, huh, for having your soul trapped in a wrong body). It's like in many TV shows and movies we only get these 'super white big smile nice body' actors and actresses which all look great and at the same time almost the same and just as unreal as Santa to any grown-up, but this time we are getting this new character which is awesome, beautiful, and at the same time just like me, you or someone next to you.

7,"I rarely watch Lifetime because their programs, in my opinion, always seem like the same, lame, made-for-women schmaltz. But I have to state that ""Drop Dead Diva"" was so very good! We've seen many movies with this plot: two people die at the same time but one person's soul enters the other's body and has to live that life. Brooke Elliott is delightful as the plump woman who winds up with a thin, empty-headed, self-absorbed woman's soul. I love the way she discovers her new self after a tragic accident and is quite convincing. Elliott is so cute as she enters this new world as a thin soul in a plump body. Her laugh is contagious. Her pain is convincing when in a moment of clarity she finds out how other people suffer. The producers of this show so far have not made it too preachy (don't judge people by their appearance), or too lightweight (they don't spend too much time on the thin woman's life). If this program continues to focus on ""Jane"" in the here and now without lots of flashbacks on the other woman...they have a hit on their hands. I love the thin friend too. She's adjusted and accepted her friend in a new form.",2009

The premise is Freaky Friday meets LA Law, but add in a guardian angel, smart chicks, models, and fresh story lines.. and hey, you've got my attention.

5,"They need to bring back Jay Parker, hands down, and cut the ""original Jane"" character, and stop making Stacey make so insanely stupid decisions and being extremely dramatic, like suddenly going on needlessly urgent search for sperm donors to have a baby, sacrificing her relationship with Jane just to briefly hook up with Owen, then for no reason at all making a big deal and breaking up with Owen. It makes me sick to my stomach. Owen's character used to be so in love with Jane, for him to suddenly pick up Stacey and act all natural make it seem unbelievable and audience lose respect of him. You can tell the actor playing Owen (a very good actor) even has a hard time trying to make it seem justifiable! Any self-respecting actor will feel the writing is crap. What a waste of a good cast! If they are doing a sixth season and want to retain followers and attract new viewers, they NEED to do the following: 1) Their most urgent need right now is to bring Parker back and keep Kim around! These two are immensely appealing and drawing actors and characters. They bring depth and charisma to the show. 2) Secondly, make Stacey herself not a crazy friend betraying, sperm-crazy, lunatic mom! 3) last but not least, bring Jane and Grayson together already. It's painful and annoying to watch another episode where the show tries desperately to drag on the suspicion with irrational plots of surprises coming up last minute or interruptions during their confessions. It's not interesting anymore nor suspense. Just plain disturbance and people are losing interest fast. They need to move the show onto new grounds and stop spoiling a fresh idea by lazily adopting old tricks to fool the audience. These writers and producers need to get real and make a honest living, or most viewers will not return. If they follow these suggestions, I think they will find the show more successful. If they don't heed advice from the very people the show's trying to draw, they aren't very smart.",2013

10,"Slightly Addictive! I have enjoyed the show's Second season while a short stay in the U.S, so now that Netflix is available in South America I have been watching back to back episodes of the show and I'm enjoying each episode thoroughly. I am so Glad to find the show is still on! and I can not wait to follow it closely. Brooke Elliott is impeccable as Jane/Deb. Funny, light hearted, with a pinch of sarcasm. She's amazing in it! She sure shows to anyone who can see that even if she doesn't wear the fashion forward standard size, she is an incredible woman, with a great personality, a successful career and let me be honest here she is also BEAUTIFUL!. and Fred ? Love him, he's the kind of guy that makes you say things like 'he's my brother from another mother'and seriously, who could have played Teri as good as Margaret Cho does? NO ONE!. Honestly they have done a great job finding the perfect cast, and so far I love all the characters, I even like Kate Levering as the bigheaded Kim (which by the way is really well played!). The writing is light and delightful, specially for this being set at a law firm. I am not a lawyer, and I am not American, so the legal portion is also helpful to learn how things work there. Although I can not tell when it is all fairplayed or not. But for what is worht it I'm tired of shows that starts as comedy and end up being drama, drama, DRAMA! Watching the show is the perfect way to end a long day of work. After all we have enough DRAMA living our own lives.",2012
7,"I came late to the party on this series, mostly because I'm not much of a cable watcher or a Lifetime fan. In this world with 100-plus channels to fill with some percentage of original content, there are many many series which I will never see and never even hear of.",2012
10,"I have been a long time anime fan, but somehow this little gem of a show managed to upstage everything to quickly become my favorite. It has it all, great characters, roll on the floor humor, and a fantastic production level. It starts out a tad bit slowly as each of the main characters are introduced, but once it gets going it really takes off.",2011
10,"Fairy Tail is the Greatest show I have Ever seen Ever! It is SOOOOOO Excellent! Words cant describe it! It has Everything! There is something in this show for Everybody! Humor, Action, Drama, Romance, Magic, Shocking Twists, Great Animation, Beautiful Music, and Much Much more! This show has changed my life and I absolutely adore it! It makes me cry every other episode! Thats how touching it is! I admire that no matter what odds they are up against, the characters of Fairy Tail never give up on their friends ever! And that level of dedication to each other is just Plain Amazing! The fight scenes are Always Spectacularly Epic! The characters are all so Freakin Awesome and Intensely Lovable! There is not one character I dislike in this show, I just find myself loving everybody! I highly recommend that everybody on this planet watch Fairy Tail! You Will not regret it!",2012
7,"In a world where magic is commonly used and sold, a team of guild members takes on various missions to earn enough money to pay the rent. Among them are Lucy, a celestial spirit mage, Natsu, a fire dragon slayer, and Happy, a blue winged cat.",2011
7,"I am a watcher of many animes, and the way I can tell how good or entertaining a series is is how it captures me in the first few episodes. Fairy Tail manages to do exactly that. Sure there are going to be a few weak points and continuity within the story, but there are plenty of strong points too. A good and bad note for the series is how there are so many characters within; it can be good because some characters you'll connect with better then others, but that is also a bad thing since it divides much needed attention to what is relevant at the moment, however Hiro Mashima handles it quite well. The score, done by Yasuharu Takanashi, does well in delivery the tones from intense to sad to flat out silly (and in many ways, saves the show in its weak moments).",2012
8,Quick review:,2013
2,"Fairy Tail is definitely one of the most popular shounen anime and if  you are thinking of watching it based on this fact alone then I  encourage you to read some reviews first.  What can be said about the story? Nothing really special, a girl named  Lucy wants to become a wizard in a famous guild and after she meets  Natsu one of its members she manages to join him and thus they form a  team and start on taking missions and embark on journeys.The story  progresses in arcs with each arc being connected nicely with the next  one and the transition between them feels smooth and logical. The  atmosphere and the nature of each arc generally remain the same  lighthearted and cheerful vibe following the vibe of the anime on its  whole except for some moments and scenes which need to be dark to show  the contradiction between good and evil. Although the story of each  individual arc can be described as cliché you could at least expect the  execution to be masterful for a popular anime like this, right? No they  decided to s**t all over the place with the word mediocrity, there are  some glimpses of good storytelling and directing in some arcs but this  is exactly what they are, glimpses.Individual elements of each arc are  interesting but the story itself is unoriginal although how it's told  and executed is what counts the most and this show had the potential to  be great but they vomited it all out to appeal to the general public  and/or their target group, if this was their purpose than they nailed  it. Linear,repetitive and predictable storytelling and the use of  generic guidelines as in any typical shounen of this type leave no room  for the element of surprise for some rare plot twists that might exist.  Generally the arcs are short and leave no room for good development and  the pace of each arc is out of place. I felt that some arcs needed  faster pace but others slower, go figure. Some episodes are uneventful  with no action and on top of that no story or character development of  any kind. Dialogues are mediocre and superficial for the most part but  there are comedic moments where combined with sound and animation made  me actually laugh hard. The blend of action, comedy and drama is  mediocre and as I already mentioned ""Oh the potential!!!!"".  Fairy Tail's characters is another disappointing fact. We are  introduced to a large cast of characters who are one dimensional and  static. Main characters are flat and underdeveloped. I understand that  combined with short arcs there isn't much room left to develop so many  of them but they could at least try. Every stereotype of this genre can  be found in this series, from the typical hotheaded male protagonist to  the evil villain who becomes good and changes sides and the fact that  most of them remain the same throughout the series makes this show even  more predictable. It's impossible to be caught by surprise when you  expect for them to act based on their generic stereotype and they act  exactly like that in any given situation. The villains of the show are  equally as underdeveloped as the main characters  The last disappointing fact I want to mention is the fighting scenes.  Battle system is your typical ""raw strength+power ups wins"" concept.  Almost no amount of thought or originality can be traced anywhere. Some  abilities are cool but that's it. The battles are won by overpowering  the enemy and no strategical thinking is involved. Superficial and  annoyingly tiring dialogs and monologues which ruin the pace of the  story take place in every fight scene and I mean literally in EVERY  fight scene. I know that concepts like friendship and comradeship are  important don't misunderstand me but not when they are in excess and  feel like they try to nail it in my brain with a drill and on top of  that at the expense of the story. Power levels are confusing.There are  no trainings but main characters manage to win enemies they shouldn't  be able to win like ever. Oh yea I forgot the power of friendship and  nakamas!!! Silly me.  Generally this whole thing can be summed up in 6 steps. Step 1: A  strong enemy appears. MC's are beaten up by the enemy. Step 2: MC's  yell about friendship and the power of nakamas. Step 3: They power up  emotionally and physically by the power of friendship and random stuff.  Step 4: MC's overpower the villain. Step 5: No training of any kind  whatsoever. Step 6: New arc. Go to step 1. When an anime can be summed  up like this than in my books this is not good at all.  Animation is top notch and very consistent, facial expressions are  distinct and well portrayed. As for the sound it's the most positive  thing of this show. It's quite brilliant and fits well to every scene  and arc of this show. Voice actors are for the most part all great.  All in all fairy tail generally has a vibe of positivity and  lightheartedness. If you like characters that seem cool, raw power,  mc's that overpower their enemies who rely on their friends and protect  each other, if you like good animation with awesome soundtracks mixed  perfectly to every scene, if you liked something like D-Gray Man or  Bleach than you should watch this show and I am sure you will enjoy it  very much.I definitely recommend this to children as well. But if you  are an experienced anime viewer or if you like intelligence, good  story,plot and character development if you like insane plot twists and  strategic battle scenes with complex fighting systems or if you want to  watch something of this genre but don't have much time than don't waste  it on this and watch something like Hunter x Hunter or Fullmetal  Alchemist Brotherhood.",2014
10,"Words are too earthly incompetent and humane to describe this amazing,most epic, the most awesome show ever. It's funny, emotional, exhilarating, visually stunning, thrilling, exciting.......it's everything good about this universe. The characters the heroes, the villains, the allies, the people in the background. Everyone in the show are so amazing. Hiro Mashima, you are a GOD. You are more than a mere God. A Genius. I am eternally grateful to you for making this show, for giving meaning to my life. FAIRY TAIL IS THE MANIFESTATION OF MAGIC ITSELF. So pure. Nothing can ever even come close to this. It's the best show, no, not show, but the thing in the world. PERIOD.",2016
10,"Fairy Tail, from first i see the anime ; i got first to love the art, design and music team for Fairy Tail and beyond some episodes i realized i got more love to this anime which sometimes make me cry, happy or boring mixed into one. ",2013
8,"Fairy Tail is one of my favorite long-running shows for many reasons. One, the action is good and well detailed, the comedy is hilarious and used at the right times, and it's eye-opening discussions make you love the characters even more. Every time I watched an episode, I would have many different reactions to them. Sometimes I'll be, 'oh that was good', or 'what the hell did I just watch', or 'that was freaking intense!', or 'that was depressing' and... you get the point. My point is that this series will leave you with many different emotions as you walk away from it. Some may say it is over the top when it comes to the humor or the action, but still, it sticks to the story and it doesn't care if anything is over the top. Some people may not like this series for a multitude of reasons. The only problem I personally had with it, was how long the series goes. I am not a huge fan of long-running animes because of filler episodes, or it drags on sometimes, but that is just me. Another thing I'd like to point out, is this is an anime that is not meant to be watched seriously. At all. There are many serious moments when it comes to death, loneliness, or family, which I will point out makes the story even more interesting and will sometimes leave you with a new perspective on the little things around you. This anime series is meant to be watched solely for entertainment. The emotional parts and situations will definitely get to you when they come, but for the most part, this is an anime that is just fun to watch simply for the heck of it. If you are a fan of long-running animes, love action, comedy, and stories of friendships and family, this action-anime is just for you.",2016
4,"At first I was really excited for fairy, the first couple of episodes were alright, but then it just started going down hill. The story started getting very repetitive and the the characters weren't developing. I'm sorry if i'm hurting any fan boy or fan girls' feeling, but seriously, NO GOOD anime should have the crazy amount of fan service this one has. I know it's crazy, you can ACTUALLY make a good anime without all the panty and booby shots. But despite all of this I must give credit to the good things in fairy tail, for example, the music. It's quite nice and sometimes catchy. This anime also does a good job art wise and can be very bright at happy times, but very dark when its tense. Over all no, Fairy Tale is not my cup of tea, it might be yours, but I don't recommend it if your looking for a really great anime.",2014
5,"I recommend this anime for people who have not watched two many weekly Japanese animation series. The conveyance from manga to animation is incredible in both of depiction and visual effect,followed by outstanding soundtracks. Having watched a lot of Japanese anime series the story doesn't amuse me. The story follows a group of magicians that are members of a magic guild on a sci-fi medieval environment.There's a big variety of characters and magic skills but that are not the perks that will make the difference in comparison with other anime like Naruto,One Piece,Dragon Ball etc... Sometimes the plot gives you the impression that you have watched the scene somewhere else, especially on the long episode Arcs.",2014
10,"Anyone who hasn't read the manga can definitely agree Fairy Tail is charming, funny, but does contain its series moments. If you didn't know any better you would think Fairy Tail was children's show, but I wouldn't really recommend this show for younger audiences as it does have its darker moments.",2014
5,"well the first time i saw this anime i thought its amazing and it is. until the latest arcs got from bad to worst. i say this because this anime no longer offer us any NEW!! it's repetitive! the main character always has the spotlights and win every fights with crazy friendship power-ups which is for me, is ANNOYING as hell. i can't find any reason to root for the characters because they didn't lose that much. the fights at first were awesome but now it's just shitty.",2013
2,"Believe me when I say that I do not hate anime. Dragonball Z, Naruto and Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood are all anime that I like. And Fairy Tail steals from almost every one of them. The character's are bland, Natsu is a copy of Goku and Naruto and the women are just a Boobs with arms and legs. Every ""comedic"" moment I shook my head, while every moment I was supposed to rooting for the good guys I laughing my head off. The story is full of too many climaxes and not enough tension, every second episode was an epic moment, which made me not care for the character's. I mean I rooted more for Gajeel and Levy more than Natsu or Lucy. However when there are good parts in this show, they really good, like the introduction of Gildart. And the music is also really, really good.",2015
6,A very entertainment anime...,2015
5,"Perhaps I was predisposed to not liking this one since I'm typically not a fan of 100+ episode shounens, but after multiple people recommended it, I decided to give it a shot anyways.",2015
10,"I saw the whole 1st season on Netflix (I didn't see all of the episodes) and it's pretty great. I mean Natsu can eat fire and happy is a cat that has wings. It's not the best TV show but it's still pretty good. There are many characters with many characteristics in this show. It's very enjoyable and a little funny. There are some moments that are unexpected and surprising. Most of the characters are epic like Natsu, Erza, Gray, etc.. ",2014
2,"Popularity does not always mean something is good and I discovered that after watching this bad anime. Horrible story, very repetitive, I forced myself to get through 46 episodes and I just couldn't take it anymore so I dropped it. The plot is very interesting but unfortunately the writers don't even bother to follow it. When the Main Character Natsu is supposed to be looking for his father, it's all forgotten as he prioritizes the fairy tail guild than looking for his father. There's no character development whatsoever, characters are stunted. If you appreciate stories with character development, and progression in every episode, you're definitely going to hate fairy tail, it's a must NOT watch.",2014
10,I really don't know how best to write this...,2014
4,"Fairy Tail is a series that you'll either love or hate. But this is a mediocre series as it's still enjoyable despite its flaws. After hearing about the popularity for the series shooting up and how everyone was talking about it and how good it was, I decided to give it a try. I was a bit worried as some people have also gave it negative reviews and I felt entertained by it but it was so annoying that I wanted to stop!",2015
8,"Overall, Fairy Tail is a pretty good series even if I find it clichéd in terms of other shonen anime (for those unfamiliar, its a term used for anime based on manga and some of these anime do have a familiar formula.) The story is about Lucy Heartfilia, a girl who is looking to join the legendary wizard guild known as Fairy Tail. She runs into a fire wizard for the guild Natsu Dragneel and his friend Happy, become friends and go on missions to get paid. Along the way, we meet other characters such as Natsu's icy rival Gray, the fierce warrior knight Erza, etc. Its animation is pretty good from a certain perspective, the voice cast is pretty good despite a few hiccups here and there, the writing is good despite some problems in some areas and it takes a while to get its footing just right. So yeah, pretty good series. I recommend it.",2016
9,"Fairy tail, directed by Shinji Ishihara and written by Hiro Mashima is a phenomenal work that I would recommend to anyone looking to start an anime series. Even though it is long running series I believe it is worth the watch. The animation is flawless as well as its character development. For this reason I give it 9 stars instead of 10. The reason I drop it a star is because of the battles. Sometimes the fights between the characters get a little repetitive and sometimes boring. Also on occasion there are a few annoying characters but overall the main cast is enjoyable. In review this is one of my favorite anime of all time and will continue to be far into the future.",2016
10,"When I first saw Fairy Tail on Netflix I wasn't really into anime because I'd seen some hardcore ones that made me pretty uncomfortable. Fairy Tail just has this really amazing way of showing people that family isn't who you're related to, it's who earns the title. It also has a really fun and light feel to it for a long time before diving into the more 'my adrenaline hasn't been this high since I jumped out of a plane' situations. I think it's an anime that you have to see in order to decide if you like it or not. There's a lot more feelings after the first- say five episodes because you start getting a better view of the characters backstory and personalities.",2016
10,"In India,some of the most popular anime series are DBZ,Naruto,Pokemon,etc.. Fairy Tail probably is not as popular as those but is as good as those. All the characters are funny and serious at the same time.It is an outstanding anime series.The story line and the plot is also good. The animation is superb. Actually It is getting better and better in every season.There are 7 seasons till now.The pace of this series is pretty smooth. Friendship is the main source of this anime. It is the kind of anime that will keep you at the edge of your seat while watching. But it may contain some nude scenes or half nude scenes. Maybe it's created for adults.. hey who am I kidding? children can watch too.. At the end of the day it's anime only. I hope it will be more popular in India in Coming years. Well if you haven't watched it then what are you waiting for...",2016
8,Drew Barrymore is well known for her quirky acting and distinct personality. But now movie goers across the country will begin seeing her in a new light- director.,2009
9,"If you like to be entertained and you enjoy seeing some of the best actresses working today, you should see this film. Ellen Page is a delight. I thought she did more with this role than she did with Juno. Kristen Wiig was her usual funny self, The rest of the cast, including Zoe Bell (excellent in Tarantino's Deathproof), Juliette Lewis, Marcia Gay Harding, Daniel Stern, Drew, Jimmy Fallon, all performed well. That says something about Drew's directing. She elicited excellent performances out of her cast, the film was well shot, the sound and editing were nicely done and I look forward to seeing what Drew can do on her next effort.",2009
8,"I attended the World Premiere of ""Whip It"" at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. This is quite an impressive directorial debut for Drew Barrymore (who also stars).",2009
10,"I attended a screening of this on Wednesday night (the 9th) with a Q&A with Drew after the movie. This movie was superb. It was done very well. I really liked the score and the music selection (from Peaches to MGMT) was amazing. The story is really good and so realistic...it wasn't cheap. Drew said she wanted to direct this movie because it was close to her heart, and you can tell it is because of the final product. You can tell she put a lot of effort into this one. Ellen Page and Marcia Gay Harden were GREAT in this! I loved every scene they were in together...(btw, Drew was REALLY nice and answered my question). Kristen Wiig, Juliette Lewis, Drew, Landon Pigg, and the young lady who plays Bliss's best friend Pash (I forget this actress's name) were wonderful. There is everything in this movie...romance, drama, mild humorous violence, and comedy. The film also explained the sport of roller derbying very well. Good research Drew! My final rating: 9.5/10 GO SEE IT!",2009
9,"In a sense this is a 6 or 7: a kind of kookie inspirational sports movie - fun, energetic, easy to watch and easy to like.",2010
8,"Enticed by free t-shirts and comfortable seats, two of my friends and I made the journey to Alexandria last Saturday to catch the sneak Preview of Whip It. Upon our arrival, our expectations were not high, as none of us were fans of Drew Barrymore.",2009
10,"Caught a preview of this and was really glad I did. The writing and characters were very genuine. There were lots of laughs and emotion and great moments you can't help but root for the girls. Drew, Ellen, Alia, Kristin, Marcia, Juliet, Eve and the rest just tore it up on the screen. It was nice to see some of these girls, like Drew & Kristin, in roles as real people as opposed to just caricature's. I never knew how roller derby was even played but now I'm gonna look for a local league to go watch - those girls rock! I ended the film feeling like I was best buds with all of them. This definitely shows that Drew will have quite a career directing and that Juno wasn't a one-hit-wonder for Ellen, either. You won't want to miss this one.",2009
8,"Drew Barrymore's directorial debut is a little gem. It could have been called Juno on Skates, such are the comparisons, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. Sure, Bliss Cavendar is almost identical to Juno MacGuff (and not just because Ellen Page plays them both), it follows a similar 'finding oneself' story arc, there are eccentric yet lovable parents and it prides itself on the unique dialogue flowing throughout; however Whip It has something up its sleeve to give it its own recognisable edge – roller-derby. Fun doesn't come any thicker, faster or sillier than roller-derbying. Barrymore understands this and appropriately places the underground sport front and centre. The editing is occasionally too quick meaning you can't always see what is going on, but you are caught up in the atmosphere so much it doesn't really matter.",2009
5,"This movie was not as good as I thought it would be. Ellen Page is sweet and she is obviously very talented. However, she is starting to come off as a whiner to me. She was not quite as sarcastic, and she did not try to be as ""cool"" as she was in Juno, but she is still a little annoying for some reason. Drew Barrymore's performance was really disappointing to me. I felt she did very little and her role was almost a ""cameo"". She just pops up from time to time, says very little, and tries to act tough. Also, let me ask you this? Does Ellen Page look 21? No, she looks like she is 14. How in the world are her teammates surprised when they find out she is only 17? Also, being a person who has roller skated for over 30 years, I guess I found it hard to believe that Bliss would be the fastest person out there when they were doing time trials. She looked slow and awkward. They guy that Bliss falls for looks like a loser. My wife was like, ""why is she even bothering with that ugly guy?"" I didn't get it.",2009
2,"I don't know why I expected a roller derby movie directed by, of all people, Drew Barrymore, to be any good. Perhaps I thought an IMDb rating meant something. In this case, it didn't.",2010
8,While it's a coming of age story we've seen before the film being set against roller derby makes it's something new and different. I saw this movie yesterday at TIFF and the screenwriter was there for the Q&A. This story is taken from her experiences discovering roller derby and many of the characters are based on real people. The writer is also from Texas and grew up near Austin where the story is set. Ellen Page and Marcia Gay Harden are excellent and the mother/daughter scenes are very real. Ellen Page did all her own stunts - learning to skate which adds a lot to the movie. Many of the older actresses did many of their stunts as well so the wipe outs and the scrapes and bruises are real!! Kristen Wigg is also great - one of the first times I've seen her be a real person on screen instead of just a funny character.,2009
4,"I am a big fan of Ellen Page, Drew Barrymore and Alia Shawkat. Naturally I had high hopes that this would be a unique, quirky, indie and generally good movie. What a let down!",2010
2,"When drama is rushed it can feel like the slowest thing in the world. The characters never get any time to breathe. The turmoil that they go through feels so compact, tidy, and meager that it's like your watching nothing at all. The quest for life's answers in the ""missunderstood teenager"" way, with the mandatory pushy mother and the quiet but understanding father seems like a subject done before. This movie is way too bland, stale, and unbelievable to really find the heart. I compare it to Bend it like Beckham, but without the good, funny or interesting parts. I liked the idea of this film, it had potential. Ellen Paige is great, as always, but the rest of the cast could have been exchanged for puppets and no on would have been able to tell the difference. I thought the ending too obvious and forced compared to the rest of it, and needed a more inspired and extended premise and execution for fullest success. It seemed rushed and inconsistent with the buildup to it. The movie is, too be frank, about a bunch of girl riding around in circles on rollerskating. And just as exiting as that sounds.",2010
5,"Greetings again from the darkness. Disappointing, yet entertaining film version of the Shauna Cross novel brought to us by first time director Drew Barrymore. I say disappointing because it really looks like they filmed the rough draft of the screenplay. It could have been so much more with a little effort and work on the script. Entertaining for all the other reasons! ",2009
9,"Whip It and Bend It Like Beckham are so similar, but so much different. Both tell the stories of teenage girls who sneak away to participate in sports, Soccer and Roller Derby. ",2009
5,"All of her life ""Bliss Cavendar"" (Ellen Page) has been pressured by her strong-willed mother to be a beauty pageant winner. She pretty much accepts this primarily because she doesn't really have any other options. Then one day she sees a roller derby game and suddenly knows what she wants to do and subsequently tries out for a team—and makes it. From then on she secretly devotes herself solely to the game and to her new boyfriend ""Oliver"" (Landon Pigg). Now rather than reveal any more of this movie and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that what starts out with good doses of comedy and action suddenly morphs into a drama (around the midway point) and it's at this time that the film lost its focus and cutting edge. Additionally, although Kristen Wigg (as ""Maggie Mayhem"") seemed to breathe some life into this movie, her comedic talents weren't utilized nearly enough. Same thing with Ari Graynor (""Eva Destruction""). In summation, this movie had some good potential but the director (Drew Barrymore) failed to take advantage of it and as a result I rate it as only average.",2015
5,"Whip It was a movie I wanted to like more than I did... The storyline was a little bit twee and predictable, with all of the 'small-town underdog' sports clichés... but, on the other hand, first-time director Drew Barrymore's handling of things is as charming as Barrymore herself seems to be... so, if you don't mind predictability, like roller derby, and just want a non-taxing feelgood film, then this could be it...",2012
5,I really wanted to like this movie.,2009

1,"I thought it was one of the very worst movies I've ever seen in my life. The writing was sophomoric, the directing was really poor, and some of the acting was poor too. Ellen Page was fabulous, as always, but even she couldn't pull this one out of the toilet. It was laughingly bad. The plot was weak to begin with, but the weakness was compounded by really dumb plot devices added willy-nilly throughout the movie. A fire marshal? Really? Her friend just up and kisses Birdman, out of the blue? Please. And the swimming pool scene had me howling with laughter at how bad it was. I really thought I was going to like the movie. I love Drew, I love Ellen Page, Juliette Lewis cracks me up, I love Jimmy Fallon, and I was really looking forward to seeing roller derby. Yet even my positive prejudice couldn't save this one. Really really poor job.",2010
4,"whom is great, but otherwise, I didn't really care for the film. I mainly didn't like it because I care nothing about roller derby. I don't know anything about and don't care too. If it had been about something I liked more, like ice skating for example, I think I would have liked the movie a lot more.",2010
10,"I went into this movie with rather high expectations. Ellen Page delivers yet another stunning performance as Bliss Cadaver, and Drew Barrymore proves herself well worthy of the title of director. Marcia Gay harden also delivers as Bliss's overbearing mother. The film is thoroughly enjoyable to watch, at the same time it is raw, emotional, and real. The cinematography during the roller derby scenes is spectacular, done in such a way that you can really feel the emotion of the sport. The movie very definitely does not disappoint. i fully expect best picture/director nods for Barrymore, as well as best a best actress nod for Ellen page, and a best supporting actress nod foe Marcia gay harden. all in all this a wonderful film, and is one of the years few must see movies. it is a wonderful story beautifully executed at the hands of Drew Barrymore. I give it a 10/10.",2009
9,"I got curious about this movie because I've been interested in roller derby (while the last time I roller skated was around time when I was 7-10, oops), because the movie has so many women on it, and lastly because Zoë Bell is in the film. It's always a pleasure to see her work on screen, whether it's acting or stunts.",2016

10,"I saw an ad for this series and didn't think I would like it. And it turned out it has the most brilliant pilot in my opinion. I love the subtle, undertone jokes. The drama is quite real, unlike, soap-opera ""grey's anatomy."" You get enough taste of every character and the things that nurses would have to deal with their job. I think the script is brilliantly written. If you expect typical hospital drama, you may not like this show. The humor is off-beat and quirky. This is the only show that I eagerly wait each week. Great characters and casts. I just wish the episodes are longer than 30 minutes and more than 10/12 episodes a season. I'm a big fan.",2009
9,"I must say give a big thumbs up for the new hit Showtime series ""Nurse Jackie"" which features one of the best and most hard working TV actresses around Edie Falco. Unlike Edie's award winning days as Carmela Soprano the elegant and naive mob housewife on HBO's ""The Sopranos"" this time her character is more blue collar yet she still has a dark nature to her no matter how caring she is. Edie is Jackie Peyton a nurse who charms and lights it up in this dark natured and raw funny comedy series one of the better made for TV in a long time.",2009
10,"I will admit, I didn't have much hopes for this show, due to my own ingrained prejudices. Halfway through season one, I was hooked and now I genuinely think it is one of the best shows I have seen (nothing will ever quite match up to The Wire however). This show is SO funny, dark, serious and perfectly blends gritty drama with laugh out loud comedy. ",2014
5,"Good premise. Decent first season. Then, not unlike too many other shows that start out with a lot of potential Nurse Jackie quickly runs off the rails and never gets back on track. This show suffers from the all-too-typical ""caricatures rather than characters"" syndrome. There are simply too many one dimensional cartoon characters in this show to even begin to take it seriously. ""Coop"". Zoey. Thor. All cartoonish immature 1 dimensional clowns. And that's simply unacceptable. So is its schizo nature of taking itself way too seriously then not taking itself seriously enough. And so is the problem of having no one to really care that much about. So in short, this show is neither here nor there, and as such, the net result is a big waste of time.",2015
6,I watched the first five seasons on cable and watched the last two on Netflix. I am a registered nurse (for 39+ yrs). I was a huge fan of the show's initial seasons. I had great hopes for it. ,2016
8,"I thought Showtime's new series""Nurse Jackie"" started off with good intentions and held promise but truth be known, I had little faith in it. It felt like a vehicle for its star, Edie Falco and though I respect her work, I couldn't understand how she could allow herself to get involved with a show that felt a little half baked.",2009
9,"Halfway through season one and I have developed an unexpected fondness for this dry, subtle and somewhat dark medical drama. ",2013
8,"When I heard that Edie Falco was in another TV drama I definitely had to check it out. I had hoped the writing was good, and I wasn't disappointed. Edie Falco as Nurse Jackie is brilliant as usual. She was great in The Sopranos and she doesn't disappoint in this. She is so gifted, she could make an alphabet recitation interesting. The character Jackie is troubled, complex and caring and she draws you in. The storyline is complex as I'm sure the character arcs will be. ",2011
10,"Edie Falco, best known for her role as Carmela Soprano on HBO's ""The Sopranos"" amazes viewers with her talent and versatility. ""Nurse Jackie"" is hilarious, dramatic, sensitive, touching, and feels very real. As someone who has spent time working in an ER, the nuances and interactions between the characters have me asking who wrote this, because this weird random stuff has totally happened. ",2009
1,"On the high wave of new shows coming out by Showtime recently, I was really looking forward to this. However it seems that they decided to go extremely base in this accurate portrayal of a nurse.",2009
3,"Don't get me wrong, the premise for Nurse Jackie is great. Edie Falco plays Jackie Peyton, a Vicodin addicted nurse whose whole world (and this series, it turns out) are held together by the hope that nobody will discover her dirty little secret. During the day, she's the Champion ER Nurse of All Time, showing both compassion and brains while bucking the system that promotes and protects profit-hungry hospitals and rock star egomaniac doctors at the expense of the everyday working man and woman. Bravo Jackie.",2011
2,"The ""2"" is so I could give 1 point to Edie Falco, who deserves better than this (her work in The Sopranos was marvelous). We made it through the pilot, wincing at all of the stereotypical characters, forced drama and mostly idiotic and predictable dialog. We added something new to the next episode - howls of laughter, as, if anything, the stereotypes grew worse, the drama more forced - but, oddly, the dialog grew so terrible to have become hilarious. Then we thought....we were fooled! This is just a very clever comedy!",2013
2,"I do agree with all the early reviews of this show. I loved season one. Second season not so great and now I've completely lost interest altho still turning it on. And always saying ""no more, they're crap"".",2011

8,"I noticed a lot of bad reviews from the boards concerning the last few seasons and Im surprised so many people feel the same way. I know the show has changed since its inception, but its still good. Maybe its because I'm watching whole seasons every year in just a few days, but I don't really see any ""downfall"" with the writing. What happened at the end of the 5th season was perfect. It made me laugh, gasp, and cringe all at the same time. I never saw it coming. The show did seem to really slow down around season 2 and 3, but its back and I'm glad i stuck with it. Say what you want about the show being boring, I still love it. Cant wait for next season to see what happens. I also wouldn't mind if it ended after season 6, but if it goes 7, that would be perfect.",2014
8,"Medical shows can be quite interesting with the patients, but with it being a Showtime series, I knew they would make it more intense. Plus with Edie Falco from the Sopranos and OZ; I thought it had a very good chance of being an enjoyable show.",2013
9,"1/24/18. Just finished watching the entire 7 seasons of Nurse Jackie. Wow. What a series! This is probably one of the best medical drama series I have seen, even though it is called a dramedy. Did not exactly liked the ending, but it was right for the series. Rather than call this Nurse Jackie, perhaps, they should have called it Jackie Peyton Addict, RN. The entire series was basically about a female addict who was a great nurse, despite her addiction and how she used drugs to deal with her hectic life. It is a well-done cautionary tale of how drug addiction ruins lives of those addicted and those who try to love and help them. Wonderful casting, great screenwriting and realistic depictions of emergency room medicine. Falco was excellent as Nurse Jackie and I am surprised she did not win more awards for her realistic portrayal of a high-functioning junkie until she wasn't. The 7 seasons just flew by. Catch this when you can.",2018

1,"So, they're trying to squeeze a few cents more out of the hype around the ""Saw""-type movies? Sadly the ones making this movie has no idea on how to keep the audience's interest up, no idea on how to create believable characters or make a decent movie that holds up for more than 15 minutes.",2010
1,"The entire point of this film was to shock, but the way it shocks is more by giving you the image with no point and no reasoning. Of course the film never sounded like it was ever going to be remembered for its script but this is beyond bad.",2010
1,"This movie is trash. It's a sick fetish-fueler for some weird cult to get off to. The plot is non-existent. If you want to know what this movie is about in a nutshell, here are some key plot points - mouth sewn to anuses, swallowing feces, and humans turned into slaves without dignity. People will say it's an original idea, but OF COURSE IT IS. It's never been done before because NO ONE HAS THOUGHT OF SOMETHING AS SICK AS THIS YET. After watching, I felt like I needed counseling, or something to make me forget the entire concept. On top of that, there is pathetic dialogue, acting, and directing. The movie literally ends without anything resolved and you just think ""What was the point of this?"" There's no greater idea, or hidden metaphors. The movie is about swallowing feces. DO NOT WATCH IT.",2010
7,"Well, where to start? Sat down and watched this after being told you have to see this to believe it. What did they mean? It'll make you sick, it'll make you turn your eyes away. I was very intrigued. I have been watching horror movies since my teens at the cinema and even earlier if I include the Hammer Horrors on late night TV.",2011
1,"Starting from a good idea, the director/writer totally screws it up, in my humble opinion. I started watching this because of the '100% medically accurate'-marketing, as I'm a student in medicine. It was far from accurate or realistic.. Not medically, not in any way. I'm only a student and still see some big mistakes. Obviously they hadn't even a nurse on the set.",2010
2,"Wow, what a pointless and redundant film.",2010
3,"This movie got a lot of hype for how bizarre, shocking and original it is. Unfortunately, the hype is wrong. The movie is a one-trick pony: once you get over the idea of connecting a bunch of people into a centipede, there is nothing else going on.",2010
8,"It is very difficult to review a movie called The Human Centipede (First Sequence). There is little chance one will be lured to a viewing under false pretences so if a movie delivers what you expect, is it not then an undisputable success? Yes and no as the film is a struggle between concept, execution and nausea but what is admirable, in addition to its fearless boundary pushing, is its restraint. Yes you read that correctly, restraint. Contrary to so many of the torture porn films that try to punch up the shock value through sadism The Human Centipede has almost no blood and lets your imagination fill in the horrific blanks.",2010
8,"I chose to watch this film based on its title. All I had heard were negative things and I was honestly preparing myself for a man that would explode into a poor quality cgi centipede that ate people or something. (I had not watched a trailer beforehand or really read any synopsis or critic reviews.) I was really expecting a terrible film which I could laugh at. After watching the film I was VERY surprised and immediately came online to check what others thought to now feel somewhat embarrassed to say I felt like this film had me pretty gripped, on the edge of my seat, feeling a lot of tension, some slightly sadder feelings and generally pretty satisfied...",2013
7,"I'm really glad and thankful there exist such as thing as Fantastic Film Festivals. Where else would you be offered the opportunity to watch sick-spirited and repulsive independent flicks like ""The Human Centipede"" on a big cinema screen? This is truly the type of movie that would never reach video stores or even e-bay and is directly intended for the international festival circuit. This film, commonly known already under its abbreviation THC, is everything you could possibly expect from a midnight crowd shocker/pleaser and then some! The plot and its main character are completely over-the-top absurd, the depiction of gore is gratuitous and nauseating and the tone of the movie is continuously surreal. It's the type of film where you are practically forced to think stuff like ""what kind of sick and depraved human mind could possibly have come up with such a horror concept"". The answer: Dutch born writer/director Tom Six. ",2010

3,"Okay, American tourists with a car that breaks down - of course they go wandering through the dark German woods (you could play a drinking game and have to take a shot every time they say ""Lindsay"" and ""Jenny"" to each other - you'd be wasted) - and they come about a remote house and wouldn't you know it - just their luck - the house belongs to a complete nutjob surgeon who used to separate conjoined twins and now is obsessed with stitching people together. I'm no doctor, but there seem to be major flaws in his medical design - oh well. The film is kooky but well made, the lead guy (who looks a bit like Lance Henrickson) gives 100% and is fine as the mad doctor but the whole concept reeks of teenage boys getting stoned for the first time and playing a game - let's come up with the grossest thing that could be done to you in surgery. That's what it plays like - a teenage boy horror/fantasy/gross out. But with films like Saw and Hostel, it was only a matter of time before there was something like this and before long, they'll be other weird concepts that will try and top this one. Look out for ManBaby - see we sew a baby on the back of a guy who hates kids! It's creepy and it's funny! Hoo boy. Of course there's an itch to see something like this - the same itch that made people pay money to go see a freak show back in the day.",2010

I've been watching plenty of bad movies for fun lately, the last ones I've seen were The Worst Horror Movie Ever Made, Troll 2, and The Room. All very fun and entertaining bad movies but The Human Centipede was the opposite of fun and entertaining.",2010
7,"Beneath the visuals and suspense, this movie is ultimately psychological. If Tom Six, by way of keeping this movie under two hours, manages to lose some people's attention span or over-saturate the viewers with shock, it's because he didn't make the invitation to his mindset alluring enough. But this movie is an invitation nonetheless, and he would probably prefer we stay much longer.",2012
4,"There are two kind of horror films: fantasy and realistic. Some even try to do a little mixture of both and can get away with it. A little low budget film that just got a lot of word of mouth made it pretty big. The way I heard of The Human Centipede was a challenge from my fiancé's brother's girlfriend, she knows my love of horror films and she said I would never be able to handle this movie. I laughed and said that I would check it out and I was expecting something really horrific, after all I've seen A Serbian Film and Irreversiblewas this really worse than those two? So I actually bought the film without seeing it first; my mistake. I watched the interview with the director first on the special features because I knew what the film was about but was curious if the director was going to talk about where he got the idea from: he joked about how a child molester should have his mouth glued to a fat trucker's butt. At that point I knew I was in for one heck of a ride.",2012

9,"Perfect fantasy show about how we'd all like the world to be. It's an ""Ozzie and Harriet"", ""Bonanza"" or ""Waltons"" for the 21st Century.",2011
8,"I find this program to be a refreshing change from House who acts like a jerk to everyone including the woman who loves him and treats everyone like dirt. I have seen Doctor Movies and TV shows as far back as I can remember including the first Dr. Kildare of 1938 starring Lew Ayres that one was made before I came along. I have also seen the TV series with Richard Chamberlain and Ben Casey with Vince Edwards as well as every other one to come along with the exception of the Soap General Hospital. I think this program's writers have taken a new approach and even though one critic has written a very negative review saying they didn't like it and compared It to Burn Notice. I think that is completely wrong and missed the differences between this and other shows. For one thing it already looks like if there is going to be a love story it may develop normally without all the pit falls that keep up the sexual tension but get old fast in most series. That may fall to the secondary cast members leaving Hank and Jill to concentrate on solving medical challenges that are going to come up not only with Hank's practice but Jill's desire to open a free clinic. If I were reading reviews to see if this id a show I might like I'd tell that person to go to the USA Network site and start with the pilot, and I would add a line from the old Alka-Seltzer commercials. ""Try it you'll like it"". But then you'll have to decide for your self, because you're the only one who will know in the end if you like it or not. I hope you do and then tall a few friends about it.",2009
8,"I really enjoyed this show for it's first season. I thought the characters were really likable, they were very funny, and some of the extremely exotic conditions rich people were coming down with (all on long island, who knew?) made the show fun and rewarding. The Dr (Hank) is great and the idea of saving someone at a rich recluse's house, then being given an amazing apartment, money, and the chance to rub elbows with the secretive elite plays on my fantasies terrifically. A lot of the rich characters fall into a typical neurotic mold but there are some like Boris the house owner that creates enough mystery to keep you watching for the next episode. The son with the distant father and crazy girlfriend is a great character. Evan the brother is Hilarious and has great chemistry with the main character. The Indian assistant Divya is really funny and I like the subplot of her dreams and her conflicts with traditional Indian cultural values. I thought the girlfriend character was OK but it didn't add much and the conflicts weren't very strong or justified. Overall a really fun show.",2009
8,"With the dearth of scripted shows on the 4 major networks these days, I've been forced to check out the series on USA, TNT, etc. ""Royal Pains"" is a delight! I'm sorry the first season is over already. The HD is brilliant, the scenery around the Hamptons is glorious.....a great back drop for a really good series, full of humor and drama and just a mix of ""MacGyver"" thrown in. It's important to me in a series that the supporting cast is just as strong as the lead character, and here we have an eclectic group who complement each other, and their interaction seems effortless. I do agree with another comment that the chemistry between Hank and Jill needs to be tweaked in some way, but aside from that I do look forward to many more years of ""HankMed"" and I will be one of the first to by the DVD.",2009
9,"Honestly, when I stared watching this show my expectations were pretty low. I thought the story seemed pretty boring and the setting - well I thought I've seen it all before. Moreover, I did not like ANY of the characters at first and some even annoyed me (like Jil and Evan - especially Evan!). However, the writers really develop all characters very well and after a couple of episodes I simply started to love each of them. Everyone has their own story and you simply get drawn into it and keep on wanting more. There is never too much drama, however there is ALWAYS something going on that keeps you watching. I believe this show has everything it takes: a bit of action, a bit of drama, a lot of fun and looots of nice, expensive locations, houses and cars. Do not give up on this show after the first episodes! Hank will not let you down, I swear!",2012
10,"This show is great! I think it has the perfect mix of, well everything...the only thing I don't like is the character Jill, I don't think the actress is a very good actress she seems to be trying too hard, other than that I love everything about the show. I love Dr. Lawson and Evan!!! I can't wait until next summer!! Think this show has great potential. I love the different story lines and illnesses. I'm interested to see all the complex stories they can come up with. I have noticed that it's usually the simplest answer. I guess the appeal is as patients, we want a doctor that is caring and smart...in really life that doesn't really happen. I'm stoked for next season!!",2009

I love doctor/lawyer/medical/murder/investigation/puzzle type shows, and this show totally hooked me by the first commercial break in the pilot! This is the first original show on USA that I've seen, because my life is so busy that I just don't watch that much TV, but I have made room in my schedule for Hank. I love the fact that Hank isn't just treating the ultra-rich, but also people who need him and can't possibly pay. I also love the fact that the series started with interesting and complicated characters and I am really looking forward to learning more about Jill, Divya and Boris. Some of the personality types that Hank has come across are not just limited to the ultra rich, I've seen people who are obsessed with WebMD and pro-biotic yogurt as well as people who try to stay out of the limelight but at the same time know everything that's going on with everybody. I can't wait to see what happens next! ROCK ON USA!!",2009

7,"I'm a sucker for doctor-related shows, but I'm usually severely turned off by the ones which start diving into soap-opera territory or are used to probe the lives of filthy rich doctors and the many women they sleep with and the many things they drink and their big houses. There were a few shows which started to break with that trend early on in this decade, most notably House, which showcases doctors performing medicine as opposed to a show all about the doctors and not about the patients. That may have changed, but my point remains that it was the original premise of the show.",2009
9,"I have waited until today to write my thoughts on USA's new show Royal Pains, which debuted this summer and aired its final episode yesterday. Immediately I was taken with the story. The writers create instant sympathy for emergency room doctor, Hank, who loses his job because he wouldn't cater to a wealthy patient over another lower paying one. He does however manage to help both of them, but in the end the wealthy patient dies. He is sued by the wealthy patient's family and is unable to find a new job. Then his shallow fiancée leaves him, since he's not making anymore of the big bucks or has a promising career. Hank sinks into depression until his brother, Evan, a fun quirky character, helps pull him out of this by taking him away to the exclusive Hamptons for the summer. ",2009

8,I've began to watch this show because i liked the concept. A doctor who makes house calls in The Hamptons. I liked it from the beginning and et has a good story. On the other hand it's just not my kind of thing but it's just interesting enough to keep my attention. Mark Feuerstein and Paulo Costanzo are a very good acting duo and the acting overall is very very good. So overall i have to say acting is very good and the story is just average => 6/10,2012
2,"Where have the writers gone? The writing is very monotone. The characters have lost there charm and creativeness. Bring back Boris and the wife. Bring back the charm and fireworks of Hank and Jill. Bring back the plot twists. The Hank and Jill fire has been extinguished and Evan's life is DULL. The last creative episode I recall was Boris and the poison. That episode was full of good, crisp writing.I hope this show is not turning into a ""formula"" show.I know there is only 8 episodes per season but do not wait until the end for a GOOD script. Last season and so far(up to 2/8/12) episode the scripts are DULL. Bring back the fire and passion of the old Royal Pains.",2012
5,"'Royal Pains'... .. yes, it did eventually become exactly that!! Maybe 6 stars - the entire series is like an hour-long, weekly video presentation for super-luxury real estate in The Hamptons (and designer clothing and accessories for women). With some very good performances, and some blatantly awkward ones as well, it must be said that casting for this series was mostly to blame for its failings.. yea, and lots of the writing was pretty poor too. One of the best performances is from Brooke D'Orsay. Every time on-screen, no matter the circumstance, standing head-and-shoulders above, she is just so spot-on in her role as Paige Collins (no wonder she's now appearing on several other shows). Streaming is probably not the best way to view this type of series. There's LOTS can become tiring VERY quickly when viewed without a weekly break (notably several of the more annoying and poorly acted characters). Now halfway through season 5.. and it's lookin very doubtful will be able to hang on till the finish (even with the much-used capability of streaming-forward). This would have been a considerably better production had more 'real-world' situations and people been allowed to surface on a more frequent basis... and should the catch-phrases 'concierge-medicine'..and especially 'Hank-Med' never be heard again.. that would be more than agreeable. PS.. did eventually finish season 5.. and all I can say.. can't help die-hard fans.. but for anyone else maybe thinking of buyin season 5 episodes.. do not bother!! Its gotten way-off-track.. this show REALLY should call it quits, and take the money and run.",2014
9,"Hank is a great caring doctor who winds up treating the ultra rich in the Hamptons. He takes on the most bizarre cases. Evan, his brother, only adds to the humor in the show with his wisecrack comments and escapades. You have to watch it! The guy he lives with -- Boris -- adds a slight mystery to show. And his assistant has enough medical knowhow and personal baggage going on to help out with the plot as well. The last main character is Jill -- she is the head of the local hospital and she and Hank are the romance builders of the show. She helps us show us different sides of Hank and plays along with Evan. The assistant also helps bring in a lot of humor with her interactions with Evan. The show is a nice refreshing medical show on the same lines as House -- but with more likable characters and more off the wall illness!",2010
6,"This is a very charming series unfortunately without much depth of plot or character development. Anyone stepping onto a ladder will inevitably fall and lapse into a seizure requiring complex emergency medical treatment. Once a character has been stabilized, they will subsequently be diagnosed with a rare disease and will eventually be cured after suffering numerous heart attacks, more seizures, various bacterial infections and so on. Almost no one dies.",2015
10,"I think Royal Pains is a great show. We follow the former ER doctor Hank who is a great guy that is interested in helping people no matter what social status they have. He loses his job while saving a regular kid after saving a rich man. But while he is saving the other kid the rich person that has given the hospital a lot of money dies. And he is wrongly accused. His brother Evan persuades him to go to the Hampton's over the weekend to get his mind off of things. In the Hampton's he becomes a ""doctor for hire"" after a dramatic save of a young woman. This is were the story takes in, a lot of funny interesting characters. A lot happens and even though Hank is not interested in the life of the rich he is persuaded to stay by his brother. See a few episodes and you are hooked! 8/10",2009

4,"This is not a kind of show where you anxiously wait to see a new episode. It's kind of show that you can watch once in a while and you didn't miss anything. The idea is, a doc happens to help out a wealthy patient and soon after he becomes a private doc for secretive and freaky upper 5% wealthy patients in a preppy area. The show is hardly anyhow developing and it goes over and over again. A genius doc Dr. Hank Lawson Feuerstein is a weak and boring character. Evan R. Lawson is his younger brother, which a very cheesy and ridiculous character played by Paulo Costanzo, that tries hard to be funny but he keeps failing at it. I was impressed by Reshma Shetty, she appears to be very talented and interesting, but unfortunately her role is not built well either. Her desperate character is written into a lot of overacting and the show is static and repetitive. I'm starting to believe people would watch almost anything if it shows the glorious life of rich people. As far as it has mansions, expensive sports cars and giant pools, people will watch it. It's a little bit neat show, but I can't see much beyond that there.",2013
7,"I went into this movie with certain expectations. The expectations were met. There are no real surprises in this movie. Early in the movie, you know the set-up, man (and woman) against nature. All of the main players are likable. Their character is developed. You care about these people! The scenery is beautiful. There are plot contrivances, like shoddy cellphone coverage and random injuries. Of course, there has to be poor cellphone coverage or there would be no movie! You would just call for help and that would be the end of the movie! There has to be injuries to add insult to ""injury"" to the players struggling against the odds already. The ending is truly thought evoking instead of cliché. It could not have ended better. I recently saw the movie ""Thirst."" The two movies are very similar in plot line. This movie was enjoyable. I found ""Thirst"" tedious and overly predictable.",2011
6,"Plot: The possibilities of getting lost in the Grand Canyon escalate dramatically if you choose not to properly plan your trip into the canyon, use uncertified guides (esp with drinking problems), no wilderness survival training, no maps or compass, and have no way of communicating with the outside world.

I must point out that idea about wolves in the Grand Canyon Park and outlying areas attacking people is totally absurd! Whoever thought this one up did not do much research because wolves, though they have been spotted in these areas on occasion, are for the most part rare and shy of humans. Timber wolves, which the movie portrays, mainly exist in Canada and the northwestern states towards Canada. So this part is completely unrealistic for an already busy plot. Wolves only act like this when they are starving to death, but the Timber wolves shown in this movie looked pretty well fed.",2012
7,"The only reason I was interested in watching The Canyon was the presence of actress Yvonne Strahovski, who is brilliant as Agent Walker in Chuck, one of my favorite TV programmes.However, The Canyon ended up being an entertaining thriller with decent performances and a generally good rhythm, although it is not very memorable.",2009
4,"If you're looking for something with the look and feel of an almost-major motion picture and the writing of a really boring b movie, this is definitely the movie for you.",2010
7,"I, like this movie, have very little to say about it. It has been done before. In various locations, with a variety of protagonist and with very similar ending. The writing on this one was not very memorable with the one exception of the alcoholic guide played by Eion Bailey. The cinematography was outstanding, great images of one of the United States great remaining natural wonders. ",2009
7,"I am well aware that us viewers have different taste and likes when it comes to movies, but I think this movie has been put down where as I think it is worth watching. The story line is nothing really new, but the acting was solid, sure no Oscar coming their way, but the actors got the story line across well enough. The film is set in nice surroundings even if it was not shot in the Grand Canyon as some people have pointed out, it is still eye pleasing. If the producers would have had a bigger budget, bigger stars I think this would have been received better by the general public, but it still makes for good viewing for what it is.",2011
3,"The general plot line of stranded individuals in any particular setting is nothing new to Hollywood, as we have seen many marooned protagonists go up against mother nature, blood thirsty villains, and both fictitious and very real beasts alike. However, of all the places we have seen films set in, the grand canyon is mostly new. With a fresh setting we should have endless possibilities and plenty of room for an exciting and unconventional script. Unfortunately, 'The Canyon' cannot capitalize on it's sources. The final product that director Richard Harrah presents us with is nothing short of boring film-making, extremely grating 'come on' moments, erroneous use of wolves, and a very empty script. The actors are very talented and do what they can with the material, but not even talented actors can save a script that is as empty, dry, and desolate as the grand canyon itself. There are a few shining moments, but not enough to carry this movie into the entertaining zone. There is a nice gore scene (that will surely make anyone who watches it wince), the scenery is put to very beautifully shot aesthetic use, and of course nicely acted moments that accurately evoke the hopelessness of the situation and sometimes are even ironically witty. Notice that I have yet to mention the word 'thrilling' or 'thriller', which is extremely sad because this movies is obviously supposed to be just that - a thriller. 'The Canyon' simply can't cut it as a thriller and is obviously too straight forward to be anything else. Avoid this one just as you would avoid going into the grand canyon with a guide who could possibly double as the homeless guy who shines shoes outside of your office.",2009

3,"This movie was so cheesy I had register to this site just to get this off my chest. Horrible movie. The plot, stuck in the grand canyon. Boring enough right? Well hey you know what the movie 127 hours pulled it off so a boring plot isn't my problem with this movie. Seems like it almost had potential but it was so unrealistic I couldn't take it. The girl gets attacked by wolves;one tackles her to the ground face to face and somehow doesn't bite her in the neck or face? In a following scene she gets attacked again, tackled to the ground, but only gets bit in the leg? Then she stabs the wolf only for it to die instantly? After watching this I wished my girlfriend would suffocate me too. It really trips me out that you people write good reviews for movies like this. Someone please explain to me how people are rating this 7/10?",2011
7,"Well I am positively surprised how good this movie actually was. Not sure why sometimes it's branded 'horror'because it's more like dramatic thriller. I liked the story and I liked the characters who were rich and believable. For the first time 'a chick' didn't annoy me:)and there was more to her than meets the eye. The story begins when a couple of newlyweds decides to take a trip to the Grand Canyon. Their guide is a rough, heavy drinking guy, who promises them an unforgettable experience. The trip however does not go as planned. I think this film is a solid piece. Don't expect more than 140min of adventure/survival flick and you won't be disappointed. It kept me focused and interested. Well worth seeing.",2010
5,"As a veteran of nine expeditions down the Grand Canyon I was skeptical of whether one would get the feel of what the Canyon is like in its more remote areas considering that it wasn't filmed there. I'm happy to report that with the overview shots of the actual Grand Canyon coupled with what seems to have been carefully selected non-Grand Canyon sites to shoot this movie, I completely recognized the Grand Canyon I'm so familiar with. The slot canyon the honeymooning couple explored not long after the opening scenes suggested strongly to me the slot canyon at the end of Deer Creek just before the creek plunges over Deer Creek Falls into the Colorado River and other locations reminded me of some of my other favorite Grand Canyon sites like National Canyon, Shinumo Creek (near Bass Trail) and the Silver Grotto of Shinumo Wash (not technically in the Grand Canyon proper, but upstream of it in Marble Canyon, still in GCNP). So for someone seeking a vicarious look at what the more remote parts of the Grand Canyon might look like you should appreciate this film for that.",2011
6,I was sick at home watching movies a couple months ago. The Canyon came on and was a slow start. Just as I was about to change the channel it got really good. There are no surprises throughout the movie but it is good to watch what people act like when a situation occurs. When two people who are opposite are trying to work on their relationship have to come together to find their way out of one. It's very sad and intense because of the constant drama and slow pain when someone gets hurt. It really shows that love is thicker than darkness and one person will do anything to keep a person alive and their spirits up to survive. No matter the outcome. Not a spoiler! The trailer shows what I was just talking about. However I did click the box just in case someone felt I was spoiling it. Hope you enjoy the movie.,2012
7,"Newlyweds Nick (Eion Bailey) and Lori (Yvonne Strahavski) stumble into the honeymoon-from-hell when they innocently and foolishly allow a grizzled old cowpoke to talk them into taking an unauthorized mule-trip into the heart of the Grand Canyon. When Henry (Will Patton), the guide, is bitten by a rattlesnake, the couple is left to fend for themselves in this unfamiliar and brutally hostile terrain with little or no survival skills to help get them through the experience.",2012
5,"Let me be brutally honest: I watched this film for Yvonne Strahovski. That and I'm a sucker for a thriller/horror peppered with high stakes and survival. 'The Canyon' is one of those movies you go into expecting one thing, and... well, you more or less get it. That isn't to say it's terribly unoriginal or inept. In fact, I feel I'm downplaying how good it is in parts. There are those frustrating scenes that have you talking to the leads as if they were your own half-witted friends ('Why did you do that?', 'You idiot', etc.), but it has some powerful passages as well.",2012
5,"Basically, this is a mediocre movie. I was primarily led to watch it from comments that the setting was the Grand Canyon and that the cinematography was good. However, apart from a few shots of descending into the Grand Canyon, the rest of the story was actually filmed near Moab, Utah, and not in the Grand Canyon. The slot canyon in the movie was Antelope Canyon near Page, Arizona (also not in Grand Canyon). There are slot canyons in Grand Canyon (such as Deer Creek and Matkatamiba) but they are a lot harder to get to for filming and are not seen in the movie.",2009
1,"One of the most stupid films I have (almost) seen. I tried to find an excuse for the director of the film, but there is no one except if he had maybe been abused as a child and for that reason wanted to imply a lot of violence with no film trace at all. If you can watch this film until the end, then you will never consider any film boring. It is a wasted time and money, wasted talent of actors and camera which is beautiful as the Grand Canyon. However, everything else is so stupid as most insulting offense. There is no plot in the film, just two people lost in the wildness - and that is exactly about all. I cannot remember the film I could not watch until the end, but this is the one. Pls, do not forget if you get into watching this movie you will be able to leave the projection, go to business lunch, come back after an hour and you will not need anyone to tell you what happened meanwhile.",2010
6,"The Canyon is a new version of a very familiar story. It does a relatively effective job of telling that story, but does nothing with it that hasn't been done before. The result is a legitimately entertaining but ultimately forgettable movie.",2010
4,"This is one of those films that almost lost me due to it's terrible beginning. A crushingly slow B movie was in full play when a change suddenly took place. The undeserving husband adopted a more believable face towards survival and the wife's portrayals of frustration accurately increased. The viewer now gets to see a man and wife trapped in an unforgiving expanse, leading to some fresh turns. Interesting action along with life lessons made what could have been a run away bomb entertaining. A good, reasonably thought out ending really helped. A nice little tricky survival film that may fit your mood when the video idea well runs dry.",2014
4,"Nick and Lori, a recently married couple from Chicago, decide to make an mule-ride excursion into the Grand Canyon for their honeymoon, however not having the correct permit to do that, the couple are saddened (him decidedly more then her, as Lori is more than content to merely have sex all weekend in the cheap motel that they're staying at), until they meet up with a grizzled old geezer willing to be their tour guide deep into the canyon. But then a lethal snake bite kills the guide, leaving the hapless couple alone in the wilderness.",2010
7,"In the vein of Survive (or Alive, if you saw it in the 70s like I did), The Canyon traps human beings in unforgiving terrain only to push the limits of survival. There are a couple of really shocking scenes here, one involving a rattle snake and another very disturbing one involving an amputation, but if the kids close their eyes for a few minutes there isn't anything else that would make this anything but a PG film. Some of it isn't very plausible, in fact the entire idea of the heroine suddenly becoming Grizzly Adams and fighting off wolves with her bare hands, creating a stretcher out of thin air, cauterizing a wound with a red hot knife, and keeping her beauty and sense of humor through it all, is actually pretty ridiculous if you think about it, but it doesn't matter that much: this is a disaster movie of sorts, so don't think about it. It'll keep you going, keep you interested and engaged, and from time to time it will make you cringe. But, be warned, the ending is the anti-climax of all anti-climaxes.",2009

Then towards the end I guess she is just tired of dragging him and dogs looking at her so what does she do to her beloved new husband, who when they are rescued could lead a normal life with what there able to do with prosthetics these days...smothers him for no apparent reason just as a helicopter is in the distance. Also the stupidity of climbing a precarious cliff and leaning way out holding a shaky rock on the most narrow ledge of the climb not even halfway up to wave your cell phone around is begging for disaster.

No one in this new space has time for her so she spends her time exploring her new neighborhood with an talkative local boy named Wybie Lovat (Robert Bailey Jr.). After discovering the odd neighbors all of whom are true characters, she is still bored somehow.",2009
10,"As a Neil Gaiman fan, I was, of course, very happy with the book ""Coraline"", and was extremely excited to hear that a movie was being made for it. I had very high expectations from director Henry Selick after seeing 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' and 'James and the Giant Peach'.",2009
8,"Henry Selick, the director of "" The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ""James and the Giant Peach"", once again takes us to a world full of imagery and wonder...but this time...some of it is actually frightening. It was filled with such magic and enchantment that I completely forgot that it was a dark tale..until the occasional scares filled the air. It has some highly fun and amusing characters in it also, and that is the strongest thing of the movie. After viewing it, I came to the conclusion it was basically an ""Alice in Wonderland"" tale (girl entering new and strange world, plus the cat that talks makes it obvious) but this world has a dark twist. Filled with a great cast and terrific visionary, I feel this movie is fun for all ages (who says kiddos shouldn't be scared?)",2009

SPOILER ALERT The movie starts out introducing Coraline, voice actor Dakota Fanning, who is new to the Pink palace and is soon introduced to the black cat, voice actor Keith David, and Wybie Lovat, voice actor Robert Bailey Jr., who both are stalking Coraline. We then meet her mother Mel Jones, voice actor Teri Hatcher, and her father Charlie Jones, voice actor John Hodgman. Corallines' new life is shown to be less than wonderful as she meets her other tenants and is unable to realize her dream of gardening. Soon she discovers another world, which is much better in every way tailored specifically to Coraline based on information gathered by a spying Coraline doll carried by Coraline unknowingly. The other mother quickly turns villainess, as she is unable to get Coraline to do what she wants. With the help of the black cat, Coraline is able to escape the other mother and return home saving other children's souls who were less fortunate than she was.

8,"OK America, before you go blindly into an animated film with your young children, why don't you do a little research on what they are about to witness. A PG rating and stop-motion animated aesthetic do not always make a child-friendly adventure. Based upon the horror novella by acclaimed author Neil Gaiman, Henry Selick's Coraline is chockfull of heavy material, dark story threads, and bleak possibilities. For a guy like me, those things equal undivided success; for a child aged ten, those things equal nightmare filled evenings and parents writing angry letters to Focus Features for subjecting their children to lewd and horrific imagery. Well guess what parents? No one is to blame but you. I'm not saying keep all youngsters away, but do use some discretion on whether your son or daughter can handle the fantastical elements. This is very much Alice in Wonderland displayed in all its non-Disney possibilities. A cautionary tale on being careful what you wish for, our heroine must discover the difference between a world of people neglecting her and that of people doing all they can so that they may give her all she could ever want in the future. Life is not about getting it all right now, but instead a slow and steady climb built on love and trust, one whose benefits far outweigh the whirlwind romance that is never truly as it seems.",2009

I, for one did not have any nightmares of such. I think adults are completely overestimating what children can't handle. This was a fine movie. But maybe some of the elements weren't appropriate for younger viewers, like when Miss Spink and Forcible were performing in the other world. I may be different then other children because I can tolerate more scary elements. This was creepy and very original. I loved how twisted and strange it was. The movie was very good and I do suggest some of you actually allow yourselves to enjoy it without criticizing the moment you see something that seems inappropriate. I am a huge Neil Gaiman fan and trust me if I can endure The Lost Boys, I am pretty sure I can endure this. Parents, stop being overprotective and allow yourself to see the good things.",2010

Well as great as Up was, I have to disagree with the Academy, because Coraline was my favorite animated film of that year. This has to be one of the creepiest animated films I have ever seen. According to Doug Walker, Don Bluth had a saying that you can show kids as much dark stuff as you want as long as it all leads up to a happy ending.

I managed to catch this film in 3D, and I have to say that I admire the way that it's used here, as it doesn't rely on constant ""flying off of the screen and into your face"" moments. In fact, this is probably the most effective 3D movie I've ever seen, right up there with 2007's Beowulf (which, coincidentally, was also co-written by Neil Gaiman). That said, I'm sure that Coraline looks almost just as beautiful in 2D, as nearly all of the environments are just so incredibly lush, and the ones that aren't are bizarre and spooky.",2009

This show really grows on you and you cant help but say one of Kenny Powers' ridiculous quotes to someone even tho they have no idea what you are talking about and you laugh even harder.",2010
10,"The pilot episode was really funny. Danny McBride has that elusive, thoroughly Southern quality of brazenly aggressive, righteous pride that infuses every note. I have met pure examples of the archetype of ""Kenny Powers"" and while they may be rare, McBride captures the essence honestly and vigorously. The strong cast really elevates a show that could so easily and effortlessly slide into a grating farce. The women in Kenny's life are played with brilliantly understated dignity that is rendered so subtly, so carefully, it turbo-charges the comedy. Katy Mixon's reactions had me howling with laughter. Jennifer Irwin's southern housewife is spot-on with her quiet, tortured expressions that are amazing in their subtlety. Katy and Jennifer coil the show's mainspring so remarkably tight, it explodes when the raucously sexy Sylvia Jefferies and the hilarious Danny McBride pile on. John Hawkes has the hardest job in the cast. Hawkes plays Kenny's older brother Dustin and has to be both dignified and provide some degree of plausibility for Kenny's existence. There is a rich vein of comedy and heartfelt sincerity that lies underneath Kenny and Dustin's relationship and I hope the creators can navigate through it over time as deftly as Hawkes has managed his role in the pilot. The pilot episode seemed effortlessly directed by Jody Hill. Hill let the writing and the performances do the heavy lifting by placing a premium value on subtlety and nuance. For all Kenny's hurricane-like energy to dominate a scene, Hill balances that power by tempering it with the lightest touches from the rest of the cast. I look forward to future episodes, these folks have something indescribably great on their hands.",2009
9,"I don't know how I will feel about this show a year from now, but after having watched all six episodes several times over, I consider it to be one of my favorite series of all time. This was just exactly my sense of humor. In the vein of Bad Santa and its anti-hero Willie, Kenny Powers is an uncompromising mess of a character that seems to say and do the most amusing thing possible in every situation. Not since Owen Wilson broke out with ""Bottle Rocket"" has there been a performer who can make me laugh by doing so little--it's more about his delivery than the actual material. I am deliberately not discussing any details of the show in case someone wants to discover it for themselves, but if you enjoy either of the two movies I mentioned, or other profanity-laced HBO offerings, such as Entourage (with the equally foul-mouthed Ari Gold), then try some. I think it's worth noting that both Kenny Powers and Ari Gold are both the most quotable TV characters of the decade, and certainly my two favorites.",2009

The use of certain tracks over sequences that are often slow motion seems so perfect that it can create any tone the director wishes, whilst still keeping a underlying feeling of comedy. The non-diegetic sound comes to the forefront of your attention, creating so much more meaning than images simply could (although E & B would probably still be funny if watched on mute).",2010

9,"If you look at DSM IV criteria of narcissistic personality disorder Kenny Powers has it all: a grandiose sense of self-importance, fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, ideal love, believes that he is ""special"" and unique, requires excessive admiration, has a sense of entitlement, is interpersonally exploitative, is often envious of others, believes others are envious of him and definitely shows arrogant, haughty behaviors and attitudes. So, if you wonder what they mean when they say someone is a narcissist, here you have a fairly good example of what they have in mind. ",2011

In fact, contrary to what most people feel, I think the show actually gets better as it goes. Season 3 being my absolute favorite. I never thought a man simply wearing a wig and fake eyebrows (you'll see what I mean) could make me laugh so uncontrollably. If you're looking for brilliant writing (the cussing and insults are so perfectly crafted and thought out that it borders on art), great acting and perfectly cast characters, and honest to god brilliant cinematography, then watch this damn show. Danny McBride and Jody Hill both broke into comedy together, and they show here that they still have that initial passion and love for it.",2014
10,"This is one of those shows I didn't find out about until it was well underway. Eastbound and Down is a four season television series that ran on HBO. Major League baseball player, Kenny Powers, returns from major league baseball to his hometown, due to his awful temperament and a waning fast-ball. He then becomes a phys-ed teacher in a middle school and various other things. The series is about the trials a major league player, who's been demoted several times, faces while returning to a small-town mentality. The series is produced by Adam McKay and Will Ferrell. The temperament of Kenny Powers is inspired by former relief pitcher John Rocker and if you love baseball and small towns this series is a must-see. Now I must warn you the humour is completely crude but it's a good series nonetheless. - Asif Zamir",2013

I had no idea what I was in for going in but I was hooked after episode one. As loathsome and awful as Kenny Powers can be, he's human and has a strange way of worming his way into your heart. Stevie Janowski, Kenny's loyal sidekick, is one of the oddest and most peculiar characters you'll ever encounter. Awesome guest actors including Lily Tomlin, Don Johnson, Will Ferrel among others and all of them hilarious. Not a truly bad episode in the bunch. Highly recommended, for adults only.",2013
10,"In recent years, Disney's Pixar division, with their monopoly over animation, has churned out some of the biggest, funniest, most emotional material to hit theaters in the last ten years. By this point, the public knows their aggressive marketing campaign and knows it well. Adult humor and themes geared not only toward the kids, but the parent's as well. The mass appeal? Mom and dad can now take their eight year old to the local multiplex and fork over the steep price of admission without wasting it on a two hour long power nap. Last quarter's CGI constructed Pixar extravaganza ""Up"" captured audiences' hearts, imaginations and pocket books, raking in a less than modest 292 mil at the box office, making it one of the highest grossing animated films of all time. Along comes ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"", helmed by auteur Wes Anderson, a crack team at Twentieth-Century Fox (Yes, I said Fox) and Indian Paintbrush, one of Wes' collaborators on his predecessor ""The Darjeeling Limited"". If there's one thing that's detrimental to the Trump-like successes of the Disney powerhouse, it's a new found competitionlet the games begin.",2009

From the crude Christmas classics that are always on TV this time of year to the elegant masterpieces of Tim Burton, I never miss the chance to see classic animation at work. Needless to say, when I heard about Fantastic Mr. Fox, I was excited. A wonderful Rhold Dahl book, beautifully crafted animation, and an illustrious cast all in one package – this was exciting. I'm happy to say that my excitement was justified as Fantastic Mr. Fox is perhaps one of the best new movies I have seen this year. ",2009
9,"After reading the reviews on here I wasn't put off watching this film. As a huge fan of animation, as well as Wes Anderson films this film definitely did everything and more for me. There's so much going on in every scene, I found it even funnier than other Anderson films, and as usual I loved all the characters. Anderson manages to keep all the coin facial expressions/awkward silences between characters/quirky background stories that appear in all his films. It's a true work of brilliance! This film has a 'kids film' label on it, but it's not really for children in my opinion, I urge anyone who appreciates animation and is looking to watch something quirky and intelligent to go for this film. Don't be put off due to the hordes of children. Anderson films are best watched on the big screen, so go see it now before it finishes at our cinemas.",2009
8,"I'm pretty much the sucker for stop motion animation, so this naturally comes with that wee bit of bias, because I surely take my hats off to the filmmakers, especially the modelers and pretty much everyone who has to painstakingly move everything a little bit at a time, which for folks who are impatient (like myself), would already have driven one nuts.",2009

10,"I made a diorama in third grade of Fantastic Mr. Fox- a book which I loved fondly- and seeing this film brought me back to that, only better and bolder, but with the same handmade quality of someone awed by the world they read. It's also wildly funny and cheerfully light-and-heavy all at once. It brings director Wes Anderson's concerns as a filmmaker to light, as usual (dysfunctional family, idiosyncratic touches with the characters, absurd child-but-adult-like comedy), and in a setting that is a fantasy that anyone can attach to. Children will latch on to it because of its cute/creepy designs, and its raucous energy. Adults will eat it up because, like with Where the Wild Things Are, it brings us back to a time when we just want to have a fun time and do things, even if we might know or thing they're wrong, or maybe just to dance at very odd moments.",2009

The imagination and creativity in this film is truly impressive. I enjoyed every moment of this, and so will you.",2009
5,"What a conundrum. It's impossible for me to give this movie one star because in many ways, it's far from a bad movie. The merits which it does have, and there are some, definitely exclude it from that general category. It is, in all fairness, visually stunning, technically brilliant, flawlessly directed, and an all-around treat for the eyes. It's loaded with a great voice cast, wicked creativity, witty dialogue, and a lot of clever ideas. Yet nor can I give it ten stars either. Because in spite of all of this, its stunning visuals and innovative imagination does not mean that I enjoyed it. I didn't. One bit.",2010
10,"The beginning of the movie is simple, and a bit off putting, but if you sit back, and enjoy it as a work of art, and not a testament to real life, you will love it. It is beautifully and strangely directed by Wes Anderson and is meaningful not just for kids, but for adults too. The dynamite cast is another reason to watch this. This is relatively faithful to the book, and if you love Roald Dahl, you will love this movie. If you love Wes Anderson, you will love this movie. If you love animation, you will love this movie. If you love movies, you will love this movie. It is thought provoking, and fun for everybody, and I highly recommend it.",2014
5,"This film piqued my interest for two reasons -- the fact it was based on something by Roald Dahl (known for quirky stories) and the fact that Meryl Streep voiced one of the characters.

3,"The base for ""The Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is the beloved children's book by British iconic author Roald Dahl. As in the original the film focuses on life ordeals of Mr. Fox and his family. The premise for the story is Mr. Fox's stealing spree of chickens, ducks, turkeys and cider, which make him top of the most wanted list of despicable farmers Boggis, Bunce and Bean. Unlike in the original instead of a fox basically trying to cater and feed his family in this outing we have a typical dysfunctional Wes Anderson family, whose papa is addicted to stealing. Not to mention that his son is an irritating little bugger, whilst you also get a key new addition of kick-boxing super-athlete cousin Kristofferson . Oh! And did I mention that all the animals in the forest are Americans (which really makes the movie jar throughout, as the characters are cool hipster forest animals).

My beef(s) with this film are as follows 1. This movie bore little resemblance to the book apart from the names of the characters. 2. The whole thing was americanised. 3. This was sit-com material. 4. It was boring as hell. Things I liked were as few and far between I enjoyed the sound of Clooney's voice and Meryl's too, but they should have been given a much better script. I like quirky and have no real problems with creative adaptations but this was poor on almost every level. Wes Anderson should be ashamed of himself.",2010

4,"I was so frustrated watching this film. I went in with Dahl's whimsical Mr Fox, adored by his family and beautifully and loquaciously winning over his friends and neighbours, making him truly 'Fantastic' Mr Fox. Very shortly into the film I wondered why Wes Anderson had bothered to 'adapt' Fantastic Mr Fox when every character was so far removed from Dahl's characters, with Mr Fox's pubescent son resembling Gwyneth Paltrow's Tenenbaum character. Clooney's Mr Fox is far from fantastic, Streep's Mrs Fox is nothing like Dahl's Mrs Fox. Hearing such typically UK English prose adapted to Anderson's American 'Hey, Man's is grating for those familiar with Dahl's book. Similarly, the plot and settings loosely resembled Dahl's, with over half of the plot being Anderson's creation, and the bits that come from Dahl's book being changed so greatly. In Anderson's favour, this film had his typical rhythm, style, pace, and his depressed, staccatoed, little-explained characters, but then why take a story with such a different pace, with a completely style and with such different characters? Admittedly, Quentin Blake's illustrations live vividly in the mind of many Dahl readers and seem to so perfectly illustrate Dahl's dark, twisted and curious characters. However, it is not the animation that leaves alienates me from this film. The animation is generally well done, although, again, Anderson's overtones bear strongly on the animation, with each character bearing an Anderson 'twitch'.",2009

Possibly because its hard to market a one-off one hour play these days, evidence of the schedules suggesting that everything has to be open ended (more in the American style) in case it is a hot and can therefore be used to lure advertisers etc. Still, we all ought to be able to watch things when it suits us these days, so worth setting the recorder for.

10,I came to this series quite late and would love more episodes to be available online. I have recently caught up on a lot of this series of Drama's and love the interesting way that they are written to be clever complete stories contained in 45 minutes. The writing easily allows you to connect quickly with the characters. Each one a distinct story with a message for the viewer. I look forward to many more and particularly liked the episode with Lisa Riley. It demonstrates that sometimes simple stories are the best to depict human nature and the repercussions of decisions made. Keep them coming.

1,"I have to admit that I've only seen two episodes from series one of Moving On (described as BBC series consisting of standalone contemporary drama). The first was about a bully and the second about a woman who unwittingly gets involved with a drug dealer. Perhaps I've been unlucky and the rest are truly moving parables, timeless yet contemporary. However, in my opinion, this is underwhelming fodder for the daytime dazed. It's almost as though an inexperienced fifteen year old decided to create a number of one dimensional characters whilst leafing through the Littlewoods catalogue and later on, an over zealous parent decided to add some ""broadly credible"" circumstances for them to stumble woodenly through and then, p1ss1ng themselves with the opposite of creative excitement, entered the entire shambles in to a competition in a shopping arcade. What upsets me most are the pathetic female characters who, unable to stand up for themselves in any coherent or believable way, could easily be expected to suddenly pour themselves a bubble-bath whilst deep throating a Dairymilk and trying on all their shoes whilst chanting in monotone, ""That's men for you! That's men for you!"". Bl00dy sh1t! There are thousands of excellent screenwriters in Britain who could offer a short story for daytime TV with realistic dialogue and contemplative moral quandaries. There are thousands of incredible actors who could transport us to that fully relatable state of semi-detachment. Those two episodes made me hate my eyes.",2014

10,"This is quite frankly an astonishing film. One that fills your entire array of senses and sensitivities, and the praise from Argentine reviewers here is 100 percent justified. Ricardo Darín turns in another majestic performance as a Buenos Aires court employee who is fiercely affected by the rape and murder of a young girl in 1974, a tragedy that dominates his life. Overlapping this theme is the powerfully sensual but never physical relationship between Darín and his superior, the investigating judge played by the superb Soledad Villamil. The connection between the two is electric. It's a pity this film cannot easily transcend the language barrier, if it was an English-language film of the same quality it would already be hailed as a masterpiece. The blending of tragedy, love, violence and humour is brilliant, and the comedy dialogue fantastic. One scene where Ricardo Darín is balled out for having searched an old lady's house is priceless in terms of comic timing and delivery. A wonderful performance also from Guillermo Francella as the court clerk with a drinking problem, in fact the secondary acting is all first-class. The camera-work is impressive, especially the swoop down into the football stadium and the closeups, and the script is also superb. Argentina has nominated the film as its candidate for best foreign film at the Oscar's, it deserves to walk it.",2009
10,"Simply put, this is one of the finest films I've ever seen. I don't say that lightly, I don't exaggerate when it comes to talking about movies -- but everything about this one, from the acting to the writing, to the camera work, to the directorial decisions, is grade A. The story deals with deep matters, and it does so one step at a time, with a plot that moves steadily forward, gathering force, substance and intensity, not settling for easy answers or plot points, not cutting corners. The characters are complicated, interesting, believable, flawed, funny, tragic and deeply human.",2009
9,"Last night I went to watch this flick, and I must say that all in all, I ended up quite surprised because of it's impressive quality. Taking into account that I was already expecting superior film, indeed, it came out to be even more outstanding than I thought, mainly because of the rare combination of noir genre with very precise and measured funny moments and especially an incredibly faithful description of the Argentine system of justice and the characters that compose it. This last element is just perfect. The movie keeps your attention all the time -no decays at all- and the set design is also great, to such extent that it left me wondering what the tricks of the trade employed to achieve such similarity are. Foreign watchers might not fully understand some great details that are mainly local, but anyway they will surely enjoy the thrilling aspects of the film. It would be enough for them to say that almost all this locale's are just true, no matter how incredible they might look.",2009

A thriller, with lovable main characters, that makes you smile and think. A movie about a crime and a love.

Simply amazing. The acting is perfect. The pace is perfect. The ending couldn't be better (and we have seen so many great films that spoil it all at the end!).",2009

This is a great script, top-notch acting by everyone, partly thanks to the excellent casting. Superb cinematography. The film basically explores what ""passion"" is to the human being. A great passion (on various areas) is involved in almost all characters. You have suspense, a clever detective story, some surprising twists, etc. Darin has an ""aura"" (paraphrasing the the title of the film he worked in, ""The Aura"") that illuminates the whole screen.

By the way I watched this movie in It's original language. Subtitles were translated into English. I think by using ""Google Translate"" which sucks.

Those looking for an American style murder mystery or a boy-meets-girl, loses-girl, finds-girl romance may in fact have their eyes closed to some important possibilities.

In this case he directed and co-wrote the screenplay of The Secret in Their Eyes. Thus far it is the most successful movie in Argentina in the past thirty-five years and now in just few days after we saw it, we will find out if this Academy Award nominated movie for the Best Foreign Film will win an Oscar. It reminds us of the French movie, Tell No One, one of our all time favorites, as it is also a sophisticated detective story with an easy flowing but yet a complicated plot that keeps you thinking and guessing throughout the story. It is in Spanish, of course, with good subtitles. This movie is not only a mystery, crime movie but it is also a subtle romantic film which is has very good comedic moments. There is the use of a narrative technique that allows you to see the story through the imagination and the memory of the main character Benjamin Esposito played by well-known Argentine actor Ricardo Darin. There are skillfully done movements, which go back and forth in time as well as shifting the point of view, which on a few occasions took a few moments for us to orient ourselves. The acting, directing and photography were superb with great realism and therefore it surprised us to learn that the budget was only two million dollars. As required for all good movies of this genre, there is a strong ending, which will hold your interest and encourage further reflection.",2010

In the 70's, Benjamín has an unrequited love for his new-hired chief Irene that belongs to an upper-class. Benjamin is assigned to investigate the murder of Liliana Coloto (Carla Quevedo), a beautiful woman recently married with Ricardo Morales (Pablo Rago) that had been brutally raped and murdered. Benjamin and his alcoholic partner Pablo Sandoval (Guillermo Francella) feel touched with the grief of Ricardo and go further in their investigation. Benjamin observes that a man named Isidoro Gómez (Javier Godino) is staring Liliana in many pictures and he becomes the prime-suspect.

10,"El Secreto de sus Ojos is a great film. If you examine the filmography of the director, Jean Jose Campanella, you can see that all his years directing TV in Hollywood has taught him the craft of classic Hollywood style on a high level. But the movie is authentically Argentinian, both in style and in content. Ricardo Darin and Soledad Villamil are both deeply familiar actors in Argentina, and the romantic melodrama is quite typical, but the tautness of the suspense and the intelligent plot twists bring out the best in both actors, as well as an amazing supporting cast. And I loved the portrayal of politics. Without giving any more away, the scene in the elevator is one of the most effective portrayals of what fascism really feels like.",2010
10,"I can't add a lot to what has been written. The direction and cinematography aside (which is magnificent), this is an incredible psychological study, involving a group of the most complex of characters. Esposito finds himself in love with two people: the woman who was once his boss and because of inaction, left him heartbroken, and, secondly, a beautiful young rape/murder victim. Over a twenty-five year period, these forces never leave him. The rapist is his Moby Dick to his Captain Ahab. Since we don't see a lot of what happens in the intervening time, we must wonder how empty and fruitless his life has been until he has his epiphany. Mixed in all this are the politics of Argentina and the vengeance of a horrible man. Also, in the middle is the messed friend, an alcoholic, who can be a true talent, but is submerged in his problems, spending his time in bars. If we look to literature we might consider him the Sydney Carton of this film. When you see what happens to him, you will see why I choose this character as a reference.

I actually found it pretty comparable to ""My Wife's Boyfriend"", which Campanella also directed. I certainly recommend both films.

Obviously they thought exiting moments were more important than developing deeper characters and that's why this story that had great potential stayed so shallow. The dialog was always cheesy and none of the 'hero's' in this film really showed any real emotions nor did they give any of those speeches that give the audience goose bumps. Another thing that really bothered me was that so much was almost going wrong the whole time. Every second of the film had a 'close call' which made the film seem totally unrealistic. Examples are planes taking off just before the runway collapses or driving just fast enough to not get hit by an explosion. This can be very cool if it doesn't happen 100% of the time and I have never seen a movie abusing this way of creating excitement to this extent. So to sum up: If you feel like turning your brain off and watching special effects and big explosions with a very shallow storyline then this movie is for you. But if you feel like watching a movie with a bit of depth then go and see something else.",2009

1,"How is it possible to make such a terrible movie with such a big budget? It really annoys me that a lot of directors these days think it suffices to make an excellent trailer just so that people will come to the cinema. Or did this guy actually think he was making a master-peace? Sure the 'special-effects' were great, although after seeing Avatar it's obvious that even in that area it wasn't top of the line. The plot is so lame, predictable and the acting is terrible. I had no feeling with any of the main characters and was actually hoping they'd all die by the end of the movie. Those scenes in the car, I mean come on! Okay one jump over the cliff or through a building, but 3 or 4 times! Maybe kids will enjoy it..",2010
1,"2012 cost 260 million dollars and is 158 minutes long. At roughly 2 million dollars a minute, one might at least expect a thrill-a-second work of exciting entertainment, since one does not go to a Roland Emmerich movie expecting either art or deep meaning. Unfortunately, the many millions spent on this bloated, overblown ""B"" genre programmer could not guarantee the filmmakers a good script with a tight plot and interesting characters. Emmerich treats his own screenplay (co-written by Harold Klausner) with a level of seriousness customarily reserved for the Holocaust or biopics of figures like Jesus Christ or Mahatma Ghandi. There is no plot to speak of - Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) learns of the impending end of the world and has to rescue his offspring and ex-wife from danger. That's all that happens in the entire movie - for over 2.5 hours! By the 4th or 5th time we have seen Jackson and his gang escape death (whether by earthquake, plane crash, volcanic eruption, tsunami, etc., etc.) the whole thing has become so turgid and wearisome that one finds oneself rooting for the tsunami to kill them all just so the movie can end and one can go home. The thin plot might not be all that bad if the film were better-paced and more exciting, but Emmerich wants you to know that he is A Serious Auteur and that 2012 is an Important Film About Our Time, so every sequence keeps going WAY past its sell-by date. Watching this movie is like being hit in the head with a wooden plank multiple times - one is eventually stunned into abject submission. Emmerich does everything at least twice, and his respect for his own material seems to have convinced him that 2012 could not have been shorter by one second, when at least 45 minutes of useless sub-plots involving disposable minor characters as well as repetitive sequences of cities collapsing, flames covering the sky, 1500 meter waves drowning everything in sight and famous monuments crumbling into depthless chasms could and should have been left on the cutting-room floor. By the time Jackson saves the high-tech ark containing what's left of North American civilization (don't ask), apparently by channeling Shelley Winters' swim scene from The Poseidon Adventure, any sense of awe which the sight of huge waves washing over the Himalayas should generate in the audience has been replaced by a numb wish that the whole thing will be over soon and a prayer that one's brain death will only be temporary. After watching a whole lot of cities get destroyed again and again, one simply becomes mentally and visually exhausted by the whole bloated mess. Surprisingly strong performances from a thoroughly professional cast are wasted on tissue-thin characterizations - but believe me, these performers earned their money just from being able to say the bland, clichéd lines they are given with a straight face. Furthermore, despite the appearance of realism thanks to some technically flawless CGI, there is no blood or gore - there should be body parts raining down from the sky during the destruction of LA, but somehow no one seems to be on the streets. On the other hand, a lot of blood and gore might have reminded the movie audience that one is in fact watching a film about the extinction of literally billions of living things, but why should something so petty be more important than seeing whether John Cusack will get back together with his ex-wife and become a hero so his whiny, spoiled son will accept him? In any case, what does it say about contemporary society that a movie showing nothing less than the destruction of the entire world is rated ""PG-13""? As far as the ""science"" and ""facts"" behind this utterly ridiculous bit of piffle, the less said about that, the better. Of course, this piece of overblown trash will probably turn hundreds of millions for its makers and secure Emmerich's position as one of the top commercial directors of the day. At least if the world actually ends in 2012, all copies of 2012 will be destroyed.",2009

Maybe it's middle age (it's his first apocalypse since he turned 50). Or, maybe, it's because to a consummate destroyer of worlds (four doomsdays and counting), the true end of days is really just the final dreary step.

1,"I went into this with very low expectations for obvious reasons. I don't ask much from my disaster movies, but can you please show me something new? Please? The bombardment of clichés is overwhelming. There has to be a checklist somewhere in a Hollywood vault that displays the requirements for any disaster movie. The main protagonist has to be a divorced or separated dad whose life is in disarray but who is redeemed by the end of the movie. The step-dad must be devoid of all personality lest we start caring when he is inevitably killed off so the main character can move in on his ex. Any antagonist in the movie (who is this guy supposed to be anyway, the Secretary of Defense? I don't think it ever says, but I easily could have missed it, as I started zoning out) MUST be white and secondary protagonists (the President of the United States, the geologist, the doctor from India, the Tibetan man who helps the main characters and the President's daughter) must be minorities. Murphy's Law must apply and everything that could go wrong, does. However, since we know everything will turn out fine at the end anyway, there is no tension whatsoever. Finally, there should have been a disclaimer at the beginning that read: ""WARNING: In the following movie, product placements will attack your senses at every opportunity"". I guess when your budget is a quarter of a million dollars, you'll take any money you can get. I get that this is a movie, but some plausibility would be nice. Is Jackson Curtis secretly Aquaman?

1,"It is no small accomplishment to film a movie about the end of the world and make absolutely all of it very, very boring. Hats off to '2012'. Like some others, I rented this for sheer kicks. I got kicked, all right. From John Cusack - apparently Hollywood's poster boy for divorced, cynical writers who come through at the end - desperately trying to stay afloat in absolutely horrific dialogue (yes, his ex takes a moment as the world is ripping apart to remind him that he had 'blocked' his family), to Woody Harrelson's awful acting as the crackpot who knows the truth - and you just know he's howling with glee at having been paid a lot of money to do this junk - to pseudo-scientific rationales that choose to utterly ignore how the erupting of Yellowstone alone would plunge the Earth into years of darkness, to insulting racial stereotypes like you would not believe, to the ultimate infuriation of the leads embracing in meaningful relationship babble as seconds remain to fix the ark before everybody's doomed...it's all one extravagant and unwatchable mess.

It also has characters you don't really care about, if they die no one gives a crap. You don't even care about a dog in the movie. And who's idea was it to cast John Cusack? He was just terrible, everyone was just god awful in this movie. I had to watch in my Earth Science class last year over Armageddon. I would have rather watched Armageddon over this piece of crap.

But what really made me angry was the way the movie constantly insulted the audiences intelligence, eg. the endless near miss escapes where an old camper van can outrun a superheated cloud of ash and fireballs, a light aircraft can be engulfed by the same ash cloud and emerge unscathed, and of course the biggest and heaviest cargo plane in the world, loaded with 10 or so cars, can dive nose down into a hole at the end of the runway and still have enough lift to safely make it out, weaving between collapsing buildings like it was a bird.

To show that the legal system was unable to hinder him murdering people though being in custody AND had to set him free, because the DA and the judge broke the law to stop his series of murder thus ignoring his civil rights which would ultimately lead to dismissing all charges. The supposed plot to blow up the mayor and homeland security does not at all fit neither the character of Shelton nor the plot of the movie. Good movie screwed up completely in the last 15 minutes.

Clyde now ranks as on of my favorite characters ever. Now for the bad part. Jamie Foxx was horrible!!!!!!! I don't understand why directors and casting directors like to put bad actors against good actors. It seems to be an ever increasing trend in Hollywood. we saw it in ""the Italian job"" and we see it here. Jamie's acting was the worst I had seen in a long time. He showed no emotion at all. I would have liked to see a better actor cast but hey who am I? Also, listen up producers, the ending was ridiculous!!!! I mean come on. you build this character up only for a huge let down. That was by far one of the most irresponsible endings to a movie I have ever had the misfortune to see. When I tell people to see this I am recommending that they leave at a specific point about 15min before it's over and imagine your own ending because no matter what it will be better. Endings like that is the reason people watch independent films. This movie could have been an all time classic but for Jamie Foxx and the writer's lazy ending. It still may because I loved most of it. I pray someday producers figure out that we want something a little different and allow things to end the right way, the responsible way for their viewers.",2009
3,"OK so the premise of the ending is that, although the justice system is flawed, you cant just kill people to get your own justice and you are becoming what you hate and it will lead to your demise. So how does the director explain then that Foxx, the supposed good guy of the film, instead of using the justice system he represents to hold Butler accountable for his crimes, does instead just murder him in his cell. How does that make him any different to Butler. But Foxx murdering someone is apparently OK and he goes on to have a happy life watching his daughter play the cello. Murdering someone because they are murdering because of the murder of other people. Irony anyone.",2009

And Gerard Butler's character is supposed to be a super genius that outsmarts the most wanted terrorists, only to get outsmarted by a a spoiled rich lawyer who neglects his family.

At some point the movie makes the conversion where Gerard Butler goes from good guy to bad, and Jamie Fox becomes the good guy... I definitely did not follow. Why would I want to see a movie where the morally bankrupt lawyer wins!? LOL that's so terrible it's worse than laughable; it's worth about 5 mins of laughing and 15 mins of ranting outside the theater after the movie ends (which I did btw). In a situation where the protagonists' wife and 10-year old daughter are raped and murdered, the entire system deserves to be brought down. If I go to a movie where the system screws over the little guy and that little guy comes back to dish out real justice, I absolutely, positively DO NOT want to see the ""system"" win in the end, regardless of any Hollywood-ed glossed over change of heart the corrupt lawyer might happen to have.

Although the entire movie required suspension of disbelief, the ending was unfulfilling and implausible given the rest of the movie. It was as if the villain was actually Rice with his corruptness, while Shelton was indeed a law-abiding citizen driven to vengeance by the corruptness of Rice and the justice system. The real disjustice was the ending of this movie. I kept expecting the intelligence shown by Shelton throughout the movie to come to a head in the ending. I was highly disappointed by the anti-climatic ending. Stop the movie about 10 before the end and create your own ending; it will be better than what was on-screen.",2009

Unfortunately, after a successful killing spree against numerous members of the justice department from within his jail cell in solitary confinement, the star of the show, who is smart enough to arrange all of this, is somehow clumsy enough to allow his methods, nightly exit route from prison and piece de resistance (napalm bomb) to be discovered, leading to an about face by the chief prosecutor (now DA) who suddenly goes from object of hatred to vilified victim/come star as the previous randomly dumped star of the show napalms himself by accident. What a shame, what a confusing and ridiculous ending.

The problem, though, became very apparent as Citizen was nearing the last half hour. How do you explain it all. It's almost as if 3/4 of this movie was made, and then the makers remembered that they had to end this thing. And so they did. Only what we were given, the resolution to it all, was so anticlimactic (and for that matter, unbelievable) that it was almost laughable. I think it would have been better to leave it a mystery then to give the audience what was one of the most outlandish conclusions to a film I've seen in a long time. That's not to say that what came before this was a masterpiece. The dialogue was, at times decent, and at other times sub-par. The characters were never developed enough for people to really care about what happened to them, and the editing left something to be desired. But even with all of that I was still interested. I still wanted to see where all of this was going, and how all of this was happening. I shouldn't have been so eager. They say that sometimes, the unknown is much more intriguing than the known.

The ""scary"" scenes aren't scary; there is a lot of over the top gore. Essentially, this movie mocks teen horror flicks.

And then you find out she's got a big sister, who's really hot because your friend shows you a picture and your friend says she's gonna introduce you to the sister. So it's all good and you get pumped about the meeting but then when you're at the Bar None and you meet the older sister, you find out she's nowhere near as cool as the younger sister and you're disappointed because you thought there'd be some family resemblance not in looks but in the way they act but there just isn't, to the point it's harder to get drunk than usually because you're not having the fun you thought you would.",2009
8,"Enjoyable movie, though not fits right in horror genre, but it doesn't even trying that, nor comedy since is more, witty, funny and smart than hilarious and in the end is more clever and emotional than usual. Unfortunately all that didn't leave much space for scares, tension, anticipation which are basis for the genre in which after all this movie belongs. Trying to much to redefine the genre and approach at all, the director and screenwriter has for the most of it succeeded, but still the before mentioned flaws are leaving a hole on the final product, a small one but it is there.",2010
7,"Jennifer's body is a movie I actually had a lot of fun with, and I'll tell you why. It's a great throwback to the cheesy, yet fun 80's horror films, only with a bigger budget. I really felt like I was back in the 80's, and it made me reminisce a lot, heck even the characters feel 80'ish. All I have heard was how terrible this was, but those are probably the people who appreciate the never-ending pg rated crap, that comes out like crazy now a days. I thought it was a nice touch how Needy was telling the story from a Mental institution at the start, it set the perfect tone for the movie. Megan Fox is actually pretty arresting as Jennifer, not only because of her looks, but she shocked the heck out of me with her devilishly funny performance. The gore level is pretty decent, and Horror fans will be pretty pleased with that. The character development, was also better than usual for this sort of thing. Amanda Seyfreid's geeky, yet undeniably dynamic performance often made many highlights for the movie. Jennifer's body is silly fun, and never tries to be anything more, I really don't understand the hate for this movie.",2010
3,"Am I the only one that thinks Diablo Cody is a terrible writer? Though I did enjoy it, Juno was extremely overrated, and this piece of crap cements it for me. I hate Diablo Cody as a writer. Her contrivance and witty attempt at being hip and relevant just doesn't fly. I will give her credit for trying to look at dialog from left of center, but people don't talk like that....well except maybe Diablo Cody. But I didn't go to see a movie full of Diablo Cody's, I went to see a movie with moving characters you care for. If they die, I should care, which I didn't. and the ""twist"" ending made the Happening look like Citizen Cane, and I'm talking in this day and age where my future unborn children already know what rosebud is. It is still more of a reveal than this movie. It was a shame because there were same great actors in this movie and Megan Fox. Though I will give both Cody and Fox credit, because she actually fit the dialog well, but it doesn't make me hate it less. I found myself bored, and bored in a horror movie is unacceptable. I've seen some awful horror movies too, but never have I been this bored. I gave this movie 3 stars, one for Amanda Seifried, one for the (in my opinion) under appreciated Kyle Gallner, and one for the few interesting shots throughout the movie. Notice NONE for Diablo Cody!",2009
5,"Winning an Oscar for a first film is a perilous position for a screenwriter to be in, for with adulation comes high expectation, and with high expectation comes hype that is almost always self-defeating. Such is the case with ""Jennifer's Body,"" the sophomore script from Diablo (""Juno"") Cody, which takes an uncomfortable union of concept, content, and direction (by Karyn Kusama), and transforms it into a film I really WANTED to like, but in the end couldn't. Marketed as a hip, self-aware horror flick, it never delivers much beyond the norm of the genre (it follows firmly in the tradition of Kevin Williamson, who gave us ""Scream"" and ""The Faculty"" over a decade ago), and passages of heartfelt emotion are shortchanged for ridiculous horror segues (an indie band sacrifices a virgin to make a pact with the Devil, for instance) and Cody's own contrived linguistic quirks. The quirks worked for ""Juno,"" which told a dramatic story populated by fully realized characters and peppered with moments of bittersweet humor. ""Jennifer's Body"" almost succeeds based on the strength of its central duo: the titular cheerleader (Megan Fox) and her bespectacled, dorky BFF, Needy (Amanda Seyfried), who undergo serious issues when Jennifer becomes a literal man-eater; the bond between them is so palpable and effective that it almost saves the film when it goes off into the realm of bloodshed and digital trickery. If Cody's script can't find a balance between the horror, the humor, and the pathos, director Kusama steers the film even more erratically, resulting in a tone that remains unsettled until the very end. Ultimately, ""Jennifer's Body"" has its share of visually arresting moments and fine performances (particularly Seyfried's), but it has much less to offer than its obvious (and far superior) influences: Jacques Tourneur's (and Paul Schrader's) ""Cat People"" and the ""Ginger Snaps"" trilogy (which took the metaphorical monstrosity of puberty and its own clever dialog into much more exciting territory).",2009
5,"Predictably, the only reason I went to see Jennifer's Body was because of Megan Fox. Not because I think she's a great actress - she's done nothing to prove this - but because... well, it's Megan Fox. The only reason why she was ""discovered"" by Michael Bay and put in the Transformers movies was because she's hot, and that's precisely the only reason why she was given her first starring role with Jennifer's Body. Because, really, although she isn't particularly awful - I've seen worst performances in porn movies - her performing skills don't deserve as much attention as she has been receiving. Yes, that basically means she doesn't give a very good performance in Jennifer's Body. And to be honest, that's something of a disappointment - before watching the movie, I had a little bit of hope that the reason why Fox had given such horrible performances in the Transformers movies was Michael Bay's inability to direct actors. After watching this movie, though, I concluded that Fox is nothing more than eye candy - whether she's directed by Bay or Martin Scorsese, she'll always give a bad performance.",2009

It's funny, it has gore, Jennifer Check has to be one of the most epic characters I've ever seen and I'll never understand the hate for it, sure it has some bad, corny moments but everything else makes up for it. I have to say when Amanda Seyfried said she regretted doing one movie in her entire career, this one came the first to mind but only because I know of how unfairly hated it is, Amanda and Megan should be proud of this movie in my opinion, it gave Megan one of her most iconic roles (if this isn't it) and Amanda probably just because she got to make out with Megan Fox. I can't explain how much I don't get the hate for this amazing movie.",2015

Did writer Diablo Cody intend Jennifer's Body to be a straight-up horror, a dark comedy, a teen drama, a pro-feminist tale, an allegory, or even perhaps, a mixture of all of these? Whatever the intention, it doesn't really work.",2009
8,"This being a movie written by Diablo Cody set the bars quite high, and I was surprised how good it was, especially since I'd seen the low average here at IMDb. First of all, this review contains SPOILERS! This is a horror comedy with a razor sharp script and beautiful music video footage. A lot of the latter part of the movie feels kind of like a Rammstein video - in a good way. But the thing that I like best with this movie is that it doesn't pretend to be something it isn't. It doesn't take itself too serious. I suppose that you could compare it to 'The Faculty', although I'd say this one's a lot better. But the movie that I think is most appropriate to compare it to is the eighties movie 'Heathers'. And I believe that it's a fair comparison and that 'Jennifer's Body' is just as good. So if you like 'Heathers' you should definitely see this. If not, you might as well give it a miss.",2010

7,"First of all, lets get one thing out of the way: JB is not a bad movie. Its a movie that will keep you glued to your seat for 100 minutes and make you flinch after every 15. The first 10 mins are beautifully shot not to mention the narration by the main character is pretty good too. The storyline is intriguing even though you decipher the final twist of the movie you are not 100% certain that you are right about it and most of you were not even though you won't admit it now. The horror scenes are extremely unnerving ((spoiler alert!)) especially the scene right after Jennifer's possession when she comes back to needy's home. The love scenes (rather lust scenes :)) depict the state of mind of teenagers very truthfully. Most people say ""that was just stupid"", ""why would he walk their?"" hormones is the answer. Boys would do anything for tail and thats what this film shows. You wouldn't go into a dark street for a pack of cigarettes but you would go running if a girl like Miss Fox is waiting on the other end (2nd Guy). The best thing about this movie is that it has a satisfying end when nowadays capitalist studios make some room for a sequel in the movie's climax when the villain rises again etc ( like ""Homecoming""). I am sure you won't be hearing about ""Jennifer's Body: The Black Diamond Curse"". The last scene when ((spoiler alert!)) Jennifer dies is extremely well shot and written (as in screenplay, the actual dialogs are OK). You will leave the theater content with the movie's end. Some problems are their that didn't let this movie turn into a great one. For example the dialog at some point is simply vague like Megan saying ""my tit"" at the end of the movie. They could have come up with a better deeper line in accordance with the scene. Also, even though a minor detail, the exchange student is shown as a Sikh whereas his name was ""Ahmed"" which is a Muslim name. A bit research would have taken this movie even more higher. Megan fox shows (unexpectedly for me) the depth of her acting as she makes you believe that she is a evil teenager. Amanda's acting is flawless as her role is affected less by the vague lines I mentioned earlier. I really liked the movie even though I heard bad things about it from friends. 100% recommended to any Miss Fox fan (& non-fan) and horror/suspense genre fanatics. Peace. Out.",2009
1,"After"" Juno"", Cody could have worked with any studio, any producer, any stars in Hollywood. So what does she do? She took her new-won power and created a cheesy, soft porn, mildly scary, totally worthless sexcapade aimed at white male teenagers. What a waste of talent. It's totally predictable (read her biography), and probably signals her rapid decline on the heels of her rapid ascent. The acting, the art direction, the dialog, the music, none of it works. It's easy to mock it as the HBO version of Buffy the Vampire etc., but that would be an insult to both HBO and Buffy. One can only assume Cody has no moral compass, that she sees writing movies akin to how copywriters write commercials. It's just a job, who cares what you're selling, it's all about the money. It's too bad she's gone down this road. Has she driven too far to turn back?",2009

The shaky parts are supposedly documentary clips telling the story of Wikus, the protagonist. But rather than add to the feel of it, the shakiness is just nauseating. They just over did it.

New ghettos, new forms of life and we have to learn to live with it or, or what? Neill Blomkamp, the 30 year old director, is someone who's exploded into the film scene and I'm sure he'll stay for a long time to come. A commercial director with a refined artistic mind. Accessible without being condescending a real find and who found him? Peter Jackson. A man that I suspect is creating a Hollywood overseas, a Hollywood for the thinking man.

2,"I had heard enough about this South African film to know that it was an allegory about the Apartheid period. And I'm a huge fan of intelligent sci-fi. What could go wrong? Everything. Can I have those two hours back? The first 20 minutes was interesting. The lead character is portrayed as a passive-aggressive racist who is a part of the problem, smooths over police violence in front of the press, and fails utterly to comprehend the situation around him. In short, he's marked for death. He's the red-shirted security guy beaming down with Kirk and you just know his minutes are numbered. But when something bad does happen to him the movie's logic goes off the rails and melts into a steaming pile of a cheap Chuck Norris action flick where rifles blaze, grenades explode, and there's no motive to any of it other than just to blow sh*t up for the twelve year old kids in the audience.",2009

10,"I just saw an advance screening for DISTRICT 9 with some others from my book club. Half of the 300 people attending were still buzzing about this film-goers' delight when the lights came up after closing credits. Some said its setting in South Africa's Soweto slums reminded them of CITY OF GOD. Others said its mockumentary style was reminiscent of CLOVERFIELD. Someone said it ranks up there with THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL (1951, of course) and ALIEN for sci-fi originality. Another fan said it reminded her of IMPOSTOR ""on steroids"" (I looked this up, and it's an obscure 2001 flick starring Gary Sinise, in a moral dilemma similar to Wikus' in DISTRICT 9). At any rate, normally I don't award low-budget ($5 million) remakes of shorts with a ""10"" out of 10 rating, but I found DISTRICT 9 to be enough of an eye-opener to deserve a ""10,"" despite being more flawed than any other top-ranking movie I can think of at the moment. The key to enjoying DISTRICT 9 is to sit back, and not to nit-pick. It may lack the stars and special effects bazillions of TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN or STAR TREK: THE FUTURE BEGINS, but DISTRICT 9 will give most people more food for thought than either of those two earlier releases of this summer.",2009

I hated Star Trek for disappointing me with being more childish (and thereby being so seriously) than Star Wars. Now I love District 9 for surprising me with a good idea and a subversive view. SciFi is rare, because it's expensive. Good SciFi is one of the rarest things, because the massive amounts of money spent must flow back to the investors with profit, and they think, that only mainstream and infantile movies work in that way.

I fought with myself through the movie, trying to decide what emotions to feel--or what emotions were ""right"" to feel. This movie messes with you in a very powerful way.

As it turns out, if you liked the book very much and worried about how its uber-bleak and incredibly dark and (especially) gray landscapes would appear, it provides that perfectly.

Here is a picture that in it's own discreteness captures the realism of a holocaust horror, combining the absolute worst possible future with the most profoundly beautiful human characteristics that keep the main characters persevering. Not only does the story accurately exhibit the polar opposite aspects of a post apocalyptic existence, but the cinematography used during the flashbacks of a life full of color and hope many take for granted, is excellently positioned with the dark, dismal, and often terrifying reality that is the Road.

8,"""It's not as good as the book."" seems to be one of the most common sentences in discussions about movies. I have certainly uttered it many times. I try to judge a film on it's own merits as a separate art form, but cannot help the comparison, especially when elements that I love in a book are sacrificed in the translation to the screen (especially if I felt the changes were made in service of some 2 hour ""time limit""). I can only remember one time that I thought a movie improved on a book (The Godfather and the Godfather Part 2.) There are certainly many times I felt that a mediocre book served as the basis for a mediocre movie (The DaVinci Code). Cormac McCarthy's works have generally translated well to the screen, especially No Country for Old Men. The Road was one of the most wonderful books that I can remember - to create a sense of hope against an overwhelmingly dismal post-apocalyptic backdrop is no small feat. As I read it I found myself sympathizing with the fears and frustrations for the man and, at the same time, completely drawn into the innocence and wisdom of the boy. I could not put the book down - I had to know the ending of this story.",2009

If it is between putting a bullet into the head of your child rather than allow him to be eaten, one must come to grips with mortality and pride.

In the novel, one of the most poignant lines comes from the boy as he tries to share the can with the man, who initially refuses to partake. The boy says something along the lines of 'It's because I won't ever get to drink another one, isn't it?'

Even humans will do. Our two protagonists are making their way to the coast, why? No one knows or seems to care to tell the audience. Dad and the annoying little brat, who looks far too healthy to pass for an undernourished lad, sleep in abandoned cars and houses while they try to steer clear from fellow human survivors.

Viggo Mortenson as the Father and Kodi Smit-McPhee as the Son who are forced into survival in a Earth now destroyed by man's greed and global warming has killed most life except for as it is explained in the film two different types of peoples....The good people and the bad ones which do nothing but resort to cannibalism. After we see flash backs of the Mother telling the father that he needs to see to it that he gets their son to the sea in the South because she has no more of a desire to go on living, and in a very moving scene we see The Father pleading with her to just spend one more night with him before she walks off and dies. She does not and walks off into the darkness. The rest of the film has the Father and Son fighting their way through burned out cities and across a barren landscape in which it rains almost every day. They fight for survival from what appears to be red-necks who eat human flesh and keep warm humans locked up in basements to be eaten later. The Father Manages to escape death several times and save his son with nothing more than his wits and a pistol with only 2 rounds in which only 1 is ever used.",2010
1,"When my husband and I went to see this movie, we chose it purely because a) it wasn't one of the ridiculous movies already out, and b) it got a good rating on Rotten Tomatoes. At the snack counter, a poster proclaimed, ""One of the most uplifting and optimistic movies of the year!""",2009
1,"***Spoilers up in here****** This movie should have only been 2 minutes long; it should have started and ended with the whole family blowing each other's brains out. I consider myself a deep thinker and love a good post-apocalyptic movie so I was excited to see this but I was left in awe with the utter bleak pointlessness of this one. There is no real plot or storyline, unlikeable, undeveloped characters and the story left nothing to ponder except: if you were starving and the world was essentially just ""over"" would you start munching on the other survivors or kill yourself? I would just go ahead and off myself but I can assure you I would not have done it the way Ms. Theron did (wandering in the dark to death.)",2010

The father is so well that you wont be forgetting him long after you watch this movie.

8,"This film adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's 2006 novel THE ROAD opened to rave reviews . Despite these reviews from professional critics it only received a limited release and fared very poorly . The brief glimpses I'd seen from via clips and trailers had cinematography that leapt out and grabbed me and I was puzzled as to why it didn't do better at both the box office and award ceremonies . After seeing the film in full it's perhaps understandable why THE ROAD didn't do better . Australian director John Hillcoat has crafted an impressive but utterly bleak and depressing movie where mankind is headed for extinction and considering a large amount of survivors have resorted to cannibalism one can't help thinking the human race won't be missed . Make no mistake this isn't the comic book capers of MAD MAX , nor is it feelgood post apocalypse cinema along the lines of the more successful THE BOOK OF ELI , or the wish fulfillment cosy catastrophe 1970s BBC drama SURVIVORS . This is nihilistic speculative fiction that American cinema ignores similar in tone to John Christopher ",2013
9,"... not the movie, but the number of self-professed Holmes aficionados who apparently have no knowledge of Holmes. For the record, Holmes was a miserable, irresponsible drug addict who did indeed sleep on the floor, insult his best friend, experiment on his dog, and never ever wore a deerstalker's cap (at least, not until television was invented). He was a brawler who practiced martial arts and was as likely to slum around in the filthiest of rags as he was a suit.",2009
10,"Nearly hundreds of actors have played Sherlock Holmes and his sidekick Dr. Watson, and it may seem rash to call Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law the best Holmes-and-Watson-duo so far. But I've been a Sherlock Holmes fan my whole life, and most of the portrayals I've seen of the character only focus on an aspect or two of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's character. In Guy Ritchie's film, as in Doyle's ""canon"", Sherlock Holmes is an avid boxer, a martial artist, a dabbler in many sciences, and a master of disguise. Most importantly, he's an expert in logic and deduction. He playfully torments his housekeeper Ms. Hudson (Geraldine James) and shares an antagonistic but symbiotic relationship with police Inspector Lestrade (Eddie Marsan).",2009

8,"Do Guy Ritchie and Sherlock Holmes fit? Why, it's elementary my dear movie fan. This is one of the most entertaining thrillers of the year and the fantastic Downey Jr. and Law are a big part of the reason why. They take top honors as the years best bro-mance, arguing like an old married couple while deep down knowing that they'd be lost without each other. Downey is Holmes and Law is sidekick Dr. Watson, embroiled in a plot where the black-magic-practicing Lord Blackwood (a perfectly grave and menacing Mark Strong) has risen from the dead after being sentenced to hang. Rachel McAdams also shows up as Irene Adler, the only criminal who has ever gotten the best of Holmes.",2009
4,"This movie is entertaining and the big budget showed in the costumes, set decorations, the CGI, etc. all this creating a 19th century atmosphere which was very pleasing to my eyes. The action sequences kept me mindlessly entertained, and the Sherlock Holmes frivolity and eccentricities was somewhat amusing. Now let's see what's bad about this: Firstly, the true Sherlock Holmes is not a fighter, he uses his mind to solve problems instead. He and Dr. Watson have reserved mutual respect for each other, especially Dr. Watson towards his enigmatic friend admiring all the while his amazing intellectual capabilities. I can't believe how bad their relationship is portrayed in the movie, like two stoned teenagers constantly fighting. The Sherlock Holmes character is the major problem with this production: although funny the why was he portrayed like a genius a la Mozart with unkempt hair and disorderly attire is beyond me. The action sequences I guess are a compulsory necessity in a big-budgeted production like this in order to attract teens and make more money for the studios. I blame the success of the Indiana Jones action sequences for this mishap. Just as unfitting for an archaeologist professor, it's also contrary to Sherlock Holmes' reason to use violence. But how else are we gonna have those compulsory big explosions? Lastly, the most important thing of all in a detective story, the case, rings closer to home to the original series, even though the explanations for the supposed supernatural elements at the end are themselves near impossible.",2010
1,"This movie was TERRIBLE! It wouldn't have been half as bad if they just didn't call it 'Sherlock Holmes' the way they portrayed him in this movie is NOTHING like the actual character of Sherlock Holmes. Holmes is not some buff, a-kicking, bad-a.. He is supposed to be a highly intelligent character and I didn't get that feeling from Downey Jr. AT ALL. I never pictured Sherlock Holmes to be a strong, tiny man & I think they just did completely horrible things with the characters. Story line and plot and all that was not bad at all definitely some good entertainment but NOT using Holmes & Watson as characters, that just completely ruined the movie because that is NOT what those characters are supposed to be like at all! Definitely going to avoid the new one coming out this year I was already disappointed enough in this one definitely know better than to waste my money this time. It makes me sick the way Hollywood takes normal proper characters and completely destroys them in films this was complete blasphemy I'll bet if the original creator of Sherlock Holmes was still alive today he would be very upset!",2011

When he is hung, he rises from the grave and promises to drastically change the world with himself as master. With the future of several countries at stake, it is up to Holmes to stop Blackwood. Downey Jr. disappears into the role like the character does with various disguises. He is completely believable as a detective whose deductive skills are so powerful that, without focus, mundane situations are overwhelming to his psyche. The film and role are his.",2009
4,"As with most of Hollywood ""blockbuster"" cinema these days, the film suffers from an inescapable, one-dimensionalism. It is all about style; the cinematography, costuming, digital sets and effects, etc. are all top notch. As well, the quippy dialogue betrays a certain shallow, slick stylism that the script suffers from in general. However, far from being a clever distillation of the best of Holmes and Watson, the film instead suffers throughout from a post-modernistic reductionism that flattens our heroes into effete, world-weary caricatures of their literary counterparts.",2011

In-between fights they try to solve a very difficult case about a bad guy (Lord Blackwood) that, as Count Dracula, has the power to get into the minds of the people and make them cause riots and protests everywhere in Victorian London. Although the bad guy’s ambitions are merely political, he also murders women as a hobby and that’s why he is captured by the two ninjas, then prosecuted and finally hanged.",2010
1,"I actually had high hopes for this movie. I went with a big crowd of people and while they planned to see Avatar I was going to see Sherlock Holmes. Unfortunately for them, Avatar was sold out so they all joined me in this train wreck of a movie. To be fair, there are about 10 minutes total that are kind of interesting. But the movie is 2 hours and 15 minutes long so there's the problem. There are so many plot holes that a mack truck could drive through and even with suspension of disbelief, it is truly a hodge podge of dreck with loud noises interspersed amongst the dreck to keep you awake. We are supposed to believe that Irene Adler is so strong as to heave a drugged and out-of-it Holmes from off the floor by the fireplace and onto a bed and then strip and handcuff him to the bed posts. They don't show you any of this because it would be laughably unbelievable. She must be super human to accomplish such a feat. There are other ridiculous stupidities that I thought perhaps were aimed at teens but the teens that were with me actually fell asleep because it was so boring. Every once in a while one of the sleeping teens would nod awake at a loud explosion. One such explosion completely engulfed the major characters yet in the next scene, not a burn mark is to be found. Apparently people in Holmes' day were made of asbestos. Don't waste your money. I like R.D.J. but this was a waste of time and money.",2010
9,"-----It came as a surprise when Guy Ritchie was chosen as the Director of 'Sherlock Holmes.' Known primarily for his work on indie crime films, such as 'Snatch' or last year's 'RocknRolla,' Ritchie had never taken on a mainstream franchise film, the likes of which 'Sherlock Holmes' promised to be. Thankfully, Ritchie was able to mesh the two genres on some level, with his trademark style of film-making ever present in his latest outing. The result is a film that will surely prove the most popular take on the character outside of Conan Doyle's original novels, and will also likely spawn a franchise.",2009

I didn't want to sit through ""Sherlock Holmes---Superhero!"" I wanted a plot that had at least some plausibility. It's hard to believe this was directed by an Englishman. It doesn't feel true to its period, or English society in general. I wanted a version of Victorian-Edwardian England I'd at least recognize. This concoction plays like Michael Bey mugging Arthur Conan Doyle. I will give Robert Downey Jr credit. He does bring some genuine panache to ole Sherlock. In fact, his performance makes it all bearable. The rest of a pretty good cast is wasted in a hyped-up video game version of Sherlock Holmes.",2011

Why do they continue to turn already entertaining stories into total mishmashes of roller coaster, smash-boom-bah adventures? Whether ""Dragnet,"" or ""Temple of Doom,"" or ""National Treasure,"" it seems that the Suits in Hollywood want every film to imitate the original Indiana Jones with a measure of Da Vinci Code on the side.",2010

I was pleased almost the whole way through this movie without caring much about character.

The time-slot didn't help (Friday night is usually the go-out-and-party-night) so most folks (like me) would TiVo this or DVR it for later viewing (which doesn't count to the networks, I guess). More's the pity. This show is really picking up steam and the story lines are getting better and better, especially now that the Echo, Sierra and Victor characters are being fleshed out more and given extremely interesting back stories. Eliza Dushku is a find as the tough, enigmatic protagonist of this series and since FOX isn't going to allow this cool show to go past two seasons, I sincerely hope they have the common sense to keep her on the payroll for other projects. Her chemistry with both good-guy Paul Ballard (Tahmoh Pennikett) and with brilliantly insane psycho nut-job Alpha (Alan Tudyk) is palpable and riveting. The casting of Olivia Williams as the ice queen in charge of the Dollhouse is spot on while Harry Lennix and Fran Kranz (as cool head security dude Langton and as genius programmer nerd Brink, respectively) add another dimension to the whole show. I'll continue watching this unique and entertaining series until it finally bows out a short time from now and hope that some other network may step in at the last minute and save it though that seems unlikely (again, pity). This is just a cool, pseudo sci-fi type show that probably had the misfortune of a cruddy time slot because everything else (the acting, writing, casting) was brilliant.

So along comes episode #8 - ""A Love Supreme."" If you know the works of John Coltrane, everything you need to know is in the title. ""A Love Supreme"" was Coltrane's masterwork.

This causes serious problems during the hostage exchange when it is revealed that one of the kidnappers is the same man that had kidnapped and raped her imprinted persona at a young age. What bothers me is that while the series is visually adept, I find myself not particularly caring about the outcome of the base person. This was briefly run through initially but lacks depth.

And then the not-so-obvious: why did this show get canceled? Think of it like a double-sided coin, the probability is 100%. Eliza Dushku, or Echo, the main protagonist and co-producer of Dollhouse in interview expressed her concerns about how this might have come to be. Advertising being one, but mostly it was the Friday night time slot she recalled as ""death"" that inevitably would drag the series down.",2010

Coming from the man who created Firefly, one of the most innovative, well written shows I've ever seen, I really hoped Dollhouse would capture some of that same ""magic"" that Firefly gave to it's viewers. Unfortunately, I think Joss Whedon must have used all of his good ideas on Firefly and all he has left is Buffy scraps...",2009

1,"Was it really necessary to make television worse by creating Dollhouse? Can Eliza Dushku play any other character than Faith? Which begs the question__why didn't she just do Faith instead of Echo on Dollhouse? I wouldn't be surprised at all if FOX pulls the series after the 2nd episode. Dollhouse will most definitely tank. There is no doubt about that in my mind. The story line is flat, pointless and boring. I almost fell asleep watching the pilot. The other actors on the show don't seem to know how to act. Plus, did anyone notice that the lab used to reprogram people like Echo looks a whole lot like Wolfram and Hart from Angel? Speaking of another similarity I noticed that Amy Ackers formerly Fred/Illyria of Angel guest starred on the show. Joss, really.

She can't seem to play anything but Faith (case in point, she dances in the pilot exactly like Faith). Fox was better off reviving Tru Calling. Why Joss Whedon didn't create Faith the Vampire Slayer is anyone's guess but I can say that Dollhouse will most likely flatline soon. The story took too long to get to the point. It didn't catch me in the first 10 minutes and it was downhill from there. The only good thing it had was a fight scene with Tahmoh Penikett where he's shirtless. That does not make for a good show.

You CARED about these people and their struggle, destiny and dignity. 'Dollhouse', as yet, hasn't displayed half the wit or hook of 'Firefly' or 'BTVS'. It's very hard for me to watch Echo and her protector interact knowing it's artificial and temporary. And I heard Olivia Williams' character icily declare ""It's complicated..."" in her proper diction twice too often in the first two episodes.

In general, it seems like Whedon's been moving further and further away from all the things he did well, and that each post-Buffy project has been increasingly watered-down and uninspired.

I think my mouth was hanging slightly open a few times from the brilliance on display. I was totally captivated from start to finish. Taken simply, it's a philosophical sci-fi film, but it's so much more than that. It's about choices, destinies, astrophysics, dreams and memories, just to name a few themes. Taken at its simplest, it's the jumbled recollections of the last mortal man, 118 years old, on Earth in 2092. The problem is that his memories are in total disorder and contradictory. In practice, it means that this is a very non-linear experience in terms of time and space, real and imaginary, showing you results of important choices either way. It doesn't focus on just 2 alternate lives either, things constantly branch out. You would think the film would be a mess, but it's surprisingly cohesive, gripping and even quite touching.

Like other surreal movies, Peter Jacksons ""The Lovely Bones"", and ""Synechdohe: New York"" ""Dr. Parnassus"", ""Micmacs""- these dreamlike and ""difficult"" films must be terribly expensive to produce and I ask myself how can the companies go through with these productions?

8,"As Nemo looks back (from age 118, yearningly, and forward from age 9, predictively, drawing on a 9-year-old's storybook-even-horror-story-based clichéd imaginings of adolescent/adult life and sci-fi future worlds), he sees his life's choices and their envisioned consequences pivotally stemming from one crucial choice at age 9, each path ""typed up"" as a draft of an alternate life. It's an existential tale of the power of choice to create the environments that reshape the persons who then choose from what life presents in their consequent environments, ad infinitum. It's a romantic tale in both the historic sense of quixotic, picaresque adventure multiply envisioned (including into distant time and space) and the modern sense of a quest for the idealized romance of heart and soul.",2014

The art can be disturbing, but the emotion it envokes might still be a good one, such as overcoming a personal fear.",2013

2,"In this very long, very beautifully photographed, labyrinthine semi-science fiction epic a very old person remembers his life in a very muddled way and we are presented with alternative stories of what (really?) happened. One gets the feeling from the very beginning of the movie that it wants to say something important. After more than two hours of tedious storytelling with a lot of repetitions, and alternative solutions of the life-story told, I have no idea what that important message is. I was so bored by this movie that I nearly panicked, and I wanted to leave the cinema, and the only reason I stayed was that my friend I was seeing it with wanted to see it through (though she was pretty bored too but she still had the hope of something meaningful at the end). The director and most people involved in this movie are obviously talented, but the problem is the manuscript, or rather, the idea as a whole. This overlong movie is a waste of time and money.",2010

A true tribute to the essence of any psychological thriller in modern cinema. I have watched this with my friends over and over again since it was released, and it is still flawless. My friends even tend to get into arguments about how many different various lives Nemo experiences, and at what point in time this splits. I love this movie with a burning passion, and it is an outrage that it is not on the top 250. All in all, it was well crafted, ambitious, and novel in many ways. Quite honestly, I hope they never make a sequel for fear of tarnishing their work of art. Bravo.",2015

6,"Considering that he's part of the dreaded ""MTV Generation"" of filmmakers, McG is surprisingly old-school when it comes to his framing: no jumpy Michael Bay antics or hypercutting Paul Greengrass mimicries. He is a far more organic director, letting the action sequences play out naturally. It's his execution that's at fault: the action itself. He piles explosions on top of other explosions and machines slamming into other machines, backed by the deafening cues of Danny Elfman's score, and I'm pretty sure Christian Bale had a yelling stipulation written into his contract. Everything's loud, intense, bombastic. You can't accuse McG of copying Jim Cameron's first two flicks — or even Jonathan Mostow's goofy third — but you're left wishing he'd perfected his own style before tackling such an ambitious project and producing, as a result, a frustratingly passable action-thriller.",2009
6,"The atmosphere that James Cameron and Stan Winston had created for the first 2 films in the franchise is what really hit me and still does to this day. I think that was the key component along with consistency and approach that gave the Terminator film it's unique style and attractiveness. It's metallic-blue overlay, infused with creepy whines of music and heart pounding edge of your seat suspense was what really created this secondary reality if not for only an hour long. It made us have a connection to these characters. A sense of believability in what was really going on. But it was those elements that were able to harness the inner workings of this dark dreamland. In essence the first two Terminators were projected nightmares in a sense, as if you were running and running, but no how fast you ran, the shadowy figure on your toes just keeps closing in. THAT is what made those films so captivating.",2009

1,This is one of the worst movies of all time. Not bad in a Plan Nine from Outerspace kind of way. No much worse. I have only once before ever felt so cheated and that was watching Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull last year. Cheated because of all the talent that could have made a GREAT movies and instead just cashed in big paychecks.,2009

9,"I just got back from seeing a midnight screening of the newest installment in The Terminator franchise, going into it with an open mind after witnessing the debacle that was T3 several years ago. Having said this, I honestly felt at though this movie did a fantastic job of translating the visions of the future that were set up in the original Terminator and T2 and fleshing out a feature-length film of them. While there indeed a few ""what in the hell were they thinking"" moments in the chase scenes, I felt that on the whole, the movie was a wonderful success, gripping me in a way that T3 never came close to. I truly hope prospective viewers give this film the shot that it rightly deserves and go into it with an open mind, and are able to just sit back and enjoy the ride...its a terrific one, trust me. Leaving the theater, I honestly felt as though this one gave the first two a run for their money as a film, as much as it pained me to say it. Truly a magnificent job breathing life into a series that could have very easy been done in once and for all with another terrible installment.",2009
1,"I really have a hard time believing that ANYONE enjoyed this movie. This movie could have been so great. It could have been amazing. It could have been the best Terminator yet. But it wasn't. It wasn't even close. The story was terrible. There wasn't enough action. This was supposed to be a war, but there were no full scale war scenes. Christian Bale was just as stiff as John Conner as he was as Batman (cheesy voice, no personality).",2009

The time line problems began with the very first sequel, directed by Cameron himself, and perpetuated with T3. why then, is everyone so freaked by time line errors in T4? Depending on which line to which you subscribe, T4 still deviates vastly from BOTH sequels and begins a new alternative reality spin all its own.",2009
4,"Hmm...Hmm...Hmm...ho hum dee. Terminator- 1984, we see a ground-breaking film with never before seen special effects and a story that was 10 years ahead of its time, Judgement Day- 1992, We see more groundbreaking film-making, a stellar cast, and one of the most iconic performances ever (GO ARNIE!!!), Rise of the Machines- 2003, not bad, especially considering that after T-2, that was it for Cameron, he was done, moving on to new things, new writers, new director, great rewritten history of Skynet reemerging after we all thought it was TERMINATED. And the return of Arnie. So...after about a year of hype (for myself especially, I am as the equivalent of a Trekkie in the Terminator universe), 2009, Terminator Salvation...Not groundbreaking, but with Christian Bale, Sam Worthington, Moon Bloodgood, McG, Seems like a damn good collection of actors and up and coming director right?? Well...here we go...",2009
1,"I was stunned at how bad this movie is. I don't think I've ever seen a performance where Bale mails it in but I don't blame him. The story is beyond remedial. There's no suspense, no emotion, no plot and no point. The only reason this movie seems to have for being is that it looks cool. If you like mindless action then I guess you'll like this but what made the first 2 films great was the story (let's not kid ourselves, that's what makes any film great). It had suspense, characters that you cared about and most of all INTELLIGENCE and HEART. This one is so freaking obvious it's astonishing.

3,"Yikes. This is definitely not the future my mother warned me about. This future is populated by cute kids, blood-free deaths, supermodels with perfect teeth and goofball terminators that shoot themselves in the foot. It is set in a sun-kissed Michael Bay desert landscape with high-tech military equipment and not the dirty sewers we saw in T1. Either Kyle Reese was laying it on real thick to get in Sarah Connor's pants, or McG et al were simply incapable of delivering the dark, post-apocalyptic future setting that they kept harping on about honoring before release.",2009

7,"TS is a film that will wow your eyes and ears. It will be a standard for demonstrating the latest high-end home theater systems for several years. Do not, however, go to this film to stimulate the imagination. The plot has many holes patched with barely-there plot devices. I'm reminded of the film Thank You For Smoking when the character Jeff Mengall spoke of Hollywood plot holes getting filled with lines like ""Thank God we invented the... you know, whatever device."" In previous Terminator films, you could always assume that sending anything back in time took a lot of energy and resources - that's why you could accept that there was only one Terminator instead of 2+ working together. In this film, we are made to believe that fighting Skynet is like out-maneuvering a herd of angry elephants with laser beams on their heads.",2009

A very mechanical performance, in some scenes it seemed he never lets go of his Batman character. The movie itself was entertaining for the most part, but lacked the suspense that the first two Terminator films had. A quality that James Cameron possesses as a director that has been lost in the last two films. The screenwriters for Salvation can't decide who the main character is and what the main plot of the film is. Hoping that Salvation would revive the Terminator franchise, I was left with a bad taste in my mouth once again. It was a loud action film with no substance. Better luck next time.",2009
1,"The machines have taken over the world, wiping out humanity and making them live like rats among the desolate wastelands littered with human skulls and the remains of a desperate struggle for survival. Right? Not exactly. Let me explain. That description of post-judgement day America was heavily featured in the first two movies and is what we all expected to find plastering the scenes of salvation, coupled with epic Saving Private Ryan style battle scenes as the resistance make a futile attempt at stopping the wrecking ball that is sky net. unfortunately it seems sky net is not the unstoppable force that we were led to believe, with the resistance camped out in daylight, in plane-sight for anybody who cares to look and the terminator army comprising of a few T-600s (clearly sky net hadn't realised how susceptible to bullets these models were) and some rejects from the transformers movie. So John Conner (Cristian 'Master of Accents'*pfffft* Bale) has discovered that Skynet is after Kyle Reese (his father who is younger than him but went to the past to stop his mother being wiped out so john could be born and ended up biffing her and getting her pregnant, but surely john had to be born before hand so maybe he would be born anyway - i digress) and John must pick between his life or mankind... Oh yeah, there's this guy Marcus, who's not a guy but a terminator (which we all knew cus of the trailers) but they don't know on screen until half way through the movie, but its got organs, oh wait... i don't care anymore. It all climaxes with the rather disappointing raid on sky net (which proves rather easy for our hero, ya know, considering its the Skynet HQ... HALLO!) and then a thought provoking aftermath - ""what truly separates man from the machines""... very poetic. It could have been, if the acting wasn't so undeniably ""aaaaaangrrryyy"", with Bale delivering his 'American-Jason Statham-angry' voice he used in his incarnation as batman. I swear there was even a scene where he was just shouting into the radio for no real reason... I understand why hes angry, roped into this heap of a mess, relying on its use of millions of dollars worth of FX and an orchestral underscore and nothing on narrative or character development or interaction that commits the viewer through emotion or engaging dialogue. IT Doesn't EVEN USE THE ACTUAL TERMINATOR THEME!!!! JUST THE DRUMS!!! The movie is rated PG-13 or 12A and rightly so, it features nothing cool what so ever, and very little violence to command a higher rating. There See a few small battle scenes, a lot of chasing (which, fair point, the terminator movies were all about the chase) and a massive chase scene with a giant robot, and some terminator bikes. These bikes have USB ports on them by the way... laughable isn't it. But wait, what the hell, considering the Terinators are unstoppable, i never seen one persons head get punched through, or stepped on, in fact, human deaths were very little, but with little action comes little deaths (except myself dying on the inside). You cant blame the studios for this, they are just trying to gain a new generation of people into the franchise... In case you hadn't guessed that was totally sarcastic, blame the studios. In focusing on a lower target audience they have eliminated the fans, messing up what could have potentially been the best movie ever. This movie could had easily been the epic return to form we all hoped for after the 'not so bad, but terrible compared to the rest of the series' Rise of the Machines. Instead were left bitter, twisted and a little dead inside that this diabolical mess was able to get made. The best bit is a brief fight with a CGI Arnie, which while the highlight of the film, shows just how unsatisfying and unoriginal the rest of the film is... Give the budget of this film to any fan of the originals and they could easily make a better film than this. And they could easily churn out a better script than this 10 page drinks coaster. OK, the effects are pretty good, just wish they were used to create something totally different from this. My advice is this, if your going to watch this, don't say i didn't warn you, this is grade A compost heap stuff. With the license they had and the money they used to make this, it could have been a spectacular, instead its a complete turkey of a film that without its high profile brand name would fall flat on its metal shiny arse and fade into the bargain bins... the only upside of this films release is that DVD prices for the original trilogy will plummet. bewsh 1/10 - watch T1 and T2 instead and bathe in nostalgia... avoid this at all costs because you will be disappointed, and empty.",2009

It promises lots of laughs and also a heartwarming message.There are movies aplenty, but very few remain etched in your memory and possess recall value. 3 idiots is one of those films. Indisputably and undeniably, this Aamir-Madhavan-Sharman outing is worth the price of the ticket and more.The film will set new records and has the merits to emerge one of the biggest hits of all times. The weekend business should be historic, the Week 1 business should be unparalleled, the lifetime gross should be amongst the biggest of all times. In short, 3 idiots has 'Blockbuster' written all over it.The story of 3 idiots has been told differently and most importantly, the story offers so many twists-n-turns that you just can't guess what would unfold next.There's so much happening in every scene and the screenplay is so gripping that you don't feel the need to look at the auditorium ceiling or at your watch at brief intervals. You aren't restless. 3 idiots demonstrates how strong film-making can enhance and elevate an already solid concept.An Aamir Khan film is nothing short of an event. The supremely talented actor acts in one film a year and no two films are ever identical in terms of plot line.To sum up, 3 idiots is commercial Hindi cinema at its best. The film has 'Hit' written all over it. Let me put it this way: Cancel whatever you're doing today and go watch 3 idiots instead.Director Rajkumar Hirani strikes a fine balance between humor and emotions. The comic portions are executed with panache, the drama is attention-grabbing and the emotional quotient is strong enough to turn you moist-eyed.

It is so much more than the usual college story of young guys getting drunk, flunking classes, and getting back at their superiors. It is an extremely well-made film about doing what you love and facing your fears. The acting is incredible by the ensemble cast. The script is funny and poignant at the same time.

Tim Roth is intense, engaging and brilliant... kind of a milder version of House - he's willing to stop at nothing to get to the truth, and doesn't feel the need to over-rationalize his choices. ",2009
10,So far I've only seen the pilot episode. I admit it. I've got a mad man-crush for this show.,2009
7,"Lie to me is a true rarity and gem among T.V. show's, it hasn't been done a million times over. Lie to me stars Tim Roth as Dr.Cal Lightman a doctor who specializes in body language and vocal patterns; together with his team of specially trained associates he helps the police and U.S. Government solve there toughest crimes. Lie to Me is a great show because it capitalizes on a whole new field of television, all you see on modern T.V. today is cop show's more cop show's and medical drama's. But this is refreshing it's much different then any show out there, yes it involves the police but in a small role there only around to keep things under control or to make arrest's. This show has a style and mind of it's own. It doesn't follow the extremely(and I mean that lightly) worn path of other show's that maybe similar or try to be like it. Take Castle for instance, it's a show about a murder mystery writer who helps' the police solve there case's; Now how many times has that been done? Lie to me is a completely original and highly entertaining show that I know that people will just love if they give it a chance.",2009
9,"A show which turned out to be a lot better than I though. There are lots of ""Cop-shows"" out there, although they are seldom something special. But this! This is a great show with great actors and a story that for once is different. Tim Roth does a really good job, so does the other less well-known actors.",2009
9,"Last night I watched the premiere of Lie to Me on Fox. I'd seen the previews for months, and when I saw that Tim Roth was coming to television, him being one of my favorite actors, I was both excited and dubious at the same time. Another of my favorite actors, Christian Slater, had made an awesome TV debut on My Own Worst Enemy. But the show had been canceled, and I honestly didn't want to see the same thing happen to as great an actor as Tim Roth.",2009
10,"Disregarding Reservoir Dogs, I think this has to be Roth's best work. Roth is extremely in touch with Dr. Lightman and you feel as if he truly enjoys playing this character. The show leaves you in total disbelief at points and instills a hunger for more and more episodes. I strongly suggest this show to anyone who is interested in an incredibly engaging and entertaining drama series as well as to anyone who is interested about Dr. Paul Ekman's work on facial expressions, and body languages as it relates to emotion. Solid television series. I look forward to the next few episodes. For anyone who has missed the first few episodes, the television series is now online at hulu.com. Highly recommend hulu as well.",2009

10,"I think this show is awesome and is now my favorite. I've never seen anything like it, really. I've watched it about a zillion times and can't wait till every new episode coming up. I was actually starting to get tired of all the re-runs and boring shows on T.V. I don't know if it's the science behind the lies or just the idea of it, but I've simply fallen in love with it. But I don't think it's just the lies that interest me, I'm also very in love with the actors and characters. Especially Tim Roth. Aka Dr. Cal Lightman. If there were words that could explain my interest and love for his work I'd use it, but as far as I know, there isn't. Even in the new ""Incredible Hulk"" I was struck by his talent.",2009

Thus he takes his partner and a new trainee with him to settle down at the police head-quarters.",2009

6,"This show burst out of the gates in the first season with some of the best television I had seen in a long time. This was a fantastic drama with great characters and a great concept. Unfortunately, the viewers for the pilot were over 12 million people, but had dropped by 4 million for the season finale. After that, the show started going off in new directions that did not mesh with the way the characters were being developed. One can only guess that Fox had a hand in this, pressuring the writers to bring in more viewers at all costs. AS you would expect, the results of that were not good, to say the least.",2011
7,"I have to say that my expectation were high. Partly, the show did fulfill them. The main character is very good actor and believable. Side characters fill their part adequately.",2010
10,"Lie to Me is certainly a one of a kind show, that brings together certain qualities of other well loved shows and wraps them up beautifully into one. The lead character, Dr.Lightman may remind you of ""House"", when it comes to his decision making and intelligence and the show's dynamics perhaps a little of ""Criminal Minds"" when it comes to profiling, and ""CSI"" as far as applying science in law enforcement...",2010
5,"Modestly entertaining, but as with so many contemporary crime shows there just has to be a distracting, hard-to-believe gimmick. Unlike House, to which a reviewer alluded, the protagonist has a ""special gift"" that makes it easy for him to solve crimes. Yes, I said easy and I mean it. Not that House is free of an unbelievable gimmick--that being his knowing everything about medicine and his infinite knowledge springs into action when it is time to solve the medical problem. However, in House, there is just a glimmer of credibility and truth that his genius intelligence and remarkable intuition can solve medical mysteries. In the 8 episodes of Lie to Me that I endured, I hoped for improvement. Nada improvement. Lie to Me's premise is simply a subset of the supernatural. Many people want to believe that there are special powers that enable some people to solve crimes and do other wonderful things. Boring show.",2011
4,I find this show rather weak. Roth's performance is somewhere between hyperactive and self-satisfied so for me there was no way to emote to his character. The story lines are rather confused and try to pack too much into a short period of time. All in all there seems to me a lack of focus in the writing and direction of the show. It's also difficult to understand what he actually does as he reads body language but we never really get a full explanation as to what he deduces from which gesture or facial expression. I'm not sure if maybe the format of a TV show is too short for such a complex topics or if it's really the overall issue of too much plot for too short a time.,2010
3,"""We're not magicians, we're scientists"" Oh, so 'Lie To Me' would like us to believe. Unfortunately for us, the new FOX show is undone partially by the silliness of its own premise. Considering the amount of lies told and believed, it is hard to imagine a person, let alone four, can tell a lie, within a few seconds and 100% of the time. Stories about a man who has an uncanny ability to tell lies from the truth defy reality in such a way that it alienates the viewer.",2009
9,"I know. Pie in the sky request. But for whatever it is worth, felt the premise of the program to be most excellent. Scintillating. Tim Roth's performance was spot on. Just enough quirky, just enough over the top, just enough. Supporting cast also excellent. ",2016
2,"Only made it through season 1. Maybe it is because I am capable of reading body language very well and great at deduction, many of the events and episodes were predictable from the moment they first introduced the plot and characters. ",2016
9,"Finally, a horror film about adults. Adults with complex issues and children that act like children and not hyper precocious sex models. The reason to see this film isn't to find out the over advertised "" Esther's secret"" of the film (a MAJOR misstep in marketing. Too many people now enter the film trying to figure out the ""secret"" before they normally would have been surprised), but rather to see a well-acted (extremely well acted by Vera F.)slow-building suspense story with excellent direction and cinematography. John Ottman's score also serves the film well, without becoming overpowering in signaling this is a ""creepy"" film. The actress who plays Esther shows a skill in performance that makes one think we may actually have another Jodie Foster to keep an eye on. This film works because we LIKE the characters (Rob Zombie please take note!) and fear for them and their survival. Dark Castle's best film, and it gives one hope that the horror/suspense genre still can be presented with intelligence and depth. Hollywood take note: we don't want a xerox of this film, but we do want more films that share this films strenghts: good script, likable real characters, excellent acting and nice, tension building direction.",2009
10,"Orphan REALLY surprised me. I expected some stupid pg-13 movie that somehow got an R rating. That was not the case. Let me tell you, Orphan is very disturbing at parts, and pretty gruesome. The movie overall is excellent, has some great acting, an amazing script, and excellent execution. The movie really has a lot of suspense and the twist is pulled off very well and packs a big punch to the viewer.",2009
8,"Every once in a while a film seems destined to slip under the radar either by poor promotion or a trailer that makes the viewer go ""meh"". Orphan is one of those flicks that, while benefiting from a decent studio push, simply didn't impart any compelling reason to check it out based on the trailer, which is too bad because this is actually one tight little thriller.",2009
9,"Dark, edgy, twisted, effective, clever, intense, and blackly comic - one of the best ""evil child"" films I've seen. It's brilliantly cast - Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard are top-notch as usual, but what really stood out where the natural performances director Jaume Collet- Serra was able to get from the child actors. Usually child actors are painful to watch, but 12- year-old Isabelle Fuhrman gives a terrifying, chilling performance that is worthy of praise. Aryana Engineer in her screen debut as the deaf little sister Max is adorable and almost steals the show in every scene. The stylish cinematography, editing, and sound are fantastic as well. ",2009
10,"I have not seen a decent horror film in a long time, but this one is definitely worth the money. Be sure to use the restrooms before the start of the movie, as it is very riveting and suspenseful. Except for one sex scene between the husband and wife, this film can be viewed by mature children accompanied by an adult. It is very well written, and well-balanced. Personally I found this film very entertaining, suspenseful, and the plot cleverly written. Without getting into too much detail and ruining it for everyone else, this movie is in a category in which the story could become true in the future. Isabel Furhman did a great job starring as an orphan adopted by a couple who was looking to fill a void in the family due to an earlier tragedy. Her ability to manipulate her siblings as well as her adoptive father, thoroughly frustrates the mother. As the movie progresses, her manipulative abilities become more apparent and deadly. This is a must-see movie and I said money well spent.",2009
6,"""Orphan"" is sometimes regarded as a horror film, but in my view it is an example of that sub-genre of the thriller which I have come to regard as the "" from Hell"" movie, a type of film which enjoyed great popularity in the late eighties and early nineties following the success of ""Fatal Attraction"". The basic premise of such films is that the life of the protagonist is turned upside-down by the arrival of a stranger who initially seems friendly but who quickly turns out to be dangerous, generally a murderer or psychopath. In most films this stranger is an adult, but this film brings us the adopted-child-from-Hell. The expression ""from Hell"", incidentally, is not to be taken literally; ""Orphan"" might start out like an unacknowledged remake of ""The Omen"", but the child's evil is explained by a plot twist which has nothing to do with Satan or the supernatural.",2011
8,"I had been reading a lot about this film. Internet rumors made ""Orphan"" sound depraved. Advocacy groups protested that the film is offensive to adoption. ""Orphan"" is neither depraved nor offensive if you watch it as a thriller.",2009
7,"We've seen Orphan many times before (The Bad Seed, The Good Son and, of course, The Omen), yet, somehow, Jaume Collet Serra manages to squeeze something fresh out of an old tale.",2009
9,"Anyone expecting a horror film will most likely give this a 5 star rating or below. All others will be thoroughly entertained. Orphan is an INTENSE drama... full of surprises and a bit of suspense.. would have been more suspenseful for me if I had not gathered story details beforehand. Even knowing the score, I give it high marks as its execution is brilliant. The acting is flawless on all parts and I would not at all be surprised if this one picked up an award or three. Finally! Some character development! Finally! A story! Even with the darker bits of the script omitted from the film, this was a good thrill-ride. Think DRAMA and you will be pleased. There's something wrong with Esther... Haha, an understatement to say the least. Great tagline!",2009
5,"Scary movie yes, but the suspension of belief was not possible. This couple would never have been allowed to adopt a child and were actually lucky still to have their own kids. Mum was a recovering alcoholic who had been guilty of neglect on a previous occasion and had lost a baby of her own just months before?? Father was so dim that it was painful to watch him. He was also an admitted adulterer. The shrink spun nothing but clichés and had already made up her mind about her own patient, er, I think not. She was clearly not a child psychiatrist either.",2009
5,**** SPOILERS!!*****,2010
9,"Orphan, the name says very little for what you get to see in the movie. I watched great horrors/thrillers, this movie with mild brutality and refreshingly thrill creates a great impression on audience pulses. Esther, especially, acted terrific in portraying psychotic behavior and the screenplay was just perfect to make it a picture perfect.",2009
7,"""Orphan"" was a movie that truly did surprised me. I mean I came into this movie honestly not having any idea which direction it would take me, I mean sure it looked good, but then again the 30 second previews made it seem a bit mediocre. When the movie went off I was very pleased by what I had seen. The things I love most about Orphan is how they present and introduce these characters so well. The minute I saw the main couple I couldn't help but take a liking to them, and Esther who very easily steals the show, is incredibly likable. As a matter of fact the thing I do love a lot about the film is how they take their time in the story, I loved how for the first half or so you see Esther adapting to her new surroundings, and I became extremely indulged into this. I also think they balanced out the character of Esther well. I mean this performance, and character, could have easily been portrayed as this over-the-top, annoying, non-intimidating, and non-believable character, but not once do you ever feel that. Also it is very entertaining, and you're hooked from the moment you see this little girl Esther. It was also clever at times, to where you feel a sense of danger as far as the story goes because it's literally like anything can happen. Even if does begin to make you mad for whatever reason, you still can't help but keep watching and wondering. At times it may feel predictable, but they've already presented these characters so well, that you can't but feel that maybe you haven't predicted it. I will say I wished ""Orphan"" HAD paced itself a little better, I mean they don't immediately jump into the story, but when they do it feels rushed and as if they fear the audience won't care about the characters, when it's not true. Also towards the end the characters start to lose liking, so much so that I couldn't help but look at these characters(in particular the mom and dad) and say ""Who are you, and why are you being such an unlikable stereotype!"" As a result of the characters acting stupid and stereotypical at this point in the film it just became predictable to an extent where you knew what was going to happen. Last you know I don't know how I felt about the twist, it was done well enough to where it would fit the storyline, but I feel it defeats the shocking, brutal, and thrilling nature of the film. Anyways, overall ""Orphan"" is one of the better thrillers you'll probably see this year, and even if you're not too big on these kind of films, I still recommend ""Orphan""",2009
5,"I'm about two thirds of the way through watching this film, and I must say it's really annoying me how the director constantly relies on the technique of using scary music and odd camera angles to build false tension. Then, just when you think something really scary is going to happen, it turns out to be a false alarm.",2009
6,I went into this film really wanting to love it. And I can honestly say that certain aspects of it I DID love. ,2009
5,"Why did I watch this movie?? Almost every single movie that has this type of premise is the exact same movie no matter what age or gender the antagonist is. The ""bad guy"" is hurting or killing animals and people at the beginning and then there is always the person who knows that something is wrong who can't ever seem to get anyone to believe them.",2011
10,"I thought that this would be one more piece to be added to the whole collection of poorly-made horror movies, but it proved me wrong. What to say of the movie? Just that it's fascinating. The way which David Johnson planned the plot is worth applauding. It grips you all through, by either scariness or surprise. It's also worth mentioning the secrecy built over Esther backgrounds, which is finally revealed in the end. It's so well constructed and performed that you get hooked throughout the whole movie without even noticing that it's a strategy put into use by the director. Now the dignified work delivered by the cast. It's so opposite to the far-fetched acting of other movies. Actually, I wasn't expecting much from the actors, since there were no renowned names listed, but they lived up to my expectations. Isabelle, who was only 12 when the movie was shot, was one of the biggest findings in my opinion; she just managed to play very convincingly an arduous and demanding role of a mentally-disordered girl. So, if you are already done with horror movies based on a thin plot and that don't go deep into the inner feelings of human beings, try Orphan, I assure you are going to like it.",2013
5,"So there are two good things about this film and I will start with them. First, it creates a good atmosphere and causes the viewer emotions of sympathy for the ""good guys"" and fear and anger for the ""bad guy"". Second, it contains a clever twist that could not be foreseen, although some guesses will come close. Then, there's the bad things. This film is full of every cliché in the book. Every character you have ever seen in a similar film in the past is present. The one person who suspects the truth but whose skeletons in the closet make them non-credible. The person who is completely ignorant to the truth and thinks the other is crazy. The one who knows the truth but is swayed into not telling anything. And the one who decides to expose the truth and pays for it. And the villain who is evil for the sake of being evil and does evil things because they are so very evil. If one removes the sentiment of deja-vu that this film casts on its viewers, what is left is a film that maintains a certain degree of interest but has nothing to offer that has not been done before and better. Granted, the acting is credible, the cinematography is good and the ending is satisfying. However, there are just so many clichés in this film that half-way through, any experienced viewer of the genre will have figured the rest of the film out, with the exception of the one clever twist.",2009
5,"In motion pictures, it's a widespread belief that children are the embodiment of pure evil. Perhaps not all kids are the spawn of Satan, but horror filmmakers realise that evil disguised behind the eyes of a seemingly innocent child is an effective way of amplifying the scare factor. Into this genre now steps 2009's Orphan. Instead of being an overly effective suspense piece, however, this is a predominantly boring, meandering film which suffers from repetition and poor scripting. If the creepy kid horror genre is in need of resuscitation, this subpar affair will not provide it.",2010
1,"dude seriously, i cannot believe you guys all liked this movie. I just saw it like 2 minutes ago and it was probably the worst thing i've seen all year. And i saw transformers 2 this year... so thats saying a lot. For one, there was probably more unbelievable things in this movie than any other movie i've ever seen. Peter sarsgaard was the biggest ... idiot EVER in this film. I've never wanted to castrate someone more in my life. The kids were both idiots, even the deaf one... if someone threatens my balls with an exacto knife, im tellin someone about it. They covered NOTHING about the adoption, all the sudden the kid is in the house. Later on in the movie they start doing background checks, you think they would do that before they ACTUALLY ADOPT THE CHILD!!! Honestly, one of the worst films i've seen all year. I don't care if this contains spoilers because im doing everyone a favor that reads this that hasn't seen the film. The diologue is unbelievable and terribly written. You don't like any of the characters, and actually, you hate them all. No part of this story makes any sense, and the twist at the end is surprising, yet ridiculous.",2009

10,"A whole language of deceit is created by a father to make sure that his family don't venture into the unknown which he fears will corrupt them. This film talks about the myths and lies we are told to maintain status quo and the appearance of stability and normality. It explores the abuse of protecting a child from outside influences to the extreme of denying human instincts and inquisitiveness about their world. Its shows how telling children lies for their own safety makes them fearful of the world and patronises there innate understanding about life. Its amazing because it creates a world with an absurd, fully realised, vocabulary that is completely understood by the members of this family ; its surreal nature forces you to question the oddness and the parameters of your own existence. A life unquestioned and unexplored leads to a stagnant swamp of confusion.",2010

9,"Dogtooth is not a comedy. The absurd situations in this film became humorous several times but I always choked on my laughter as the subject matter was too serious to be funny. The film is about three young adults who live with their parents in a large but isolated walled compound; the two young women and the young man have no knowledge of the world outside of this place and not much of the world inside of it. In fact the parents deliberately mislead them with nonsense on nearly every topic, for instance they claim that men are commonly killed by cats. Additionally, the siblings are taught the wrong words for certain objects and concepts, thus a ""salt shaker"" becomes a ""telephone."" These young people have been given a mostly carefree extended childhood at the cost of ever having any autonomy or knowledge. The parents' theory seems to be that the world is a terrible place and contact with it is more damaging than an isolated life. This Eden-like setting is a blessing and a curse: the characters are free of most problems that face normal people; they have no real responsibility and thus no worry. Still, like any human they yearn for answers and they have a certain half formed desire to be the masters of their own destinies. Further, in what seems to be a recent development the children are seeking an outlet for their sexual needs; while the parents can prevent them from being exposed to any stimulus they cannot stop biological urges from surfacing. Any solution to this problem is bound to upset the already fragile artificial world in which they live.",2010

Its best surprise that I've got in years. You don't have to be special to watch it, just sit and you'll end it living it, even that it isn't your life. I appreciate latter how good the movie was when I realized that all the scenes didn't need background violins to drive your emotions to a certain field. Everything goes by itself naturally. I just registered to post this, as I couldn't believe those bad reviews. I'm a normal guy that doesn't read reviews, but this movie is different and I was curious about how would other people feel about it. Maybe its one of those that you just love or hate, but at the end you'll feel something that isn't indifference.",2010
8,"In Greece, when talking about Greek movies we like, one of the expressions we mostly use is ""it was good, for a Greek movie"". I am glad to say that this one was good, period. It is definitely not an easy movie to watch, as it can be really intense and deals with one or two traditionally taboo issues, but it is definitely worth giving it a chance. For me it has been a completely surreal experience, best described as stepping into a world as peaceful as heaven and as confining as hell, where things seem to work in their own whimsical way, leaving me with a constant bafflement as to what is to come next. I honestly did not realize how time went by and, when it all came to an end, I found myself asking for more. This is a movie that disturbed, moved and fascinated me while I was watching it and made me think after having watched it. It is surreal, it is symbolic (it could definitely be seen from a political point of view), it is ironic and at times it can be unexpectedly funny in a dark, twisted way. Directing it in a ""dry"", ""strict"" manner, as if just trying to capture the events that take place, was definitely a perfect choice, as was the complete absence of music. The actors did a great job at acting in the emotionally detached manner that was required plus, I have to say, it probably took lots of guts for them to do some of their most ""awkward"" scenes. All in all, I would say I admired the artistic integrity of the director and actors and their dedication to getting across the main idea and the atmosphere of this movie.",2011
8,"If you are easily offended by bold unusual film-making especially in the areas of sex and violence do not see this film. That said I just saw this at the Palm Springs International Film Festival and thought it was a very interesting and very brave film. Well worth seeing if you can like strong, unusual films. Probably close to 30% of the audience walked out, but I was encouraged by the 70+% that remained, especially since most of the audience were 60+ Americans. The 20-somethings I talked to on the way out were very enthusiastic. The woman sitting next to me said ""What did it mean? I don't understand"" but to me there were enough deep meanings and points to ponder on a 30-minute drive home and I can't wait to tell friends about it. Everything from the dangers of creating a ""perfect family"" to ""the mechanization of capitalism and upper middle class life"" to metaphors for the dangers of repressive families and governments. At it's simplest, it proves that people, especially young ones, are in so many ways what their parents make them. This is not a film you will forget!",2010

So this film is not for everyone, but if you like realistic and paced films, are not bothered by highly explicit scenes, don't mind taboo subjects, like independent film and are into original stories.... this is the movie for you. I've read negative comments about this movie. I get it. It's not the most easy movie to watch, but I haven't been this pleasantly surprised in a long time. Saw this in Sitges with a packed audience, and I believe most of the people there were glued to the screen and didn't want to see the film end. Surreal, emotional, cruel, realistic and beautiful would be the words I would use to describe this picture. At first you don't really understand what's going on or where you're at, but soon find yourself submerged in the sad and pathetic life of a disturbed family. This is definitely one of the most important indie films of the year; aside from the original and highly meaningful story, the film if impeccably made with astounding performances.

Yes, it serves no function unless your idea of entertainment is to get bored. Towards the end of the film, I ask myself: what is the purpose or message? There are those who see in this film a social / family allegory, because we are largely the product of our education and of the lies we're told taken as truth, but even that perspective does not save the film from my negative evaluation, it was very badly thin and NO, it does not have a deeper meaning.

1,"If I learned anything from reading viewer reviews on IMDb it is that no matter how good I think a film is someone is going to hate it, and vice versa. I've also learned that when a film has won an award at Cannes there's a good chance it's going to be awful. I've concluded that some people like certain films solely because they are ""different."" Even when there is no story, no humor, or no action a film can still have some value if it has one essential element - truth. This film has absolutely nothing. The ""characters"" portrayed are no-shows. There are no reasons for their actions - they have no ""reality."" That's okay for a comedy, but this film isn't the least bit funny.",2011
10,"I'll start by saying: This is the best film I've ever seen! I think if you summon up Seidl, Haneke, Korine and Trier the result is Lanthimos. I'm speechless. Suddenly I remember why films like this has to be made. I love what there's no rules. When there's not necessary a need for understanding and no fixed answers given. It's a film you shouldn't even write an review about. It peels of every false layer of the human being and at deepest question the modern humanity. What have we become. It says to us: think outside the box. Live, without limitations. Embrace, even the madness. Life is a play. Now when this is said I must also compliment how beautifully it's filmed and edited. The scene with the barking dogs, which abruptly breaks into silence and into the tragic family constellation. It's finest art. And I laughed loudly, and my heart beating so fast. I was falling in love. I love this film, just as much as I love for example Elfrede Jelinek's texts. I love this film so much it hurts. I have no more words.",2010
10,"I saw this movie at the Dublin International Film Festival this year and I was totally blown away. The critics award went to Samson & Delilah; I saw both and i'm amazed that it went to the the movie it did. The film is gory in parts, but it is in no way just for the sake of it: it's all relevant. It reminded me of Lars Von Triers ""The Idiots"". This movie has been firmly planted onto my psyche and I await its general release so I can go see it again. Of course there will be people who won't like the movie due to its sometimes extreme scenes: if this is the case and you're a little bit squeamish, then stay away. The urge for me to keep associating this film with those of Lars Von Trier's is hard for me to abate, and another connection could be made with Antichrist: if you liked Antichrist, I think you will immensely love this; if you found Antichrist hard to stomach then it's probably best not to view this: I doubt you'll appreciate its beauty through its intense harshness.",2010

I can take graphic scenes. I can stomach controversial material. But I felt dirty and unfulfilled after watching this movie, and not in a good way. I really have trouble finding words to say so that I can fill up the 10 lines, but at the end of this movie, I had difficulty finding words to describe how crappy it was. I suppose it works out. The movie was not deep. It was not what many people say on here as representing something bigger and more profound. I know the Greeks can do a better job than they did with this movie. Don't waste your time.",2011
1,"When i watched this movie i was so excited about it. It was a very original movie with a shocking story that reflected the extreme degree of fear of a man in respect with the modern world. The story was centered by the day with day life of one brother and two sisters, dad and mom. After a couple of years i found that it is an ""updated"" copy of a Mexican movie named ""Castle of purity"" 1973 directed by Arturo Ripstein. The story was also based in a real event that happened in Mexico during 1950's. For my surprise the original story of Ripstein has also one brother and two sisters, the two older ones were going through adolescence... i am not against remades but in certain way i feel me bad because i am a writer, and i think it is important look about the violation of author rights and the effort of having a work done and somebody stealing and having credits for it. Also the reviews of the movie i had read express the way the director ""thought about the story"". The movie Kyonodontas won a Cannes award, the movie of Ripstein didn't.",2013

8,"Let me say up front that most fans of the Coen brothers' early films might be disappointed if they're expecting ""Fargo"", ""The Big Lebowski"" or even ""O Brother"". Unlike those movies, here we don't have a lot of plot, comedy or action. The message of the film is very challenging, and it requires a lot of thought to figure out what they're saying.",2011
10,"The Coen brothers have developed critical acclaim for making black comedies/awkward tragedies that depict small-time people getting in way over their heads, who for one reason or another are motivated to do things out of the ordinary because the natural order of the world and society has wronged them in some way.

3,The only thing fairly remarkable or remotely intriguing about this film is the opening wherein a Yiddish-speaking Jew of the 19th century invites (accidentally) a dybbuk (evil spirit in the shape of a man) into his family home. The ominous turn of events and the wife's sensible solution to the situation is comical and you would think the film would build on such an interesting prologue.,2010
9,"You may have to be a believer (Jewish or Christian) to like this film, although some secular (at least middle-aged midwestern) Jews and others may find it worthwhile for the period details. It is a modern version of the book of Job, which--of course you remember--contains a prologue in which God and Satan bet on whether Job will remain faithful and Satan then strikes down Job's flocks, children, and health; a series of speeches by three comforters with Job's responses; a speech by Elihu who is unhappy with the advice of the three comforters; the Lord himself answering Job directly out of the whirlwind ('who is this who darkens counsel by words without knowledge?'); a final submissive speech by Job ('I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye see thee, wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes'); and an epilogue in which Job receives more flocks and children (...) than he had before.",2009
10,"The Coen Brothers give to its frazzled protagonist Larry Gopnick a line a few times during the course of A Serious Man, ""I didn't do anything!"" that is more than just an homage to Franz Kafka - it's ripping him off basically. This is not to say Larry is quite in the same predicament of Joseph K. Then again, I wonder if Larry would prefer no explanation to the if-it-wasn't-for-bad-luck-I-would-have-no-luck status over the kinds he gets to his troubles. He has a divorce pending and his wife leaving with Sy Ableman (seriously, Sy Ableman!), he has a South Korean student who may be simultaneously bribing him and suing him for defamation, he has a brother who has a cyst/no job/gambling troubles, two kids who more or less are just typically dysfunctional teens (the boy on his way to be Bar Mitzvah and smoking enough dope to acknowledge more than once that it's 1967), and his sexual repression is practically taunted by the foxy Jewish woman next door who sunbathes nude. And what does God have to say about this? Oh, don't get him started on trips to the Rabbi - frankly, he'd have better luck with Anton Chigurh.",2009

2,"This movie has only two things good: image quality and cultural accuracy. I am a high def constant viewer and i have to say the 1080p of this movie is one of the best i ever seen. Apart from this two highlights the ""A Serious Man"" has nothing to offer unless a big wast of time. I waited until the end to see a revelation or a critical turn over of the events because without that the movie is about nothing. The end is abrupt and it surprises you but that doesn't give it quality and it's cheap and easy. The movie is about the disgrace of a pathetic and stupid man that does nothing to change his sad life. That's it, nothing more nothing less. The good reviews you see out there are meant to claim an alternative movie and scream out loud: ""I like this movie because i see beyond the banal viewer and only i can understand its depth."" A good movie, or at least a watchable movie, needs to have personality, purpose and a message. This movie fails in all three and only successes on being annoying as hell.",2010

9,"I saw this movie at TIFF on Saturday. The Coens quietly (and I mean quietly - no-one could hear even their amplified voices) introduced the movie with reference to the actors present but not the movie, letting it speak for itself. And it did. In its own way. It is an off-beat (what else?) and serious work that radiates bleak despair while searching for a funny bone. In the process, the movie makes other black comedies look positively light and airy. The movie evokes laughs from a different place than most – from a profound discomfort watching people twist themselves this way and that to fit in and be regarded seriously, whether situationally, socially or religiously. A great piece of work that will have you thinking long afterwards, especially considering the odd and difficult-to-contextualize prologue and, um different, ending which bookend a remarkable work.",2009
1,"One, you do not need to totally understand Judaism to get this film. Yes, the beginning of the film lays the groundwork that tells the viewer that any descendants of the Jewish couple who ""killed"" the Dybbuk is doomed to experience letdowns, but then again, maybe not. It is just a basic folktale, one from any religion or culture. Second, you do not need to understand physics either. Other than the passing of time seems to not pass at all while watching this film. After almost 40 minutes I had had it. Yes, a lot of %$&^ is dumped on this guy, and you wonder why he would deserve to be dumped on so much, but then you do not care. None of the characters were worth the time or effort. Maybe past the 40-minute mark it gets better, but alas I could not justify wasting my time to see what happened, and why. The acting was OK, but not worth the time to sit through this film, which might be better titled, A Pathetic Man.",2010
9,"I just saw this film earlier today and I have to say that it was simply thrilling. Now how can I possible say that it was thrilling when there were zero action scenes, zero suspense, and zero plot? To me, it's exactly because it lacks those things that makes this film thrilling! If you are reading through these IMDb reviews, you already know the general premise of the movie and have likely seen the preview, and so knowing that it is a Coen brothers movie you probably know what kind of film to expect.

9,"Jefferson Airplane's ""Somebody to Love"" hovers over the scenes of the Coen brothers' A Serous Man, the story of a Sixties Minnesota Jewish college professor with a small family whose life starts to fall apart. One of the Coens' strangest and most thought-provoking films, this one is a black comedy, a meditation on Jewishness, and a modern rethinking of the Book of Job in a world where ""Hashem"" (God) isn't just incomprehensible but largely imperceptible. The movie has been seen as a mean-spirited product of self-hating Jews, but that's not right at all. Returning to their roots and their tribe, the Coens have never been more serious or, in their sardonic way, more kind. To see life as a cosmic joke is really quite orthodox. It just doesn't lend itself to easy answers. And the rabbis the professor consults haven't got any. They've got, basically, nothing.",2009

1,"In a nutshell, the movie takes place in the 60's, in a very American/Jewish neighborhood. If I was Jewish I probably would take offense, because almost all the characters in the movie are unbearable for one reason or another. However, the Coen brothers are equal opportunities offenders and even if this movie concentrates on a Jewish environment, their other movies are generously filled with deepest contempt for all humankind, regardless of race, sex, nationality or religion.",2010

1,"A Serious Man was seriously one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I saw it on Saturday and really had no idea what I was getting into. All I really knew about it was that it was a Coen Brothers movie which can either be hit or miss in my opinion. I thought it would be one of those movies that is really good independent type and only out in a limited amount of theaters, until Oscar gets a hold of it and everyone goes to see it and love it. Kind of like Slumdog Millionaire. Boy was I wrong! I had no idea this was such a Jewish, religious movie. Not only did I feel weird watching it, but felt very confused and bored. I actually didn't fall asleep, but I couldn't wait to get out of the theater. I was pretty much done with the movie half hour into it. There was no plot, no big movie stars, the kid cursing all the time is not funny, and it's was just simply horrible. I agree with one comment earlier that said do not waste your two hours or $11 on this movie, don't rent it, do not see it at all!!!",2009

A few good laughs in an otherwise mediocre script and a movie that isn't quite sure of its target audience. Rather than repeat what has been said before, I'd like to use the opportunity to talk about an issue that really bothered me. Towards the end, around the time our main characters reach the fabled ""Eden East"", the jokes recede and the dialog takes on a more serious note. The men start to discuss each other's relationships, which is then followed by a number of appropriate make-up scenes for each of the four couples.",2009
2,"What a wasted opportunity! They take 2 of our finest comedians, a beautiful cast of hard working actresses, and a great tropical setting and it comes out a stale, lifeless. laugh-free mess. Man, this was painful to watch. Vince fired off a few smile inducing one liners in the start-up domestic setting, and that was the last smile they got out of me. Once the cast was moved to the tropics, everything went wrong. Male on male embarrassment was overused -- about 5 times. Vince tried a few off the wall diatribes that fell flat. Young women swoon over Jon Favereau (huh?!?!) and he ignores the fabulous Kristen Davis?! The pratfalls to marriage are glossed over and play out badly. Every scene seems to last about 5 beats too long. Favereau gets not one, but two masturbation scenes. What??! Neither comes even close to delivering any humor. All 4 couples have shaky or totally damaged relationships and then in a 10 minute whirlwind finale, all solve their problems in a totally superficial way. And I couldn't possibly have cared less about the ""Guitar Hero"" duel. Yikes!! ",2009
4,"I'm unsure what is more worrying, that Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau starred in such a mediocre comedy or the fact that they wrote it. Good friends and regular collaborators Vaughn and Favreau have had mixed results in their working partnership: Swingers is a bona-fide cult classic which tore up the indie circuit back in 1996; Made was a disappointment to all those expecting Swingers 2; The Break-Up was a successful guilty pleasure and Four Holidays (Four Christmases in the US) flopped massively at the US box-office. Where does Retreat fit in? Somewhere near Four Holidays – but at least they didn't also write that.",2009
5,"I watched this for free On Demand and still felt ripped off. Where do I start? The tone is so uneven that the scenes with the therapists are played straight despite the fact that two of them were played by John Michael Higgins and Ken Jeong, two guys who must struggle NOT to get laughs. It is almost as if they hired the actors and then decided to go a different direction -- if they even put that much thought into it. Before this debacle finally and mercifully staggers to an end it starts to feel as if they are literally making it up as they go along. There is no clear reason for this movie to even exist except as an excuse for the cast and crew to enjoy an nice tropical vacation, squeezing in a little movie work while they are there. Lazy, unprofessional filmmaking that is an insult to the audience.",2010

The plot is ridiculously contrived, a couple is having troubles so to reassess their lives they want to go to a beautiful retreat but can't afford it even though they seem rich so they force their friends to go also on a weeks notice. The club is said to be so hard to get into but for some reason they offer half price for 4 couples, which makes a lot of sense. Their only black friend who seems completely out of place here (and not because he's black) has no money but who is buying a motorcycle somehow, can also go with his 20 year old love tart whom everyone has no problem with joining them even though she obviously only cares that he buys her things but agrees to go through couples counseling even though they just met.",2009

But even with that, I still wanted to see this movie, it did look honestly funny, but I didn't get to see it until the Monday after it opened originally. I was hearing some bad or okay reviews which disappointed me. But in my opinion, it doesn't matter, it's what you think of the movie, so I still saw it.

Casting did a great job in booking the talent. Peter did a good job on the set. The plot could work with better writers. The story was weak and fragmented.

Although it wasn't close to their best, Vaughn and Favreau still know how to make you laugh. Vaughn was doing his normal act (which at this point he seems to be kicking a dead horse) but all in all he helped the film and didn't distract. Now Favreau wrote himself a little gem in this movie as the guy who is sick of his marriage and just wants to be carefree again. The film has an excellent cast but Favreau definitely stole the show. Every time he was on the screen he was dropping some funny business. All the supporting actors did a great job as well. Was expecting more from Ken Jeong but he wasn't given much to work with. (Has it now become mandatory to put Ken in every movie that comes out just because?) The location was beautiful and they used it wisely. Carlos Ponce also gave an unforgettable performance as the creepy yoga instructor. He was actually at the screening I was at to get a taste of the people erupting with laughter every time he was on screen. Seemed like I was the only one who recognized him to due his change in appearance from the movie. As for all those people who are trying to tag this as a Sarah Marshall ripoff, they couldn't be further from the truth. This movie is set in a tropical location and has Kristen Bell in it.

10,"Seriously, I'm convinced, Pixar is maybe the only movie studio that is providing the best movies around. Who said that animated films can't be considered real movies? Can't be considered an art form? Up is the latest creation from Disney and Pixar, after last year's smash hit WALL-E, I felt like they couldn't at all top themselves and they did it again with this incredibly charming story. Admittingly from the trailer, I wasn't sure this story was going to work as well, but I got the opportunity to see Up this week and was just totally blown away by it's story, animation and characters. The thing I adore about these movies that Disney and Pixar are creating is that they're not just for the kids, but the adults as well, this is something that I could even see an adult seeing by themselves. This story doesn't insult kid's intelligence and is extremely entertaining for anyone to enjoy, to go through this adventure with an old man who just wanted to make his wife happy.",2009
8,"Greetings again from the darkness. Another crackling collaboration of Pixar and Disney, and as expected, it is touching, funny, thrilling and amazing to look at and watch. Only a step below Toy Story just because it is not quite as ground-breaking, though the story is even better.",2009
10,"If Pixar - as a studio - has any weakness, it's that they have no idea how to make a bad film. Again and again they release entertaining movies with not only a terrific sense of humor, but a level of storytelling that has set a standard for today's films, animated or otherwise. While I was obviously extremely excited to see Up, never did I expect it - or, to be honest, anything else from this year - to reach the level of quality of this year's first animated film, Coraline (which, along with last year's Bolt and Wall-E, became one of my favorite films of all time). Well, I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. Simply put, Up is a perfect movie.",2009
9,"This is another film in which it really helps to know in advance what it is, or more specifically, what it isn't. Then, you go from there. I enjoyed the animated film very much but, some of that was due to the fact a friend clued me in first, saying ""this isn't really a comedy or a film for little kids. Don't expect a ton of laughs."" So, instead of seeking laughs (although I still got them here and there), I just enjoyed the adventure story and marveled at the amazing artwork. ",2009
10,What can I say about Pixar? Amazing?? Perfect?? Got to see this at the Cannes Film Festival in France (went on a trip with my family) and Pixar gives us another instant classic: Up.,2009
10,"Pixar has become the most dependable studio out there for producing reliable films that don't simply continue to raise the bar in animation but set a level of excellence in storytelling that puts most live-action movies to shame. 'Up' represents another change in style, as significant as Wall-E's shift to photorealism, intricate camera effects and darker themes. It effectively blends moments of tragedy with almost slapstick humor, while showing that their understanding of story structure and pacing gets more refined with every release.",2009
8,"""Up"" is a winner, and I couldn't be less surprised. Anyone still putting a limit on how new and inventive they think a Pixar film can be deserves to have their socks blown off. For the rest of us, just buy a ticket and expect to be taken away. This new flick is the work of writers/directors Pete Docter and Bob Peterson, two guys who have each been around the making of Pixar flicks before. Docter was a director on ""Monsters Inc"", a writer on ""Toy Story"" and a co-writer and director on ""Wall*E."" Peterson was a writer on ""Finding Nemo"". Both know the guidelines for success and while ""Up"" doesn't reach the heights of say a ""Wall*E"" or a ""Toy Story"", it's still a fantastic movie because, well, I don't think the people Pixar hires know how to make anything other than fantastic movies.",2009
10,"Sadly, there aren't enough superlatives in the English language with which to laud Up, the latest offering from the folks at Disney/Pixar. This is quite simply the best movie of any genre to emerge thus far this year. No small praise considering how I've long been adverse to ""kids movies"", pegging them as being shallow, vapid, and simplistic - a personal preconception which Pixar mercifully shattered with 2004's The Incredibles and 2008's WALL-E, which proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that for all their acclaim as an animation studio, they are equally brilliant story tellers Up tells the story of Carl Fredricksen (voiced by Ed Asner), who as a child meets Ellie, later to become the love of his life. Carl and Ellie find they share a common dream – to one day visit Paradise Falls, a mysterious tropical oasis in South America made famous in vintage newsreels chronicling the exploits of explorer/adventurer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer). Life, however, manages to get in the way as the two grow up, get married, experience the pain of miscarriage, and eventually grow old, so much so that father time catches up on Ellie, leaving Carl a widower. All of this is conveyed with little dialog in a masterful sequence that had the audience, old and young alike, sniffling throughout.",2009
7,"In terms of animated features, Pixar ventures where very few other animated films have gone before and that is to delve into the lives of the elderly generation. In fact, having any film (animated or not) examine what it is like to grow old and the roller coaster ride that is life would normally mean you are in for some heavy material indeed. This is because true depictions of life are not constantly joyful and grand, it is always hand in hand with tears and hardships. In this respect, Pixar are to be applauded to have dared create a ""kids"" film that explores the circle of life in all its vivid glory and personal heartache.",2009
5,"Am I the only one who thinks this movie is overrated? I was so excited when I saw the 9.2/10 rating late Friday night and couldn't wait to see it the next morning. I told my daughter we were going to see a very good movie on the way to the theater. My expectation was so high and I had been waiting for those good things coming to me throughout the whole movie, then found out there was nothing, no excitement nor surprise in this movie at all! Right now, I cannot recall a single thing which I think is special in this movie. A very so-so movie with a very typical Hollywood ending. There should be better story tellers out there. There should be a better movie deserves such high rating. Even my 7-year old daughter thought this movie was just OK. Very disappointed!",2009
3,"I own every Pixar film on DVD but I have to say that UP may be the first one I pass on. I was very excited about seeing the film today after reading several good reviews. I think now that perhaps some reviewers out there are letting the Pixar reputation get to them. I can't believe ANYONE would say this is one of the best films of the year. Films like MONSTERS, INC, FINDING NEMO, WALL-E and TOY STORY deserved accolades like that but UP doesn't have the heart those classics did. The film is at its best early on when the characters aren't talking much. We see a montage of the lead character's life as a young Carl meets an exuberant girl named Ellie. We see them marry, live a life together, experience the highs and lows of life and finally, we see Carl loose his beloved Ellie and become a widower living alone in the house that always was their home. This sequence is moving and made me think that Pixar was about to strike another home run. However, at this point the characters start talking more and the story starts to get a bit...much. Carl decides to tie a bunch of helium balloons to his house in order to fly the house off to South America on the adventure he and Ellie were never able to complete together. He unwillingly takes along a young boy scout stand-in (Russell) who ends up on Carl's porch when the house takes off. Russell is determined to earn the patch for helping the elderly required by his troop in order to graduate to senior status. The balloon premise is a bit far-fetched but since it's an animated film, you go with it. However, once in South America, things get progressively weirder. Carl and Russell end up walking through the jungle and mountains with the house strapped to them, floating above. I think I knew the film was NOT going to be the usual classic I was used to from Pixar when they come across a bunch of talking dogs. It seems Pixar, whose done films about animals who can talk and done films just about humans, wanted to mix the two so they write into the story these dogs with collars that allow us to hear their thoughts. The dogs belong to an old adventurer living in the area who is determined to capture a big, ostrich-like bird to prove he's not the fake the world judge him to be decades ago when he claimed the bird existed. The adventurer has hundreds of dogs and not only do they search the jungles for the elusive bird, they also cook for their master, serve meals AND fly planes. Very weird. I think if you're going to make a film about smart, talking animals - make a film about smart talking animals (FINDING NEMO) and if you're going to do a film about humans, do one like THE INCREDIBLES about humans. In UP Pixar tries to mix the two and it just doesn't work. The ONE character who I thought had the most heart and was most interesting, was Kevin, the big bird who doesn't talk, seems devoted to her young and takes an instant liking to the human boy who probably reminds her of her babies. I heard kids in the audience more than once asking what was going on because they couldn't quite understand the story. I suspect UP will not be one of those films kids will watch over and over again like they do with the other Pixar classics. Pixar has some incredibly talented people but in UP I think they spent too much time on ""cool"" ideas and not as much time on developing the story and characters into something we could care about and believe in.",2009
5,"Once again, I shouldn't have trusted that preview, or it might have been that the short before ""Up"" was so wonderful, or was it that the mostly silent introduction to our main character was nothing short of glorious... somewhere, though, this film lost its ability to touch in the way other Pixar and animated features have done in the past.",2009
4,"It's gotten to the point that most people assume that whatever Pixar does, it's going to hit a home run. But in the case of their latest 3-D animated story, ""Up"", I'm sad to report that this new Pixar concoction does not live up to the all the hype. For those who are watching a Pixar animated film for the first time, of course 'Up' will seem quite impressive. After all, no other studio comes close to Pixar when it comes to the technical aspects of animation. But ultimately, whether a film is animated or not, it's the story and the characters that make a film great.",2009
4,"I'm a big fan of pixar movies, I think finding nemo, ratatouille and Wall-E (though to be fair I didn't like Wall-e either the first time I saw it) are some of the best examples of narrative storytelling in the last 20 years. Simply put, the Pixar clan know how to tell stories.",2009
5,"What I like about Pixar: they generally cover each of these levels: 1) the setting 2) the story, 3) the characters, 4) drama, 5) humor, 6) visuals. In the case of Up, the humor was not at all on par with previous Pixar releases. But the biggest problem was with the setting of the story, i.e. the world they create. In Monsters, Inc they could invent anything, because it was a fictitious world. In Toy Story, the toys could do anything, but the humans were generally bound to the same physical laws as the rest of us. That's where Up makes a gigantic misstep. The main character is rendered very realistically, visually, but does the impossible for an elderly arthritic at every turn (running pulling a house... excuse me?). Where did the talking dog collars come from? The villain is portrayed as a realistic human, but it makes no sense that he might (living in the rain forest, alone) invent a talking dog collar. He's an explorer, not an engineer. This was clearly just something Pixar pulled out of their ""funny ideas to stick in a movie someday"" jar. They should have looked to see if it fit, first.",2009
6,"It was a good movie, but not great. The beginning sequence was well-done, tender, and sweet, but it was not quite as emotionally affecting as I expected. I would have liked to see a couple more scenes of Carl and Ellie interacting with dialog because the scenes with them as kids didn't quite cut it for me...I liked how it set up Carl's instantaneous love for Ellie, foreshadowing the endurance of his love for her, but her character came off as unique (which was good) but also kind of annoying. If we got to see a little more of her character and dynamic with Carl, maybe a scene of her showing some love for him, I think the following music-only sequence and the whole movie would have been more emotionally compelling.",2009
9,LOOOVED this movie.,2009
8,"I just want to say that although I thoroughly enjoyed this film in many respects, it is not for children. It isn't as though they may not have fun watching it, as the visual effects are quite stunning, or they might not get a giggle or two from a few scenes, it's just that in order to fully appreciate the film you must have been in love at some point in your life...or at least comprehend love to the fullest extent.",2009

9,"Fullmetal Alchemist is, in a way, unique. It is very much a mainstream series, with the appeal of a huge cast of unique characters, action that commonly involves special powers, a fairly straight forward story with some mostly obvious symbolism, and a mix of comedy, action, drama, and even some romance. These are all common staples of long running anime series that lean towards a more commercial and public appeal. And yet, for a mainstream series, it manages to continually surprise with a very mature and serious tone. There is a great deal of tragedy and some moments are even frightening and memorable. Few series achieve such a perfect balance of mainstream entertainment and gut wrenching drama and tragedy.",2009
10,"Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood, I think is the best anime ever made.",2011
9,"Having been an avid fan of the first Fullmetal Alchemist series, i was highly apprehensive on hearing about this reboot, but the more i found out about the series, the more excited i became. I've always been a fan of the Manga, and the new series is being based completely of the manga storyline. This had be hooked, so i waited nervously for the first episode.",2009
10,"I have seen both versions of Fullmetal Alchemist (Brotherhood) and both are good. In the first version (Fullmetal Alchemist), the first half of the series is really good. The fight between Edward Elric & Roy Mustang and the State Alchemist test taken by Edward Elric are notable ones. In second half, the story takes lots of twists and turns and I find it's not as impressive as the first half.",2011
10,"I really loved the original FMA series and was really skeptical about watching this series. I just fell that the original series was so good that a new one was unnecessary. When I read that Brotherhood was all based on the Manga, I decided to give it a try, because the FMA began as a manga after all, I felt that I should watch the ""real"" story. ",2010

This goes horribly wrong because they neglected the basic rule of alchemy, the principal of equal exchange. To gain something from alchemy you must give something of equal value. The brothers' disastrous experiment costs Edward his left leg and Alphonse his entire body. Ed manages to affix Al's soul to a suit of armour, at the cost of his right arm and the two maimed boys are left alone to study alchemy in the hope of restoring themselves to normality.",2012
10,"Cartoon Network isn't what it used to be. As a kid, I watched CN because it had shows that appealed to tons of people, shows that had meaning, and shows that deserved to be labeled classics. Those shows are gone. Teen Titans, Samurai Jack, The Batman, Chowder, Kids Next Door, and more have been dismissed for garbage cartoons like Teen Titans Go! , Adventure Time, Ninjago, and Uncle Grandpa (No comment on those new Pokémon incarnations). With the exception of Clarence and Steven Universe, Cartoon Network is a joke. CN's lone redeeming factor is Toonami, a late-night segment form Saturday evening to Sunday morning where various anime are featured, and one of them used to be Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.",2015
8,"Brotherhood is a welcome addition to the Fullmetal Alchemist franchise, fully covering the storyline of the manga by Hiromu Arakawa. It's a wholly satisfying series which manages to stay engaging throughout its 64 episode run. Even though it follows the storyline of the manga very closely there are a few changes present. But the story is so impressive that it doesn't really matter if there are a few missteps. There are only ten instrumental music pieces by Akira Senju in the entire series, however, some of them are very effective. The opening and closing themes are catchy rock and pop songs which remind one of the first anime. So, is Brotherhood better than the first series? The answer is yes. The first series was emotionally satisfying though it contained a lot of filler. The second season was, for the most part, disappointing. Even the first season unnecessarily extended the manga's chapters, however, there was clearly originality there and the direction was noticeably good. The film Conqueror Of Shamballa was bad, no question about it. In fact the film was such a disappointment for me that I didn't want to watch Fullmetal Alchemist again. But later I picked up the manga, read it, and was amazed by the story and artwork. There are good reasons why the manga became such a big success. The animation in Brotherhood is an improvement. There are underlying political messages in the story that remind one of the United States. In conclusion, Brotherhood is a must-see anime, and after seeing it I don't feel like watching the first Fullmetal Alchemist anime again. I'm not a fan of anime and manga but Hiromu Arakawa's work is one of several which have to be seen.",2012
10,"To put it simply, this anime is nearly perfect. Coming from someone who enjoyed the first anime, I was reluctant to start watching Brotherhood because I expected it to be a slightly different version of the same story. Once I got around to watching it, I quickly realized that I was totally wrong. While the first few episodes may not explain the entire back story as well as the original did, to someone who has watched Fullmetal Alchemist, there shouldn't be any confusion. Once it gets going, Brotherhood is a much better developed, logical, and interesting story than Fullmetal Alchemist. This series has it all; action, drama, goofiness, and plenty of twists. I hated the ending to the first anime and watching the movie made it even worse. I was very satisfied with the ending of FMA: Brotherhood and plan on watching it again soon. I suggest watching both anime because they are both very different, however, Brotherhood is the perfect version of Fullmetal Alchemist and I recommend it to anyone.",2014
8,"Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood is a great way to waste some time. It is massive in its 64-episode length, but it hardly ever stops being interesting and its weak points are few. It's not mind-blowing, but I watched it happily all the way through and always wanted to see the next episode.",2012
6,"Although this is an entertaining show in its own right, and better than most things you can watch on TV these days, it's not on par with the original anime. The fact that it's faithful to the manga, unlike the 2003 series, is the main reason why Brotherhood is often preferred over the other and ranked higher. However, this says nothing about its quality and merits, only about its relationship with the original source. There are many aspects in which Brotherhood fails to meet the standards of the original Fullmetal Alchemist, among others:",2017

10,"First of all, I really liked this anime and I believe it is at least 2 times better than the ""original"" FMA. To clear things up with some people, Brotherhood is not a sequel to the original. The first FMA that aired on 2003-2004 is not original since it is not manga based. FMA is taken straight for the manga so doubting its humor, action and animation being worse than the first FMA that aired, makes no sense since the manga started both. That is my opinion of course. Now on to the Review..",2013
9,"I really didn't like the original series because I felt the writing was completely poor until the very end to where it ended up kinda decent. But there was way too much crap writing and filler episodes in the beginning and middle to make it worth getting to the end for only a decent experience. Brotherhood steps up both the beginning and the end of the series so that the beginning is decent and tolerable, but it builds on the stories and the characters and weaves a complex plot into one hell of a story filled with intrigue, political plots, revenge, and redemption in a great action-packed bundle. -1 star for kiddie romance/comedy in an otherwise mature-themed series. But kiddie romance/comedy in Anime seems nearly unavoidable so I guess I'll learn to tune it out eventually.",2011

Equally, all of us (yes even Brad Pitt) have experienced what it feels like to ""be"" dumped and the complex emotions that unexpectedly follow. If you're one of the fortunate souls that have managed to escape the throws of relationship hell, you'll probably fare better with renting the newest addition to the Rambo series.

9,"Who is Mark Webb? Anyone? Anyone? It is an astonishing piece of work for a first time feature film director. He counts with a beautifully crafted screenplay and two sensational leading performances and that's where the success of this comedy resides. Jodseph Gordon Levitt and Zooey Deschanel are two startling originals with a winning screen presence and a brain, yes, a brain. I was involved in their peculiar relationship because there isn't a hint of shallowness in their back and fourth. I believe it, completely, and when you sit in the dark and believe what you see on the screen, things are going to happen to you the way that happened to me. It is again a confirmation that treating your audience with respect will pay off somewhere along the line. I love Zooey Deschanel, she reminds me of some my favorites of the past without looking or sounding like anybody else. And Joseph Gordon Levitt, well, this young man is something else. He projects a humanity that doesn't need to be embellished. It's just there for us to dive into. Marvelous actor, marvelous performance, marvelous film. I'm so thrilled to be able to say that.",2009

Since the disintegration of her parent's marriage she'd only love two things. The first was her long dark hair. The second was how easily she could cut it off and not feel a thing.

Luckily for him the most perfect girl in the world, Summer, just started working at his office and wouldn't you know it, she loves The Smiths, too.

4,"I was really hoping and expecting to like this film. I was surprised to walk out of the theater annoyed at what seemed like an adolescent take on romantic love. Maybe part of the problem is that I recently watched Annie Hall. Like many other filmic treatments of love, 500 days seems derived from Annie Hall. There are Bergman references, cartoon characters, split screens, direct address of the audience which all smell and feel like the classic. Even the Deschanel character seems like a flat, more one dimensional,cynical version of Annie (she doesn't hold a candle to Diane Keaton, no where near the charm and far more disturbed) delivering conversation ending platitudes like ""what always happens...life."" (oooh, that's deep). Sis far more a caricature than anything else. I would lay bets her marriage ends in divorce and that she is much more pathological than the film lets you in on. The Joseph-Gordon Levitt character also seems unsophisticated and puerile. Although he is charming in his role, he is never in anything approaching love with this woman; he remains mired in his projections and idealizations of her and we are forced to watch this painful display of 14 year old obsession. I think by the end he gets it, but by then you have had to suffer right along with him. He is also not spared the stultifying writing {the quitting his job speech where he decides he's not going to be part of the ""bulls**t"" any longer) that makes this move sound like a grown ups Say Anything.",2009

The movie jumps back and forth in the storyline, which was a clever way to lay out the plot, but you have to pay attention, so you can keep track of how much time elapses between various key events. Great use of music. It's not explicitly stated, but the story is told from the perspective of the male lead, Tom, and thus neither you nor Tom ever quite understand why the female lead (Summer) feels or acts the way she does. This is important to know, because this is how things are in real life and often leads to frustration, especially if ""Boy falls in love. Girl doesn't."" Joseph Gordon-Levitt does a perfect job of making the viewer feel every high and low on Tom's 500-day journey, and Zooey Deschanel gives Summer the qualities of being both approachable and unattainable.",2009

1,"500 Days of Summer is a film that does not contain a single interesting idea although it tries so hard to say something. Films without a great message, even simple love films, are fine but the problem here: even a Hugh Grant film contains more humor, originality and soul. The events in 500 days of Summer are predictable (and even the narrative device of jumping back and forth in time cannot conceal it), the relationship between the protagonists are completely superficial, and there is not even one single interesting scene or even detail in this film. Summer and Tom are running through IKEA stores, singing Karaoke and sitting in the park. They talk about boring things in a pseudo-philosophical tone. To give a bit of an ""edge"" to it you got some reference to 1980s alternative music and Bergman films. Everything is in vain: the lack of chemistry between the lead actors (and their lack of talent) and the highly in-original script make this film a failure. Isn't there anything interesting to say about love anymore?",2010

From awful ones like ''What Happens in Vegas"" to ""Gigli"", from ""The Break-Up"" to the recent nightmare ""All About Steve"", the genre romantic comedy was dying off. But then, this miracle came along. ""(500) Days of Summer"" is an absolute fresh and original film. This is solely original. Its not the usual fall in love, break-up, get back together romantic comedy. Not at all. This film makes you feel good. And its smart. It recounts the 500 days of a relationship that went wrong. Its about a man who wants a woman to love him when she doesn't believe in love. How fresh is that! You might as well call this the freshest comedy ever made. I'm not kidding. I'm not exaggerating. Its totally unique. And its smart. A lot of the things in the film I have never seen before. Go rent this movie RIGHT NOW! You will be amazed and be prepared to laugh! 10 out of 10.",2010
10,"Romance movies are generally considered ""chick flicks,"" because they're usually seen from the female point of view. But ""(500) DAYS OF SUMMER"" is clearly a guy's film because it delineates all the joys and sorrows of falling in love from one young man's perspective. Remarkably, I found myself relating entirely with the main character, because back in 1980 I had also fallen for a co-worker, and she just happened to resemble Zooey Deschanel---even down to her hairstyle in this movie! And while it wasn't 500 days of her for me---more like 90 days---all the deep feelings, joys, heady romance, and ultimate disappointment as shown in this film WAS there. So now, even 3 decades later, this film was very meaningful for me. What made it even better was that it was done very creatively; kudos to all involved for their originality of script, cinematography, and editing, and of course all the players are superb in conveying the ups and downs of romance---or at least of deep love that's ultimately and disconcertingly not returned with equal fervor.",2010
10,"When the moon is in the seventh house and Jupiter aligns with Mars -- you get ""500 Days of Summer"". This is one of those rare films where everything lined up perfectly and the results are stunning. Where do you start with a movie this good? Anywhere! ",2010
2,"My 500 days of summer: @ Minute 1: some voice introduces the movie, saying that it is not a lovestory. Minute 2: I figured out that it is a lovestory. Minute 10: the movie takes a good start, promising to be something fresh, funny and original. Minute 30: It still hasn't been either fresh, funny or original. Minute 40: I'm wondering when the story is going to unfold it's plot. Minute 50: I'm realizing that this is the plot. Minute 60: I'm realizing that the movie isn't going to be fresh, funny or original. The movie is starting to get on my nerves. Minute 70: I'm thinking of walking out of the cinema. Minute 80: I know I should have. I'm walking out.",2009

1,"I went to see this film having heard a lot of good things and with an open mind, choosing it over Inglorious Basterds to see with my partner. I thought it might be a thoughtful alternative to the chick flicks she would prefer to see.",2009
1,"Why do movie and TV people insist on hiring a costume designer? Unless it is a period piece with special dress, this it totally unnecessary!!! Invariably, some chick goes overboard and runs out on Melrose to buy all the cute outfits her budget will allow. This movie is the epitome of this error. Guys in reality just do NOT put that much thought into having cute little outfits!! What planet are you people from? This guy might as well have had a Pee Wee Herman bow-tie on in every seen. No guy wears ridiculous tight vests to work every day! And all the scenes where the guy and his two buddies sit around and talk about his girlfriend Summer are just some chick writer's total fantasy!!! No guys actually do this!!! Hello????

10,I think love stories are underrated due to the fact that it's pretty predictable how they end up. The guy getting the girl at the end because it's their fate.,2013
3,"Somebody said that the film is told in an ""innovative and clever narrative style"". I wouldn't acknowledge as a big innovation a non-linear story with a voice over (copied from The Royal Tenenbaums). But I agree on the fact that this is the best part of the movie. Full of most poor clichés like the musical scene after Tom gets laid and the visit to Ikea (sorry, was that advertising?). I couldn't relate with any of the characters, too superficial, too weak. The soundtrack could be inspirational for a teenager, absolutely boring for anybody that has a minimum of knowledge of indie and alternative music. No edge, no inspiration, pure mediocrity. Camera work and photography are appreciable but can not make up for all the rest. Look around the web for other nonpartisan reviews.",2009
9,"Misfits is the story of what happens if teens who are juvenile delinquents (convicted of minor, not major crimes) get super powers. And as its a British TV show, there's more foul language, rough sex, sharp dialogue,obscenity and eccentricity than it would be if it were an American one. I watched the first one out of curiosity not expecting much, but was hooked. At first (and second and third) glance, the characters are unsympathetic. Kelly- an aggressive version of Vicky Pollard, Alisha- a sexaholic, Curtis a disgraced track star, Simon a kid so withdrawn he's heading into creepy territory, and Nathan the smart-arse whose snark makes you laugh AND want to kill him. A disparate bunch forced to do Community Service under court orders as an alternative to jail. They get superpowers from a freak storm- and then its a thrill ride all the way. Violent attacks, murder, burying bodies..from the action packed first episode its a hair raising thrill ride with some amazing music in the soundtrack. The actors are superb. This is MUST SEE TV!",2009
10,"Misfits has been described in a lot of reviews as a cross between Skins and Heroes, however, in my opinion, it doesn't contain the biggest flaws of these shows- pretentiousness or unoriginality. I'm *not* slating these shows, I'm just saying that as quite a comic-book fan, it's difficult to watch or read something about characters with superpowers without ripping it apart- getting irritated by the plot lines that are taken, or 'influenced' from other sources and neither does it have an impossibly good looking set of people living a life you can't help but envy, no matter what drama has unfolded in their life due to partying too hard. Misfits is very unique and while you can guess some plot lines of the show, you can never guess what'll happen next episode.",2009
10,Where DID this show come from? Though it's not the most original concept (freak lightning storm strikes and gives a ragtag bunch of community service workers special powers) this show rises above Heroes and the many clones by bringing enough freshness to the table. Now I'm judging this show having just watched the first two episodes. At first it looks like your average Skins type rip-off but it very quickly establishes an intriguing plot with lovable characters and unexpected twists aplenty. The script is sharp like a razor and offers laugh-out-loud moments and witticisms to rival the best episodes of Friends or Fraiser. All the misfits are perfectly cast and brilliantly acted with just the right amount of cynicism and pathos and the situations don't seem forced like Heroes often does but emerge logically and organically from the characters. Even the powers themselves extend from the character's personas. Fantastic show. I cannot recommend it enough!,2009
10,"Considering the scenario has been recently done into the ground by numerous TV shows and movies, Misfits has a surprisingly fresh take. I like the realism in the dialog countering the surreal happenings. It's the kind of show that can make you feel like you are really there or it could really happen. The characters work well together, the acting and script are well done so there is nothing awkward or difficult to follow in the face of multiple characters. Very good looks into personal realizations that make the watcher wonder how they would feel in that situation. Much attention to detail, you won't be watching the show and picking out obvious flaws that are so annoying in many shows of this genre. I simply have not found any yet. I hope to be watching for many seasons. Brilliant !",2009
10,Brilliant! People seem to refer to Heroes when talking/writing about Misfits. This isn't valid as Heroes is a very different series. Misfits is about some ordinary late-teenagers getting super powers - Heroes is about Hollywood characters receiving superpowers and saving the world by being superheroes.,2009
8,"The season begins with the crippling blow of Robert Sheehan (who played the best character, Nathan and who often gave the show some much- needed humour) leaving the show and never really recovers, stumbling along adequately but never really finding its footing, unfortunately. Regardless, Misfits' third season is a sufficiently made, enjoyable slice of science fiction comedy-drama which is always great fun to watch, albeit Joe Gilgun can't fill Sheehan's size 55 shoes and that Hitler episode was so stupid. The finale is the best out of the three until the final moments, where stuff happens and we say goodbye to Kelly (the lovable Lauren Socha), Iwan Rheon's Simon (btw, he also sucks in Vicious) and Alisha, a slutty party girl with a heart of gold (Antonia Thomas), which is too much to take. I can't watch it anymore. I may watch a compilation of Nathan's best moments on YouTube to make me feel better, however. ",2016
10,"Never have I laughed so much at a bunch of snotty, revolting weirdos who should be deserted on a remote island for the sake of the rest of us. Have just finished watching episode 6 and am dying for another series to be made. Episode 2 made me snort my tea through my nose with laughter/horror/revulsion, it was epic. ",2009
10,"I've had the good fortune of being able to watch this show online as I'm from the States. This show is brilliant and funny and deserves to be seen by viewers here too (USA). I look forward to watching the surprisingly fun and energetic cast perform some really great rolls. The cast work really well with each other and I hope that Misfits get the recognition that it deserves. Sure the effects are a bit cheesy but overall this is not what this show revolves around. It has potential to be something more but I still give it 10/10 for the originality. Comparing this show to Heroes (which obviously has large budgets and production value)is a waste of time as both shows are totally different. I found this show by accident and I'm hooked. I've told my friends to watch it and many are following me and saying that this show, despite its low budget and production value is worthy of a following.",2009
9,"I must admit that not once did I think of 'Heroes' when watching this programme, although now the point has been raised I can see why people would compare the two. What this programme does is show what a fertile ground British TV still is as not only is it very well cast, but the writing, direction and production design match anything that out US friends can do. Along with Skins and The Inbetweeners Channel 4 have now got another great programme that is 'yoof' but also appeals to an older audience. It is very dark, very twisted and quite often very very funny.",2010
10,"Science fiction shows usually suffer from poor writing and awkward acting in their first season. They take a season or two to really get warmed up. This cast just clicks from day one. It may have something to do with the age of the cast. They're young enough to take sci-fi acting seriously. Older actors tend to make it look campy. Take Doctor Who for example, or even Torchwood.",2010
10,"(I have revised my original draft) Now we are a few weeks in I have a better idea of what this show has to offer and it is now a clear 9/10. Misfits is a odd piece of obscene teenage drama mixed with a perfect example of a sci/fi dystopia. What you get is classic TV. The story follows a pack of rogue young adults ejected from society for a variety of problems, they have an armoury of asbo's and criminal offences and the majority are crass and vindictive. Yes, your average UK teen.",2009
1,"This WAS my favourite show when it first aired. Season's 1 and 2 were hilarious and I couldn't wait to watch the next episode. After the second season I heard Robert Sheehan would be leaving to pursue a movie (I believe). When I heard this I was raging. He absolutely made the show, without him its just a group of boring kids. The first thing that irritated me about the third season (other than the absence of Robert Sheehan) was the new found powers of the characters. The one girl is now a rocket scientist and Curtis can change into a girl? Sooo ridiculous! I watched the first three episodes of the third season and that was all I could handle. The plot and story line were terrible! Season 1 and 2 get a 10/10. If IMDb permitted a zero rating, this show would now deserve it. ",2012
8,"Credit is due...where credit is due In two simple words.....Pure brilliance I like to think I have a good judge of creative intelligence masked into current media. Some of you may think me a tool but for me, I know what I like. After having watched just two episodes I can say without any hindrance that this will, and is, an example of pure brilliance.",2010
7,"Sorry, but without this guy, the utmost misfit - Robert Sheehan alias Nathan Young, Misfits lost 40% value. Nathan ""vanishes"" in Las Vegas forever. This young actor I may say has earn the place among my favorite genuine, spontaneous and brilliant actors like Hugh Laurie (Dr. House). Then Antonia Thomas ( Alisha) follows Robert Sheehan and disappear taking another 15% value with her. Follows Iwan Rheon (Simon)... In my opinion, Misfits would have been one of the best TV series with young and talented actors. What I liked the most was the antagonism between Simon and Nathan - full of humor. When Naive Simon becomes Hero Simon, that was another unfortunate decision. So, making the average, 9 mark for the first 2 seasons and 5 for the later 2 ones, instead of voting a pure 9 for it, my vote will be 7.",2013
2,"The original wonderful and convincing actors were replaced by a candy cane and over sweet new cast. I find this abominable expression by actors who are so cute, trying so hard to be misfits,a sickening aftertaste of too much candy eaten all at once, so to speak. The target audience must be cutesy types wanting to be misfits so people will see them, as they are generally invisible in real life.The ratings are good, so there must be a lot of these candy cane types watching this show, and taking their piggy bank money to buys things that remind them of it, at toys are us. It is sad to see such an original show as this one, turned over to the gold fish, cute doggy owner types out there, and their dogs named spot. I am so disappointed at this new rendition of terrible trash that is supposed to look real and inviting, only to come out looking sad and shabby. It's like turning the Munsters into Hansel and Gretal.Any moment I expect a loving grandmother come on the show with a baking pan disguised as a lethal weapon. Terrible terrible show these days. Maybe the writers will try and get people out there like me who don't own piggy banks to watch this again. I doubt that, but they do say pigs fly sometimes when you're not looking.",2012
7,"Series 1 and 2 of Misfits are outrageous and far more entertaining than the synopsis suggests. The production values are sky high, and it can do horror and thrills as well as almost any other TV programme. Much more importantly though, it surprised me... because it made me roar with laughter. The credit for that goes almost exclusively to Nathan, who takes one look at all the cool haircuts and pouts before tearing it all apart with filthy sociopathic charm. He leaves at the end of Series 2, and the show misses him badly. Rudy tries to fill the hole, but he is increasingly alone in trying to provide some charisma and laughs. By Series 4, the characters who populate the show have become entirely forgettable. Get in, get your fill, then get out while you're ahead.",2013
3,When I started watching this show I did not know at all what this is about. I had no idea that it is about the anti-hero or super heroes who can get after the storm.,2013
7,"Season 1 and 2 they are really good. I just couldn't stop watching. But the seasons after these I didn't like them at all. They are really bad. It was nice watching Joseph Gilgun playing in the misfits cause he is a really good actor but the screenplay was horrible. I don't know why most of the series the just going downhill after second season usually. The same was with the series ""Heroes"". Misfits the same, season 1 and 2 I was thinking WOW, and then 3rd and 4th season I was bored to watch a full episode cause they screen was stupid and also they had destroyed the awesomeness of every character. I just watched them cause I thought it maybe become better but it didn't. I am not going to watch 5th season that's for sure. Anyway that is just my opinion. It's hard to vote for this series cause it goes from a 10 to a 5 after the 2nd season.",2013
1,"Well, it can't get any simpler than that. Since the point where Nathan left the show it's been going downhill day after day. I need to point out that I was really enjoying this show till that point. In my humble opinion, Nathan gave life to this show. He was the glue putting all the other characters together. When the show started, it was REALLY promising, and really kept the viewer. But since the end of the second season (Nathan's departure) I just feel like I am watching a different show. It is really awful since then. In case you are wondering why do I still watch it, I just hope that there will be an episode (besides ""Vegas baby"") that I'll be able to see Nathan again. Just to make it clear. I really think that this show could be great.",2012
5,Misfits started out...STRONG! I was hooked instantly! But....like Heroes....they started killing off key people....and taking powers!,2011
7,"One of the most gripping shows I've watched in years, though i can see why people are quick to point out the similarities to shows like Heroes, its very far removed. The characters are a lot darker and proud of it which brings a completely different show to the viewer than just a Superhero like show.",2011
2,"i've never seen a show deteriorate so quickly. Joseph Gilgun is such an unlikeable character I can barely watch him. I wonder if the writers/producers took the upfront money and went on a K-trip. What had been a very tight show has dripped down to drivel. Too bad. I suspect the cast changes are $ related, but they have missed the mark. I suspect Johnny Vegas will be on next year.",2012

8,"Just came from a sneak preview held in Baltimore and left the theater feeling very satisfied. You don't normally find a late September movie as good as ""Zombieland"" was. After dropping you in the action right from the start, the movie keeps coming with constant laughs and good action. There were not a lot of scares in the movie, other than the few obvious scenes where you could see one coming, but horror is not what the director was going for in this film. Laughs, however, come often and from many different directions. Jessie Eisenberg's nerdy, insecure 'Columbus' character and Woody Harrelson's redneck zombie-killing 'Tallahassee' play very well off each other and provide plenty of memorable moments. Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin are also solid throughout. There is also one unforgettable cameo that had most of the audience rolling in the aisles. The film has a simple, easy to follow storyline that does not provoke a lot of questions. Indeed, if you go to this movie expecting a lot of plot twists and surprises, you're going to be severely disappointed. There is however, good action, good laughs, and plenty of zombie related gore. At about 90 minutes long, it does not drag on and gets to the predictable but satisfying ending, going out in style. There will no doubt be a lot of comparisons to ""Shaun of the Dead"", which is nothing to be ashamed of, but this is truly a one of a kind movie experience that holds its own with any not only any zombie movie in recent memory, but with any comedy so far this year. As long as you don't go into this movie expecting too much, you'll get your money's worth. Well done.",2009
9,"Arguably one of the finest horror comedies of all time is Edgar Wright's Shaun of the Dead, and since its release in '04, there have been a good number of wannabes. Based on the trailers for Zombieland, however, I thought that the film had some serious potential to match Shaun in terms of quality, possibly even usurp it. Having seen the film, I'm happy to say that Zombieland does just that.",2009
9,I caught a sneak preview of Zombieland with a friend and was impressed to say the least.,2009
7,"I just was exiting the theater after seeing '9', which is also worth a look, when my friend and I were offered tickets to a preview screening of Zombieland, which began almost immediately. I had seen previews for this picture, but I'd say this exceeded my expectations, which isn't to say masterpiece, but it was certainly entertaining, and at about 90 minutes, didn't really overstay it's welcome. ",2009
8,"The name Zombieland conjures up a vision of a zombie-themed amusement park -- and that's exactly what this film is. Visually stylish and the most laughs I've had at the movies in a long time. A really solid script and nice underlying story really helps make this so much more than just a bunch of awesome zombie kills. That being said, this film feels as if you're playing a really badass zombie killing video game.",2009

Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) is a young geek who has a lot of phobias about almost everything from clowns, to bathrooms, to checking the back seat of cars. Being alone and scared of the outside world has kept him alive. His new fear is being eaten by zombies. To survive, Columbus has begun making a long list of rules to survive. Each time he gives you one of his rules, you see an example of his rule in action. He decides to go home to Columbus to see if his parents are still alive. Along the highway, he meets Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) a redneck zombie killer who loves Twinkies. They team up and head for Tallahassee. On the way they meet and join forces with two girls, Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abagail Breslin). They may be the last surviving people on earth, and they must rely on each other to survive.",2009
5,"If you fancy watching a film about Zombies then something called ""Zombieland"" would feel like the best course of action. Unfortunately though Zombieland is very far from the rom-zom-com it's emulating, i.e. Shaun of the Dead. Shaun of the Dead had a great love and affection for this genre and played to it beautifully, interweaving sharp comedy with drama. Zombieland attempts this but ends up being a teen road movie that just happens to be set after the zombie apocalypse and I did not want to see a teen road movie. Don't get me wrong there are some good moments and the film starts off quite promising. However after Columbus (Eisenberg)and Tallehasse (Harrelson) meet the two girls it's begins to lose it's shine. The real problem with this film though is the poor writing. For a start the two girls are instantly unlikeable and the sudden attraction Columbus has for Wichita seem tacked on. Tallahasee's search for Twinkie (think thats how you spell it, I'm British so they're not well known over here) screams of smack you in the face product placement. Then there's the plot holes, oh so many plot holes... 1 - How did the girls manage to get past the zombies in the supermarket when they immediately noticed Columbus and Tallahasse? 2 - Why did the girls hide in the back of the supermarket on the extreme off chance that someone not zombie-fied would stumble upon them? 3 - Why bother conning the guys out of their car and weapons when there's millions of cars and guns just lying around? 4 - The amusement park was meant to be zombie free so why smash open the gate with the car to get in, thereby paving the way for zombies to enter? 5 - Since it's shown that zombies can easily climb why did the girls think a paltry 6 foot wooden fence surrounding the park would hold them back? 6 - Correct me if I'm wrong but if you live in a world over-run with homicidal, flesh eating zombies then surely you'd want to keep a low profile? Why then when you finally get to this supposed zombie free amusement park would you turn all the power on, lighting the place up like a Christmas tree? 7 - How did they manage to get on and off the boat ride without someone else to start and stop it? 8 - Why go on the ride that shoots you straight up to avoid the zombies when you know it'll immediately come back down? 9 - And finally, who's running all the power stations? Everything seems to be working without any problem. You can watch TV, pump petrol, even start up an entire amusement park yet surely the power would be the first thing to go?",2009
8,"This film was a fun ride all the way through. It's lack of scariness(non existent) and *GASP!* gore is more than made up for with the constant flow of hilarity and likable characters. This is by far the optimist's zombie film, as the way things play out are definitely different than any one thats come before it(definitely not a Romero flick, though I think his Land of the Dead actually is second place in this regard). It has a sleek, very modern sense of style-just watch for how each rule makes it's appearance/reappearance and a good message on the importance of others in the worst of times. I recommend this to anybody who has a remote interest in comedies, zombie/end of the world flicks, or just having a good time at the theater, and look forward to seeing it again when it comes out.",2009

8,"I mean come on, who doesn't think about what they would do if zombies took over the world. Its a fun, yet serious question to think about. Most movies have it right, by taking the serious side of things. But what if we take a video game approach and just run around killing everyone of them? Uh.......you can more than sign me up for this one. OK, lets face the honest question.......if your some little prissy girl who does not like or does not appreciate zombie films.......then this is the wrong movie for you. This movie takes everything you have learned from all those movies, and puts a comedic spin on it. I mean come on, a zombie stripper wearing nipple tasles running in slow motion.....how could anyone not want to see that? The movie is very basic in its groundwork, but excels in its humor and character drive. Woody is basically a zombie film buff's wet dream. A hoosier red neck who wants to just kill zombies for the rest of his life. Now i must admit, towards the middle of the movie, it almost felt like they weren't focusing on the whole zombie aspect that much........mainly because they were adding a little depth to each of the characters. But rest assured, by the end, it totally quenches your thirst. But through all the hilarious dialogue and funny little zombie killing sequences, the best part of the movie was hands down the cameo. Now if you have not heard who it is by now, im not going to say it........but it is almost genius, and probably the best cameo ever created, and i will stand by that 100%. Trust me, it is that funny. Bottom Line.......i know i love zombie movies, and i might seem a little bias........but damnit, this movie is easily the best comedy of the year. It was the perfect mix of humor and gore........not only that, the story was pretty decent, and very entertaining to watch unfold. This movie is seriously like a fun house at the carnival. It will easily be accepted by the zombie lover crowd, and the general population. This movie is easily one of the 10 best i have seen so far this year.

4,"I watched it today on the insistence of many other zombie film fans that stated it was somehow 'one of the best, if not the best zombie film' and definitely feel cheated during and after watching. Which can only lead me to say, that it's highly overrated.",2015
3,"I didn't go into this film with particularly high expectations, but I did expect this film to be watchable at the very least due to its current IDMB rating of 7.7 and a metascore rating of 73. Sadly, I've found myself to be disappointed again.",2013
5,"SPOILER ALERT I'll make this review very simple and to the point. Zombieland may be a decently funny movie, but it doesn't have too many parts that make me want to rewind and rewatch them because they are THAT funny. To me, it was a one time watch and move on with your life. It was a forgettable movie experience, which is a shame because I wanted it to be so much more than that, since I had heard it was the counter to Shaun of the Dead (which I love to death).",2013
1,"Comparing to this thing all spaghetti zombie movies are real pieces of art. Their behavior is completely random: they steel cars when there are plenty of cars around, waste ammo for unknown reason and generally behave like they were 6 years old. This what Bill Murray presented was incredibly stupid: he tried to pretend to be a zombie in eyes of an armed man fur completely no reason. What is the most crazy is that one of the characters is traveling America looking for some kind of candy., two girls are going through half of continent to visit some adventure park and when they got there of course they have to ask for attention of all zombies around. I cannot understand how bunch or total idiots like this could be last survivals of zombie infested continent. Moreover this movie is not funny at all.",2009
10,"While book racks are brimming with thought provoking, high concept science fiction, the movie genre tends to be populated by invading aliens, intergalactic wars, and adventure, which makes Director and co-writer Duncan Jones' Moon that much more of an oddity.",2009
10,"In short, this is one of the best sci-fi movies I have seen in a LONG time. Sam Rockwell plays it perfect, making the viewer feel his isolation and lonelieness. For a low budget film, the few effect shots work seamlessly. I'm trying to remain spoiler free, so I won't bother to explain the plot. If you like older and more story/character driven sci-fi, such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, than chances are you will love this movie. If you aren't a huge fan of sci-fi, take a chance with this one. You may find it a very rewarding experience. I loved this movie, and I can't stop thinking about it. In Moon, you may begin to think that everything is a big cliché, but than with all of the seemingly cliché plot points, Moon changes them into something entirely original and unexpected. It is an excellent piece of art and I have a strong feeling not enough people will see and appreciate it like I did.",2009
9,"The Moon has always been a source of wonder and mystery. It is so far away, yet much closer than the stars. Man has reached the Moon, but there is still so much that is unknown about it. It is a bridge between mystery and fact, and director Duncan Jones uses it as a brilliant setting for his science fiction film Moon.",2009
10,Go see this movie! I've been lucky enough to have an opportunity to see this movie down here at SXSW and I am the better for it.,2009
10,"I attended a screening of ""Moon"" at the 2009 SXSW Film Festival in the  legendary Paramount Theatre. There wasn't an empty seat in the  1300-capacity palace. Directed by Duncan Jones, ""Moon"" stars Sam  Rockwell, one of our generation's most powerful actors.  The notion of a film being unique seems unlikely in 2009. Not here.  While ""Moon"" is a modern-day science fiction film set in the future, it  pays homage to recent classics like ""Blade Runner"" and ""Alien."" Viewers  will be dazzled -- fans of the genre will nod in approval.  Science has developed a way to mine the rocks of the moon for clean  energy here on earth. Private enterprise, in the form of a corporation, sends astronauts on a three-year work stint to carry out  this ongoing mission. Sam Bell (Rockwell) is the latest to undertake  this task, with the trusted robot GERTY by his side watching over the  base's operations -- think HAL with a heart. Of course, things are not  what they seem, and the viewer is mesmerized as puzzling and surprising  events unfold.  Cinematographer Gary Shaw contributes to the impression of the eerie  stillness of life on the moon with the copious use of still camera and  slow tracking shots, only using hand-held when necessary. Nicolas  Gaster's editing is sure and steady, emphasizing the slow pace of Sam  Bell's multi-year work assignment. Remember those pre-CGI days when  special effects meant miniature land rovers on a bumpy table? It can  still be done -- and be believable. ""Moon"" is evocative of the sci-fi  greats whose visuals were done in-camera, i.e., on set as opposed to  being created by computers in post-production. Sam Bell's unearthly  home is comfortable yet aging like the patina of an old cottage.  Nathan Parker's screenplay (Jones wrote the story but handed over  screen writing duties to Parker) makes the most of Sam Rockwell's  considerable talents. This was quite a physically demanding role, as  well, and rarely has the actor been better (watch ""Snow Angels,""  though). He doesn't just carry the film -- ""Moon"" is almost a one-man  show and Rockwell conducts a master class.  ""Moon"" is a classic, down and dirty (literally) science fiction film  with a baffling mystery that challenges the viewer to live in the shoes  of the protagonist. It's hard to imagine a better one than Sam Rockwell  or a more effective, entertaining, and satisfying cinematic experience.",2009
10,"This was the best movie I have seen in a very in a very long time and immediately jumps into my favorite movies ever. MOON puts a relatable human touch on an intriguing and deep sci-fi story that, while it originally appears to be taking the path of 2001 Space Odyssey, is a unique adventure. Sam Rockwell puts on a spellbinding performance and Kevin Spacey's GERTY voice-over is eery and excellent. I have never seen a movie that had me so engrossed and intrigued from beginning to end. Some may say the film starts slowly but I found the first half hour to be an important and gripping portrayal of what it would mean to be alone in space, without which the movie would not be as effective. I don't want to ruin the plot so I wont go into further detail. As an avid movie watcher who is not a sci-fi buff I would recommend this movie to anybody who wants to see a movie that will take over their lives for 2 hours and have you leave the theater wanting to do nothing but discuss how beautifully layered it was.",2009
10,"Okay, here's the basic plot (without the twist-spoiler):",2009
8,"I was led to this movie, partly because of a sort of dissatisfaction from what we've known as science fiction due to Star-Treks, Star wars, terminators and transformers. On my visit to the local independent movie theater, I was only expecting something like Apollo 13 and I would've been satisfied with just that.",2009
7,"Originally posted to titsandgore.com, April 2009:",2009
9,"Directed by David Bowie's 38-year-old son (formerly known as Zowie), with a screenplay by Nathan Parker, 'Moon' is a curious and thought-provoking sci-fi story about a man working for an energy company, mining Helium-3 on the far side of the moon, who discovers, just as his three-year contract is ending, that he may not be going home. Sam Rockwell gets to do a virtuoso turn as alternative versions of himself (his character's name is Sam too, Sam Bell). Events are set in a traditional space station with a capacious, softly lit layout featuring the obligatory human-voiced and omnipresent computer -- mobile, not so big, a sort of clunky R2D2 -- creepily accommodating and voiced by an almost-human Kevin Spacey. It's a robot, I guess, and its name is GERTY. There are nice lunar landscapes outside where Sam sometimes rides around in a puffed-up Hummer-style Land Rover to explore or look over the machinery extracting Helium-3. Instead of the now all-too-usual and increasingly irrelevant CGI, there's more the feel of a giant mock-up in everything we see, which provides a better kind of background for what is essentially a Kafkaesque head trip. The interior isn't all modernistic chill. There's also a funky armchair reminiscent of the final sequence of '2001,' and cozy junk, even a college pennant, on the wall around Sam's bunk, sort of like a frat boy's quarters. Sam Rockwell's own appearance, his skin far from perfect and his expression a bit wacko, suggests an ordinary guy, just a worker, which is what he is, not some Astronaut.",2009
9,"Moon is a philosophical film at heart, examining a variety of complex subjects and dilemmas with a precise and perfect manner, mirroring the voice of its robot servant Gerty and the emptiness of the base itself. This is both the source of its beauty and a few problems.",2009
9,I saw this last night and it was fabulous. It's hard to discuss for fear of giving away any spoilers but I'll try.,2009
10,"Moon is ostensibly a one-man show featuring Sam Rockwell as an astronaut sent to the moon on a three-year contract to maintain a mining station that harvests the sun's fusion energy from moonrocks. We are thrown into the mix with only two weeks left in his tenure, the desire to return to his wife and daughter, whom he has never seen in real life yet, strong and his psyche all but ready to break from the lack of human interaction. Sam Bell has been keeping busy by utilizing a treadmill, watching old Nick at Nite type sitcoms, whittling away at a wooden model of his hometown with an X-acto knife, and conversing with the station's artificial intelligence GERTY. The live feed to Earth has been disengaged for a while now, leaving this monotonous voice and bright yellow smiley face—complete with changing expressions—of Kevin Spacey his only friend. Sure he gets to record video packages for his wife and bosses at Lunar Industries, and they reply back to him, but the distance needed to travel is great and the time between too long.",2009

9,The future can be bright and the future can be bleak. It's an area that has always offered writers and filmmakers have often looked at and brought us some real classics. Here is Duncan Jones' homage to the great era of Sci-fi from of the 60s to the 80s.,2009
8,"The Sci-Fi department is a very hard market to break. Hence why greatness always seems to come from that genre......because normally when they are made, it usually takes millions of dollars to cover the special effects and what not......so the process of choosing the right script is somewhat limited, but they always leave their mark. However, this one is changing that pace.....in a rhealm of big budget Star Wars and Battlestar Galactica flicks, this movie chooses to take the independent route. By only spending 3 million for its budget, and using old school techniques for its special effects.....can a movie like this thrive in todays market? Well you know how i mentioned that the script selection for a Sci-Fi movie isa very tough market to break......and how the script better be incredible if it is going to make it anywhere........well this movie is just that. This movie was just plain brilliant. For those of you who have no idea what this film is about, allow me to shed some light on the subject.........In the future, our main character Sam Rockwell is living on a one man space station on the moon, whose should purpose it to retrieve and send precious resources from the moon back to the earth.....in this process he becomes very lonely and begins to uncover a horrible truth. The movie is directed and told in such a brilliant fashion......they never try to WOW you with its special effects, which are very moderate but pass with flying colors. Its script and method of storytelling are probably the best part. Instead of answering all of your questions all at once, they sort of draw them out and make you claw and scratch for the truth......but the thing that i like the most is how they approach everything.........they take a route that lets you know that you have seen all the other Sci-Fi classics, and addresses all of your concerns of what may happen or what is going to......and then just carries on like its hidding this secret from you.....almost like the movie knows what your thinking, but chooses not to correct you right away.......brilliantly told and shown in an even better light......and with Clint Mansell directing the musical score(Requiem for a Dream, The Fountain)......my god, how could you not be pulled in. Now the part that i am excited to talk about the most is the acting......because i really have not had anything to rave about so far this year.......but Sam Rockwell is hands down the best actor so far this year. He has already proved himself to me with ""The Green Mile"", ""Frost/Nixon"", and ""Choke""......but he knocked this one out of the park. It was a difficult script to pull off for an actor, and he did it with leaps and bounds.......job well done. I will be very upset if he is not at least nominated this year. Bottom Line.......well, ""Star Trek"" gave you the action/entertainment portion of your Sci-Fi.......whereas this one gives you its underbelly. This is easily one of the best Sci-Fi movies i have seen in a long time, and that is saying a lot coming from me. There was not one thing wrong with this movie......maybe the end was a little sketchy, but it was still not enough to destroy this brilliant film. I urge all of you to go to your local independent movie theatre and watch this movie........you will regret it if you don't.......easily one of the 10 best movies i have seen this year.",2009
9,"The most important issue we may face in the future is whether rapid advances in science and technology will change human beings into disposable resources, utilitarian subjects manipulated by indifferent centers of corporate power. Moon, the thought provoking and thoroughly engrossing first feature from U.K. director Duncan Jones, son of the pop singer David Bowie, tackles these questions and raises others that have been pondered since man first set foot on this planet – Who are we? Where did we come from? What is our purpose on this planet? Though the answers do not come as easily as the questions, Moon attempts to recapture the science fiction genre from the mindless action-adventure films we have become accustomed to and brings it to a level, perhaps not seen since the classic Kubrick film 2001.",2009
9,Interesting and worthy film but ultimately unsatisfying. I love sci-fi films especially budget indies and I would like to rate the film higher but unfortunately it wasn't for me.,2009
9,"I have just seen Moon at my local independent cinema after it was mentioned that it won Best New British Feature at the Edinburgh International Film Festival. To be honest I did not read much into the film before I went but must admit I was totally blown away. This is a LOW budget film, I think about £5 million and it is amazing the overall results achieved from such a low budget. ",2009
9,"Wow! This movie blew me away! I really didn't expect it to be as good as it was. I really enjoyed following the story and seeing how it all played out. I wish it was even longer or they made a part 2! It had a slight Blade Runner or Alien feel to it which the director, Duncan Jones, states. I heard MUTE will have more of this feeling so I'm really looking forward to that film. Now some people state that it was too slow paced. Maybe it's just me, but I found that enjoyable, and helped for the unexpected mysteries which lied within. Sam Rockwell played Sam Bell perfectly too. He deserves a lot of credit for nailing that character. It's like you're just following him on his journey trying to figure out and put the pieces together on what is really going on in his world. And, what a unique and fascinating world it is! I also enjoyed Kevin Spacey as the voice of ""Gerty"". What else can I say without giving it away except watch it! Hopefully you'll be as pleasantly surprised as I was!",2009
9,Sam Rockwell.,2009
9,"I liked it. The piano music played throughout kept the tone of the movie from becoming too sterile, lonely. This movie displays some dull life on the moon. The piano music will pull your heart strings alittle, keeping you in there. The moon scenes are very realistic looking. ",2009

10,"This movie is all-around great. Easily my favorite Sam Rockwell performance, with him pulling off every emotion needed in a very convincing way. He really seems like he's been alone on the moon for 3 years. When compared to something like Matt Damon in The Martian, the difference is staggering. Spacey as GERTY is also a nice bonus.",2016

I don't think it's offensive at all. Just because we don't feel like we relate to a character doesn't mean that they are offensive. I'm from Texas. Have you ever seen how they portray us on television. They act like we are all how do I put this, ""Big ol' country bumpkins that say ya'll every other word and wear cowboy hats and belt buckles as large as our state, and that every word we say has to have some southern twang to it"". It's a television show. It's funny. For once can we just let one show survive at least one season. I've already lost Lipstick Jungle and Samantha Who.",2009

Being able to see Busy Phillips in HD on a weekly basis ain't to shabby either but she also earns her comedy chops along side Courtney Cox who is HIGHlarious. Its like Monica Geller, divorced and on the prowl. Im not mad at that. And Christa Miller entertains on any show she is on. It seems as if every person playing on it and everyone behind the scenes working on this show fits perfectly within it. From the jokes to the actors and actresses to the writers directors camera guys editors anybody that works on the show works well in the best oiled sitcom machine since My Name is Earl. Watch it and be entertained.",2010

The sexual humor is tasteless, but makes you realize where the sense of humor is going and society accepting all this. The sex humor is vague enough to keep kids at a distance and I think that is what keep the moral hypocrites at a distance!! I can see this show going at least one season if the Pilot is any indication. Very Funny Show!!",2009

1,"Sometimes it takes a show more than a few episodes to get into it's stride and achieve a consistent tone and feel, but Cougar Town is not one of them. This train wreck hit shrill-crass-and-manic in it's very first episode and to date, nearing the end of the season, has been consistently true to form. In the pilot episode the lead character asks ""Why don't you laugh at my jokes?"", to which the spot-on on screen response is ""Because they make me sad"". About half way through the most recent episode, another character wearily asks ""Does this story go on much longer?"" Unfortunately, each of these accurately sums up what most of the audience will feel a few minutes into any given episode of this stinker.",2010
1,"I'm an American living in Brazil and I've been catching up on TV shows. I thought Cougar Town looked interesting enough and took a chance on getting all the episodes. I made it through about 5 of them (hoping it would get better) but finally gave up and deleted the entire season. I found it totally boring, stupid, and insulting to anyone with any intelligence. The characters and situations are shallow and their jokes are just not funny. I tired of the sarcasm between the 3 main female characters, totally disliked the wimpy neighbor who couldn't stand up to his wife, and the ex-husband who drives around a golf cart and lives on a boat in a yard is just plain silly. I decided not to waste my time on the show any more.",2010
1,"I caught up with the Cougar Town premiere online and thought it was absolutely terrible. The best words I have to describe this raunchy and demeaning show are desperate, pathetic and insulting.

1,"I have nothing much to say about this sitcom , but i can say it was one of the most painful experiences of my life. I didn't watch the whole show, only the first 5 episodes and it was bad. In one episode it made me laugh once, maybe twice. For me, a comedy show must be hilarious all the time, not only for 2 moments per episode. This is just a sad attempt to be funny.",2012
2,"The start was relatively OK, but had soon turned into a cliché already seen in the shows dedicated to suburban life. As if Courtney Cox's character was not played badly enough, the latest ""Friends"" addition, Jennifer Aniston, was totally miscast in the role of the psychiatrist. I somehow managed to survive one season, hoping that some improvement was on the way, but to no avail. The male characters are somewhat better and more entertaining, but unless some additional characters are added, the current ones are sucked dry. The plot is practically completely revealed, and hardly any improvement could be expected. Therefore, I am ""canceling"" the show. This one is not worth watching.",2010
7,"It's a new show; it's still got some kinks to work out, and I don't completely disagree with any of the previous reviews. The characters aren't well developed (yet), and, yes, some of them are essentially caricatures, especially the promiscuous male neighbor.",2009
1,"Let me first say this: Courtney Cox is one of the most beautiful women on the Planet Earth. Having said that, Cougar Town is a rancid little piece of swill that is a huge failure in taste for all concerned. The basic premise--that the beauteous and desirable Cox has a hard time dating, is ludicrous on the surface. That her character is a whiny neurotic and a horribly manipulative and needy mother surrounded by loathsome friends (who can forget the hilarious episode where they all pushed her to go back to drinking heavily for their sake.) is, needless to say, not a selling point in a comedy. I drop in from time to time to see if Cox is in her undies, then I break for cable TV.",2010

Since I'm not a fan of sitcoms anymore, I didn't expect much more than a laugh or two max. Surprise, surprise...I've fallen in love. Fun show, witty, well cast and well written. Sort of ""Friends"" all grown up with a modern twist. The biggest surprise for me was the totally relatable story lines. As a 41 year old woman who's been married for 18 years, I can totally connect to a lot of this stuff. Or what friends are going through. Divorce, babies in your 40's, kids off to college, wine drinking, job changes, infant-like friends, trying to stay 'young' when you have so many responsibilities. But the story stays hilarious while also dealing with some actual issues. Great time was had by all. I quickly grabbed Season 2 and am now ready and rarin' for a brand new season. Thanks Cougar Town!

1,"Wow! What a sad twist on the usual network television comedy. Instead of a likable protagonist Courtney Cox plays a despicable mother who blithely humiliates her son for laughs. She blames her deplorable self image on her age bringing back the myth that woman over 40 are um, over; but the watcher has to wonder if her back story mother was equally as hideous as Courtney causing her to be a total idiot and I mean that is most literal way. It's disorienting to see this lowest of low brow comedy take place in a nice suburban neighborhood instead of a trailer park. My image of Courtney Cox as a smart funny woman is forever damaged. Is she really as stupid as one would imagine to be involved in this excruciatingly painful series or does she just think that the television watching public is brain dead and she can make a bundle off them. I'm hoping for a speedy cancellation so this series' relentless stereotyping will stop.

We had the whole memory of Voldemort's family - really quite crucial to the seventh book - and the memories of Voldemort finding the other Hogwarts founder items to use as Horcruxes. We had Bill and Fleur's relationship. We had Tonks's depression and patronus change, which led to Tonks and Remus's relationship. We had lots of interaction and conflict between Harry's house elves. We have Snape's constant suspicion of Harry. We have the complications with Madame Rosmerta.

However, I still had tickets to go see it this afternoon. I certainly did not want to sit there for another 2 hours hating it so I had to find a way to like it. I really, really wanted to like this movie. I love HP, afterall! I decided to try another approach, to watch the movie without thinking of the book at all. And I'll be da*ned if it didn't work! I realized that I had spent so much time picking apart what the movie DID NOT have, that I never allowed myself to enjoy what it DID have. Once I did that, and accepted that this movie is merely ""based on"" the book, I was able to enjoy it! Suddenly, the love story did not seem to dominate as much as it did on my first viewing.....Honestly, I never really thought that changing the way I approached the movie would work, but it did. So, if your a really big fan of the books and cd's, and you really want to find some way to enjoy this movie, I suggest you leave all the knowledge you have of the books at home, sit back, and watch! ",2009
1,"I consider myself a Harry Potter fan. Not of the movies, but from the books which they came from. There's a reason why each of J.K. Rowling's 7 books have brought much fan base all over the world, it's because of the magic of the Harry Potter books.",2009
1,"There's less of magic and tricks in the sixth instalment of the Harry Potter series, fans need be disappointed -- it offers a heavy dose of drama, romance and humour rather than the plot. ",2009

4,"Let me start by saying, I know that you have to alter and omit scenes from a novel when adapting it to the silver screen. However, it is not necessary to take a chain saw to what can easily be debated as the best book in the series. Half-Blood Prince is key to setting up the final, now two, movies and this version missed the mark. Now the major novel plot points are there, Harry learns about Voldemort's past, Draco struggles with his chosen task and Snape does kill Dumbledore but much of the set-up plot and subplots have been completely omitted. For fans out there that have read the book will get a strange feeling in their gut just a few minutes in.",2009
1,This movie was an extreme let down. One has to have read the book in order to pull together the huge holes in this movie. The climax... there was none. Why... all of a sudden .. where those people in Hogwarts? There was no building up to it...,2009

6,"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince flat out sucks! It has very little redeeming factors to it, its too long and its boring. I will never understand how the filmmakers turned what was actually an okay book into a film this boring. I read the Half-Blood Prince book, and I actually liked it. I liked the dark turn the books had taken (before f*****g it up with the Deathly Hallows), and the death of Dumbledore was actually dramatic and actually elicited an emotional response from me. It wasn't a great book, I felt that the plot delved a bit too deep into the relationships amongst the characters (or was that the Order of the Phoenix? Either way it slowed things down), and I also didn't really find the book that exciting until the ending, that is where things got good. The movie, on the other hand, was the complete opposite. Things did not get good towards the end, if anything, it got worse! The Half-Blood Prince is what happens when a book that had so much background to it that when turned into a film, the filmmakers need to keep things moving while still telling a good story and have it exciting. This movie didn't do that at all. It was boring, from beginning to end, nothing but boring, dreadfully slow scenes that nearly put me to sleep. Not only that, but the many scenes regarding the relationships were so bad that I didn't feel that the characters didn't actually like each other, the only reason they do is because the plot requires them too. For example: Ginny Weasley is supposedly going to be Harry Potter's girlfriend, but her character is so bland and the actress didn't really do a good enough job to make it look like she actually did like Harry. She stares at him with an uninterested look in her eyes, one that says to me, ""Why does the script require me to fall for this guy?"" Its painful to watch, and only serves to kill 5 minutes.",2010
2,"The movies starts out with Harry visiting the Weasley's, where he's attacked by Death eaters. They play around with some fire and some bad special effects, burn the house and runs away. Probably the best scene in the film. The next 2 hours, the film focuses 100% on Potter wanting the Weasley girl, but she's dating someone else, and Granger wanting Ron Weasley, but he's dating a weirdo, and everybody starts hating each other cause they all love each other. I do not know how it's possible to destroy the entire concept of Harry Potter and the magic world and having it made in to a teen movie where the people who're in love with each other can't say it cause they're too immature, but they succeeded doing it! I sat there for hours, wishing for the movie to end so I could do something less stupid with my time.",2009
2,"I agree with several others.... Did the director even READ the book? Does he know what a book is?? Look, Hollywood, you take a great book and make a film out of it for one reason alone: you want fans of the book to come see their favorite story come to life.",2009
2,"This is a good movie... if you haven't read any of the books. While visually, the effects were great, they were about ALL that carried the movie. In fact, there was very little of the original storyline from the book.",2009
1,"i thought i went to see harry potter and the half blood prince but the whole time i was wondering what book it was based off of be there weren't many similarities. more like the writers got lazy and only read the cliff notes. how did jk rowling allow this crap. i mean ginny did not hide the book...that will mess up movie seven. and why is there not an epic fight scene. that is the biggest part of the book. and where is harry's invisibility cloak? i don't expect the movie to include everything in the book, but i do expect it not to add things that aren't needed (the scene at the burrow) and leave out key points. or change how scenes were. why couldn't they show harry and ginny kissing in the common room? and at the first of the movie ginny was dating someone else...it never tells that they break up then she is kissing harry. umm...wtf.",2009
3,"OK....As a big Harry Potter fan i waited for the movie....scheduled to release in November, i was disappointed to see the movie release delayed for 6 months. i waited and waited and then the day it was released in India, i went to see it. I had high anticipations from the movie after seeing its trailers which were really looking good. Even after the poor attempt of David Yates at the fifth part, i was hopeful that he would do justice to the best book in the Harry Potter series but i was wrong!!!! First the good points of the movie. The special effects and the visuals were really stunning and high quality. Dan and others acted really well and it was nice to see Ginny having a meaty role in the movie. She looks gorgeous. The Scenes at Lake were really upto the mark. We had some nice comic moments well enacted by Dan and Rupert. But let me ask...is that the reason one goes to see a Harry Potter movie?? I didn't go to see a teenage romantic comedy. The tagline of the movie says that Harry and Dumbledore try to unravel Voldemort's past and the time we actually get to see his past in only 10 minutes in a damn 2:30 hours movie!!!! The durseleys were totally left out. So were Bill and Fleur. Hagrid got only two scenes in the whole movie.",2009
9,"I was lucky enough to see a preview of Half-Blood Prince three days before opening day. I saw it a second time with my son who is not quite ten, but who is generally mature for his age and doesn't scare easily. The two viewings give me the unique advantage of both the adult and the child perspective on the movie. ",2009
1,"The whole movie was about love connections. The producers and script writers hardly followed the book, just mostly changing things to their likeing. Ill admit there were some good funny parts, but that doesn't excuse the fact that how awful it was. After watching 3/4's of the film i was ready to fall asleep, and finally when the end comes.. when the best fighting is supposed to come! i get disappointed as the skip through all of it.. So i advise everyone to save their time and money and wait maybe for a rental. Its a little to late for me since i wasted my money and wont get the 2 hrs of my life back..",2009
6,"Well, if I could split the movie into two, I would say that the first half is a superb Proposal and the second half is fairly traditional Hollywood pablum. In the first half, the wonderful comedic timing and chemistry between Bullock and Reynolds was terrific. The writing was first-rate intellectual, snappy sparring, even throwing in some literary references in the put-downs. Kudos to the Director, Anne Fletcher, and the Screenwriter, Pete Chiarelli.",2009
7,"Although the movie is predictable, like most romance comedies are, nevertheless it was sweet. Sure a bit unrealistic in terms of the time line of the whole plot takes place but this is why we have movies like this, so you can escape into the fantasy of romance and humor. If you are looking for realism then watch a 3 hour drama, but if you want to escape for awhile and just enjoy a movie you don't have to think too much about then it's worth your time. If you don't want to pay to go see it in the theater, then wait for it to come out on DVD. I saw it during a private screening as part of the ATL Film Festival, for close to two hours I thought of nothing else and laughed and even cried a bit. I would definitely see it again. It may not be the best romantic comedy I have seen but the movie still holds lots of charm.",2009
7,"The Proposal isn't going to win any Oscars, nor will it become your favourite movie of all time. However, it does exactly what it is supposed to do; that is to entertain you. The Proposal is the story of a tough editor Margaret Tate (Bullock) who forces her assistant Andrew Tate (Ryan Reynolds) to marry her so she can stay in the U.S. (Interestingly, in the movie Bullock plays a Canadian and Reynolds an American while in real life, the reverse is true). What happens next will not surprise viewers but they will get many laughs along the way. Reynolds and Bullocks are very funny and also very believable. Betty White (from the Golden Girls) almost steals the show as Andrew's 90 year old ""Gammy"". The beautiful Alaskan setting doesn't hurt things either. Overall this is not a unique movie or even a unique role for Bullock but it is a very funny (and fun) way to spend an afternoon.",2009
4,A vanilla THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA meets an idiotic GREEN CARD.,2009
8,"We went into this movie more or less out of despair; the cinema offerings seemed uniformly lousy and we simply wanted to see a movie that looked like fun. This one looked stupid: I'd seen Betty White promoting the movie on Jimmy Fallon's show and the scene shown was idiotic, though it did have a couple of amusing lines. Well, we were all pleasantly surprised. The outcome of the plot might be predictable, but the road getting there is surprisingly sharp and entertaining. There are quite a few witty lines and exchanges, and the delivery and timing of the two stars and, of course, of Betty White are just about perfect. Both of the lead characters have surprises in their backgrounds to reveal, and the settings are beautiful. There are one or two scenes that are clunkers, but even the dopey episode with White's Grandma Annie doing a ritualistic dance in the woods ends up having some relevance to a later plot event. The movie is well thought-out and well executed, and the actors create characters who engage us, even if we don't know anyone quite like them in our own lives.",2009
5,"The moment when pushy boss Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock) suddenly forces her unsuspecting, docile, but ever-so-hunky young assistant Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds) to tell her superiors they're to be married so she won't be deported back to her native Canada, there's a certain awkward amusement. But it's more in the way Ryan Reynolds plays it than the situation, as written -- our unease, and the actor's. If there is such a thing as ""reality,"" this ain't it. What's a Ken-doll type like Ryan Reynolds doing in a job like this? The answer is, waiting for this moment. Otherwise, if you had the sort of guy who might really be doing this sort of job, you wouldn't have a romantic comedy, and that's what the makers of the elaborately lame The Proposal are reaching for.",2009
8,"My jaw is still aching, almost an hour and a half after the credits rolled. I don't recall when I last laughed this consistently and heartfelt at a new production. Yes, this is pretty formulaic stuff... if you've seen one mismatched couple romantic comedy, you've seen them all. This never claimed to be anything other than that. It definitely delivers what one expects from the genre, without any of it being phoned in or taken any less seriously. Not every film needs to revolutionize the craft, and shape cinema for decades to come. If everything was excellent, it would become the norm, and it would cease to be special. And I find it incredible and immensely positive that a movie with this kind of humor(observational, and largely derived from typical situations that happen to everyone) can still be made, and be nicely received. Humiliation and pain are not actually funny. They get a schadenfreude reaction, ""thank goodness that didn't happen to me"", and thus we move further apart, isolate ourselves all the more. This does the opposite, letting us get closer to each other, share the little things that we've forgotten are silly or ""off"" in our everyday lives. It does go a tad too far on occasion, to get the audience going, but those instances are few in number. The acting is great all-round, and the two leads have chemistry, and play off each other well. There are countless memorable sequences, jokes and gags in this. This contains ""moments"" between Bullock and Reynolds, as well, and they genuinely work. You feel for them. The characters are just about invariably well-written, interesting and credible. In general, the script is well-done. The music is pleasant and well-chosen. This ought to entertain nearly everyone, of any age. There is a little strong and/or risqué language, and a couple of usually mild sexual references, and this tends to be inoffensive. I recommend this to all who think they may enjoy it. Chances are that you're right. 8/10",2009
8,"Okay, I had been really excited to see The Proposal ever since it came out. I was hyping it up a lot when I knew it wasn't going to be a masterpiece, but I just love Sandra Bullock and Betty White and couldn't wait to get my hands on this film! When I did, it definitely lived up to my expectations.",2009
7,"Most charming Sandra Bullock movie since While You Were Sleeping, though quite a bit more predictable. (Anyone who knows the general premise can guess how the movie is going to play out.) But it was funny and sweet, and if you need to choose something to take your wife/girlfriend to, choose this one.",2009
9,"Producer/star Sandra Bullock turns out what looks like another box office smash. Typical of most ""chick-flicks,"" the trailer tells you just about everything you're going to see. Unexpectedly, though, the surprises come from behind the scenes. The film looks gorgeous (and not just the two lead actors): the prettiness of the interior sets is matched by the choice of locations. While much of the film is set amidst the beauty of a seaside town in Alaska, even New York City is made to look like something out of a story book. It hasn't looked this good since the era of Doris Day. Typical of such a film, the costumes, even on the extras in the background, are so well-coordinated with the locations that the whole thing feels like a ""realist fantasy."" ",2009
4,"This is yet another predictable romantic comedy. The only difference is that Ryan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock make it tolerable, and even a little entertaining. Ryan Reynolds stars as Andrew Paxton, a servant to Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock). They hate each other. But when Margaret figures out she's being deported since she's not an American citizen she turns to Andrew. They say they are getting married. Andrew's Grandma Annie (Betty White, the best part of the film) is turning 90, so they go to Alaska, where Annie and Andrew's parents live. We then enter the cliché parents. Grace (Mary Steenburgen), his wacky mother, and Joe (Craig T. Nelson), his uptight dad. This is not very entertaining. The laughs mostly come from Ryan Reynolds' calm personality. He just has a way of making me entertained. There's also Oscar Nunez, who plays Oscar on TV's The Office, playing Ramone. He will remind you of an aspect of Local Hero. This is not a good movie, but it might just be worth renting just for the mild entertainment. On second thought, you can just skip it.",2009
1,"My best friend, God, I love her, we've been friends for 10 years, she's been there for me through everything as I've been there for her, I would crawl through broken glass to get her a birthday gift wait, that doesn't sound so healthy. But I do love the girl, however, what the heck did I do to her to be punished this badly when she begged me to see The Proposal? See, I don't get it, we have a ""romantic comedy"" script, no one changes anything, just the actors, every cliché in the book and somehow people fall for it. There is a needle in a haystack when it comes to a romantic comedy being actually funny or entertaining, but with the positive reviews that the IMDb users had been writing, I was actually thinking maybe this might be a good movie YOU IMDb USERS, how dare you?! Shame on you that you fell for it once again, I'm going to point out how my puppy could have written this script after I tell you the story, even though I'm sure you can figure it out for yourself.",2009
6,"The Proposal is a hard film not to enjoy but it's an even harder film to admire. Aside from the two exceptional lead performances from Ryan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock and the humour they create, the story is dowsed in clichés and left to drown. I need a film to at least be thoroughly realistic if not authentic, and the tired screenplay often delves into slapstick and camp when it should have let the leads carry the film.",2009
6,"Even though it so clearly apes the set-up of David Frankel's ""The Devil Wears Prada"", I think the first 25 minutes of this 2009 romantic comedy has genuine snap enhanced by the sharp comedy interplay between stars Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. Once the story leaves the Manhattan publishing house for the pastoral wilderness of Alaska, the story reverts into a formulaic sitcom bearing more than a passing resemblance to Bullock's break-out vehicle, 1995's ""While You Were Sleeping"", including an escalation of comic deceptions and a heart-tugging wedding confessional. Give credit to the fortyish actress/producer for not giving in too much to standard ingénue behavior this time. In fact, she plays the alpha dog with Reynolds relegated to the traditional leading lady role. The result produces enough contrived shenanigans to please Bullock's die-hard fans thanks to by-the-numbers work by director Anne Fletcher (""27 Dresses"") and first-time screenwriter Pete Chiarelli.",2009
3,"""The Proposal"" has a stellar cast and a suicidal script. The script begins brilliantly: Margaret (Sandra Bullock) a master-of-the-universe publishing exec who also happens to be very beautiful, has a younger, very sexy assistant – Andrew (Ryan Reynolds) – whom she forces to marry her because her visa has expired and she's about to be deported. Sandra Bullock is fabulously, convincingly, hateful in her opening scenes. She makes the Meryl Streep character from ""The Devil Wears Prada"" look like a shar-pei puppy in comparison. You really want to see this character put through the wringer, that is, to grow and change in response to challenging events. Ryan Reynolds is, as ever, handsome, suave, understated, smart, and a very interesting actor. As buff as he is here, and he is very buff, (preparing for the lead in the next X-Man sequel) it's Reynolds' intelligence and acting chops that are most arresting. Reynolds is as good as the romantic comedy leads from the Golden Age; he just needs the right script to be part of a classic. The rest of the cast, with the exception of an obnoxious stripper who should have been left on the cutting room floor, is similarly brilliant: Mary Steenburgen, Craig T. Nelson, Denis O'hare and especially Betty White are all solid professionals who've been fantastic in other movies.",2009
4,"I am a fan of the Romantic Comedy genre, but I failed to connect with this movie in any way. Firstly, and I'm not the only one to point this out - Sandra Bullock is too old for Ryan Reynolds and they had absolutely zero on screen chemistry. I just didn't buy it for a minute.",2009
6,"It is exactly what I expected. There were some old jokes (her entry into the office was a poor rehash of the opening of the Devil Wears Prada), there were plot holes (Betty White plays 90 but was supposed to have been married in 1929? -- that would make her a 10 year old), there were red herrings (an old girlfriend is introduced but she has no reason to be there and is not part of the plot) There were lots of problems with this film - BUT - there were also some funny scenes not shown in the trailers (eagle and dog).",2009

I even went as far as to make an explicit promise to my guest and self that there would be zero badmouthing in between scenes. As much as I would hate watching the excruciatingly sappy, formulaic storyline unfold, I would keep my lips sealed and my opinions to a minimum.

Quickly she finds a solution, that solution is her secretary, played by Ryan Reynolds, his next job will be to marry the woman he is working for.

This show has guest judges apart from the standard judges which are Rupaul, Michelle Visage, and Santino Rice. The guest judges have included actors,singers and TV personalities. The challenges are design to test the queens and to allow them to show America why it is they should win. Acting, singing, rapping, comedy, dancing, impersonation, have all been bases for challenges.

It debunks a bunch of drag-queen myths (no, they don't live in drag all of the time). RuPaul, appearing in both male (dorky and adorable) and full-on drag magnificence is a perfect blend of snarky and kind; guest judge Santino Rice from Project Runway is delightfully perceptive and just bitchy enough. I fell in love with a number of amazing queens: sweet Nina Flowers, who rocks the glam/androgynous look better than Ziggy Stardust ever could; Ongina, the feisty, funny, gender-bending fashionista who reduces everyone to tears (no spoiler here); Bebe Sahara Benet, CAMEROOOOOOOOONNNN! ",2010
9,"I just watched the 1st season of Repual's Drag Race and because of the positive energy this show implements; I attend to watch more Repaul's seasons. First of all, for those who compare this show to American Next Top Model and other shows of the same genre; you are wrong in so many levels since the core, for starters, of both shows are totally different. Rupaul's show focus on testing drag's surviving skills in the preforming business. Papering self make-up & hair, sewing unique outfits, dancing & lip-syncing, are some of the jobs assigned for the contestants in Rupaul's Drag Race because these queens are exposed to them every time they want to channel their drag persona on stage and more importantly, to themselves. In terms of human quality and productivity, Rupaul's Drag Race has a lot to offer. Being drag is not easy or safe even in our time. Drag Queens and cross-dressers has had it the hardest among the gay community considering that the majority of drag queens are gay. They put literally themselves out there for the world to judge and there are some, even among gay guys, who try to segregate themselves from them and feel repulsed by them so a drag lady has to be really courageous and develops an unbeatable character to feel strong & stable against all criticism about her life. This is another value that the show is trying to bring through the course of the race. In terms of other reality TV shows, I feel that Rupaul's Drag Race is the most genuine of them all although, ironically, the concept of the show is based on men dressing as women which is should not be up-normal anymore. Rupaul is trying to deliver a positive message in his show about loving oneself which is lacking in many competition shows. I have seen a dance competition show where the majority of the contestants below 20 and the judges are emitting real sociopath behavior when it comes to evaluating the young contestants outcome, all for the sake of the shock value to improve the network ratings. Others might find problem with the tune of the show and how it represent drag in stereotypical image which is incorrect. Drag queens are flamboyant by nature and these individuals have to channel their femininity while they are in the dress and make-up so the only question is if the viewer is comfortable about which 45 min of drag and what does it represent or if the viewer really know the difference between drag queens, transvestites, transsexuals, gays, etc. As the first show of its kind, I find that the creators and the producers of the show have done a great job and if there is a little bit of shallowness, it should be with tolerable amount especially comparing to other reality shows and computation shows which are now quantity with no quality.",2013
7,"Being a TV reality show freak as I am and a lover of everything that's original, outstanding and colorful, I got interested in this title as soon as I heard about it. It's basically America's Next Top Model: Drag Edition with some borrowed elements from Project Runway. And it's fun to watch: the 9 contestants are flamboyant and have a great sense of humor (one of them has a nickname ""Pork chop""), the style is very similar to the shows mentioned so you don't feel like you're watching a completely redesigned program. The things that are said are sometimes outrageous (""if I was a girl, I'd be a stripper or slept with lots of guys and be pregnant with lots of kids""), always a little bit shocking, and the stakes are high. There will be a lot of flirting and intimate relations ion the show I bet, but it won't be called gay sex, it will be called lesbian sex; add some famous faces to the mix and voila!

Tyra Banks wannabe RuPaul hams it up putting on the ""You are not America's next top model"" bit- except he really believes he is being himself. As mentioned, this show is lame and the way the contestants act like stereotypical ""drama queen drag queens"" shows they are just putting it on for the camera and lowering the bar for real people who are transgender and lowering the public's opinion of them (society learns from the media about people they don't know about). Plus the way the ""straight"" male and genetically female straight judges talk in sexual ways about men dressed as women makes a viewer want to throw something at their TV. Not much is real at all about the show. Find something real to watch.",2013

8,"I vaunt myself of being an independent thinker and yet I was taken by the atrocious reviews ""The Lovely Bones"" got. Rogert Ebert called it ""deplorable"" I didn't go to see it when it first came out. Shame on me! The risks Peter Jackson took, a thoroughly established filmmaker, should be applauded. True, it's not going to be everybody's cup of tea but then, what is? I was taken by surprise, a film of unbearable emotional suspense breaking every imaginable rule. We're far too used to have stories in which everything is neatly tied up by the end, so we can go back home with a fictitious peace of mind. In ""The Lovely Bones"" we know who the monster is from the time the monstrosity is committed but we're only spectators unable to do anything about it and that frustration may have turn part of the audience and most of the critics away. True the CGI of the ""in between"" is, sometimes, too much but the film as a whole is a real experience. Saorise Ronan is marvelous, so are Rachel Weitz and Mark Whalberg. Stanley Tucci was deservedly nominated for an Oscar and Susan Sarandon, another risk taker, plays the emotional constipated grandmother with great courage. Look at the exhaustion on her face as she takes care of the family, drained without betraying the arid nature of the character. As the film ended I stayed in silence for the longest time, embedded in the sadness, clinging to the hope and mystified by the massacre the critics perpetrated in this original and highly recommendable film",2010
8,"In navigating the torrent of negativity to which this movie has been subjected, one thing to keep in mind is that it's an adaptation of a very widely read and popular book.",2010
8,"I just saw The Lovely Bones today & having let it set in I thought it was a tremendous film!!! OK, I'll admit that Peter Jackson tried a little too much to overpower the film with CGI but that does not take anything away from the heart & emotion this film can generate. ",2010
10,"I'd like to preface my review with a comment about the negativity circulating around here about this movie. I don't think it's any coincidence that some of these self-appointed ""film-making experts"" who have nothing remotely positive to say about Jackson's effort cannot formulate complete sentences. It's not surprising at all that someone obsessed with the wetness of a prop in one scene and its dryness in the next lacks the faculty and capacity to appreciate the many merits of this film. It's ridiculous to knit-pick on 'unrealistic' depictions of this aspect of day to day life or that aspect. If you want a realistic depiction of day to day life, observe the world around you, not a movie screen.",2010
10,"A very unconventional movie that crosses many genres (murder/suspense/thriller/drama/fantasy), defies normal expectations and is an intense emotional experience. Right from the outset you are informed of when the lead character will be murdered and who her killer is but you are still kept on the edge of your seat and surprised by later revelations. The story dovetails between reality (before and after the murder) and a surreal afterlife realm in between Heaven and Earth. Despite the tragic, heart-wrenching and dark subject matter, the film is uplifting, captivating and hauntingly beautiful throughout. As the credits rolled, I ran through a gamut of emotion and found aspects of the film resonated with me long after. ",2011
9,"Based on the thorough thrashing this movie has received from other reviewers, I came with few expectations. Movies based on novels are, after all, often difficult to put together in a way that is satisfying to readers yet visually engaging. On this note I must disagree with the negative reviews and nay-sayers: Jackson has succeeded in both stunning me visually (hard to do, as I'm an artist and therefore picky) and thoroughly tugging my heartstrings. I found myself in tears during easily one third of the movie. Although I am an emotional person, I strongly disagree that The Lovely Bones bears much resemblance to a made-for-TV melodrama.",2010
3,"I'm not sure how so much could go wrong on this film. It seemed like a pretty sure thing: a book that has been very widely acclaimed and read as a work of sad life-and-death meditation from a 14 year old girl looking down or somehow from the ""in-between"", a kind of purgatory, after being raped and murdered, on her family and killer. It seems like the stuff that could make for some harrowing dramatic material... or, possibly, a sappy story. It turns out Jackson takes the latter route, but there's more than that wrong here. It's a giant miscalculation that has a few moments of real impact and where the performances match up with the material.",2010
3,"This movie was a piece of sappy garbage. The nauteously overdone CGI heaven sequences bring the movie to a halt every time we are there. Jackson destroyed the few characters (and actors performances for that matter) who had potential to be interesting: Susan Sarandon, Mark Wahlberg, Rachel Weiz. The movie is a cut and paste job of the book that tries to do too much with too many characters. Jackson switches point of view just enough to never allow us to connect to anyone in the film.",2009
2,"Peter Jackson's unhealthy obsession with CGI truly drives his film off a cliff in his poor adaptation of the novel ""The Lovely Bones"" Jackson forgoes the book's intelligence and intricate story and puts in an unhealthy obsession for the sensational that drives a wedged between his actors, who really are working with nothing and the viewer, who is left with a empty feeling after the film is over. The characters are nothing but objects for Jackson to manipulate in order to put in more CGI shots and their story is forfeited for a child like look into death, but with out the reality and complexity of the grieving process.",2010
1,"Director Peter Jackson's incoherent and ultimately pointless adaptation of the bestseller is just an intolerable mess from start to finish. Jackson manages to take a wonderful story about tragedy and grief and turn it to a carnival of incompetence and stupidity. Gone is the strong characterization that define each of the characters in the book and in its place is a sad spectacle of incompetence, with heavy handed CGI and bad scriptwriting that makes this film a real eye sore to sit through.",2009
1,An attractive cast quickly deteriorates in this heavily visual film that forgot its story.,2010
5,This was a highly anticipated film on its release . Based upon the cult novel by Alice Sebold and directed by Peter Jackson it opened to very Luke warm reviews by the critics . Normally I don't care what critics say but since I was very short of money I decided to save myself the price of a cinema ticket and catch it for free. In the mean time a lot of time had passed before I caught it tonight and I don't know if the criticisms of the film adaptation of THE LOVELY BONES had prejudiced my own opinion but this is a highly offensive film and we all know why don't we ? ,2012
1,"Oh my! This was a horrible movie. It has been a while since I have seen one this bad. The acting was fine, everyone did a good job on that end, but the cut scenes to the acid trip land of Susie Salmon's ""Heaven"" were a waste of time. She never did anything there that impacted the story line. At least in ""What Dreams May Come"" there was a point to it. So here are some highlights of lack of logic and frustration for me:- Watching Mark Wahlberg, who they couldn't hide his frame under the 70's shirts, get beat up by a wimpy high schooler was completely bogus! - The ending with the icicle causing the killer to trip and fall off a cliff was horrible, watching Mark beat the crap out of him and throw him off a cliff would have been much better. - The LSD trip scenes of heaven were just plain boring. If Susie could have actually done anything to help her family that would have been good. - Mark's character welcoming his wife back after however long she had wimped out on her family was pretty bogus. - Mark's daughter holding the book of the killer to see his mom and dad have some fairy tale greeting and not saying, ""Look, I found her killer, and he almost got me and may try again...Oh hi mom!"" was completely stupid. - Many more...",2010
3,I am an ardent admirer of Peter Jackson's 'Heavenly Creatures' and rate it #1 in my top 5 drama films of all time thus far. I was looking forward to seeing this film adaptation of Alice Sebold's novel—which I have not read—as it sounded like he was going back to his 'Heavenly Creature' roots with the story that was presented. I had read some disappointing reviews before seeing 'The Lovely Bones' so did not go in with much expectation but kind of hoping that the detractors may be wrong: unfortunately they were right.,2010
4,"Pretty to look at, beautiful at times even, but with all his distractions Jackson has somehow managed to take brutal and disturbing subject matter and leave me feeling nothing apart from vague amusement and disbelief that he actually went there.",2009
1,I had heard such wonderful things about the book and decided to read it...I could not put it down. The power of this story and the feeling of what lies in the hereafter and how people cope with death and the grieving process and what lies beyond was overwhelmingly powerful. I was extremely excited to watch the movie...what a disappointment. Truly the worst adaptation of a book that I have seen since they killed Flowers In The Attic. The best parts of the book are manipulated and regenerated so much that you do not even get the true meaning of what truly made this story memorable. Especially the key role that certain characters played that they did not even give the light of day!! What happened to the most important part that Ruth played??? The characters do not even get a chance to grow up for goodness sake!!! The whole point of the story is how the dead and the undead cope after wards! There are not enough bad things I can say about this movie.,2010
3,"Surely not for teenagers and younger, since the whole killer scenes are quite disturbing. ",2012
1,"Peter Jackson did a HORRIBLE job with this movie. Just like all other book-to-movie adaptations, it was a TRAIN WRECK. There are several missing and/or out-of-order events that were crucial to the story, as well as some discrepancies from the book.",2010
3,"There is no way we can challenge Peter Jackson's creative and directorial abilities, however it is evident that even the greats can face an 'off-day'. The legendary touch that we saw in The Lord of the Rings series was sadly not present, as this in-depth tale was mishandled, juggled and dropped in a very unflattering manner - not what we expect from Mr Jackson and his team. The Lovely Bones is potentially a life changing story, but it is squeezed out poorly.",2010
2,"Peter Jackson's The Lovely Bones is a colossally misguided failure. Based on the well-received 2002 novel by Alice Sebold, Jackson -- along with his Lord of the Rings cohorts, Philippa Boyens and Fran Walsh -- has penned a meandering screenplay, made merely all the worse by uniformly awful performances, poor editing, and generally bad film-making.",2010
1,"This movie was horrible! There are so many things to say about it I almost don't know where to begin. First off let me just say that it was a very good book. I do like Peter Jackson and I thought the talent in the movie had the skills to be good. The problem, though is that Peter Jackson apparently not only lost a bunch of weight, but some of his brain must have leaked out too. He did a very, very poor job on this one. It was a story about young girls being raped and murdered yet he wanted us to feel happy about it? The only good scene was went the sister was snooping around the house and then the brief chase, but even then he screwed up! Here's this teenage girl running from a man who she knows for a fact now killed her sister and she just broke into his house and now when she gets home completely out of breath, she sees her mom and just says, ""Nah I will just forget about this dude who might still be after me and I will stay quiet."" It seems like forever b4 she eventually gives the book over to Susan Surandon and then the scene ends without us seeing her reaction. It was real bad. Speaking of Susan, I love her, but she was like a damn character out of some comedy with Seth Rogan or something. It was totally misplaced. Also the trailer for this film made it seem like the girl would help catch her killer and that is just not how things were. Then to top it off the bad guy dies in what is one of the absolute lamest deaths I have ever seen. Not good. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!",2010
4,"I'll start by saying I've read the book twice (just because I'm a PJ fan so wanted to know what he would be working on) and loved it. No, it's not brilliantly written and does veer off in places but I found it genuinely moving. So went to the film (London) with high hopes, loving both source material and director. Major disappointment.",2009
1,"Just as the 3 ""Star Wars"" prequels ruined the Star Wars franchise (though I never liked it to begin with), this new ""Star Trek"" prequel is a damaging blow to the Star Trek movie franchise, and this prequel crap needs to stop now. The pathetic writers of this new Hollywood generation can't come up with any new, creative ideas, so they just keep going back in time (as they did with ""Batman Begins"") with established franchises, as if we need to see over and over again how the characters we love so much got their start. And the BIG problem with this new ""Star Trek"" movie is that they TOTALLY foul up the history of these characters and then insult our intelligence by having Spock (Prime - the older Spock) say that his actions altered the course of history (which, we learn, is why Kirk's father dies on the day of his birth this time around). What a lame, poor excuse for why the history of Mr. Spock, Captain Pike, Captain Kirk, Dr. McCoy and even Chekov is so radically different from what it is in the Original Series and its Original movies. What is different? For one, in TOS, Kirk first served under Captain Robert April on a different starship, and had years of experience as a first officer before becoming captain. In this movie, Kirk's serves with Captain Pike of the Enterprise first, right alongside Spock, and on his FIRST day of service he becomes first officer and then on the very same day is suddenly promoted to Captain! Quite a leap up the ladder! In TOS, Spock is supposed to have served under Captain Pike 13 years before he and Kirk meet. Also, Dr. McCoy suddenly becomes Chief Medical Officer on the very same day that Kirk suddenly becomes Captain. Wow, what a coincidence! This movie so ridiculously rushes the whole thing, but it's OK because Spock altered everything, right? In this movie, Chekov is on the bridge as navigator even BEFORE Kirk ever steps foot on the Enterprise. That means he has MORE experience than Kirk! So in TOS how did Kirk become Captain while Chekov was a lowly ensign? Oh yeah, Spock altered history. And Chekov is said to be 17 in this movie. When did he start at Starfleet Academy--when he was 13?! Finally, this movie has no intelligent (or even intelligible) story. It has a ludicrous story of the Romulans (who look like a biker gang in this movie) creating Black Holes out of planets. And this movie is all action and loudness with dizzying camera shaking, which totally goes against TOS's cleverness of playing on ideas rather than action. Abrams has no business in the ""Star Trek"" franchise, and I hope he never makes another ""Star Trek"" movie. But I guess as long as they make plenty of $$$$, it doesn't matter. That's more important than being faithful to the characters and history of the show, right?",2009
1,"Firstly: Not only is the writing vapid, you have no empathy towards the two dimensional characters and so the entire movie is missing pathos. The plot is itself thin, it seems that a few explosions and special effects are the limits of depth to this director. I wasted 80 bucks buying tickets to this piffle. And the lapses in logic, (one of many examples: why would any military grant a cadet Captaincy of the Federations most valuable warship?)",2009

Not the kind of fan that knows everything that happened to everybody in every episode on every stardate type of fan, but a fan nonetheless. The last few movies were dull and I never even bothered to watch The Enterprise TV series. When I heard a new movie was in the works I was very happy. Once I heard JJ Abrams was directing my heart sank (still can't forgive him for what he turned Lost into).",2009
1,Every Star Trek fan knows the ST movies aren't that good. This is because they try to be different from the series in appealing to the mainstream. But Star Trek is rock solid and it can handle some of the absolutely silly scripts we have seen in some past movies.,2009

Characters such as Kirk, Spock, Picard, Data, Janeway, Seven of Nine; ideas like the prime directive; phrases like ""Live long and Prosper"", ""Good God Jim, I'm a doctor not a."". I wouldn't consider myself a ""Trekkie"", but I do have a deep affection for this series and world.",2009
4,"The initial idea was great. Fans expected some good story telling about time before The Original Series. But we got childish mambo-jumbo with lot of explosions and incoherent plot. We learned that planet Vulcan was destroyed, but how did it manage to exist in The Original Series and movie sequels? Why did screenplay ignore the knowledge of fans in such arrogant way? Acting looks like gang of high school boys and girls having fun of private party. OK, I can understand if in the mind of production the target consumers supposed to be children, but why all the fans from 1960s were ignored? Pity for such a great franchise. Unbelievably bellow Star Trek films which had great screenplays.",2009
1,I'll admit I am not a trekkie. I saw the movie because the trailer looked interesting. I want my 10 bucks back.,2009
1,"Honestly, this is the worst franchise exploitation train wreck since the dreadful Alien vs. Predator: Requiem disaster. I really wish the producers of this film would have just called this crud ""Space Wars"" so as not to tarnish the good name of Star Trek. This movie reminded me of Saturday morning cartoons where anything goes for no apparent reason but to insert a laugh or a stupid stunt. There is no logical, comprehensible storyline or continuity here. Kirk behaves like an obnoxious self-centered jerk who doesn't deserve to be in charge of anything let alone the Federation's flagship. Spock always looks like he's not in control of his emotions & apparently he thinks it's logical to be making out with his communications officer whenever possible. The black hole science is absurd. Thanks to instant black holes ( just add red matter ) one can either travel in time or crush an enemy ship or destroy a planet in a singularity. You're going to have to regress your brain, BIG TIME, in order to stomach this film's physics. If you are able to dumb down your brain to the point that, say, you not only believe that the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are cool but you believe they actually exist, then you can enjoy this inane story. Otherwise keep your popcorn bag close by in case you feel the urge to vomit. I never thought the Star Trek movies were anything more than average popcorn fare, save for maybe The Wrath of Kahn, which probably best captures the essence of Gene Roddenberry's vision. This movie is a just a vile pile of Hollywood crap. You won't suck me in again all you fake reviewers on Rotten Tomatoes!",2009
2,"I had arrived at this movie with high hopes after having heard a favorable review by a friend. It turns out that my friend was giving a favorable review of his date, I am quite sure that he paid no attention to the movie, because anyone watching this filth that owns half a brain could not possibly enjoy it.",2009

The whole storyline from beginning to end was impossible to believe possible.",2009
1,"After the recently terrible James Bond film, and the equally terrible ending to the Bourne trilogy, it appears that the ""wobbly camera"" disease has spread to another franchise with similar results. There appears to be a direct correlation between the rate of camera wobble and the ""pace"" of the action scene being shot. We all know that this camera wobble is artificial and often done during editing and special effect overlay, but the outcome is the same and it is unwatchable. It appears to me to be a ""technique"" used today in many films to prevent the audience clearly seeing the shot, the special effects and the action occurring. Possibly because the audience would see mismatches between the special effects, the action being overlaid and the poor quality stunt work. I gave this film a rating of one out of ten principally because the wobbly camera technique is something we now see in many films, particularly films with large amounts of special effects and it is cheating the audience out of the opportunity to see if the shot actually flows and to observe how the special effects are melded to the shot and the action. Do we really want to come away from every film thinking we have been in a small boat in a rough swell? I certainly don't and I now add JJ Abrams to the list of Marc Forster who created the worst Bond film of all time with ""jiggle camera"" and Paul Greengrass who destroyed the Bourne Trilogy with ""shaky camera"". Hang your head in shame, this trio had the opportunity to make great films, each carrying their franchise forward and each in turn has been unable to achieve an outcome without the use of ""shaky camera"", which is an automatic turnoff for the audience.",2009

First of all, before ANYTHING else, no matter WHAT you think, there was no reason to completely destroy the Star Trek universe by blowing up Vulcan. It was Abrams taking a dump on the ENTIRE history of Trek. As a story point is was stupid, too. And WAY too easy. This fact alone ensures that I will never watch another Abrams product - no matter what it is (let alone his next Trek movie).",2009
8,"Most great comedies are based on fundamental truths -- we find a deal of humour in the illumination of our own human tragedy.

The story looked like a bunch of toilet jokes and elementary grade humor slapped together resulting in a forgettable comedy that definitely doesn't live up to the hype. One of the worst moment in that movie was in the casino scene where they won over $800000 with the help of a black jack book, I mean it looked like the script writer couldn't find a better way to get the characters out of that problem and he just went for the easy way with an all time classic (and cliché) video editing scene just like the karate kid movies (you know the whole ""be a champion in 2 minutes"" thing). The acting in some scenes looked like it came straight from a forgotten b-grade , straight to VHS movie. I know that a lot of people found that movie hilarious but I didn't find anything fresh in that movie, it was the first time that at the end I pulled out my cellphone and started watching my sms out of boredom.",2009

Now, I found SuperBad, 40 yr old virgin, Something About Mary, Animal House all hilarious movies....not opposed to 'gross' humor is my point. But this movie was completely humorless, had no soul, each character more deplorable than the last. What makes movies funny is often the tension between the well-intentioned 'good' character and the rogues who beset them, (think Ben Stiller's character vs Matt Dillon's in SAM). Nothing like that here, really the character who might have brought comic tension into the story was the one roasting on the roof, off-camera for 95% of the time...dull, dull, dull.",2010

I watched it on my own so I'm confused about what parts others found funny. I guess what this movie lacks for me is wittiness, it's more of scenic humor possibly. I don't know how else to explain it because quite honestly I'm confused and just wish I hadn't watched it.

Even Mike Tyson generated a few laughs for everyone.

Some of the attempts at comedy are so, so old. OK, here are a couple little spoilers. In one scene one of the guys is face down on the ground about to get up & another one of guys opens up the car door and opens it bumping the guy laying down on the ground in the head- so, so stupid! This scene was funny in cartoons when I was under 10! Another spoiler coming- in a different scene one of the guys finds a used condom in there car and they start grossing out and tossing it around- so stupid and not funny anymore since I was 17.

Meanwhile the nerdy guy is more scared of his fiancé than the tiger! The hotel finds a bed thrown on a statue but assume it was thrown out of a window, even though they don't have windows?????? What the hell! The tiger is drugged and put into their car to take it back to Mikes place? Have you lifted a tiger lately?? I know they are trying to be funny, but they lost me from the beginning. By the time the photo's are shown at the end I was already over it. Not only that there are absolutely no consequences in the end for any of them. BOOOOOOORRRRIIIINNGGG! ""Yeah, lets high five each other"" Amazing that Hollywood can produce this crap and promote it so hard, and still make huge dollars. In conclusion, rent Very bad things, now that's a Vegas movie. And if you don't get what's going on in that movie, like one person who called it an evil movie about a homicide........IT'S A BLACK COMEDY!!!",2009
3,"I don't find the ""dumb guy"" shtick funny anymore. If I want to see guys portrayed like complete buffoons all I have to do is watch television commercials and sitcoms all day. It's getting old and played out, especially because the Apatow clan and similar movies have covered this ground over and over the past few years. This movie just threw a bunch of random crap at the screen to see if it would stick and people would laugh. I guess they did, look at the high IMDb rating. I know that happens with new movies and the rating will go down over time, but come on.",2009
2,"When movies get billed as the comedy of the year, the blockbuster everybody is talking about. Well, I tend to walk to the other way and I wish had sticked to that plan before deciding to watch this complete crap.",2009
1,"In my opinion is overrated. I voted 1 (one) for this movie hoping to lower a bit the 8.something rating. I didn't pay to see it, it was almost free on the internet. Maybe it's not as bad as many of the new movies from Hollywood but no way this is a top 250 movies all the time. I was expecting, in many situations, that the story will get more complicated but instead it was another dot on the linear path of the story. Last 20 minutes were completely out of fun or suspense. So, overall not a good story no such act or quote to remember. Many will say: 'It's just a comedy don't look too hard, it's a movie for watching at home during week-end, not demanding to understand, just fun and relaxing' I will reply to them: ' I hate that kind of movies!'",2009
10,"I reckon it will be noted as the funniest film this year as I think it would be hard to top. It is certainly the best comedy I've seen for a couple of years. The cast were excellent with a truly great dynamic of main characters played by very talented comedic actors. The performance that sticks out is Zach Galifianakis' character 'Alan'. Zach has brought a fresh character to the screen and with the quality of this films script the combination of the two are what brings this to the point of a comedy masterpiece. As a film fan who is partial to only rating thrillers and dramas with a sense of respect, this film reminds me of how comedy can be the masterclass of cinema and the reason why we enjoy it so much. My Dad is not a fan of comedy as such and normally sees going to watch films of this type as a chore but to see him laugh as much as my brother and myself at 65 years of age shows how its humor can break not just an age gap but more importantly a persons taste in film. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this movie and do not wish to say anything about the story. The best thing to do is to go and see this film for yourself and you'll realize what i'm talking about.",2009

9,"From the moment that I saw the trailer for The Hangover I knew I had to see this movie, I don't think I had laughed so hard watching a trailer in my life. But one thing I was kind of concerned about was how most movies just show the funny parts in the trailer and this would just be another ""Old School"" type of movie that would have no originality. I saw The Hangover this afternoon and I just can't believe how funny this movie was. The great thing about it as absurd as the story is, seriously, it's kind of realistic in some matter. I mean, who hasn't had a morning where they woke up from a night of drinking and just cannot remember one thing about the night before? This is a comedy mystery story that just gets funnier with each scene that is played due to the strong cast, great chemistry and a hilarious story.",2009
10,Absolutely loved this movie. The theatre was all laughs through the whole movie. Don't go expecting a cinematic masterpiece but if you are looking for out of control laughter this is your flick. The story was funny the acting was hilarious and I don't want to spoil it but the end was so funny my wife hurt her ribs (no I'm not kidding) from laughing so hard. ,2009
10,"Zach Galifianakis, Ed Helms and Bradley Cooper fall so perfectly into the circumstances of a night out without the wife/girlfriend—a bachelor party, no less—that we're all happy we're safe in the audience clucking our tongues but secretly envying every single moment (one that includes the ever watchable Heather Graham). These boys fall and fall hard, and trying to pick up the pieces of a night they strangely can't remember brought more laughs than the last time I laughed this consistently (that was ""There's Something About Mary"").",2009
7,"Yes, okay, it's very funny at times down right hilarious. What sets this comedy apart from others of its ilk, is a well structured script and a pace that doesn't allow any form of thinking. The chemistry between the four leads is also a plus. There is a surprising, maybe unconscious, touch of innocence in the midst of this night of debauchery that makes it palatable even charming. Bradley Cooper is coming into his own and I'm absolutely certain that he was born to play Emperor Caligula in a future Ridley Scott flick. The women, as in most films about a bunch of heterosexuals doing childish things, are treated appallingly. They are the enemy that they have to protect themselves from or just escape, run, run as fast and as far as you can. Try to find the hooker with a heart of gold, and if she looks like Heathter Graham, that much better and forget about settling down. ""The Hangover"" has already become the surprise hit of the summer 2009. I say, well done, it could have been worse",2009

8,"I've been reading lot of horrible comments that are based solely on the issues surrounding the movie rather than the movie itself. I wasn't excited to see this movie, I'm not interested in sports at all. The movie kept my attention though and well. It moved along quickly and pulled me into the story and left me feeling inspired. I wasn't excited to see a blonde sandy bullock in a sports movie, I think that's what might have turned me off the most, but she did really good job! It's rare to see a movie where there's a really strong lead female character. Whether you like Leigh Anne Touhy or not in the end, she is certainly entertaining and Sandra Bullock does a great job of bringing her onto the screen. The youngest son did an amazing job! So much talent in him. The character of Mike I think could have used a few more lines, even if he's supposed to be shy and reserved. All the actors really did a great job though for the most part. No it's not an epic Oscar winning film, although I wouldn't be surprised if Bullock got nominated for something for her acting. It is NOT loaded with propaganda as the other reviews might suggest. It's a light entertaining pick me up film that would be an excellent choice to bring the family to, most likely the reason why they released it over the Holidays.",2009
10,"I don't usually feel the need to leave comments, but this movie was just to well done not to. I went in expecting more football, more hits & highlights & as a huge football fan that was one of the main draws of the movie. The football actually takes a back seat to a wonderful story that is well executed by everyone involved. I've always thought Sandra Bulluck has been over-rated, but she nails this role & deserves some recognition down the road. The movie is so fantastic that anyone and everyone can relate and feel connected to the characters. The ideal target audience for this movie is children and adults alike. This movie should be an Oscar contender but I know these types of movies rarely ever win. Definitely deserves my vote!",2009
8,"I have just returned from seeing the blind side. I was pleasantly surprised by the movie, particularly it's more poignant moments. Yes, this is a sports story, yes this is a biopic, but it is also in large part an interpersonal drama. It is rare to see a movie these days that relies on drama to carry it-not special effects, lush historically accurate wardrobe, or astounding make up- just a story that resonates with the viewer. That this story is based on contemporary facts makes it all the more resonant. Events that might have been handled superficially, predictably or exploited for dramatic purposes were instead presented in a nuanced and profound manner. Michael's biological mother was portrayed with dignity and compassion. In short, the aspects of Michael's story that make it moving and inspiring were captured with skill and integrity. As for the negative feedback regarding this movie that began when the only the trailers were available - I think the comments might be more a reflection of the world view of the authors rather than a reflection of the quality of the movie or the reality of Michael's story. Some people think the movie ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" was a story about racism in the south, or that ""The Crying Game"" was a movie about the IRA - to me those were the settings for the drama, and not the drama itself. John Lee Hancock really bit off a lot when he took on this project-but as it turned out, it was not more than he could chew. Remember when Attorney General Eric Holder commented on how we were a nation of cowards when it came to openly discussing race? With this movie, Hancock has demonstrated he is not one of those cowards. He did not ignore the racial or class differences of the characters in this movie, and he avoided using the movie to make a social statement with the movie. He allowed these character attributes to be what they were in reality, and told the human drama in an effective and sensitive manner.",2009
7,"I'm a sports snob. I strongly believe there's only a handful of truly great sports movies. It's just too difficult for filmmakers to recreate the drama that takes place on the field. So when the Creative Loafers at sportschump.net asked me to review The Blind Side, a sports movie I would never see,starring an actress I really don't like, I was skeptical. But they promised me Jujubees, so I agreed to attend the premiere.",2009
8,"In the fact-based film The Blind Side, a burly homeless black teenager Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) is taken in by the family of Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock), a spunky white Christian mother of two and assisted through school until he achieves success as a football player in high school and college, eventually being drafted in the first round by the professional Baltimore Ravens. The film, written and directed by John Lee Hancock and adapted from a book by Michael Lewis, is undemanding entertainment that lacks a great deal of subtlety but is continuously entertaining and emotionally involving and redefines the true meaning of family values.",2010

It was really one of the most amazing career rehabilitations since Travolta in ""Pulp Fiction"".",2009

I really think she might get an Oscar for it this year. The real Leigh Anne was born just so that Sandra Bullock could play her in this movie. She was dead on throughout the whole movie. If you haven't seen it you have to. I usually get really bored watching true life stories but this one kept me interested thru out the whole movie. If there was such a thing as a perfect movie, this would be it. Great plot, Amazing actors, Talented directors, etc. Go and see it. And I really think both men and women will like this one.

1,"Only a public that has been spoon-fed sugar-coated realities for many years could possibly find anything of merit in this incredibly insipid Disney tale for (white) adults. The horror, the horror, indeed (to quote a previous reviewer, who I believe was quoting a far better film).",2010
2,"I endured this movie wondering How on earth the scriptwriters were able to come up with such fakery! The fact the Sandra Bullock has been lauded for her role in the movie is no surprise given that she is basically the only character with more that a few lines in the movie, she does do a good job, but it wasn't 'outstanding'. Another reason to question the script is the lack of dialogue of the main protagonist - Michael. He is written into the movie as a chap with low IQ and almost mute - now, given that the actual young man is intelligent and a fantastic sportsman, I don't understand why he is portrayed in such a dim light - it actually comes across as racially condescending. On this note, we almost turned the movie off due to it's many cringeworthy moments such as the portrayal of racial differences (the 'oh-my god it's s bunch of black guys smoking pot' scene, stepford wives lunches- so perfectly perfect it is hideous-they even bicker perfectly, the fact that the house is portrayed as being HUGE but they only had room enough for Michael to sleep on the $10,000 sofa, (I could go on...) Though is was so cringy - it bought us much mirth after the movie in acting-out these ridiculous scenes again. Watch the movie if you like to be taken to lala land and enjoy life as fakery. Avoid like the plague if you prefer the scratched, worn, real-spirited portrayal of authenticity. (why oh why did Kathy Bates act in this two bit role?)",2010
1,"This movie could have been interesting. We could have learned all about the issues Michael Oher had to overcome in order to get to where he is today.

1,"I am absolutely shocked.....and not in a good way. Has American cinema fallen so far that we can consider this monstrosity even an ""average"" movie at best? The story was utterly predictable and failed to instill any sense of surprise in any moments. From the first twenty minutes, you could predict the course of the plot if you'd seen any kind of ""inspirational"" sports movie. The characters were no better. Tim Mcgraw faded into the wallpaper about a third of the way through the movie, and I was about ready to hurl a brick at my TV just so I could pretend I was throwing a real one at SJ. The character of Michael Oher seemed like a baby made from the genes of Forrest Gump and John Coffey, with a touch of Radio, but I'll give the actor pity points for effort. My greatest contempt, however, goes towards Sandra Bullock. I honestly think she did a better job in ""All About Steve"". She seems like an amalgamation of the ""rough on the players cuz I love 'em"" coaches you see in every other generic sports movie, only with estrogen and a TERRIBLY faked southern accent. I was shocked when they chose her for the Oscar over Gabourey Sidibe, who, unlike Bullock, seems to know one or two things about ACTING. All in all, if you're going to watch this movie, I suggest you drink heavily beforehand so you don't have to comprehend the awfulness of this ""film""",2010

7,"I must confess I was weeping 5 minutes into the movie and that's unusual for me. I had read the book and in the book nothing is that black or that white for that matter, but this is as movie and as a movie it works. I was expecting commercial interruptions every few minutes, the film felt so much like a TV movie. But that is not necessarily a bad thing. The Michael Oher story had to be told even with the poetic licenses that the film takes, shamelessly. Sandra Bullock plays herself beautifully as always and her character with all her saintly stern, southern modern American woman could not move away too far from ""Miss Congeniality"". But it works and at the end of the day, after paying the prices one pays at the box office, it's almost enough. Why they had to ruin it with an Oscar nomination? The nomination makes you look for something in her performance that clearly isn't there. If you go to a Sandra Bullock movie, the quality of the movie may vary but she is always terrific, playing that Sandra Bullock character. Good for her.",2010

8,"Before anyone sees this film, Zach Snyder should be given a pat on the back. He did what a dozen directors struggled to do for twenty years: he made a Watchmen movie. It seems unthinkable that anyone could properly put the greatest graphic novel of all time on the screen. But Snyder has done pretty much that.",2009
10,"Watchmen is the long-awaited graphic novel adaptation that has for a long time been deemed un-filmable. There have been many different points over the years where this movie was supposed to be made, which always ended up not happening. But now Watchmen is finally here in all its glory, and it's probably the best adaptation possible of this complex graphic novel. The story takes place in an alternative 1985, with Nixon beginning his third term as president, and the streets of New York are gritty, dark, and violent. Within New York lives a group of costumed heroes that used to be loved by society, but are now hated by practically everybody. One night a depressed retired hero named The Comedian is murdered by a masked person that breaks into his apartment. Another hero named Rorschach, who wears a mask with shifting ink blots, believes that someone is picking off costumed heroes to begin their own agenda of destruction. Rorschach begins investigating and hunting down the person that is responsible for The Comedian's death. Meanwhile we meet another hero who glows blue, and has almost literally become a God. His name is Dr. Manhattan, and although he has the power to save the world he won't do it because he has lost many of his human emotions. The other main costumed heroes are Night Owl and Silk Spectre, who begin to fall in love amid the chaos of their secret lives. Any other attempt to describe the complex plot of this movie would be nearly impossible.",2009
10,"Firstly, I have not read the graphic novel. This was deliberate, since I knew there was going to be a movie, and reading any book tends to ruin the movie. I'm sure there are a whole bunch of things in the graphic novel that they left out or changed, and it's hard for those who have read it to imagine how people could understand the subtleties of the story without it. But trust me, the morally complex, multi-layered characters and plot were very well delivered by the movie alone. There was nothing that seemed like it didn't make sense or wasn't quite explained. The movie was just about perfect.",2009

I am coming to the reluctant conclusion it may be one of the greatest films ever made, likely a top-10, right up there with Citizen Kane, Alien, Godfather, you know the drill. The story is dazzling, action-packed, politically aware, and brilliant. As good or better than Sin City. The actors, many of whom (sigh) I am not familiar with are brilliant. Jackie Earle Haley practically picks the film up bodily and carries it. The direction is not merely good it is perfect. Even the sound track seems to move the story along. (And I am no fan of Zack Synder outside of this film. MAN OF STEEL was a sellout to the ""action"" crowd, creating chaos out of order. Ditto Sucker Punch). But art is like that. Sometimes it surprises you. Many critics have said that Social Network is the new Citizen Kane. But they confabulate. This film could actually be.",2013
7,"Watchmen turned out to be an engrossing film, one definitely worth seeing. I have to say, I wasn't enthusiastic about watching it at first. It's based on the great graphic novel by Alan Moore. It's widely considered to be the best graphic novel ever. Films adapted form great literary works usually don't turn out well. The film also didn't have a big budget. More money was thrown at making Iron Man (2008) and The Dark Knight (2008), for example. This doesn't matter though because Watchmen surpasses all comic book films in terms of professionalism. Zack Snyder is a good action director. Just watch 300 (2007) for proof. With Watchmen he demonstrated that he is just a good director overall. He works well with actors. The acting in the film is almost universally excellent. Everyone gets to shine. Even Malin Akerman had her moments. Not one character feels like a throwaway. All this is further complimented by the good choices in costumes. No one can deny that the heroes in Watchmen look cool. The CGI is excellent too. Be it Doctor Manhattan or Nite Owl's airship, everything looks just right. Snyder staged some truly impressive dramatic scenes. The use of music is inspired. The score by Tyler Bates is obviously fitting, but the choices in songs may surprise some people. I, however, think that the songs are just right. It was good to hear Bob Dylan's ""The Times They Are a-Changing"" at the beginning and Leonard Cohen's ""First We Take Manhattan"" at the end. What made me like the film even more is its cinematography by Larry Fong. The look of each decade was captured perfectly. The 1980s are somewhat dark in the film's alternate reality though. Nuclear war seems close, and society is sick. To all this is added the sweet look that's also present in the graphic novel. There are many images in Watchmen that are memorable, even unforgettable. There are so many interesting details that I couldn't wait to watch the film more than once to pick up what I missed on first viewing. Thankfully, Snyder didn't change the politics and observations of the graphic novel for the film. Some parts are missing but the endeavour is still a thought-provoking two-and-a-half hours. Plus, it has a clear narrative. This is a comic book film for mature audiences. It stands above other comic book films because it's smart and because it tackles some of the most important issues, even mankind's existence. Watchmen was expertly made, there is a lot to like about it. I respect it and I like it more than any other superhero motion picture. It gets a high recommendation from me.",2010
9,"After months of anticipation, today I was fortunate enough to be able to attend the premiere of Watchmen over here.

8,"""No. Not even in the face of Armageddon. Never compromise.""-Rorschach While Rorschach's (Jackie Earle Haley) proclamation may be possible to uphold as a superhero, the refusal to compromise on behalf of the filmmaker in the process of literary adaptation is impossible. As film theorist André Bazin wrote, ""Faithfulness to form, literary or otherwise, is illusory: what matters is the equivalence in meaning of the forms."" In other words, Bazin is arguing that each medium has its own modes of representation, thus the struggle for formal fidelity is a lost cause and that the main objective is that the adaptation should capture the original work's essence. Bazin continues, stating, ""All it takes is for the filmmakers to have enough visual imagination to create the cinematic equivalent of the style of the original."" Zach Snyder's (""300"") attempt to adapt Alan Moore and Dave Gibbon's ""Watchmen"" (1986-1987) is compromised but that is the only possible way an adaptation can work as a film. He captures the Bazinian essence of Moore and Gibbon's work, a deconstruction of the superhero mythos, with an aesthetic that also captures much of the style of the original graphic novel (to the degree it is possible in film). Will die-hard fans be disappointed? No doubt, but quite unjustly. Even with Snyder's compromised ending, which ultimately can be interpreted as being more devastating than the climax concocted by Moore and Gibbons (although the film lacks a sequence on par with the opening pages of the comic's twelfth volume), Snyder's ambitious attempt is the best that could be done in a feature film.",2009

10,"Amazing film. Bringing a graphic novel as layered and complex as the Watchmen to the screen is no easy task and Snyder did a brilliant job. Watchmen was as unconventional, intellectual, cerebral, and unique to the cinema world as much as the graphic novel was to the comic book world. It's hard to not compare this to the novel but as a film it is brilliant. Zack Snyder truly did the story justice. Look around online at where other filmmakers before him wanted to take the film. There was even one script where they updated it to be in present day and have the threat be from terrorists. Snyder single handedly saved the Watchmen from a cinematic nightmare. He had the script reworked into the closest adaptation of any graphic novel to date. I would like to shake his hand and thank him for being one of the few filmmakers these days that actually cares about being faithful to the source material of film adaptations. Beyond being faithful, Snyder brought an amazing style and vision to the project. He brought an independent film sensibility to a big budget picture which not many people have the guts to do. I don't think enough can be said on what a great job he did. ",2009

This is the problem: you fans of the book come to the movie already caring about the characters, while movie-goers depend upon the movie alone to give them a reason to care about the characters and the world they live in. (Which brings me to another problem: no one cares about saving the seamy rightwing version of the infinitely corrupt world of the 1980s. If that negative fascist fantasy dies in an explosion, good riddance. Isn't that the fulfilment of the rightist fantasy?) The movie fails mostly on this count, though there are other weaknesses. (I'm talking to you, slo-mo spacecraft sex scene.) I found myself caring only about Rohrschach (well-acted by Haley). The big blue guy did not seem to have any real dilemmas and absolutely no emotional depth, the diabolical plan of the hero-villain was obscure until it was revealed and too late to care, and nothing lost seemed worth shedding a tear for. As for the rest of the world and the characters, I just could not wait for the impending nuclear holocaust because then I would be able to go home. And I'm actually a very peaceable person who in real life doesn't wish instant vaporization on anyone. Several people left early, which I have never seen in a movie theater before. (I guess I've never been to a movie that spent this many hours being bad.) In sum, worth the money only if you love all things Watchmen and, perhaps, if you really liked Forest Gump and Moonraker. (Having said this, I could have watched a whole movie about the giant blue guy winning the Vietnam War. That scene was pretty cool.)",2009
1,I haven't read the book/comic.,2009
1,"Why? why? why? if this movie was so difficult to make than why did Snyder decide to take it on. Unlike many of the people in the united states, i have unfortunately never read watchmen, or even heard about it. I checked the rating out on IMDb and decided to see it. while i sat through these painful 2 hours and 40 minutes, i really didn't want to know anything about them or even hear about them again! how this movie ended up with a rating so high beats me!!! i'm sorry to all those people who say the negative comments are coming from people who haven't read the graphic novel, but a movie is a movie, it should stand alone, i'm supposed to understand mostly everything even without having read the book, otherwise the makers of the movie should have made the book a prerequisite to the film!!! there were just too many plots happening all at once, very very very long introduction, that i lost interest in all the characters long before intermission, and gave up on seeing anything that would impress me.",2009
1,"I've never read the graphic novel, nor have I ever heard of the movie prior to the copyright controversy. When the controversy broke, I asked myself ""wth is Watchmen?"". Then the hype followed shortly after the official release date. ",2009
2,"At first it was hard to believe this film was two hours and forty minutes long. It felt more like an eternity. The whole first two hours were nothing more that flashback after flashback. By the time the film reached it's so called ""climax"" you really don't care about the characters any longer. For crying out loud, half the actors looked bored just making it. Too many subplots (most of which come out of nowhere, and go no further). The only people I could suggest watching this movie would be the fans of the original graphic novel. Maybe those people will actually have a clue what was going on. As for the directing I'm not going to comment. I don't know what the film was even supposed to be about, so I'm not sure if Zack Snyder succeeded in ""pulling off"" the original context. As it is he didn't do it for those of us that never read the material. In summary, the characters are two dimensional, the plot is dizzily boring and confusing at the same time, and by the time you get to the end you don't even care if nuclear war happens or not (I was rooting for merely to destroy the miserable excuse for Nixon).",2009
1,"My initial thought after leaving the movie theatre for WATCHMEN was that I had just paid ten dollars to see a movie which should have gone straight to DVD. First, it is a horribly written script - dialogue should do two things in film: reveal character, or advance the plot. Too many times did they have unnecessary scenes (the fire rescue followed by sex scene?) and dialogue which had nothing to do with the two points mentioned. The soundtrack of the movie was mostly songs from the 60's and 70's even though the movie ""takes place"" in the the 80's. They should have gone with a Hans Zimmer style of orchestra not the cheesy jimmy Hendrix all along the watch tower - it just doesn't fit in with the movie (none of the songs do), this isn't Forrest Gump it's a ""crime comic book drama"" if you can even call it that. Again with the dialogue, too many times are they telling you instead of showing you (visually or through dialogue) what they are doing or what is happening - the director doesn't give the audience enough credit. Take a look at the errors section for this movie, the list is endless more than most any other movie out there (I won't even go into all of those errors and how bad they make this film). Terrible acting overall too. Roarshach looked like a Danny Bonduce knock-off, and that mask he had was a ripoff from Batman begins (when he puts it on and is like ""tell me what you see"" to the doctor so dumb - trying to be like the scarecrow). And Billy Crudip the best actor in the movie we don't even know he's in it - because he's a blue guy with no emotion. Zack Snyder couldn't figure out if he wanted to make this like a comic book movie or a real drama action - and that really hur the movie. There are too many stupid little fight scenes that have no point in the end all product of the movie. In the end, you need more than a bunch of explosions and blood spilling to make a good film. Definitely one of the worst films I have ever seen. ",2009
6,"Let me preface this by saying I am a huge James Cameron fan. I think ""Terminator"" is a masterpiece of sci-fi and the single best edited film of all time, ""Aliens"" is easily the best sequel not from the original director and I personally like it a lot more than the original. ""Abyss"" created an interesting world and was racked with tension, ""Terminator 2"" is an action tour-de-force and has what I believe the best sound editing/design of all time, ""True Lies"" is goofy fun, more poignant than most give it credit for with a boffo ending, and finally ""Titanic"" was far better than anyone expected it to be and has one of the most believable romances in a movie.",2009
1,"I heard that this film was going to be the benchmark in modern film making. I heard this film was to be the largest grossing film of all time, and perhaps even the most captivating. As a film lover I could not miss it, and to make sure I didn't miss out on everything James Cameron had to offer me, I saw it in the largest iMax cinema in England, in 3d. ",2010
1,First I didn't want to go watch Avatar because when I heard Cameron took 3 weeks to write the plot I said to myself there is no hope for cinema anymore. And somehow people are showing me that I was right. I went to watch this piece of .... because I have been told it s unbelievable.,2009
6,"First of all, let me get it out of the way: yes, Avatar is visually stunning. With better scenario and dialogs, it could have been a very good movie; alas, it was completely predictable, and fancy special effects alone do not make a good movie.",2009
9,"Of course I had heard the hype over Avatar for a long time, but just refused to believe it for many reasons. It seemed very overrated at first glance, as it probably did to most, and I really didn't care to see if for awhile. Now, I am so glad that I gave it a chance, because Avatar turned out to be a visually beautiful, incredibly written and wonderfully executed work of art that indeed is my favorite movie of 2009 and one of the best movies I've ever seen, and that's without me viewing it in 3D!",2010
8,"I had the rather intense privilege to view James Cameron's much anticipated $400 million budget return to the directing scene, Avatar, at the Empire Leicester Square in London.",2009
1,"At the risk of repeating what countless others have said, this movie is blatant plagiarism. If a film student submitted the Avatar screenplay to an instructor, he/she would have been given an F. Colleges expel students for less obvious ripoffs than this. If you've watched Pocahontas or Dances With Wolves, you know the drill. The only difference is the ending, which has the pretty blue humanoids escorting humans to their Earth-bound ships at gunpoint, which I freely admit is a rather neat sight since my ancestors were American Indian, Irish, and Scot. As a result, I am perhaps overly sensitive to the plight of a civilization driven from their homeland and/or oppressed by a conquering nation - er, planet.",2010
1,"I have never been so close to leave the movie theater, as i was when seeing Avatar. Sure, it's very beautiful to look at, but, if you've seen the trailer, then you've seen the movie! It's basically every movie clichés put together in one horrible and so unoriginal movie. it's a mix of the ""last samurai"" meets ""Pocahontas"" meets ""Atlantis""! it's by far the most horrible storyline since Ed Woods' ""plan 9 from outer space"".",2009

1,"I realize I am probably going to get flames galore for this comment, and you all have the right to your opinion about my opinion, but hey, I'm entitled to my opinion too. Avatar is grade A crap. That's right, it's crap. I say this for one simple reason: Without the special effects this movie would never, ever captivate and take a hold of audiences like it has in the past week. Ask yourself this one question: If it didn't have the effects, the Navi plugging their hair into the trees like it's a damn broadband jack, mech suits(just like the ones in Matrix Revolutions) and barely futuristic ospreys, would you care about this movie at all? It's a truism when they say this movie is nothing more than Dances with Wolves in space. Some people may argue back that Star Wars borrowed from Hidden fortress, but at least it had enough compelling plot points to make it look different, such as I don't know... the force? The Death Star? Outer space? A location that has NOTHING at all to do with Earth? This important set of points clearly differentiates Star Wars and Hidden Fortress. But The difference between Avatar and Dances with wolves is... CGI. This CGI may be pretty but it cannot ever substitute for story and plot development. Speaking of, the characters save but a few are either very bland or stereotypes. The worst part is the story and the movie gives us no reason to care about the characters. You know what? I'll go one step further and say that the only difference between Avatar and a Star Wars prequel is this: Avatar has an environmental story that we can relate to. That's it. True, the action scenes in Avatar are well done, but hell, the action scenes in the Star Wars prequels were also arguably well-done. Still, there's that nagging lack of story development. Avatar is a huge let-down and doesn't belong on the best-of list of anybody with common sense.",2009
10,"I was lucky to see Avatar at a pre-screening a few hours ago. It completely blew me and the whole room away and i dare to say it will do so to 80% of any audience anywhere. The remaining 20%, who always finds something to complain about, will whine about character development, dialog, story or the pop-corn.",2009
10,"I saw this epic last night at the Empire Leicester Sq in London, which is a superb venue in which to view this film. Huge screen, excellent sound and an extraordinary Dolby, 3 dimensional image. The whole effect is mind blowing.",2009
9,"Nobody directs like James Cameron. Ten years in the works, and every minute was worth it. It is the Star Wars of the 21st century. Though the plot is derivative and bears some pretty close resemblance to Dances with Wolves and a little bit of The Last Samurai, it does not ruin a mind-blowing experience. Avatar has a great future ahead of it and, possibly another Oscar for the mighty James Cameron. ",2009
1,"I actually enjoyed this quite a bit, but I am giving it a 1, because I cannot believe that it deserves an 8.8, which is what it is getting this evening, mostly apparently due to suspicious ratings from countries like Slovakia, India and Australia. Not that I have anything against those countries, it just strikes me as odd that so few good reviews are coming from the United States. I'm not saying that IMDb's ratings are being manipulated by some sort of conspiracy, I am just saying it is odd. Anyways, rather than try and balance my review with what was good (the visuals, the 3D, the sound effects), am just going to say what really sucked. Can I say ""sucked"" in my review? Guess I will find out.",2009
9,"A film with the scope of James Cameron's Avatar was always going to be a risk both artistically and financially, especially in today's economic climate. Whether it will pay off monetarily is a question only time can answer, but this viewer can at the very least attest to it being an artistic triumph.",2009
9,"Forgive me, I'm going to jump from professional to fan boy for a while here. I haven't had the jitters after a film the way I've had for Avatar in quite sometime. James Cameron's Avatar is the most entertaining and enthralling cinematic experiences of my life. It is incredible, simply put. What Cameron has done here is the most passionate film project put out since Steven Spielberg released Schindler's List. His attention to detail and his zeal for pushing the envelope is so admirable to any filmmaker or actor who will ever do another film from this point on.",2009
9,"It has been 12 years since Cameron unleashed the phenomenon that was Titanic and real fans would have to look as far back as 1991's Terminator 2 for their last proper dose of his incredibly epic action (True Lies, while fun, really doesn't count).

4,"I simply cannot believe how over-zealous the users of this site are. Actually i can. It was exactly the same for There Will be Blood and every other hyped film there has been recently. Some of the adjectives used to describe Avatar beggar belief: 'The Best Movie of All Time' 'A Masterpiece' 'Mesmorising, Spellbinding, Extraordinary!'. I really do wish i could agree. I was looking forward to this as much as most and i'm a huge fan of Cameron's previous work. ",2009
1,"Sorry to not be with the masses on this one, but I would classify myself as being a little bit of a film buff in the sense that I've watched so many movies, even if I don't like them and know I won't, I'll still watch it out of interest. And this film actually made me LOL at my own criticisms as it was too easy to criticize. Story = humans want precious metal (or whatever), aliens occupy the area with said mineral, humans (americans actually) infiltrate in order to get, infiltrator betrays humans. uh-huh. Writing = absolutely trash, who wrote this again, oh, I'm sorry, I didn't look for his (camerons) name at the end because I can safely say it'll be the last of his films I'll watch. Honestly people, take a slight step back when watching this and you realize that he is writing for the uneducated adolescents who need stupid sentences to understand, or, hhhmm a three minute running scene to show ""how emotional it must have been for him to reuse his legs"", come on, as soon as he stood up I got it, BUT NO, 3 mins, corny heartwarming music, camera angles of his legs, then his smile, then his feet, then smile, then legs all the time with somebody shouting after him,n ""stop, you're not ready to run yet"". I mean, does this drivel really constitute as a 8.5 out of 10. Actually, I'm getting too annoyed now. Watch this film and imagine that it wasn't full of 1990's intro graphics from good PC games, imagine them as people acting, and hopefully you'll see some sense. I found one good idea in the film, that's the aliens can join up with the other animals/trees blah blah, but other than that, not one other original idea, I mean, even the female aliens, look just like the alien equivalent of human females, come on imaginations, where are you. Sorry James Cameron, I'm sorry that you made Terminator (which I find is great) and you've slowly gone downhill where you sell into the masses (who shoot in all probability, be shot) rather than trying to make a good film.",2010

8,I am sure my comment will be lost in a sea of blue but anyways here goes...,2009
1,"The plot is stolen from many different movies, there was only 3 good actors, the characters are either bland or stereotypical, and yet it made almost 3 billion. When I think a film is overrated I usually like it. I don't think of it as Oscar worthy, but I like it. Then there is Avatar a film I not only think is the most overrated film in history, but also on its own without the hype a terrible movie. It didn't have any effort put into the story at all. Star Wars took the ideas of many movies together to create something epic, but Avatar takes instead of being inspired by these things is just being lazy by stealing the ideas. It is an awful movie, but people and critics liked it. Why is that? Well that is due to the effects. Few watching, or reviewing cared about what the story was. All they cared about was the effects. Yes the effects and 3-D are great, but without the substance of a well written story it fails. I don't care if the effects are the best ever. Giving this film a good review based of the effects is like walking to your computer, and staring at the screensaver. You think it looks cool so you look at it. Next time you look up it is 3 hours later. Would consider that a good way to spend your time. No you would not, but you think that Avatar is worth your time. This a movie that is destroying filmmaking.",2010
1,"AHHHHHH, where do I start?! I am shocked by the amount of positive feedback this movie has got. I mean, it was filled with nonsense crap. I am trying to write this in the most civil way I can but that's seriously the only word that comes to my head when trying to describe this film: crap. I cant believe how many people actually loved this, I even feel bad for genuinely hating this movie.",2010
