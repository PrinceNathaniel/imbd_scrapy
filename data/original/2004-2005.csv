9,"LOST is a cool experimental TV series. It has been wrongly labeled as a simple concoction of well known stories (e.g. Lord of the flies, The beach). Due to its complexity, you feel lost at times.",2010
6,"This show could have been brilliant, if it hadn't spent so much time trying to convince us it was brilliant. The problem with Lost is that it does not come through on it's central premise--- to explain the unusual events on the island.",2010
4,"The finale to ""Lost"" failed on many levels, and not just because it did not answer questions. It was poor writing that was an emotionally manipulative, contrived, and done-before piece. I got it. I saw the different alternatives integrated into the characters' memories. I saw the after-life reunion that would bind them all together in eternity. But, the finale served to diminish the integrity of the entire series because SO MANY small questions were left unresolved. ",2010
9,"While originally reluctant to jump on the bandwagon of watching ""Lost"", I accidentally caught one episode at the beginning of season 1the one with the polar-bearand it has had my undivided attention ever since. The show, that is. Not the polar bear. So bear (heh) with me while I throw out as much rambling, semi-coherent praise as I can muster.",2006
1,"A TV series that started with real promise & potential, plummeted — losing a good deal of steam and momentum, and ultimately was rendered completely pointless from leaving so many ""loose ends"" and not providing any real answers nor resolution.",2011
10,"I love this show!  It's like watching a mini movie each week!!!  The first episode was so gripping and terrifying...so was part 2 of the  pilot...  I'm definitely gonna keep tuning into this show!  This is the real Survivor!  I've looked at a few of the other comments and I can see that already  after just one or two episodes the morons here are already crying  wolf...  Sorry if it's not another reality show, kiddies!  There was once a time where there were...now brace yourself! Actual TV  shows!  And this one is actually good unlike most of the crappy sitcoms today  or the ump-teenth carbon copy of a Law & Order or NYPD Blue or CSI  series they're dishing out...  Watch this yourself to form your own opinion, don't take one from the  boneheads here!",2004
1,I'LL START WITH THE OBVIOUS THE BACK AND FORWARD THING IS EXTREMELY Irritating ,2012
10,"Lost, probably the best t.v series ever made. the storyline is clever and when all your questions are answered watching one episode, 100 more are raised. if lost can carry on it's magnificent ways and not get too carried away then it will be stapled the best show ever. The survivors of a plane crash are forced to live with each other on a remote island, a dangerous new world that poses unique threats of its own. after reading this your thinking how on earth can that be interesting? and heres your answer, every season SO FAR has always been full of surprises, your always questioning your self why did that just happened and what's gonna happen next each time, very unexpected thing's happen and the story goes on wonderfully SO FAR! The series just sucks you in, it's chilling and very addictive, everything from the wonderful creators and directing to the magnificent performances by the cast creates a very believable story. Lost is simply unbelievable, amazing, highly entertaining, top notch, t.v at it's best.How ever you want to put it. ",2009
3,"This show was possibly the best thing on T.V. and it could have been for another few decades had it been more properly thought out. Lost was something different, something intoxicating. Week after week you'd tune in to see the trials and tribulations of all these random characters that had been thrown together under mysterious circumstances. The characters were superb but the best character of all was the setting itself: The island, what was it and why were they all there. You were dying to find out what the island was or why they were all there but the way it was built up it almost felt as if 'Lost' would reveal the answers to life. I would've been happy however with a more suitable ending, something that actually fit the story and the mythology they had created. It was a beautifully constructed but fragile house of cards that came violently tumbling down as soon as the writers revealed in the last ten minutes of the show that they never really knew where the heck this was going. This show deserved a better ending and we as the fans deserved some absolution. The show needless to say did not deliver and I would not in my wildest dreams recommend this to someone I'm friends with simply because it leaves you hurting and looking for a way to rationalize it and make sense of something senseless. Over all 'Lost' was a giant six year troll and you're better off not wasting your time. They did with this what was done to 'The Matrix' franchise. If you want to see something that leaves you guessing and questioning but actually seems feasible after all the clues you've been given watch ""Inception"", ""Donie Darko"", ""Jacob's Ladder"", ""The Fountain"", ""Vanilla Sky""; at least those are two hour movies and they add up in the end, this show went on for six years and all you wanted were some answers only to find there were none to give. This was over all an incoherent piece of bad writing.",2010
6,(this may contain spoilers so do not read on if you haven't seen it),2011
6,"Where do pressing questions go if they want to remain unanswered forever? They go LOST... :) - Mysteries have a tendency in LOST to appear to be of major importance, even seemingly let the world depend on them (sometimes quite literally!), while in fact there's not really much there that deserves thinking it through. That's the sad truth after the curtain went down on this show after a mostly extremely bland final season. Even the iconic moments the show definitely featured during the first seasons to a great deal become meaningless on retrospect. Even main characters that were set up as key players in the grand scheme of things turn out to have no clue whatsoever eventually. So the authors choose not to reveal too much as they go along, just tease, keep things interesting and suspenseful with immense cliffhangers and what not, yet often let mysteries die due to old age after some seasons have passed.",2010
1,"What can only be described, as the Ultimate Screen Writers Nightmare or Revenge, ""Lost"" has achieved the ""ignominious"" title as ""Nuttiest TV Show of All Time !"" Even crazier than the movie ""Tootsie!"" ",2010
1,"To anybody considering giving this TV series a go, I would suggest you don't waste your time. I persevered until well in to the second season - and basically all it was was unanswered question after unanswered question - a crude formula in my opinion to drag out a story which never had any bones to begin with. I read somewhere that the show's writers themselves didn't even know where the story was going - I laughed so loud! I'm all for an intriguing narrative, but for as long as I followed this it was a series of unanswered questions - one ridiculous suggestion would be unanswered and quickly replaced by another equally ridiculous suggestion, which wow, would be unanswered! And so on and on. It was an absolute farce in my opinion, and a crude structure designed simply, along with the hype and marketing, to keep people watching in the expectation that 'it will all come together soon!' 'it has to!'. Don't be surprised if it never does",2014
4,"When the pilot of this show was broadcasted, I was astonished. I still think it's one of the best ever. Intriguing, thrilling, extremely well shot. As the story started to develop throughout the first ten episodes, the show kept the pace. Some story lines seemed to have been left behind, but everything appeared to make sense.",2007
1,Lost is just awful. The viewer sees more pieces than the characters and so is frustrated when they stumble about from one disaster to another - all because the characters don't talk to each other.,2007
10,"Once in a while, there comes along a TV drama series that makes you glad the medium was invented.  A series that makes you glad to be alive; a series that breaks your heart that you have to wait a whole week to see the next episode.  Shameless is such a series.",2004
10,"I'm not a great authority on this, as I hardy watch TV any more. If they came up with more stuff like this, I would be addicted to the Box. Fantastic script, characters and acting and the funniest, freshest British made comedy I've seen since Spaced and (to a slightly lesser extent) The League of Gentlemen.",2004
10,"Co-written by the writer behind 'Clocking Off', This is one the most stand-out, must-see series British television has produced. The exploits of the Gallagher family are no-holds-barred and guaranteed to either offend the viewer, or cause them to slide off their chair and roll around the floor, laughing their behinds off.",2005
10,"I can't comprehend how people can give this a bad review. It is without doubt one of the best shows on the TV and is comparable to Nighty Night, League of Gentlemen and possibly Little Britain, when it comes to blacker than black humour. The characters are sublimely developed with Frank, the hapless father being one of, if not the main character. He is a horrible man with questionable morals and less than a day's work behind him in his life. He has 8 children to support and is supported himself by his beautiful yet eccentric wife. It is Franks tale of partying, avoiding work and generally being the worst father in the world. If you don't like this, you don't know what's funny.",2005
10,"Definitely the best series i have ever seen on TV. Non stop Laughing all the way through. the realism of the program is great and allows a lot of people to actually relate to it. i would recommend everyone should watch this and hopefully enjoy it as much as i have. the characters are fantastic, frank is hilarious! there are also the characters who you befriend throughout the series, like Lip and Ian. the story lines have been fantastic and each one has left you wanting to see what happens in the next episode. this program is a definite 'thumbs up' and hopefully there will be a second series with all the same characters, because i am sure people would welcome the return of the show.",2004
10,"""Shameless"" began a couple of nights ago on SBS TV - supposedly an ethnic channel (are Mancunian's ethnic, then??) - in Australia, with no warning, no fanfare. I was blown fair out of my chair by this show, and possibly appreciated it all the more because I had no expectations, although once I noted Paul Abbott's name under 'writer' I knew I was in for something special. His scripts for 'Clocking Off' and 'Linda Green' were, like 'Shameless', both sharp and original. Dialogue is quick and relevant, characters are drawn immediately, and altogether the script treats the viewer as an intelligent participant in the hilarious, and often poignant, exploits of the Gallagher family. Dad Gallagher, always a bit the worse for wear on drugs or alcohol (or both) is raging around the room talking rubbish, and Fiona, eldest child, explains to her posh boyfriend that her Dad's ecstasy dealer is a schizophrenic, like that explains everything. Perhaps it does...... If you get the chance to see this, then don't miss it.",2005
10,"After clicking on this website and reading the completely rubbish review by someone which everyone supposedly must read before doing anything else-I thought I better tell everyone that it is completely wrong! Shameless is brilliant, series 2 has just started and I recommend everyone to watch it.",2005
3,As an avid viewer of Shameless since series one I have noticed a gradual deterioration of the quality over the last two series (my rating is for series 6 and 7). I have now reached the point where I can no longer bear to watch wondering what horror show they will put on display next.,2010
8,"Paul Abbott's last drama, 'State of Play', was an ultra-serious (and ultra-good) political thriller.  For this, his follow-up, he has made what at first viewing appears to be a bizarre choice, making a drama about working class life that superficially resembles an extended version of Harry Enfield's 'Slobs' sketches, only with added sex and violence.  But as you get used to the program, its appeal grows.  Human stain Frank Gallacher, the awful family patriarch, rumbles on in the background, pretty much ignored by everyone else, who've all rumbled that he's just a waste of space. Meanwhile, they try to make the best of what he has left of their lives. Fast paced and funny, it's infinitely more entertaining than stolid dramas like 'Family Business' (screened at the same time on another channel).",2004
10,"I think the only thing that can be said about Shameless is that it is simply THE best Drama that has been on TV in years. America has produced TV shows which have bowled over audiences for years, such as The Sopranos, Oz and Homicide whilst we have to put up with year upon year of rubbish, with the odd classic such as Robbie Coltrane's Cracker to relieve the banality. From the first episode of Shameless I was hooked. The Characters, humour, acting, stories, script and dialogue are fantastic, and I cannot understand how anyone can slag this excellent show. I was so looking forward to the Christmas special, and whilst there was a serious tone with Ian's plight, I think there was always a serious undertone to the whole 1st series, and that is what makes good comedy drama, rather than just comedy.",2005
10,"This has to be one of the best drama's this year, it may only be going into it's third episode but I'm totally hooked. This drama is also like a comedy as well and has a few funny bit's. This is an enjoyable show for everyone. I give it 10/10.",2004
10,"What I am doing reviewing each series for how they did and their downfalls. I will be deeply analyzing Shameless, and the end I'll simply place a verdict.",2013
10,"Shameless is the funniest show on TV. The Gallagher kids have a chronic drunk as a father and a self-pitying mother who deserted them, instead of falling apart they have successfully stayed together and retained a close bond. It would be so easy to have made a show using the same characters and turned it into some sad soap opera portraying them as depressed poverty stricken people who would never achieve anything, instead all the characters are intelligent, extremely funny, creative and determined to succeed. Reading this back it doesn't do the show justice - you need to see it to appreciate it. Its hard to even to be mad at Frank who can be such a jerk but obviously loves his kids and Sheilia who is very kind and as nutty as a fruit cake. The neighbours Kev, Veronica and Marty are the best neighbours you could get (I'd love to live in their neighbourhood). People who are offended by bad language, sex and naked bums should go and get a life. You can not miss this show its the best of the best of the best.",2006
10,"Anyone who don't find this funny need their head examened... I mean it This is the funniest thing made in a very long time. Not only that for once a show that isent scared and don't take itself seriously... And what fab characters: Frank-A total waste of life lol says a lot of things but they rarely make any sense Sheila-I laugh my head of...Scared or everything, lives in her own world and takes more meds then I can count Fiona-Cute and sweet you so want everything to go well for her Veronica-My favourite. Totally mad Kev-You just want to kiss him... Lip-Makes up for his nickname Ian-Gay and scared of coming out...Played brilliantly for an actor who makes his debut Debbie-Reminds me of me when I was little. Just the little sister you'd like to have And all the rest...Carl, Kash, Yvonne, Carol, Marty, Lillian and Hippi Pete they are all amazing and played but some of Englands best I take this over any American comedy any day....Hey I'll take any UK show over any American any day but whatever :)",2006
1,"It's a one trick pony, offend as many people as you can over and over again and again and again.... It's like some comedians who are not funny so they rely on bad language and blue humor for their laughs. I like gritty plots, I like working class northern English dramas (that's me too), but this is just tripe. I know some people love it, my cousin is hooked on it. The acting isn't that great although I do have to say that take some characters away and it could be better. I'm not an expert, but that's my opinion. Also I didn't give it a chance, I bought the first season DVD, watched half of it, got bored and gave it to a friend. Who knows maybe I'm missing out. For those who love it, great,we all like different things.",2009
8,I love Shameless. I didn't watch the first series and have watched all of the second series and I love it. It's basically about the British equivalent to white trash (Chavs).,2005

10,"This movie gives us what we all secretly wish for-- a chance to forget something that's hurt us in the past. The viewer can almost live vicariously through the two dysfunctional characters that are remarkably just like ordinary people. The relationship problems are the same. The little fights and bickers are things we all can relate to. The acting was amazing- throughout the movie, I actually forgot that I was watching Mr. Ace Ventura himself. Carrey and Winslet pull off a great performance, both ditching the typecasts that they've been shackled with. Not only did the film give us the opportunity to see what it was like if painful memories were erased, but it also gave us the opportunity to see that everything deserves a second chance. The way it ends leaves the viewer to imagine how the characters' lives will end. The idealist may say that they lived happily ever after; the pessimist may say that they just reverted to disliking each other again. Either way, it leaves you to imagining your own ending; a characteristic many films leave out. Basically, this movie makes you think, ""What if...?"" It truly gives new meaning to the phrase ""You never know what you've got until it's gone.""",2004
10,"Michel Gondry, credited as the director and co-writer of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, is only partly responsible for the success that the film achieves. He implements a awe-inspiring blend of style to a story that is perfectly non-linear. But then there is also the madman genius of the current screen writing plane- Charlie Kaufman- who has written three of the most ingenious, funny, and human of ""little"" Hollywood movies (Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind). ",2004
10,"After a lukewarm reception in 2001 with ""Human Nature"", Charlie Kaufman has teamed up with director, Michel Gondry again for this romatic fantasy. With a name like Jim Carrey, this second collaboration couldn't go wrong in terms of box office success, and nor should it as this film is quite simply brilliant.",2004
9,"It happens to both the best and worst of us at some time in our lives. Love . If you haven't experienced this yet just wait, you will. It is inevitable that at some time in our journey through life that we will come across someone that fascinates us so profoundly that we feel as though we could spend the rest of our lives with this magnetic individual. There is no exact science to the concept of love. Many believe that the idea of love goes beyond the reasonable or the logical to a more diverse level of the illogical, irrational, and the unreasonable. Why is it that we find ourselves attracted to people that, on the surface, seem as though they would never be compatible with our own lifestyle? Why is it that when we do fall in love with a certain individual and think at first that this is a perfect match, we find over time that less tolerable marks are more frequent on the surface? And why is it that we overlook some individuals that, although at first there is no real 'love connection' per say, we seem to have a somewhat pure liking for someone and that it takes us longer then it should to see that person for who they really are to us? Love is a complicated subject that can't be taught, it can only be experienced for what it is . utterly confusing and yet at the same time completely fulfilling.",2004
10,"There's only one way to describe ""Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind"": perfect. It's been one week since I saw the movie and I still cannot stop thinking about it. Was the ending happy or sad? I cannot tell, but it's deeply touching.",2004
10,Very nicely crafted science fiction love story. More of an experience than a film.,2006
10,"Joel (Jim Carrey) is a rather milquetoast man who meets up with free spirit Clementine (Kate Winslet), and they become romantically involved. However, they endure a messy breakup and Clementine goes to a business called Lacuna, Inc., where she has all of her memories of Joel erased. Not wanting to be left out, Joel also goes to have his memory erased. However, soon after it begins, Joel realizes that he wants to keep the memory of Clementine, so he tries to reverse the process.",2005
10,"Here's the basic plot. Clemintine and Joel have a long, rocky relationship. Clemintine decides to get Joel erased from her memory, so Joel decides to do the same, only while Joel is in the process of the erasing, he comes back around to the really sweet, nice memories, and realizes that he wants out of the procedure. Now here's what I thought about it. ",2004
10,this is my favorite movie of 2004 and definitely one of the top in my all-time favorite lists! ,2004
10,"I had no idea what Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was about until the end of March. I had heard some small rumblings about it around the Internet for a few months, and also saw a few short TV trailers for it, but that was about it. Basically, all I knew was it was another dramatic Jim Carrey film, written by the same guy who wrote two of the weirdest and somehow great films to come out in a long time, Being John Malkovich and Adaptation. But does this film succeed to be just as weird yet excellent as the other two? Or is it even better? A big yes on both counts would be highly appropriate.",2004
10,"That is the question underlying this entire movie, since two-thirds of it is the process of elimination of a man's memories in order to forget the person who caused him some hurt in the recent past.",2005
6,"""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" may be a contender for most pretentious movie title of all time, but at least the film is not as bad. Actually, it has a couple good moments and Kate Winslet delivers a serious contender for career-best performance. Nice to see her nominated for an Oscar here. Jim Carrey is not on the same level, but still very good and it would have been nice to see him nominated too. For anything. What a joke the Academy has still not nominated him for his many great performances. Unfortunately, this is also almost all positive I can say. The film was directed by Michel Gondry and also written by him together with Charlie Kaufman. The duo won an Oscar for the film's script. I certainly prefer Gondry's ""L'écume des jours"".",2016
9,"""How happy is the blameless vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each prayer accepted, and each wish resigned."" - Alexander Pope Is ignorance truly bliss? And if you could erase a person, what would the consequences be? ""Eternal Sunshine"" answers these questions, in a way that most Hollywood movies could not. Michel Gondry and Charlie Kaufman have created one of the most original, touching, funny, and unique films of recent years. It explores the mind and the heart, deeper than other movies have dared to do.",2005
10,"There's absolutely no way I can write about this film without a spoiler, as I think, judging from the comments written up on this site, many seem to have difficulty following the plot. As a general guide, if you're having difficulty following the chronological order of the scenes, it's necessary to follow the changes in color of Clementine's (Kate Winslet) hair. It starts off green, then changes to orange and finally finishes up blue. In the film though, it starts off blue, then goes to orange (the predominant color), then green and then back to blue.",2005
10,"Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind is a love story about two lovers who undergo a procedure to erase each other from one another's memories, but when they meet after their memory is gone, there is something strange still drawing them together and it is also during that memory wipe that they realize how precious their relationship really was.",2014
1,"This is the filmic equivalent of being stuck in a room with someone who thinks they have the most emotionally upsetting life imaginable and is doing everything in their power to persuade you they are truly tortured and pitiable. By the end of both experiences you just want to go home and feel utterly relieved you aren't so arrogant. Or you wish you were able to erase your own memory. (Sorry, a cheap film tie-in metaphor already.)",2004
1,"Despite my desire to enjoy what I hoped would be a unique film, I found it dark and self indulgent.  The superb acting couldn't overcome a script that is centered on a failed relationship that never makes sense to the viewer or to the lovers.  In the end you feel like this is ""Adaptation II"" - yet another film about a brooding self-centered guy who can't really relate to anyone beyond his own fantasy life.  The dramatic device ultimately used in the film of having the main character fight to preserve his memory fails because it comes across as a clever but unsatisfying rendition of psychotherapy.  The subplot is banal and adolescent.  In many ways this entire film comes across as something that was done back in the 60's, but which now falls flat.",2004
1,POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD,2004
10,"Now... those of you who haven't seen this, would probably go in to this movie with extremely high standards, and I don't blame you. This movie has seriously been recommended, and welcomed by critics. After seeing it for the first time, I understand why.",2004
1,"(Spoiled...) Like the rest of Kaufman's self-absorbed hallucinations, Eternal Sunshine fails to jump the ""who cares"" hurdle. What an overwrought mess of a movie. As far as that mind-surgery-memory-deleting helmet goes, why in tarnation was Jim Carrey's character--a self-described uninteresting bore--so very talented at resisting the program? No mental giant, he would have succumbed immediately. End of movie. But no! We replay this deja vu game of meeting forgotten lovers into infinity, while every character gets thrown into stylistic outer space: Comedy for some, tragedy for others, sex farce when Mr. Kaufman runs out of ideas. Actually, apart from Sunshine's tangled structure, there are no ideas. Not once are we given useful, relevant information about anyone who inhabits the film. Carrey and Winslet's megawatt dual-presence is wasted inside of a situation that resembles a hamster cage, not a story. Only Tom Wilkinson, as the memory-deleting helmet inventor, seems to grasp the danger of what's happening. Kaufman, however, surrounds him with a gang of assistants who are giggling morons. What a sad, confused, irrelevant film. I was reminded more than once of the forgotten French mind-game films of the sixties. Marienbad, anyone?",2004
8,"If there's anything this movie proves, it is the difficulty in separating the series from the demands of fans. This is clear just from hearing some of the comments. ""Why didn't they identify the names on the Marauder's Map?"" ""Why wasn't the second Quidditch game shown?"" ""Why wasn't there more of Crookshanks the Cat?"" By focusing on what the film didn't have, fans fail to look at the film on its own terms. I think this is by far the best Harry Potter movie yet.",2004

He runs away after using magic to inflate Uncle Vernon's sister Marge who was being offensive towards Harry's parents.

However, he soon learns that a dangerous criminal and Voldemort's trusted aide Sirius Black has escaped from the Azkaban prison and wants to kill Harry to avenge the Dark Lord. To worsen the conditions for Harry, vile shape-shifters called Dementors are appointed to guard the school gates and inexplicably happen to have the most horrible effect on him.

After all, as we float through this empty, depressing world, sometimes all we have is hope.

The tale opens with yet another killer title sequence, this time bringing the familiar Warner Bros. shield to light in spurts before focusing on Harry's 'homework assignment,' if you will --- the Lumos Maxima spell. After this, we come to the first segment of the story proper. Now aged 13, Harry is angrier, and more unsure of his destiny than in his previous adventures at Hogwarts.

10,"Prisoner of Azkaban is the only installment of the Harry Potter series to stray from the formula ""Voldemort is trying to kill Harry"". That's one of the reasons I liked this movie so much. It lacks the sense of impending peril present in ""Sorceror's Stone"" and ""Chamber of Secrets"" and the lack of oppressive atmosphere allows for the most complete (as of movie 4) character exploration of the entire series.",2005
2,"Meant to update this a long while back. But the movie itself got me so de-motivated, that I didn't even bother to rank it. Some moments in the movie were good - but only thanks to CGI wizardry - nothing original at all in the movie or even the story! Total crap. If I did not care to give regards to the millions of HP-fans, I'd even rank it the lowest 1. The original HP movie was the best in the series, but only because it was new (-sort of) in its genre. All sequels just lack the depth. They only rely on visual tricks to awe the audience. All shine, no ground. This is a plain kids movie - kids who need little to get awed at. I can get equals thrills and probably indulge in more intelligence more whilst watching even Thirteen Ghosts.",2005
2,"Give up! Are the only words of support I can lend to the cast and crew. Dreadful translation from book to script and even more so from script to screen. The films get marked down time after time because Daniel Radcliffe makes a meal of it! An absolute travesty. He cannot act, he loves himself and he is so evidentially unable to act. He pulls the film down. He improves with practise and with each film but his performances are always dire. 1- Dreadful 2- Poor and 3- Below Average. 4 was probably- Below Average. By the next film he should be Average. He is improving but the quality and lack of passion in his performance was a dread and a bore, quite frankly so get some acting tips and and use them.",2005
8,"This work is beautifully dark and lovingly done, but it does leave gaping holes in J. K. Rowling's magical world. The close relationship between Harry and Dumbledore is obliterated, as is Hermione's almost conspiratorial relationship with McGonagal. You are never told who Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs are (a necessary element). They completely avoid the fact that Snape has knowledge of Harry's Invisibility Cloak, and Harry received the Firebolt at the beginning of this work rather than the end. The whole incident at the Shrieking Shack was changed and lost too much in the translation. Crookshanks was calumniated from a beloved kneazle to a noisome feline who'd be more likely to pee in your shoes than help you, aside of course from his determination to eat Scabbers.",2005
10,"POA was by far the best of the three Harry Potter films. The actors (Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint) have gained more confidence in their abilities. They have become more and more like the characters they play in their own life which has shown in the films.",2005
7,"Like most Harry Potter fans, I found this movie disappointing. I felt that Director Alfonso Cuaron choose style over substance, which is never a good thing in a movie.",2004
4,"Listen, I understand that to make a movie from a book you have to leave things out. However, I believe that if a movie is going to made from a book, it should stand on its own. Meaning that you should be able to follow the movie if you haven't read the book. I have read the book, but I saw the movie with people who had not. And we got out of the movie and they were thoroughly confused. And I don't blame them, because the movie failed to explain (1) how Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban, (2) how he knew that Pettigrew was Ron's pet and therefore at Hogwarts, and (3) who the 4 Marauders were so it was confusing that Lupin understood what the map was and how it worked. This is just sloppy film making. Add a few lines here and there and it's explained. I can live without the Quiddich and the subplots from the book, but when I have to spend 15 minutes explaining things to people after the movie, the movie is a failure.",2007
7,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a ""fan film"". By this I mean the makers have made the assumption the majority of viewers, the core audience - are fans of the Potter series. As a stand alone film would leave a viewer confused by a fast moving plot devoid of a lot of detail contained in the original book which the film quite closely follows. To fully appreciate the movie, prior knowledge through reading the book would be most beneficial, it would allow you to fill in the many blanks.",2004
10,"If there is a scene that sums up my feelings about this film, it would probably be where Harry is forced to ride Buckbeak the hippogriff (""Don't pull out his feathers,"" warns Hagrid, ""cause he won't thank yer for that!""). Initially, Harry hangs on for dear life, but as the flight progresses over Hogwarts and its nearby lake, Harry suddenly feels a sense of complete exhilaration.",2010
1,"My opinion of the recently released Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban is that the new director totally changed the mood and feeling of the Harry Potter series. Those of you who watched PoA and read the book saw many things cut out, I am aware that a lot had to be cut out for time reasons but in doing this many things were lost that were important in the storyline. An Example of this is how Heromine was able to attend all her classes this was shown briefly in two scene and could have easily been missed. Another thing that was troubling was why was the scenery of the movie changed. The grounds of Hogwarts were totally different than the first two movies.I believe that the change of director could have turned off many Harry Potter fans from the movies. As for myself I enjoyed the first two films and did not like the third. I do very much though enjoy the books and also I hope that the the next movie will be a little better put together.",2004
10,"One of the best new shows in the last few years. Entourage brings the lifestyle of the young and famous in a likable sharply written easy to take in way. The key to this show is the writing, always witty and hard hitting. The writer's don't tame it down, it makes it easy to believe these are real people and gets you connected to the cast quickly. The realism of the series and the great guest stars they get is also a wonderful treat (sara foster, Scarlett Johanson, Jaime Presley, Ali larter to name a few). Ari Gold the super-agent is rapidly becoming one the most recognizable characters on HBO series with his hilarious lines and over the top antics. WATCH THIS SHOW!",2005
10,"With a full season now out of the way, as a whole, I am definitely impressed with what I've seen over the last 8 weeks. I like all five of the main characters and believe all the actors to have done a good job at portraying these guys. A special nod, of course, goes out to Piven for what he's done with Ari and the same for Kevin Dillon as Drama. I realize a lot of people don't buy Grenier as 'Vinny' (to quote Ari), but I think he plays him well. Same with Ferrara as Turtle. This guy may act like a loud-mouth goof ball most of the time he's in front of the camera, but I definitely see Queens coming from him. And then there's Eric, the ""cynic"" of the group. He may be cynical, but he's also very practical and seems to be the sole reason that things haven't fallen apart up at the mansion. He keeps them all in line and makes the decisions for Vince. A very cool character indeed.",2004
10,this show is the real deal and i enjoy very much. so i don't know what all you other people are talking about. its not cliché.. its a straight up entertaining well written show! so enjoy. stop hating..everyone cast in the show are good actors and new yorkers!! so that counts for something too. everyone i knew liked that show and thought it was one of the funniest shows. Ari's character was hysterical and non stop humor. Vince chase was laid back and cool. turtle was a little fat pimp who was funnier than anybody. Matt Dillon's little brother is so funny. The whole story and concept of the show seems very realistic to me and very enjoyable.,2005
1,"after reading a lot of ""Hilarious!"" about this show around the net, and how Piven is a comedic turbine here I decided to give Entourage a go. Well that will teach me how not to trust internet people. I've watched the first two seasons and I don't think I've ever seen another successful show in which every single character is an unsympathetic moron, jokes are high school level and unfunny to the maximum, plots are incredibly repetitive and actors are really, really, REALLY bad. This show gets 9.2 here in IMDb, and it makes me wonder about the average IQ present in this site. Every single show starts off one of two ways; there are very few exceptions: either ""E"" gets a wake-up telephone call from Ari Gold, who's douching it up on a golf course or something, or the four guys (E, Vince, Drama, and Turtle) hang out in the kitchen, engaging in witless, poorly-written banter while Drama cooks breakfast. Vince will be confused about something, Turtle will make a remark about banging some hoes, and Drama will get defensive about something and reference an old acting gig. Keep in mind that this last for about two or three minutes, which amounts to roughly 1/10th of the show. And people like this? And finally, there's Ari Gold, the boastful, obnoxious agent who treats everyone around him like crap. Like Drama, it's the same thing with Ari every episode: he kissed Vince's ass, makes some dumb jokes about Lloyd's knees being dirty, delivers half of his lines with the palms of his hands together and placed under his bottom lip, and delivers the other half with his arms spread and a big, stupid grin on his arrogant face. And for all this the guy won an Emmy? Whatever. If you do enjoy Entourage, that's just fine and dandy. I hope you enjoy the upcoming season. For me, though, it's redundant, amateur crap",2009
3,"Entourage is about up-and-coming actor Vince Chase (Adrian Grenier) and the people he pays to follow him around the dirty business world of Hollywood (Eric, his best friend/ manager; Ari, his hot-tempered agent; Jonny Drama, his brother, and for some reason also a hanger-on; and Turtle, whose main role seems to be making remarks that would get you kicked out of class in high school).",2006
1,"After hearing some good things about this show and seeing its rating on IMDb, I decided to check it out. After watching Season 1, I have concluded that this is a bad program. It's boring, the characters are unlikeable, and it portrays women in a way that makes me genuinely sad.",2008
1,"As many people have said before, the only aspect of ""Entourage"" worth seeing is Jeremy Piven, who has never failed to disappoint.",2006
9,"Entourage is a TV series which is vaguely based on Mark Wahlberg's life in Hollywood. Vincent Chase played by the very charming Adrian Grenier is a young and in demand film star. He's represented by Ari Gold, a ruthless agent determined to be the most powerful person in Hollywood. Jeremy Piven plays the role of Ari Gold brilliantly, and admits to have taken many attributes for this character from a real Hollywood agent named Ari Emanuel.",2015
6,"If you like watching shallow and superficial do shallow and superficial stuff, while goofing off and keeping the career afloat. This might be the show for you. It's actually entertaining and funny for a while but gets kinda tedious after few seasons in. And the guys are likable for the most part for guys that are part of a entourage. It even has some clever parts. The constant running on greed doesn't leave a good aftertaste though. Overall, the show is alright. Despite few entertaining elements, it's a tedious show. Personally I think the show is a bit overrated.",2013

2,"The show consists of good characters, except for Drama, and relies on a steady brand of related themes. The Mandy Moore scenario was drawn out and an obvious play on attracting a popular name. The screenwriters fall victim to the common error of addressing audience demands. Opinion polls rank certain characters over others and they attempt to exploit that fact into interesting plots. As far as what is out there, Entourage is fun to watch and the easiest to relate to.",2006

10,"I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that as a spin off, Atlantis has done much more than its parent series, Stargate SG1, by introducing a new cast of characters who give us more of what the essence of Stargate is - funny, serious, sad, and epic at the same time.",2008
9,"Having only seen a few episodes of 'Stargate: Atlantis' and given it is a young show, I have to say that while it may not be on the same level as 'Stargate: SG1', it is enjoyable in itself.

1,"I'd think of it as being a merely geeky series. The story would be the only thing keeping the viewer going. Everything else is pretty flat.

Sure, I caught the odd episode of The Next Generation or The X Files as a kid and may have even enjoyed the seemingly ridiculous goings on of the fantasy fiction world. I was finally converted to a fully fledged fan of this genre after both watching Battlestar Galactica and completing the game Mass Effect (which I'd love to see a series of!) Anyway, I was given the Atlantis DVD boxset and encouraged to soak up the franchise. I expected to casually watch an episode here or there when I had little else to do. Perhaps after ordering a 12 inch pizza from the local take away I'd stick an episode on. Maybe even a quick 'before bed' routine I could get into.

6,"As all versions of the Stargate scenario, roles were well portrayed, some episode plots were not even half bad, but as a whole the scheme was totally unrealistic. Get a grasp on reality, ancient pyramids being landing pads for alien space ships, the Gao'uld having the kind of foothold they had on earth would have never left, or went into hiding. I remember the episode where Lt. Col. Shepherd and his team stumble upon that ancient ship, did not seem that advanced, certainly not anymore so than an Asgard mother ship. As for the ancients themselves witnessing Shepherd's interaction with the security detail they did not seem to intelligent. Now for the ancients and their non-interference policy, talk about hypocrisy, they are indirectly responsible for creating the Wraith, and directly responsible for the creation of the Replicators, but after they ascend do they clean up their mess, no they leave that problem for others. As for re-evolving does anyone realize how impractical and improbable that is a race evolves once, if it is wiped out as is the case with all fauna and flora they are permanently extinct. Can genetic material be introduced into biosphere and evolve to resemble those whose DNA it originally came from, yes but even physical characteristics would be different varying on the environmental conditions the subject was exposed to.

Why it always comes to that there is a minimal chance to survive, but against all statistics, time after time it comes to that no team member really die? I'm sorry, if you are not a true fan of an American action (with happy endings), avoid this series. There are some characteristics that make one hope things will change in time, but NO IT DOESN'T!

9,"The teen-movie genre returns with ""Mean Girls,"" and it comes back with a vengeance. What could have been a tired and clichéd retread of ""Heathers"" is actually a clever and witty flick thanks to the talents of screenwriter Tina Fey. Fey, head writer for ""Saturday Night Live"" and co-anchor of their ""Weekend Update,"" has an amazing flair for satire, and what better way to showcase it than with a analytical glimpse at the world of high school cliques? Lindsay Lohan is Cady, the previously home-schooled daughter of two zoologists, growing up in the African wilderness while Mom and Dad conduct their research. When the 'rents decide to settle down, Cady gets her first taste of public schooling, which is almost as wild as the jungles and safaris she's used to. Cady is introduced to the different factions that populate the cafeteriaincluding the nympho band geeks, the nerdy Asians, the cool Asians, the varsity jocks and of course, the Plastics, teen royalty led by the manipulative Regina George (Rachel McAdams).",2005

As someone newly out of high school, I can tell you that the high school clicks portrayed in this film are a bit far-fetched.

This movie is still simply witty and smart with a story line that is far different from the main stream movies that come out today.",2017

Janis tells Cady all about Regina George (Rachel McAdams) the queen-bee and star as Damian puts it, and her two little workers, the very rich and popular Gretchen Weiners (Lacey Chabert) and dim-witted but very sweet Karen Smith (Amanda Seyfried) and tells her to quote on quote ""beware of the plastics"" after giving her a lunch-time guide.

Sure there are exceptions, but I knew the queen-bees in high school. They never changed. They stayed mean all through high school and out into the real world. I see them wandering around town years later and they're just as mean as they were back then. When they're mean in high school, they usually don't change.

The Notebook tells the story of a summer romance that turns into a romance never to be forgotten. Allie and Noah are the two lead characters and they are wonderful. You immediately fall in love with the characters and you want to follow every step of their doomed love story. it is one of the greatest love stories ever told. Look out for the lake scene, unbelievable! I came out of the cinema wanting to go back in again and watch it all over again. It feels like you are reading a diary watching this film, thats how detailed and wonderful this film is. Cannot really give too much away about the story, all I can say is if you haven't seen this film yet, be sure to see it. I cannot think of a film more perfect for Valentines Day!",2005
10,"Often times when a movie comes from source material such as a novel that did well, the people who were fans of the book end up not liking the movie as much. Sometimes those same fans even end up hating the movie, or not even giving it a chance by seeing it. Such was the case, that I already knew the ending of Nicholas Sparks's novel even before I got into the theater. Let me clear up though, that the best thing about the film was that I ended up getting wrapped in the story on the screen, rather than sitting there thinking to myself what part of the story should be coming next. That is what makes a great adaptation, when you can get lost in the story, and forget about your thoughts, or what is going on in the outside world. Not only that, but the film soared past any expectations that I had for it from the start too, by being very well Directed and acted. ",2004
10,"This movie seems to be postcard perfect, a lesson straight out of the director's guide to romantic movies. Boy meets girl at a carnival, love from the other side of the tracks, a date by the water, etc. And yet the wonderful thing about this movie is that it takes what seems like a story you've heard already (at least in bits and pieces) and still moves you deeply. It really speaks about love in a way that most romantic movies miss by speaking in cliché or over shoot by adding in numerous complications to dramatize things. There have been other great movies to comment on love in recent years (Eternal Sunshine, Lost In Translation jump to mind) but this movie fills a need that those other movies miss: the need for a straight, sweep you off your feet romance. Too bad there can't be movies like this every year...",2005
10,"This amazing love story can be enjoyed by all. The Notebook is not one of those cheesy chick flicks that often come out, it is a brilliantly written intriguing story about two young lovers that most people can relate to.",2005
10,"I went into this movie with the misconception of thinking this was just another typical romantic movie, but I was very impressed by this film and the themes portrayed in this movie were handled in a great way.",2005
10,"This story plays out as Duke, played by James Garner, reads a story about two young people in the 1940s who fall in love and endure life. The movie moves between present-day and the 1940s. It is structurally very similar to ""Fried Green Tomatoes"", which is also one of my all time favorite movies.",2005
10,"The Notebook is one of my all-time favourite movies. Its a constant, and classic love story that makes you feel as if you are there watching it.. as if you are one of the characters, which makes the impact of the story just that much more real. There really are no words to describe how this movie makes you feel, but one thing is for sure... It will make you feel. After watching it, i've often just.. sat where i am and just thought about it. It's just one of those movies that you will think about 30 years after watching it, and still get that same feeling in your heart.. and you'll know that it touched you in one way or another. If you haven't seen it, you really are missing out... Its a classic!",2005
10,"I am a big fan of love stories. Lately, the film industry has been lacking the sort of element that I love to see in a movie. The last movie I saw that made me cry as much as ""The Notebook"" did was ""Ghost"" with Demi Moore. The casting of Allie and Noah in the movie was exceptional and made the feelings and emotions seem real. After watching the movie in the theater, I noticed every person, including the men, cry as they left the theater. Now when was the last time you saw anything like that?? I bought the movie on DVD the day it came out and have been watching it everday since that day!! I would highly recommend this movie to both males and females.",2005
1,"there are three things I look for in movies, quality acting, a good script, and originality of the story...this movie had none of these. Could it have been any more cliché? the only thing that impressed me was Allie's wardrobe and the car she was driving. I've seen better acting on lifetime! and so many unnecessary parts that are completely pointless. ""A walk to remember"" is about a hundred times better and it didn't get half the attention this movie did. If you're not aware already, it's based on a book by the same author as ""the notebook"". if you want to see a moving love story you'll be disappointed from this film unless you're 13...can't believe all the rave...it is not deserved...a total waste of my time...",2006
1,"Why this movie is rated so high is beyond me. Don't get me wrong: I'm a girl, love Ryan Gosling and was pretty much excited about watching the movie. Unfortunately, when this torture finally finished after two long and excruciating hours, I just couldn't help to think that this must've been the corniest piece of trash in the history of movie making. The lead actors in my opinion had zero chemistry, and Ryan Gosling really disappointed me as Noah. The diversity of facial expressions was basically nonexistent and the acting was bad. And what's up with the character of Noah? Was he supposed to act and sound like a psycho? Cause if he was, they did a hell of a job. Rachel McAdams was really pretty, and that's basically it. And the ending... Oh, the ending! It was so lame and unrealistic it made me gag. What's heartbreaking and sad about it is a mystery to me. I don't know, maybe I just can't see the grandness of The Notebook, but I certainly don't wish to come across it again.",2013
3,"SPOILERS THROUGHOUT. 'The Notebook' is the 17,329,587th movie about a woman choosing between a reliable steady guy who sincerely loves her and a macho jerk. It's also the 17,329,587th movie in which (big surprise!) she chooses the macho jerk, and we're supposed to applaud that decision. This movie's one slight twist in the moss-encrusted formula is a flashback framing device, which supposedly makes it more difficult for us in the present to guess which choice she made in the 1950s.",2004
1,"When they laid in the street to watch the lights change, I wanted an ice- cream truck to run them over. It's awful. Another poor-boy-meets rich-girl-and-her-parents-disapprove movie. If only Ryan Gosling's character had fallen from the carnival ride and she'd married the carny dude who had been responsible for the Texas Chainsaw Massacre in nearby Lot 7 of the Paramount Studios, then we might have had a movie worth watching. What we need is more of the main characters in trite movies to turn into cybermen with secret yearnings to marry daleks. And they need to eat green jelly beans - a definite sign of a moral deficiency in any character, anywhere.",2010

1,"It's the most cheesiest movie I have ever watched in my life. How, shallow a movie can get is well portrayed in the film ""NOTE BOOK."" If you'd like to watch a classic love story, with nothing new with no originality please choose this title. It was the worst experience ever. The characters were not very well chosen, and the storyline is too obvious. The script is poorly written. Not to mention that the writer of the book ""Note book"" is very conventional writer. I don't know how our society accepts a film with no creative spirit. I really think that this would be a great movie for maybe for relaxing time, but there is no need to really involve thinking as a matter of fact. It was a bad experience for me and I would never want to encounter such movies again, would like to stay away from romance genre, if people are calling this a romance movie.",2008
2,I think most of the folks who rated this movie between 1 and 3 stars have pretty much nailed the reasons why this film was bad-to-mediocre.,2005
1,"My wife and I watched The Notebook last night. Within ten minutes we were furious at how slow, cliché, and predictable it was. And then it just got worse and worse. It was so very very bad that we were actually drawn to watch in perverse, embarrassed horror as each scene plodded through stale, obvious dialog, and the actors tried to salvage what was obviously a terrible muddle by overacting. I can't begin to convey just how awful this movie is, in every sense. Leave aside the horrendously dull, cliché-ridden script, the terrible acting, the ham-fisted directing, the swelling tear-jerker music, and the incredibly obvious plot -- Even the freaking costumes were terrible. The fake facial hair looked like it was done by 3rd-graders. If movies are meant to fascinate, then this one did all right. I consider this the worst film I have seen in at least five years, but rarely if ever have I (and my wife) been compelled to stay all the way through such abysmal crap out of some sort of hilarious anger at how were were wasting our own time. I mean we were jumping on the couches ad screaming in warped glee as each predictable plot point was tediously checked off the director's checklist. All the way to the very last shot (in the backstory) of her coming back and them hugging in a swirl of stock sentimental string music -- OF COURSE SHE'S COMING BACK. And the front story? They, uh, die TOGETHER? My God. We could not stop howling. Was he even sick? No. He just died -- just because! Because it went with the sickeningly sweet music, I guess. Then I come here expecting to be vindicated and I find a bunch of comments by people who were actually taken in by this plodding, pathetic drivel. What in the world is up? I usually am with IMDb folks on their 7.8s, but man alive, folks, step away from the Kool-Aid.",2005
1,"...You may cry out due to complete boredom and instances of sudden outbursts of laughter due to this movie's all-round stupid and unrealistic plot. Just so sad to see two fabulous, classic actors accept supporting roles in a poorly written movie; with countless obvious mistakes, many being historical in nature; from a terrible book.",2007
8,"I must stress to you my belief in that the 'romantic comedy' is pretty much the worst creation of mankind. Some may argue that religion or the atom bomb are more destructive but the romcom (ugh!) is consistent proof that the public are idiots willing to fork over cash multiple times for the same old, same old crap. We very rarely get a sincere romance film, they kinda died out in the forties and have struggled for breath since.",2005
9,"I went to watch ""The Notebook"" because my girlfriend had read the book and asked me to come watch it with her. Being a guy who does not enjoy romantic movies very much I was very reluctant about seeing this film. However, I can honestly say that I was blown away by this beautifully written, acted, and directed movie. I had only seen Ryan Gosling in one other movie, ""Murder by Numbers"", and was impressed by his performance in an otherwise forgettable picture. He has a great charisma and on-stage presence that few other actors have. Similarly, Rachel McAdams truly shines here in her breakout role as a rich southern girl who falls in love with Gosling's character. Not to be outdone by their younger counter-parts, Gena Rowlands and James Garner are also excellent in this film.",2005
2,"I'm as much of a sucker for a good chick flick as any other woman, but this is just ridiculous! It's the cinematic equivalent of eating one of those big plastic bags of cotton candy all by yourself...it might sound good, but you'll feel kind of nauseated after.",2007
1,"You know that movie that everyone swoons over and you're like the only person who can't stand it and can't understand why so many like it? *sighs* Yeah, this is it.

And honestlyI don't get why so many people like this movie. I thought this was HORRIBLE!",2014
1,"Unfortunately I think this is one of those films that if you or I took it to the studio and said, 'can I make this great movie with my friends Mary, Mungo and Midge from school?' the studio would have you kicked to death on the spot.

4,"Every James Bond movie has its own set of rules. Just like every Indiana Jones movie has ITS own set of rules.

1,"Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) catches up with Danny Ocean and his team and demands that they repay the money that they stole from him (in Oceans 11) plus interest. He holds back from violent action however as he is under the instruction of the world's greatest thief, the Night Fox. The team then have to pull off a series of heists to pay Benedict back whilst testing their abilities against the Night Fox who wishes to maintain his position as the greatest thief ever. Put simply, this film is a complete mess. The masses may argue that it is ""cool"" and that Clooney and Pitt put in great performances but these are the same people who have a subscription to ""Hello"" magazine and think that David Beckham has the potential to be a great actor. The story is convoluted, it is not complex or clever and it does not have intelligent twists and turns, it is just a complete mess that spills out in multiple directions with the hope that the audience will think it is cool and intelligent (Hello magazine readers). Any respectable movie watcher will however see the film for the farce that it is. Whilst Oceans 11 wasn't a great film it had a decent pace, was stylish and had some decent twists and turns. This movie loses its way very quickly and then basically gives up. It is as if the director and cast said to themselves, hey this isn't really working out, lets just have a laugh! Indeed the cast looks like they are enjoying themselves but I was not. I will not delve into the plot as its confused evolution does not warrant any examination. The addition of Catherine Zeta Jones is largely annoying. The scenes where Julia Roberts impersonates herself (with Bruce Willis undertaking a cameo role) whilst mildly amusing appear to be a desperate move to keep the audience interested. The movie is so full of plot holes that it as if Arnie has emptied an Uzi 9mm into the film studio. Credit can only be given to some scenes where the Night Fox uses Caopeira to undertake a heist against the back drop of some funky music but this is hardly justification to watch the movie. The final scene features the team in a nonsensical drunken stupor; this accurately sums up the movie. Stick with the original.",2005

Thus Ocean and his crew must scramble together what they owe; too hot to work in America, they set their sights on Amsterdam.... where, not so coincidently, Rusty Ryan (Pitt) has an ex-love (Zeta-Jones) who just so happens to be head of police and hot on their trail. But Benedict and sexy cop Isabel Lahiri (Zeta-Jones) aren't the crew's only problem.

1,"I had read the newspaper reviews of this film and I must say my expectations were very low before watching Ocean's 12. I really enjoyed the first movie but this successor is one of the worst movies ever. I would rate it top 5 of the worst movie I have ever seen. Why do I say that? First of all there is a story so thin that Britney Spears Crossroads looks like the perfect action thriller. The fragments that could be assigned the term ""story"" is loosely held together at times but most of the time the movie just moves along with no purpose or drive. The entire story seems forced and the script surrounding the story is even more forced that it become farce at times.",2005
1,I felt compelled to write about this movie after i joined IMDb because i thought it was the worst script writing i have seen in a while.,2005
5,"Simply put, this is a boring movie. The strength of Ocean's 11 was that it started at point A and it ended at point B, and it did so in a convincing and entertaining matter and threw in a believable plot twist at the end. It was very simply and straightforward.",2004
1,"I had very high hopes walking into this movie. After all, Ocean's 11 was a truly great Hollywood product. Its rapid-fire jokes, incredible star power and tight script made it one of the most fun caper films I have ever seen. Of course, with all the money it made, a sequel was on the way, and I, for one, was excited.",2004
10,"I loved Ocean's Eleven so I was hesitant to watch the sequel but this didn't fall flat the way so many sequels do. It is strange in that it builds off the original, you would be lost without previous knowledge of Ocean's Eleven, but yet it has an entirely new tone and feeling as well as European look rather than the Vegas glitz of the first movie. I was very happy that all of the originals came back for the sequel. If you like a good action movie that keeps you guessing then this movie is for you. It was very nice to see Brad Pitt's character fleshed out more in this movie. I would like to have seen more of the banter between the Malloy brother characters but on the whole the movie left me wondering if there will be an Ocean's 13. There seemed to be an opening for one with where they left the Night Fox at the end of Ocean's Twelve.",2005

6,"It's inevitable, isn't it? After the success of the remake of Ocean's Eleven, out comes the sequel three years later. I liked the style of the teaser trailer (and was probably one of the only ones who didn't mind the name), so naturally, I was looking forward to the movie. Naturally, it's a sequel, so it's inferior to the original (which I liked more than the original of the original). The entire cast is back (plus one more, obviously) for the necessary foreign-country locations and trendy scene transitions. There's the constant music, the people with the general European accents (well, villains), and every other caper movie cliché in the books.",2004
1,Man I loved Ocean's 11.,2004
10,"Now, the trick with a sequel to a remake of a lesser movie is this: how to repeat the magic without making it a bland retread of what's been seen before? Well. It's a truth universally acknowledged that when a film revolves around a heist that goes smoothly even when the victim may eventually retaliate, the only thing its sequel do is go the opposite direction: build momentum around another heist that will redeem our pack of thieves from their state of disgrace and send the story off some odd directions with characters who have their own ulterior motives. If you look closely you can actually feel the noose slowly start tightening itself around Danny Ocean's group. Eccentrics pop in and out, never to be seen again, leaving their own mark -- this is a light ballet gliding towards the moment when everything converges, gets messed up... and to say more would be criminal. You have to experience it on your own. See how one of the most ballsy in-jokes involving a certain Oscar-winning actress from one of Soderbergh's earlier films obliquely leads to the denouement where not one, but two double-climaxes -- one frankly hilarious, fraught with its own little family dysfunction, the other sweetly emotional -- virtually sweep the rug off of you. If that isn't entertainment, I don't know what is.",2007
1,"Ocean's 12 starts off on annoying and gets worse from there on. Like a celebrity awards presentation, each major actor/actress is introduced in short 60-second scenarios that seem to stop just short having a blinking ""applaud now"" sign. The first 60 minutes of the film are incredibly disjointed, poorly edited, and at times, utterly unrelated to the story and confusing. Speaking of the story,...there is one, kinda,...but its barely visible for all the ""look at me"" shots and cameos. Only Matt Damon seemed to actually ""act"" during this film...the rest of the cast appeared to only be there to participate in a rat-pack-wanna-be session. As for the heist, the action, the drama....it was put into the last 8-10 minutes of the movie and was pathetic and anticlimactic. Horrible! Horrible! Horrible!",2004
1,"I can honestly say, which doesn't happen often, that I would have preferred to have just not seen this movie all together. I feel like the actors in this movie got together, realized they could do whatever they wanted and people would still come see it, and made a travesty of the first movie.",2004
6,"The 2001 remake of Lewis Milestone's ""Ocean's Eleven"" is a good adventure, with action, comedy and thriller in an updated screenplay. When this sequel was released, I was impressed with the number of stars and locations mostly in Europe, and certainly a huge budget. Unfortunately, this movie does not have the most relevant component: a decent screenplay. The beginning is confused and most of the situations and dialogs are not funny, being indeed ridiculous; when the execution of the heist is disclosed in the end, it is ludicrous; and the absurd plot itself is totally unbelievable and does not work. The direction is also very bad, with horrible and weird movements of camera. Steven Soderbergh began his career with exceptional works, but his last films are very deceptive (""Full Frontal""(2002); ""Solaris""(2002)). My vote is six.",2006
1,"The sequel to Ocean's Eleven is dreadful. Let's look at the first one, it was funny, interesting, and had some unique characters. In this one, the magic of the first one is stripped away. It's unfunny, it's uninteresting, and you don't even see most of the characters for more than a minute. It begins with Terry Benedict(Garcia), the villain from the first one, going around acting cool while letting the Ocean's Eleven know that they had two weeks in which to return his money with interest or he would have them killed. The team then goes to Amsterdam to try to get rich. They are then confronted by a good thief who calls himself the Nightfox(Cassel), who thinks he's better than the eleven and challenges them to a thief duel. First off, what a crappy plot, it is also dreadfully predictable. While watching, you don't connect with any of the characters and any so called ""fun"" that you are supposed to have is ruined by terrible camera work, annoying music, and annoying transitions. If that's not enough to make you reconsider and see a good film like Finding Neverland, then you'll be in for a treat. Perhaps the worst thing about this disaster is that in the middle of the film, in a failed attempt to have some laughs, Julia Roberts has to play Julia Roberts in a heist operation. And if that's not bad enough, they also hide a pillow underneath her shirt to try to make her look pregnant and have Bruce Willis in a cameo playing himself meet up with her and that add to the chaos. Any way you look at this it's a terrible film. 1 out of 10.",2004

George Clooney and his Croonies stole the money, the girl, and the audience in their hilarious escapade in Las Vegas.

9,"Rarely 	known a movie I've been looking forward to so much than Q.T's resumption of the Kill Bill saga. I, as well as millions of others film-freaks, awaited Uma Thurman's further adventures with wicked anticipation. And of courseTarantino didn't disappoint. Volume two is a completely different movie than volume one, but it's equally brilliant and the director's trademarks are shown more than obviously. Volume one merely was homage to the Eastern Martial Arts movies, with delightfully over-the-top splatter and gore while Vol. 2 fully focuses on ancient westerns and rural horror. There's more dialogue, more twists n turns and the anti-chronological structure results in more depth and involvement. Some unexplained elements from Vol.1 become clear now and even the entire background of Thurman's character gets unveiled. For the very first time, (as far as I can remember) Tarantino really knows how to create an unbearable tension! There's a sequence in which Uma is buried alive and trapped under the groundThrough simple methods, like a completely black screen, Tarantino arises claustrophobia among the audience! Truly terrific filmmaking. ",2004
10,"Over the last 40 years, I've seen a lot of movies. All types. Some great, some good and some mostly inedible; most left my breath with a sour smell. Westerns, sci-fi, comedies, dramas, etc. After seeing Kill Bill Vol I, I assumed that any sequel would pale to its predecessor. I, of course, was premature in my prediction. The movie was, by all means, a classic. I feel Taratino was really trying to make a great movie versus making money for his producers. To build his tasty sandwich, he took the lessons he learned from life as a movie maker and cleverly managed to meld some slices of meat from Sergio Leone (subtly), Akira Kurosawa (very subtly) and, I'm stretching it here, Ridley Scott, to create a great sequel to an excellent first movie. He used some great, almost forgotten actors (Daryl Hannah, Micheal Parks, and David Carradine to create a memorable meal. It was only a sandwich, but what morsel it was. I was full and wanting more. Very rare to find this type of film in our corporate world. He must wield some real power in the movie world. I don't know of anyone who has saw this movie who hasn't given it great feedback. And I know all types of viewers. My wife, who really doesn't like anything that is not overly melancholy or dripping with sentimentality, actually liked the whole movie. That in itself is an endorsement. Well done. Mr. Tarantino, you will be hard placed to match this gem.",2006
6,The movie wasn't bad and i am not saying you should avoid it. But after a thrilling and great first movie i was expecting this to be just as good but even though Tarantino did a good job and some impressive acting by Uma Thurman. What the film lacks is the poor storyline. If you've seen the first film you will realise the lack of fights which was shocking enough.,2008
3,"This really is a poor film in my opinion. I really can't understand all the hype. The fighting is poor, and doesn't know what it wants to be. Half-kung-fu, half-comedy, and competent in neither. If you want a decent kung-fu fight, watch a kung-fu film, not this commercialised rubbish.",2004

10,"Kill Bill Volume 2 is the astonishing follow-up to perhaps 2003's best film, Kill Bill Volume 1. Quentin Tarantino once again demonstrates a mastery of dialogue in this homage to the great western and kung fu movies that inspired him from his video clerk days.",2004
1,"I opted to see ""LadyKillers"" instead of this movie recently. But after a few people said it was so great, I decided to give it a chance.  Wrong move!!! There were a few nice action sequences but it was like watching paint dry waiting for them.  I'll go ahead and mention spoiler alert now since my comments may spoil it for those who enjoy this type of movie.  I nodded off a few times so they might have answered the only question I had which was how Bill got the daughter from the pregnant mother he tried to kill.  By the time they showed the daughter, I really didn't care.  At least 30 minutes of useless dialog should have been removed.   It even took an eternity for Bill to die.  And why was Uma crying after striking the fatal blow???  It was about as dumb as her going after everyone with that sword even though she was an expert marksman with a gun.  Although LadyKillers wasn't as funny as I had hoped, it was the better movie of the two.  My recommendation is that you skip both of these and read a good book if you want some real entertainment.",2004
1,"So the second half of Tarantino's epic Kill Bill promised to be the pick me up the first required to stand up and be validated.  It failed miserably in that attempt.  Beware, there may be some spoilers.",2004
1,"I couldn't watch it to the end. Well, I kind of knew what was going to happen anyway. Quentin Tarantino was going to meander around, alternating pointless violence with hip dialogue until Uma Thurman's character finally got her revenge. Or not. To be honest I really didn't care if Beatrix set up home with Bill and they baked cookies together forever instead of her killing him.",2007
10,"Although, as a film buff myself, having a whole Kill Bill epic in one sitting would've been satisfying, like the first part that was split Vol. 2 works extraordinarily well. In terms of storytelling it's direct and (of course) unconventional, in style Tarantino pays homage/borrows (or depending on your point of view steals) from most of the films that stew around in his arsenal. And with dialog, in maybe a couple of moments it doesn't seem up to par, but it's not often. And the acting is in the greatest tradition of B-movie, spaghetti western, shaw-brothers, kung-fu et. all. If you look at both Kill Bills it's fascinating as a movie buff to discover things you haven't seen before (i.e. the whole blood-coated style of the climax in vol. 1) and things you recognize right away (i.e. the unmistakable songs of Ennio Morricone, who is just as creditable as Leone for Tarantino's style).",2004
1,Lamest sequel ever!,2005
10,"Kill Bill vol.1 and vol.2 are definitely the best movies(duology) in cinema history. It contains a lot of emotion, agony, thrill, melancholy and feeling of justice and vengeance. It is definitely the best fighting movie ever. Ennio Morricone soundtracks were perfect. I admire Robert Rodriguez and RZA a lot. Itis the first time Tarantino uses Morricone music, children to play in the movie,katana swords. I loved the idea of using sword. It is actually a film with a lot of martial arts, chapters, revenge, violence & love and it has no sex scenes which is very important for the movie. The Bride is not a woman for sex. She is a warrior who wants to take her daughter back.The end scene creates a feeling of justice.Definitely, best movie.",2017
7,"Quentin Tarantino has got talent, but he whipped up so much frenzy with ""Kill Bill, Volume 1"" that there was no way that he live up to what he had started in ""Kill Bill, Volume 2."" ""Kill Bill, Vol. 1"" has more artistic merit that the second half. For instance, Tarantino never showed Bill in a full shot in the first half. Obviously, the ""Pulp Fiction"" director was treating his chief villain like the early Blofeld in the James Bond thrillers that didn't show the villain until ""You Only Live Twice."" In the first half of ""Kill Bill,"" our heroine--Beatrix Kiddo (Uma Thurman)survives an attempt on her life. We know that the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad turns out for her wedding rehearsal and mowed down everybody in a barrage of gunfire. However, this singular event was never shown. The discretion that Tarantino exercised in ""Bill 1"" distinguishes it from the lack of discretion that he depicted in the follow-up. Indeed, he doesn't show this homicidal quartet actually perforating everybody in the chapel. Nevertheless, aside from showing the scene as a necessity, this is basically the only thing that he does that doesn't follow the chronology.",2012
5,"Quentin Tarrantino tells us in the documentary which is part of the special features section of the Kill Bill Volume 2 DVD, that Volume 2 is much more an homage to spaghetti westerns than to the martial arts homage of Volume 1. Volume 2 brings us back to the beginning of Volume 1, The Massacre at Two Pines. It's a slow-moving scene where we finally get to meet Bill who ultimately rejects The Bride's deep-seated wish to leave her murderous past behind. Quite fortunately Tarrantino opts not to mimic Peckinpah westerns and show us close-ups of the massacre in slow motion. In fact none of the massacre is shown and by doing so he wisely avoids alienating his audience. Kill Bill Volume 2 ends up being more camp than horror show. Had Tarrantino decided to show the massacre of innocents it wouldn't have worked in his film precisely because the victims (aside from the 'real' people at the wedding rehearsal) are comic book villains who we are not supposed to identify with.",2009
9,`Revenge is a dish best served cold.',2004
6,"Volume 2 does indeed tie up the loose ends of Volume 1, but it does so in a rather abrupt and ultimately unsatisfying way. Unlike Part 1, which was mostly guts, gore, and flash, Volume 2 is rather crisp, sticking to the plot in a straightforward manner without going off on tangents. The film sticks to the protagonist, Black Mamba's, quest for vengeance without going into side stories about the antagonists' pasts, nor engaging in 40-minute swordfights with hundreds of henchmen. This is no action movie; really, the murders of the remaining assassins are, compared to Black Mamba's epic sword duel with Cottonmouth in Volume 1, incredibly quick (including *SPOILER ALERT* Bill's, the main antagonist of Volume 2). Black Mamba does not even kill off Sidewinder, a trailer- trash strip joint bouncer who also happens to be Bill's brother! I was hoping Black Mamba would engage in epic sword fights with Mountain Snake (Daryll Hannah of ""Splash!"" fame) and Bill (the late David Carradine, Grasshopper of ""Kung-Fu""). Mountain Snake suffers the fate of the criminal who taunted Jesus at Calvary, also graphically depicted in a film that came out the same year as Volume 2, ""Passion of the Christ."" ",2009

10,"Writer-director Brad Bird here has something that I was caught off-guard by just a bit. I always expect Pixar films to be above-par, family entertainment, the kinds of films that can have an appeal to adults on a satirical, jab-in-the-side effect by having the characters reacting to each other as they would on a film with a higher rating, whilst giving the bright colors, action, and silliness that appeals to kids. Watching The Incredibles, their sixth feature-length offering, I wasn't so entertained and amused since their 98 film A Bug's Life, and it almost brought me back to the emotional impact I felt when in the theater for the first time getting Toy Story into my system. ",2004
10,"I hope that this movie does really well because this has to be one of the best animated movies I have ever seen.

10,"I finally saw Pixar/Disney's ""The Incredibles"" after several scheduling glitches. Writer and Director Brad Bird's ""The Incredibles"" is truly incredible. It is one of the best movies of the year. The CGI animation is both cutting edge and simply stunning, and like all Pixar projects it has a solid story as it's foundation. Bird uses the Superhero mythology to tell a funny and poignant story: that when we forfeit or withhold our greatness, we are not being true to ourselves, and more importantly it is a disservice to those around us. As the story begins, Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) was the superhero's Superhero. As voiced by Nelson, Mr. Incredible, is very confident, on the verge of cocky. He uses his super strength and powers for good. He marries super, Elasticgirl (Holly Hunter). However, Mr. Incredible soon falls victim like his fellow ""Supers"" to the plight of our litigious society-- the people they save are suing them. Instead of getting malpractice insurance (which would have been a different movie), the persecuted... and prosecuted Supers assume their secret identities in a covert government relocation program. They also promise never to use their powers again even for good.",2004
9,"I am tired of reading reviews about how an animated film is too violent for children, deals with mature issues like segregation or death, or is simply ""too grown up"" for small children. Since when did we decide to water down the truth for children, and when exactly are they old enough for certain issues, and why is it animation means it's suppose to be for children. Animation has allowed movie makers to break molds, has allowed them to do things that could not be done with regular actors or locations. We use CGI to accomplish effects we otherwise couldn't do, why is the art of illustration not considered on the same level as the art of computer graphics? I don't feel that just because something is made for children it should be dumbed down and I don't believe that an adult is too superior to watching something that is animated. Stories geared toward children such as Aesop's Fables or the fairy tales of the brothers Grimm, and Hans Christian Anderson, were told to teach life lessons; don't cry wolf, be happy with what you have and don't trust strangers. These are lessons, and stories, that were not watered down, that showed to what evil depths greed, slothfulness and envy, just to name a few, could take hold of in a person.",2004
8,"This was somewhat of a surprise hit when it came out in 2004. Most of the attention was on a competing animated film but this is the one that turned out to be a huge box-office success. Word of mouth helped his immensely. It's what made me check it out, as several friends recommended it. I wound up agreeing with them: it's excellent entertainment.",2008
10,"Wow. This isn't just the best animated movie I've seen in a long time; it's one of the best movies, period. For sheer giddy enjoyment, stunning visuals, engaging characters. When the industry makes films with this much action and special-effects wizardry and a couple of big-name faces up front, they generally don't spend money on niceties like writing and character development. But Pixar, since they have something to prove with their computer-generated actors, has done the hard and loving work to infuse these cartoon characters with a humanity that most big-budget live-action movies don't match. Go see this one. Go see it for:",2004
9,"Pixar has again proved that it's ethics and capabilities are inexterminable even for the tough-willed Dreamworks, which are gradually attempting to catch up on with standards. But with Pixar's new title, we once more experience a great gratifying animation which deeps you inside by it's humorous and enthralling plot and keeps you laughing out loudly until the very end. Dreamworks' titles compared to Pixars are not too peculiar, but they seem to rip all their titles from Pixar and create a fake illusion of originality. Now that Pixar has created another chef-d'oeuvre, no doubt Dreamworks will once more rip the idea and create a title relating to superheroes. 9.5/10",2004
10,"This website has ranked this film to be one of the top 250 films ever made...You want to know something, I totally agree with this verdict!! This high definition surreal film by the master of animation...Walt Disney, evoked a successful culmination of cinematic brilliance on a myriad of artistic production levels!! An accomplishment like this epitomizes the term ""entertaining"" in it's most resounding form!! In evaluating the initial premise of this film, it compounds the dilemma of the proverbial glory days being a thing of the past!! A guy who was a football hero in his school days whereby it was routine to score four touchdowns in a game, and eventually, it fades due to a knee injury or being out of shape or something, this signifies that his best days are over!! When a former head cheerleader who was the starlight of every male's eye, who counted on her good looks, and she loses them, her best days are over as well!! So too is the case of a family of superheroes who leaped through buildings at a single bound in a vigilante crusade to capture nefarious criminals!! Ultimately, their vicarious damage to buildings and citizens meant that the municipality had to insulate itself from any further pecuniary culpability, and relocate them!! This would seemingly suggest that the Incredible's best days are behind them also!! As is the case with so many has beens, the end result winds up being a case of the breadwinner getting relegated to the monotonous plight of an inane job such as an insurance salesman. Such mediocrity reduces the Mr and Mrs to the state of being sedentary and overly mortgaged!! This movie depicts how even a family of manufactured stick people representing the world of fantasy, cannot hide from the afflictions of mid-life crises!!!! The ultimate undoing in these superhero's lives are the non-visceral elements of banality such as; indemnity forms, traffic jams and paranoid nightmares about deteriorating marital trust!! Just as someone wants to be a star football player,or a head cheerleader, all over again, these Incredibles wish to return to their exciting lives as the superheroes who took on capital crime!! Such a plot is very innovative, the writing in this dressed up doggerel of entertainment was remarkable!! This movie has a succinctly homogeneous blend of voices which induce an appropriately heinous cacophony of emotions which effectively illustrate exuberance and despair!! The sound effects were outstanding in this movie!! The cinematography in ""The Incredibles"" was superb!! Middle class hang-ups have been injected into teenage movies and television ever since ""The Simpsons"". This trademark of domestic rancor is for purposes of appealing to a broader audience range!! I found this film to be an ingenious use of satire, while mastering a digitalized analog of intelligent caricatures!! ""The Incredibles"" is not just a kid's film, or an overgrown adolescent's film, it is for everybody!! The family was called the Incredibles, the movie is called FANTASTIC!!",2007

Ever since the first Toy Story was released in 1995, I have eagerly awaited the release of each new movie. When The Incredibles was released in 2004, I could not get to the theater soon enough, and needless to say, I was not disappointed.

9,"If you want to experience the – real – old west first hand, look no further; you'll find it in 'Deadwood'. There has never been a show or a film that came as close to showing what life must have been like in those lawless young towns that got built nearly over night wherever gold was found. A magnet for all kind of fortune seekers (gold diggers, whores, outlaws – but also settlers who were just hoping to build a better life), the town of Deadwood was notorious even by the standards of the time. In the show, this ""cesspool of vice"" is brought back to life with great attention to historical detail. You'll find no romanticised view of pioneers who lived and died by ""the code of honour"", but real people whose moral standards are – in most cases – murky at best. And the world they inhabit is a rough, dirty, violent place where only the fiercest – and the most cunning – survive. ",2014
10,"Absolutely superb. I don't think I've ever given anything a 10/10 before, but for a TV show, Deadwood is excellent - and given the crap we're generally subjected to on the box, absolutely outstanding. The sets, the research, the directing, the characters, the acting - all shine. And without wanting to sound gushy, the script is close to Shakespearian in its prosaic yet pragmatic tone. The juxtaposition of the grit and dirt and blood of the real 'Wild West' with formal Victorian language is genius. Even the opening credits are beautiful. It may not be everyone's cup of tea (the language and content can be a little 'strong' although entirely appropriate and in context) but anyone who's a fan of quality entertainment, shouldn't go past it.",2007
10,"I write this beholden to no cock-sucker when I say that Deadwood is, quite simply, the best TV series of all-time. This show raised is light-years ahead of most of even the so-called great TV series around, for example, the Sopranos. HBO are a disgrace for canceling this show. The dialog , characterization, acting, plot, costumes - everything - is first rate. This is a TV drama which really makes you think. You can actually learn what makes people tick watching this show. Even though its set in a gold mining town, Deadwood, in the 1880s it's themes are still relevant to modern day life : people are still trying to cheat, kill, control, alter their state of consciousness, and get rich. Has that much really changed?",2008
10,"Don't get me wrong, there have been great westerns to come before Deadwood, but none of them really got it right. There is just a reality that some people aren't willing to deal that after 50 years of our history being whitewashed through film and TV, we're finally starting to see the truth. David Milch has done his research and discovered the wonderfully bizarre contradiction of languages used in the old west. Watching the cast of Deadwood converse with a combination of old world English laced with profanity straight from the gutter is incredible and feels right for the first time. Where do people think our language came from? People always want to think that they were the first to do something, when things like profanity, substance abuse and prostitution have been around since before man walked erect.",2004

10,"This stands out for me as one of the best series I have ever seen hit the small screen. The attention to detail,story and character is second to none. Deadwood is brought to life by the good, the bad and the very ugly- with some of the most wonderfully theatrically profane, but ultra-realistic dialogue of any western. True, you could question some of the dialogue for exactly how accurate it is to the time it is set- but it sounds absolutely convincing in the world they have managed to build. Lets face it- not too many Westerns even bothered all that much in the first place! The 3 series have impeccable standards of production, weaving some of the real historical events of the time into a fictional Old West testament. The degradation, ill manners, costumes, dirt, mud and profanities are all present and accounted for.",2006
10,"I've been a fan of HBO since I saw Band of Brothers on Dutch television. Unfortunately, the Dutch television companies don't know anything about good programming. Most television series are cut short during the season so that the second part of the season can be shown the next year. Sometimes when they stop mid season, the rest of the episodes aren't shown at all and they start all over again. This is one of the reasons that I don't watch series on Dutch television. I usually rent or borrow the DVD's. Although we get to see most popular HBO series (Carnivàle, Sopranos, Six Feet Under) I never watch them on television. Although I'd never seen the show, I decided to buy the DVD after reading some reviews. Thank God I did!",2006

I have a brother who worked in mining camps in Canada in the 1970's. When one camp was being struck they found three bodies of guys that had never been missed! He reckons Deadwood is right on the mark. The quality of script and acting is top-shelf.

If you can, try to get your hands on the Season I DVD set with the special features disc. I was surprised to learn that many of the main and supporting characters beyond Wild Bill and Calamity were in fact also based on real life people. Al Swearengen ran an operation that took in between four and six thousand dollars a night, while other notables with a true history include Doc Cochran and the Reverend Henry Smith. Though the story playing out in the series is often a product of creator David Milch's 'imaginative reality', that in no way lessens it's impact as a narrative of the Dakotas and it's overly rich history of villainy, debauchery and profanity.",2006

8,"Loosely based on Homer's 'Iliad', Wolfgang Petersen directs this epic war film, with an ensemble cast including Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom, Diane Kruger, Sean Bean, Brian Cox, Rose Byrne, Garrett Hedlund, Peter O' Toole, Brendan Gleeson, & Tyler Mane. Set in 1193 B.C., this movie tells the story of a war between the two cities of Troy and Sparta, and the story of one of the bravest warriors to roam ancient Greece named Achilles. Brad Pitt delivers one of the best performances of his career as Achilles, giving the right amount of power and strength. Eric Bana is also terrific as Prince Hector, trying to negotiate peace between Troy and Sparta. Besides the supporting cast, Peter O' Toole is just perfect playing the king of Troy. The only disappointing character in this movie is Orlando Bloom as Hector's prince brother, who seems to overreact in every scene he is in, as if trying to end the project early, and walk away with his paycheck. Although the movie contains a running time of 162 minutes, director Wolfgang Petersen perfectly makes the audience forget about those 162 minutes, because they'll be distracted by all the incredible action. This movie contains some of the most elaborate action sequences that I've ever seen on film. The costumes and the art direction all stay true to the ancient Greece setting, and they all create a realistic feel to the movie. This movie is perfectly well-made, from the distinguished art, to the intense battle sequences. Yes, the movie is somewhat inaccurate to Homer's Iliad, but at least this movie is flat out entertaining. I haven't seen that much gladiator movies in my time, but I can safely say that ""Troy"" is one of the most remarkable and action-packed motion pictures that audiences will never forget. ""Troy"", in my review, ""action-packed, beautifully well-made"".",2012
5,"Now I'm fully aware that most film adaptations cannot relay all the themes and as a result, never truly live up to the book. However this one is something else!!! Best I can describe Troy is that it's a bastardised version of the Iliad. It's puzzling why they even tried to squeeze the epic into a feature length film in the first place. Hopefully we'll see the Iliad made into a great series one day, as all films and mini-series thus far have been major disappointments.",2008
9,"But it's an inspiring tale of men(!) at war in ancient times.  The movie, albeit long, moves along a good pace, with mercifully brief romantic and philosophical breaks between the combat scenes.  This movie is action, with more than a little thought put into accurately presenting the realities of the tactics used in Greek warfare.  Troy is also to be congratulated for not over-armoring the cast like previous Hollywood productions and staying true to the lightness of armor prevalent during the historical period.",2004

7,"This is a review of the film Troy, which was released in 2004. It is directed by Wolfgang Petterson and written by David Benioff, and based on the Iliad by Homer. King Agamemnon (Brian Cox) is ruler of Mycenea, but wishes to rule an empire, so his army slowly conquers the rest of what is now Greece. The only threat to his empire is a neighbouring country called Troy. Agamemnon's brother Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson) is tired of war, so he negotiate's peace with the Trojan princes Hector (Eric Bana) and Paris (Orlando Bloom). Upon leaving, Paris reveals to Hector that he has taken Menelaus's wife, Helen (Diane Kruger) with him, as he loves her. Menelaus goes to Agamemnom to start a war, and Agamemnom manages to convince legendary warrior Achilles (Brad Pitt) to fight among the Greek army. Hector and Paris arrive in Troy, and tell their father Priam (Peter O'Toole) of the upcoming war. Agamemnom arrives on the beaches of Troy with 1,000 ships, but after day 1, Achilles refuses to fight, and instead cares to Trojan prisoner Briseis (Rose Byrne). Over the next two battles Hector kills Menelaus, Ajax (who is the Greek's best warrior after Achilles), and Achilles's cousin, Patroclus, and finally Achilles decides to don his armour and face Hector in a duel to the death. Achilles wins and kills Hector but makes a pact with Priam to allow the Trojans 12 days of peace. After 12 days, Priam and his men ride out to find the Trojan horse, and all the Greeks gone. Priam orders the horse to be brought into the city of Troy. That night, Odysseus (Sean Bean) and his men escape form the horse, and open the gates and allow Agamemnon and all of his thousands of men in. Achilles also escapes from the horse, and goes to find Briseis. in the confusion, Priam is killed by Agamemnon, who is in turn killed by Briseis, and as Achilles escapes for a new life with her, Paris shoots him through the ankle and he dies. While all three of leads have both good points and flaws, it is Peter O'Toole and Julie Christie in small supporting roles that, as per usual, put in the best performances. Brian Cox seems to ham it up to much, but Brendan Gleeson and Sean Bean do well enough with the bland characters they are given. The fight scenes are great, although some of the close combat tactics used by Achilles are all but impossible. The more rough style used by Hector of Ajax feels more realistic, but the duel between Hector and Achilles is the best scene of the film.",2012
7,"Troy could have been a great epic film... if wouldn't have been for some really disrespectful and unnecessary alterations that they did to the immortal story, the great Iliad written by Homer, and considered a masterpiece of literature through thousands and thousands of years... but this guys here just modified it like if all this wouldn't matter...",2005
2,"I like Brad Pitt enormously. He is an actor with brains and wit, not to mention face, pectorals and all the rest. Since I saw him in ""Thelma and Louise"" a thought has been bothering me, who does he remind me of? ""Troy"" did it for me. He is the new Brigitte Bardot. The differences are obvious of course. Male, American etc but Brigitte Bardot comes to mind nonetheless. He is so beautiful that he is at his most effective when he plays against it. ""Kalifornia"" ""12 Monkeys"" ""Fight Club"" ""Snatch"" His self deprecating humor makes him human, almost accessible. Fortunately ""Troy"" will soon be forgotten. Only still photographs with Pitt, semi naked in ravishing sprint positions will decorate the walls of legions of salivating fans. Strange, ""Das Boot"" is one of the great films of the second part of the 20th Century. What is Wolfgang Petersen doing directing this? Well, I suppose it would be very hard to say no at the chance of working with the new Brigitte Bardot.",2005
2,"To confess having fantasies about Brad Pitt is a pretty tough admission for an heterosexual to make. But what can I tell you? Maybe is that famous extra something that everybody talks about and makes a star a star. It crosses that barrier. It pulls you into unknown sensual and emotional territory. Brando had it in spades, Montgomery Clift, Gary Cooper, James Dean of course and in more recent times, Tom Cruise, Jude Law, Johnny Depp, Ewan McGregor and Billy Crudup. Women fell in love with Garbo, Dietrich, Katharine and Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly, Marilyn Monroe, Julie Christie, Charlotte Rampling, Meryl Streep, Vanessa Redgrave, Julia Roberts and very very recently Natalie Portman. But Brad Pitt has, singlehandedly, redefined the concept. He is the only reason to go out, get in the car, find parking, buy a ticket, popcorn and get into a theatre to see ""Troy"" If you liked epics in the ""Jupiter's Darling"" style you may enjoy this. But if you don't, go all the same, we want to keep Brad Pitt in business.",2005
1,"In the overall scheme of making movies based upon classical literature, this is one of the worst attempts I've seen in my 63 years. The screenwriter and director, and ultimately the producers, took ""The Iliad"" and tossed it into the movie blender that is Big Money. Then they pressed the ""liquify"" button. It amazes me that the director of this movie directed ""Das Boot"". So, I supposed some hard examples are in order, so here's a few: (1) ""The Iliad"" has nothing whatsoever to do with the Trojan Horse; (2)Achilleus, probably one of the most complex characters in all literature, is not a hybrid between Conan The Barbarian, a Zen Buddhist and the father, on ""Married w/Children; (3)The ""Atriadae"", Meneleus and Agamemnon, had an entirely different fate than that in the movie, and without those fates, the entire sense of the story has vanished; (4)With the possible exception of O'Toole's Priam, all the characters essences were stood on their heads, and (5)The Theme(s) of the epic was utterly lost. This movie was awful. Just awful.",2005
2,"Hello there,",2004
6,"For a movie loosely based on a poem written thousands of years ago, the director and screenwriter have done an excellent job in re-creating the epic story and the ancient world on the screen, which was probably quite a difficult task. The production is fantastic, visual effects are great, and yet my opinion on Troy is divided in two: The movie is built in such a way that we, the viewers, aren't entirely sure who are the bad guys. Brad Pitt's Achilles is displayed as the star, the hero, and yet he fights for the Greeks, who are displayed as brutal warriors under the rule of a greedy tyrant, Agamemnon. In fact, the entire Trojan War was started only because of the greed of the king of Sparta, Menelaus. Paris, the prince of Troy (son of Priam, the king) took Helen, Menelaus' wife, back to Troy with him after a peace meeting in Sparta. This enraged Menelaus and so Agamemnon, his brother, rounded up the entire Greek army to attack Troy and retrieve his wife. On the other hand, the Trojans are sort of shown as the ""good guys"". Just because of one mistake that Paris made, the Trojans now have to hold back an attack of 50,000 Greeks, while loosing thousands of husbands, sons and cousins in the process. Hector is displayed as a family man: He doesn't want to go to war, he'd rather stay home with his wife and newborn child, but he is loyal to Troy and must fight for her. This is slightly different than the way the Trojan War had always been conveyed to me: Helen did not run off with Paris, but Paris seduced her and practically kidnapped her with him back to Troy. Hector was a big, brutal warrior who had absolutely no problem with killing as many people as he possibly could. I really liked the way the movie showed the Trojans as the good guys and the Greeks as the evil, greedy tyrants. It's definitely a fresh and original approach to the story.",2005
1,"My disclaimer for this is that I am a graduate student of Literature; but I like a good action movie as much as anyone else. I was totally excited about this movie: great cast, great director, a timeless epic story; all the right components right? WRONG! Certain tales are *timeless* and should not be changed too much. I was all right with the screenwriters taking out the role of the gods in this story, I was moderately all right with them cutting out the women in this tale (overplaying Helen who never speaks in the Illiad, and cutting out Hecuba--Priam's wife and Queen of Troy--completely, cutting out Cassandra), and I eventually came to terms with the fact that the Trojan Horse was in this version (the Trojan Horse was not in the Illiad, it was written about in the Aenied which was written a few hundred years later by Virgil and NOT Homer), and even that the Trojan war took place over the course of a few days instead of years but there are LOTS of things that suck about this movie.",2005
1,"Went to see the movie ""Troy"" this afternoon. Here's what I learned:",2004
7,This movie is quite long but very intense the whole way through. It has a good story line fair acting and some amazing production values. This movie has some of the best battle scenes I have ever seen in a movie like this and I have seen a lot.,2012
7,"I was wary at first of  Disney production of this film. I didn't want the cheesy Mighty Ducks type of sports movie, especially when dealing with the awesome task completed by these players. I thought the film makers did a nice job and the movie itself was quite entertaining. I think it exposes a whole generation to the 1980 U.S. hockey team and what they accomplished. Even though I am not a fan of Kurt Russell, I thought he was very good as Herb Brooks. He had the mannerisms and the voice down very well. Russell is a huge hockey fan himself so I know it was honor for him to play Brooks. For die hard hockey fans, this movie will entertain and it does not poison the game action or what it is really like to play hockey.",2004
8,Don't let the fact that this is a Disney movie deter you from watching a thoroughly enjoyable and adult-level sports movie for two-plus hours. Kurt Russell does an excellent job portraying coach Herb Brooks as a complex and sometimes ruthless and inscrutable leader. Very UN-Disney-like indeed. ,2005
8,"During the 2010 Winter Olympics, NBC broadcast a 30-minute documentary piece on the 1980 US Olympic ice hockey team. While I knew the story of how they beat the Soviets and won the Gold Medal (I had seen it live as a kid), I was expecting some clichéd rhetoric about the team and what they had done, akin to films like ""Knute Rockne, All American"" (1940) and ""Rocky"" (1976). I was pleasantly surprised to find that the story was anything but. The coach of that team, Herbert Brooks, was no hackneyed clone of a Knute Rockne or a Vince Limbardo. Instead he was a tight-fisted uncompromising hockey general who distanced himself from his players, more like a Bobby Knight than a Knute. This was not someone with whom teammates would feel comfortable having a beer. Instead, his inspiration to the players came from the other direction, by exposing their weaknesses and in some cases using unfairness and resentment as anchors from which to get the best out of his players. I decided that ""Miracle"" might be worth a look, especially as a prelude to the US vs Canada in the gold medal round of 2010 Olympic Hockey.",2010
6,"In 1980, Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell), a former Olympics hockey player cut from the winning 1960 U.S. team, put together a ragtag band of college hockey players, taking them to the Winter Olympics at Lake Placid to face the seemingly invincible Russian hockey team, winners of four successive gold medals. Miracle tells the true story of how they worked together to defy the odds working against them. Everyone likes a good upset especially when they can cheer on the winning team. Miracle gives you that story and its a nice film to watch with your family. I don't watch hockey because I don't really like it and its just not very appealing to me. But there's things that non-hockey fans can enjoy from this film. I liked the determination from the team and the inspiration the coach gave to them. Kurt Russell does an awesome job as Herb Brooks, probably his best performance in a long time. Patricia Clarkson does a good job playing his wife and all the players on the team aren't bad either. The one actor that was bad was Noah Emmerich, he just showed little to no emotion and didn't really put in a good effort. This wouldn't had been a problem if he had a small role but he was the assistant coach. Miracle is directed by Gavin O'Connor and he does a good job. The hockey itself wasn't actually that bad as some scenes of the game were pretty cool. The focus is on mainly on Russell and while you learn some stuff about the players it would had been nice if they had shifted some of the attention on them as well. The screenplay may be filled with clichés but the film does it right even if it feels like you have seen it before because you probably have. The film is 135 minutes long and for me it started dragging a little and getting kind of boring. The movie is also predictable so the ending game as well as the entire movie isn't really suspenseful. The focus is more on beating Russia then actually winning the medal. When they do play in the final game and win the medal, they only show them scoring the winning shot. After that Kurt Russell starts talking saying how they won the last game by coming up from behind. While we know the outcome to the whole thing it still would had been nice if they had added a few more scenes. Its also better then The Mighty Ducks but that's not a hard thing to do. Rating 7/10 a treat for hockey fans and a film that a normal movie-goer can enjoy.",2005
7,"Miracle is, in my book, a great sports film. Disney is finally able to come back with a smash hit sports film.

Standing against them is the seemingly invincible Russian squad who the team must overcome.",2005
9,"This was a pretty nice movie overall. It had its bad points but they were more subtle. The good stuff was out in front: the realistic hockey scenes and the inspiring true-life story of an amazing underdog sports team pulling off the ""miracle."" That, of course, was the 1980 United States Olympic hockey team winning the gold medal and along the way becoming the first team in 20 years to defeat the Soviets.",2006
10,Miracle is one of the better sports movies that I have seen. The movie portrays the United States team's unlikely Gold Medal victory at the 1980 Winter Olympics. It does one hell of a job at capturing one of the greatest moments in sports history.,2009
10,"Miracle is a Walt Disney movie about hockey. This sounds like Mighty Ducks, but believe me, it's not. Miracle stands on its own as a great movie. Disney has made true stories about sports in the past like Remember the Titans, and movies like that had the same Disney feel. Miracle is a movie for everyone to go see. It is a wonderful movie about a true game in history.",2008
7,"I stopped myself from chanting USA USA in the theater, because my wife would have left, but I still got emotional and raised my hands up when the US scored.  I still miss the Jets leaving the Peg, and still have the game reflexes when I watched the movie with a hockey crowd.  I remember watching most of the games when I was eleven.  Everyone hated the big Red machine from the Soviet Union, that killed the NHL all stars, and team USA afterward in a pre-Olympic game.  Part of the cold war fever taking place and this movie showed the importance of the game back in 1980. I was chanting USA USA while watching the game, live at home and remember Craig with the flag, all the players standing on the podium during the medal ceremony.  This must of had a huge influence on Hockey in the USA, and turned a lot of youngsters onto the game!  Being a hockey nut I remember watching the US during the 80's and they would lose in the first round at the Canada cups but with the younger players coming up they got better in every tournament, and finally made the cup final in 1992.  This event and the infusion of Canadian junior hockey coaches into their college system makes the US, the hockey power it is today.  Is is no longer just Canada and the Russians, I figure there will be many Canada, USA olympic gold medal games with maybe a movie about it one day.  Great hockey movie the advisors made the goaltending, and puck movement so real.  Russell looks and acts like a coach, from the coaching view, not the fan.  Brooks later became the coach of the Rangers, it was classy of them showing his picture at the end of the movie. 7 out of 10",2004
8,Rousing sports film about the 1980 U.S. Hockey team features some nicely shot game footage and a solid performance from Kurt Russell as the driven coach.

Both the Movie Miracle and the events which it chronicled were set in the year 1980. At this time there was great upheaval in the world because the US and the USSR were embattled in a prolonged cold war, where neither nation trusted the other. The competitive nature between the two countries was seen in all aspects but especially in sports. The Soviet hockey team at this time was considered to be unbeatable previously winning the Olympics for twenty years straight. The film follows Brooks on his journey to transform a group of young and inexperienced US Hockey players into a cohesive team and overcome the best hockey team in the world.",2011

9,"well, I haven't really read any books of Agatha Christie (except The Death on the Nile) and as a viewer, I found this series so enjoyable! and my favorite Miss Marple is Geraldine McEwan because i thought she amused me kind of sad she didn't continue but it's understandable! when the plot was sometimes didn't really work on me, I thought it's something that made me want to watch it more and ended up wanting to watch more. It's one of the first British TV series that I watched, and it's something that I wouldn't regret. Ms. Marple is such an unique and authentic character, and it's kind of unfortunate she didn't as popular as Poirot.",2014
9,...this isn't the greatest adaptation ever but who cares. I have great fun watching it and Geraldine McEwans is terrific as Miss Marple.,2011
10,"As many negative reviews as this series received for taking too much liberty of Dame Agatha Christie's original work, I must admit that I find it quite enjoyable to watch. I personally don't mind it changed some of Agatha's below-average original novels, and find a few of these adaptions quite interesting and even can be said as an improvement of to the original, especially for her late work such as At Bertram's Hotel, By the Pricking of My Thumbs, Nemesis and so on. The only one in my opinion goes way too far is Murder Is Easy. The incest element of this story could have made a decent episode of Midsomer Murders, but it's never for Agatha Christie adaptions and never will be! As for the cast, I like the portray of both McEwan and McKenzie, but find the two actresses too much of a contrary to each other, especially for the same character in a consecutive TV series. As for regular writers, Kevin Elyot's scripts are always relatively faithful ones, but sometimes it makes the film feel rather dull, most notably being A Pocket Full of Rye. Stewart Harcourt could always do some interesting changes while keeping the core of the original stories, I like most of his work except for Ordeal By Innocence. Paul Rutman wrote two episodes with quite different styles: They Do It with Mirrors is a rather faithful adaption to the original story, while The Secret of Chimneys is a total rewrite! As for Stephen Churchett, he's the one that brings many of his own ideas to the source material, sometimes they work to me, such as Nemesis and The Sittaford Mystery, and sometimes they don't, most notably being Sleeping Murder and, of course, Murder Is Easy, due to thieir incestious themes. But dare I say that as many people might criticize this series for its ""reinventing"" attempts, I still praise ITV's courage of trying to seek a new way to make Christie's work being accepted to the audience, despite the controversial feed backs.",2016

2,"Geraldine McEwan was a young looking 70-yr-old woman when she started making this series. For this part she was trying to be older which is all too obvious. She also speaks in a most peculiar and affected way; as though she is trying to put on a crusty accent but failing to do it without looking as though a great deal of effort is involved. It all adds up to terrible acting which could be forgiven were other actors pulling their weight. Unfortunately this is not the case. There are many ""guest actors"" (putting it politely) throughout the series who come from other backgrounds. Russ Abbot is a terrible comedian but a truly dismal actor and almost the same can be said for Dawn French. The whole series is rife with ""jobs for the boys"" (and girls) and this does Agatha Christie's stories a gross injustice. Don't bother with this series. It is absolutely abysmal. Yes, production techniques had improved by the noughties and yes... there are many lush flashback scenes that one doesn't find in earlier adaptations but this is not enough to make up for the sheer lack of any acting worth its salt. Instead of wasting time watching this series I'd urge anyone to watch the 1980s production instead with Joan Hickson playing the main part. It may be a bit dated but it's full of real actors who take a pride in their profession rather that egotists who are all trying to steal the limelight at the same time.",2012
1,"I read the book some years ago and enjoyed it, even though it was a little scary. This fiasco is nothing like the story told by Ms Christie and makes a mockery of a decent book. Geraldine McKewen is awful as Marple ( but then wait until you see Julia McKenzie she's even worse). In this 3rd rate adaptation we have a band of actors who have no reason to be there. It seems the makers had budget problems and spent it on poor script writers and even poorer actors (Dawn French!) It should state that it is LOOSELY BASED on the novel. It's a gripping tale of a woman from New Zealand who comes to England with her husband.She was told she was born and raised Iin NZ, but on house hunting she is drawn to a particular house and buys it. As she decorates and makes changes to the house, lots of coincidences occur and memories of being in the house before..........Please buy the Hickson version. It's filmed in Sidmouth, Devon.",2015

She succeeds only in making everybody else in the play seem exciting and interesting. So many actresses have bought their own particular take on Miss Marple. e.g Julia Mackenzie- warm,humorous, Joan Hickson-stern,forthwright. But you could be forgiven for assuming that Miss Mcewan is the deceased! And yet does seem to never receive any criticism for bringing nothing to what is a wonderful character that a lot of actresses would delight in playing.Sorry to speak ill of the dead but that is my overwhelming feeling. I've never seen Miss Mcewan in anything else to pass judgement on and do not have a grudge. But needed to say this as almost in a state of disbelief about this.",2016

Maybe the critic could do better but it's doubtful. As for the line that the Elven town looked like something out of a German city, so what? Didn't many of the concepts of Christmas begin in Germany? My family (two seniors, a twenty year old father, his 3, almost 4, year old son) loved it. The colors were brilliant. The number of elves dancing, singing, and rushing to create an entrance for Santa was outstanding. Santa, himself, proved to be exactly as he should. Intelligent, sturdy, and kind. His reindeer, just as impressive. Forgetting the North Pole and remarking on the rest of the movie, how well done! The artwork, just great. The excitement, our grandson was out of his chair and standing while holding onto the chair-back of the row in front of us. There were scenes that could have seemed somewhat scary for a youngster, he didn't find them so. He laughed several times out loud, had his eyes glued to the screen when something serious seemed to be happening, loved the entire movie. He wants the DVD for Christmas (he will have to wait a year). He also told us that he wants to see the movie once more before Christmas.

To his delight, the roller-coaster ride complete his beliefs in one night giving him the opportunity to mend his thoughts to reaffirm Mr Claus .",2012
6,"For the first 10 minutes this film is a delight. The filmmakers and animators must have worked themselves into a frazzle to get this amount of detail and style into the film - the human characters look as if they were both rotoscoped AND computer animated, and all the inanimate or inorganic elements of the film - the landscapes, the houses, the trees, the Polar Express itself - are dazzling. If the movie had been a 22 minute 'short' (a la ""Merry Christmas, Charlie Brown""), it would have been one of the all time classics of Christmas animation. Unfortunately, Zemeckis and company felt they needed to expand ""Polar Express"" into a feature length movie, and the source material can't hold up to the extended length.",2005
7,"I try not to have expectations when I go to see films. Often, my problem is usually that I'm excited about a film's opening, and my expectations are usually high. In the case of ""The Polar Express"", my expectations were actually pretty low.",2011
1,"The Polar Express. Director Robert Zemeckis, I love Back to the Future, Forrest Gump, Contact, and Who Framed Roger Rabbit (NO QUESTION MARK AFTER THAT MOVIE TITLE!!). And Tom Hanks, one of my favorite actors. The reviews of this movie were almost unanimous saying that this is an instant holiday classic. Ebert & Roeper give it two ENTHUSIASTIC thumbs up! Even Ebert's written review gave it a full four stars! Wow... OK... this I gotta see! But wait... the motion capture used looks really weird. Hmm... maybe I'm NOT so interested in seeing this anymore.",2004
10,"I think this movie deserves a higher rating than a 6.6 on IMDb. I know its just an opinion to everyone else, but I just don't think it deserves to be ignored because ""The Polar Express"" is one of the greatest experience that I have ever seen, since when it first came out back in 2004 in IMAX 3D. My favorite part in IMAX 3D is where the train starts to go too fast, and we get this awesome experience that you are on a roller coaster ride. I felt like that I was part of that ride, and it was like ""WOW!"" Of course, I am only watching this in 2D which is fine but it will never be the same experience as what the IMAX 3D did. So, with that said, ""The Polar Express"" is about a boy who doesn't believe as he gets on a magical train known as the Polar Express as it leads up to the North Pole so he and the rest of the children are about to go see Santa Claus on Christmas Eve late at night. I don't know if the movie has a message but if it does, then I thought it is well done as we should know that seeing is believing as it for us on what we believe. The animation in this movie is spectacular, and I thought the animators did a great job on rendering these characters to make them look real. Of course, you can argue about on why Robert Zemeckis should have just shot this movie in live action instead of animating it. So, what do I know because I honestly don't know; maybe it is just for that kind of style as they are trying to make these characters to be more faithful to the book. Anyway, I thought Zemeckis does a great job on making this movie, and making this a whole lot of fun. Tom Hanks does a wonderful job to work with motion capture as he is playing each character that he is doing; it is also kind of hard on which actor or actress is voicing these characters or doing motion capture but I will leave that up to you. Nevertheless, Hanks was really good in it. The music by Alan Silvestri is very well scored, and the songs that he teamed up with Glen Ballard are pretty good too. I also don't mind if the filmmakers had to add new scenes that have nothing to do with the book, because folks, the book is short so that is probably why they had to expand the book into a movie that is over an hour an a half long. I was fine with it, and have nothing to complain about. So, enough talking about who or what is having problems with this movie, I just thought ""The Polar Express"" is a wonderful experience and would love if this was brought back into theaters, as well as showing it in IMAX 3D. I give this movie a 10 out of 10.",2014
2,"I just watched this with my kids last night. I'm sorry, but I just can't square this Santa and North Pole with a standard like that of ""Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer."" In ""Rudolph"" it was full of love and humor, forgiveness and humility. This Polar Express version is dark, authoritarian, and punitive. I also can't believe it earned a ""G"" rating with so much excessive danger and stressful suspense (train on the ice, Christmas star nearly killing an elf, etc) - my three-year old got scared and had to turn her head six times! How awful! (She kept coming back because her 6-year old brother was still watching.)",2007
5,"I'm a huge fan of Chris Van Allsburg, and especially his book, ""Polar Express."" I love Tom Hanks.",2004
1,"""The Polar Express "" was an awful movie. What makes this movie worst is the hypocrisy to present itself as a innocent,s sugary and harmless tale for children about the ""true "" meaning of Christmas. I never read the book of Chris Van Allsburg in what it was inspired, but the most disappointing is that it was directed by Robert Zemeckis, the same director who made the great animated film ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"", an excellent movie where he proved that the animation could be appreciated for kids and adults as well, while in this movie it seems that he was victim of his own ambition and he give too much importance to give the characters impressive level of detail and ""realism"" rather than a interesting story. ",2007
2,"I'll give this movie three ""C""s for Creepy, Cold, and Charmless.",2005
3,"I would first like to name the positive aspects of the film, as to make it fair: The characters were wonderfully rendered. Tom Hanks did a good job and, unlike others, I didn't find them to be creepy. The backgrounds were great. You could almost feel the cold of the night while watching. The most delicious eye-candy available.",2006
2,"What an abysmal piece of trash. This is nothing but a lame attempt to use Hanks as a vehicle to cash in on some new 'technology'. The film is a total dud. Dumb, boring, annoying, irritating...I mean everyone looks like a freakin' mannequin, but oh wait, they MOVE realistically. So amazing. Too bad the novelty wears off in what, the first minute?",2004
2,I do think Tom Hanks is a good actor. I enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little. I was very disappointed in the movie. One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard. There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene. There are some characters and scenes that seem scary for little children for whom this movie was made. The North Pole scenes with Santa and the elves could have been cute and charming. There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters. It usually doesn't work to make a short children's book into a feature film. This movie totally grates on my nerves.,2008
1,"This movie is awful. It creates characters not in the book, and some of them are ethnic or racial stereotypes. Including an obnoxious little Jewish boy and a politically correct little black girl. Not to mention the Yiddish speaking elves. The book was a simple story about belief, and this movie is a dark, ugly, and needlessly scary movie about nothing.",2004
9,"When we watched this wonderful movie, we absolutely forgot where we were. The minute it starts, it gets your attention and keeps it until the very end. You enter a truly magical world.",2005
1,For one this is not a kids movie. It was scary for anyone who watches it with those horrifying cgi faces and the bum/thief/ghost on the top of the train. He scared me and I am 27. Imagine a small kid viewing that despicable man. Blockbuster should burn their copies of this movie or put it in the horror section right away. The best comment I read was the description of the north pole looking like Nazi Germany...how true. It was a place without snow. What North Pole story shouldn't have snow and why make it look like a nuclear power plant.,2006
8,"It took me a long time to see this movie, but I finally did when my sister got it as a gift. Although the movie had its incredibly corny moments, and the plot was obviously written to entertain a preteen audience, I did find the movie enjoyable. There will be times during this movie when you will just have to laugh, and there will be times that you nod as you remember similar antics of your own. The characters are lovable and realistic, even if some of the messes they get into may not be. Granted, there will also be times when you just have to roll your eyes at the cheesiness. Overall, I found the movie very cute and very entertaining;just don't send your boys to watch it.",2006
1,I was recently sick with the flu and unable to move from the bed and because the movie channel repeats movies a certain amount of times in a twenty four hour period I ended up watching this movie 3 times.,2006
6,"I thought this movie was quite enjoyable. It's a bit like a female version of Ferris Bueller, without the destructive male testosterone (the worst thing the girls can expect if caught is not to be able to go on a trip to Hawaii with the family). Even though everything is predictable (the dorky guys who save the day ... more than once, the popular girl getting her comeuppance, the ""fat"" girl learning to love herself, etc.) you don't seem to mind because the characters are well-developed and so, well, likable. It's not going to challenge you to use your brain much, but for a few hours of fun, this isn't bad. Will appeal especially to pre-teen and teen girls.",2004
8,"So many movies nowadays either have young kids acting too old, or old people pretending to be young. Sleepover is just an above average teenie-bopper movie with some really fun moments and nice performances by a talented young cast. This target audience doesn't have a lot of movies to be proud of, but Sleepover can definitely be considered a fun one. All of the performances seemed on the money. Alex Vega (Julie) and Scout Taylor-Compton (Farrah) seemed to shine. There are a couple of very funny scenes from Steve Carell who plays an over-the-top security guard looking to break up the girl's fun. I commend director Joe Nussbaum for tackling a difficult genre and age group, and doing a commendable job with it. Don't rent it expecting anything deep, but it certainly is a good time.",2005
5,this movie is very cool and funny in way but not to enjoyable not the best movie i had ever seen but is cool. All the actors were very good especially Alexa Vega And Kallie as Yancy the typical loser type girl who managed to find friends at a sleepover. The story is about a group of friends who join in at a scavenger hunt against popular Queens. They get things wrong at first but they make way Alexa Vega gets to dance with her prince in the end at the dance. This movie is ideal for teen girls who live in a fantasy.i also love to watch the prince and me and comedies so try the prince and me it is a bit soppy but if you like other things watch like this movie i like stuck in the suburbs i love it!,2006
2,"This movie is downright terrible. Usually I like cheesy movies because they are so stupid and pointless that you can laugh at them, but this movie is just all-around awful. There are many reasons that this movie is bad, so I'll list them here: ",2012

3,"Oh, dear. Oh, dear. I hardly know where to start.",2005
3,"This movie is a complete load of ""enchanting"" unrealistic crap. I get a wild kick out of bad movies and this one takes the cake for 2004. First of all the fat girl who they had to name ""Yancy"" to match her unattractive character (Kallie Flynn Childress), is not featured on the cover of the box because somehow American 14 year old girls won't relate with other chubby girls? Plus, when they sneak into the club while fatty waits outside, she's approached by a sweet heavy set charmer who is working on a gig there that night. Clearly in order for him to work in a bar, he has to be at least 21, which is of course is a perfectly acceptable age to hit on a 14 YEAR OLD GIRL! And while Joe Nussbaum is advocating pedophilia, why not condone the high school senior to fall in like with Julie (Alexa Vega), before she even attends his school. I remember in MY high school, only the coolest and most popular guys would court girls 4 years younger than them, as apposed to dating attractive mature girls their own age. Why stop at middle school Steve Faris, when there is plenty of kindergarten girls with your head shot tacked above they're bed surrounded by glittered hearts? If you're ready to play your home version of Mystery Science Theater 3K I HIGHLY recommend ""Sleepover"".",2006
2,Sleepover is a great movie. For anyone under the age of 10 that is.,2012
10,"First impressions can be misleading. This seemed a fun romp, the sort of thing that gets labelled as girlie and which I tend to find addictive to the point of wanting to rate it as 10 or 9 or, in this case 8. This does not appear to have anything like the depth of Heathers or Clueless or Practical Magic, etc, so 10 felt wrong. It did not seem to be at the level of addictive sugar of lesser depth, so 9 felt wrong. Yet it is still addictive, to those who like this sort of girlie romp? ",2009
1,"I didn't know what kind of film it was until I was in the middle of it, and couldn't get out :) I tried to tell my self that if I were a 13-14 year old girl, this film might hit someone. But the more i saw, the more that thought slipped away. As always in such American films it gets nauseous in the end. Bad acting, bad lines and bad script! Some of the reasons why it always goes wrong in such teen films, is because: 1. Its unrealistic (bad script) 2. Bad acting (very bad lines) 3. Bad casting",2005
9,"I thought this movie would be a typical boy-getting story with two gangs who hate each other. I was half right - there was two gangs but there was only a bit about boys inside. It was really fun watching Alexa Vega on screen as a girly girl - she's quite pretty. The dares were hilarious and really original! The cop added an extra funny part as well. It was really sweet when Steve met Julie, but the movie was pretty predictable, and it was obvious Julie's gang would win. The part I didn't like was the part when Stacy danced with that skateboard guy. I thought Stacy should feel even more bad, yes, I like revenge. All over all, the movie was really good and really cool!",2005
9,"I went and saw this movie for free because I won ticket's to the Mall of America's ""World's Largest Sleepover"" I though the movie was going to be really stupid and not funny at all. But watching the movie I found myself laughing a ton and I ended up really liking the movie, and not just because Sean Faris was in it. My mom even thought it was a good movie. The jokes weren't real childish and were actually funny, and whoever wrote that last comment probably doesn't know how to have fun (no offense to you). The acting was great, and Alexa Vega really showed that she can do more than kiddy action type movies. And Sean Faris really proves himself to be a great actor and I think he'll be the next Orlando Bloom or Ashton Kutcher. And like I said, the jokes were actually good in this movie. Which is why I gave Sleepover 8/10 stars.",2004
6,"I wasn't expecting much from ""sleepover"", other than Alexa Vega, so good in the ""Spy Kids"" movies for Robert Rodriguez, I didn't know anyone in the cast. So i found my self smiling, laughing and even nervous to see if Julie Corky (Vega) and her friends would win out.",2006
1,I really think it is rather pointless to go down the enormous list of grand immorality and deceit that was in this film to say the least.,2005
1,"Wow. I must say, Sleepover is one of the absolute worst films I've ever seen in my whole life. Being a huge movie buff (I have a home theater system and I rent movies every Saturday night and go to one in the theaters every Friday night). Want to know why the film is so bad? Let's start off with the characters. Every single one of them is so shallow and one-dimensional. Julie, the main character, bitches about her perfect life, is self-absorbed and selfish, and is mean to her parents who just want to make her life better. Same with all the rest of the characters. The acting is just so bad it makes me sick. Alexa Vega has got as much acting ability as a Barbie doll, and the usually good Mika Boorem is awful as well. Sleepover also encourages bad behavior (the girls sneaking out of the house, sneaking into a bar, causing havoc in an Old Navy store). The plot has as much redeeming quality as a paper bag. Do 14/15 year old girls still listen to Spice Girls and go on scavenger hunts? Does it really matter that all this was to sit at the ""popular fountain""? And yes, you guessed it, the ending is that Julie gets the guy and wins a spot at the popular people's fountain. And, what's slightly disturbing is that the guy Julie gets is like, 18 or 17 while she is still like 14/15. In conclusion, AVOID Sleepover like the black plague.",2005
3,"I've read many of the reviews that everyone's posted for this movie, and I have to say that I do agree with a good number of them. The first time I saw this movie was at a sleepover/birthday party. The first movie we watched was Mean Girls and I'm like, this is great. But then we pop in Sleepover and I'm like what the heck? I actually liked it a little just because it was fun, in a sense, but it doesn't have the makings of a great movie by any means. Everyone's pretty much covered the acting, stereotypes, and story line of this movie. All negative, unfortunately. This movie *could* have been okay, but they totally blew it with the stereotypes and everything. Movies aren't supposed to be totally realistic, but they shouldn't have one-dimensional characters. That just makes you more angry when you watch it. And I actually didn't notice the whole age difference between Julie and Steve, and Yancy and that Peter guy. That *is* a little wacko...I mean it was all so predictable how they would find that one *dream guy*...but it could have at least been someone closer in age. I've seen some out there stuff, but this is just one cliché filled movie that I sometimes watch for fun and nostalgia.",2006
8,"I LOVE this movie. I feel it so cute and reminds me of being growing up. Sure I never did dress a mannequin but some the thing about the boxers uh I'll plead the 5th. People seem to forget at that age you can sometimes be fearless. I grew up in a small town and some of those things were and are possible. And with the things that aren't well, isn't that why we watch movies and love Hollywood? I mean was I asleep and Star Wars did happen? Overall this movie is funny and entertaining to girls and younger ones. I mean I wouldn't make my dad watch it but if you do you will not have to worry about turning red. The is a wonderful innocence with this movie with out having to be very cheesy.",2005
1,"Sleepover is by far the single most insulting movie I have seen since I stupidly rented Terror Toons from my local Blockbuster. I ordered Sleepover just to laugh at how bad it was, but this movie is no laughing matter. No, this movie isn't intended for the age group it is about. The truth is, no self-respecting fourteen year old would ever watch this movie for anything other than masochistic reasons. This stupid movie was just a get rich quick scam by the studio to cash in on the tween craze, a la other crap like the Lizzy Maguire Movie and Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen. These movies are an effort to sell, not to entertain. I can just imagine 8 year old girls watching this movie and thinking their so mature because they're watching a movie about girls in their early teens. This movie feeds them the same social stereotypes that they will no doubt feel the need to live up to, like the terrible rich blonde girl and the fat girl with the heart of gold. And no, in real life, no one would ever say ""Oh, for the love of carbs."" I only wish I could've given this movie a 0 instead of a 1. If you see this movie at a Blockbuster or at someone house, burn it, stomp on it, and eat the remains. You'll be doing the world a favor.",2005

6,this movie is really good.the movie is fun to watch for the whole family.kids and adults alike would love the movie.but especially the teens can relate their lives to this movie.the cast was excellent showing real life portrayals where in an ordinary girl starts high school and how she manages to be the princess of her night with her crush.overall i really enjoyed seeing the movie and would like to see the sequels of this movie in the future.the movie shows the basic ethics of friendship where the leading actor misses her friend because she wont be studying high school with her anymore and it also shows how kind hearted and generous the character portrays.the other gang of girls who are snobbish learn their lesson when they realize they have only geeks as their partners for the night.but the escape is truly amazing.how they escape is great fun to watch.and the best part if the movie is the climax where the hero takes the crown and waits for his girl and one more good part of the movie is the scavenger hunt which is very different from the other movies and the comedy part is they have to include Steve;s accessories.it was fun to see them playing with the mannequins in the shop with the cop not noticing what these girls are up to.again i say its a good movie,2006
6,"After the disappointing effort of the first Scooby-Doo film I wasn't much enthusiastic about this ""Monsters Unleashed"". But to tell the truth this film handled the characters better and the climax more interesting, at least in terms of the identity of the villain. It remained true to the original cartoon storyline in the sense that the character of the villain appeared earlier in the film. The dialogues also got better, though abandoning thick sense of humor was impossible. It failed to develop enough chemistry between the members of the gang, which is in fact faithful to the cartoon where in my opinion the characters are quite one-dimensional.",2006

The humor has also been improved and this movie actually does have some entertaining and funny moments in it.",2005

10,"This movie was a funny look back at all the episodes of Scooby-Doo. I thought that putting all the evil characters from their other mysteries was brilliant. In this movie Daphne is much smarter. Sure she has a few stupid moments, but overall she has intelligence and wit. Sarah Michelle Gellar did a wonderful performance as this character. Shaggy and Scooby were of course you're regular brainless heroes who somehow end up saving the day. Mathew Lillard was exceptionally well in playing his role, and didn't overact. Velma,(Linda Cardellini) was still the same old Velma. Linda Cardellini fit the role expected of her and made the movie well rounded. Freddie Prinze Jr.(Fred) made his character less Narcesistic as he was before. Fred is still the committed leader who loves his admirers and especially Daphne.",2004
6,"The original Scooby Doo was bad.  It couldn't decide if it was a straight live action version or a parody of Scooby Doo.  That movie had an obnoxious tone to it.  The sequel, however, is better.  The action seems to be moving faster than the original.  There are no fewer than three of the famous foot chases that Scooby Doo is famous for.  The movie doesn't make a lot of sense, but it is going too fast for anybody to notice.  The actors seem more comfortable in their roles this time around, especially Freddie Prinze, Jr. as Fred.  Prinze was incredibly smug in the first movie.  This time he seems to have dialed it down more.  The actors are performing more as a team this time.  These are people who like each other in this movie and not as five individuals.  This is not a great movie, with unnecessary amounts of grotesque humor.  Alicia Silverstone is wasted in a minor role.  Overall, get a free ticket if you can to see in a theatre or rent it on video. 6/10",2004

2,"Scooby Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed (2004): Dir: Raja Gosnell / Cast: Freddie Prinze Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar, Matthew Lillard, Linda Cardellini, Alicia Silverstone: Scooby Doo was a wonderful cartoon full of mystery and humour as well as memorable characters. This sequel is about fear but not just of monsters but of failure. After a disaster at a museum Shaggy and trusted dog Scooby Doo are blamed. Ridiculous plot regards the unleashing of monsters that Mystery Inc had already put away. Often corny and even the visual effects are horrid. The only exception is Scooby Doo himself who translated well through CGI visuals. Raga Gosnell directed the first film and plays off creative angles but acting is to the bare minimum. Freddie Prinze Jr. substitutes Fred's brains for stupidity. Sarah Michelle Gellar creates an unnecessary sexed up Daphne. Matthew Lillard plays Shaggy on perfect key but the role here is a mere prop as oppose to a personality. It is as if he was part of a vintage sideshow. Linda Cardellini does look like Velma but even the makeup job cannot bring the character to life. Alicia Silverstone appears as a reporter in her worst performance since her embarrassing turn as Batgirl in Batman and Robin. Perhaps she and Uma Thurman should both take a hint and avoid all films that involve superheroes and such. It is pointless candy coated dog snot. Score: 2 / 10",2015
3,"I realize that Scooby Doo 2 is basically a kids' movie. I realize that I am long past the target audience's age. And, I realize that it's a sequel to a movie I didn't care for. However, I grew up a fan of the original Scooby Doo cartoon. I was 6 years-old when the cartoon originally aired and I have fond memories of those Saturday mornings. The people responsible for making these movies have taken most of what made that show good and thrown it out the window. The ghosts and monsters weren't real. There was always a rational explanation behind everything that went on. Part of the fun was trying to wrap my 6 year-old brain around how the bad guys were doing their evil deeds. But a movie based in anything approaching reality wouldn't work as a big, over-bloated, CGI mess like Scooby Doo 2. It's unreal, it's loud, and it leaves nothing to the imagination. The film consistently makes fun of itself in that I'm-smarter-than-you, self-referential way that I find so annoying. It's a shame to me that young kids today will not grow-up understanding the charm of the original Scooby Doo.",2006

5,"I suppose I was never that crazy about the show. It just didn't really grab me. I don't have a problem with others enjoying it, and I can see the logic in making these flicks for those who loved it. The main problem is just that it really doesn't have anything to offer for anyone else. It does, in both of them, try to offer it up, and were it further developed, perhaps coupled with less thin, stereotypical characters to work with, I think they could really have something interesting. The acting tends to be over the top, which is not to say that there are no good performances, or at least moments of such. Green is a nice addition. There are more monsters than in the first one. The CGI is at the same level of quality, that being quite good. This has fairly well-done cinematography and editing. The jokes and gags are almost exclusively silly, and if you're watching this, hopefully you enjoy bodily function jokes. This has a pretty decent plot, and throws some genuine surprises your way. The twist is reasonable. Designs are imaginative and fun. The music is cool. So is it better than its predecessor? I guess it averages out to them being about equal. I recommend this to fans of Scooby-Doo and co. 5/10",2009

I was a first generation Scooby fan, watching it every Saturday morning year in and year out in the early 1970s, until Scrappy Doo drove me away. We got to know and care for those characters. Amazingly, they're not here. Who are these people, this redhead, blond and brunette? They're certainly not Daphne, Fred and Velma. Freddie Prinze, Jr. was simply channeling Owen Wilson. Helium-voiced Sarah Michelle Gellar is all wrong for stunning Daphne. And Linda Cardinelli was too whiny to be calm, collected Velma. I'm not even going to ask about all the sudden techno-wizardry and the fighting skills. Not to mention the original Mystery Machine gang NEVER went up against actual ghosts, not even once. They always exposed the ghosts to be a fraud. This wasn't Scooby Doo. It was Ghostbusters meets Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The only good thing about this movie was Matthew Lillard, who was the only cast member to truly capture the spirit (and voice) of the cartoon character.",2005
3,"I watched this movie on my portable DVD player. Whenever I watched an apparent horror movie, I use a book, just in case I have to cover up the screen. I needed it quite a few times while watching THIS movie! ",2015
10,"It's not today that Scooby-Doo has entertained thousands of people. And had the bright idea of making a movie with real people, bringing the magic of design for real life. Not to mention the wonderful acting of the cast and the ""poker face"" of the character of Alicia Silverstone. This is surely the best live-action adaptation of a cartoon as well known and respected as the Hanna Barbera. This until be replaced and succeeded by the horrible ""Scooby-Doo: The Mystery Begins,"" which completely escapes the vital characteristics of the characters. This movie gets to overcome the first part. Not to mention the success of the film, and the cleverness of the actors who took this role in the prime of their careers.",2014
10,I love the Scooby doo cartoons and I think this movie was great. The first Scooby movie was great to but this one is more like the cartoons.,2004
10,"I saw this movie on opening day. To let you know I am a total Scooby Doo fan, and was totally excited about Scooby coming to the big screen, so when I saw the first one I was in total Doo heaven, and then the news about a sequal made my heart skip to the happy sounds of joy. So when I saw this movie I was totally pleased with this sequels outcome. There was so much more in this one then the original. Especially the whole dancing Scooby in the whole soul getup. Thought I was going to pee my pants from laughing so hard. So for all those who don't know what a good movie then you need to really get yourself a reality check. This movie is for kids, and for the adults who have the little kid in their hearts.",2004
10,"Alrighty folks. I am true blue Scooby Doo fan. Have been since I first began watching the cartoons on televisions (thank you re-runs). And when I heard that Cooby was coming to the big screen. I was so for this project. The first film was freaking hilarious, and new that the second was going to topple that one, and boy did it. More laughs, more scares, and more Doo. The whole plot was unique, and was totally fabulous to watch. I was laughing so bad that I was in tears. The whole 70's Dancing Scooby, I thought I was going to pee my pants from laughing so hard. This movie is the one to watch. It kept true to the old cartoon. I wished they added some more Ghosts from the original series. Oh well there is always Scooby Doo 3.",2004
10,"Raja Gosnell did a much better job on this film. Although I'm slightly biased for this film (due to the fact that I watched some of the filming in Vancouver and Stanley Park) I believe this movie felt more like an episode of ""Scooby-Doo Where Are You?"" than the first. Characters and plot are greatly developed. This movie was especially brilliant in that the characters and story were able to be more complex all the while it stuck to it's basic roots. Monster/see the gang (exposition) - Masked figure Problem/who's to blame (rising action) - more thefts/ find monster source (climax) - destroy the source/unmask the masked figure (conclusion). The comedy (though dry on a couple jokes) was much better and unexpected at times than the first. My conclusion: Bunny.",2004
6,"The story's not overly engaging, but for some reason Along Came Polly is fun. Ben Stiller just has that knack of being able to embarass himself and we love him for it. You can't help but laugh. But the film is worth a look for Philip Seymour Hoffman, too, as the child actor still looking for recognition -- and work. The basketball court scene is great, but the best is his performance with a community theatre's production of Jesus Christ Superstar. If you've ever been in community theatre, or you've hung out with actors, you'll appreciate this.",2004
10,"i thought this film was really well scripted and acted i thought it was very funny and is a must watch. if you don't already have this movie should definitely go buy or rent it i couldn't stop laughing all the way through i think you would enjoy this if you like my super ex-girlfriend ,bresk-up and other comedy/chick flicks. the film shows a married couple who break up on there honeymoon after the wife is caught in bed with a scuba diving instructor. then after Reuben Feffer(Ben Stiller) gets home he meets old class mate Polly (jennifer aniston) and falls in love with her that is all OK until the wife comes back and tries to take back Reuben feffer",2006
10,"I am surprised at the comments that I have read so far that suggest this is a boring or mediocre movie.  All that I know is that I am a 46 year old married mother, and I just spent 90 minutes laughing out loud (too loud sometimes) and smiling. I can imagine that if you are easily offended by fart ( or ""shart"") jokes or the shiny hiney's of Ben Stiller or Hank Azaria, you may not like this movie.  But really, then, why would you go in the first place?  I was definitely not bored.  The characters were all so much fun- the kind of creepy boss, the obnoxious but extremely lovable best friend, the risk expert who finds something to worry about in any situation, the goofy, scatterbrained ferret- owning waitress/creepy children's book author, the australian who likes to free fall off of tall buildings, the priceless scuba instructor, and the very cute salsa dancer.  Anyway, I loved it , and I'll probably even go see it again.",2004
7,"I thought this was about a silly romance, so I didn't see it when it first came out. I rented the DVD and I liked it so much I watched it again with my daughter two nights later. I should have known Ben Stiller wouldn't do a totally ""straight"" movie, but the comedy wasn't so over the top either. It was a perfect blend of comedy and sincerity. One of the stand-out performances came from Hank Azaria. His portrayal of the French scuba instructor, Claude, was a scene-stealer. One of the funniest characters I've seen in a long time. I recommend this as a perfect date movie, or if you're just sitting at home and want to LOL! Be sure to check out the gag reel.",2005
6,"Once again, Ben Stiller gives us yet another comedy, about love, life and being an adult nerd. Yet, this sadly doesn't hold a candle to 'Something About Mary', which may have been his best movie of his career.",2006
10,"I went to see this movie with an open mind, thinking another silly comedy, no it is not that. ""Along came Polly"" is just plain funny from beginning to end. It has been a long time since a movie makes me laugh so much. I needed that! may be, we do not get emotionally involved with the main characters, but it is as well, we all went through the kind of experiences that Reuben lives, and I don't have the need to feel them again, I know ... and, this is what makes the movie hilarious. Alec Baldwin is totally surprising, I won't say more...The movie theatre was jammed packed, at the end, the audience erupted with a huge bravo and cheers. A movie not to miss : ""Along came Polly"" is a 10+!",2004
7,"Ben Stiller is known for wacky characters such as White Goodman from Dodgeball, Tony Perkis in Heavy Weights, and the male model known as Derek Zoolander in Zoolander. But his other roles have been the quiet yet hysterical characters like Gaylord 'Greg' Focker in Meet the Parents and Meet the Focker's. This type of character is perfect for Stiller.",2005
4,"The film belongs to the demential genre, it's a comedy like ""There's something about Mary"" -actually there's the same actor, and the same screenwriter of recent Ben Stiller movies as well.",2005
5,"Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston lead a talented cast and for the most part deliver the laughs. Reuben Feffer {Ben Stiller} is looking for a new relationship after walking in on his wife {Debra Messing} with a scuba diving instructor {Hank Azaria}. While at a party he sees Polly {Jennifer Aniston} this girl he used to go to school with, they start dating and Reuben is trying to act more loose for Polly since Polly is very loose. The plot is very similar to There's Something About Mary and it even steals from an episode of Friends. The film is not very original so that's one strike against it lucky for the film it has a funny cast. What really makes this movie work is Philip Seymour Hoffman, he is hilarious as Sandy and he is the best part about this movie. The rest of the supporting cast is funny including Hank Azaria as the scuba instructor and Alex Baldwin as Reuben's boss. Ben Stiller is funny but its getting tiring to see him in the same role. Jennifer Aniston pretty much plays her Rachel character and she's enjoyable. The problem though is that Ben and Jen don't make a realistic couple. We have also seen it all before so there's no reason to rush out and see this film. Rating 7/10, a funny movie that's worth a look",2005
1,"I saw this for free, thankfully, and wish it was better than it was, but it's really the same old stuff that movie studios seem to foist on us in the last ten years.",2004
10,"Hilarious movie with excellent play from Ben Stiller... Ben Stiller plays a ""Risk analyst"" (and he is the most cautious man on earth, quote: ""you don't eat mixed nuts on a bar everybody knows that"" and ""I don't take the subway home because you a 1 to 45000 risk to get into a serious accident"") and the first day of his honeymoon his wife cheats on him...And along came Polly, an old friend from school. And Polly isn't quite the one she used to be... Sure there are many clichés but that isn't really important. Mr.Deeds meets What women want... A lot of funny scenes... Jennifer Aniston as Polly Prince Ben Stiller as Reuben Feffer",2005
9,"I first saw this movie several years ago -- not in the theatre, but pretty soon after it went to DVD. I have now watched it several times in its entirety, and it seems when I'm flipping channels and it's on Showtime or HBO, I'll tune in for a few minutes and then get hooked again. Oh my god, Philip Seymour Hoffman is worth it alone -- between the sharting, the basketball game, and the community theatre presentation of ""Jesus Christ Superstar"", I am a wheezing mess by the end of this film from laughing so hard. And, every time I watch it, I appreciate someone else's performance, or see some added nuance that I might have missed before. I think this is Ben Stiller's best film by far. It will remain a classic in our household for years to come.",2012
9,"I heard this movie was a hard sell, which is probably why I ended up enjoying it so thoroughly. The movie is far from perfect  the talented cast is somewhat misdirected - but it's their talent, along with the hilarious circumstances that unfold throughout the film's neat 90 min running time, which keeps the film moving and the laughter rolling. Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston strike a nice contrast as the fated couple united by a hysterical comedy of errors. Philip Seymour Hoffman is wonderful as Stiller's pitiful (and only) friend and confidant. And Alec Baldwin steals every scene in which he appears (would love to see him do more comedy).",2004
7,"It starts off slowly because you need to be set up for the story line. Once it picks up, it becomes side splitting.",2005
2,This film offers absolutely no imagination in it's premise nor in it's execution but these are just two things that come to mind after watching this so-called comedy that has no energy to speak of. Story is about nit-picky over analytical insurance risk manager Reuben Feffer (Ben Stiller) who finds his new wife Lisa (Debra Messing) cheating on him with a scuba instructor (Hank Azaria) after only one day on their honeymoon. Upon returning home Reuben and his best friend Sandy (Philip Seymour Hoffman) go to a party and run into Polly Prince (Jennifer Aniston) whom they went to school with years earlier.,2005
10,"Great plot, incredibly funny minor characters such as: the Great Hank Azaria (he's responsible for the voices of Apu, Moe, Chief Wiggum and others on ""the simpsons"", by the way) in an absolutely unrecognizable body, playing the role of Claude, a French scooba instructor you'll love to meet. The wonderful Philip Seymour Hoffman (""Happiness"", ""Magnolia"") in one of his funniest roles, and he does a great job at this comedy, in a very physical performance! White Chocolate, let it rain! He plays the traditional ""best friend"" part, but every time he comes on the screen it's a celebration. With his legs spread in his yellow shorts, torn right in the middle  doesn't get more human than that. Bryan Brown adds more flavor with his extreme sports enthusiasm, and there's nothing like skipping to a frantic hand held camera in a squash match in the middle of a steadily shot film. Alec Baldwin is also part of the cast, and it's great to see him at it. Jennifer Anniston plays the girl, and its so refreshing to see such a lead lady. She's genuine, funny, free spirited, unlike most plastic female characters you mostly see. Plus she's incredibly sexy when dancing Salasa, and there's a few points in those scenes when the resemblance to ""Dirty Dancing"" is so ridiculous that you can't help but embrace this Director to your heart. Ben Stiller is energetic as usual, and we go along with him every minute of it. Yes, there is a ""water rising in the toilet"" joke, but it's really funny in this movie, because Anniston is sitting right outside of the toilet door waiting for Stiller, when the water starts streaming from under it. And when he leaves, he's holding the Lufa so he'll throw it on his way out. It's just very real, and very funny. A lot of Slapstick, a lot of seemingly ""low"" humor, but it's just SO funny seeing that slow motion shot of someone's hairy belly rubbing ALL over Ben Stiller's face during a basketball matchAlong Came Polly manages to be a real fun Comedy with a true sense of kindness, love, and humor. Very much recommended for a night of DVD. I didn't see it at the cinema so I don't know how that may be.",2004

9,"Ned's the Classified School Survival Guide was one of those shows that I watched while doing homework, projects, or any ""educational"" type work that I had to do. Since I had plenty of those to do, NCSSG became a daily show that I JUST HAD TO WATCH. Every time I watched it, I laughed out loud. I mean, really loud. I even experienced some accidents while watching the show.(Not entirely true) Not only does it make me laugh, but it really taught me a lot about school. I know that most of the stuff is over exaggerating,but Ned's tips helped me tremendously during school hours. Ned's somewhat a middle school philosopher. The whole point is, the show is freaking awesome.",2007
8,"I admit it, other than a few shows on Sci-Fi and HGTV, I don't watch much television, unless one of the kids of the house is. So quite often, we wind up watching cartoons or kid's programs. Which was what got me watching ""Ned's Declassified"" to begin with.",2007
10,"I love how everything on this show is so unrealistic, like digging tunnels, flushing toilets, or riding through the hallway on the janitor's cleaning machines. And yet, it's so realistic; the vice principal, the crushes, spirit week, everything. So many tips have helped me, too, such as reducing redness of a pimple, bullying, and pre-setting your locker without anyone being able to open it. This show is great for kids because it will really help help them in middle school all through high school, and great for adults because of it's true, hilarious, random humor. This is one show I really hope lasts a while on Nick. Whoever writes the script must be an expert on what school is really like, and how to make it better. It's good for kids to have a show like this. I have always enjoyed this show, right from when they kept switching classes with Moze up until they did the last day of school dance through the halls. I always will enjoy this show, no matter what.",2006
10,I like this show a lot! It is a very funny show! Like the one when Cookie kept matching up with the husky! funny. It also gives great tips about school and how to make it better for you. i thought the show at first would be bad because of the LONG name But now i like the show a lot. I watch every time i can. It is one of the best shows on Nick. The actors and actresses act well. The show is NOT confusing. the name is long but good. they have funny and good shows. great you should watch it. i like it a lot. my family likes it a lot too so do my friends too. funny show. i give it a 10 out of 10! so do my friends and family. Good and nice people.,2006
10,this movie is great great plot and it is entertaining and funny i love this show i think it is a classic show i think it should have more seasons because it is so good and i think everybody should watch it and enjoy this great show i am a huge fan of this great show if you don't watch it your missing out go watch it and tell me what you think i believe you will be satisfied with it and think it is funny and entertaining its one of the best shows in the world i am not kidding i am not going overboard i am serious with this show i love it and think it rocks i thought it would suck at first but it is funny and new and never thought of,2013
9,"this is my favorite Nick show! It is so funny! You can laugh when Gordy tries to catch the weasel -who turned out to be a girl, who knew!-, when Cookie makes that face when he gets nervous, when Moze punches Ned, when Ned overreacted when he thought Suzie was going to break up with him, and basically almost every minute!!! To me, the episode, Field Trip, was funny (especially when Gordy destroyed the school door and when Ned told Suzie that he just had to have the Wild Boy skirt- short thing). Although, I wish it would be a little bit more exciting when Moze and Ned finally got together and I don't know, there was something missing! It didn't feel complete to be the ""biggest Ned's Declassified Ever."" And the Alternate Ending was so disappointing! But I know everyone has different thoughts, so if you liked to more than me, OK and if disliked it more than me, OK. Anyway, my main point is, I love this show and I hope Field Trip wasn't the end of it...",2007
9,"I have seen this show many times and I am definitely hooked! This show is funny and keeps your attention the whole time! My little brother and his friends have enjoyed this show since its premiere! I watched an episode with them once and have learned to enjoy them since then! The characters are very funny and enjoyable to watch. Ned Bigby is a smart boy and a good role model for many young boys. Simon ""Cookie"" Cook is half-cyborg so he adds a lot of fun and opportunities to the show. Jennifer ""Moze"" Mosely is the smarter, more sensible one of the group. She provides a lot of the fun of the show too! It is an awesome series and I know it will enjoy future generations for years to come!!",2006

10,"Oh my god, the creator of this show is a genius. Not only are the tips very helpful and true to real life, but its wildly cartoony style is beyond entertaining. I love all of the characters and actors, from the main ones like Ned, Cookie and Moze, to the the recurring ones like Coconut Head, Loomer and Suzie, Even the adults are cool like Gordy, Sweeny or Vice Principle Crubbs. The stereotypical characters make the show all the more funny. I also like how the focus is only on school, and not Ned's home life. The fact that there is a minimal plot to the show is also refreshing. I gave it a 10 out of 10, one of my favorite shows ever.",2009

But if we keep begging for more like they did with 7th. Heaven, maybe the producers will add another season. As soon as I saw the episode when Cookie got a moustache, I knew the show was bound to end soon. All the good Nick is being taken away. First it was the Amanda show, then All That, and now Ned's. Let's hope Drake and Josh isn't next, because that's the only good show on Nick left, besides Spongebob. I'll miss Krubs's weirdness, and his mispronunciation of words, like saying ""Moi"" (me in French) with muy (Spanish for very). I'll miss Mr. Kwest's ""Sh-Sh-Sh-Shwaw,"" and the comb-over guy's comb-over. I thought Cookie was really funny.Point is, I'll really miss this show a lot, but at least there will be reruns, so I can see all the funny episodes again. If you miss it as much as I do, sign the petition to save the show on the Ned's message board.",2007
10,This was a great show as a kid bringing back nostalgic memories. It consists of zany antics and realistic middle school problems made unrealistic and reenacted puerilely. It always makes me laugh with the stupid stunts and the silly sound effects.,2012
9,"Finally...something creative and delightful directed at teens and pre-teens...that parents could enjoy too. After having my teeth hurt from the over-doses of fake sweetness from the same fakeness on the Disney Channel and the other Nick shows...this onefactually is fun to watch..and it makes you understand just what some kids go through in school...stuff you probably forget about after you grow up. The main character...Ned...is an average kid...who is trying to navigate through Jr. high school...with two of his good frieds...Cookie and Moze. One is a nerd and the other is a girl who seems to excell at almost everything..but is always humble with her friends. They get into all kinds of mischief together during the school hours. Since teens live a good part of their lives at school...this makes sense. It is their universe...and it is bringing them closer to being OMG...responsible adults someday...if they make it past the bullies, weird teachers and rather strange principal who is stuck in a 80s' fashion warp...sun glasses and all. They try to fit in as much as they can...but try to be themselves at the same time. It goes to show you even teens have issues that screw with the way their lives are going. There should be more shows like this one offered to teens on television instead of the over kill of fake grins and ""perfect"" teens that are the usual fare on other channels. Bravo Ned and company.",2010
8,I have always like this show. It is more what school looks like from the perspective of an imaginative group of students rather than reality. The first episode I ever saw had cookie portrayed by a slightly chubby white kid and Moze was a blonde. I always assumed that was a pilot episode with actors that didn't work out. If I ever come across the show browsing the channels I have I will always watch it,2017
1,"And just to make sure you get it right, i'll repeat myself: Watch the french original! It's so much better, starting from the cast (Queen Latifah is so miscast, it hurts), straight to the story/humor (it's just not right)! ",2007
1,"Like Roger Ebert once stated about a movie, I'll use his words to state this one: (This movie)isn't even the bottom of the barrel, it doesn't even scrape the bottom of barrel. It doesn't even deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence as barrels. When you have a movie where Queen Latifah is the most experienced actor in the film, you know you are in trouble.The debut appearances of Giselle and Jimmy were awful. They did not get into character and made no connection between the the audience and the movie. It surprised me that such amateur actors in the movie business (jimmy is quite good in Saturday night live) were given such large roles. Also, the whole plot was ludicrous. Brazilian supermodels robbing a bank? In New York? Yeah, right. BS. Still wanna watch this movie? Watch it at your own risk!",2006
3,This is the American version of the French Taxi films and it suffers in comparison.,2004
1,"Avoid this film at all costs! This is just a very very cheap remake of the french movie by the same name. Being a big fan of that Taxi, I was intrigued to see what the Yanks had done with it. Watching it was painful, the only reason I watched till the end was to see how low they were going to go with this film. ",2006
1,"My God. Having watched all of the three french prequels I have to say I was a bit skeptical right from the start, but this is pure madness. Being able to shred such a great movie as ""Taxi"" into this horrible excuse for a film is beyond me. There are no humor, no story, no acting and no action. It lacks everything you want from this types of films. I have to say that if you were able to see the whole movie in 5 minutes, it wouldn't be worth the time. If you're thinking of seeing this movie and haven't seen the french one, please, do yourself a favor. See the original.",2005
4,"Slick, flashy film, a semi-remake of Luc Besson's ""Taxi"" from 1998, here Americanized as an urban action-comedy. Queen Latifah plays smart-mouthed cabbie with a souped-up vehicle in New York City who inadvertently partners with stumble bum cop Jimmy Fallon to crack a major crime case. Film should have relied more on Latifah's natural sass and less on Fallon's white-bread, dim-witted act (race is a constant punchline in the script, and Fallon is just there as Exhibit A). Jennifer Esposito is wonderful as a no-nonsense police lieutenant, Ann-Margret is a stitch as Fallon's tippling mother, and John Sierros (Broadway actor shamefully credited as 'Fat Cop') shines as a bamboozled police officer, but what happened to Queen Latifah? She gets a few good cracks in, but there's no character here for her to play; she sticks to her sarcastic persona and puts everyone down, but her role is depressingly one-dimensional. Comedy has a fast pace, impressive cinematography (although the swooping crane shots in traffic get repetitive) and some good car chases, but the screenplay needed an overhaul. ** from ****",2005

1,"YES! This movie is a re-make of an original french movie Taxi, in case you didn't know and a pretty bad one.

7,"Come on, guys, this movie wasn't so terrible! There's no point comparing it to Besson's first two Taxi films because that's not what it's about - sure, 8 out of 10 of its content is straight from the other movies but just get past that and it's a not bad, quite sweet, sometimes funny, car-chase romp. Fallon and Latifah work pretty well on screen and the script's fairly lively. OK, the plot may be contrived and obvious but it's still worth a watch. Too many reviews on here are written by people comparing everything to past film moments - just because Star Wars was (alledgely) a great Sci-Fi movie, doesn't mean that every Sci-Fi afterwards isn't worth watching. So don't write this one off straight away - just don't take it too seriously and watch it on a lazy, rainy Saturday afternoon.",2007
4,"TAXI is the American remake of the quirky 1998 Luc Besson comedy. While the core of the film is still oriented around fast cars, hot chicks and zany humour, the film's light-hearted French comedic ambiance has been replaced with a dirtier, more strident, and somewhat more serious American action-comedy feel, which, although it tries hard, doesn't quite translate as it should. Queen Latifah leads as Belle Williams, a taxi driver who runs a souped-up Ford around the meaner streets of the city. Jimmy Fallon plays the unco New York cop who lands in her cab one day in pursuit of a bunch of foxy Brazilian bank robbers. Together, they muddle through car-crashes, shoot-outs and weirdly-decorated apartments to bring crooks to justice. While the plot sounds like a good premise for a decent comedy, the film is sorely lacking in script composition. The one-liners are crap, the jokes feel forced, and the script, which alternates between taking itself too seriously and sheer stupidity, does no justice whatsoever to the energetic and talented cast. A major disappointment from what looked to be a brilliant film. Someone should remake it in six more years - with a little more skill, I hope.",2004
8,"This is a VERY funny movie. It leaves you laughing out loud throughout. It has comedy (loads of it), action, racing, crime and a little bit of romance! Perfect mixture! Both girls and guys will love it!! Queen Latifah is her usual jolly smart-aleck self while Andy (Jimmy Fallon) steals the show with his endearing performance leaving you clutching your stomach with laughter!!! His idiocy and geeky look while the thieves are really HOT! At first I thought it was going to be boring but with the Queen in it, I expected some jokes at least. But what I got was one helluva ""party"" time. The movie moves fast and you get quite hooked onto it. When you feel you want more, the credits roll on.. The scriptwriter has done a great job with the dialogues. There was no much ingenuity in the whole thing but well, a movie is a movie. Thats it. And you just watch it to take your mind off stuff, laugh for awhile and relax. Taxi gives you that. It is very recently that I came to know that there were more movies whose title is ""TAXI"" but I have not watched them. SO, for me, this movie was good.",2008
7,"When first seeing the trailers for this film, and people saying how good it was I immediately touted that this would be Jimmy Fallon's breakout into mainstream. It would be what Beverly Hills Cop was for Murphy. I did think Fallon could pull it off. It was only fortunate for director Tim Story that his direction and a strong supporting cast saved this film from the crap it could have been.",2005
9,"This film is entertaining and a good popcorn movie. There some rough parts in this movie, but the Queen came to the rescue always. You can tell that this script came from the mind of Luc Besson the creator of the 5th Element. I would have liked to see the film stay to the original instead of the watered down rewrite. The comedy was sometimes over the top but the Queen helped it work. Good movie to be entertained with beautiful men and women, the car chases and sexual tension. 9 more the entertainment value. If you approach this movie with anything else than wanting to be taken for a fun taxi ride with the Queen do see it. But if you do what this taken for ride, by all means do.",2005
6,"A stupid detective that is not a good driver uses a terrific taxi driver, who dreams to be a pilot of racing car, to chase four bank robbers in a BMW. With this simple story line, ""Taxi"" is a very silly movie, but I laughed a lot. The greatest attraction for me was certainly the debut of the Brazilian top model Gisele Bündchen as ""actress"". But indeed Queen Latifah and Jimmy Fallon carry this dumb, ridiculous and absurd story in a very funny way. Another funny situation for the Brazilian viewers is to hear Ana Cristina de Oliveira speaking Portuguese with a strong accent from Portugal as if she were Brazilian. I laughed a lot with her pronunciation in Portuguese, which sounds very funny for us. I totally disagree with comments like ""the worst movie ever made"", probably made by persons without sense of humor as commented by another IMDb user. ""Austin Powers"" movies, just as an example, are dumber and less funny than ""Taxi"". If the viewer does not have much expectation about this film, he or she may probably have a good time. My vote is six.",2005
10,"After five years of waiting, Belle Williams (Queen Latifah) is finally getting her hack license, and New York City had better watch out, because she makes the typical New York cabbie look like a driver's ed poster child. At the same time, Washburn (Jimmy Fallon), a bumbling New York City policeman, has just had his license taken away after totaling his third police car. When Washburn hears of a nearby bank robbery over his radio while walking a beat, he commandeers Belle's cab, and a new, extremely reckless partnership is born.",2005
7,"I don't know what you guys are talking about.... This was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. If you're in the mood for a good laugh... then you HAVE to see this one!! Jimmy Fallon did a great job as the worst cop in history... and Queen Latifah was wicked funny!!! I nearly split my gut when Jimmy was trying to get out of his parking space with his mothers car!! Jeez... I can't even count the amount of times I cracked up laughing... my neighbors must have thought I was going crazy or something!!! Belle's boyfriend was H-O-T!! Made me want to be ""Queen"" for a day... that's for sure!!! I just think anyone that didn't like this movie is wound way to tight... it clearly was one of the films that you don't need to think about... just sit back and have a good laugh... it's what it's all about!!! Life is too short, after all... jeez.... get a grip!!",2005
8,"I thought this movie was so funny... A movie where the guys are girls... and the woman are seen playing roles and jobs where usually only men play them. The movie is fast and funny, ""The fast and furious"" mixed with a bit of ""Bringing down the house"". An interesting view at how people from totally different backgrounds meet in a situation that brings them together and they grow a friendship and help each other out to become better people in themselves. Washburn can drive now, and Williams gets to race, something she only dreamt of, and worked her whole life for. Sexy women as the bad ""guys"", a cab driver acting like a cop, a women as a lieutenant, and a man who shouldn't even be a cop, let alone have his license, an interesting combination to create one hell of a movie!",2005
7,Taxi is the type of movie that I usually stay away from. I thought this would be a weak comedy but I laughed at quite a few scenes. This movie is not perfect by any means. This is just a movie to get cheap laughs out of.,2011

One day, she meet Andy who is policeman. He is rude but he pursue criminals with Belle. The criminals are beautiful females, but they drive a car at top speed too! So, the car chase happened.",2008
7,"I give it 7/10 because I think it is funny and give me joyous moments. Though the storyline is simple, there is no lack of exciting scenes. The car-chasing is good. Some say that the acting is bad, but I think the actor have played their role dutifully. ",2008
10,"This movie is hilarious. And is free of foul language making it a movie the whole family can watch. Jimmy Fallon has such a lovable comic sense and it shows through his character. Though predictable at times, this is a movie that you can watch when you just want to sit down and laugh. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for something lighthearted and fun to watch. For being Fallon's movie debut he did a great job, so if you loved Fallon on Saturday night live, you will love this movie. Latifa also does a great job, and complemented Fallon very well, the contrast between the two characters was done very well, which in turn created some great comical moments. So to any Fallon and Latifa fans this is a great movie to watch.",2009

9,"Kung Fu Hustle was one of the most visually imaginative and unique movies I have seen in quite some time. Upon first viewing the trailer, I thought we would have another Kung Pow: Enter The Fist on our hands but, boy, was I wrong. Unlike Kung Pow, the jokes did not grow tired on me and the special effects were definitely top notch. The scene with the two assassins playing that stringed instrument (don't know the name of it) in such a way that it kills was incredible.",2005
10,"Goodness me, what a fantastic movie. Caught the world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival and the entire theater laughed until they cried. Amazingly directed, HILARIOUSLY funny, it blends a 1930s gangster stylishness into a Hong Kong kung fu movie to astonishing results. Who would've thought you could top Shaolin Soccer? Not me, until I saw this movie. Stephen Chow pulled it off. Chow's comedic timing gets better and better with every movie he makes, and while his films are depending more and more on CGI these days, and makes this movie much more a fantasy kung fu film than a traditional one, it hardly detracts from the enjoyable experience. Make it your mission to see this film - it will be one of the most entertaining you ever see. I can't remember the last film I enjoyed myself in more. My eyes still hurt from wiping away tears of laughter. Seriously.",2004
9,Before we went to see this movie we had heard about many good reviews of it. After spending approximate 100mins in the movie theater we were extremely satisfied and entertained. This movie is even better than we have expected. There were full of laughters almost from the beginning to the end in the theater. ,2004
10,"In general, it's a movie which puts tribute to all the Kung Fu Movie.",2004
10,"After nearly two decades of avoiding kung fu movies, a copy of this one was pressed into my hands by a very dear friend... who then extracted a promise from me that I'd take the time that night to sit and watch it. I was less than enthusiastic when I tossed it into the drive of my Athlon, but a promise is a promise, after all. Five minutes later, a nuclear strike warning in my town couldn't have torn me away from the screen, and it's been watched a dozen times since.",2005

Stumbling across a gang-controlled apartment to extort money from the locals who are actually kung fu masters in disguise. Sing's actions attracts the notorious Axe Gang, and set off a relentless chain of events that brings the clans together in an explosive battle.",2005
9,"I liked Shaolin Soccer, it was full of laughs and Stephen Chow has done it again with Kung Fu Hustle. It's not in the same vein as Shaolin Soccer and it is not a belly full of laughs, but it certainly emphasised his love of action movies especially Martial Art movies. The film pays homage to all those Hong Kong Martial Arts Serials, Bruce Lee and the action genre in general. I would even say that Kung Fu Hustle is a more refined Shoalin Soccer in terms of storyline, action sequences and acting.",2005
10,"I saw this movie yesterday and it is definitely one of the best movies that was made in the history of Hong Kong. The plot itself is simple, and the storyline is all about kung fu. Yet, it is not just a funny comedy about kung fu. It is more than that. Somehow it is similar to Harry Potter (in this case is wizard) or animations by Hayao Miyazaki in which a world of imagination is created. The characters in the film are so funny and classic. Most of them appeared in some of Stephen Chow's movies before but because the context of every movie is different, the overall result is hilarious. This is a movie that make Hong Kong people proud. I hope it will be a box office success in other countries too. I think I'll definitely buy the movie DVD for my personal collection.",2004
10,"I don't know where to start with this movie. My expectations were blown away. In fact, I wasn't sure what to expect. But let me tell you that the experience was worth more than my disgustingly overpriced admission. With the popcorn and drink on top of it.",2005
10,In my opinion this is the best Chinese comedy kung fu movie yet to be made. I'm not very familiar with the previous work of the director Stephen Chow except for Shaolin Soccer but this flick has everything to entertain any movie fan.,2006
8,"Being a complete sourpuss when it comes to most comedic film offerings from the last three decades (though I attribute a lot of that to inanity rather than taking full credit for being a wet blanket), I find that when there is a film that makes me laugh so hard that I am concerned about the possibility of a stroke, I have no choice but to rave about it. So having said that, consider this a rave review of Stephen Chow's ""Kung Fu Hustle"".",2005
10,"I gave this movie a ""10"" because I just thoroughly enjoyed this movie! I won't go into details about the story because there are plenty of other comments that do that. What I will say is that even though I read a couple of good reviews about this movie, I wasn't prepared for what a wonderful experience sitting through this movie would give me. While the plot was fairly simple and it was definitely an action film, there were just so many things that surprised me throughout the movie. There were times in the film where I had to applaud - it was such a ""feel good"" movie and I left the theater with the same HUGE smile on my face that was on my face for about 90% of the movie.",2005
10,"A dream of a kid? Remember the bum who sell manuals? If the story about Sing really happens, bum shall be some 20 years older than he first showed up when Sing was a small kid. But at the ending part, he looks the same age with before, trying to sell some ""more powerful"" kung fu manuals. There may be other explanations, but to read this part in a real-life way, it means he is the one who is selling dream manuals, and Sing is just like normal people who just bought one and then,made a dream.",2005
9,"Hi all, I started watching Kung-fu hustle out of sheer boredom on my flight to Japan. I expected it to be another boring martial arts movie with clichéd story lines and bad acting. What I found was an amazingly entertaining, crazy, novel story with slap-stick comedy that had me laughing my *ss off loud. Stephen Chow is definitely putting China on the world cinema map with his genre of movies. The action is of course not real and has used computer effects - but I don't believe Chow is trying impress everyone just by having real martial arts a la Ongbak. He is an entertainer like Jackie Chan was in his prime. He even takes a cheeky punt at western movies like the Matrix and Spider-man which is pretty cool. The story of Kung-fu hustle itself is set in a sort of 70's China and people like me who love travelling and different cultures get a real feel of being in China. The story throws up a lot of crazy surprises like that of a children's fairy tale and is very funny and refreshing. I watched Kung-fu hustle a few times now and bought it on DVD and cant wait for his next movie. Kung-fu hustle gets a well deserved 9/10",2005
10,I have mostly good things to say about Stephen Chow's latest movie.,2005
10,"This movie had me wondering much. It was stupid and random yet it spoke to me in such a strange way. It was incredibly mixed up and it worked very well. It's probably one of the most original pieces of movie art I've ever layed my eyes on. Though I was very optimistic in the first place. I didn't really doubt it. But, I still didn't know what to expect. What I got was a totally unpredictable ""drama"" comedy. I also have to give credit to a Chinese director making this great piece of work. No offense to other Chinese directors. I have seen many varieties of great stuff from the orient. But, absolutely nothing like this. Great action. Completely original. Somewhat beautiful. I give it ****** out of ******",2006
10,"There is no score high enough for this... except Stephen Chow is a Kung Fu Director/Writer/Producer GENIUS! Mr. Chow does for movies what Jimi Hendrix did for guitars... My guess is that all Hollywood directors are saying ""you can do that?!?""",2005
10,"Move over Jackie Chan, Stephen Chow is in town. Yes, he is good and way more humorous than Jackie ""I wish I was funny"" Chan. The truth is that Jackie Chan tries to look too adorable in his action flicks. He never suffers the way the hero in KUNG FU SHUFFLE did. Yes, this movie delivered ALL the good on all cylinders. I liked that mean dude who turned into a bull frog a lot. That was intense. And when he punched the dude in the face super hard and made his face go into the ground? That was just plain SICK! Also, that lady with the hair curlers was awesome. At first she seemed mean, but then we learn different. How did she become so powerful?",2005
10,"This movie has everything--comedy, drama, pathos, incredible action, slapstick, great acting, a great story, wildly inventive absurdity, actual thematic threads (a long gone element in US films), moments of sheer poetry, and genuine heart. In true HK style, it has a bit of everything. Not only was it a much, much better martial arts film than either the more respected ""Hero"" or ""House of Flying Daggers,"" it was a much better film, period. In fact, ""Kung Fu Hustle"" was one of the best movies of any kind I've seen this year.",2005
8,This film is freaking hilarious! I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard. Afterwards I wanted to tell people how funny it was but every time I tried I would start laughing again simply from thinking about it. Stephen Chow is incredibly funny and talented. Its hard to write why the film is funny without spoiling it but I'll give it my best shot because Kong Fu Hustle deserves to be seen without having any preconceived notions about it.,2005
10,This movie is a highly creative and stylized action film from the Hong Kong kung fu genre.,2005
10,"I did not know what to expect of this movie other than what the trailer showed, but I was completely blown away by this film! Not only does it pay homage to the Matrix and Spiderman as well as Looney Tune cartoons but the opening with the butterfly paid homage to the Men In Black with the dragonfly flying through the opening credits. From that point on, I was totally swept up in the movie and the 95 or so minutes seemed to go by in no time at all! The effects were well within the atmosphere presented by this action/comedy and I found myself laughing at all the jokes presented as well as feeling for the character of Sing as he blundered his way through trying to be a gangster even though he was way in over his head.",2005
10,"""Six Shooter"" is the debut written/directed film by playwright Martin McDonagh and now I want to see more of his work.",2006
7,"McDonagh is a brilliant story teller and fully deserves his Tony nominations and his Olivier Award for Best Play (The Pillowman). His critics have questioned his use of casual cruelty as a dramatic device, although he always grounds violence in a social context or connects sadism to particular characters' proclivities. This film is beautifully acted by Brendon Gleeson and especially Rúaidhrí Conroy, sharply photographed, and well directed by McDonagh himself. For technique alone it is Oscar-worthy. But the whole piece strikes me as an absurdist joke with insufficient resonance. This is a mélange of destructions, an indulgence in violence that reduces and parodies McDonagh's better scripts.",2006
10,"As far as short films go, this is near the top of the list. McDonagh (formerly a playwright, here making his film debut) is a master craftsman, able to play several levels at the same time. ""Six Shooter"" is shocking, heartbreaking and very funny, often simultaneously. The story, in a nutshell, revolves around four people, each suffering a very recent death in their families. As they each deal with the loss in very different ways, they collide with each other, sometimes with words, sometimes with more.",2006
10,"They showed this on RTE television recently and I watched out of curiosity, it turned out to be much better than expected... Fantastic acting, superb casting and a fabulously brilliant and disturbing story. It's great to see the quality of Irish short films returning to something worthy of an Oscar nomination compared to some of the nonsense perpetrated throughout the past couple of years. Martin Mc Donagh is a quality playwright and this first foray into the world of movie making is a wonderful success to say the least. It's also fantastic to see the raw talent of Ruaidhri Conroy back on screen and with none other than Brendan Gleeson, the master! It's entirely deserving of it's Oscar nomination, fingers crossed for the lads. Thoroughly recommended!!!!",2006
6,"Your appreciation of SIX SHOOTER, a 30 minute Irish short by IN BRUGES director Martin McDonagh, largely depends on your tolerance for black comedy. I thought myself a fan of it, but after some of the subject matter played for laughs here - including cot death - I'm not so sure. Much of the material left me cold.",2012
8,"I just found this flicking through channels and it turned out to be pretty good. seeing Brendan Gleeson kept my attention for the first few minutes, but the story is pretty shocking stuff. I liked the camera-work on the train which, despite it being filmed on a small Irish train carriage) doesn't make it feel cramped. The boys character in it is great. Even though i like Gleeson, it's Ruadhri Conroy's character that kept me watching more than anyone else. It manages to pack in a fair few unexpected turns into its half hour length, and some of it made me surprised it was aired at all. The only other guy i recognized (of the cast of about 5) was David Wilmot from intermission. Anyway for a debut this is very good and it's worth seeing. Hopefully he'll be doing something else soon",2006
8,"First thing I have got to say, is that I am a huge fan of Martin McDonaghs stage plays. Six-Shooter tells the tale of a recently bereaved man who finds himself in the same carriage as a mourning couple and a young psycho. The next half an hour presents all McDonaghs famous trademarks which have made him the the toast of the Theatre world.",2006
7,"Finally saw this online and wondering what all the fuss is about. Almost whimsical, I couldn't quite believe the darkness at the centre of the story. There are a couple of good lines and the performances are solid  Rory Conroy being the best. Martin McDonagh is a very talented playwright, but on this evidence his directing is a little flat. Film looks and sounds flat too. What struck me about it was the superficiality of it all, the cynicism. However it does have some funny moments and moves along at a brisk pace. I'm not surprised it was looked on so favourably by the academy, picking up an Oscar for Best Short Film  it has hip written all over it. And it is one of the better short Irish films I've seen, complete with twists and double twists and a lot of flippant dialogue. McDonagh is planning a gangster film with Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson. I'll pay money to see that. He obviously wants to be the Celtic Scorsese. High point a cow explodes. Low point rather tasteless plot line about a baby's death. Brendan Gleeson is in this film.",2007
7,"The London-born playwright of Irish parents,Martin McDonagh,returns to the land of his fathers for his movie debut,and shows considerable promise and talent as a filmmaker.The film has an excellent performance from the well-known Brendan Gleeson and an even better one from the relatively unknown Ruaiduri Conroy as the main protagonists.As with all black comedy,it is mainly about the subject of death and it's various causes and impacts it has on various individuals.The potential poor taste the story offers is easily offset by fine photography,a witty script,convincing characterisation and well executed plot twists.The foul language could be too much for some,but it is to be hoped that on this showing at least,McDonagh will concentrate on film-making in the future equally as much as his theatre work.",2006
10,"This is one of admittedly few short films that I have seen. I purchased this through the iTunes music store, and I must say, it was very worth the $1.99. This is a story of a man whose wife died, and gets on a train and sits down next to one of the few people on the train. It is a very simple storyline, yet the developments that result make this film truly an excellent piece of film (hence the Oscar). Personally, I would consider this to be a comedy, but it is of the dark and twisted variety. Anyone who wants a moving, yet humorous short film should most certainly find a way to watch this. Highly recommended due to the artful combination of humor and true content, while still providing an appealing and interesting story.",2006
5,"SIX SHOOTER was an infuriating film for me, though judging by the fact that it won the Oscar for Best Live Action Short, I assume I must be in the minority. What I found infuriating was that the film seemed so uneven and didn't seem to stay within a genre. One minute, it was a very sad drama, the next it was a bit of a comedy and back and forth it went. I've seen others describe it as a black comedy but there just wasn't enough to laugh at or enough irony for me to see it as this style film. I like my humor dark, but this just wasn't even funny--it was just rather nihilistic.",2008
5,"So this was nominated for and won the Academy Award for Live Action Short Film. So intriguing how they done it. Many spend a fortune to get one of those little Oscars, so what was so good about this low budget short movie? We have here 30 mins of mostly three sets of people with some tragedy in their lives which they reveal in one way or the others.",2015

After not one but two extraordinary experiences on the train Donnelly arrives home intent on committing suicide. He starts by shooting his wife's beloved pet rabbit first.,2009
7,"After seeing 'In Bruges', I got curious of the other film Martin McDonagh had made. This short film is also a dark comedy and tries to make fun of death, suicide and the loss of a loved one. This is of course really hard and not easy to do. It sometimes fails as well at some points, but overall it kinda succeeds. ",2011
6,I am a big fan of In Bruge by director Martin McDonagh. I happened to catch this short after the screening of In Bruge yesterday on Film4. I was looking forward to watch this short and it certainly did not disappoint.,2010
7,"A bit of fun for the black-hearted, very black-hearted. Death becomes them, all of them it seems, in one way or another. I am a fan of dark humor myself--Sweeney Todd and League of Gentlemen come to mind--but despite having a reasonably strong stomach, this film made me uncomfortable. Make no mistake, it is wonderfully crafted, with outstanding performances, top-notch production values, and a glorious punch line, but it might be a trial to keep your eyes on the screen until the final payoff.",2006
7,"I wanted to see this film because another movie directed and written by Martin McDonagh, In Bruges. That was one of those rare films that I rate highest and therefore I had to see this one.",2009
10,"Morose middle-aged Donnelly (a typically terrific performance by the always great Brendan Gleeson) takes a long and grueling train ride home following the tragic sudden death of his wife. Donnelly encounters both a young couple whose baby has just passed away and a brash, rowdy, irrepressibly snotty punk kid (splendidly played with deliciously malicious glee and gusto by Ruaidhri Conroy) who antagonizes his fellow hapless passengers with his incessant coarse language and blithely rude, callous and offensive behavior. Writer/director Martin McDonagh, an acclaimed Irish playwright, deftly mines a fresh, startling and often uproariously twisted line in black-as-coal gallows humor in this offbeat and inspired meditation on death, grief and loss. This is hardcore merrily macabre black humor that's as dark as the best chocolate and every bit as tasty (the exploding cow gag is especially gut-busting!). Moreover, the performances are across-the-board fantastic (Conroy in particular is simply amazing), the photography of the lush Irish countryside is breathtakingly beautiful, and the story offers a wondrous wealth of delightfully warped and shocking surprises. Overall, this stupendous Oscar-winning short film qualifies as 30 sublimely nasty and frequently flat-out sidesplitting minutes worth of pure black comedy gold.",2006
8,"I quite enjoyed the director's two feature films ""In Bruges"" and ""Seven Psychopaths"", so why not give his Oscar-winning short film a chance. I watched Wes Anderson's very first film starring the Wilson Brothers recently and was slightly disappointed, not so by this one. Not at all.",2013
8,"Martin McDonagh is a very unorthodox director, his very Irish dark sense of humor comes across strongly throughout his films. This has often lead to them having mixed reviews on account of the fact that people judge them to be exploiting violence. Indeed McDonaghs works often contain controversial themes and content. This particularly comes across in his litary works (for example the pillow man). McDonagues theatrical influence comes across strongly in Six Shooter.It manages to successfully make use of a very simple dark plot with not a hint of cliché or Hollywood improbability.The film manages to coherently string together a strong and conclusive story through its short running time without noticeably rushing character development or background. Six shooter generally maintains a somber mood which is occasional punctuated with spectacularly funny sequences. This creates a sense on contrast that pervades the work. And leads the audience to develop a sense of uncertainty throughout the film. Brendon Gleeson and Ruhadari Conroy both perform to perfection and feel completely at home it the films potentially claustrophobic setting. In conclusion this is a superb and bizarre film which will both amuse and shock you in a way that very few modern shorts can.",2011

10,"I have watched almost every show of this series and I LOVED it!! Seeing Robert Vaughn has been a treat (I am old enough to remember him in the Man from Uncle), and Adrian Lester is spot on for this role. Every show I am waiting to see who they will con, usually bad guys, and how it goes. The show is cleverly written, well acted and directed. It is not typical by any means. Not something you can multitask and watch either since they have twists and turns in it you do NOT want to miss. I like the addition of the brother and sister following losing the first gal (who was also brilliant)...but bringing in the newbies and showing them the ropes was cool. Also, if you watch the series and get to know the cast, be SURE to watch the last show at the end, it is SUPER. I will miss this show, glad for reruns, for sure! Good job cast!!",2014
10,"Hustle is one of the best TV shows that exists at this time. Its an honest opinion from someone who have seen 24, Homeland, Chuck, Prison break,Sherlock and many more. However, each TV series has its pros and cons. But in this show you can find absolute fun and not a boring moment. You will love Marc Warren without any hesitation. I have seen 3 seasons in a row and missing Adrian Lester and I don't know why he is not in the show. This TV series has wit, lots and lots of tricks, a whole bunch of teasing which anyone will find absolutely hilarious. Robert Vaughn gets loads of respect for his presence in the show. He plays the big daddy who has experience in conning almost anyone. Glenister is dazzling as a technical genius and the truth is whatever he is expected to do in the TV series is believable. He not only does the computer, he has to act and react to convince. Jamie is like a filler in each episode and later I believe she has gained a reputation of being very important. This show reminds me Oceans movie big time. Its my second British TV series and I have become a fan of their accent. If you haven't seen it, just take a ride with the first episode. Trust me, every one loves a great con.",2012

10,"The first time I watched Hustle I was hooked. I love how everything comes together at the end, and how the picture freezes and the characters talk to one another or to the audience. Sometimes the characters look directly at the audience so you feel that you are a part of the picture. It is so refreshing.",2006
10,"I think the one mediocre season people are referring to may well be the one when Adrian Lester took a break and Ashley Walters stepped in as Billy Bond for that season. I personally never took to him as a character but then in fairness to him, Mickey ""Bricks"" Stone was a tough act to follow both character and actor. Maybe they are referring to the first series without Danny and Stacie (Marc Warren and Jaime Murray) who were also very hard acts to follow. Again I never quite warmed to Emma and Sean Kennedy (Kelly Adams and Matt Di Angelo) although she was very VERY easy on the eyes. Not as easy as Jamie but easy nevertheless.",2012
10,"Hustle had me drawn in from Series 1 right up until the very last episode of Series 8, It's one of the very few shows that hasn't had an episode that i didn't like. Very few TV shows on at the moment has gave me that feeling.",2012
10,"Well, BBC Entertainment finally got this series to India. Its probably the best crime drama i've ever seen. Classy and Slick makes you feel like you should be one of em. The music is awesome, shots, color grading, everything is EXCELLENT. Saw two episodes and ordered the DVDs from Amazon. Do not miss this. If you've not even seen on episode, buy the whole DVD set. God I'm a fan...... Absolutely love it.....",2007

10,"Recently viewed this TV Series and enjoyed the great acting and story about a bunch of con-artists who are extremely smart to the point they actually out smart themselves. Veteran actor Robert Vaughn does a fantastic job of acting and his facial expressions are the true characteristics of a silver fox Con. The professional cons are always willing to let newcomers into their group and sometimes these newcomers give them a run for their money in more ways than one. The gals are very sexy looking and in this TV Series, the gals do most of the background work and play rather low key roles. This is a great show and in many ways, these con-artists are only doing what most big business perform on a daily basis.",2006
7,"but when it is bad it is trite, clichéd, and reminiscent of something better. I enjoy this show. The characters are fun, the twists are (usually) good. When it is at its best, you never see the turns coming. You get inspired and might even want to try a con yourself. I love the way the characters wink at us, the observers. I like the interactions and the relationships that they have built. But occasionally I watch and I know that I have seen this con before, in some movie or book, where it was done better. And occasionally the writers have tried so hard to come up with a surprise twist that you cannot help but see it a mile away.",2006
8,"This is one of the few movies that you will either love or hate. There is no middle ground. The people that have slammed this movie must not have understood a lot of the symbolism.

9,"This captivating thriller, based on a novella (Secret Window, Secret Garden) by Stephen King, is a true stroke of movie genius. Many reviews, make the claims that this movie is ""outworn"", ""cliched"" and even ""predictable""! With these claims, I strongly disagree. The writing for this film is incredibly clever and complicated, I myself had to watch the film 2 or 3 times before I could fully comprehend all of the twists and turns that are interwoven throughout. Not a film for the faint hearted - although the majority of the violence is only implied - there are a few gory scenes, which all include a screw driver and a lot of blood. Despite how this may sound, this is not a ""full on gore movie"" by any means. Quite the opposite, it is a very deep psychological thriller which will leave you with a lot to think about. A truly moving performance by Johnny Depp, who plays the role of Mort outstandingly, so that you can really connect with Mort, and empathize with how he is feeling. John Turturro, another incredible actor, plays Shooter with a real eeriness,with the perfect amount of emotion and madness. A truly fantastic film, which will leave you jaw dropped (no exaggeration) by the time you reach the end. Plus Johnny Depp is gorgeous as Mort Rainey, and that can't be bad ;)",2005
7,"The second novella to be adapted from the Stephen King compilation ""Four Past Midnight,"" SECRET WINDOW is one of King's adapted stories that while not being great or especially memorable, somehow manages to tell its premise quite chillingly while maintaining itself closer to B-movie status and (equally) true to its dark core.",2005
8,"I've seen psychological thriller's that try to scare you more than melt your brain, this one I'm proud to say does both. It's a very, very malicious and haunting thrill machine. I t brings the very essence of how horror and Psycho thriller's are suppose to be done, not with over the top gore and CGI, but with old school conventional means.",2009
5,"Secret Window: 5 out of 10: I am not going to critique Johnny Depp. He is fine in this movie. And I certainly do not want the great wrath of woman, of various ages, down upon my head. Johnny Depp is a thespian God. He can do no wrong. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory never existed... (God he was awful in that.) Depp’s performance is the most entertaining thing is Secret Window. In fact with the exception of a wonderfully drawn Timothy Hutton in a supporting role, it is the only entertaining thing in the movie. The small cast is rounded out by Maria Bello (A 41 year old butterface that plays Depp’s, cuckolding, bitchy, soon to be ex-wife) and the usually dependable John Turturro who is a disaster.",2008
6,"Director David Koepp has written some nice screenplays ('Carlito's Way', 'Panic Room') and I liked his 'Stir of Echoes'. Here he comes with a thriller based on a Stephen King novel that is not very good but has some qualities. The best quality here is another terrific performance from Johnny Depp. No matter what he does, he succeeds in making a film entertaining even when it should not be.",2005
10,"I have always wanted to see Secret Window; when a movie has such varied and mixed reviews it is always intriguing to see the movie itself and find out which side of the line you sit on. I recently viewed Secret Window with a friend from the safety of my own home. It's only a short movie, which in itself has appeal, and if it were any longer the suspense element would have most definitely fizzled away. The first hour or so nothing much happens, the story line just plods along and you wait and watch to look for anything you have missed and wonder whether the story is going to go anywhere. The first portion of the movie is not a complete failure, however, as Johnny Depp once again shines in his role and keeps the viewer somewhat interested. Once the twist kicks in, the movie takes the viewer to a whole new level. My friend and I were simply intrigued in horror. It simply is brilliant and I would recommend this to anyone who loves being taken on a journey through their imagination.",2005
9,"though it is a very different movie than both of those.still,i liked everything about it.it's suspenseful,thrilling and unpredictable.plus,Johnny Depp gives a masterful performance,in my opinion.the supporting cast is also great.John Turturro,Maria Bello,Timothy Hutton and Charles S.Dutton all put in great performances.i have only seen a handful of Stephen King adaptations,but probably half of those have been unimpressive to me.like most king movies,this one has its weirdness.nothing is straightforward or as it seems.but i felt this one had a bit more depth of character and story,which is refreshing.there are a few twists and turns and some red herrings to lead you in the wrong direction.i was kept guessing to the very end. i thought this movie was great,though like i said i didn't like it quite as much as two previous King adaptations,such as The Shawshank redemption and The Green Mile,which are masterpieces,in my opinion.still,Secret Window is a right up there.for me,Secret Window is a 9/10",2008
5,"Secret Window shows that a bunch of good actors (Depp and Torturro) combined with a script by Stephen King don't lead to good entertainment. The problem is that the storyline doesn't work. This film seems to be a combination of ""The Shining"" and ""Misery"" but it isn't nearly as enthralling as those two. Also, the introduction of the schizophrenic alter ego is becoming a bit threadbare. That theme has been explored enough in films like ""Psycho"" or ""Fight Club"" etc. An additional problem is the characters. No one of those seems to be able to inspire a bit of sympathy. Nevertheless, the final scene may be just original enough to rate it 5 out of ten instead of 4.",2009
6,"When I first heard that this film was in production, I was frankly very surprised. I have read all of Steve King's work, and ""Secret Window, Secret Garden"" was never something I felt would make an easy film adaptation. I was even more surprised to hear that Johnny Depp - an actor who rarely mis-steps - was signed for the lead. Now, add both Depp and John Turturro doing deep-south accents, and I'm afraid, you've just disappeared into a mirror through which I could never pass. Yet, here it is. And somehow, they all pull it off. Secret Window is a fairly well made and entertaining shocker, with some amazingly creepy and bizarre performances by Depp and Turturro, and some good eerie camera work and sound. That said, I will cut right to the chase - THIS IS NOT A FEEL-GOOD FILM - so don't come to it looking for straightforward fun, comedy or a happy-go-lucky story. This is hardcore Stephen King, and does not necessarily let anybody off the hook. As with many of the film adaptations of Steve King, this is a film best seen AFTER you read the original work. This film, like so many others, lacks the depth, detail and richness of King's writing, but does relate the story particularly well, and occasionally achieves a literary feel.",2005
3,"I suppose if you've never seen any Hitchcock,Polanski,Lynch,or DePalma,and are under 25,you might have found this film suspenseful and disturbing.If you know your movies,then you found this to have a hackneyed premise,formulaic direction,and ""movie of the week"" scripting.I think Koepp should stick to adapting novels for other,more talented directors to re-invent.Bad film.I gave it a 3 because it was filmed near my place.Believe me,I'd like more than anything for an American movie filmed here in Vancouver to be good,but only about 3 have,and hundreds have been shot here.Too bad.Oh yeah,the ""shooter"" connection-what a pathetic case of a novelist cannibalizing his own stuff:""Redrum"" from ""The Shining"",now ""Shoot Her"".Lame.Should be ""Shoot 'em""/""Shoot Him""(lol)",2004
8,"This is based on the Stephen King short story called ""Secret Window, Secret Garden"". It is about Mort Rainey, a mystery writer who had recently divorced his wife because she has cheated on him. He is struggling with the loss and lives in a cabin on lake with his beloved dog. The movie begins with him taking a nap (he does that a lot in this movie) when he hears a knock on the door, at the door there is a man blaming him of plagiarism. He soon finds out that this man,John Shooter, is very serious about the story situation, he find s his beloved dog dead, along with a few other people. Who is this John Shooter? Does he even exist? Is Mort just plain crazy? Find the answer to all of these questions in this drama/thriller. The violence in this film is scarce but pretty graphic. The language is constant, but since it is PG-13 there is only one use of the F-word, with many used of the S-word. The sexual content is the basis of the movie. Overall i love this movie and recommend it to anyone, though some may find it boring.",2006
1,"Anyone who cannot not guess who the killer is in the first thirty seconds of this movie must ride the special bus. The guy is freaking talking to himself! Who else could it be? I can't believe I wasted my time on this movie. I watched thinking, ""No, him being the killer is just so stupid, it can't be true. Maybe there's some clever twist."" Nope. I actually laughed out loud at the idiotic ""shock"" ending. Johnny Depp, after talking to himself, sees his wife's car pull up. Then all of a sudden his house is magically a mess and the word ""shooter"" is carved into everything- oh, except for one spot where Johnny Depp is standing where it says ""shoot her."" Dumb, dumb, dumb. I can hardly believe such garbage got made- especially with such good actors.",2005
5,"I've ticked the 'spoilers' box, but this review doesn't really contain any spoilers: that's because even a total numb-nuts with the IQ of a flannel could figure out that Johnny Depp's character in Secret Window is a few sandwiches short of a picnic—a schizophrenic whose damaged psyche has created a murderous alter-ego. It's a twist telegraphed so clearly right from the start that it's almost impossible to spoil, although further evidence of Depp's nuttiness is liberally sprinkled throughout for those living vegetables that might struggle with such an oft-used plot device.",2013
4,"Johnny Depp is pretty nice, as one might expect, in fact all the cast is pretty nice. The script could have been made into something really interesting, but wasn't. The director did a really worthless job. Or the producer, I can't tell. There's some scenes and some music in some scenes that'll really going to make you laugh.. Crying ""OMG IT'S SO BAD"" Don't pay to see this B-movie. We, my friend and I basically figured out the whole movie out after 15-20 minutes.. But we said to ourselves ""no this cant be it, it cant be that cheesy"" .. Guess what .. it is .. Do yourself a favour and avoid the most predictable movie this year.",2004
10,"It's irreverent, funny, tragic, riveting. I have gasped out loud more than once while watching. Brilliant writing and acting. D. Leary is in his element and has created such a reality to his character Tommy Gavin that I can't believe Gavin isn't a real person. The only critique would be that the show does tend over do the quirkiness of some of the characters. But that is balanced by the cornerstone characters who are as lovable as they are offensive. The fast paced story lines and periodic shockers keep my heart rate pumping throughout the show. And there is always that lingering possibility that a fire is just around the corner to mix things up. I've never missed an episode and highly recommend it for adults, but watch it only after the kids are in bed :-)",2007
10,"Never has a show given so much to the viewer; drama, comedy, suspense, this show is the best thing to happen to television in years. I myself serve in the military and understand what it means to put a uniform on and defend the innocent and helpless. Dennis Leary was already a genius in my book; yet again he tops his past projects. I've read about his cousin (firefighter) passing away in a fire, so it seems that Mr. Leary takes this project very personnel. That desire to do well has enabled him to create the most enjoyable show I've ever seen. I just got my hands on season 2 and have barely done anything else but watch it. Do yourself a favor and tune it next time it airs. You won't be disappointed.",2006

9,"I recently discovered rescue me because of James McCaffrey being in it (Max Payne, baby!) and never have I enjoyed a TV series so much. This is so addicting that I devoured each season in about 2 days because it always pulls you in and of course, at the end, leaves you wanting MORE and to know what happens after the cliff hangers that inevitably fall at the end of each episode. I would get done with each series and think to myself, ""oh my dear lord did I seriously just watch 5 freaking hours of TV?"" What I loved so much about this show is the constant wondering if something was really happening or if it is imagined. Many times you would see Tommy destroying a room in anger or doing something terrible or drinking when he had committed to sobriety only to find out that he was just dreaming or having a flash of the way things could have been. That is reality for many people, and I for one am someone who often lives much too deeply in the past and forever feel guilt or sadness for things I will never be able to change, and I think that is why I connected so much to this show. Grief and sadness and resentment and anger are true in life even without such tragedies as 09/11 and some deal with it and some just can't or don't. The interesting thing to think about is, wouldn't it be AWESOME to be able to communicate with those people that you have left behind? To be able to have conversations with your dead cousin who was your best friend? Tommy gets to have savored every moment with them alive and now he gets to savor even more moments with them after they are gone. Sober or not, that is a truly magnificent thing that I think he often takes for granted.",2013
6,"After a failed attempt at a drama/comedy show that involves cops, Denis Leary came up with the idea of a series about firefighters in the aftermath of 9/11. The success of it was pretty inevitable with so many American hearts still beating for the everyday heroes who gave or risked their lives that momentous day in New York.",2006
9,"Okay, I've read many of the other reviews, mostly from 5-6 years ago, but I'm only seeing ""Rescue Me"" for the very first time (2012) thru Netflix. I LOVE, LOVE it. I watch episode after episode and am amazed at the truthfulness, the camaraderie between firefighters, the mistakes they make, the grittiness mixed with tenderness . . just too wonderful to shut out, after I've gone to bed. I feel so close to these guys. Having always liked Denis Leary's stand-up, I am now equally impressed at his writing skills, along with Mr. Tolan. I don't know how many episodes I'll be allowed to watch thru Netflix's Instant Streaming, but I know one thing, I'll be bummed-to-the-core when it does end. Why can't other TV shows get smart and take clues from this excellent drama? My next venture, ""The Job"" . . let's see if he continues to amaze me.",2012
7,It's hard to believe this show has come to its end. I have watched it since the first episode aired in 2004. It's almost surreal that it won't be airing anymore. To think the show started when I was 18 and ended when I was 25. That's no small chunk of my life. I think this is the first show I've actually watched from first to last episode from original airing time. (not including shows that were cancelled prematurely) most shows I either start later in the series (so I know it has momentum) or wait till the entire series is done then watch the DVD's.,2011
1,"Up until season 3 in the series, I was actually very impressed overall with Leary's series. It was gritty, raw, humorous and always dramatic, with realistic ties to the climate of NYC at the time. One thing that bothered me early on was the dismissal/joking around about Mike being raped by the couple he was invited around by in season one, I was willing to let it go.",2011
9,"Rescue Me is probably the best fictional account as far as movies or TV shows of what it's like to be a firefighter on a day in and day out basis. Backdraft was a good movie and all(Kurt Russell never makes a bad movie), but Rescue Me since it's a series and not just a 2 hour movie you get a better chance to really get to know the characters and see what makes them tick when you see a new episode of their exploits each week the shows is in season.",2012
5,"One reason I decided to watch this show in the first place was because of the extremely high ratings it got on IMDb, and the praise lauded upon it. Some of the praise is beyond much debate. For instance, the acting is superb, with a realism that at times is almost eerie in it's precision. Being at least partially written by Dennis Leary, there's a fair amount of humor (albeit often very adolescent humor) which certainly helps one catch a breath between all the bleakness. For at least the first half of the first season, I was quite impressed with the show, and the way in which it took time to develop compelling characters; and I appreciated that despite the firefighting premise, the firefighting was not overdone, and is actually somewhat in the background of the series, which really focuses on the characters.",2010
10,"This was a very gripping tale of truth for anyone who has lived through 9/11 in NYC. Even after 10 years this show can still make people understand what is going on in survivors heads on a daily basis. Denis has done a great job ""teaching"" others why we act the way we act. Why we do what we do after such a life changing day. It also brings to light the way city life is just so abnormal, so bizarre and how people who stay too long just become immune to what a good life can be. He also brings to light all the real issues that occur in the NYFD, being witnessed to much of the antics in my life I can attest to the sad truth. I feel sad that the show's run is over. This was one of the most realistic shows out there. The fire scenes maybe fake but they never where the point of the show. The show was meant to show people what happens in the personal lives of survivors of the greatest attack on US soil and how they cope. Even if the coping was centered around one person, it still showed that all of these guys feel sad, angry and lost inside. It really needs to come back for another season or so.",2014
10,"What can i say? this is the most un-hollywoodish, non-artificial, non- superficial, real, real, real and amazingly reality story based show without any typical nonsense or a fear of rejection from the audience... Denis leary should easily be put in the list of top 10 actors of all time, what a wonderful job has he done... he has put his heart and soul into this show, whether or not you are a 9/11 victim (I had my cousin who was one of the 334 firefighters), you are surely gonna love this show and not realise for a single moment that its television and not real life... but it sure as hell makes us feel like its all real, the drama, the emotions, the love, the family bonding, the effing irish attitude and culture, the lust, the change of heart!! everything....",2014
1,"The single most shocking thing about this series is that it wasn't canned immediately after the pilot was made. The acting and script are atrocious. I tried to watch the first episode and just couldn't put myself through it. Machismo to the point of misogyny this show is just offensive. I cannot believe the positive reviews it is receiving here. The only emotion showed is brooding, seething anger. Gross! This is also attempted to be shown in light of desired masculinity but nothing could be more off-putting! I have, thankfully, never met a person like any of the horrid characters in this poor excuse for television. How did this even get made?",2014
9,"On paper I can see the argument that there is little morally redemptive quality to a film like Dead Man's Shoes, no diamond polished by the end credits to reward an audience going through the trauma. But to actually sit through the film, and most importantly, to be subjected to another of Paddy Consadines' electric performances, is an extra-ordinarily vital, if viceral experience.",2004
9,"Well, you can probably tell from the summary that I thought this was a really good film. To be frank, from the first few minutes I felt that knot in my stomach that comes from deep apprehension and anxiety; I was being manipulated from the off, and it just got more and more intense.",2004

10,"I was starting to give up on British films. They all seem to be too considered, too focus grouped, too controlled by the marketing mafia. So it was so very refreshing to see a movie that has the inspired spontaneity so common in Japanese cinema, but with a very British story. Shane Meadows uses characters from his own past as source material, and co-writer Paddy Considine (Richard) based part of the story on family history, so we have a film that has authentic characters and authentic, semi-improvised dialogue. The revenge thriller format has never seemed more sophisticated. Richard's calculated derangement is balanced by the thuggish banality displayed by his targets, whose crimes initially seem more like misdemeanors until the last act. This movie is well paced, laugh out loud funny, and darkly menacing as it proceeds inexorably to its grim conclusion. If only more British films were like this, we might even have a film industry. It shows that the only way to make good films in the UK is to do it behind the studio's backs!",2004

It's a film that makes you feel, and it makes you feel alive. And it makes you stop and think, and that is a pretty amazing thing considering the world we live in. It's raw and unforgiving, and it's to the point. If you want a film that will stay inside you for a long time, this is it. The images and the settings are truly beautiful. It's a breath of fresh air in the midst of Hollywood plastic productions. Love is not always pretty and easy, and this film will show you just how painful love can be.

6,"I find the movie's rating is a bit overrated on IMDb , either because there's few users rated this film , or most of the people find this movie interesting , i think the movie's plot goes slow to keep the viewer suspended and i like that , but the bad news is most of the movie was kind of boring until the final scenes where the gripping actions toke place. i believe that the screen writing was mediocre , the directing isn't clever , but not bad too , and most of the actors don't fit their roles except for ""Paddy Considine"" and ""Toby Kebbell"" as for performance , they did extremely splendid job they deserve an Oscar for it . The movie gained unsatisfactory gross , probably because Shane Meadows wasn't well renowned back then , because at time he hadn't made his successful movie ""This Is England"" yet . if you're into disturbing movies , this may have your liking because of its rare topic , so don't miss it .",2017

7,"I don't quite share in the massively high praise that Dead Man's Shoes has been getting, seemingly across the board. While it is a nice film with some good performances, it's also rather one-note and methodical. The film deals with revenge and it follows the brother of a wronged retard that goes back to the town where his brother was killed in order to get revenge on the men that did it. The story is told in flashbacks, which is then mixed with the brother getting revenge. The themes of revenge and 'the beast in all of us' are well placed and skilfully handled, but the film falls down in it's bid to be a completely successful whole when it comes to the emotion surrounding the situation. It's really difficult to care for any of the characters, and when you've got one of them on a mission to get revenge for being wronged; it doesn't help if you don't really care about him or his situation. It seems that Paddy Considine, actor and writer, thought that the situation itself will get the audience involved on it's own - and it does, somewhat, but not enough for the film to not at least to some extent feel like it's just an excuse for some gritty acting.",2005

Starring Paddy Considine, it tells the story of an ex-soldier who returns home to a small town in the Midlands seeking revenge on a group of thugs who have terrorised his younger brother. The film, at first, embraces the ultimate act of revenge with dark humour and disturbing violence, but soon turns out to criticise what effect vengeance has on the protagonist.",2017
10,"Dead Man's Shoes is almost like a Clint Eastwood, shot without the glory of Hollywood and a high budget. Instead this film leaves a devastating effect through it's immense realism. I feel this realism is created through the brilliance of acting, along with the bleak English feel, and the dialogue that seems entirely accurate to the characters who speak it. By this I mean the script is not over- dramatised, but is rather fully believable. ",2017
10,"This is one of those films that sticks in the mind for all the right reasons. Great acting, great script, and utterly gripping. Paddy Considine was outstanding as the psychotic ex-paratrooper hell-bent on revenge for the death of his brother Anthony, played by Tony Kebell. Kebell's portrayal of the retarded sibling is just terrific. The supporting cast were on form too. I'm still both haunted and mesmerised by that long black & white sequence leading to Anthony's death and Richard's lonely face at the bus stop, quietly grieving for his little brother. Together with the music, it's powerful stuff. I've never seen Shane Meadows' other work but after seeing this, I'll definitely keep an eye out for his next movies.",2005

A former soldier Richard returns to his home town to extract revenge on the gang who abused his younger brother Anthony and what an evil gang of subhuman pond life they are , drug dealers , sadists and sexual perverts and the depressing thing is that all large towns and cities in Britain have them in reality whilst avenging angels such as Richard only seem to belong in films . I promise you that you'll be having nightmares about what Anthony has to endure at the hands of the gang in general and the fists of gang leader Sonny in particular ",2010
3,"This picture is amateur hour at its very worst. From the clumsy editing to the ear bleeding dialog (if it wasn't completely improvised, hard to tell when no real actors were actually hired), Dead man's shoes never aspires to be much more than a low budget B-movie at best. The positive user reviews that you will find in here are a complete joke and thoroughly dishonest. Apparently the entire production crew signed up to pen down lavish acclaim which will have you rolling your eyes in disdain if you've actually manage to see the dog they are describing. Nice going guys! ",2010
10,There are four scenes that I will treasure forever:,2004
10,"...is that it ends. This is a fantastic film. It joins the handful of movies where I think I liked the sequel even more than the original, although I liked 'Before Sunrise' as well. Where Sunrise captured the immediacy and urgency of perfect youthful love, Sunset reflects beautifully on the aftermath of that perfection. I remember a line that says ""nothing that is complete breathes"", and I think that is what we see in this film. A perfect connection with another human is a blessing and a curse; having experienced perfection a part of us stops breathing, unable or unwilling to mar the perfection of that memory.",2004
10,"I'd been longing to see this one as I'd always thought 'Before Sunrise' was one of the most honest, most real films I'd ever seen, but at the same time I held off seeing the sequel from fear of disappointment. For all of you in the same position, fear not ; Linklater, Hawke and Delphy (for it has surely been a joint effort and labour of love for all three) have done us and themselves proud. I've just seen the film and despite being male and 38 I feel like Roberta Flack must have felt when she penned 'Killing me Softly' after hearing Don McLean sing 'Vincent' in concert; this is - once again - just so close to what it's all about. You want technicalities? The acting, superb; Hawke and Delphy slip right back into their characters, their mannerisms, their sometimes gauche repartee, the way they seem to fence around each other, seeming to go in for the kill then feigning, drawing backExquisite. And then the details, the echoes of the first film in the settings but now with a world-weariness, an autumnal note and yet with still that fundamental freshness and optimism that revives the memories of Sunrise's youthfulness and reminds us, as our heroes discuss, that though time changes people, there remains an unchanging core. Just see it; this is about as good as it gets, folks.",2004
10,"Before Sunset is one of those movies, you either love, or you hate.",2004
10,"I had not seen the prequel to this although my date had and she filled me in on many details. While the experience of this film would be enriched by having seen the preceding film first, it certainly stands satisfactorily alone.",2004
8,"""Before Sunrise"" was one of the most beautiful independent love stories of the 90's. Part of its appeal came from the open ending. We didn't know how the lives of these two young people would continue and what would become of them. The whole movie was like a snapshot that left the rest to our imagination. A sequel to such a story seemed to be unnecessary, but apparently director Richard Linklater himself couldn't stop thinking about these two intriguing characters and had to envision their lives after this one fateful day in Vienna.",2004
10,"Nine years on Celine and Jessie meet in Paris not entirely by destiny or sheer force of circumstance... Nine years ago I loved Before Sunrise so much! And identified with it even though I was far from home not out of choice - and a war of the kind that bothered Celine in Bosnia was going on in my own country... But I was young. I was 24, actually, very romantic and innocent. Now I Know how things work a little better. The world, relationships. But I'm still plunging into causes for their own sake. And I'm still a reasonably normal person. Just like the characters in this film. Paris has never looked simpler in its casual elegance. Dialogue has never seemed more natural. A script never touched real life like this one so effortlessly. I'm in love with these characters - and with the ending... This is how European Cinema used to be - and Hollywood, too for that matter. Naturally real and magical in the details.",2005
10,"A sequel to the 1995 film ""Before Sunrise"". Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and  Celine (Julie Delpy) meet 9 years after their initial meeting. They've  changed--originally they were in their 20s and full of idealism. Now  they're in their 30s--and their lives have changed in ways they didn't  predict. Like the first movie they walk around Paris this time and talk about love, life, reality, what  might have been--and it's all fascinating. Like the first film this is  basically a character study and (like the first) just incredible. It's  like catching up with old friends after 9 years apart! They've aged a  lot--Hawke looks TERRIBLE but Delpy looks OK--and life has thrown both  a few hard knocks but hearing how they survived and what they went  through is just incredible.   This is NOT for everybody (four people walked out when I went to see  it) but, for people who can deal with nonstop talk for 80 minutes it is  just great. Every single line rings true and is delivered full force by  Hawke and Delpy. The acting varies--Hawke is good (but he smiles WAY  too much)--Delpy is just superb all the way through.  This is easily one of the best films of 2004. Highly recommended.",2004
10,"I saw this movie with my husband. He is usually a die-hard fan of action thrillers, special effects and horror movies but he allows me to coax him into seeing a really thoughtful movie every once in a while. So this was my choice for the evening. Neither one of us had seen the first movie, ""Before Sunrise"", although I knew of it by reputation. Well, my husband absolutely loved the movie! He sat up and became totally engrossed in the story, frequently patting my hand at intervals as he identified with the the characters in the story. He forgot about the dreadful uncomfortable movie seat. He let up a big sigh of disappointment when the credits came up... Personally, I grew up in Paris, France, I came to the US for graduate studies and I had an environmental protection career for 20 years. So I could strongly identify with Celine, a young woman of French origin with a patina of US graduate schooling and a career in environmental protection work. Her vulnerability shines through her modern chatterbox exterior. The acting is absolutely superb, with the intimate extended conversations drawing us into the characters' lives. Certainly, this movie can stand on its own. For Jesse and Celine, the opportunity to pick up once more their romantic relationship is here! A smart couple would not let the moment pass. I doubt that they would just have a quick passionate affair... I think that the characters already know how lonely their souls can be without true love and commitment and they are emotionally ready to grasp this chance of a lifetime. They have been around long enough to know how rare their type of romantic feeling and connection can be. They will cherish their unique relationship and nurture it forever. My husband and I agreed that the movie could only be watched by couples of ""a certain age"", rather than young couples still searching for life's meaning. Only people who have lived through the throes of searching for a lifelong mate, then living through the disappointments and joys of struggling relationships, can recognize and appreciate what true love is and how important it is to go with one's heart and seize the moment. ",2004
9,"This film is one of my favorites from last year, along with ""Sideways"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"". Is it just a coincidence that three best films of the year all deal with ability to connect with other people, with meeting one's true love and losing it, with memories that will not go away, and with possibilities of second chances?",2005
10,"When I saw Before Sunrise I really enjoyed it. It was the essence of every romantic travel fantasy and, lets face it, Ethan Hawke was the stuff that fantasies are made of. Having enjoyed the first movie so much I was really looking forward to the sequel but was also feeling some trepidation. What if they made a mess of it? Fortunately when I finally got to see the film any concern was put to rest. Before Sunset is everything I wanted in a sequel. The characters had matured in a way that made sense. You could see how the young Jessie and Celine had come to be these thirty-something people. There was no sickly sweet romantic perfection. These characters were clearly the product of real life, effected by their decisions good or bad, making compromises, sometimes insecure, a little scarred, but still holding on to memories and dreams of perfect moments. They are still on a journey but no longer sure that their destination is the right one. Unsure whether they can change direction, or even if they should, but afraid of what will happen if they don't.",2005
10,"This is simply one of the best movies I've seen, with very few qualifications. Maybe I should say that this is one of the best ""simple"" movies I've seen. Perhaps it is a bit like cooking, use fresh and quality ingredients and you can make something great without a lot of unnecessary stuff. Unfortunately, Hollywood just doesn't seem to have the ambition to make these type of movies anymore.",2004
10,"This follow-up to the cult hit 'Before Sunrise' takes place nine years after the original masterpiece. The wisdom of making a sequel nine years later to a film that doesn't really need a sequel is questionable. Or at least it would be, if this film was anything less than brilliant. While the first film depicted an energetic and youthful romance between two young people; this sequel is a more mature tale, all about reflection. Before Sunset plays out almost as a tribute to the one night that the characters spent together in the first film, and analyses what happened to them after those events. The film takes in themes of missed opportunity and the effect that time has on character. Just like the first film, time is of the essence again and we follow Jesse, now the writer of an international best seller who meets up with Celine again, this time in Paris. The two take to the streets and begin discussing their relationship with each other, with their respective partners and how life has been treating them in the last nine years.",2005
1,"A truly gag-worthy inside look at the juvenile, self-serving world view which motivates Hollywood writers and producers. Ethan Hawke was physically unappealing (can't he get his teeth fixed?!), his character narcissistic beyond belief. Julie Delpy is so busy trying to be charming as her character tells Jesse about all the wonderfully righteous things she has been doing to save the planet from all the bad actors in the world who are polluting everything, while she and Jesse puff away on their ciggies. Hello? The first few minutes of interviewing Ethan Hawke's character were laughable. I simply couldn't buy the idea that any person this inarticulate could have written a novel considered a worthwhile piece of literature. Jesse (Hawke) sounds like a bumbling 19 year old college sophomore. After 30 minutes of this disgusting drivel, I decided to preserve my stomach and eject the disc.",2012
1,"What an utter piece of clap-trap. This is another example of a pseudo-intellectual cinematech art-house experiment that has gone tragically wrong. Unfortunately, it has now claimed the lives of many viewers who too spineless to say they hated it because expressing an honest opinion might cause them to be scorned by those who feel that this movie is a work of art. This movie was no ""Dinner with Andre"" nor was it in the league of other great script intensive movies. This was simply a bad movie. The characters were self-absorbed and terribly uninteresting. The script was stuffed with cookie-cutter philosophical quotes and paraphrases and I wanted to vomit after hearing each utterance. The city of Paris could have been used a distinct character in this movie, in the way that Tokyo was used in ""Lost in Translation"". However, the city of lights was relegated to being a cheap background as if it was on the backstage lot at Universal. Please, please, please, do not make ""Before Moonrise"". Just let the sun set on this steaming pile of tripe.",2005

1,"This film lacked all the charm of the first. In Before Sunrise we have this intriguing & alluring physical attraction and intellectual interest between two characters that ""destiny"" has united on a train. We follow them through an exhilaratingly spontaneous evening as their youthfully curious sensual dynamism develops. Their dialogue is interesting and sincere, and their attraction is sweet and sort of nostalgia-evoking. ",2013
10,"Before Sunset provides us not so much a sequel as a continuing development in the lives of these characters, who are starting to embody the neuroses and deeply-held desires that neither want to admit to until it's at the most crucial and tragic of times. Jessie (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy), who first met on a train in Vienna in 1994, meet again nine years later as Jessie has published a book which is based on that night they had together. He's in Paris, they meet again, and before he has his plane back to the states they talk, and talk, and talk, and unlike in the first film there are no asides. It's just two people who at first talk about concerns that came up for them the first time, if a bit more pragmatic: what it is to have concern over the environment, to live in the USA, to be involved enough in a relationship. There's even a moment of deja-vu where they talk about reincarnation and a respect for faith if not an embracing of it. But then we also get to see something much deeper in each side that Jessie's book and mere re-appearance for Celine brings out a memory that has become hyper-realized, and vice-versa.",2007

9,"I really loved this film. I will freely admit that I have a penchant for romantic comedies, but I have seen my share of bad ones and this is definitely a must-see for fans of the genre. It works because it has a far-fetched storyline that allows for the two main characters to frolic around Europe with two secret service agents on their tails. It also works because of the beautiful backdrop of Europe as the setting for this fairy tale romance. The locations the director chose are stunning- mainly Prague and Venice. Gorgeous! The romantic glow of Europe makes the movie so much more romantic. It's not hard to believe that Anna and Ben fall in love while taking a moonlit gondola ride. I also really enjoyed the story line of the two secret service agents who are trying to find Anna- Weiss and Morales- in many ways their romance is even more enjoyable storyline than that of the main characters. The music used in the film works very well, too. Mandy Moore and Matthew Goode are new actors but they have palpable chemistry and both work perfectly in their roles. For a romantic comedy I'd have to say... 9/10",2004

This is probably the first romantic comedy to come out since ""How to Lose A Guy in Ten Days"" that I've really really enjoyed.

And Matthew Goode was is great with dry humor, and a decent actor. The scenery was gorgeous, the story humorous, the actors pulled if off well...this movie should have done so much better.",2004

I first discovered Mandy in how to deal which i absolutely love! I loved Halleys character and the way Mandy creates the shyness so well. But in Chasing Liberty, It was the sense of adventure and the passion between Anna and Ben that drew me in. The concert where the Roots are playing, the opera movie, the big dash for the train scene and the music, Venice and the gondolier, walking across Europe, bungee jumping and the love parade shows excitement and fun, urging the audience to see the world. the other scenes of stripping and the ""spoilt little rich girl"" acts were just added humor and cliché. And yes, Matthew goode did very well in playing the hero/hottie/antagonist. i don't know if its Mandy or just a coincidence that i love her 'chick flick' movies, but Chasing Liberty is a movie i could watch over and over.",2005

Matthew Goode and Mandy Moore had lovely chemistry together and their relationship was so lovely; equally as cute was the subplot concerning Morales and Weiss's romance and Mark Harmon as the President and the Agents in sunglasses were hysterical. While it didn't stretch my brain, it did brighten up my evening and there should be more made like this.",2005

This is the problem now. the daughter of a president cannot just get up and go, and plans are made by both her and her father the president( without each one knowing what the other is doing). Plans are set in motion during a trip to Prague. With the assistance of the daughter of a French Ambassador she eludes her escorts and sets out on an odyssey thought Europe, accompanied by a mysterious stranger.

Mandy Moore does an excellent job of portraying her role as a frustrated daughter of a president...that's a tough role to play. Her partner does a great job of maintaining the proper perspective between keeping it cool and freaking out. I thought the admission of love she asks of him after the bungee jumping could have been done a bit better but other than that, it kept my attention. Of course, Mandy taking her clothes off three times helps, too. The other characters (the super spies) falling in love works well.",2005

My greatest regret was watching  this in an expensive cinema and not walking out during the 1st 15 minutes to get a refund.  Why did they cast anabella sciorra (Agent Morales) who is obviously italian as a hispanic? There was a scene where she spoke italian as if she was one of the locals. I guess it would have been more believable if she just was cast as what she really was ethnically(an italian).

If you are up for a challenge, I recommend you view this film... research it a little (not too much)... watch it again, and then go read the forums at primermovie.com - but importantly, do not go there before watching it at least twice in my opinion. It's amazing what can be done with only $7,000 - in comparison to what others do with $200,000,000.

Second I love independent movies as it gives me a chance to focus on a story without being distracted by big budget effects or big Hollywood stars. Third I love strange nonlinear movies or movies that doesn't always explain everything leaving the viewer to speculate what happened. So given all this I should've loved Primer but I didn't. Primer suffers from some of the worst dialogue ever and I mean the worst ever! The jargon didn't bother me as much as it did some people, as a science fiction fan I am used to tech talk jargon so whether or not it can be understood by science egg heads or not doesn't concern me. What concerns me is so much dialogue was spoken but nothing was ever said. Sometimes dialogue from several characters overlap and you're never sure who's speaking. Worse yet since this is a time travel movie when you hear Aaron speak you're not sure if it's Aaron A or Aaron B or Aaron C etc...There are times when the story seems to jump around for no apparent reason like when the characters are all of a sudden in a fountain looking for a cat??????? Some people have suggested reading the Wikipedia plot analysis but what kind of movie needs a plot analysis to enjoy? The characters were dull and most of the time I didn't care or feel anything for them, I even hoped one would be killed off so I only had to follow the other guy.

Shane Carruth did an excellent job to produce a film of high technical quality on such a low budget, unfortunately: when one person writes, directs, edits and plays a lead role in a film they tend to lose sight of the fact that the audience is not as familiar with the plot or story line as they are. This film spiraled out of control from about two thirds of the way through by the end I had no idea what the point of the story was and felt that I must have missed some vital piece of information that would make some sense of it.

1,"How I wanted to enjoy this movie. This movie ""makes you think""? Maybe if you're a twentysomething, sick of the Hollywood crap out there, but not really educated enough in classic science fiction to recognize when someone is recycling old paradoxes, and not mature enough to require character development from the figures on the screen. For the rest of us, it does not matter how much the filmmaker supposedly ""captures the atmosphere"" of engineers who speak in monotone. As Sontag said, the audience should not be called upon to react as if what is happening in fiction is actually happening in real life. (If I make a boring film in which people really go to the bathroom, is that brilliant as well?) The cinema verite style here does not work and is not appropriate, and despite the barrage of early 10-star reviews - obviously planted by cheerleaders connected with this project - that signals a failure by the filmmaker to engage his audience, which is, yes, his job. Smugness about how people ""don't get it"" is not film criticism - at any rate, we do get it, because the story is paper-thin. Show, don't tell - give us action (and I do not mean superficial action as in ""Independence Day""), not relentless unemotional dialog that appeals to young, largely male, geeks. (All of the important male characters here are married, with kids - what irony!) Film, like any other art, is communication, and while this film has potential, that makes the inept execution of it all the more disappointing. Actually, I would recommend that people see it, with the caveats that I've given above, because it is an example of a good idea; however, in no way does this film deserve such effusive, histronic praise. Oh, and incidentally - electrical current is measured in amperes, not in ""volts."" (Volts measure voltage, duh.)

1,"I don't mind a movie that doesn't spend a lot of money on itself. But this piece of ""I'm a movie maker, you're too stupid to understand it"" should never have made it even to DVD. After 10 minutes of trying to understand what the wooden non-actors were saying, I decided that it would be better not to suffer any more. Maybe the writer, actor, director was satisfied with his output. But it might be better for the film industry if he decided to do something more in keeping with his ability. And judged by his efforts in this film, he really doesn't have any. Don't be fooled by ""This is an amateur film made on a shoe-string budget."" It is a bore and definitely not worth watching.",2006
1,Officially the worst film I have ever seen.,2013
8,"Yes, there is a chance that you will NOT like this movie. That's because it is not a movie made for the majority of paying cinema goers, but it is a movie made for the sake of movie making.

That's what watching this movie is like.",2013
10,"This movie is great, I had the opportunity to see it twice at Sundance, the first time it was very confusing. The second time, it makes sense, when you can understand all the story tricks and plot twists. I think this film is in t he same vane as Memento, Existenz or The Usual Suspects, you have to watch it twice to know whats going on. I had the opportunity to talk to Shane Carruth the maker of this film and aside from being a really nice guy, he explained that you simply have to watch it a few times and pay attention to the doubles and triples of people. This film won 2 well deserved awards at Sundance because it truly embodies the independent spirit of film making.",2004
10,"No spoilers. I just saw this and thought it was great. It beats Hollywood films because it portrays science in a believable way. The acting was also good and very believable. Shane Carruth did a fine job as writer, director, and actor. I give it an A+.",2004

I have no kids, no Satellite TV and therefore no legitimate reason to have caught any episodes of SBSP. However, I did see some of the trailers, and being a submarine nut I loved them.

10,Take the funniest things about Spongebob Squarepants (wacky-anarchist environment and extremely funny animated drawings) and make it an hour-and-a-half long.

10,"Lol this movie was SO awesome! I loved it because I LOVE the Spongebob Squarepants show... It is so funny and I knew the movie had to be excellent! You know how in the show Spongebob always wanted to be ""Employee of the Month""? Well, now in the movie, he wants to be a manager... But not just only of the Krusty Krab...but of the ""Krusty Krab 2"" !!!! But will it work out for Spongebob? He is up against the ""not very excited"" Squidward Tennisballs....sorry....Tenacles. Squidward Tentacles. LOL. Anyway, eventually Spongebob and Patrick start a very dangerous mission to get to ""Shell City""! There are many obstacles along the way. Will they get there to save the day? Or will fate slap them in the face? Check out the movie to find out. To sum it up, this movie is irresistible and very funny. REMEMBER : ""Cleanliness is next to mannerliness!""",2006
10,"It was recently my 15th birthday and a friend of mine gave me this film the day after I got back from my birthday holiday. Mum wasn't sure that I'd be interested but the film had me intrigued. It's hilarious, particularly the part where Spongebob and Patrick are blowing bubbles and an earlier part where they're eating ice cream extra fast (spoiler alert). If I were younger, I'd have cried when Spongebob and Patrick dried out (except I'm a boy) (spoiler alert. There's another spoiler after this) Thankfully the tears short-circuited the lamp and the smoke set off the sprinklers bringing everyone back to life.",2006

And while the first season of Spongebob was fairly funny, as far as I've seen, the later seasons have lost touch. So when this movie came out I thought it was just the shows chance to go down... in movie form, as many Nickelodeon shows have. But boy was I wrong. Perhaps the funniest movie of my time, and DEFINITELY the funniest Nickelodeon one, this is a diamond in the rough. Its great comedic talent alone... plus the fact that its NOT just one long Episode of Spongebob, but a movie on its own, makes it worth seeing, but the visuals, while just like the show, maybe a LITTLE tuned up, make the movie. Watch the movie once and laugh at its humor. Watch it again and laugh just as much from watching Spongebob and Patricks expressions as they do various hilarious things. Even if your not a Spongebob fan... even if you HATE Spongebob, you will LOVE this movie! Its that good!",2005
8,"If you for some reason have not seen this movie it is WAY funnier than the mild kid TV show and is totally awesome even my 54 year old dad liked 100 times more than Napoleon Dynamite and a lot better than Spirited Away. Yep that's how good this movie is. Patrik again is the best character and is extremely funny and Spongebob is really funny for a change and thank god they leave out Sandy, she is really annoying. The songs are really funny and even the characters that aren't supposed to be funny were funny like King Neptune and Mr.Krabs. Great plot, funny movie,appropriate for all ages,and is definitely one of those movies you can watch over and over again.This movie is just a good animated film period.10/10 stars",2005
10,"I was lucky enough to receive this DVD as a Father's Day present, the idea being that my young son and I could watch it together. Well. I tried, but only one of us showed much interest... me! What a movie! SpongeBob and Patrick the starfish set out on a dangerous journey to find King Neptune's crown. That's the basic plot, but it really doesn't matter what they do. What's important is how they do it. And they do it well. SpongeBob is one of my favourite cartoon creations of the last ten years, and he does not disappoint in this, his first movie. It is hilarious! It's full of one liners, bizarre situations and fantastically silly animation. Like in the series there is a weird blend of live-action with the animation from time to time, which just adds to the surreal feel of the movie. This is particularly so when our two heroes hitch a lift on David Hasselhof's back. There are also some great musical moments, which are so unpredictable that you find yourself laughing uncontrollably! At least, I did anyway.",2005
9,"I was hoping for a huge adventure filled with laughter, I didn't want to be disappointed, I didn't want Spongebob coming out dry.",2005
10,"When King Neptune's precious crown is stolen he accuses Mr. Krabs, freezes him, and it's up to the lovable talking sponge to save him. SpongeBob SquarePants and Patrick Star hit every hilarious reef with witty humor, an encounter with a ""cyclops"", and goofy goober-ness. The film is a howlingly funny treat for all kids and adults alike. If you love SpongeBob, you'll embrace this movie. All the delightfully corny jokes and lovable characters are here. While the Rugrats and Hey Arnold movies were somewhat disappointing, SpongeBob conquers with way more than just barnacle loaf. One of the greatest cartoon characters of all time just got greater. Get ready for some major laughs!",2005
10,"To begin, I LOVED THIS MOVIE. I don't know if it was the adult themed story, the classic lines that you could find yourself repeating as if it was a cult classic, or the simplistic nature of the story, but I simply fell in love with this wacky piece of cinema. SpongeBob is not your typical hero, and his friend Patrick, doesn't seem to fit the mold of your typical ""best-friend role"". I found myself laughing at this film because of the messages that it taught and how I guy like me, stuck in the retail world, could easily identify with the trauma that SpongeBob was experiencing. Also, this film was flat out hysterical. I wasn't expecting anything except for kids humor when I first watched it, but after the final credits rolled I was impressed by how adult oriented the humor truly was. The comic timing was perfect, the music resonated perfectly in my ear, and I can honestly say that from the opening pirate credits to the final jump in the air, this film was the rawest form of cinematic perfection and the BEST film I have seen this 2005 year (so far).",2005
10,"this film is awesome. the ending song is probable up their with the ending song to South Park(another great cartoon movie) although this is aimed at a completely different audience! OK i may bee 16 but i still have a young side of me wanting to see silly cartoons like sponge bob and fairly odd parents! me and my friends were probably the oldest non-child taking people in the audience but we felt at home. we were sat next to a young family of around mid 20 year olds whom had a child of around 5/6 years old and we couldn't stop laughing the parents took the mick out of us as we entered the cinema but as we left they realised why so many teens love the series. also the people going on and on about the homosexual references in the film they need to realise that the film makers knew that parents were going to see the film and were going to be worried about the reference so they went and ""covertly"" (hiddenly?!) put it in their for the parents enjoyment. the best part by far is the scene where sponge bob is ""hungover"" because of his ice creams bender! way better than shrek and his toy counterparts just for shere F.U.N! ps: I'm a goofy goober..........ROCK.",2005
10,"This movie is one of the best I've seen. After reading all of the reviews, I would've thought I wouldn't have liked it. But, this movie had me rolling on the floor in laughter in some parts. I knew I loved the series, and I buy all the seasons, but when I saw this movie, I just couldn't help myself but to laugh. I can't believe that this movie is out already at after it was in the theaters 2 months ago. They make everything and everybody so funny, just how they say it, and what they do. I am so happy now that I picked this up. This movie is great for all ages, and though it is intended for smaller children, I could easily see older adults laughing at this movie. This movie has extremely nice and vibrant cartoon effects. And I love how they blended real-life parts with the cartoons. They even showed the character's shadow on the real background. The sound is perfect, I wouldn't change a thing, I especially love the last song of the movie (which I won't state in case of spoilers for the movie). Basically, if you love Spongebob even the slightest bit, buy this movie. It's just so wonderful all the way around.",2005

10,"This movie is really great and captures the true Spongebob spirit and also keeps you thinking whats going to happen next. I have always loved spongebob as long as I can remember an absolutely couldn't wait for the movie to hit theaters. The thing that is really funny about the Spongebob movie is Spongebob and Patrick act really immature and they don't realize it until late in the movie when spongebob proves they are actually men and not kids. The thing I like most about the movie was Spongebob was still his character and is very good at being it. Any kid who likes Spongebob but wants more, don't stop there because there are plenty of laughs for whoever will watch it.",2008

I have never walked out of any movie theatre in my life, I however walked out on this one and I'm mad that I even spent $1 dollar to go see it. They should pay people to see this move. Bad acting by Halle Berry and the cast, bad plot line, bad scenerios, bad writing, bad special effects, bad music score. Did I miss anything??? Yeah I got jipped out of two hours of my life, can they give me a refund??? I'm only writing this so that maybe, just maybe we can send a message to Hollywood that we will not tolerate this level of junk sold to us. We must send a message that we want great art instead of a formulated product that the public must buy.",2004

1,"Oh my, where do I begin? Well I could tell you that this is a well made action movie, but obviously I would be lying my head off. So instead, I want to tell you the truth. Are you ready? Here it comes ""DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE"" Let me tell you why. If you see this movie and are over the age of 16, you will end up hating yourself for letting yourself rot for 104 minutes without getting anything back, except an increased feeling of wanting to get revenge on Hollywood. They say that it is very hard to get your script into a movie. Well, after seeing this movie, I think a one legged monkey could write a better script, without either pen or paper. The fact that Halle Berry even uses a male stunt double, makes me loose all respect for both her and this movie. Besides the stunt double thing, the movie still sucks. The dialog sucks, the acting is not even present and the action looks sloppy and poorly thought through. This movie actually made me like The Core better, which is pretty much impossible. I rate this movie 1/10",2005

Ms Berry danced and pranced to no avail. Is there any way I can get thoese 90 minutes of my life back? Quite a few people left, but I stayed to the end. ""He chose poorly"".

1,"I have never rated a movie as awful but it was easy to do so with this one. Halle Berry is a beautiful and talented actress but in this movie looked and acted like a cardboard cut-out. What could have been a funny movie filled with campy humor turned out to be a meaningless sequence of events that neither told a story or developed a character. Even the special effects were not realistic or visually appealing. The real true star of the film was the cat who saved Halle Berry's character from death. This beautiful feline (the real cat) stole every scene it was in. If you start with a fantasy as the premise for a film be sure you support the fantasy and try to tell the audience a story, which is entertaining. Save your money there are a lot of great films available, unfortunately, this isn't one.",2005

1,"When watching Catwoman, it is justifiable and understandable to enter a fit of rage for seemingly no reason. Subconsciously, this is your body using its animal instinct, fight or flight if you will, in an attempt to get as far away from this 'movie' as possible. This is the worst film ever made. Halle ""I won an Oscar for sleeping with Billy Bob Thornton on camera"" Berry pretends to act here, portraying Patience Phillips (Selina Kyle anyone?) a loser who works at an evil makeup company, wherein she stumbles upon an evil makeup plot by Sharon Stone and her evil homosexual sidekick. I guess it makes sense, especially to a man simply known as Pitof, who directed this mess. Direction would allude to clarity, which this film does not contain, most likely due to the fact that does not speak English. If he could, there is NO WAY that he would have read the script and felt that it was appropriate to go ahead and make this into a film. Lets not even get into specifics here, because the cinematography, soundtrack, CGI, and especially the acting is the worst I have ever seen. If you don't believe me watch the basketball scene and see if you don't want to hurt people. Watching this film is like someone punching your mother in the face. I tried, I desperately tried to finish the film twice, and neither time my intelligence and dignity simply wouldn't let me. Its just that bad. I could go on and on..... the scene where the cat lady explains to Halle that cats choose one woman like Neo from the Matrix and that cats are magic and whatever else was said while I wasn't paying attention....the laughable fight scenes, the fact that she becomes cat like and licks herself clean and chases crickets etc.... I'm mad at myself that I'm even writing this review, maybe its like Freddy Krueger and we can make it go away by not fearing it. Awful. Disgusting. Disgraceful to all of film. Catwoman.",2007

She then reemerges as a ""cat woman"", with super agility and strength to rival that of Spider-Man or the Crow, and more ferocious personality, which she compliments by going with a short butch haircut instead of her initial long curly locks, and starts running around in a hooker/porn outfit with a whip and begins beating up people.

And the Razzies people (The Oscars for bad acting and bad films) awarded her worst actress of the year for playing in the film. It was V for Vendetta for Heroine Halle. Anyway, back to the film, Halle's character is a scruffy looking secretary type working for a top cosmetic company when she accidental discovers the secret to the company's formulas and is killed for her curiosity. As she slowly slips away, a pack of wild and exotic cats make their way to where she is laying and I guess you can say they each donated a portion of their nine lives to her, and as a result, she comes back to life with a catlike vengeance.

I watched the whole film just on the off chance that it would get better. Low and behold it just kept getting worse. Don't get me wrong i like Halle Berry but for her even to take a script like this it was obviously the money talking. OK the start of the movie where she happens to save a cats life that was hanging off a balcony and the man whom happens to turn up every second of the movie happened to bear witness to this and thought halle was gonna jump off the balcony, and turns out to fall in love with her straight away. Then a few minutes later halle goes to work and somehow ends up in a totally private and confidential area of her workplace where she witnesses her evil boss conjuring up some ""addictive"" make-up (how corny is that), then she gets shot at by some goons that couldn't shoot at an ""open goal"" from point blank range. Well i suppose halle did do some incredible matrix style dodging of bullets. Then to cut a long story short she ends up on the edge of a cliff where she plunges to her doom, all to be washed ashore where the cat she saved from the balcony gives her mouth to mouth resuscitation. Then low and behold, she turns into catwoman. And yes you guessed it she is now a ""super hero."" Now shes on a mission to avenge her death. Oh yeah the man who thought she was gonna kill herself turns up everywhere she goes, surprise surprise and cant even use his thick head to understand they are the same person, even though there is no difference in looks except a silly black thing covering her eyes.

Half the city are already zombified and killing the other half, and Umbrella Corporation has sealed off the city limits and is planning to ""sanitise"" the area. Hooking up with a rag-tag group of survivors, Jovovich makes a deal with a rogue Umbrella scientist who promises to get them out of town as long as they rescue his missing daughter who's hiding somewhere in the ruins. Meanwhile Umbrella has its own plans for the lovely Miss Milla, involving a seven-foot armour-clad mutant called the Nemesis who's using the infested city as a training ground.

For this movie, however, it's hard to tell... maybe the mediocre attempts at scaring the audience and providing shocks was Anderson's fault, as he wrote the script, but it may be the new director, first-timer Alexander Witt, who's responsible. Let me say this upfront; I, as many others who enjoyed the first, really liked the ending, the whole foreshadowing thing, and, thankfully, the film picks up exactly where the first one left off. Actually, it goes a little further back, to show us exactly what happened before Alice woke up. The plot is decent, about as good as it gets when it's Paul W. S. Anderson writing it. It doesn't drag... heh, it doesn't drag... heck, it doesn't even leave the slightest chance for it to drag, as it's constantly moving. The movie never allows the audience to catch their breath; apparently, someone(I'm guessing Anderson or Witt) has never heard of the danger of overdoing action sequences. For anything (at all) to be good, entertaining, thrilling, whatever... there needs to be what is commonly referred to as 'buffers'. Without those nice little talky-talky scenes in-between, heck, maybe even a dash of good old-fashioned character development, the action just ends up being trite. And that's pretty much what happens here. They try to squeeze as much action into every single frame as possible, and it ends up annoying the audience rather than exciting. The director also has a horrible habit of blurring the image whenever there are more than five zombies on-screen, apparently to (I guess) cover up a bad job on makeup... or something to that effect. If the first had too much make up and such, this has too little. The acting is decent enough. Milla Jovovich gives the same good performance that she usually does. The rest of the cast are acceptable. The characters are mostly clichés and stereotypes. Of course, by mostly I mean almost 90% of the cases. You got the stupid reporter who just wants to make a story out of all of this, despite her being in obvious danger; The bad-ass cop who's suspended but still takes her duty deadly serious; the half-witted pathetic guy who's obviously only there for comic relief... actually, scratch that last one, as he was actually pretty darn funny. For once the person who's supposed to be there for comic relief works, instead of just being the *most*(or even worse; least) laughable character. The special effects were well done, but not spectacular. Definitely not the best I've seen. The action was good, but really over-the-top. The scenes with the Nemesis range between being some of the best action in the movie to being some of the most pathetic and smirk-inspiring scenes. The cinematography is nothing special. The film introduced an unnecessary amount of characters, most of whom are just fodder for the zombies or Nemesis anyway. The showdown between Alice and Nemesis was somewhat pathetically staged, and probably would have seemed out of place, hadn't the rest of the film been of the same quality(honestly, it seemed like a video-game... and while I am quite a big fan of them, I'm considerably more interested in playing them than watching them). That big ol' hunk o' biologically engineered walking death was simultaneously underdeveloped(for what they had him/it do) and overexposed. The film is noisy and loud, but not as loud as the first film, and while the sound is often horribly overdone, it doesn't distract as much as several other big action hits. The film is also less loud when it comes to the soundtrack; it was nice to have some change from the one-note *loud* heavy metal from the first film. All in all, a pretty entertaining flick, but out of your mind much faster than it got in(and that's saying a lot, believe me). If you liked the first, are a big fan of one or more of the actors, or you just have nothing better to do for 90 minutes, give it a shot. It kept me watching through the end, and, despite a few disappointments, kept my interest as well. It just didn't stay fresh in my head for more than about fifteen minutes after the credits started, which is very little for a film with so much going on in it all the time. I recommend it only to big fans of the first or of Milla Jovovich. I suppose big fans of Paul W. S. Anderson(they must exist, somewhere) will probably enjoy it too. I will say that most who liked the first will probably like this as well, but possibly a little less due to the lesser directing. 7/10",2004
1,"Badly scripted, acted and shot. Everything feels really rushed, especially the pacing of the shots... one minute a character is fighting off a zombie, only 3 seconds later he's 40 paces down the street... it seems the director really liked the matrix but had no idea what he was doing... the cut scenes in the video game are better directed.",2005
1,"WOW. I remember the first movie was okay so i decided to see the second one ONLY BECAUSE the trailer made it seem like she was in the same setting as the resident evil 2 video game. The game rocked! Within the first 5 minutes of me watching RE: Apocalypse, I knew it would suck. How crappy was the first scene with those astronauts entering the vault and getting the parasite lose. The movie sucked. Oh my god, i cant stress the fact enough. How is it that you cant shoot one of those licker things in the church with bullets because they dodge them, but the hero of the story can jump off of her motorcycle and crash it into the monster sending both the motorcycle and the monster 100 feet into the air... Then blowing the motorcycle up, a perfectly good vehicle to use during this chaos. This movie was so bad, i thought i was infected with the T-Virus when i had a strange urge to eat the brains of the people next to me in the movie theater... but they wouldn't mind, they were watching the most brainless movie ever.",2005
1,The first RE had a lot going for it.Nice cast.Good fx.Some suspense and general scares.A nice visual style.And a surprise ending that set the stage for a lot of promise to build on toward making one hell of a Horror flick.But a lot of people griped that Re was not like the game enough.Well the bad movie gods heeded their collective whine and have given them what they wanted.While the rest of us are still reeling from this disaster.,2006

9,"This movie is what might happen if you take a typical zombie flick and give it a plot, lot's of action, and a large city with PLENTY of extras to show mobs of zombies. It has humor. It has suspense. And it has a plot that unfolds; even if you've played the games, it's got plenty of changes to keep you guessing. With, I might add, several of the game characters (Jill, Carlos, and the little girl). I enjoyed this movie better than any since Lord of the Rings, Return of the King. Not that you could compare the two. It's just that there haven't been too many good movies since then.",2004
1,"What do you get when you take the greatest survival horror video game series and have a complete idiot(Paul W.S. Anderson) put it into a movie? if you answered a god awful movie your right. RE:Apocalypse is a complete mess for several reasons. 1:Thier's no story to back any of this mindless zombie blasting up. 2:Thier's no character development at all you don't care if any one in this movie dies because you don't know what makes them important. And 3: Overall this movie is no where near as good as any of the games. RE:Apocalypse tries to trick you that it'll be a good movie with characters from the game. But any resident evil game fan well quickly realize that it was a pathetic excuse for there money. Overall if your a zombie movie fan avoid this and see the Dawn Of The Dead remake or 28 days later, If your a resident evil fan it might be worth a rental I guess if you liked the first one. Anyone else watch something else because anything beats watching this crap for the next 90 minutes.",2005
9,"**PLEASE NOTE THIS COMMENT MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS TO THE FIRST RESIDENT EVIL** After watching the first Resident Evil I knew that the there would be a sequel but I thought Nemesis will jump out of nowhere and Alice will start shooting him with her shotgun because Matt was infected & he was put into the Nemesis program. At the start they showed what happened in Racoon city before Alice woke up in the Hospital, which was sensible and the first appearance of Nemesis was so cool when he wiped out the S.T.A.R.S team. My most favourite scene in the film is when Alice was running down the building. In the second part they went a lot deeper into the T-Virus & it was a bit confusing but in the first it was very straightforward. The whole film is very similar to Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, the scene where Alice was running across the building while the helicopter was trying to shoot her and when she was cornered she dropped her gun & caught it before it hit the floor was taken from the game Resident Evil: Code Veronica X. Overall it's quite good but not better than the first and I'm looking forward to the third installment Resident Evil: Extinction I hope that also turns out to be good.",2007
6,"I liked the first movie, it was good average entertainment. I think this one is slightly better than the first, mainly because this one is scarier. I admit i preferred the zombies in the Dawn of the dead remake but thats because they were fast. The script is no great shakes, the cast are OK. Though the bad guy seemed like he was doing a poor man's Schindler. The FX was fairly decent and the movie never becomes boring, it's too fast paced for that. Some of the sets were obviously based on the games. At least it made me jump out of my seat a few times. Needless to say a third one seems very likely but i like where there going with one scene reminding me of Brian De Palma's The Fury. 6 out of 10",2004
1,"Resident Evil: Apocalypse 1/2 Star I Agree with the user comments on IMDb and Roger Ebert, this movie is so shallow and the characters are pathetic, the effects are terrible, the acting is horrible and everything else about this movie is just the same usual zombie thing that 28 Days later, Dawn of the dead and many others have been doing for more years that I Could imagine.",2005
9,"I haven't laughed that hard at a movie in a long time. Being a fan of White Castle and the talents of John Cho and Kal Penn, this movie was a sure fire hit. Normally I would think a script about two stoners on a quest for White Castle sliders would be boring, if not retarded, material... but this movie just works. ",2004
9,"""Harold And Kumar Go To White Castle"" is an amusing, hilarious comedy not to be taken too seriously and not to be dismissed as just another silly stoner comedy. Certainly there are plenty of elements which appeal to those dophamine, ""good times"" movie-goers, yet there are also some classic instances of comedic greatness. Aside from chronicling two inane potheads on a quest to satisfy their appetites, ""White Castle"" offers a great coming-of-age and funny coincidence premise, which reminds us of the heavy, sadistic curveballs life hurls at us, sometimes when we merely desire something simple and cannot attain it. Here is a story of a simple goal by two simple minds: to find a White Castle hamburger joint and fulfill the lasting effects of ""the munchies"". Yet, as these two stoner friends come to realize, even the seemingly simplest of goals in life can be impossible to achieve, due to such disturbances as irony, circumstance, error, and misfortune, as they are all encountered in this journey. The comic elements are listless: stoner instinct-gone horribly awry, catastrophic error, not-so-pleasant raunchy surprise, near-death escapes in the most unlikeliest of ways, and the eventual finesse of overcoming all obstacles to finally enjoy a binge at a hamburger joint. This is a fresh, original, and satisfying comedy, and though it is nothing of a brilliant production or a cinematic masterpiece, there are plenty of the elements here which constitute for a barrel of laughs and a genuinely entertaining experience at the movies. ***1/2 out of ****",2004
8,"With the title ""Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle"", how can one not see this movie? Well, one could, and would be missing a very funny movie. H&R is genius creative marketing, and the director Danny Leiner's movie is actually funnier than it's trailer. The movie demographic is probably from 15 to 25-- totally not mine. Written by Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg, the story is more hit than miss, with inspired moments and a drugged out cool. Consequently, the humor can be gross out bathroom humor. However, ""Harold & Kumar"" can be clever funny, and has moments of comic genius. In the beginning, Kumar(Kal Penn) is having a medical school interview, and the dean (a classically clueless Fred Ward) asks him why he isn't already in school with his perfect MCAT scores. Kumar says, ""Just because you're hung like moose, doesn't mean you have to do porn."" I was rolling. John Cho and Kal Penn as Harold and Kumar have a natural chemistry and are completely charming. Cho and Penn overcome much of the movie's inconsistencies. ",2004
10,"The movie is absolutely hilarious. It's light years beyond Dude Where's My Car?, or for that matter any stoner/dumbass flick I've seen in years. This will be a cult comedy classic, one you watch ten times till you know all the words. ",2004
10,"It is no exaggeration or flattery when I say this movie is the funniest  movie I have ever seen. I haven't laughed so much at a movie since....  never, seeing how this is the funniest movie I have ever seen.  What a great combination, a Korean guy and an Indian guy, both  stereotypically known to be intellectually advanced. What was great  about this movie was that they tackled modern day stereotypes and  showed the stupidity in exploiting them. Also it showed the other side  to these two minorities which is usually purposely ignored.   This movie, as you see from the trailer, is about two guys who have the  munchies and all they want is to go get some White Castle fast food.  But this movie does not fall in the same category as Half Baked or How  High; this is not another typical stoner film. It does not base its  humor solely the idea of getting high, this movie is able to find humor  in more then just that. Take the best comedic part of every movie you  have ever seen and just combine them all together to make this one  hilarious film.  I personally, being Indian found much humor in this movie, along with  something else, a little pride in the fact that this movie did not  portray the lead Indian guy to be just another book worm with a heavy  accent. I really enjoyed this film. Definitely worth a second, a third,  and fourth watch, and then some. Don't worry my not so Indian, white  friend, sitting next to me, got just as much a kick out of it as well.  I don't know how many times I have to say it for it to sink it, but one  last time, this movie is the funniest movie I have ever seen, it is  hilarious!",2004
8,"Yes this film is rude, crude, over the top, full of choppy editing (probably to ensure an R not NC-17)and sometimes cliché', but it works. Yes there is plenty of Drug Humor and sex humor, but the funniest stuff is actually the on going humor involved with racial inequality and characters who learn how to break those typifications because of their symbolic journey to White Castle. This film pushes the line between being too crude and sometimes too smart for it's own good. The Acting is Right on from the 2 leads and there are quite a bit of funny cameos.",2004
10,"This movie was absolutely great. I've watched it about 5 times now over the past few weeks. For all those that love The Big Lebowski, this movie will make a lot of sense. There are loads and loads of memorable lines in the film. Even more interesting was the interesting metaphors about race relations, immigration and assimilation in the US. It seems to me that White Castle (not, in my view, randomly selected as the munchie destination of choice) represented that idealized destination that all those pursuing happiness and the American Dream seek out. A telling moment is where Harold and Kumar, before getting to White Castle, see their Jewish friends Goldstein and Rosenberg happily enjoying their hotdogs in another fast food joint. They gaze longingly at their two friends and Harold says ""I want what they have"". He elaborates that he means having exactly what you want, not hot dogs per se. You could argue that this was a metaphor for Asian-American and Indian-American first or second generation immigrants looking to Jewish-Americans as examples of a group that came to the US and managed to be admitted to the ""White Castle"", to assimilate and to ultimately attain the American Dream. I could be way off about this, but it's clear that immigration, assimilation and race-relations is a prominent theme throughout the film. Bottom line, the film is both hilarious, meaningful, and memorable.",2005
10,"This was a hilarious movie. Unlike How High, where Method Man and Redman try so hard to be the heir apparent to Cheech and Chong, Harold and Kumar just seem to fall into that role. I thought I was going to die laughing when Kumar was peeing in the bushes and Jamie Kennedy came up to him. Doogie Howser stealing their car, humping their seat. That's classic.",2005
8,"Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle, in 2004 just from the title, I never wanted to see this movie, it just sounded so incredibly stupid and a waste of good film. But on Bravo a few months ago they had this movie on it's top 100 funniest films of all time and also they're not releasing the new sequel in a month, so I figured what do I have to loose? Just go ahead and give the movie a chance, so I rented it yesterday and watched it today, I hate to say it, I couldn't stop laughing. I mean from beginning to end this movie is just so unbelievably funny, I think it's because it doesn't take itself seriously and the actors just have so much fun with it. Kenn Pal and John Cho have a great chemistry for the buddy relationship of Harold and Kumar, not since Bill and Ted has been such a great stoner move.",2008
10,"This movie is everything for drugs that Dude Where's My Car should have been for beer. The producers of that movie came back and brought us this timeless classic that I'm sure will be watched for generations.

If you think drug humor is funny then you don't even have to read any more of this review go watch to movie now if you haven't seen it. I guarantee you won't be let down. However if you think drugs are bad and stupid, this movie still might be funny to you. This is on my list of top favorite movies if not it being my favorite movie to date. It's hard to even discuss this movie because I feel like I don't want to ruin the experience for anybody, and If anybody is reading this comments before checking off hide spoilers I think you should click the X button on your computer and go grab this hilarious movie.

Don't start watching without having any burgers on hand.,2005

I can't think of another comedy that I have seen in recent years that even compares to Harold and Kumar. Throughout the movie, there is not a scene where you're not holding back a shout of laughter, or biting back a guffaw. I can't think of anything in this movie that is a downer. It is truly and feel-good, hilarious comedy. Not to mention a HUGE boost in White Castle business. ;) I know I plan on stopping by my local White Castle and picking up a bunch of Sliders. Overall, Harold and Kumar go to White Castle is a must-see.. TWICE !! (.. okay four times.)",2004

7,"One thing can be certain; people who did not enjoy this film either are to `PC' or have not embraced the concept of mindless humor.  This is with out a doubt the new Airplane of the new millennium where racial comedy and the `you can't say that attitude' are left by the way side so we can watch two friends in a campy adventure.  John Cho and Kal Penn have excellent screen presence and their ability to play off of one another is what gave them staying power through all three pie moves.  One of the best parts about this film is the cameo appearances and tie-ins to motion pictures of the age and cult following.  Leaving no gender, race, or stereo-type out the film rages with reckless abandon on the audience and with in moments you find your self laughing through your hand covered mouth and by the end of the second real you can't help but laugh aloud.  Danny Leiner is great at telling this story with honesty to the characters and not letting even their own epiphanies stand in the way.  Not to mention Neil Patrick Harris' performance epitomizing the child actor gone bye, bye.  This is an honestly funny film with very little to think about, pushing the social limit on the `PC' attitude.",2004

I mean sure been there done that... but than it goes in to this huge adventure! its like two smart people that don't have a problem going to white castle at 1 am at age 22 even though their genius's. and they end up doing more than a kid studying at home could ever dream of. its like the ultimate stoner trip, in the words of Kumar, it really is the American dream.

It is a film that speaks to an entire generation. 1947's ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" spoke to our grandparents. ""The Graduate"" spoke to our parents. ""Fight Club"" spoke to our older brothers working dead-end jobs in the 90's. But it is with the arrival of ""Garden State"" that our generation is spoken to, those of us born in the early-mid 80's who are in our late teens and early twenties trying to make it by in a environment that seems all at once to strange and yet so familiar.",2004

To me it was real life on film, and within that real life there are very different people. Unfortunately not everyone wants to see movies that remind them of reality, and I guess not everybodies reality is the same as mine.

Besides that this movie overwhelmingly surprised me with its directing and acting. Natatlie Portman did an amazing job playing Sam. She really worked the part. Zach Braff's directing debut is stunning. I had never heard of Braff except for his character on the TV show Scrubs. He also did an excellent job acting. There were so many surprising elements thrown out during the movie. Braff just kept piling one thing on top of the next to make the story more interesting as it rolled on. I was very pleased with Garden State!!!!!!!!!11,2004
1,"Wave after wave of directionless nausea - this film wants and at first promises to be quirky and original but is in fact obvious, solipsistic and mired in cliché-driven dialogue which builds to a crecendo of awfulness and cheese by the end. Throughout the film we meet supposedly off the wall characters, who are actually very dull, and just don't quite work and who clunk through the horrific screenplay like men in armour suits, driving jeeps through mansion houses and spouting preppy existential obviousness accompanied by the whinings of Coldplay. The film has occasional funny episodes, often no funnier than a dog playing with its genitals, which happened twice (an index of the slapstick, rudimentary humour of the film in general) but by the end, the film falls into an 'infinite abyss' of complete detritus and the director's egocentric ramblings which made me want to gouge my eyes out.

1,"Garden State must rate amongst the most contrived and pretentious films of all time. The plot is a simple one, involving a young man returning home after his mother's death and discovering love. But really, the plot isn't important. What is important to Zach Braff - writer, director, and star  is that he is able to hang from the plot all the necessary accoutrements of an 'indie' or 'arty' film. We therefore are presented with endless cute and quirky characters and scenes that don't exist for reasons of plot or character development, but simply to give some artistic credibility to the film (à la Wes Anderson - or so Braff hopes). Unfortunately and somewhat astonishingly, Braff has not only fooled many on IMDb, but also some critics who really ought to have known better.",2005
1,"Garden State was a mediocre film at best. The film seems more like a compilation of thoughts that the writer (Zach Braff) had, rather than a cohesive story. The disjointed plot may have been more engaging if it weren't interspersed with pointless scenes that were nothing more than ""quirky."" Coincidentally these scenes are often the ones that are relayed in conversation (Zack walking past faucets that turn on as he passes, crazy under-cranked party scene, shouting over a gorge, the list goes on).",2005

The main character and all his friends are the kind of people that would make you leave the room in real life - boring, self-absorbed, low self esteem, and sleazy. The hero climaxes three times - pun intended. First he tells off his father - but the set up is contrived. His father is conveniently the fall guy for the hero's own nothing life. Then he cruelly leaves the adorable girl for his nothing life in CA. Then he returns to the adorable girl. Duh, he is nothing without her. Sorry for the hackneyed phase, 'nohing without her' but his life up to that point has been a zero.",2006

Whilst the acting was good and the soundtrack was very hip, the script was full of self important lines and the whole movie left me wondering why they had bothered.",2005
1,"""Garden State"" takes bandwagon to a whole another level. This movie is the biggest disappointment of the year. 'Garden State"" is crappy in so many ways that I don't even know where to start. The trailer I saw in March was ten thousand times better than this pathetic dribble pawned off as a movie. Like, seriously, do you think Braff had enough clichéd characters? Oh, and not to mention the in your face symbolism...how dumb did he expect his audience to be? I got it during the ""we get high together"" mother/son scene, Andrew craved a loving family...the Noah's Ark family was so not needed.",2004
1,"I don't think I've ever wanted to put my fist through a TV before, but i came very damn close watching this movie.",2005
2,"""Garden State"" is another of these ""indie""-type pictures that supposedly skimp on production values for the sake of giving the audience some real true-to-life human drama. Oddly enough, the production is very good, so are the performances (by some fairly big-name actors as well). Where the picture is lacking is in Zach Braff's script, which seems mostly culled from situations taken from other movies.",2005
6,"Perhaps the most notable and visible issue with this film is the narrative structure. The writing is done in a sort of encounter-to-encounter style, like a layman's Odyssey. I feel though that this is not a result of a specific film styling but rather poor writing on the part of Zach Braff, who, mind you, is not the Epstein brothers (of Casablanca fame) but rather a TV actor who is breaking into the big screen for the first time. As a result, plot weaving becomes non-existent, and character development, even in the case of Large (the main character) is shallow and doesn't really show much change, or rather, the script doesn't provide an opportunity for change. When he then has an epiphany at the end of the film, a terribly contrived moment, he praddles off everything that he already knew as if it were terribly profound, and the moment entirely misses.",2004
10,GARDEN STATE a film by Zach Braff.,2004
1,"The fact that the movie made only 26 mil in 26 weeks clearly shows how poorly it was written. This, of course, is a common problem with actor ego projects. The story has many unnecessary scenes that don't connect or contribute at all to the story or characters but are thrown in for the sake of getting a cheap laugh - like the knight in the kitchen and the fast motion party scenes. The entire film is full of extra meaningless shots and scenes that could easily be and should have been cut. Why should we care about this character? The film contains virtually no conflict or drama, or emotion, or humor, or cleverness or originality. We have no reason to care one way or the other about Graff. Other than the girlfriend, who is well written, everyone else is straight out of a bad college student film, as are most of the scenes and the story in general. The movie was so concerned with trying to be anti-Hollywood that it failed to be anything else but that. There is virtually no story here, just style in place of substance, and the style isn't even new or different - rather straight from the 70s. So if you're a college student longing for the old days of the 60s & 70s, you'll really enjoy this film. For the rest of the world - well, Nepolion Dynamite made almost double the box office and that wasn't so great either, but at least it was original.",2005
1,"It's very rare that I come away from a film feeling that it had absolutely no redeeming features. I can however say with all certainty that this is definitely one of them. It's got a horrible 'trendy' soundtrack, rubbish characters (Portman is irritating beyond belief) and I just can't understand why it even exists. I don't mind a love story; I like subtle ones as well as the cheesy stuff, but this is just useless. I'm sure some readers of the Guardian (lefty UK newspaper) will enjoy it, but that's by no means a recommendation...",2006

7,"I was torn while watching Bourne Supremacy. I'll just go ahead and say this before I mislead. I loved this movie! Unfortunately one key aspect just about dragged this film under the water. The camera was far too unstable. It was obviously done intentionally by design choice, but it was excessively overdone. Through action scenes that had you at the edge of your seat, you'd just come to realize that you were only trying to see what the heck was going on. This made these scenes a little hard to enjoy. But not only was it the action scenes; even during quiet still scenes the camera would always seem to be moving, and eventually was giving me a headache. Just to serve as a warning, it's pretty much like that throughout most of the movie, so brace yourself for an adventure of epileptic proportions.",2005
8,"The Bourne Identity was one of those films that some people will love for being different to the average action film, but others will hate for it daring to be 'too' different. Unlike the majority of action movies before it, the first Bourne film, despite having stunts and explosions never put it's emphasis on them, as the focus was always on the central characters and their use of brains, rather than brawn to accomplish their goals. The sequel is basically more of the same, but it's a welcome return in my opinion, as cinema needs films that are different to the majority. It's also a good thing as I'm a big fan of Matt Damon. It's unfair that he should continue to get lumped in with Ben Afleck due to their friendship as he has a lot of talent and I think that the fact he's gone for more art orientated films as opposed to the dumb blockbusters his friend was drawn to like a moth to the light shows that he has a genuine respect for cinema. He stars as the title character; Jason Bourne, who, like the film itself is hardly your average action fare. He doesn't utter one liners shortly before or after blowing someone away, nor does he spend most of the movie trying to look cool; espionage is the order of the day and it works very well in the context of the film.",2004
10,"The Bourne Supremacy is the sequel to the successful Bourne Identity spy thriller. This movie, directed by a new director, is given a different yet extremely exciting feel to it. The casting is still great, with Matt Damon bringing a deadpan portrayal to the Bourne character. Hes very good in this role, which commits a great success to the whole of the movie. Supporting players Brian Cox and Julia Styles, along with newcomer Joan Allen, all provide stellar support for Bourne. The action is intense and really well done, and the plot is thrilling and will surprise you quite a bit. The camera-work is extremely fast paced, and overall it has a gritty, captivating style. With all of these elements together, you got one great action thriller that in many cases even surpasses Identity! Movies like this are hard to come by, in todays times with many action pictures that just don't work and become tedious. Ill give this near perfect- *** and 1/2 outs 4 Star's- definitely see The Bourne Identity before this- don't fret: you will be very entertained.",2005

9,After seeing 'The Bourne Identity' two things were clear to me.,2004
10,"An outstanding sequel to ""The Bourne Identity,"" this movie has a lot of what I like: interesting European scenery, an involving storyline of a man being pursued throughout the film; fun action scenes and very little profanity. Plus, some great actors. Man, there's a lot to like in this film!",2005
8,"Oh man, I say The Bourne Supremacy is much more thrilling than the first one. The first one was like an introduction of Bourne and now since we know the character, it is left with solid story and thrilled feeling after watching.",2005
8,"This is a superior action film with the added bonus of good acting by Joan Allen, Matt Damon, and Karl Urban among others. The camera work is amazing.",2004
9,"Reading up about the Bourne movies,the era which I found to receive the most praise was when director Paul Greengrass took over the series. Finding the first one to be a brilliant mix of blockbuster thrills and Spiv espionage,I decided to cut into the supreme second offering in the series.",2016
8,"Story line and cinematography both very complicated. A lot of thought was put into the story and the cinematography. I've never had trouble following a movie with my eyes but this one challenged me to the limit. The camera moves so fast during the chasing/fighting scenes that the images are blurred, the cameras shake frequently (cameras mounted in the cars as they hit bumps or other cars or take turns at high speeds), the cameras aren't centered, the images are too close. Sometimes the film pans in 3-4 different directions/angles within 1-2 seconds. That's how rapid the camera is. The first thirty minutes of the movie I didn't know what was happening because there was so much information being thrown out and I was ready to not go any further. I couldn't piece together who was who. The CIA agents were talking so fast and soft that I couldn't understand them. Bourne has the CIA hunting him, Germans hunting him, and Russians hunting him. You have a Russian agent in Tangiers who tries to kill him, CIA agents killing each other and Bourne tracks an unknown agent in Germany and kills him. I didn't believe one fight scene where Damon loses his gun and picks up a rolled-up magazine and starts beating this agent to a pulp with it. Hollywood. And when Damon breaks into an apartment or hotel room he knows exactly where everything is: the circuit breaker, the gas line, computer hard drives, etc. (I suppose that's done to save time). Then things started making a little more sense. The film uses flashbacks to help piece together some of the unknowns. The car chase scenes are really fantastic in this movie (if only the editing was more discernible). There is a long tunnel chase/crash scene which is the best I've ever seen. (You literally have to grab something during this scene because the drivers are so close to killing themselves). The stunt drivers in this movie really earned their pay. There are a couple real clever twists that happen in this movie. The music is very well done, it accentuates the scenes very well: not over-powering but not boring, either. Matt Damon did a great job although his involvement was not as active as the first Bourne movie: much of the movie centered around the CIA. Damon can play tough guys without coming off too strong like a Stallone or a Sean Penn which is refreshing. The ending was really good. I suppose that's it for the Bourne series, he has been vindicated. If you are elderly and have trouble focusing your eyes you will not be able to follow this movie. Bourne #1 was a better movie because it was easier to follow but Bourne Supremacy is unlike so many other Hollywood movies that it's a must see.",2005
8,"A supremacy over the Bond franchise, increasingly. Matt Damon reprises an impressive, convincing delivery of a role well executed the first time around. Dalton's efforts come closest, alas within the insuperable cage of audience/exec. production expectation (and reasonably so, I might add).",2004
8,"The Bourne Supremacy is a very entertaining action movie and even though it feels and looks like the original its still a great sequel. In The Bourne Identity, sleeper agent/assassin Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) went on the run from his own agency, the CIA, when they tried to take him out of commission. Although he thought his troubles were over, he is forced back into the life when he is framed for a botched CIA operation, so he takes the fight back to them while trying to find out more about his past and the memories that haunt him. The plot is very good and it is carried out well by a talented cast. The film keeps you on the edge of your seat and you most likely won't be bored. The best new addition to the cast is Joan Allen and she gives a really good performance. Matt Damon is once again Jason Bourne and he gives a great performance. Brian Cox is also back and I like him this time around because he dies and you don't have to deal with him anymore. The last main part of the cast is Julia Stiles and she may actually have a future ahead of her in Hollywood. Paul Greengrass directs and he does a good job of replacing Doug Liman. The direction is really good and it keeps its audience interested and it keeps you guessing right until the end. Some people will complain that there's nothing new and its not worth the time to watch but its a lot more exciting then the original. Rating 8/10 a nearly flawless action movie that improves over the original. I recommend you see this movie it won't disappoint you.",2005
8,"When we left Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) at the end of the previous film, The Bourne Identity (2002), he had managed to out-think and out- fight the CIA operatives gunning for his head, and had seemingly found a happy ending for himself in Goa, India with his girlfriend Marie (Franka Potente). But the laws of franchise film-making mean that the shady types hunting him down the last time still want him dead to tie off any loose ends, and Bourne must again use his CIA- trained super-soldier skills to escape anything coming his way. Dumping director Doug Liman turned out to be the wisest choice the producers made. No disrespect to Liman - Identity was a well-made film - but the hiring of Brit Paul Greengrass took the series to a whole new level.",2016
9,"Paul Greengrass took over the helm from Doug Liman, and ""The Bourne Supremacy"" is just as action packed, but Green grass clearly takes things to a higher level. The budget on this sequel stands out as we rejoin Bourne and his girlfriend Marie (Franka Potente of ""Run Lola Run"") living off the grid in India. Things rapidly change in paradise as a Moscow Secret Service agent (Karl Urban of ""Doom"") ferrets our hero out and goes gunning for him and ends up killing his girlfriend. As it turns out, Some sneaky Russians have broken up a CIA rendezvous and killed two agents.Furthermore, they have framed Jason Bourne for the homicides. CIA bigwigs Pamela Landy (Joan Allen of ""Face/Off"") and Ward Abbott (Brian Cox of ""Troy"") pack it off to Berlin after Bourne turns up suddenly in Naples and surprises everybody. Landry brings in Nicky (Julia Stiles of (""10 Things I Hate About You"") to help figure out Bourne's next move. The fight scenes are strong and the no-holds-barred chase scene in Moscow is one of the best. Damon turns in a robust performance as the tight-lipped, quick-thinking Bourne who manages to stay a jump ahead of his adversaries, but he is by no means means indestructible, and he displays some sympathy. Cox is a slimy villAin who kills his own without a qualms.",2016

7,"THE BOURNE SUPREMACY (3+ outta 5 stars) Nifty follow-up to ""The Bourne Identity"", one of the best action-thrillers to come out in recent years. Even though these movies don't skimp on excitement they also provide plenty of story and character development so that you don't feel you're being bombarded with one idiotic action sequence after another. The storyline isn't quite as gripping as the first... at times it seems to be just repeating itself... but ultimately the movie proves itself to be a worthy successor, thanks to the performances (Matt Damon as Bourne, Brian Cox as the head of a super-secret US spy agency... and the addition of Joan Allen as a determined investigator determined to track down and neutralize Bourne). Franka Potente doesn't have as much to do this time around... but Julia Stiles gets one especially intense scene that shows off her acting skills to the max. Yes, when you get right down to it the movie has a sense of ""been there, done that"" about it... but not very often are movies of this type done with this kind of skill and dedication... spy movies haven't been this cool since the '60s.",2005
6,"While definitely an engaging film that had me enthralled, The Bourne Supremacy is missing a key element that made The Bourne Identity such a great action film. That element was the bold decision to kill Franka Potentate's character in the first Act of the film. In Identity, Potentate gave a nice balance of humanity to Jason Bourne's character. The contrast between the cold blooded killing tactics and the warmth and awkwardness that Damon shows in his scenes with Potentate lent great sympathy and likability to him. By eliminating Potentate, Bourne loses that important balance that instead leans towards his brutal side. To make up for it, the Director decides to add on a cheesy ending with Bourne and the daughter of his victims.",2005
7,"Greetings again from the darkness. I am a huge fan of the first Bourne movie and am now throughly convinced that Matt Damon was truly born to be Bourne. He has always appeared uncomfortable with being an actor (and definitely with being a movie star), so playing Jason Bourne is the perfect match. Bourne is uncomfortable, though, exceptional in most situations whether kicking the crap out of airport security or driving a cool little jeep through the streets of India. Bourne #2 delivers this exciting character into a world where both sides are against him - even his own side.",2004
8,"The first movie left the plot of the book about half way through the movie. I only read about 1/4 of the second book, but it looks like they didn't follow much of it all. Not that there's anything wrong with that. The story picks up 2 years later and Jason and Marie are hiding out in India. Jason has been framed (like the book only it's a different murder) and also targeted for kill by the guy who framed him (I'm not sure why they decided to frame him and then kill him..). Anyway the movie takes off when he goes into Bourne mode and kicks but doing his super spy stuff (which is the best parts of the movie). The must have been problems shooting the chase scenes because the dam camera jumping all over the place was driving me nuts. Hey may say it's for dramatic effect, I say it's because if you don't shoot the scene well you can't be edit it into a dramatic one. I don't know. Anyway the plot was good and the character Pamela Landy reminds me of Harvey Keitel in Thelma and Louise. I suppose they will complete make a new plot for the next movie and call it the ""Bourne Ultimatum"" and not follow any of the third book. Not that there's anything wrong with that. 8/10 (would have been 9/10 if the chase scenes were not so camera jumpy).",2004
8,"This film was surprisingly satisfying for a sequel, in fact it could probably stand alone, as there is plenty of background provided throughout the film. Although the plot line is a little cliché (ex-spy tries to settle down with girl, spy's old boss kills girl, ex-spy seeks revenge), the way Bourne is depicted is surprisingly realistic, which is in keeping with the original film, Bourne Identity. He doesn't manage to keep it together the way characters such as his often do. He is shown throughout the film as unstable, which gives us continuity from the previous film, and allows us to relate to him more than characters like James Bond, for example. Compared to the regular action man, Bourne is innocence one minute, murder the next, a deeply flawed, guilt-tripped, nervous wreck with a smooth finish, making him both identifiable and undefinable with his complexity. The other characters in the film are also well portrayed, Nicky reacts perfectly to encountering a human killing machine, Pamela Landy is both tough and vulnerable when dealing with Bourne, Krill, the Russian assassin, is cold and calculating to the end, and Ward Abbott's eventual suicide was surprising yet appropriate for the classic good-guy-turns-out-to-be-bad villain.",2011
10,"I knew that a Bourne sequel would deserve its predecessor, and here it is! I knew how well the preceding Bourne movie had worked well, and this oneis indeed a pretty decent movieit is way more decent, it's spectacularly far better than the preceding one. This is so much unexpected indeed for most sequel-prone movies, where the crew behind usually lose their talent to infuse more creative layer for sequels, but this one is totally different! I never expect how well they manage to elevate the quality and standing of the movie. Bourne Supremacy continues with Jason Bourne, after quite sorting out things in his past in the first movie he come to live in peace with her girlfriend (whom he met throughout his retracing journey in Bourne Identity) Marie Kreutz (Franka Potente) in India. However some of those use to poison CIA by letting an ambushed operation of them, manage to let Jason Bourne's identity held responsible thus endangering his life (and his girlfriend as well) once again. The first few minutes of the movie was indeed a mix of thrill, resentment and lament, but when it continues so are our surprises continues as well. Paul Greengrass has indeed a lot of aptitude to heave this movie into an exceptionally brilliant movie.",2008

10,"I'm a history teacher so I'm very critical of adaptations, especially those that sentimentalize the past in any way. This is a superb rendering of the spirit of the industrial age and the many facets of class struggle within it. It's also a richly romantic love story. The acting by all the cast is uniformly excellent but Richard Armitage as Thornton is a stand-out. The BBC is well-known for their meticulous attention to detail with locations and costumes. The working 19C mills used in the film are like watching a Jacob Riis photograph springing to life. The cinematography is gorgeous and the music is outstanding. This is the best historic fiction on screen I've ever seen.",2005
10,"North and South took me completely by surprise when it was aired on BBC America. I was flipping through channels and thought I was going to be tuning into the American version based on the John Jakes novels. But Elizabeth Gaskell's work on which the film is based is far more than a mere period romance. This is social commentary and a love story, the struggle of workers and masters/managers as well as the misunderstanding of the intellectuals that forms a triangle in the film that is still alive today. The lead characters all take on a social conscience that grows with their love for each other to an understanding of the different worlds that lived together in this time of radical change. But the true success of the film lies in the actors abilities to show the true emotion and change that takes place around them and in them during the course of the tale. It is unfortunate that the BBCA chose to cut out so much of the film and hopefully the DVD will be available soon for US viewers to force others into watching. A true diamond being lost in the rough. Do yourselves a favor and sit back and enjoy the excellent acting and story, then sit back and watch it again and take note of all the layers of social history being shown. Or just to watch Richard Armitage ;), sooooo good!",2005
10,"Just what you need for a cold winter Sunday night! It's nice to have something to really get into, but the 4 weeks it was on went way too fast! The sets, costumes and acting were excellent, especially Richard Armitage's performance as mill owner John Thornton. He's got a brilliant deep, brooding sort of look about him, but with a softer, kind side too that is gradually revealed as the story goes on. The way Richard Armitage portrayed these two sides of Thornton's character was amazing. And as well as being a great actor, he's also very, very good looking! Nice smile (though we don't see it very often - so it's lucky he looks good when being moody/troubled!!)and a lovely voice. (sounds a bit like Sean Bean as a matter of fact!) Oh I'm going to miss this series! But honestly, not just because of Mr Thornton; it really was a gripping story and a great drama. The music was brilliant too, really capturing the mood and feel of the dark, industrial setting.",2004
10,Excellent rendition of Elizabeth Gaskells book.,2005
9,"Elizabeth Gaskell may have invented the concept of the North/South divide in British society - some commentators think so. The adaptation of her novel makes it clear that although the North is viewed as a scary place for young Margaret Hale as she is forced to move there, she eventually falls in love with the working people she meets and with a mill owner, John Thornton, played movingly by Richard Armitage. I hope that people will find the social message of Gaskell's story relevant for today even though many viewers will be caught up in the central love story. The story deals with the infancy of the trade union movement and for those of us who had ancestors in the cotton industry, is very important in its portrayal of the dangerous working conditions. Reading the book is well worth the effort because it provides more insight in to the motivations of the characters and explains why they eventually grow to love each other. This is a very enjoyable TV drama and is worth repeating - hopefully the BBC will do so!",2004

10,"With ""North and South"" the BBC has continued its fine tradition of producing great adaptations. Indeed ""North and South"" is one of the very best the BBC has done, capturing the nuances of the novel perfectly and bringing out the latent eroticism of the book. The only quibble is the way the screenwriter has changed the ending from that of the novel. Although this will irk some, I thought the new ending was in keeping with the story as a whole. The acting throughout is superb, especially from Richard Armitage as the brooding Mr Thornton - he captures exactly the character's pride, brutality, warmth and passion. I think Richard Armitage would be a very good James Bond.",2005

However, the one big criticism I have is it takes SOOOOOO long to get the great British dramas here. This wonderful adaptation of a book that I lovingly studied at University, has yet to be aired here on terrestrial television and, knowing the standard of TV we get here, I doubt it will air...the best I can hope for is the SKY Channel UK TV. No sign of it yet.... Still, I saw the DVD in my local library and hired it for a dollar for the week ( thats 33p to you UK dwellers - not bad huh?!) And so that is how I come to be writing these comments.",2006

This is the best thing the BBC have put on TV for years and I cant wait until it comes out on DVD in April. It has made me read the book which is as good as the dramatisation. Your heart went out to the poor families and in some placers it made me cry. Magret Hale and John Thornton do not immediately get on but go through a mixture of her disliking him, to his refused proposal, to their eventual love at the end. This was well acted with wonderful musical additions. The show was widely applauded.",2004
10,"I had never read this book, but enjoy watching period dramas. I'm going to read the book now. I got into this in the first episode and I was gripped all the way through. I was rooting for Margaret and John to get together as it just had got to happen. Great portrayals by Sinead Cusack as John Thornton's mother and Jo Joyner as sister Fanny, she was funny. Brendan Coyle was great as Nicholas Higgins, showing us the worker's side of the story and what the unions were trying to do. Very believable acting from Richard Armitage as John Thornton and Daniela Denby-Ashe was lovely as Margaret. Thornton reminds me of similar sort of characters - Mr Rochester, Darcy. We need men like that.",2004

The movie preserves Gaskell's depiction of Northern England during the Industrial Revolution, and captures the suffering, industry's affects on ""Milton"", as well as hope and the daily struggles of the factory workers. However, in maintaining the gloomy 19th-Century atmosphere, the movie does not appear stuffy or superficial.",2005

I've probably seen far too many BBC costume dramas, but we were both gripped immediately and watched the whole thing in one sitting - all four hours.

Mr. Armitage breathes fiery life into this magnificent character, in turn creating for himself a legion of adoring fans around the world, demanding the release of a DVD by the BBC. Aided by an excellent cast, the story unfolds in a mesmerizing and totally addictive manner, with an unforgettable soundtrack, drawing the viewer back again and again to relive the experience. You will not be disappointed in this movie.",2005

8,"Very good period drama that BBC can always be expected to produce. I've never read the book but like most adaptations, i'm going to soon! I absolutely adored this TV mini-series! The first two episodes were so bleak and John Thorton was an absolute git! But sure enough, Margret left an impression and the better side of his nature shone through! The ending was so romantic is right up there with my other favourite BBC adaptation 'Pride and Prejudice.' The delicate and unexperienced kiss so full of love just had me grinning inanely - so romantic! *happy sigh* I agree one-hundred per cent with the other reviewer - Thorton did remind me of Mr. Darcy but we do need more men like that! If you want a drama that mixes historical facts (the development of workers union) and the personal journey of a young women (Margret Hale played by the lovely Daniela Denby-Ashe who has such gorgeous facial expressions) with a splash of romance then 'North and South' is definitely for you!!",2005

10,"This very good adaption tells a story set in Victorian England but it's issues are still relevant today and all over the world. First of all there are the misunderstandings between the new and old citizens . The new comers are from the south and the city is in the north. Nowadays we have new comers from India ( we in Holland have them from Morocco and Turkey)and we all have problems with communication between the two groups. Secondly there are the deplorable working conditions in the factories and we see how many of their owners hardly care for the people. First they were the slaves ( well... almost ) of the rich - as farmers or servants, then they became the slaves of the factory owners ( and if we are not carefuller we will now become the slaves of the 24 hour economy). This all is told in the form of a love story and that works very well to bring those issues to the attention to people who would not be interested had it been told in a too grim a manner. Our admiration must go to the writer, Elizabeth Gaskell.

10,"This is the first time I have commented on anything that I have viewed on television, but I feel that this 4 part adaptation of North & South has produced marvelous performances from all of the cast. The two leads in particular. The official site on the BBC has proved that I'm not alone in this, and just check their drama message boards for literally hundreds of comments about the production. They will entertain you for hours. Must add that the man of the moment just has to be Richard Armitage. His portrayal of John Thompson is terrific. If I had a comment to make, it must be about the disappointment of not being able to buy the DVD yet! Hopefully it will be available SOON.",2004
10,"This is one of the best, if not the best period mini-series to come out of Britain in recent years. Being an avid Pride and Prejudice (and Colin Firth fan), this is better. Seeing the previews, I initially thought it was stuffy and just another period piece.....boy, was I wrong. I decided to give it another chance, rented the DVD and watched it in peace. It is amazing...acting, scenery, story, etc. It is simply mesmerizing. I read the book after watching the series and personally liked the series better. It was tighter and had more of Mr. Thornton than the book...and OH! can Richard Armitage convey more emotions in one look than in a hundred pages. Go rent it...better yet buy it. You will not be disappointed.",2006
9,"This movie is not what you might expect. It is not your typical sports movie, where a disparate team comes together to triumph over adversity as the music swells with a dumb sense of pride.

8,This movie was phenomenal in every way. It had incredible performances under a great director with a fantastic story to back it up.,2004
10,"To be honest, I went to this movie primarily to see Christian Kane, but the reviews had been excellent. I expected a cross between All the Right Moves and Remember the Titans, but it was nothing like the second, which was about two coaches forced to make their teams blend into one while avoiding racial problems. There were elements of All the Right Moves, though, as several of the young men expressed their desire to get out of Odessa through football, but the movie focused on several of them rather than just one. Its best companion piece in my opinion is the Texas Cheerleader Murder, which shows the same football madness from the other gender as they will do anything to be cheerleaders! ",2004
5,"There are some nice touches here, things like the idiots calling in on the radio shows and ""for sale"" signs on the family's lawn after a loss. But overall I was disappointed. I haven't read the book so I don't know how to compare it with the film, but on its on the movie left me flat. Billy Bob underplays his part nicely, but I NEVER got a sense that this was a veteran high school football coach at one of the more high pressure, high profile programs in Texas. I love that actor who played the QB, but again never saw him as a player of the caliber he was supposed to be. Mostly, he just screwed up. The way Permian suddenly started playing well in the playoffs didn't make any sense. The assistant coaches were non-entities (as they almost always are in football movies.) Would a high school coach not check with a star player's doctor himself if there was an injury question? The flashy black tailback (Booby) and the quiet but powerful black lineman (Preacher) are almost stock characters, though both are well acted. Actually the most interesting character was the Hispanic defensive back, but the movie didn't do anything with him. The climactic game was highly dubious. It's hard to imagine a team being that physically dominant and then suddenly getting pounded for the last two quarters, Again, I didn't read the book, but the movie overplayed Carter's viciousness. Don't refs in Texas throw flags for that stuff? There were more things in this film I liked and more I disliked, but overall it was a disappointment. The great high school football movie remains to be made. I guess I'll have to write it myself.",2006

6,"I have to say first of all that I had high expectations for this movie. I heard it was supposed to be a very realistic film about high school football. Having heard that, I had in mind a high school equivalent of a movie like Any Given Sunday, which I felt was amazing in representing on-field play and (I imagine) very good about off-the-field goings on. I must say that FNL didn't represent High School football the way I remember it. I played for a fairly small school (about 500 students) in a small but supportive town of 6000. I remember we had about 2000 spectators for one game. The kind of football represented in Friday Night Lights is the kind that may be authentic for the large and rabid Texas town in which it is set, but a brand which seems to me closer to college football than the high school football that I and probably most others remember playing.",2005

3,"I honestly expected more from this movie. That may have been the problem. There was not one time when the camera was still - ever. On close ups, the camera shakes, the subjects move, and I get a headache. The cuts are so often and so fast, that the viewer often finds himself/herself wondering what just happened. (LOOK OUT, SPOILER ALERT) And at the end of the movie, when you expect to have a happy ending after being put through so much useless thought to comprehend what is going on, they end up losing. To me, this was a basically terrible movie, wrecked by a camera man with ADHD, and lack of a meaningful meaningful plot.",2005
3,"Having been born and raised in Odessa, and having graduated from the ""other"" high school in the late 70's, Odessa High School, I had mixed emotions about this movie. I no longer live in Odessa, but will always be a Texan at heart. I didn't like the way that this town of 80,000 plus was portrayed as a dirt poor small town. If I'm wrong about this, please feel free to correct me, but I believe OHS also plays in the town stadium, and the ""Home of the Permian Panthers"" sign that was shown at the stadium used to be at the practice field at Permian. I would have liked to have seen a little acknowledgment about the cross town rivalry of the big game in town every year, OHS vs Permian. I am curious why the outcome of the game was altered though, I think it would have been just as dramatic if the real outcome was portrayed. Overall, the movie was okay, made me a little homesick, remembering the ""good old days"" of MOJO.",2006

5,"I rented this movie primarily on the strengths of Billy Bob Thornton. I think he takes on consistently good roles. This movie had a lot to offer in terms of plot.

When the Permian High Panthers loses its main star Boobie Miles, all hope is lost. It is up to newly appointed coach Gary Gaines to flare that hope again. The movie was shot in documentary-style. Similar to a reality show. It gives a realistic feel to the movie which helped the movie a lot. It distinguished itself from the other sport movies. It brings us closer to the team.",2017
10,"Based on the award winning book by H.G. Bissinger, Friday Night Lights provides the audience with an inside look at the magnitude of high school football in Texas. The film follows several players, as well as the head coach, as the Permian Panthers attempt to win the State Championship during the 1988 season. The roles of Mike Winchell and Don Billingsley are portrayed well by Lucas Black and Garrett Hedlund. Through their performances, Black and Hedlund were able to show the pressure and stress that football players felt. At one point in the film, one football player says, ""relax we're seventeen"" and Billingsley responds, ""do you feel seventeen?"". This quote emphasizes how in Texas, high school football players are held to higher standards than most teenagers. The best performance came from Billy Bob Thornton though, as he played Head Coach Gary Gaines. Thornton does a great job in showing the anxiety of a football coach in Texas. It was cool to see Billy Bob Thornton and Lucas Black together again, eight years after they starred in Sling Blade. The film is directed well throughout, but the final scene stood out the most to me. The scene consists of three football players standing in the parking lot of the stadium a couple days after their last high school game ever. As the players bid farewell to their careers, you can see how a huge part of their lives is over. High school football really isn't like it is in Texas anywhere else. Through excellent directing and acting, the film is successful in highlighting the enormous impact that high school football has on small towns in Texas.",2017
1,"A film about morons - that's all there is to say. Every single character is stupid and self absorbed. There was not one person in that city who knew or cared about anything else except American football. That's stupidity at its best: ""I'm stupid and proud of it."" I have not found a single character to care about in this film. I felt a little sorry for the kids but those kids would grow up to be just like the adults in that town: stupid and proud of it. I would also like to say that some of the 'headlines' I saw or heard in this film are amazingly moronic and some actually dangerous: ""Whatever it takes"" ""There's too much learning in school"" - bad grammar too. ""I've got straight A's... because football is everything"" And the constant 'melody' of the film: ""This is the only year of your life that matters"". Really?!!! Why don't they just kill themselves after high school then?! I admit that I don't like American football at all. But I always enjoyed sports films and it never mattered what sport. There have been plenty of movies about American football that I enjoyed... for entertainment value, not for the sport. This is the first film about sports that I ever considered just taking the DVD out of the player and throw it away after 30 minutes. If you are an American who likes to have beer hanging out of his cap then you will definitely enjoy this movie. If you speak moronic you will also enjoy this film. If not stay away from it!!! 1/10",2010
1,"I love sports films. They sometimes have that clichéd quality to them that makes them watchable, which is why there are very few ever made anymore. Sadly, the only way to make a good sports film is to find something that actually happened or possibly shoot the film in a way that is unfamiliar in its context. FNL failed on both accounts. Not only was this film a blatant rip-off of Michael Mann's visual acuity, this film also failed to mention the 'Based on a True Story' tag was utterly false. There were many little details that were in the film that actually happened in the book, but the racism, the separation of the classes, and the economic strife that was in the book didn't come to life on the screen. Instead, the over used story lines that were portrayed in the film became something of a bore, and the nice cinematography couldn't save this film. I found it rather dull and a sad betrayal of the truth. And what is even sadder, Buzz Bissinger has sold his soul just to make a buck off the book by calling the movie accurate. So who cares if Odessa can't acknowledge it's racist past? Can we ever not acknowledge the Germans were Nazis? The tinkering of the truth was the real issue for me in why I despised this film, because let's face it, the truth would have been a lot more interesting.

We see that all started when the Belgians gave power to the tustsis, because they had a fair skin and a complexion much more similar of the Europeans then the hutus.

This is a Must see movie. It will take you back to when Rwanda was in trouble and no one came to help except one guy who sheltered 1000 Tutsis and is a hero of Rwanda. It was sad though because it was a war and a lot of people died. Very educational and a good lesson to learn about peace and war. The movie was so great but very sad I cried and I am writing an essay on the movie. I also want to see it again. It was so good and there is a lesson to be learned about helping and keeping peace between people. I felt very sorry for the people of Rwanda who lost family members.,2005

9,"After an art house release everywhere else in the civilized world, LAYER CAKE (LC) unexpectedly premiered in our area, the Lehigh Valley, at the $4 theater in Easton (this joint started as a second-run theater, but it's been getting some acclaimed imports and indies lately, too. Somebody there is a good programmer!). This British import, adapted by J.J. Connolly from his novel, is a taut crime drama that moves with the sleek menace of a tiger. Imagine THE BIG SLEEP with an ever-so-slightly more coherent plot and, as its protagonist, a prosperous, wily drug dealer looking to retire after one last score instead of tough but noble private eye Philip Marlowe. Our hero's problem is that he's a careful, calculating businessman in a dicey business where he's surrounded by loose cannons who shoot, stab, or punch first and ask questions later. Director Matthew Vaughn has been best known as Guy Ritchie's producer, but in his directorial debut Vaughn is like Martin Scorsese to Ritchie's Barry Sonnenfeld (that's meant as a compliment to all concerned, I assure you). It helps that Vaughn gets excellent performances from Daniel Craig as our cool but in-over-his-head unnamed antihero (usually films and books that refuse to name their main character strike me as trying too hard to be clever, but it works here), Michael Gambon nearly stealing the show as a cultured but ruthless narcotics kingpin, Colm Meaney and THE INTERPRETER's George Harris as our protagonist's partners in crime, and many folks from Guy Ritchie's films. Sienna Miller doesn't get to do much beyond being eye candy, but she's tasty eye candy indeed. I'm as heterosexual a gal as they come, but after seeing lithe, leggy Miller strip down to black lingerie and garters, I couldn't help thinking, ""That Jude Law is one lucky guy!"" :-) One of the things I liked about LC is that the protagonist, while thoughtful and competent, is never quite as clever as he thinks he is; somehow everybody manages to be one step ahead of him, if only because they're all so damned unpredictable. Though I've only seen Daniel Craig in three of his many films (the other two were THE ROAD TO PERDITION and THE JACKET), he's clearly one of those actors who never looks or sounds the same from role to role, so if he does indeed end up being Pierce Brosnan's successor as James Bond as rumored, it'll be interesting to see how he fares playing the same character in more than one film! :-) In any case, Craig certainly lives up to the ""new Steve McQueen"" rep that LC has garnered him. I look forward to seeing what he'll do next!",2005

8,"Gangster movies used to be an American staple; during the heyday of Edward G. Robinson and James Cagney, they rivaled the Western as a particularly American film genre. These days, the British have been making some terrific gangster movies; ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" (on which ""Layer Cake"" director worked as an assistant), ""Gangster #1"" and ""I'll Sleep When I'm Dead"" are gritty and impressive in their own ways. In ""Layer Cake"" Daniel Craig plays a smart drug dealer who has made enough money to retire on and intends to do just that. His supplier, Jimmy Price (Kenneth Cranham) has a pair of last jobs for him; to find the missing daughter of his close friend Terry (Michael Gambon), and to broker a potentially very profitable ecstasy deal with the volatile gangster Duke (Jamie Foreman). Against the misgivings of his right-hand man and back watcher Morty (George Harris) and his own better judgment, he accepts and is shepherded through the process by Jimmy's man Gene (Colm Meaney). Right away things spin out of control and get worse quickly. As with many of the best British gangster films, alliances are made and broken at a dizzying rate, nobody is who they seem to be and nobody can be trusted. Director Matthew Vaughn is impressive, even though there are a couple of moves that are kinda, well, ill-advised, he keeps the pacing fast enough to keep you off-balance much of the time. No wonder Fox offered him ""X-Men 3,"" you can see he has an affinity for action. The cast is competent, and I've gotta say, I've always admired Colm Meaney, from his ""Star Trek"" days on down. He plays a very dangerous man in this one, and you absolutely believe he is capable of doing very bad things. The twists and turns get dizzying towards the end, and the final one comes literally from out of nowhere. ""Layer Cake"" illustrates the strata of British gang-world, from the wealthy bosses to the crack heads in the crack houses, and is believable throughout. Clearly one of the best of an already outstanding crop.",2005

9,"Johnny Depp takes us by the hand and in the gentlest most reassuring way leads into the heart, soul and mind of an artist. How easy is for the world to judge. How frightened we still are of all we don't understand. The very nature of innocence is suspect because innocence belongs exclusively to the innocent. Every time the world claims to protect it, tends to destroy it. ""Finding Nerverland"" is filled with moments of enlightenment. Moving and powerful moments but none more so than Julie Christie's face as she applauds, converted to the fantasy transported into her daughter's house. The moment and the enlightenment are short lived, but, somehow, remains in my mind as a glimmer of hope. If for a moment she accepts the mystery of it all, maybe we all could. Johnny Depp is the best American actor of his generation, period. Kate Winslet is a stunning rarity among her contemporaries. She doesn't look like anybody else and the camera catches every tiny little thought that crosses her marvelous face. Congratulations Mr. Forster you can count on me from this moment on as a devoted fan.",2005

""Finding Neverland"" gave it to me, in spades. Johnny Depp, hey Johnny you're the best we've got. I forgot that it was you two minutes into the movie, I only knew I loved that character. That in itself is part of the many miracles the movie has in store. Yours, is a performance of perfect beauty. Kate Winslet is quickly becoming my favourite actress. Julie Christie is, was and always will be my ""Darling"" but Freddie Highmore, you and your brothers gave me one the best evenings in a movie theatre I had in a long, long, time. My girlfriend just read my comment over my shoulder, her comment was very succinct: ""You write like a woman"" Okay, let's see if that's a good thing or a bad thing. Good night kids.",2005

This year it's Finding Neverland, which has produced a lot of buzz in favor of Johnny Depp's sophisticated performance. Although the film deserves all the praise it gets, it is understandable that moviegoers are a little weary with another dramatic period piece, with another ""oscar caliber"" cast, about yet another take on Peter Pan.",2004
9,"Finding Neverland is one of the best films I have seen all year. Depp and Winslet are superb and their supporting cast is very strong in particular Julie Christie, Dustin Hoffman and Freddie Highmore. Forster's direction is tight and he maintains a story which had the potential to drag. Depp delivers a performance that is truly believable and he interacts with his co-stars well, in particular, Freddie Highmore who delivers a performance that outshines Depp's. It is a tour de force of acting talent. Clearly Highmore has a great career ahead of him. 9/10 for a superb piece of film-making, made diligently but, unfortunately, up against such strong contention, it had to make do with a disappointing award haul.",2004

10,"I am not one to warm up to movies centered around themes such as this film. This is not because the idea of adults finding their inner child is ridiculous or immature to me. Its a result of films facing that theme also face a very big challenge on managing to correctly portray a transformation of an adult by children. Also if it actually extremely benefits the adult character in many profound ways. Most of the times films never succeed at this and are done so irresponsibly promoting dangerous styles of living that could be just as hurtful to others around us. Now the major question that is posed then, is why does this film succeed where others do not? What makes this film so precise yet so open? ",2009

It helped that I now knew Freddie Highmore from his subsequent starring role in ""Charlie And The Chocolate Factory"" and it helped to watch this on my best TV which highlighted the magnificent cinematography in here.",2006
7,"This movie is a fantasy about a fantasy, and as such it poses questions as to how we should view it. As a work of art, it evokes wonderfully the 'belle epoque' that centred on the first decade of the 20th century, when life was still permitted to be beautiful before it was torn apart by the shells and mustard gas of the decade that lay in store. And it does so with characters who enter stage left, exit stage right, and deliver the occasional sensitively lit monologue along the way. The most revealing moment is a shot of barely a couple of seconds duration, when after bidding goodnight to his wife who has entered her own separate bedroom, Barrie opens the door to his and reveals the briefest glimpse of a fantasy landscape within.",2005
10,"Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet, two amazing performers. Now, throw in Dustin Hoffman, Julie Chrisite, and four adorable children and you're in for a treat: Finding Neverland; a story about a play write, Sir James M. Barrie, who meets a woman named Sylvia Llewelyn Davies, with four children, who doesn't have a husband. The family inspires him to write a story about children that don't want to grow up, evidently following the path of the story ""Peter Pan"". I really didn't expect to like the film as much as I did. I heard about it and was anxious to see it, probably for the fact that Johnny Depp was in it. I thought, ""Hm... story about a writer... whatever"", when I first heard about it. It didn't seem to be much of a big deal, but it is. I read about it on the computer to see if I'd want to go see it. It seemed interesting, but I wasn't dying to see it. I decided I'd wait until it was out on video. I was nudged by many of my friends to rent it and watch it, since they had thought it was stunning.",2005
10,"This was an excellent movie with all the cast working like a superbly orchestrated cast with magnificent performances especially by Johnny Depp. Depp never ceases to amaze me with his hidden power that captivates me.

10,"I saw all of the candidates for the Oscar, and still feel that Johnny Depp and ""Finding Neverland"" should have won in the Best Actor and Best Film categories. Depp is probably the most talented and versatile actor in the world today, and the movie was terrific -- a wonderful addition to his brilliant portfolio. He is truly in a class by himself.",2006
10,"Fellow Movie Afficionados, I walked into the movie theatre: 1) to see two of the best actors of my generation (Depp & Winslet), 2) not having any background on JM Barrie, 3) not really even knowing the story of Peter Pan, and 4) not really ""believing in Neverland."" This protocol (seeking out films with good acting regardless of the storyline) has served me well in the past; I'm sure I am not alone in saying that there are occasions in which I am driven by a film to read the book or more upon which it is based. Although I later found that certain artistic and factual ""liberties"" were taken to tell this version of the story of ""Neverland"", I am not disappointed. This is a telling that brings to the foreground the universal truths and feelings that become more warm and hued -- if sometimes difficult to accept -- as one grows older. Johnny Depp is exceptional in turning in an appropriately subtle, moving performance as a man who can't be who his wife, theatrical agent, and other adults want or expect him to be. At least not until he meets a young widow (Winslet, in a poignant turn) and her sons, who adore and accept him just the way he is. I will not further elaborate on the plot; instead, I offer that, for those of you who are,like me, sentimental ""fools"" who spend most of their work-week as ""human-doings"" in an effort to project a hard-bitten corporate visage that may serve us well on the promotion ladder but does little to improve us as human-beings. . .this is definitely a DVD to buy for the Sunday afternoons in which you can take a private break from the rat-race, and believe once more that ""whatever lies ahead is nothing compared to what lies within.""",2005
10,"Imagine a wonderful film with no violence, no obscenities, and no torrid love scene...FINDING NEVERLAND proves that, yes, it still can be done successfully in this day and age and stand strongly against other films.",2005
10,"I have never been a fan of Johnny Depp, but he plays JM Barrie beautifully in this charming adaptation about the writing of Peter Pan. This film shows how the book and play were created and the inspiration behind the characters. The children are played wonderfully especially the little boy who plays Peter and is to be staring along side Depp in the new adaptation of Charlie and The Chocolate factory as Charlie. Kate Winslet also is very natural and movingly plays the mother of the children and the inspiration of Wendy. All in all this film is naturally and magically filmed, leading to a magnificently moving ending .",2005
10,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I was amazed with Kate Winslet's performance. Before this movie, I had just seen Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and I was amazed that it was even the same actress! She truly becomes each of her characters. I think she and Johnny Depp are two of the most impressive actors of our day. The child that plays Peter is a phenomenal actor, with a lot of potential. The storyline is very well developed and you get engrossed into the relationships of the characters. Everyone in this film I thought did a spectacular job. It's truly one of my favorite films of 2004. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone interested in a talented film.",2005
10,"In a word this movie was stunning. Bravo to all involved. This is truly one of Johnny Depp's finest performances but alas I think that as he has not already won an Oscar he will not win one again (I'm sure he does not care though, even if many of us think it is / will be a crime.) Kate Winslet follows Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind with this and shows her versatility again, an actress at the very top of her game. Also the young boy Peter was amazing. I don't have much more to say, just see this movie and don't be put off by the slightly slow start, believe me it doesn't take long before you are hooked. Go out and rent or buy the DVD when it becomes available unless it is still at theaters then go see it with a crowd. I guarantee few of you will find it less than almost magical. This movie reminds us of what it is like to feel your soul.",2005
10,"Ended up going to see this movie on a whim. I had no expectations, and found it to be inspirational. It seems like most living in this commercial driven society are used to structure; they are used to living the way society ""expects"" them to live. This movie, more so than revealing the story of how ""Peter Pan"" came to be, reveals a message for the need to never lose your imagination - it is what allows us to create our opportunities rather than choose among those created for us. Not sure that I'm onto anything either, but at the age of 24 I feel that this story also attempts to make the point that the only truth is love - that you can't know it - you can only feel it. Hence, you can't be afraid to feel; yeah sometimes the truth hurts, but fear is even more hurtful.......",2005

10,"Amending my statement as to the greatness of this show, which, I should point out, has been online since '05. Let me reiterate most vehemently: this was by far one of the best shows ever on TV. I think that Heroes is such a corporate fraud of this program. I liked Heroes for a while, but never forget that I knew from the beginning that it was a corporate takeover of the much better 4400. Now I can barely stand it. The plot is all twisted and crazy. The 4400 at least deserves a mini-series followup in which some of those tangled threads are sown up. This is by far one of the best shows ever. Take a look and see. The hero vs. villain plot was really fleshed out in season 4, only to end to abruptly. I know that the writers strike had a part in the shows demise, but still: NBC owns USA and thereby at least could grace us with a replay on SciFi, another NBC holding. They replayed KINGS or whatever its called, and it is no where near this caliber. I say again: mini-series of 4400 to resolve some stuff or else!",2005
10,"The 4400 is easily one of the best sci-fi shows on television. Every episode builds up suspense almost as cleverly as 24. You form a bond with all of the characters as the series progresses and it leaves you on the edge of your seat, wanting so much more. I honestly must say I can't wait for next season. Any of these absent-minded posters who give this show a bad rating should be ignored.",2006
8,"The 4400 is in a word - amazing! The acting is excellent and I'm glad it's an ensemble piece. The vulnerability of Shawn as he struggles with his abilities & social life is well captured by Patrick Flueger. Maia (Conchita Campbell) is innocently cryptic. The romance between Richard & Lily is sweet and deals sensitively with racial issues. Tom & Diana learn to care about the returnees as people, not subjects, and certainly prove themselves in the fantastic finale. The remainder of the cast including Kyle (Chad Faust) in a mysterious coma and Jordan (Bill Campbell) as the sinister, self appointed leader of the 4400 are also well cast. The storyline kept me gripped throughout. The music was well chosen, especially ""Bye Bye, Baby"" in the pilot. I love the title sequence too. The effects are superb. The second season proved to be just as exciting and emotional, as the first. It also introduces Jeffery Combs, my favourite Star Trek actor. It's his best role yet. Each key character gets a storyline of their own, which intercut nicely with the overall arc. For every question answered, there's a new one raised, so you're never bored. This is essentially a show about people, rather than solid sci fi, which is a definite plus. Well worth buying the DVDs. I'm sure Season 3 will be equally fantastic. I can't wait. A+++",2005

It's not just me that thinks that is it? The 1st season was great (mini-series included) and even the second was pretty good. But now it just seems to be lost! I don't know what the hell the deal is with it, but it seems like the writers are snoozing or maybe they are off on other more important projects, I don't know. It is a real shame because there is nothing else to watch during the summer. I really wish they would get with program and make it enjoyable to watch again. If this keeps up, I doubt we will see a fifth season.",2007

4,"I really wanted to like the 4400, and for the first few episodes, I did. The premise of abductees returning was intriguing, and in the first few episodes, watching the various ""powers"" of the returnee's was fun. Sadly, the poor acting of the major characters, especially Joel Gretsch, made what could have been a fun romp into SciFi, a long slow arduous horror show of constant over acting. Then, things turned from bad to worse. The plot lines devised to include the main characters, started to stretch the fabric of credibility. When the main ""investigator's"" nephew starts to show amazing powers, and eventually becomes the head of the 4400's secretive organization, the governmental agency doesn't balk at one of the most absurd conflicts of interest, which in the real world, would obviously negate his future involvement. He is partnered with female named Diana Skouris, (X file fans, sound like another female partner's name? Dana Scully anyone?) who also has a background in science (yet another Scully coincidence?) and ""adopts"" one of the 4400, a child who knows the future before it happens, she doesn't get removed from the case either. (Nor, in future episodes, when the investigators and government need to know things, like the location or targets of 4400 terrorist, do they employ let alone discuss the use of the child to help them know terrorist targets) Things get even more bizarre when Joel Gretsch's character marries a 4400. Again, no conflict of interest there. (another oddity, the woman he marries on the show, is the real life wife of Billy Campbell, who is supposedly assassinated on the show, by, surprise, Joel Gretsch's son on the show.) Like I said, the ""Fi"" just continues to get more bizarre. Its to bad, as many of the 4400 guest stars bring some interesting and refreshing acting and character developments. This show started off with some mystery and great potential, now, it has devolved into a bad soap opera, rife with convoluted relationships, in a poor attempt to include issues which were much better covered in Alien Nation, or X-Men, the natural instinct of people to fear the unknown or those who are different. It might not be too late to save the 4400, if only the writers would change back to the unfulfilled promise of the first few episodes. And a change in the leading man certainly would refresh what has become stale in less then 1 seasons and two episodes of the second.",2006
1,"I can't believe I wasted hours watching this. It started out interested, and morphed into one of the worst shows ever in history. It's almost like a parody, with terrible acting and ridiculous story lines. As the seasons marched on, it got worse and worse. Season 3 was virtually unwatchable from an intellectual or entertainment standpoint.",2017

6,"I've watched every episode of this. After months of uncertainty, The 4400 was cancelled. Possibly a victim of the writers' strike, probably not the only one... but it would be unfair to put all the blame on said union act. Yes, this show definitely had its ups. Yes, there were occasional great episodes, such as the season two finale(which shall remain nameless in this review, to avoid spoilers), and even the rare extraordinary one, such as Life Interrupted. Yes, some of the show was fantastic. Some of the writing was intelligent, realistic. Several points made, themes explored, were very interesting. There was genuinely good and worthwhile science fiction found here. How often do you find that on television? Among the action and the special effects there were parts that were truly impressive. The drama wasn't without accomplished moments. No, this show wasn't all bad. But all the wasted potential is just difficult to overlook. The problem is, the very concept is flawed... it's partially overreaching(twelve episodes per season), and it's also just not limited enough. The obvious gaping plot hole, the logic problem, was never addressed(I cannot reveal what it is here, because it would be a spoiler)... in fact, the show always seemed unwilling to limit itself, for purposes of concise story-telling(and never run out of material... and for an inestimable amount of such, not to mention only having 42 episodes in total, for four seasons, they had far too many episodes that... just weren't all that good). Said storytelling did have something to offer, but not very much. There were too many things that they seemed to never really explain. Plots and ideas were introduced, seldom developed enough, and they either were not concluded, or it was done in an abrupt and unsatisfactory manner. Characters were presented, explored(if even that), and dismissed(another error in that department is arguably taking the Mulder & Scully approach). Acting was hit-and-miss. The symbolism was blatant, sometimes even insulting. It always seemed like it was going somewhere, bigger, smarter, better, and it just never got there. If it had some message, it lost it along the way. The season finales got increasingly more desperate, trying harder and harder to be given a renewal, and to promise viewers more, but continually failed to deliver. They almost never seemed to handle actors being unavailable terribly well, either. In the end, this was a mini-series that got unexpectedly high ratings, so the network decided to capitalize on that(and the lack of (new) Summer programming) by bringing it back as a series... and the producers may not have had enough of a plan. The people behind it maybe just weren't up to the task. The behind the scenes people were of insufficient talent, I suppose. I recommend this to fans of sci-fi and the actors(a certain one, perhaps known more from his horror work, who's done sci-fi before, appears... excellent as always, a bright spot in the show)... just don't expect consistent quality over the run of the series, or for everything to be wrapped up(partially due to the show's cancellation). 6/10",2007
10,"Having seen reviews of this series, I finally got to see it when my DVD arrived. The story is really compelling and thought provoking. It asks of the viewer the ""what if"" when 4400 people are returned to the present day after being snatched being some unknown beings. The events surrounding their return start of innocently, but then more and more of the returnees, or 4400s, are exhibiting unexplained psychic skills in varying degrees and levels. My favourite 4400 is undoubtedly Maia, and the actress playing her has a bright acting career ahead. The title music is so cool. I've almost totally memorised it. I am already looking forward to Series 2, and with so many snatched individuals there's spaces for 10 series. Well worth missing out on a night for!!! I give this series 11 out of 10 for effort, story and acting.",2005

After a very solid, yet writers strike shortened first season, The 4400 looked like it was going to be Heroes meets the X-Files, easily the next big thing in science fiction television. If that wasn't enough to interest fans, the show also had a head start, as its creators weren't newcomers. The 4400 was the brainchild of Rene Echevarria (Star Trek: The Next Generation) and Scott Peters (V, The Outer Limits). The show looked like a can't miss, then came Season 2...",2016

7,"Walking Tall is a decent remake with some flaws from director Ken Bray whose admirable in making this movie but a short running time, some over the top action, and the lack of a more central villain is what weighed it down. Walking Tall however isn't that bad and it's one of the better remakes out there. Dwayne Johnson is solid as the lead and proves to be a talented actor while bringing some of his wresting experience to the movie during the action/fight sequences. Johnson turns in a good performance of a man who returns home to find it overrun by crime and corruption, which drives him to become sheriff in order to put an end to it. The rest of the cast including Johnny Knoxville, Neal McDonough, and Ashley Scott are okay in their roles but (except for maybe Knoxville) they're not given much to do. The movie felt short and rushed with an 86 minute running time. Some of the fight sequences especially the one near the end between Johnson and McDonough go over the top. Johnson's performance however and the action sequences make this movie worth seeing at least once. Overall despite its flaws Walking Tall is decent remake one of the better ones with intense action, fist fights, some humor, and good performances by the cast.",2009

8,"What makes Walking Tall such a good movie, in my opinion, is that you really want The Rock to beat the bad guys. Obviously, in these type of movies the good guys always have to win, so it's really important that the director make sure the good guys come out looking much better than the bad guys so that when the good guys win, the audience is satisfied. This movie does that perfectly having The Rock have something extremely cowardly done to him near the beginning of the film. Johnny Knoxville adds a lot to this movie as well with some good humor.

The Rock from his wrestling days is a good physical actor, like Stallone, and Arnold.  This is a must, not many people can do physical acting, and that is half of what makes a good action movie.  That action film with the guy from Cruel Intentions shows how awful and action movie is with out good physical acting.  That movie had 1) too little believability. 2) emotions of pain, physical stress do not look real 3) the action looks phony and out of place. If people think Stallone did not take some real punches for Rocky they would be mistaken, for Rocky would loose it realism with out physical realism.  That part said,  I find the story line good, but inferior to the original.  I like true storys better than fiction.  Bad events like this story shows really do happens;  I would bet this movie is going be on TBS 'Guy who like movies' week.

1,"I would like to speak to the people that voted this film a ten, surely they understand nothing about A) Acting B) Dialogue C) Plot D) What makes a good film!!! This was one of the worst films I have ever seen, without a doubt, absolutely shocking! The whole idea of The Rock blatantly smashing up a casino and getting away with it because because they cut him up was ridiculous, he still did the crime for f$$K sake!! The crowning moment had to be when they threw him the piece of wood (The evidence!!!) and he went off to become sheriff (sacking all the staff) and then preceded to walk around with a piece of wood and Jonny Knoxville as his partner!! What the F**k was the director thinking??! ",2005

1,"I recall seeing the hit Bing Crosby-produced original in 1973 and thought it was okay... and a fitting tribute to the memory of Sheriff Pusser and his family. So I reordered it on NetFlix and they sent me the remake by mistake. My complaints? First off, this bears no resemblance to the Pusser story (Washington state?). It's more of 'Road House' meets 'Rambo.' There's nothing here that anyone hasn't seen done better a dozen times before. The phoned-in script could've been written on a damp cocktail napkin and 'The Rock' could be used to describe his acting range. Nothing about this version approaches the level of creative inspiration. It's a total waste of time. Thankfully, it's also one of the shortest movies I've ever seen. Bleeaaach and yawn... back in the mail you go.",2005
6,"The Rock is one of the greatest performer in and outside of the ring, but 'Walking Tall' isn't one of his best. Dwayne Johnson is missing the stuff that made him famous. His character of Chris Vaughn lacks his sense of humor, his charisma, and his ability to hook the audience's attention. Hooking the audience is the key and sadly this movie does not. The Rock's persona got cut back, as Chris felt more like a bland Boy Scout. Chris Vaughn is supposedly based on famous sheriff, Bufurd Pusser of the 1960's. This film ever cut the best parts of the original Walking Tall story by having the events place out in Washington, rather than the Deep South. Nothing against Washington, but the Deep South is where the real Buford Pusser's story begins. Pusser is known for his virtual one-man war on moon-shining, prostitution, gambling, and other vices on the Mississippi-Tennessee state-line. As sheriff, Pusser survived seven stabbings and eight shootings. At less, the 1973 version kept him in the same area and same name. That movie had Joe Don Baker as Buford Pusser, and it did kinda strays pretty far from the basic facts of the crusading sheriff's life. It's not a great film, but there is some entertainment value associated with it despite the endless amounts of boom mikes in some of its shots. The film made Pusser, a ex pro-wrestler who comes over to stop a casino and prostitution ring with a 2x4 Wooden Board, that was later use as a gimmick for another wrestler Hacksaw Jim Duggan. Walking Tall was rated R, having more violence than the 2004 version. For goodness sakes, Pusser almost got his jaw almost blown off, and his T-shirt so soaked with blood. The 2004 movie plays it safe with it being PG-13. Having it PG-13 somewhat hurts the film, due to the reasons that I can't find the villains to be much of a threat, the Rock can't be the bad-ass he is, and the movie felt like safe career move for Dwayne Johnson. Vaughn, the homespun do-gooder underdog type, will only further cement Dwayne likable movie persona. That's why it seem like Chris Vaughn is carrying a 2x4 of boredom while cleaning his town. After return home from service, U.S Army Special Forces Chris Vaughn looks for work at the mill to find it closed and a casino has taken it's place as the main source of income of the town. He soon find out that his old school mate Jay Hamilton (Neal McDonough) is the owner. Neal McDonough is just what you'd expect from a generic bad guy - he does a lot of sneering and nothing more. Not only does Jay own the place, but his ex-girlfriend Deni (Ashley Scott) works as a stripper there. Ashley Scott is just what you'd expect from a generic girlfriend - she has a nice body, an acceptable face, and almost no dialogue. After noticing the casino is fixed and selling drugs. He wrecked the place. So if you want to become Sheriff, go berserk and wreck a casino. Then become your own lawyer at your trial, and plead why you should be Sheriff to a town that hasn't saw you in years. Tell them that the casino is evil despite probably most of them income comes from working at the casino. Yes-surely that would trust you. Chris Vaughn runs for sheriff, wins somehow and fired all the polices due to original Sheriff abusing his power. Rock doesn't like that, so Rock abusing his power to fight against the casino. Meh. Chris call upon his friend Ray (Johnny Knoxville) to try to stop the casino's drug running. Clearly Johnny is just there to be a comedy relief and it's just awfully clear. He plays himself most of the time. Sorry, but I don't buy Chris Vaughn, a crusader against drugs hanging out with a foreign alcoholic man like Ray. Their goal to ruin the casino, and save the town by doing so. Wouldn't the town go under if the casino went away, and how on earth will they rebuild the mill with no money? Does he have a million dollars somewhat to start it back up? Face it, this movie is lackluster at best, and is lead by a man who is only famous for beating up other men in questionable context. The action fighting scene looks faker than the pro-wrestling, he came from. For somebody that came from the Special Forces, his character really doesn't know how to do hand to hand combat. Lot of dull moments full of combination of very loosely based fact and Hollywood revisionism. Walking Tall had the potential of being something very good, but end up playing it safe.",2013
4,"Like most people; I enjoy the over-the-top, mindless drivel action movie every now and then. Who doesn't have those moments when they walk to their DVD collection, grab a couple Van Damme movies or their worn out copy of Die Hard and know that for the next hour and a half; they won't have to think. Instead, they'll be able to kick back on the couch, maybe have a couple beers and let their testosterone levels overflow with explosions, fight scenes and the random chick who's only point in the movie is to get half naked and throw out her three lines about how manly the main character is.",2004

The film is a powerful story about one army man and his fight for what he believes in and he has to find justice outside of the law . Director Kevin Bray captures every bone-crunching hit,kick,punch ,he wants to make sure that the action was raw,intense action sequences.Today's cinematic world of explosions,gunplay,people floating through the air and everything else you could imagine however this film is a just straight-up,old-fashioned,old school,hard nose,blue-collar and great feeling of realism .Club-wielding sheriff with a four by four piece of ceder gives hits and punch.The protagonist admirable rendered by the Rock has a big stick and he's trying to knock somebody's jaw loose.Violents incidents have a different flavor and character to go on and do more to succeed at his goal.The first incident in casino has a train-wreck chaos and hell breaks loose in old-fashioned stomp .In the next incident when he returns for revenge,it's more stealthy kind of shooting style because it's a more stealthy incident,he's got a bit of a plan even though he's acting out of rage,he's using the techniques and skills that he learned in the military.The third is basically just make it as riveting and energetic as possible,just a real thing,director is bringing back the movies of old,of yesterday that really took visceral raw action and put it on screen .This is an ultraviolent crime film wowed the movie-going public. The picture is dedicated to the memory of Tenesse folk hero sheriff Buford Passer but is based on real deeds.In fact,the movie is a remake of ¨Walking Tall¨1973 by Phil Karlson (with Joe Don Baker) and spawned numerous sequels(with Bo Svenson)and TV series.This film is even more violent than original .

2,"From the outset, I want to say that I have never been a fan of movie remakes. Hollywood remakes, similar to sequels, are just vain attempts by movie producers to replicate the success of previous movie blockbusters.

As a 41-year-old woman attending with an 82-year-old friend, I expected a light, pretty, romantic fairy tale, and that's exactly what I got.  Never saw the first movie, but the ""catch-up"" work at the beginning made that a non-issue.",2004
7,"I remember seeing the first movie not expecting much from it, but when I walked out I was pleasantly surprised! When I saw the previews to this movie I thought ""Oh god! Another movie ruined by a sequel!"" I was slightly wrong in my thinking, because this was in fact a cute, light-hearted, feel-good movie. Maybe it's not as good as the first, but I still thought it was rather enjoyable. Anne Hathaway is a great actress and I'm so glad her talent was discovered and recognized. Julie Andrews gave a great performance as the former Queen of Genovia. This movie may have been predictable and a big ball of fluff, but what do you expect to a sequel to a Disney movie where Pixar wasn't involved? I would recommend this movie to anyone, just as long as you go into it knowing it's different from the first. I'm just praying there won't be a third movie.",2005
6,"What does it mean to be a princess? Besides wearing tiaras and twin sets, dancing at ballsattracting fame and fortune simply for being beautiful? A princess is stuck forever in extended adolescence  she only has the trappings of power. Symbolically, at least, a queen has real power, and does not necessarily need to be beautiful. ",2004
1,"Maybe this movie is enjoyable for the target audience (10-15 year olds), but for everyone else I think it's a waste of time. It was much too long and had a lot of ambiguous scenes added for the little girls watching it. Examples include a scene where Mia walks into a room in her castle closely resembling a mall, that is filled with clothes and jewelry. Another scene is a pajama party (Mia is 21) in which stuck up little girls sing karaoke and slide down stairs. The script is one of the worst I have ever seen. The lines that are supposed to be funny are so dumb it's almost funny. All in all, don't watch this movie unless you are a huge fan of one of the stars or are stuck on deserted island with only this movie. My favorite part of this movie were a few of the songs, including Breakaway by Kelly Clarkson.",2006
1,"You'd think that after 5 years since we last met her, Mia would have developed something close to maturity! I went to see this at the theatre because i quite liked the first movie, however, as is often the case with sequels, it offers nothing new and entertains not. Really, really bad. I actually felt embarrassed for the people involved in this movie...I mean the whole slumber party thing, (just one example)takes this movie beyond fairy tale into a realm of absolute idiocy.All efforts of humour are overdone and you just don't sympathise with any of the characters as you did with the first. In short: this is a disappointing and boring sequel from Disney.",2006

Now, this movie was supposed to be aimed to teenagers and pre-teens, preferably girls. I remember seeing the original and I was just curious to see how they would do the sequel (since most movie's with sequels are really bad). ",2004
4,"I just recently viewed The Princess Diaries and over all liked it pretty much, so I figured I would see the sequel. I rented it yesterday and watched it this morning and it seemed to me like it was the same plot as before only with a couple different elements. The film also felt very rushed in some aspects, some of the plots or characters that took place seemed to come and go. Although I'm still not sure since I haven't read the books, but the movie itself was just predictable and a bit too silly at times, it just seemed like it could insult the audience it was aimed at.",2007
1,"I will just say that the one good thing about this movie is that it's really nice to see Julie Andrews singing again. There is no debating the fact that she has an amazing voice. What does bother me is this increasing trend of teensploitation movies that are appearing regularly in the cinemas. Film makers appear to have found a genre that appeals to the teenage girl who still puts the pillow case on her head and dreams of the perfect wedding and boy are they sticking to it. Take one virginally attractive young woman, give her no brains but an abundance of good intentions, place her in a variety of bumbling situations and add one completely plastic love interest. Acting school? Only add as a very last resort if character's can't manage basic facial expression. Completely ignore the only two interesting characters and their complex love story to focus on the teen dream of the ""perfect man,"" and the fight to win him from the dark side. Even makes the first Princess Diaries look like Citizen Kane. Very very Boring.",2005

The ""mattress surfing scene is wonderful especially when the Queen (Andrews) pops in and everyone thinks OMG the party's over. But NO! Anne Hathaway is absolutely gorgeous, so guys will of course enjoy the ""eye candy"" and the ladies have some pretty hunky guys around too. The real story of this movie though is the fleshing out of the relationship between Joe (Hector Elizondo) and the Queen. That's the most interesting subplot in the story and the most enjoyable too. The ending is somewhat of a predictable surprise. I found it to be enjoyable. Not as witty as the original but still worth the watch.",2005

I can watch it again and again and again, and not get tired of it! It's magic seems to last forever! Anne Hathaway plays a wonderful portrayal of Princess Mia, and her performance is never unsatisfactory. I think, to quote the previous commenter,...the 'transition', was quite effective! The movie was intended to describe Mia's life after she graduates from college. It was not meant to continue where the books left off, and if that was the case, Meg Cabot, wouldn't have let the movie go into production!!! And yes, there may have been 'eye-candy', but what's a comedy-romance without it? Many congratulations on the movie's success, it was well-deserved!",2006
1,"I absolutely hate this movie for 2 reasons...one, it was terribly corny and the ""jokes"" were anything but funny. Two, it wasn't like the books at ALL!!!!!!!! Has anyone else read the books? In the books, Mia is a freshman in high school when she finds out she's a princess, the grandmother is very, very mean and awful to Mia, Michael is Mia's continued love interest, and is a senior when she is a freshman, not the same age as her, Mia's dad does not die, he is found to have testicular cancer, meaning he can't have anymore children, meaning that Mia HAS to take the thrown, and Mia writes in her diary a whole lot, unlike in the movies, where there's only one or two scenes even mentioning her diary. The first Princess Diaries movie wasn't THAT bad, it actually managed to stay mostly true to the books, and it can be expected that they would change some things around, to make it a better movie. I understand that. But this movie...I can't even begin to wonder what possessed Meg Cabot to allow such a travesty to be made out of her stories. It was unbelievably horrible and a disgrace to the books. Nothing that happened in it happened in the books. Absolutely nothing. Michael didn't even make one single appearance the entire movie! It's truly amazing how they managed to twist it around so much. I give it a 1 out of 10. Awful.",2005
4,"The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement is an unneeded sequel and for adults the movie isn't very good. Mia {Anne Hathaway}, the new princess of Genovia, is ready to assume her role when she learns she may have to become queen even sooner than expected. The catch: she must get married first. With the help of her grandmother {Julie Andrews}, they begin to weed through possible candidates. I think the plot was a little weak and of course the film is predictable. The first one had a lot more charm but this sequel is rather boring. Sometimes the film is charming and that's due to its likable cast. Anne Hathaway does a great job but she can't save the film. Julie Andrews does a good job as well but her singing return was a little disappointing. Heather Matarazzo, Raven ,Larry Miller and Caroline Goodall all have small roles and they do a decent job but I think they could have left out Ravens character. Garry Marshall returns to direct and while he does a better job with this film then Raising Helen, he still could have tried harder with this one. The movie is very unrealistic as well but its a kids movie and it has a fairy tale story so it doesn't try to be realistic. There are a lot of cheesy scenes like the slumber party and most of these scenes are just not funny or enjoyable. I actually enjoyed the first one but this one was just long and not very interesting. The film is 113 minutes long but they don't have a lot of interesting material to fill the running time. The kids I saw it with didn't like it that much either also most of the funny lines are used in the trailer so it doesn't extend much past that. Rating 4/10, skip this sequel and go watch Ella Enchanted it's a lot more enjoyable.",2005
7,"The thing that disappointed me about this movie was the title. I have read most of the Princess Diaries books and I really like them. So the fact that the movie is called the same thing is annoying since it has absolutely nothing to do with the books. If you have read the books and want to see the movie just go in knowing that there is no relation between the two whatsoever. They are two completely different things. Once you know and accept this, you can enjoy the movie. It is pretty nice, with good acting. There is also a scene where we listen to Julie Andrews singing again!

Why couldn't they do Mia's Chirstmas at Genovia like in book 4.5? Also in the books Mia and Michael are still dating! They cut Michael out completely! I wish that there is never another sequel to this. it will most likely be horrible as well. I really hope you did not put much money into this film. I, and a few of my friends, feel this is against the rules for a good movie. I hoped that this wouldn't be as bad as the first movie and I was right. This was worse. Much much worse.",2005

Anne Hathaway is one of my favorite young actresses, and oh my god the guy who plays Nicholas (chris pine) is so hot! The chemistry between Mia and Nicholas is amazing, and the story is sweet and cute. I love Hector Elizondo and I wish he had a larger role in the second film, but he's still fabulous in it. I'm also so glad that Mia stood up for women and refused to get married just because the law told her too. I'm sure Nicholas would have married her if she asked him, heck, Andrew was at the altar, but she wasn't prepared to give up her life to make the men who made the law happy. I can't say enough about this movie! Two enthusiastic thumbs up!",2006
3,"The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement (2004): Dir: Garry Marshall / Cast: Anne Hathaway, Julie Andrews, Hector Elizondo, Chris Pine, Heather Matarazzo: Every bit as predictable as its successor but this one is about marriage and authority surrounding Princess Mia being crowned Queen of Genovia but council ruling claims that she must be married. This leaves a corrupt official an opening for his nephew who is an heir. So now Mia has 30 days to find a husband. Predictable with not a shred of creativity other than the fact that Mia's maids should not be allowed out in public. Directed by Garry Marshall who made the first film as well as the adult version titled Pretty Woman. Anne Hathaway is ready for something bigger and better. This role requires her to get to know a guy in record time before deciding to spend the rest of her life with him. What a crock of sh*t. Julie Andrews sings, which is about the only positive aspect to her otherwise familiar character. Hector Elizondo is the security adviser with sound advice that unfortunately doesn't involve leaving this film. Chris Pine plays the umpteenth boring male heir lined up to score quickly and pretend this is happily ever after bullshit. Heather Matarazzo also reprises her role as that annoying best friend from home that nobody liked in the first film. Typical sequel that is about as engaging as a kick in the ass. Score: 3 / 10",2015

Chad Micheal Murray is a great Austin for this movie and has what it takes.I never get sick of watching this movie.Every character in this movie was the right pick.I'm so glad Hilary played Sam instead of somebody else.If you are not interested in this movie, at least give it a chance!

This Cinderella Story has a modern twist like no other. Hilary Duff and Chad Michael Murray were great actors in this love story. This Love is about a girl that loses her father but then meets the worst woman if her life and her two stepsisters. But then she takes control of her life. Samantha(Duff) showed girl power and her true colors in the end of the movie towards Austin (Murray) and Fiona (Jennifer Cooliedge). This movie inspires many people to go for their future and dreams and to find their true love of their life.,2005

That timeless, and useful quote, ""never let the fear of striking out, keep you from playing the game""...after I saw that movie, and heard that line, i changed my lifestyle of leaving everything, calm , boring, and not the way i wanted it. I was afraid that I wouldn't be accepted if i didn't do a certain thing, or if I did a certain thing. I was wrong, and this movie, strange as it may sound, gave me the nerve to do some things I never would have done on my own.

10,"As an ""old"" fan of the Parent Trap, both editions but liked the modern version the best, I found this movie captivating and a must have for my limited movie collection. I love the modern story and the use of the ""you have mail"" symbolism. I am still emotionally high on the experience and I am watching parts of it daily for spurts of energy, romance and fantasy into my otherwise interesting but routine life. My granddaughters are laughing at me because I even bought the sound track and played it in the car when I picked them up at school. ""You don't even like that kind of music"", is all I hear from them through their laughter. I am determined to ""like"" the music at least half as much as I love the movie. Wish there would have been more buildup, ie, details of the instant message relationship and more focus on the Prince and Cinderella, their feeling and emotions before and after the ball. If your parents, grandparents or other ""old"" people you know, were fans of the Parent Trap, or Ever After, please find a way to get them to watch this movie. Tell them an old retired Army Colonel recommended it.",2005
10,"Well, I thought that this movie is just some teen romance flick that will not emphasize so much on feeling. Fortunately, it turns out unexpectedly. The feeling in this movie is so appealing and sensible. It is not just merely the fantasy story of Cinderella that one would have expect it to be. At least I can feel the emotions and the romance. For a romance movie, I don't expect it to be as great as Titanic, but this movie is just fine. Besides, this movie also brings forth many messages that would be useful to youth nowadays and I consider it to be very educational. The most important message in this movie I personally think is 'nothing is impossible if you just believe' and 'the fear of being rejected' as these messages are vital in the life as a teenager nowadays. Overall, this movie fulfill most of the important aspects that one movie should have. It has a good plot and well-acted by the casts. The casts managed to express their character well and this is quite remarkable as most of them are young actors like Hilary Duff and Chad Michael Murray. This movie also has an appropriate soundtrack to go with it. One more thing, this movie is surely hilarious and I think most of the people will like it. With all the mentioned features, one will remain seated until the entire movie ends. Quite a good movie!!!",2005
7,"I haven't looked at other reviews of A Cinderella Story yet, but especially because it's a Hilary Duff film, I'd expect there to be a lot of scathing comments. That's because Hilary Duff is, or was, at least, popular with tweens and teens, and lots of slightly older folks have a tendency to hate commercial or popular stuff just because it's commercial or popular. Of course, they find other ways to justify their effectively institutional hatred of this stuff, and I'd guess that the main complaint would be the clichéd and predictable nature of the material here.",2006
10,"It is a wonderful film. And if you are like me and think that Chad Michael is fit (which he is) then you will like it. It is funny and a good film to watch. I have watched it over 20 times and i normally won't watch i film more that twice. So i would say if you like funny, romantic, girlie film then you will enjoy it. I don't think many boys would enjoy it though. It is easy to understand and is well written. I think that it is a bit to like Cinderella though. But otherwise i think that every girl should see it.:) I hope if you get it that you enjoy like i have. So have fun watching it.

10,"A Cinderella Story is a great feel good movie that is not just for girls aged 8-16. This movie is almost stereotypical as a nothing teen flick, but by all means its the best Cinderella adaptation I have seen in quite some time. Using more modern things, such as a cellphone instead of a shoe and a convertable instead of a chariot, it makes it much easier to relate too. Cast does very well holding up the movie. Hilary Duff is like-able to kids and adults alike, as Chad Michael Murray will have kids and adults crushing on him. Big Time. Regina King does a great job as the Fairy Godmother type and Dan Byrd is a great comedic energy on the screen. Jennifer Coolidge, Andrea Avery and Madeline Zima do amazing as the villains and add some great comedy to the script! All in All, this movie was very good and all the characters had great chemistry.

10,"From reading other peoples comments on this film, in all honesty i must say i am very disappointed. In my opinion A Cinderella Story is a fabulous film. The setting is really good, and be transferring it to a modern setting, it made the original story even better. Hilary Duff as Sam 'Cinderella' was brilliant but the only problem was that Hilary is very pretty so how could none of the guys at school except that freaky drama guy never have noticed her before? Also would like to add her dress was absolutely amazing. Chad Michael Murray was the perfect Prince Charming, absolutely gorgeous. It made all the girls watching jealous of Hilary when she got her kiss. Chad and Hilary were the perfect couple, as the boys would fantasise about Hilary and the girls about Chad. Overall I must say this film was brilliant and a cool teenage comedy. Any one who disagrees has me to answer to as they are clearly stupid!",2005
3,"""A Cinderella Story"" is yet another instance of Hollywood taking a classic fairy tale from the Middle Ages and doing it up in modern dress. This one is set in the ""Valley Girl"" world of snooty bitches and pimply-faced teens, where love blooms in internet chat rooms, and romantic encounters are reduced to an endless exchange of poorly spelled and ungrammatical text messages.",2005
2,"This is your ordinary Hilary Duff movie. Overwhelmed with innocent, cutesy-cutesy, girlie-ness. The plot is simple. Sam (Hilary Duff) is miserable. Her father died in an earthquake when she was little (wow! real creative!) Her stepmothers and stepsisters make her work. She falls in love with a football jock, Austin Ames (Chad Michael Murray) by instant messaging, and he doesn't know it's her. They meet at the school dance, and she has to leave by the stroke of midnight so her stepmother won't find out that she wasn't working at the diner...then she drops her cell phone on her way (which is a replacement for a glass slipper...cute), and Austin tries to find her, and blah blah blah, you know the story.",2005
1,"Did we really need one more ""cinderella type"" story this decade? Between ""Chasing Liberty"", "" The PRince and Me"", and ""The Princess Diaries"" I believe that we may have that genre sufficiently covered. Like the rash of teenybopper horror movies from the late 1990's , this movie continues to beat the dead horse of an increasingly younger and more immature teen scene flick epidemic. Aside from all that, this has to be the least oscarworthy screen jaunt that I have even encountered. Hilary Duff has managed to play Lizzie Mc Guire in every movie she has been in. Her over the top valley girlesque persona is, at best, flat and lifeless. Chad Michael Murray, as cute as the boy is, has stooped to new lows. It is obvious that he is far too old for the movie, plus this is a complete departure of anything that Murray is qualified to play. The football player is a stretch for someone who is so in tune with his bad boy image. Overall, I would not recommend this movie for anyone over the age of ten. Ignorance comes with youth, and in this case ignorance to decent movie making is,without a doubt, bliss.",2004
10,"This movie is fantastic. It is the classic Cinderella that we all know and love with a modern twist. You do not have to like Hilary Duff to see this movie, but her amazing acting skills help. She adds so much life to the screen that you would not have had if the lead role was played by someone like Lindsay Lohan. (nothing against Lindsay) Jennifer Cooliage is also very funny is this movie. And Chad Michael Murray just scored another gig. Hilary and Chad had great chemistry on screen. But Hilary Duff shined the most. She is untouchable in this movie as she always is. This movie has a great message. (not that it needed one) And it's a great family film. Not that I would want to watch it with my family. I prefer to watch a lot of movies by myself so I cannot be influenced. If you have not yet seen A Cinderella Story, go out and buy it right now!",2005

10,"When Anchorman came into theaters, I avoided it like a dead sewer rat. When it came onto HBO, I pretended it didn't exist. In fact, I would not have even LOOKED at it had my remote control not stuck on the stupid channel. So I watched a few minutes. I didn't laugh. I wasn't surprised.",2006
9,"In a year packed with comedies that were all a bit stupid and silly (and all seemed to feature Ben Stiller), Anchorman: The Legend Of Ron Burgundy reigns supreme above them all. This is a movie that is well aware of its own stupidity, and best of all, it is able to embrace it skillfully so that it is exactly as silly and immature as it wants to be. It is such a great comedy; I'd consider it the Naked Gun of our generation.",2005
3,"My expectations were low. I've liked Will Ferrell's brand of soft-edged mania well enough in the past, but not enough to go see a movie just because he's in it. I went because I remember San Diego in the 1970's, and even the network news in that sleepy city in that era.",2004
8,"This summer I've seen several intentionally stupid funny movies, and enjoyed them. Adam McKay's ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" is no exception. Seems that my taste for high concept cinema has been influenced by the summer-- well not really. This movie written by McKay and it's star Will Ferrell is an outrageous and completely over the top comedy. Applaud Will Ferrell as the mind bendingly stupid and self absorbed, San Diego newscaster, Ron Burgundy. Will Ferrell is genius in playing Ron straight without character dispersions. Ferrell creates a great deadpan sense with his cohabiting dog, Baxter, and the fact that his character Ron Burgundy will read ANYTHING on the teleprompter, his tragic flaw, well at least one of several, is priceless. Ferrell also never crosses the line of being a complete jerk which is an amazing accomplishment. In fact, Ferrell gives Ron a muted charm-- he really does grow on you. ",2004
3,"I was never as excited about this movie as my boyfriend was, mostly because I chalk Will Ferrell's humor up to the level of fratboy hijinx, sex jokes, and toilet humor. But I was willing to chill on the couch and watch the hour and a half comedy. I liked him okay on SNL, and I was mildly amused my Old School. I thought it would be a nice way to relax on a Monday night.",2005
1,"This is just childish rambling with swearing. There's nothing funny about this movie, I find it actually quite sad. Just a bunch of idiots apparently mentally challenged trying to get in women's pants using techniques that would hardly work in a woman if you paid her. But in the movie, it actually does work!!! And it has a 7.2 rating in IMDb!!!! That's just incredible!",2016
7,"I caught this movie on TV during the holidays and it was with a bit of trepidation that I started watching it, as I know that Farrell doesn't get any favor from his critics, which consider his work as mindless, vacuous, entertainment--as for me, this is his first movie I see. But having watched a few minutes of it, I was quite surprised.",2011
7,"""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" takes us back to those halcyon days of the 1970's, when the hair was as big as the lapels and women were just beginning to assume their rightful place in America's television newsrooms.",2005
8,"The most devoted cineastes and the average hoi polloi moviegoers both need to kick back and laugh, without probing or analysis, at a goofball, outrageously funny comedy with zero depth. And that's exactly what director Adam McKay (also co-writer with star Will Ferrell) provides in ""Anchorman."" A very warm summer day, like today, was perfect for the quick gags and physical comedy of this nutty flick. Maybe it's even more of a relief for us folks who are still arguing with each other about ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" and ""Control Room,"" documentaries that make us confront a difficult present and a tenuous future.",2004
2,"Don't really know how to describe this but what a waste of time. Ferrell has surprised me with good parts in Austin Powers movies and the hilarious Zoolander. This would have been a great part for the late, great Phil Hartman, who I would have love to have seen in this role. Just imagining what he would have been able to do with it makes it all the more sadder that he is no more.",2006
2,Personally I just can't believe why such big names in film comedy decided this would be a good film for their careers. The only thing I can think of is that they all realised how many comedy stars were going to be in it and thought 'why not?'.,2006
7,"I went to ""Anchorman"" expecting another super-mainstream, lowest-common-denominator, SNL-derived romp. Now, these aren't the worst movies in the world, to be sure. ""Happy Gilmore"" and ""Old School"" are pretty agreeable ways to while away the time. But usually about an hour in to these affairs, I've had enough of the broadness and predictability, which starts to get downright oppressive. It's not just that they're lowbrow--it's that they're so overwhelmingly, disappointingly conventional.",2004
8,"I came unto this movie only for the scene in the trailer that showed Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) and Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) leaping into each other's arms, right on top of a conference table, as Ferrell yelled, ""Let's make a baby!"" Which is essentially saying I decided to give it a chance out of vague curiosity, not expecting an even remotely good collection of skits straight out of Saturday Night Live. And, I'll say this: I was proved wrong.",2005
10,"My favorite movie ever. Its Will Ferrel up to his usual shenanigans. I laughed the entire way through this movie, so much that I had to see it a second time to catch all of the jokes. The reason I like it so much, is that its such an easy movie to quote.",2007
10,"As I sit and watch Anchorman for what must be the 1000th time, I can't help but ask myself; WHY? Well, the answer is simple. This movie freaking rocks! It boasts an unbelievable amount of one-liners that I am spouting constantly. It could quite possibly become the most often quoted movie ever. Will Ferrell's over-the-top performance, along with other cast members equally daring acts, makes you wonder how much of the movie was scripted, and how much was ad-lib. All of the characters support each other so well, that it is nearly impossible not to have a favorite line from each one. ",2005
7,"Humor is so subjective, and what is mildly amusing is a laugh riot to another; so it is with this scattered mess, a slap-shot collection of often hilarious sight gags. I laughed often and frequently at the silliness, was aware that we're not dealing with literary wit, but material seemingly dreamed up while the guys sat around a table and played ""Can you top this?""

7,"Will Ferrell, Christina Applegate, Steve Carell, David Koechner, Paul Rudd and Fred Willard star in this 2004 comedy. This film takes place in the 70's in San Diego, California where we meet news anchor, Ron Burgundy (Ferrell) and his co-anchors, Brick Hanland (Carell), Chimp Kind (Koechner) and Brian Fantana (Rudd). Soon, newswoman, Veronica Corningstone (Applegate) gets a job with them and Ron and her fall for each other. Soon, they go head to head competing for an anchor position which causes Ron to lose his job. He eventually get his job back and makes peace with Veronica. Willard plays Ron's boss, Ed Harkin. This is one of Will's best, he and the cast are great and I recommend this.",2012
7,"As a rule I don't like Will Ferrell, it fact I don't find him funny at all, so I was really surprised by how funny I actually liked this film. Maybe the context of this film, the 70s setting allowing the sexist jokes to be satirical rather than tasteless, made it for me. Maybe Ferrell is just funnier in this. In fact I kind of forgot it was actually Ferrell as I found his performance truly brilliant- and hilarious. Having said that I think Steve Carell, who I normally hate even more, stole the show. His character and the way he played it was really funny. Maybe it just fitted in with the ludicrousness of the film's setting. The whole set-up was an interesting one, which led to some interesting dialogue about sexism, not too serious, but enough to be noticed. Finally, after Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Tim Robbins, Jack Black, and others popped up for cameos I was gone. I really enjoyed it.",2010

I am sure this wasn't far from the truth in how women were treated. I am glad thing have changed. A lot more out there for women. I think the best part of the movie was the Anchorman Rumble with all the news anchors from other stations. The scene at the zoo was okay. It got to be a bit silly. Frankly the whole movie was a bit silly. I didn't like Jack Black's biker dude kicking the dog over the bridge. I didn't think is was all that funny. All in all not a bad movie. Donna A.",2006

The man in question is a glaciologist who's airborne research over Antarctica spurs a chronological series of memories broken up by nine LIVE concert segments. To sum up the simplistic plot line of the flashbacks, the two young lovers meet at a rock concert and then each major sex scene at their Islington flat is punctuated with brief concert segments (shot guerrilla-style with the couple in attendance).",2005
5,I came to this Michael Winterbottom film from one of his previous efforts starring Samantha Morton and Tim Robbins. I had never heard of him as a director and when Sight and Sound (the house magazine of the BFI) did an article on him I thought he was worthy of attention.,2005

9,"It seems strange to have such an affection for a film that is so flawed and fails in so many areas. Either way, I really really enjoyed Nine Songs, a relationship drama told strictly through sex. First, we'll list the failures. The acting of our female lead is a bit suspect and makes her, in the end, unlikable. The photography, although intimate and immediate, suffers from it's DV quality and makes you wonder how beautiful this film could have been shot with the eye of perhaps... Lars Von Trier's dogma lense. Most importantly, the movie relies on two ingredients that in the end prove a bit useless. We are reliving the story in memory via the male lead as he travels through Antarctica. Although it is an interesting metaphor and a captivating landscape, it seems almost entirely unnecessary. We hear him say ""you can be clostraphobic and agoraphobic all at the same time, much like the bedroom."" Secondly, and most important, the live music is inconsequential, although good. The actual image quality is low, the songs play for too long, the lyrics apply to the narrative not at all, and the bands all flirt with one style (Michael Nyman being the exception). I must say, there is an outstanding version of ""Jacqueline"" by Franz Ferdinand.",2005
8,"This is a love-it-or-hate-it film, as reflected by the deep divisions in critical response. It is a serious piece of film-making but there are two major components that you may love or hate - extreme sexual explicitness and modern rock music.",2005
1,"This film stinks of pretension, as do all of the positive reviews I have read about it.",2006
1,"A sorry nonsensical excuse for a porn flick. Why in the world director Michael Winterbottom has confused himself into believing that by putting footage of live gigs in between explicit sex scenes warrants the film (I say film in loose terms, more like 'footage') as 'mainstream' or 'art-house' and not 'porn' is beyond me. This truly was a waste of a cinema ticket.",2006
1,"This was a wasted 65 minutes. Mercifully short, fortunately. No plot, totally unappealing characters, and absolutely no idea why they got together, why they stayed together (the sex didn't seem all that great) nor why they split up. Maybe Micheal Winterbottom is turning into a dirty old man??? I'm sure he can do better than this. I will give him the credit of the doubt, after all he made code49 and Jude the obscure, but simply filming naked bodies (badly) and intersecting them with poorly recorded live music is no excuse for an ""art film"". If it is true that he wanted to make a serious adult movie about the sexual aspects of a relationship he should watch his classics again, and certainly Ai no corrida.",2004
1,"This is one of the most boring films I have ever seen. There is no discernible story line. Despite all the very explicit sex there is no build up to it, resulting in a complete lack of any sexual tension - and the dreary repetitiveness of the sex act robs it of any eroticism. There is a limit to how long two people banging away in a room, with nothing else remotely resembling a plot going on, can hold the viewers interest. It doesn't help that the chief protagonists are not very attractive (my very subjective opinion, admittedly) and the whole pointless charade is punctuated periodically by loud bursts of awful music (although some might consider these intervals the best bits of the film).",2007
10,"Any movie which tries to show sex the way it is deserves a 10 in my book. I live in a part of the US (Utah) where many sexually repressed (& therefore abused & damaged & deranged) people live - where many people live who hate their own bodies & the sexual parts of their natures. I grew up in the culture here which fears & loathes sex & true honest naked human bodies. When I was growing up I hated & resented the sexual feelings I started to have. Now as a mature adult who's rejected the abusive repressive culture of his youth, I am very pleased and honored that Salt Lake City is as of today (12 August 05) one of the places which is showing this film in the US. I commend the film makers for trying to portray sex the way it is - in a way far better than the fakey nonsense of Hollywood, and in a better way than the fakey nonsense of the crass forms of ""porn."" I know that porn was a term created by people who didn't like the wall paintings at Pompeii, and I think that non-fakey non-coercive ""porn"" is highly useful, but fakey porn which has moans and other accouterments which are fake isn't useful. I think we need more portrayals of true human sexuality. It's not all that flashy. It's not fake & restful either. It's just plain old wonderful sex. In ""9 Songs"" one type of sex is shown - the type where the female prefers that the male leave his condom on long term. But the couple is young, and 20 something young adults rightly play the field, and that's good. Anyway, one local repressed-culture-advocating newspaper in Salt Lake referred to this film as a type of ""porn."" I would say that it's not, any more than getting up in the morning and taking a shower, or seeing yourself naked in the mirror, or even your masturbating or having sex is ""porn."" A far better term is life! Sex is part of life. To the repressed repressing people I say: Get used to it! Learn to love it!",2005
8,"Michael Winterbottom has redeemed sex for grown-ups in the movies. He has discarded the theatrics and acrobatics of porn and, at the other end of the scale, the overbearing artistic aspirations of, for example, the sex scene in ""Don't Look Now"" (which, on a good day, I do not necessarily think was too beautiful for its own good). Winterbottom's approach looks more like what real people do when cameras are not present. There's a lot to be said for that in a world where most directors would be inclined to overdirect. And the interplay between the song sequences and the sequences when the couple is alone is right. Just as the live music performances trade the polish of studio recordings for the vitality and rough edges of life, so do the sex scenes offer the power of reality--and its imperfections--in the place of meticulous attention to lighting and makeup. Winterbottom has edited rather than choreographed and, despite his success in carrying it off, I doubt that many directors would be willing to take the risk of using that technique.",2005
9,"Do you occasionally expose yourself to contemporary art? Such an experience touches me at a deeper level if I put aside questions like ""What's the artists intention?"" or ""What was the cultural or political motivation for his/her work?"" Approaching contemporary art from a more intuitive point of view, paying less attention to the analytical side of my brain and more to how a piece of art makes me feel is usually a rewarding strategy.",2005
6,"Well indeed, this movie is only about sex. It's only about flesh, smells, sexual intercourses, sometimes kinky, it's all about life in the end. Is it a porn movie? I would not go that far. It cannot be a porn movie as it is not intended to be one. Nonetheless, it shows enough to be one. The music is very good throughout the whole film, which is actually a succession of sexual scenes and gigs (some the best Brit pop around now), but not good enough, though, to make the film a masterpiece. In a word, it's a good movie about what a relationship can be (in its sexual dimension and beyond)- or even should be ? It's all about life, and that's what cinema is all about.",2005
10,"I didn't know a thing about 9 songs when I rented it. It was so brilliantly acted, I thought the only way this could have been done was if the two leads were lovers and they directed the film. But no, this is real ....sex that is....the actors portray first love in the most truthful light I've ever seen. The fact that there was no script adds to the realism of the film. Both actors give their hearts and souls to this film. Director Michael Winterbottom's idea is genius. In an industry where everything is becoming increasingly ""false"" Winterbottom brings the epitome of realism back to the camera. Anyone who has a problem with this film is probably just upset that they never felt the way these two people felt. My only question is, is this considered pornography? I haven't looked up the definition lately, and frankly I don't care if it were but the film definitely pushed the envelope in a society that is increasingly right wing.",2006

Amazingly, even though you're only seeing the sex, you're seeing the reality of a relationship and able to see the emotions and feelings of both people from beginning to end. It's an interesting note to all those movies out there who try to show everything BUT the sex...maybe you're missing the real point.",2005

7,"Just watched it again yesterday - it's striking how good the action is compared to the ridiculous dialogue. I completely understand why this movie got such terrible reviews; after all, it marked the first ""let's make a quick buck"" entry in the two beloved Alien and Predator franchises and was done by a director who many felt didn't treat the material with the respect it deserved. When I watched it yesterday I got angry at times because some of the dialogue - well, most of it, actually - is truly awful. It's hard to take characters or a story seriously when nearly every sentence spoken resembles lines from a parody of cheap science-fiction and horror movies from the fifties and sixties. But despite all those flaws I have to admit I enjoyed the movie from start to finish - because of the amazing set- and creature-design and the more than decent action sequences and special effects. Whoever designed those really scored and seems to have a great love for the art of Giger and the previous films. So if you can get past the silly characters and you're able to ignore the more obvious shortcomings (like the idiotic decision to make the film PG-13) you're in for a fun ride. My vote: 6.5 out of 10.",2013

This movie is superb in nearly all aspects I watched it more times then all the prequels combined.

Once Paul Verhoeven left America to resume his stellar work in Europe, I guess the MPAA had to have someone to pound upon.

A huge fan of both series, I wanted more than anything to like this film and for it to at least be average. After all, I cannot think of many film ideas that have had more potential. This very well could have been the best action and sci-fi film ever created, only if it had a decent director. I actually gave Anderson a chance, a 10% chance of making an average film, and a 0% chance of making it into what it deserved and had the potential to be. Those who gave him more should be embarrassed. I'm embarrassed that I paid to see it, however, I have a unique way of justifying it.

I liked how this film revealed a little of the back story of the predators (since they have always been a big mystery) and it tells about how the aliens are the predators ultimate prey. Sure the plot had a few holes like how did the alien queen stay alive when frozen for that long? Or why the aliens acid blood dissolves the claws but not the spears or the bladed disc. But that is made up for with the fight scenes which i personally thought were exiting and very well done. And i thought it was interesting how the aliens used their own queens acid blood the burn through the chains and free her. My opinion on this movie is this Allot of people say it sucked but i think it was alright (partially because I'm a big fan of both series ans I saw AVP:R first) but if you don't have an open mind about this movie don't watch it, if you are a fan of the alien and predator franchises I would highly suggest this movie.",2010
4,"Alien Vs. Predator has some cool scenes and some other entertaining moments but mostly the film is a disappointment. The fast-breeding creatures from the Aliens films take on the headhunting space colonizers from Predator in a battle for the earth, leaving a poor team of Antarctic archaeologist's and the rest of us lowly humans trapped in the middle. The plot does sound like it has potential and if it was rated R it could have been a lot better. The execution wasn't very good though since its just not very exciting. The death scenes are lame as you can't even see what's going on. Most of the action scenes are boring and that's a problem since that's one of the main reasons why a person may watch this film. The acting is terrible but its normal for this type of film. The most notable person in this film you might recognize is Sanaa Lathan but she of course doesn't add much to the film. The rest of the actors are of course bad and you have a better chance of laughing then being scared. The film is predictable because you know where its going and who's going to survive. The dialog is bad and funny but in a bad way, which is always a bad thing. Yet even with all this negativity I didn't completely hate it. Some of the action scenes were cool and its a pretty movie to look at, especially the creature special effects. Paul Anderson shouldn't be blamed as Fox wanted to edit the movie and make it earn more money. The films running time of 102 minutes feels a lot longer though. Rating 5/10 I had some fun watching this but this film is for hardcore fans only and even they will probably hate it.",2005
6,"Okay, so this isn't Alien or Predator. Did any of you really think it would be? Seriously, now. Let's get some perspective here. There will never be another Alien, or Aliens, or even Predator. What a lot of your die-hard fans fail to recognize is that this movie CAN'T be those films.",2005
1,"Okay the real rank may not reflect on the actual IMDb database but this is without doubt one of the worst and most unpopular movies ever produced. Paul Anderson takes a royal dump on the faces of all fans of both the Alien and Predator franchises. Although one cannot say that everybody's a fan of the franchise, one simply cannot deny that Alien,Aliens and Predator were some of the best movies ever made and also commercially successful. Now how would it be if Pokemon had an episode with Aliens and Predators? Probably better than this movie.",2006
3,"Why is Wesley Snipes sharing screen time with Ryan Reynolds and Jessica Biel? Who cares about Hannibal King? I paid to see Blade kick butt, just like in Blade 1 and 2.

6,"I was never a big fan of the original 'Blade', but I liked the sequel a lot. Doing away with the story building of the first one, Blade II captured a nice balance between plot and action and it was an entertaining ride throughout. For this third instalment, however that perfect balance has been interrupted, and calling this film 'action heavy' would be an understatement. While the action in the movie is well done and entertaining to watch, when you've seen 45th bad guy being smashed through a window, it loses it's impact somewhat. The talking scenes in between the action are either small plot details that the film needs to string itself together, or just another action sequence set-up. The plot is messy to say the least, and there's far too much going on for it to be streamlined into an engaging and satisfying story, but nevertheless it follows the vampires as they resurrect legendary bloodsucker Dracula and get Blade into trouble with the cops. However, Blade manages to team up with a ragtag bunch of vampire hunters and together they attempt to thwart Dracula and the rest of the vampires! Oh, and the cops.",2005
1,"This is a seriously poor film... and I don't know where to start. The product placement of the i-pod? The fact that the production wants you to call Dracula Drake (in a hip move that makes you think of comics and naming conventions over the fact the guy is called Dracula!)? The stupid on-foot chase between Blade and Drake? The fact Whistler is beaten by the Feds, when he survived Vamps? The inappropriate comedy? The stupid blind woman? The fact Drake was just resting, wasn't in a tomb at all, and woke up when he chose to? The crapness of the script? The poor introduction of Whistler's daughter? The lack of tension? The horrendous ending?",2004

1,"Who came up with this awful mess? Goyer? Hope he doesn't have much to do with any other Marvel movies coming out soon, or I won't be seeing them in theaters. Every part of this movie was awful. It's almost as if a child wrote it. The whole ""back to the beginning"" thing has been done so many times and this time was the worst that I have ever seen. This part of the storyline was especially disappointing, since I have always enjoyed the way the vampires existence was explained in the previous blade movies. Although, the acting wasn't stellar, I don't think they could be blamed for much. Seems like the majority of the blame falls on the writer/director. Character development was atrocious. Seemed like far too much time was given to unimportant characters .. Triple H .. and far too little on those characters around which the movie should have been centered.",2005
4,"Blade and Blade II were movies that were mostly visual masterpieces which thrived on the atmosphere; Blade II more than I. Quick transitions, scenes that mostly had only one predominant color. The Blue of the Ninja type fight, the amber of the night scenes, the red of the Moo Cow Factory where Blade and Whistler were finally reunited. Blade was to be a great modern vampire epic, where they were no longer regarded as immortal undead beings that were warded by celestial tokens and pure substances like water but rather as a recessive niche of humans that is either blessed or cursed by genetic defects that cause severe allergies to garlic, silver and sunlight. Blade II was a great second installment because it was dark, it was moody, the atmosphere was pressing, the story was good and the concept artists really did their best at it.",2005
8,"I must say that going into seeing Blade: Trinity I was not expecting a masterpiece, I merely wanted to be entertained by this movie. With that said, it did a pretty decent job. People can criticize this film with having a thin plot, being corny at points, heck I know I will, but I don't think the makers were going for a great plot, and great acting, more along the lines of action/comedy and lots of fighting/explosions.",2004

The first and second movie are awesome sci-fi action flicks.I read so many negative reviews how the fans and critics dissed this film and how are disappointed with this flick. I love it. I am not gonna say is the best movie, it is not but It' is a pretty good movie a worth of a watch an awesome underrated sequel. Blade: Trinity rocks! I am a fan of all Blade movies. Before this movie come out I kept watching Blade I & II. It was been 7.years when I finally download and watch this movie, today I watch it on Blu-ray and Blade third installment rocks. Blade: Trinity is rated R! RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR not PG-13 It Is violent, action gore adrenaline sci-fi flick not for kids. I can't believe how Robocop (2014) remake is praised from fans and critics but Blade get's dissed and bashed from critics it is just not fair!",2015
1,"Oh poor, poor Blade, one of the most underrated and under-appreciated comic book heroes finds some success with his big screen debut, ""Blade"" (1998) only for it to be followed by a sub par ""Blade II"" and then this catastrophic debacle of a film. To even consider this movie to be a ""bomb"" would be giving it more praise than it's worth, since ""bomb"" can be used in a positive meaning (i.e. it's da bomb). This film truly is a total pile of trash, a pile so trashy, not even the most desolate bum would eat from it. The main problem here with this cinematic nightmare, is the storyline is just plain goofy, at times too goofy. After twenty minutes or we find that Blade must again don his cool leather jacket and dark shades and face off against the evil forces once again. Let me take this sentence to say this, I think that Snipes is a total bad ass in all three Blade films, the final battle he has against Deacon Frost in the first Blade movie is one of my favorite fight scenes of all time. This film fails to carry such excitement, and instead, we are left with fight after fight of basically the same redundant fighting moves (stake through the heart, burn up the vampire, etc). Snipes does his best to carry this movie, but its just the writing is so bad. The greatest problem with this film is the ensemble cast, composed primarily of American Pie and Van Wilder rejects. Here's the rundown of their performances: Jessica Biel is hot yet she can't act to save her life. Ryan Reynolds (sheesh) boy what a mistake givin this guy a shot at fame, he basically ruins this movie with his smart-ass, or actually dumb-ass antics. Parker Posey does pretty good as the main villain even though as the movie goes on you see less and less of her (which isn't a bad thing). Finally, Triple H who basically brings his wrestling persona to his role, as well as some of his wrestling moves, does OK as the tough bad guy, although he would be better as say a tough evil Bond henchmen. Anyway, the storyline revolves around the vampires bringing back Dracula (Bram Stoker is turning in his grave I'm sure) and once they do Dracula will try and take over the world. Eventually, Blade and the rest of the gang, track down the evil vampires and a huge climactic battle ensues, which pales in comparison to the final battle from the original Blade movie. So there you have it, if you're the biggest Blade fan of all time, I recommend you still pass on this movie, and instead watch the first Blade movie on DVD or whenever TNT reruns it.",2005

10,"I must admit to being a little apprehensive about seeing the third instalment of Blade as i was very disappointed by the second movie, but boy was i surprised. Although, the Dracula plot has been a excessively used over the years, it didn't take anything away from the brilliance of film as it put a totally new spin on the age old tale of Dracula. What the movie lacked in dialogue was certainly made up for with action and King's (Ryan Reynolds) one liners and humour were well worth the entrance money alone. The addition of Whistler's daughter, who was following in her father footsteps was well worked into the storyline. All in all, i thoroughly enjoyed the latest Blade outing and will definitely be going to see it again",2004

Never before have I seen such distasteful, amateur, pointless nonsense reach the screen (with perhaps the exception of Son of the Mask). How on earth David Goyer can write the original Blade (a fairly good film), and then write this is beyond me. Perhaps the film would have had a saving grace if a Director with some talent had taken the helm, but I fail to find one decent reason why this film was ever released - surely there must have been people to see what a disaster this was before they gave away the money for it to be made.",2005

Jennifer Garner, transported from a 13 year old girl into her 30 year old future self, gives a thoroughly appealing performance which is backed up with strong support from the likes of Mark Ruffallo, Judy Greer and Andy Serkis. Greer in particular is very well cast, she displays subtle but perfect comic timing, some of it improvised (watch out for the Bambi line towards the end of the movie).",2007

1,"I'm beginning to see a pattern in the movies I give a 1 to. They are almost all movies that my wife made me watch. Maybe I should stop having faith in her taste in movies. Anyway, this is typical drivel aimed at pre-teen girls but done even more poorly than usual. Once again, the writer broke the cardinal rule of any movie. He/she made the main character unlikable. She starts off by being a complete b*tch to her friend at the beginning, and then finds out when she becomes 30, that she's basically a sh*tty person (having affairs, etc.). Why the F would we feel for this person? OK, let's say we can get past that. Jennifer Garner is about as far from attractive as you can get without having some sort of deformity. I don't know if it's her or the writer's fault, but her character goes well beyond my threshold for annoyance. Here's a tip for future filmmakers: 13 year olds are NOT entertaining, they're annoying. Far and away the most embarrassing moment in the movie came when they danced to ""Thriller"". Holy crap that was painful. It showed her practicing that dance at the beginning. That explains why she knows it, but an entire club full of people?!? Argh!!! The Macarena would be more believable! All of a sudden she's completely incompetent and has no clue how to do her job and no one notices? At least Tom Hanks' character on ""Big"" had a job that made sense to a child.

No one can escape his tearfully cute charm and sweetness nor Jennifer Garner's equally hilarious performance in this laugh-out-loud comedy, superior to the similar 1988 film ""Big"", featuring Tom Hanks.

It just makes you want to marry Mark Ruffalo (even if you're a guy) and curse the day he married Sunrise Coigney (honestly, he is THAT CUTE in this movie!!!!) Everyone played so well and you can easily tell that everyone had so much fun working in this film, on set and off. It was an absolute delight to see Garner go from enigmatic super spy to bright but clueless 80s sweetheart. You even regretfully start loving the ""antagonist"" Tom-Tom for her totally ""happening"" skanky personality!!! The greatest theme of the film, to be true to yourself, resonates sweetly but powerfully in every scene. It is an utter joy to watch over and over again (Mark Ruffalo is beyond STUNNING and just reduces you to tears at the end, not because of the movie's ending but because of the realisation that you can't be his wife!!!!!

8,"I put off seeing ""13 Going On 30"" when it opened this past spring. Though it starred the stunning Jennifer Garner, the movie looked to be a rip-off of ""Big"" or Disney's ""The Kid""-- 2 movies I really loved. I finally saw director Gary Winick's movie on DVD when on vacation a month ago. I was wrong. ""13 Going On 30"" is a funny, charming, and sentimental romantic comedy noteworthy on its own. The screenplay by Josh Goldsmith and Cathy Yuspa is unexpectedly bitter sweet, and quirky at the same time. This is truly a star vehicle for ""Alias"" star, Jennifer Garner. Here in ""13 Going On 30"" she is radiant, vulnerable, beautiful, and very grounded. Although Garner's next project is the action movie, ""Elektra"", her talents and gifts are so tailored for romantic comedies-- that being good romantic comedies like this. Jennifer Garner is a more glamorous Julia Roberts. Well, this is enough of my point of view. ",2004
7,"Sometimes a formulaic movie rises above its material due to the charm and performance of its star. 13 Going On 30 is one such movie. We've seen this plot before in Big with Tom Hanks and in its numerous followers the last 15 years. We have a female version of Big this time, starring the wonderful Jennifer Garner from ABC's Alias. It's impossible not to like her performance, which is charming, heartfelt, full of wide-eyed innocence, and star-making. It's clear from watching this film that Ms. Garner is headed for major roles in the future. While the film seems geared toward a female teenage demographic, there's plenty of wish fulfillment to go around for guys too. I mean who wouldn't want to be Mark Ruffalo in this film? To have a hot girl like Jennifer Garner calling you Matty and trying to make things up to you is enough for any male to maintain interest. The 13 year old Jenna wishes she was 30 when her birthday party goes awry and she blames it on her best friend Matty(Ruffalo). At 30, she wakes up as Jennifer Garner, and is forced to try to make sense of what's going on. In the spirit of the better recent body switch movies, like Freaky Friday with Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis, 13 Going On 30 isn't just a movie with comical results. There is also sort of a moral to learn, which makes the film all the more endearing. Sure there are several parts to the movie that require an enormous suspension of disbelief, such as how Jenna goes from 13 to 30, how Matty would even want to bother with her at 30, working with her magazine colleagues with a 13 year old brain, and especially what she proposes to revamp the magazine she works for. Do we really believe the public is ready to discard celebrity gossip and layouts in favor of ordinary people? Do 13 year old girls really wish they were 30 at times? I'm not so sure about that. However, the complications that ensue via the charming Garner captivate us, and make us yearn for a second chance for something in our pasts too. We can all identify with that. The dance sequences weren't as fun as they were intended to be; because, most of the songs in the film were released long before Jenna would have turned 13 in the movie, making them seem out of sync with her time line. Garner's bounce and energy were enough to carry this film, which is above average of its type. *** of 4 stars.",2004

But my friend told me about it and said that it was such a cute movie, so I rented it and we watched it together, I was actually trying to hold some laughter in because I didn't want to admit that I might have actually liked this movie, but I have to be honest, I guess I actually enjoyed 13 going on 30! It was really cute and was a sweet movie that worked very well, Jennifer did a good job on playing Jenna, I actually felt so bad for her, her feeling like she had no control over how she acted over the years before she turned 30. Well, I guess I should tell you a little about the movie.",2007

I suppose I was hoping for more of that in this movie, but it was much more superficial.",2005
10,"It's funny how Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, two of Hollywood's most powerful men, who could literally do any movie they want, end up making something like The Terminal. Instead of reaching for new heights of film-making like including the latest in special effects, or new original ways of storytelling and editing, Spielberg goes back to a simpler form. That in itself is surprisingly refreshing. Filmmakers try so hard to be inventive and change the typical form of the classics, that when someone finally does go back to that Capra or Wilder fashion, it ends up seeming original. That's what The Terminal goes for. A movie about characters, not plot. About emotion, not CGI. It's a true heart-felt piece of work. It's funny, it's cute, and it always keeps you interested.",2004

8,"Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) has just arrived from Krakozhia in JFK Airport, when there is a coup in his small eastern country, with the revolutionary forces taking the government by force. The USA does not recognize the new government and the validity of his VISA and passport are canceled. Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci), the bureaucratic administrator of the airport, who rules by the book and does not show any compassion for people, leaves Viktor, who does not speak English, in the international lounge of the airport with a problem without solution. While patiently living in Gate 67 for a long period, Viktor survives, learns English by himself, makes new friends among the employees of the airport and falls in love for Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta-Jones). ""The Terminal"" is a delightful and uncommon fable about a patient man who is trapped by the bureaucracy in the international lounge of JFK. I heard that an equivalent event would have happened indeed in Paris, but there is no reference on the DVD, and the writer takes the credits for the idea of this theme. Anyway, Steven Spielberg is really magic, and was able to make a delightful movie with such a weird storyline. Tom Hanks is excellent as usual and the beauty of Catherine Zeta-Jones is still very impressive. My vote is eight.",2005
7,"The Terminal is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a great cast.I have certainly come to expect better from Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks,both easily some of the most talented men in Hollywood,and if their previous work together (Saving Private Ryan and Catch Me If You Can) is any indication,this movie should have been a classic,and I understand that they were taking a risk and were doing a very unique movie,it just didn't turn out as well as it could have.Tom Hanks and Catherine Zeta-Jones scenes together are certainly the movies highlights,there is great chemistry between them and seeing Tom Hanks deliver one of his most unique performances was fun to watch.I felt the movie could have been better with a funnier script,it had many funny parts,but for a film that is considered a comedy,it is very dramatic.Nothing outstanding but still an enjoyable two hours,I would recommend the Terminal if you ever see it on television and are looking for a decent comedy or drama,but don't go out of your way to see it. ",2014
1,"The Terminal is by far the worst Spielberg film so far. Not only the story is ridiculous  based on a true story that has a solid political/legal base  but Tom Hanks' portrait of this Western European man is also his worst work so far. Mr. Hanks - a good actor -being helped by the script and the Director portraits this man like a mentally challenge person, making this film extremely condescending towards Easter European people and foreigns in general. This is not a matter of language barrier or being in another country, is a matter of Mr. Hanks character's IQ. He speaks, moves, acts and reacts like a child or a grown man with a serious mental illness or simply like a stupid person, so the whole movie just doesn't work at all. Another problem is the Director wants us to believe that Mr. Hanks is an Easter European citizen only because he speaks with an accent; they should have made this movie with an unknown good foreign actor. On the other hand, the three characters that work at the airport and play poker to win stole objects are an African American, a Latino and an Indian man. If this is not racism, then what is this? Regarding the plot, it so unbelievable ridiculous that this movie can easy be science fiction. The true story on which this film is based on, it's quite different. It's a Hollywood obsession to change interesting stories to make then more ""American,"" making this last word sounds like more ""stupid."" Just to make things even worst, the only female character in the film is a flight attendant portrayed nicely by Catherine Zeta Jones; but in this film the character is having a relationship with a rich married old man another stereotype for the ""whore"" flight attendant it's just too much. This is just a very bad movie that insults the viewers with condescending remarks over non-US characters and stereotypes.",2005
1,another spielberg fantasy movie without anything going for it. ,2004
8,"*** Tom Hanks, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Stanley Tucci, Chi McBride, Diego Luna, Kumar Pallana. Directed by Steven Spielberg. Of course when the movie came out I seemed spectacle that a movie that takes place in an airport could even begin to be mildly entertaining. Yet in the hands of Steven Spielberg he makes it great, and contains that artistic appeal. Based on the true story of Viktor Navorski (Hanks;in his impressive role as an illegal alien) who gets stuck in an airport in New York and can't risk to step a foot out in N.Y without being arrested. While there he be-friends a flight attendant Amelie Warren (the beautiful Zeta-Jones) who he happens to have his eye on. Spielberg makes even the worst sounding movie one of the best of the year. Bravo on Hanks and Spielberg's part.",2005
1,"The tragic story of Iranian Merhan Karimi Nasseri is that he has been living in Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris since 1988; due to a complex bureaucratic mess regarding his stolen refugee papers. I was always interested in this story. I knew in advance that this film was loosely based on it, but I also knew that they changed many details to make it more palatable for an American audience (Iranian??? no! France??? no!). Instead, make the main character a simple-minded pseudo-Russian, put it in New York (NEW YORK!! America!!), and instead of a story about a refugee, make it a story about collecting an autograph from a jazz musician.",2006
1,"There are so many things wrong with this film I don't know where to begin. I'll start by saying that Spielberg and producers should be ashamed of themselves to make this film of such an awful, impractical, predictable, script that should have been presented as a tongue and cheek spoof rather than an overdone, gingerbread light comedy with sappy dramatic moments. The producers of this hackneyed film surely believed that all moviegoers are stupid enough to ignore plot holes the size of Antarctica, buy into situations that are so unrealistic that they are laughable, and be put under a spell by the script's trite gadget formulas that these screenwriters may have picked up at a seminar in Culver City. ",2004
1,"I simply shocked this kind of stuff ever made through the normal challenges of script-committees or approving executives. Unless Spielberg paid this 100% of his pockets, because man, he is off his rockers. 1. Badly mixed genres 2. Frank Caprish idiotic characters 3. credibility less of cartoon 4. complete illogical scenes and plot twists 5. Really really bad acting 6. Awful casting 7. As a product -no audience, no quality, except form of set setting excellence 8. Really bad script and misen-scene direction",2004
1,"I wonder, oh I wonder, despite the intention to present the original true story that happened in France long time ago, how come You Mr. Spielberg have spent so much money on screen-playing this story and you didn't pay attention that this movie will be distributed all around the globe, how come that You didn't pay attention on the non-English languages that are spoken in the movie. You have mixed 1000 languages, For example, Tom hanks is speaking at the guy with the ""pills"" in pure Bulgarian language, mixed with Russian accent, the other guy responds in Russian...total mess....If you want to make movie involving other nationalities, that Mr. Spielberg learn something about them or spent some money on language assistants!!! It's about money, isn't it?",2007
1,"I have just read the comments regarding this horrendous film called The Terminal. It proves that Spielberg, Hanks, and Zeta-Jones must have a million relatives who belong to IMDb. Anyone who sees this film and actually likes it knows nothing about film quality, casting, screenwriting, editing, musical score, and characterization. This film is a joke, and the makers of it are laughing at you if you saw it and said that you liked it. This film has no credibility. The music is dreadful. The actors are miscast. The screenplay is laughably stupid and on a 7th grade intelligence level. The ending is unbelievably stupidly written. It has so many flaws that one can tell that the movie-makers did not care in the least about something called EXCELLENCE. This film shouts, ""We don't care, but you idiots will like it anyway."" What else can I say to warn people off? If you see it despite my warning, and you hate it, make sure you warn others by commenting here on IMDb. Remember that.",2004
1,"Yes, that's all I can really muster for this stupid movie is one long, tired Booo. Do you like spending time trapped in an airport? I don't. Do you think Tom Hanks likes spending time in an airport? If you really really have to know, then go ahead and watch this movie to find out, otherwise I'll remind you of that time you had that delayed flight to Florida that had you waiting for over two horrible hours in that uninteresting and sterile airport. That's what this movie feels like. What's even worse is that Tom Hanks plays a Eastern European, so we have to listen to him babble incoherently in some made up language while breaking out in pantomime frantics with everyone around him asking, What!? So, once more, I reiterate Boooooooooooooo. If only I had some tomatoes to throw.",2006
1,"Tom Hanks' character in ""The Terminal"" is really supposed to be a rough prototype of the Slavic ""muzhik"" (this becomes clear when Hanks calls mustard ""gorchitsa"", which is Russian for mustard), but it is so misguided and blatantly stereotypical that it becomes offensive. I suppose that Spielberg felt that he would be successful in going for cheap laughs by creating this obscene American representation of a foreigner and I am sure that he did succeed with many people. Spielberg has sunk to a new low with this movie by making fun of a person's accent and his inability to pronounce words like 'cheated' (sounding like 'eat sh*t'). It seems he found an audience willing to consume this dross.",2005
1,"Although I've never much liked Steven Spielberg's films  (*Jaws*  being the sole exception), I've never confused my dislike with his ability to please a crowd.  The man is undoubtedly a showman . . . I suppose my quarrel is with what he shows us.  Even while despising his sentimentality, I've always grudgingly admired his sheer filmmaking competence.  In other words, I would never give his movies a 1/10 rating.",2004
10,"Although one person I was with at the pre-screen hated it, I absolutely loved it. I think it will just be one of those kinds of films (but hey, I also loved ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen"" which this reminded me of). Pure crazy fantastical stuff and I was completely taken with it.",2004
10,"""The Life Aquatic"" is most certainly an unusual film. It's something of a collage of colorful imagery, fragmented shots, quirky music, strange characters, bizarre situations, and amusing montages. But if one had seen Wes Anderson's previous films, one would expect nothing less.",2005
9,"What a stunning body of work Wes Anderson has created. I will be honest, when I first saw the previews to this film I was worried that Anderson may have gone the way of so many other directors who have developed their name in Hollywood. Art is replaced by money, which is replaced by angry fans. I saw the CGI fish and began to feel a sweat break with nervousness. Will he be able to continue the humor from Bottle Rocket, the darkness of Rushmore, as well as the ensemble connectedness from The Royal Tennanbaums? Well, folks, I am here to announce that he has taken the Hollywood money and has not veered too far off his signature course. I always imagine Anderson's work as a very dry martini. His humor, the most intelligent work I have seen in a long time, is like the liquid itself, creating this bold texture while packing a powerful emotional punch. The olives are the cast, giving just some extra to nibble on while you enjoy the entire drink. Place these elements together, the drink and olives, and you have The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou.",2005
10,"I cannot express in words how many different styles of film making Wes Anderson combined into this masterpiece. At one point hilarious, sometimes even action-packed, while other times, you may feel a tear forming. Wes Anderson deserves major credit for this new addition to his excellent films.",2004
9,The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou is a beautiful film. I'm ashamed to say that the first time I rented it I popped it out of the player after only a couple of minutes. I must have been in the mood for an action flick at the time. I gave the movie a second chance recently and was impressed by this film.,2006

10,"Well exactly as my summary says, this is a very well made straight-out unpretentious movie about a fading wildlife-film director's attempt to re-create his past success that made him some sort of cult phenomenon. Reading a few of the other reviews, I think this is evidently a ""hate it or love it"" film, however a lot of people seem to have missed the point-I don't think this film was really intended as a comdey, to me it was more just about the relationships and interactions between the various characters and maybe even an exploration of the human spirit.",2005
1,"After watching three-quarters of the movie and shutting if off in disgust, I was incredulous when I came here and read all the wonderful reviews of this film. So I watched it again, just in case it was merely a case of me having a bad day the first time I watched it, or perhaps the film all came together after I had quit watching it. I figured I must have missed something.",2007
10,"This is my all time favorite movie. The comedic intricacies are unmatched, combined with rich visuals and a compelling plot. I am not a fan of most Wes Anderson films, they tend to be a bit too subtle for my taste (DarJeeling Limited, Royal Tenenbaums...). However, Bill Murray hits it out of the park with his deadpan lines (I'm right on the edge. I don't know what comes next....I'm about to blow my stack). Understated performances abound which fits the film perfectly, which means the film may require a few viewings to appreciate it fully (it took me awhile to warm up to it). The soundtrack is amazing also, both the Seu Jorge (sp?) tracks and the Devo instrumentals. All in all, I feel this is Anderson's best work, and I know I am probably in the minority on this, but it's much better on many levels than his previous and subsequent films.",2009
10,"This movie got really hit hard by the critics, being immediately dubbed as a huge disappointment. This is due primarily to the fact that the joy and brilliance of any Anderson film can't be truly appreciated in one viewing. I remember seeing Bill Murray on a talk show say that he had just seen the movie for the third time and had just realized that Anderson had nailed the film.",2008
6,"I find this a hard movie to rate. Maybe a second viewing would make it easier. It's a odd film: one of these low-key black humor films which is a mixture of drama and comedy. What set this apart were a few other shocking scenes of violence, something not normally in this type of movie. For a comedy, albeit a tongue-in-cheek one, that violence doesn't seem to fit, but it makes the film all the more intriguing.",2006
1,"I had high expectations for this film -- Bill Murray is one of my favorite comedic actors; I loved Groundhog Day, What about Bob? and many other films with Bill Murray as star. The Life Aquatic is an absolutely terrible movie, not worth the price of admission or the price to rent. Not one other guest in the theater laughed -- at any point in the film. The characters all fall flat -- there are minutes upon minutes before any humor is attempted, and when it is, it always falls flat. Some terrible tragedies are portrayed as humorous, and even these scenes are not funny at all. It seems as if there is no point to this film -- nothing sustains it as it creeps along intolerably. I fought off falling asleep several times, disbelieving that a movie with this kind of cast could be this bad. An epically bad film, one of the top ten most boring, unfunny, and ridiculous films of all time -- based upon the actors involved. I am upset that I wasted two hours of my time and so felt compelled to write this review.",2005
1,Either I'm getting too old and out of touch with reality or most of the reviews and votes on this website are done by industry paid shills. This is certainly the worst movie I've seen in a while. Murrray's deadpan can be funny but only when he's juxtaposed with either an outrageous situation (Ground Hog Day) or with outrageous people (Ghostbusters). In this case it just doesn't work.,2005
1,"I do not know what was being attempted by this movie. If it is a parody, then it drastically needs humor. Bill Murray's character Zissou is an empty shell of a person who really doesn't care about anything, not even money or greed like Royal Tannenbaum. It is hard for me to see any resemblance to film maker Cousteau. Most of the characters are as one-sided as paper dolls. Owen Wilson's Ned is the only one who seems to have any blood pulsing through his veins. Basically, this movie is a vapid cartoon.",2004
1,"The Life Aquatic is pure pretentious trash, devoid of humor, wit, and even theme. With this film, Wes Anderson has proved himself to be one of Hollywood's most overrated filmmakers. Watching this film actually makes me question his sanity.",2007
3,"Whilst watching this film I found that I was so bored of it that I was concentrating more on my popcorn and the person in fronts head than the actual film. Bill Murray played the part of Steve Zissou far too seriously and didn't put any fun into the film from that characters performance, same goes for the other characters who were also lacking in interest and humour. This ridiculous plot should of been much more fun but the absence of any witty jokes or comical lines made it a real boring experience. Trying to find a huge shark that killed his best friend could of been much more humorous and someone like Peter Farrely could of done a much better job. Personally I would of had more fun watching a speech made by the queen about comic relief.",2005
1,"I've never been so disappointed with a movie in my life. There wasn't anything remotely funny in this film; only what you saw in the trailer which the second time around got a smile from me. Other that that the movie was dragged out and boring, with too many pauses, poorly written dialog, and too simple of a plot, with one foreseeable direction. Bill Murray's character is as boring as the one he played in Lost in Translation. By that I mean flat, dead, and lack-luster. I loved Bill Murray in Scrooged, Ghost Busters, Groundhog Day, Caddyshack, & The Man Who Knew too Much; but I wonder if his latest films are bad because he's feeling old? I hope not because I think he has a lot more energy than he's showing on the screen, so he should stop taking boring parts. I didn't care for any of the characters, and couldn't connect with any of them accept for maybe Owen Wilson and a young reporter on board. I felt the whole movie was dreary & depressing. The camera style, documentary footage made the movie even worse. I would'nt even bother to rent this one.",2005
1,"I wanted to like the movie, I really did. I know that the guy who did the movie has done some classics, movies that I enjoyed......and Bill Murray is in it, so I figured, how could I go wrong. Well, even he couldn't save it.",2007
1,This movie was terrible. Bill Murry should be immediately tarred and feathered for staring such filth.,2004
1,"As pretentious as it is unfunny. The first half hour, like the Tenenbaums incidentally, sent me to sleep. It had the same over stylised staged shooting and the same boring, dull, lifeless pace. With an almost identical cast the director has shown he lacks any imagination and still pines for the success of his only decent film, Rushmore; but has not matured since then. He hasn't learnt what made Rushmore watchable and his latest fiasco's drivel.",2005
10,"The thing that some people forget is that Wes Anderson co-wrote the script. the Life Aquatic is quite possibly one of the most original movies i have ever seen, and, personally, i loved every aspect of it. The score was spectacular, mixing Bowies actual recordings with the Portugese covers of Sue Jorge was ingenious. In my opinion the story bares some resemblance to that of Moby Dick, in that the main character is the Capitan of a ship and is bent on finding a sea creature for, at first, revenge... but draw your own comparisons.",2006

4,"In my opinion what this movie is trying to do is not to reveal the man behind the myth, but to make millions of dollars by exploiting a trend that has become extremely popular lately. King Arthur, Alexander, Troy, The Gladiator; what all these movies have in common besides exciting battle scenes of epic proportions, is inaccurate historical claims. However, some of the movies mentioned above, and others within the genre do not make the claim that what they are telling in their movie is history. In the case of this movie, it starts by saying that many historians agree on the theories they are about to shows us through this film. The truth is that the historicity of Arthur can not be proved until today and there are many theories out there, and the one this movie presents to us is definitely not the most popular, in the contrary most historians do not agree with it. So why claim your movie is based on history if its not? And where in hell did they get the idea of Guinevere carrying a bow? Come on! We all know that showing Keira Knightley half-naked kicking some Saxon ass is pretty hot...but still, was there any account of Guinevere being a post-feminist Celtic warrior-princess? I didn't think so. Hey don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to say that this is an awful movie, but rather that the claims they make in the movie are completely ridiculous. This semester we watched this movie in my history class, a King Arthur history class. The reaction from every student was...""Wow, Hollywood really doesn't know what kind of crap they are showing..."" Our professor, Dr. Christopher Snyder, is not only one of the top experts in the field of Medieval British and Celtic studies, but the focus of his research is based on the historicity of King Arthur! And to top it off, Disney interviewed him and others historians to put them as part of the extra material in the DVD version, but decided to replace them with Keira Knightley talking nonsense without knowing what she is saying, because the views of these historians did not agree with what the Disney movie was trying to say about the historicity of King Arthur.",2006
9,"Jerry Bruckheimer's KING ARTHUR is a shining example of that new breed of mythology adaption. It is similar to Wolfgang Petersen's TROY, in that it dispenses with the supernatural splendour and phantasmagorical intrigue characteristic of traditional tales, and presents the story as (relatively) realistic historical fiction, attempting to convey the ""magic"" of the story through drama, rather than gaudy special effects.",2004
1,"Long before I went into 'King Arthur', the latest Jerry Bruckheimer film, I predicted that the film would have three things in accordance with the Bruckheimer formula. ",2004
7,"In recent movies coming out of Hollywood there seems to be a trend towards attempting to unveil the true character behind some of history's most mysterious individuals. With most of us having been brought up on tales of a medieval King Arthur and the magic of Camelot, it was a risk for those who initiated this movie to attempt to expose the man behind the myth, so to speak. In my opinion, through a combination of realistic battle scenes, stunning cinematography and well rounded characters this movie is successful.",2004
1,A roman King Arthur with knights that still have their 'Morte d'Arthur' names even though they come from Iran do some very small scale heroics in the middle of a field somewhere in england. The three people who saw what happened obviously carried the story to us a thousand years later.,2005
1,King Arthur is ( according to Hollywood ) a Roman? This film belongs in the same bin as U-571 when it comes to historical accuracy.,2006
6,"I have just seen King Arthur and what a disappointment! I have seen heaps of movies, and I am able to stomach a lot, having enjoyed mediocre films like, Van Helsing for instance. Van Helsing at least was silly, but had no pretensions of being anything else, King Arthur on the other hand, is a little movie, very predictable, filled with plot clichés that you have seen in countless other motion pictures, but has pretensions of being something extraordinary. Well, surprise, surprise it is not! There is not even enough camp in this movie to grant it a sort of je ne se quois to make it enjoyable. Even the soundtrack is a rip off of Gladiator, without even fitting the movie adequately. Hans Zimmer should know better than to copy/paste from is own work, some of us might notice!",2004
3,I watched this movie several years ago in cinema and recently I catched it again on TV. It reminded me to be one of the biggest disappointments I've ever seen on Screen. One of the reasons is that I really expected something from the story but the movie couldn't deliver it. The movie is getting better if you don't expect any historical accuracy cause there is none. Great movies like Gladiator also don't have any but at least their sets and furnishing are looking marvelous. This time I never lost the feeling to see a B-Movie. So what they have done with the entire Budget? Even the battle at the end hasn't been photographed well. It's obviously only a punch of people fighting there and you don't get the feeling of a violent mass scene. Where are all the blood and death bodies? Arthur seems to be all the time on something like a heroic suicide mission. One of the most stupid scenes I've ever seen is the scene on the icy sea. The Saxons are portrayed as something like ancient Nazis. In fact they weren't. In reality the Romans and Briton's brought them into their country to protect them against the Pict's. The filmmakers didn't like the name Pict they changed a name of a whole population it into woad's. How arrogant is that? King Arthur is more enjoyable if you see it more like a Popcorn Fantasy Action Movie without any relations to the famous saga. One of the Highlight is the gorgeous Keira Knightley. Unfortunately it needs some time before we see her. I cannot say anything bad about the actors. It's not their fault that they have to say silly lines. I'm sorry even the second time King Arthur didn't convinced me. Some people told me the Directors Cut should be much better with better battle scenes and include a longer love scene.,2009

3,"Yes, I gave this only three stars. Why? Because the filmmakers seem to have lost sight of presenting the average film-goer with an engaging story or attempting to portray Arthur more plausibly. ",2006
1,"Here are the facts about the ""Age of Arthur."" The Roman legions pulled out in 410 (over 50 years before this film's period). The Saxons were INVITED by King Vortigern in 449 as mercenaries against invading Irish, Scots and Picts (note: they were NOT called ""Woads."") Saxons were NOT mono-syllabic troglodytes, but actually warrior-farmers with a sophisticated culture. After a few generations, the Angles and Saxons - led by Cerdic of Wessex - came into conflict with the Romano-Celts, led by Ambrosius Aurelianus. Artorius (Arthur) was apparently one of Ambrosius' generals. He fought ten battles against the Germanic tribes, culminating in the Battle of Badon sometime between 500 and 510 (40-50 years AFTER this film's period).",2005
10,"Controversially I think that this is absolutely brilliant. I think that it is arguably one of the best takes on the legend ever. The acting is second to none and the battle scenes are some of the best ever, how could anyone not enjoy watching a battle fought on ice. Despite the shaky accuracies places I still believe that it works on the grounds that Clive Owen gives his Arthur a very comely presence and maturity which is sometimes not initially shown in a lot of takes on the legend. It is also refreshing to see a feisty Guinevere in the form of Keira Knightley who gives the character her all and not to mention Ray Winstone's Bors who steals every scene that he is in.",2013

After twelve years on the job he has become quite gifted at discerning the most intimate details of his passengers' lives... just a glance at their clothes, and he knows.",2005
8,It is hard to lavish enough praise on the acting on display here from the two main protagonists. Jamie Foxx shows signs of the charisma and ability that made him a cert for the best actor Oscar for Ray. Meanwhile Tom Cruise is a sheer revelation as the psychotic but professional hit-man Vincent.,2005
10,This film could be a major turning point in Tom's career. He plays Vincent with cold-blooded charm. It is wonderful to watch a character stay flawless throughout an entire film and not be OTT with Hollywood FX etc. The dialogue between Vincent and Max is brilliant and the tug of hate they exchange brings out some chilling truths.,2005
7,"Rather contrived thriller. The most obvious difficulty is why a supposedly professional contract killer would go to the trouble of taking the cab driver hostage in the first place. Why not simply hire a car, change cabs between jobs, or try to do a better job of hiding what you were up to in the first place? As it is, Vincent (Tom Cruise) as the killer ends up with a very reluctant companion who he must know would try to foul things up for him. The only reason is to keep the two characters of the cab driver Max (Jamie Fox) and the killer together, which might make sense as a way of creating dramatic situations but stretches believability. However, if you can get past that, the very clichéd ending and numerous other plot holes, it's not too bad. I'll give it a 7/10 for sheer entertainment.",2005
8,This is a collision of two lives All collapsed in the events of one night ,2007
9,"Who would have ever thought that Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise would be an on screen duo? Well it has happened in fine fashion. Michael Mann's articulate direction and his obsession with nitetime LA have made this film fast paced an smooth looking. The basic plot revolves around Foxx as a cabbie who catches a stroke of bad luck by acquiring Cruise as a passenger. Cruise turns out to be a hit-man who is picking people off as his temporary employer sees fit. A wild ride through LA's nightlife gives way for a journey of self-realization for Foxx (whom dreams of his own limo company and tropical islands). The slick script and sophistication of the plot and character development always keep the audience on the edge of their seats. Although this movie has received good ratings, I feel that the film is slightly overlooked. Collateral serves as a great model for how thrillers should be made, and it delivers a great breakthrough performance by Foxx. Well Done!",2004

7,"What happens when a working class stiff - you know, a decent human being and a live-and-let-live Average Joe type - finds himself face to face with Evil incarnate? Well, that's exactly what happens to a cab driver named Max in Michael Mann's allegorical thriller ""Collateral,"" a sharply-defined morality tale that unfolds on the freeways and surface streets of after-hours Los Angeles.",2005
8,"'Collateral' features the career best performances of two seemingly different actors: Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. Cruise is a heavy-hitter; every one of his movies usually makes good dough, and a lot are good. Foxx, up until now, has been reduced to your typical funny black guy roles in nearly every one of his movies. When you hear their names mentioned for the same movie, you don't think it's stupid or impossible, just that the product movie will be some sort of run of the mill, action/comedy buddy picture.",2004

1,The Badness of this movie can not be described in the 1000 word limit imposed by IMDb so I would only describe some of the obvious blunders.,2004
10,"First off,Tom Cruise and Jamie Fox have the right stuff when your talking about great acting.I won't lie when I first purchase the movie I thought it was OK and then sold my DVD.About a month later I happen to see some interviews along with the making of this movie Collateral and thats when I decided to go back out and repurchase this great movie!I won't sell you on it but I will say its worth seeing along with all the extras about the making of Collateral.I never realize just how much effort was put into this film ,Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx along with the other cast members lay down solid performances. When you see Tom Cruise in this movie you see Vincent as he might had been in real life ,you feel the power in his speech and with his actions and thats what really makes this a great movie.Jamie Foxx takes on this cab driver acting role who keeps you on the edge of your seat most of the time and at other times gives you something to laugh about.If you haven't seen this movie Collateral then do yourself a favor and check it out,Tom Cruise just might make a successful hit on you,I'm giving Tom Cruise a BIG 10! Don't forget Jamie Foxx,hes a team player in this film!",2005
8,"'Collateral' is probably the coolest, most stylish and intelligent crime thriller of the new millennium. Again, Michael Mann has directed an established star--Tom Cruise, as the sociopathic hit man, Vincent--to what might be his best performance ever, at least in an action film, and has taken a relatively obscure and unaccomplished actor--Jamie Foxx, as mild-mannered cabbie Max--and helped transform him into a major star. And, again, Mann has done so in the kind of film that straddles genres and reminds audiences that it is possible both to entertain and to provoke thought about serious themes.",2005
1,"America's film critics have finally succumbed to madness. Collateral enjoys a healthy 85% approval rating on the Rotten Tomatoes site, yet it is easily one of the ten worst films that I have ever seen. I'll grant you that the average moviegoer will probably not hate it as much as I do - nobody goes to a modern thriller expecting a masterpiece - but I think it's fair to say that many discriminating viewers will find this film trite, instantly forgettable and deeply disappointing. Worse yet: it's boring.",2004
2,"This film held my attention for about 20 minutes, then it was one absurdity after another; one convenient plot manipulation after another that caused me to lose any semblance of interest. First: no cabbie would have such total independence from the dispatcher - we hear from the dispatcher twice - the first time he gets chewed out by Cruise (yeah, like THAT is going to happen) and the second time to relay that Foxx's mother called. Absurd. Anyone that's been in a cab, much less DRIVEN one, would know that you just don't drive around L.A. all night without checking in or there would be hell to pay not to mention cops looking for you. Cabbies get robbed and/or killed all the time, their disappearance would not go undetected. Second: the body left in the trunk - did Cruise just sort of space out that teeny piece of evidence? Third: good thing a neutron bomb hit L.A. that night so there was no traffic hardly anywhere. Uh huh. It's so helpful that targets in dark, noisy clubs sit where there is bright white light on them so they can be seen clearly not to mention the ease with which our main characters get away in the midst of the (eventual) chaos as the club empties out; the coyotes/wolves crossing the street, the subsequent awful musical interlude, the pseudo-psychological banter between killer and driver were enough to make me roll my eyes. ...And the list just goes on and on. This is not an adult thriller unless you're on meds that dull the senses. This is a mess of a film in spite of the acting being good -- the writing is just sloppy. There is nothing here that Hitchcock would appreciate, as some would assert. Hitchcock had plot conveniences and ""coincidences"" that would seem implausible, but in the hands of a Master, they were pulled off...not here, though. This is a good example of American cinema: ""people don't want anything serious to think about, they just want to be entertained for a couple of hours"". ",2005
8,"Over-used scenes on the subway and cat and mouse in a tall office block and comparatively minor flaws in what is otherwise a superb thriller from director Michael Mann (who made the similarly evocative 'Heat'). The story revolves around a taxi driver who is pulled into the tangled web of a trained assassin, much against his will. It is shot in DVD which enables Mann to produce very rich colours at nightime - not like the garish or washed out colours that are often what you get with celluloid night time shoots. It helps to produce a visually succulent but also very lovingly portrayed Los Angeles. The scene in the jazz club is so convincing you actually feel Miles Davis was there - and the subtext about jazz as a metaphor for life is one of the gems in what is generally a very tight script (about structure - but the important thing being the spontaneous melody that lies *behind* the tune). But the over-riding impact is from Tom Cruise, playing one of his memorable characters since his cameo in Magnolia. His performance is so convincing - he could be a role model for that type of bad guy.",2004

7,I'll try to keep this W/O spoilers... so here we go:,2004
9,"Collateral combines star power, great performances, top notch direction, a fantastic soundtrack and what is a bona fide contender to be called the best action scene in years. Quite simply, I can not think of a movie released in 2004 that thrilled me quite as much as Collateral. Collateral has Tom Cruise (Who rivals Sean Penn to be called my favorite actor of the generation of 40-something year olds) as Vincent, a smart, precise hit-man in Los Angeles to kill five targets in one night. He hires cabdriver Max (Jamie Foxx, in a now Oscar nominated performance) for the night and they're off. Max realizes that something is up around the time that Vincent leaves at the first stop and a dead body hits the roof of his cab. Upon his return, he replies that he didn't kill him, ""Bullets and the fall killed him."" Over the course of the night they make more stops, most of which turn into great scenes, whether they're going to a jazz club to off a guy or to a hospital to pay a visit to Max's mom. The scene I was referring to the best action scene in years takes place in a night club where Max and Vincent, some cops who think Max is the killer, a thug belonging to Vincent's employer who also thinks Max is the Killer, a cop who knows Max isn't the Killer, club security, Vincent's target and his bodyguards and a dance floor full of bystanders meet up. There is about five minutes of characters driving to the club that builds up tension beyond belief. When it goes down, it may be a flurry of gunfire, but with the setting of the club, the quality of Mann's direction and the coolest piece of music I've heard in a movie this year(Paul Oakenfold- Ready Steady Go,) it adds up to the best action scene of at least this year, topping even the car chases of movies like The Bourne Supremacy, Which I loved, The Matrix Reloaded, Which I liked, and I, Robot, Which I didn't care for. Collateral can be seen as an adrenaline pumping thriller, which it is, or as something more. For those of us who loved Mann's 1995 epic Heat, Collateral is definitely the latter. Mann makes references to heat in several ways. For those who thought that the subway finale was a disappointment, check out Heat. The nod there is that Heat begins on a subway platform and ends at the airport, while Collateral begins in the LAX terminal and ends on the subway. That is just one of several nods. When people have been saying stuff about the best thriller of 2004, they are frequently mentioning Collateral, The Bourne Supremacy and The Manchurian Candidate. While I consider Collateral a clear victor, I certainly understand why someone would mention The Bourne Supremacy, but The Manchurian Candidate was murky all the way through, had a weak ending and was a major step down from the 1962 version, which is one of the best movies ever made. I'll use the phrase that James Berardinelli uses on his favorite summer movies to wrap this up. When the dust settles, Collateral will be the best of this (Last) years summer movies. Sadly, Collateral only got two Oscar nods, Supporting Actor, Foxx, and Editing. However, that's more than any other mentioned summer thriller got. ***1/2 (Out of ****)",2005

10,My presumptions of a sequel to a successful original are that they are worn out and are a desperate attempt to cash in on it's predecessor. Look no further for conclusive evidence with the terrible Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen to know what I'm talking about.,2009
10,"The first and third 'Spider-Man' movies were simply fantastic.But it gets even better with 'Spider-Man 2'. It's full of action, has plenty of adventure, and is full of award winning special effects.Like any other super hero sequel, there's always a new villain.The villains name in 'Spider-Man 2' is Dr. Octopus.AKA Doc Ock.He has 4 mechanical tentacles that can flip cars and throw people at great distances.Does he remind you of anything? Of course he does.What does he remind you of? An Octopus... Duh.It may sound kind of stupid, but Doc Ock's character actually helps the movie become a 2 hour roller-coaster ride of a movie.Just remember that Spider-Man can do whatever a spider can.",2009
8,"It only happens very rarely that a sequel surpasses the original (Terminator 2, Star Wars Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back) and after the relative disappointment that was the original my expectations for the second film in the series had decreased. When I finally did sit down in the cinema to see this film I was a bit anxious. But my anxiety was quickly put to rest because Spider-Man 2 took the premises from the first film and improved upon them all. The first Spider-Man film a well meaning picture but quite as good as it could have been the second film is a good film for both hardcore fans like myself and the broader audience.",2005
10,"Wow. That's all I can manage to say after watching this film, wow. This movie really blew me away in all its aspects. The performances were top rate, especially Alfred Molina's portrayal of Dr. Otto Octavius. He really knows how to play that comic book villain with a sense of understanding so to speak. Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst romance is a truly interesting and different outlook on being a super hero. We often dream of being super heroes, and yet here we see just the opposite. The audience feels Peter's conflict between protecting the innocent and letting his own life suffer or letting it go and living the life he's always wanted. To get everything he ever desired, he must give up his double-life. Despite whether he gives up being Spider-man or not, he will still forever have to deal with the complication of his dying friendship with Harry Osborn( James Franco). Franco is my favorite actor in this film, a young millionaire dealing with the death of his father, his friend being the only one who can help him bring the murder to justice. And yet, unbeknownst to him, his friend is actually the wall crawler himself. A extremely well done screenplay. Sam Raimi adds touches of humor to the story and it blends in quite well.",2009

Suspense, romance, action and some quite nice Effects. Tobey Maguire is performing well, and Kirsten Dunst... wauw.... she is breathtaking...And only 22, so we can only hope to see more of her the coming years. Last but not least, Alfred Molina, who is the bad guy. He is very convincing and very very nasty. The computer-effects used are better than I have ever seen. Now you get the feeling of flying. I recommend all to see this movie, yes girls too. Remember.. movies are best in the cinema!",2004

Seriously, didn't anyone consider that she might have had a HEART ATTACK?!?! Come on, and then she hung from a ledge using a wooden cane? I'd like to know where in the realm of remote possibility this could happen. As the Marvel geek opined, 'Nuff said'.",2012
10,"I'm not a spider man fan, but I started to become one after the first movie appear. The second has some things that were missing in the first, like the appreciation for spider man's work. If I was a super hero I would like to have some consideration for putting wrong things right, so I think the worst spider man enemy is the press. This is just a movie, but in real life the press has also the power to turn a good man in ""the bad guy"". The other thing that I loved in the movie was the combination of the psychological with the physical aspects, where the first ones overcome the second, like regular people. The mind will always defeat the body and super heroes are no exception. The end couldn't be better, super hero or not, he has also his needs that can't be ignored. People say that behind a good man there's always a great woman, spider man has Kirsten Dunst, sorry, Mary Jane. That's all folks.",2005
9,"Spider-man 2 was a much better than expected sequel. It's better than the original with more improved special effects, humor, a nasty villain, and more intense action. Director Sam Raimi did a great job of making this sequel which is the best of the three films. Spider-man 3 unfortunately was the worst of the trilogy. This one however is definitely worth seeing because it's that good. Tobey Maguire reprises his role as Peter Parker/Spider-man and he continues to be a good choice for the character. Peter's now in college and what he wants more than anything is a normal life but his character feels a duty to protect people with his amazing arachnid abilities. Kristen Dunst returns as Mary Jane and she's okay in the part but like the previous one she isn't good much to do except eventually being the lady in distress again later on in the film. James Franco is back again as Harry Osbourn who blames Spider-man for his father's death. Franco does a decent job as Harry but like Dunst he isn't given much to do and his character lacks screen time. Alred Molina joins the cast as brilliant scientist Otto Octavious who after a freak accident becomes Doc Ock because of four mechanic arms melded to his back. Molina like Dafoe makes for a menacing villain and is well developed. Also his character fortunately doesn't have a corny costume like the Green Golbin did in the original. No offense. Rosemary Harris also reprises her supporting role as Peter's Aunt May. She isn't really given much to do either but Rosemary Harris makes the best of her limited screen time and Bruce Campbell shows up once again in a cameo appearance as a theater usher. The special effects are an improvement over the first one and so are the action/ fight sequences most of them between Spider-man and his nemesis Doc Ock. The one standing out is of course their fight that starts off on a skyscraper near a giant clock and then on top of a speeding train thats grows more intense as their confrontation escalates toward it's conclusion. The final showdown between Spider-man and Doc Ock near the end was a bit of a letdown compared to train one but everything else that happened before in the movie made up for the somewhat rushed conclusion. The pacing in between the action was a little slow at times and the dialogue wasn't the best occasionally problems that the original had too but this sequel is still a very good movie. It was much better than expected and I was fairly impressed with the film overall. Spider-man 2 is one of the best sequels (besides The Dark Knight, and T2 Judgement Day) out there with just the right amount of well balanced intense action, character development, humor, drama, some suspense, and impressive performances by the cast especially Molina that's sure to please almost any comic book fan.",2009
9,"Having enjoyed the first Spider-Man movie, I was looking forward eagerly to this movie, and to bluntly ruin the surprise, I was impressed beyond expectations. In a superhero movie, good action is usually a given, but a good story is hard to manage, and Spider-Man 2 honorably handles both these elements with a grace that equals Spidey's when he's web-swinging across the skyscrapers of New York City.",2008
9,"Comic book movies don't get much better than this. Sam Raimi once again proves what a great director he is with this sequel to the fantastic Spider-Man movie of 2002. And as good as the first movie was, this one improves on it in many ways. It's a fantastic continuation from the first one, fitting right into the storyline. I honestly don't think anyone could hope for a sequel better than this. Set two years after the first movie, Peter is struggling to find balance between his two identities. His life is falling apart. His loved ones are still suffering from various events from the first movie. And now a new enemy has appeared. What can become of all this?",2008
9,"First of all let me just say that Spiderman 1 was good but not perfect. The only other sequel I preferred to the original was Superman 2. All the regulars return but this time the villain is Dr Octavious played by Alfred Molina. In my opinion however I thought Williem Dafoe was better as the villain. Everything was perfect, the scripting, the acting and the action sequences. For an superhero movie it is also quite emotional but that just adds to the appeal. There was also the hint of a revenge subplot between Harry Osborn and Spiderman. Spiderman 2 is the best in the franchise so far.",2007

10,"One word: brilliant. The first one was good. But after seeing this one, I didn't want to leave the theater. The entire cast from the original has outdone themselves in this one. However, the best performance is probably Alfred Molina as Doctor Octopus. And the special effects are realistic. Especially the tentacles scene in the emergency room. This one has improved upon everything from the original. There's more action and emotion in this one. And the ending with Harry discovering the Goblin's lair is excellent, foreshadowing, and even scary. As soon as I left the theater, I went home and began waiting for the DVD release. And when that happened, I began waiting for the release of Spider-Man 3.",2007

His powers are temporarily lost for a while but when his girl-friend is kidnapped right before his very eyes he knew that he was in for a big battle with the man he had favored before he turned evil inside and out. The film was great it was just like the first film except that right at the ending Mary Jane finally saw Peter as Spider-man right before her very eyes. Now that Peter had ""lost"" his spider powers he thought things would run smoothly for him and his life style. But all of that changed when his girl-friend was kidnapped by the guy he used to look up to Doctor Octavius better known as Doc Ock by the newspaper Peter worked at. I was a bit scared of the new villain in town who was after Spider-man and his machine that fused together the tentacles on his back spine and messed with his mind to the point that he nearly killed Peter who revealed himself to Doc Ock when he sacrificed himself to save everyone in the city including Peter and Mary Jane but had unfortunately died of drowning to death. But overall great film and a good influence to many young children and adults of all ages.",2011

10,"After being very impressed with the first one after some skepticism, Spider-man 2 is tackling a sequel with great anticipation and even greater expectations. The way Sam Raimi was able to produce the story of Spider-man with such style, realism and above all, faithfulness to the Marvel original comic is tremendous to say the least. The reason why it took this long to make a live action movie for Spider-man is due to the difficulties in making the action sequences look real and being able to connect all the side stories and characters in a single effort. Although it doesn't look flawless, it is still able to fool the eyes. The characters are also faithfully represented.",2004
1,"There is a scene between Alexander and his wife Roxanne in which Alexander violently rips off Roxanne's clothes against her will, she responds by putting a knife to his throat and things are only resolved when Alexander speaks some gentler words and they end up making passionate love.",2009
1,"I feel i must make people aware that there are many of us who have seen this film and don't care if Alexander liked boys or girls yet still think this motion picture is absolutely, terrifyingly, obtusely and almost intentionally awful in every way it could be. Some may love the issues it touches on but be warned, you may just find yourself spending far more time than you would ever wish trying to tell everyone you know just how absolutely terrible you thought it was. The actors, although mostly multi-million dollar ""heroes of Hollywood"" are made to look like children in a bad school play by a uniquely hollow script. Even the apparent ""historical accuracy"" which Oliver Stone so readily tells us of is poorly executed and occasionally misleading. The Persian army are not a collection of brain-dead simpletons running randomly around the field of battle like they're being told to go in two directions at once (i mean, really Oliver, wtf was that opening shot of them all about?) To further add to the humour value Colin Farrell's pre-battle chat to his ""generals"" (mostly a collection of model-turned-actor brainless pouters) is filled with a marvellous moment when Mr.Farrel lists off every single Greek name of every general in the room and a summary of what they're good at in battle. The scene is so leaden you wonder if Farrell found a copy of Stone's notes on who was supposed to be in the shot and just read them out. It was like bullet-point history with no character or life. Every second moment in this film heightens it's own tension to the Nth degree as if to cry out to the audience watching ""BUT LOOK, CAN YOU NOT SEE WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE?!?"" I hardly think Stone's assumption that his ""film"" (i think ""moooveee"" is more accurate) plays well with ""intelligent audiences"" is anywhere near the truth. I don't know, maybe his Mom likes it. If you like historical epics don't watch this.",2007
7,"When ""Gladiator"" stirred a latent interest in films about the ancient world I was so hopeful we would finally be able to enjoy some exciting cinema about my favorite time period. I have not been totally disappointed. USA Television network has given us Attila, Caesar, and Helen of Troy - not without flaws but solid efforts. Wolfgang Peterson's ""Troy"" did not resemble the Iliad I had studied but I appreciated the performances of Eric Bana and Brad Pitt. Brukheimer's ""King Arthur"" could have used more experienced epic direction but was loosely based on historical accounts of Sarmatian auxiliaries and their commanders in late Roman Britain and I liked the grittier result to the fairy tale legends of my childhood. Then I heard about Oliver Stone's production of ""Alexander"" and I was sure we would have a film of the caliber of ""Ben Hur"". Unfortunately, Stone managed to take what should have been a ready-made screenplay and solid performances by Angelina Jolie, Val Kilmer, and Colin Farrel and imparted as much insight into the character and charisma of the world's most famous conqueror and military genius as the images of shadowy figures thrashing about in the blinding dust of Stone's Gaugamela.",2004
1,"You'd have thought given the amount of ancient source material which is still extant, dodgy or not, on Alexander's life that Stone could have cobbled together a story from the various accounts without resorting to simply making bits up (i.e Alexander being shot in battle with Porus), pointlessly attributing speeches from one character to another (i.e Darius's daughter giving a reply to Alexander which is actually that of Porus), having set designs which were simply ludicrous (i.e Olympias having the Ram on a tree thingy from Ur in her room)...I could go on, and on, and on...This film was simply awful on every level, the battle of Gaugamela just looked like a complete shambles, why did the Macedonians (Including non-Irish actors) put on Irish accents? A misguided attempt to mask the misguided casting of Farrell? Who was himself hammier than a pig farm but given that the script often stank more than the latter I loathe to blame him entirely.",2005

Well the battles were boring. The acting was crap. The music was annoying. Colin Farrell looked like David van Day from 70's group Dollar which is never a good thing. Angelina Jolie was just to weird for word's i wasn't sure she was even acting. Speaking of acting the movie seems to think that ancient Macidonia was peopled by the Dubliners, except Angelina i had no idea where she came from. The only good actors were the elephants.

The worst is undoubtedly the dialogue - unspeakable lines full of kitsch and pomposity in a style that Hollywood thankfully left behind somewhere in the 1940's. The other thing that sinks the movie is the pacing that is totally off. Every time the momentum picks up a little and we finally get into it a bit, we are suddenly thrown back into yet another agonizing scene between Alexander and his mother, or his father, that stops the film dead in its tracks because of the ridiculous dialogue and over-the-top acting.",2006
1,"i laughed out loud while watching this movie. i haven't enjoyed all of Oliver Stone's films so i'll give him this one. this movie left me wondering several things: 1) was Alexander's mother born before, or at the same time as her son?(and why did she go to a transylvanian voice coach?) 2) how much hydrogen peroxide was in the bleach Colin used? 3) did Val use plasticine on his face in the hopes of being unrecognizable? 4) did anyone go to the library to help with the pacing of this film? you know, those buildings with books in them? 5) was Bucephalous black, or white? did anyone care? (he was the best actor anyways) 6) if i had 9 figures to spend making a movie, would it have been this bad? (more proof that throwing money at a film doesn't do the trick) 7) did the people making this film know it was about Alexander the GREAT? did they know he was an extraordinary leader? or did someone tell them he was an angst-filled whiner? (see question #4) this film has my vote at the razzies this year for worst film. as i said i found myself laughing out loud. other leads turned the film down. if Alexander had been played by David Spade or Paulie Shore, i may have been more charitable of this mess of a film. please please, no more director's cuts or added footage...and by the way, i am a fan of most of the actors in this movie. what happened? but i stand by my statement about bucephalous. this animal didn't over-act, had a legitimate accent, and stood his ground with that poor elephant, who also gets a nod of approval from me. as far as i can tell, these are two characters who had no choice about being in this movie.",2005
10,"The audience is not being able to understand the difference between  ancient and modern morals, but to be honest I don't care about the  wider audience. Why should Oliver have to sugarcoat and alter his work  simply because the 'MTV generation' and mass TV watchers of the United  States don't know their history? I say he shouldn't. Their ignorance is  *their* problem, not Oliver's.  In a long shot, Oliver Stone chose to create a historically accurate  film around the life of a man, both fact and fiction, who created the  gateway for humanity's future path. Many will not appreciate this film,  because their minds are too stuffed with current calamity to realize  where their freedoms and dreams of equality originated from.   This is a brilliant film, which was portrayed correctly, from a  personable point of view, to create the character of Alexander in the  manner in which he lived; uninhibited by other influences save those  whom he loved and knew were trustworthy. This movie is about the  origins not only of the Western mind and intellect, but also plan  larger into the scheme of the man who saw and dreamt of the future- a  world which accepted each other and lived together in diversity in  harmony. This man was Alexander-- our Western father.   Like it, hate it; it doesn't really matter. The fact is, Oliver Stone  brought to his team of experts internationally respected historians to  make this film as accurate historically as possible. This should not go  without notice. Colin Farrell, a known Irish- now Hollywood loverboy,  does indeed display the heart and integrity of a natural born leader.  He has lead this cast in an epic performance, well past his personal  years and experience. He is worthy of praise in his portrayal of  Alexander.   The movie is fantastic;  Well done, Olivier, Colin, etc... Well done.",2004
1,"OK, first off Plutarch admits that in his account of the life of Alexander he was writing to teach a lesson (about 'civilised' moderation) rather than giving a 'true' historical account and therefore intentionally cherry picks scenes from different contradictory sources (a la Rumsfeld) to suit his point. Hollywood or Neocons manipulating history is nothing new, the ancient Greeks did it themselves. Stone uses Plutarch's theme throughout his film, don't be fooled by his placing the tale in the mouth of Ptolemy, Ptolemy was used as his main source by Arrian who wrote an altogether more honest and accurate account of Alexander's life and comes to quite different conclusions than Plutarch which while still dubious in their own right are demonstrably more trustworthy than a self-admitted propagandist.",2005
1,"It took me two nights (2½ hours total) to watch this - as I couldn't stay awake the first night. The story of Alexander is fascinating, but you wouldn't know it from watching this movie. (Michael Wood's excellent TV series/DVD/book ""In the Footsteps of Alexander The Great"" is a much better use of your time, and much more engaging.) ",2005
1,"I have heard pretty much nothing but bad things about Alexander, so I pretty much stayed away from it, but I noticed that it was sitting in my mom's movie collection and I just wanted to watch something new. I always like to give a movie a chance to see if I would enjoy it myself. Nope, I have to say most of the reviews on IMDb are correct, this is an over blown Ben-Hur wanna be. Not to mention, how in the heck did the casting director think that Angelina Jolie was perfect for Alexander's mother? Colin Ferrell, Colin Ferrell as Alexander?! Now I wanted to give this guy a chance, but seriously, Colin Ferrell?! Not to mention the strange film making, the constant story always twirling back into the question of Alexander's sexuality. I'm such a history buff, now if a movie isn't true to history, it does irritate me a little, but I just think, it's a movie, if it's entertaining, give it a break. Trust me, Alexander is just a bad movie and is an insult to one of the greatest warriors of our time.",2008
9,"Oliver Stone consulted Robin Lane Foxe, Oxford historian and the premier Alexander expert, before making this film. It shows. The film certainly ranks as one of the closest-to-the-real-story Hollywood historical mega-films. To viewers with any background in Aristotelian drama and the Greek epic, it will immediately become clear that Stone has tried hard to emulate the epic form while integrating the culture of the Greek tragedy into his film. There is plenty of fear and pity here and there are plenty of tragic elements. The aging Ptolemy as narrator even takes on some of the functions of the chorus/choir. Tragic destiny in a larger-than-life man plagued by doubts over his own decisions, his consuming passions, is the universal here; the gripping story of Alexander the historical incidental, as it were. Not surprisingly, characterization and character interaction must loom large. Which explains the numerous and lengthy monologues and dialogues. Bravo, Mr Stone. Those who can appreciate will. But I fear that hoi polloi will not appreciate. They will simply fail to understand. Postscript: If there were any episodes in Alexander's life I missed and would have liked included (at the risk of making this film even longer) it would have been the Gordian Knot and the Oasis of Siwa.",2004
10,"Last night I saw the movie a second time, with my 20 year old son. The audience was of an entirely different demographic than the first viewing (which was an advance screening). The average age of the audience was about 35-45, with not too many teens in there. And guess what? Besides the fact that the entire theatre was PACKED, there was absolutely not a sound from the audience...like they were breathless. No snickering at blond hair, eyeliner, sultry looks from Bagoas, or any of the things that drew slight laughs when I saw it for the first time. It bolstered my hope that as time goes on and more people see it, there will be a more favorable opinion of it. ",2004
1,It seems as if the whole movie was restricted on different levels. Some of it looked totally spontaneous and wild and sometimes it looked totally restricted.,2008
1,"After reading the comments on here, I have to say that I am stunned that anybody liked this film at all. I don't lightly say that I rank this as the worst non-B grade movie I've ever seen--ever. To begin with, all of the ""Greeks"" in this movie have Irish accents. Well, most of them, that is. Inexplicably, Angelina Jolie has a middle-eastern-meets-Russian kind of accent, and some have no accent at all. This hodge-podge of ridiculously out of place accents was so distracting that it was hard to stay focused on the movie. I laughed out loud when one of the soldiers actually said ""aye"" when confronting Alexander--I almost expected him to follow up by asking for ""me Lucky Charms"". I kept wondering how it was even possible that nobody in the production chain ever caught this absurdity and put a stop to it.",2005
1,"Viewers who expect an epic display of world conquest will be extremely disappointed in Oliver Stone's Alexander, which includes exactly two fairly brief battle sequences in its three hour running time. The film is not about conquest; it is an attempt to create a character study of one of history's most self-contradictory and enigmatic figures.",2005
2,"As Anthony Hopkins in a very prophetic bit of writing tells us ""His failures tower over others successes"" I believe that's also true for Oliver Stone you may like him, or not, agree or disagree with him but you can never dismiss him. He goes for it, he takes amazing chances. Naturally, the risks are enormous. Alexander is a misfire from almost every angle. Maybe the most important aspect that in Colin Farrell's portrayal there isn't a hint of greatness. If this was really Alexander he wouldn't have made it into the history books as ""The Great"" but as ""The Queen who wanted to be King"". With this I'm not attacking the gay portrayal. That was a fact, present in every serious biography of the man. I remember the Robert Rossen version of the story, with a moody Richard Burton as Alexander and a great Danielle Darrieux as his mother. The problem there was quite different. We had hints of what made Alexander great but the film was a plodding, solemn, unexciting little epic. Maybe this is one of those subjects that mere mortals shouldn't attempt. Not even Oliver The Great.",2005
1,"I'm giving this film one star for the reason that it has absolutely no excuse whatsoever for its wretchedness. With a cast like it has, a budget ample enough for three good films, and a legend-centered plot sure to pique the viewer's interest well before the movie is even seen, it delivers a seriously despicable, laughable fiasco.",2005
2,"I do like epics, and while I am not a historian I do take an interest in it. But Alexander didn't work for me at all. The best thing about Alexander are the production values. The scenery and sets are very grand and lavish, and the costumes are wonderful too. The cinematography, editing and symbolism are nice too, but strictly speaking they verge on being too flashy and don't add anything.",2011

10,"After seeing the Wayans Brothers in Scary Movie 1 and Scary Movie 2 I had high expectations on this film, not because they are comic geniuses or anything, but because they are one of the few toilet humor actors I can tolerate and even find quite humorous under the right conditions. White Chicks pulled out all the stops, and remains one of my favorite movies to watch till this day.",2008
8,"So I am not a fan of ""homeboy"" movies but every time I see this movie come on I have to watch it. I laugh myself silly every time. I cannot help it but the Wayans Brothers totally kill it with this one. It is so not about a plausible plot but about being extremely entertaining. With a great cast of characters. I definitely do not watch movies for hidden meanings, a significant message, or the artistry. I watch movies purely for entertainment and enjoyment and this one definitely fits the bill!For those critics who just want a meaningful just pass For those of you wanting pure laughs and entertainment!!! WATCH IT But why listen to me. make up your own mind.",2011

10,"White Chicks is the funnest film i have watched in years. Am i the only one who thought the made up black dudes looked better than the real white chicks. As for all the comments about the film being racist, cant anybody watch a film any more as a film , as a comedy film, and not as a statement of America right now. Remember its a comedy you laugh at funny things on film, you don't watch a comedy film to write a check list of every thing not politically correct about the movie, its a movie to be enjoyed by the masses not by the political correctness police, get a life people. I watch a film to enjoy that film, i watch the terminator and i don't think while I'm watching it, mmmm Arnie cant act, he shouldn't be in this film, lets have Dustin Hoffman play the terminator he can act, cause that would be and is stupid, watch a film to enjoy, thats what they are for.",2005
9,"This comedy is magnificent and is entertaining and hilarious all the way through. One of the best things about the film is that they didn't use the same jokes that every other comedy movie based on someone dressing up as someone else and pretending to be them. Also the work that went into making Shawn and Marlon Wayans look so convincing as white chicks must have been massive because they looked brilliant. Frankie Faison was alright playing the chief and delivered a few clever scenes. Terry Crews was excellent as Latrell Spencer and was a good touch to the movie. Of course the stand outs were the Wayan brothers which any one could tell even just from the trailer of the movie. This performance almost stood up to their roles in Scary Movie 1 and 2 which is really really saying something. Lets hope they keep writing movies (with Keenan Ivory Wayans who deserves as much credit, if not more, for the writing) and starring in them as well because God knows they can act and act brilliantly. Great movie. The toilet humor was well done too.",2004
10,"Americans are some of the most uptight folks on the planet. To the folks who think this movie is anything but funny, well you are hopeless.",2004
10,this film had me laughing from the preview to the credits. it is a prefect movie to watch when you just broke up with your boyfriend/girlfriend and lost your dog. You will be smiling in no time. The plot is totally unrealistic but that just adds to the funny of the film. Anyone who says this movie was not funny must have no sense of humor at all because everything out this movie was funny. I thought my stomach was about to explode i was laughing. The fact that they looked nothing like the actual girls makes it even more hilarious. Actually when i seen this movie my grandfather had just died and i couldn't help but laugh when i saw this film. Funny! i cant find any other way to describe it. Good job Wayans,2009
10,"This is one of my favorite comedies. It's an excellent movie. I even saw it twice and I laughed a lot. I totally understand why many love this movie, but some really think it's a crap. If you want to see a serious comedy, you won't like this one because it's very absurd. I mean how can two black guys transform into two white chicks and nobody sees the difference. The plot is very unreal, something you won't see in the real life, but if you pass over this things you'll see one of the best comedies. The acting is great, the plot is very entertaining so I recommend this movie to everyone who wants to laugh a lot and enjoy a great comedy.",2006
8,"I gotta say, this movie for me, is a classic. Even though it came out in 2004 i think it is a classic. The thing that in my opinion is even more funny than the witty lines is the facial expressions of the characters. They are hysterical. Trust me, they are hilarious. ",2011
7,"This is one of those comedy movies that you have to give the benefit of the doubt. Two black FBI agents impersonate two white socialite women - they are obviously completely different from the originals and yet everyone believes them to be Brittany and Tiffany Wilson. The plot is impossible and ridiculous, but you know what? At the end of the day, White Chicks is hilarious. This is classic 2000's style humour, similar in style to Hot Chick (one of my all-time favourites). ",2014
5,I would have never seen this movie if it wasn't for younger siblings. It's the kind of movie you don't think you will ever see and I saw it and I laughed again and again.,2005
10,This is just plain fun and will have you laugh until your insides hurt. Marlon and Shawn Wayans go undercover by using disguises in order to infiltrate the rich and uncover something bigger...only their seniors have no idea whats happening....,2008
9,"Let me just say firstly the title of the movie was wrong. It obviously made people assume that the film was about the differences between black and white people. I would say about less than ten of the jokes, out of the film containing tens upon tens of funny lines, was about the racial differences.",2006
6,"From the previews and my own idea of what the movie might be like, I was very hesitant to spend the time to even give this one a chance. That is, at least, a critical part of this movie. You must at least give it a chance. If you aren't willing to take a leap, then I doubt you will get much out of it...and even then it won't be a huge amount. Quickly from the outlandish premise, the characteristic differences of a rich white woman and black man are laid out heavily. This will form the foundation, one might think obviously, of the movie. Most of the movie for me was watched through a wince of pain as a train wreck unfolded before my eyes. Although, that is simply part of the fun and entertainment here. You know it is ridiculous, and thoughts of, 'Wow, how much worse could it be' seep in and you begin to enjoy it. If you are looking for shallow comedy, yes, you have found it...and there is nothing wrong with that.",2004
10,"One of my favourite comedies ever, it's one of those ones where you can return to when you're feeling a bit down and it will make you happy. It's just non-stop laughs from beginning to end, and if you're looking for a profound or intelligent movie then why would you watch a movie called ""White Chicks""? I've seen many negative reviews on here branding it ""racist"" or ""misogynistic"" well, maybe it is but it's definitely not offensive because it's so over the top how could you possibly be offended by it? Personally, I don't see the film as ""racist"" or ""misogynistic"" I feel that it's making fun of rich, elitist girls who only care about money and their image i.e. people that deserve to be made fun of. The only bit that I didn't find funny was the toilet humour, but that only lasts a short time and some will find it funny. So if you are not too uptight and want non-stop laughs then get this on DVD.",2014
8,"I first seen this film about ten years ago. I thought it was funny, but maybe a little immature. It was on t.v. The other night and I wasn't going to watch it but after fifteen minutes I was hooked! I'm not sure why some reviews moan that the story or make up isn't believable. Who cares? You have to go with the silliness to enjoy the film and all the gags. Two black police men are under cover and pretend to be young white spoiled white girls, is not easy to pull of but it does work and they are very very funny. The character of Latrell who takes a shine to one of the girls is the star of the movie. He is cheesy and has the worst pick up lines. He is a machine. I didn't think I would enjoy this comedy as much as I did. Go with it...",2014
5,"White Chicks is a funny but crude comedy and goes over the top a lot. Shawn and Marlon Wayans play FBI agents assigned to investigate the kidnapping of rich debutantes in the Hamptons. In order to fit into this foreign territory, they go undercover as young white coeds, getting involved with a group of high society debutantes that may be able to help them solve the crimes. The premise has to be one of the dumbest ideas ever but the movie doesn't take itself seriously and you can just sit back and enjoy. First problem is that after the transformation they look nothing like The Wilson sisters, but we have to accept that they do, since everyone else does. There are some really funny moments in the film but also just as many groans from the audience. Of course not all of it is funny some is way to racist to be funny and some is toilet humor which is the worst attempt at trying to get laughs. The cast is familiar with comedy and the leads Shawn Wayans and Marlon Wayans do their best and they are funny most of the time. Marlon Wayans is also the worst actor in the movie especially during the serious scenes. Jessica Calffiel is hilarious as Tori and I hope she finds work in Hollywood since she's really talented and pretty. The rest of the cast is mostly unknowns and may spark a laugh here or there but they aren't worth mentioning .Keenen Ivory Wayans wrote and directed White Chicks however Scary Movie 1 and 2 are a lot better. A lot of people complain that this movie is too racist but you shouldn't take everything serious especially a dumb comedy. Rating 6/10 funny movie yet it goes overboard with its 110 running time. This film is worth watching if you liked Scary Movie and other films of that caliber.",2005
1,"If this movie was changed to ""Black Chicks"" and had a white cast pretending to be black, this would have been THROWN OUT OF THEATERS!!! There would have been demands for apology and CNN would be covering the aftermath... But since it is black folks in white face, totally acceptable.",2016
4,"After watching this movie again, I found more humor in it but it was still lacking. I don't think I would actually recommend this movie to anyone, unless they really wanted to watch a scary movie. Some parts of this movie are very creepy, the faces are very awkward throughout the movie. There is a part where the heiresses walk into the pool party and the politician and his wife turns around, that lady has to be the single creepiest thing I have ever seen in a film.",2007
7,"Once every few years, you're presented to a slapstick comedy so hilarious you instantly forget how LOW this form of entertainment actually is. I can't give a scientific explanation to state how come it's funny to see someone (preferably wearing glasses) getting hit in the face by a ballit just is. Dodgeball is vulgar, crude and without substancebut your stomach will hurt from laughing and don't we all need that from time to time? In case you really want to defend this film, you can always say it features tons of unsubtle criticism towards modern American image of exaggerated health-obsession. Ben Stiller's character is the personification of the obnoxious fitness guru: 'We're better than you, and we know it'. Opposed to him, there's Vince Vaughn as the chilled-minded, lovable guy who owns a fitness center for the underdeveloped wimps. Due to his financial situation, he risks losing his gym to Stiller except if he and his teams of misfits manage to win the world-famous dodgeball tournament. The film is a series of cheap chuckles, eccentric characters and outrageous one-liners. It's pretty funny to hear Stiller yell out lines like: 'You're a skid mark on the underpants of society'. Or the always-amusing Rip Torn encouraging his team with the words: 'you're as useful as a cock-flavored lollipop'. The acting is great as it can be with Ben Stiller and Rip Torn who go delightfully over the top and lots of enthusiast cameos (Chuck Norris, David Hasselhof, William Shatner and even Lance Armstrong). It sure isn't Schindler's List but Dodgball is great entertainment and stress releasing.",2004
7,"Go and see it. It's one of the best comedies of the year and a lot funnier than it should be given the flimsy premise. Ben Stiller has a big 'Globo' health club worth millions (it even includes cosmetic surgery facilities - they know that 'fatness is genetic, like baldness or necrophilia'). The lovely Christine Taylor is his lawyer, charged with getting rid of the 'Average Joe' gym across the road so they can build a parking lot for Globo customers. She takes a liking to the 'underdog' owner of the Average Joe gym though, and helps them in their plan to win a Dodgeball contest in order to get the money they owe. Dodgeball is an 'obscure' sport that mostly consists of throwing a ball to hit your opponent (look it up on the Net - Dodgeball fans take it quite seriously!) Even when I describe the film, I think 'it sounds awful' - I probably would have avoided it if it hadn't been recommended so highly - and I recommend you stay till the *very end* of the credits for one of the best scenes (which also takes a swipe at the US film-making industry!)",2004
7,"When average Joe's gym, run by Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughn) is under threat of take over by White Goodman (Ben Stiller), La Fleur and his gym members must raise $50,000 to save it.

8,"Silly metaphor, I know. The film ""Dodgeball: A true underdog story"" while maybe be offensive at times, the film really brings it back up to place with the humor. You really can't help but laugh at the movie a couple times. Sort of like ""Zoolander"", another great flick with Ben Stiller, it's so stupid you've gotta love it. I would recommend this film for a good laugh. As of movie of the year or comedy of the year, no, this is not the film. But it was a good one to watch. A true film for any Ben Stiller fan, that's for sure. I will warn though, if you get offended easily, this maybe not the film for you.",2005

Stiller plays White Goodman and he is the snobbish owner of his up-to-the-style Globo Gym whereas Vaughn plays Peter La Fleur and he is the owner of Average Joe's. The gyms find out that there would be a dodgeball tournament held in a few weeks with a grand prize of fifty thousand dollars. Average Joe's need that money or else the gym goes to Globo Gym. The gyms ended up going and making it to the finals. But who wins? The movie will tell you that. All of the supporting actors were funny especially Rip Torn as Patches O'Houlihan. If you like Ben Stiller, you will like this movie. I rate this film a 10/10.",2008

First, it's a movie about a group of non-competitive and somewhat eccentric adults playing dodgeball to save a not-very-impressive gym from the clutches of a competitive monopolistic chain gym. Second - Ben Stiller. Stiller is over-the-top and hilarious as the evil nemesis of average Joe Vince Vaughn.

By the way, this is an ""R"" all the way, if any concerned parents are reading this. You need a computer to add up all the sex jokes in here and the last 30 minutes are really, really stupid.

There are several low intelligence laugh's and a few that you will have to listen to get, but all are just plain funny! I recommended if you want to laugh you want to go see this.

These actors have their hold on Hollywood and they basically can do most comedy movies they want because they have can make a good amount of money doing these movies. Other Frat Pack movies include 'Anchor Man', 'Starsky and Hutch', and Old School'. I'm not saying these movies are terrible or i don't like the actors.

10,"""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"" is just plain old goof-ball-ism, and it doesn't pretend to be anything else. It has the Average Joes gym going up against Globo Gym in a tournament. The Average Joes gym is clearly a working class gym, while Globo Gym's slogan is ""We're better than you, and we know it!"" Maybe for the most part, this is a recycled triumph of the underdog story - where against all odds the ragtag team defeats the big guys with all the money - but the performances carry it to excellence. Ben Stiller, as Globo Gym owner White Goodman, makes a really funny slime-ball. Vince Vaughn, as Average Joes gym owner Peter La Fleur, creates a very commendable character. Christine Taylor, as reporter Kate Veatch, is what a reporter should be. Rip Torn, as trainer Patches O'Houlihan, is one acerbic SOB (Hank Azaria plays his younger self). And I now realize that Fran Stalinofskivich (from Ramanovia) was played by Missi Pyle, who also starred in ""Bringing Down the House"" and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"".",2005

The man was a genius in the way he wrote, he invented the three laws of Robotics, as the very beginning of the movie tells us, they are: 1) A robot can never harm a human. 2) A robot must obey all human orders unless it conflicts with the first law. 3) A robot must protect itself unless it conflicts with the first two laws.",2004
5,"This was so disappointing. I thought the movie was truly inspired from Asimov's short stories... quite the opposite, actually. As other users have pointed out, this is a disgrace to Asimov master piece. The ending is so predictable and irrelevant. Beside, many would argue that such a scenario would have been examined by robot engineer. Nothing new with the trivial motto 'mankind is the worst danger for its own security'.

All the elements were there: 1. Rogue cop has to solve fallen friends suspicious death. 2. Rogue cop is restrained by unyielding, by-the-book police captain. 3. Rogue cop loses job while pursuing case yet continues investigation. 4. Rogue cop teams up with civilian. 5. Rogue cop and civilian follow ambiguous (at best) clues which lead to epic battle. 6. While battling hundreds of foes, Rogue cop has time for corny one-liners. 7. Rogue cop and civilian save world. Take this formula, add plenty of over the top special effects and some absurd plot twists, and you've got I Robot.",2004

Well, to be fair, there were robots in both. The movie plays like someone dropped a the scripts from Dirty Harry, Attack of the Zombies, and Idiocracy into a blender and hit puree. You've got a rogue, marginally unstable cop, an endless army of identical enemies, and a future that does not looks so bright. Sure, the CG and special effects are good but beyond that there's not much substance. Stick with the book. Unlike the movie, it has a message that will last.",2011

6,"""I, Robot"" was this year's most entertaining Blockbuster: a lot of action, witty dialog and a fine plot. In fact, I thought the plot was so good that it was a waste to turn this project into a Will Smith vehicle. Not that he ruined the movie or anything but his funnyman performance - and the witty dialog - just kept the story from getting deep. So many other recent Blockbusters were unnecessarily lofty (*cough*SPIDER-MAN2*cough*MATRIX2&3*cough*cough*) and could have used some irony. With ""I, Robot"", however, it would have been a great idea to go for a more philosophical approach. The direction is very spectacular and fast paced, which isn't a bad thing, but it doesn't help to create an intriguing atmosphere, either. The special effects look great for the most parts, except when they are used to create landscapes. Sometimes a location looks like it was taken directly out of a video game. Anyway, ""I, Robot"" is a fantastic way to spend 90 minutes, but it's no masterpiece and won't be remembered among classics who deal with similar topics (""Blade Runner"", ""The Terminator"", ""The Matrix 1""). Pity. The potential was there.",2004
1,"What on earth has this movie to do with Isaac Asimov? I've read some of his stuff, but other than his three robot laws, I see no similarities between his work and this 115 minute commercial.

Anyone familiar with the book will know that a film based exactly on the book (itself a collection of short stories)would never have worked and it is not his I take issue with. But the whole spirit of Asimov's robots is ruined. Most of his robot stories involve in some way circumventing the Laws of Robotics to make robots act in a way that seems to contradict the laws but, in fact, doesn't. They're logic puzzles basically, typical of Asimov. The I, Robot film shows no regard to the Laws having the robots not appearing to break them but actually doing so. The justification to this is that the robots have taken it upon themselves to make the decision that humanity should be prioritized over individuals.",2007

Unlike others who say that they were excited by the news this movie was being made I cringed b/c the possibility of a director making a fabulous movie akin to the Lord of the Rings is very slight. Others have commented that we true fans should loosen up and just relax and enjoy. What if the only reason we would watch this movie is because they attached Asimov's name, no matter that they qualified this with the word 'inspiration' instead of 'based'. Any fool would realize this means the writers pilfered the story for the best details and reworked it into a paltry plot. I signed a petition against this movie! Why do directors respect the work of K. Dick so much more than Asimov???? Asimov is a treasure trove of nuanced, intelligent and lively work that deserves better treatment! If Asimov isn't rolling in his graves all of his fans are gagging at every stupid commercial on HBO. A waste of time and money.

While all the other characters from this classic sitcom (Phoebe, Rachel, Monica, Ross and Chandler) moved on to bigger and better things, Joey was still stuck saying ""How you doing'?"" for another year. Big, big mistake on Matt's part to do this show, he should have taken the risk and moved on to other films and TV, but instead he stuck to where he was comfortable, and stayed with Joey. All the jokes had been used before, and you could spot them coming a mile off. To the concerned viewer: you have ten whole series of Friends to watch, why move on to Joey?

""Joey"" does not boast the golden team of writers that ""Friends"" had, and perhaps that is where it's lacking.

The storyline was fun to follow, the comedy was average but still laugh-out-loud, and it was a spunky sitcom to watch when you just wanted a laugh. I do not wish to compare Joey to Friends as most people seem to do. Joey premiered 2 months after the teary-eyed finale of the ten season hit, and viewers were still in mourning and not ready to move on. This was the major contributing factor to Joey's initial criticism. Once people got into the spirit of bashing the show in an attempt to mourn the loss of the six Friends, everything Joey did was not suitable in their eyes. Joey continued in a two year downward spiral as viewers lost interest and ratings declined. ",2013
10,"I think this is possibly Miyazaki's most intriguing movie. All of his other films are very linear and even though their highly varied worlds may be visually stunning and highly creative, I feel the dreamy world of Howls Moving Castle is by far the most captivating, bizarre, and imaginative of all the worlds Miyazaki has ever envisioned.",2005
10,Howl's Moving Castle is as marvelous and magical as Miyazaki's other great work. Something in Disney's advertising or the description I read gave the false impression that it was going to be sub-standard work meaning it was still going to be better than anything DreamWorks Animation was doing (Madagascar was sooo pedestrian).,2005
10,"When I read some four years ago that Diana Wynne Jones had sold the rights for Howl's Moving Castle to a Japanese animator, I wondered. The book (one of my very favorites, which I re-read at least once a year) takes several fairy-tale conventions and merrily turns them upside down. Ms Jones refuses to allow her imagination be neatly pigeonholed as hard sci-fi or straight fantasy, juvenile or adult. This story (as all of her stories) revels in word play. I really wondered how it would all come out translated into Japanese.",2005

3,"Up to and including ""Spirited Away"", the animated films by Studio Ghibli are of a high standard both technically and in spirit. With ""Howl's Moving Castle"", the soulful quality of the earlier films that peaked with ""Princess Mononoke"" disappears and what we get is an empty shell of a story that exploits typical Studio Ghibli motifs and themes and the studio's technical virtuosity. All the familiar devices of earlier films – a young female protagonist on the verge of adulthood, elderly women, a flawed hero with shamanic characteristics, heroes and villains manipulated by more powerful characters of uncertain quality, sophisticated flying technology in an alternative 19th-century steampunk world – are worked over in a fantasy aimed (cynically it seems to me) at a mainstream Western audience and the result looks very cheesy and manipulative with an ulterior message that superficially celebrates female bravery but channels it into socially restrictive roles.",2011

2,"In this movie, form is more important that function. We go from one pointless subplot to the other just so that we can see these wonderful and enchanting images of worlds we have never seen. The movie never comes together because the creators (director, etc) are too busy making sure they create beautiful images and scenarios. I don't see it as a poetic anti war movie. The book may do that, but this movie is not about anything. In the UK version it is not clear why Howl gives his heart to calcifer. It is not clear why Howl, knowing all his problems would be solved by putting his heart back in, doesn't do it --hey, the heart was always there! It is not clear why the witch of the waste wanted Howl's heart. And it is not clear why the Sophie's mother all of the sudden appears in the movie in the place where she used to live. What happened to the hat shop that it was empty for them to move back in. Pointless. I hate it when artists think form is more important than communicating with audiences.",2005
10,"Now I know why everyone was excited about Spirited Away, Hayao Miyazaki's Oscar winning animation, because his new Howl's Moving Castle, adapted from a British novel by Diana Wynne Jones, is more original and thoughtful than any American entry in that genre. The visuals of flat, classic animation with slow-moving characters and painterly backgrounds are alone worth the experience, the castle itself an imaginative hodgepodge of chicken-legged monsters from Russian folklore and cumbersome war machines from Star Wars. As the director has said, ""I've told the people on my CGI staff not to be accurate, not to be true. We're making a mystery here, so make it mysterious.""",2005
10,"First off, if you're at ALL a fan of animation, Studio Ghibli, or even just catching a movie that will bring you back to times when things were simpler and people weren't just up for the 'snatch and grab and screw everybody else', you need to see this movie RIGHT NOW. I will admit to being biased, since this *is* my favorite movie of any (animated or not), but honestly, whether you're 7 or 70, this movie is a guaranteed delight. Every time I see this movie, I'm immediately overwhelmed by feelings of wonder, delight, creativity, and hope, and I must say I've definitely seen this movie over 60 times. It doesn't get old, and it's one of those movies where every time you see it, you see something new in the background you'd never noticed before.",2007
2,"Sometimes reviews assume lives of their own. That seems to be the most plausible reason this film has received so much praise. Yes, it is very visual at times. At other times not so impressive. For example the fire in the castle could have been drawn by a talented fourth grader. But the real elephant in room everyone seems to be overlooking is this film has a very confused, hard to follow plot. In fact the director, Hayao Miyazaki, has as much said he agrees. So why do people sit through a film they really can't make heads or tails of and sing it's praise? Well, probably because you're supposed to. Slapp on the artsy title of animie and Miyazaki's name and you have critics falling over themselves to sing it's praise. I suspect the average movie goer will not be happy with Howl's Moving Castle. When you pay almost $10.00 per ticket you don't really care about credentials, you want to be entertained. And watching visuals just goes so far before you know you've been snookered. Instead, rent ""The Triplets of Belleville"" if you want to see creative animation at it's best.",2006
8,"The more you've seen Miyazaki's films, there is a chance you'll less likely enjoy this movie. Why so? Because you can familiarize almost every single element from his previous works in Howl, which is actually quite strange. Before Howl his films were ALWAYS unique and new, when compared with the ones he had made before. But in Howl we can (at least subconsciously) easily compare those black liquid shades chasing Howl to Spirited Away's No-face and the whole ambiance stands somewhere between Kiki and Laputa.

So my hat is off to Brad Silberling (the director), the screenwriter, Robert Gordon, and others for taking a stab at it. For they came up with a very decent film, if not what I had anticipated or hoped for.",2004
7,"I first heard of these books when I saw my younger brother reading  them. I got curious and when I saw they were making a movie was sure to  read the first three before seeing it. Right off the bat, I can tell  you that if you are a completely possessive fan of these books you  might be rather disappointed by this movie. The movie condenses books  ""The Bad Beginning,"" ""The Reptile Room,"" and ""The Wide Window"" by  slicing the first book in half and placing the other two inside of it,  like a sandwich. Of course in order for this to be possible the story  has to change to make it work, so some elements are not factual.  Combine this with Snicket's usually clever details in the book having  to be cut down and very loyal fans are going to be disappointed. The  movie also adds in a subplot that the first three books do not possess,  but that the later ones (according to my brother) do, so I was a bit  bothered by having that element ruined if i choose to read more of the  series.  I, however, understand the difference between books and movies, and  think that on the whole they succeeded in keeping the tone and  uniqueness of this series. Carrey as Olaf is wonderful and adds  something to a character that seems to be rather dry in the books and  the children are believable and easy to sympathize with. While humor  was scarce, the tone of the books is more clever than humorous anyway.  Overall my only issues are plot-wise and how this creates a choppy feel  to the film, but I don't know of a way it could have been done better.  The movie was well done with(as many are saying) excellent scenery,  costumes, etc., yet nothing made this film completely amazing. It is  however, worth the time and money and one should definitely read the  books. ~Steven C",2004

The film has a strong ""Harry Potter"" feel, what with the heroic, much put-upon British children, and the fantastical setting. If J.K. Rowling had cast Lord Voldemort as a nefarious villain out to steal the Potter family fortune, and made Ron and Hermione Harry's siblings, I imagine it would look something like this. Jim Carrey swallows huge chunks of scenery in his portrayal of Count Olaf, one of the most despicable villains to grace the silver screen in a while. The four child actors are all superb, especially the very attractive Emily Browning as the inventor, Violet.

7,"First of all, let me go on record saying that I think this is a wonderfully entertaining film. The sets and costumes are perfect; even the little details like the odd instruments on the car dashboard were carefully thought through for their effect. Jim Carrey is perfect as Count Olaf and his disguises, partially because he has always been adept at creating convincing odd characters with his flexible face and voice. The kids were likable, even the cute baby. Thomas Newman's score is a quirky mix that's just right for the film. (I want to ask him if there's a reason why one of his themes sounds like ""We Three Kings"" gone awry.) I'm writing this comment primarily to respond to the wacky criticisms of LEMONY that I've been reading here on IMDb. Most fall into two categories: 1) people who don't ""get"" the movie and haven't read the books (and therefore are offended by its dark tone), or 2) adolescents who are obsessed with the books and are disappointed that their little dreams of how the movie should be haven't been perfectly realized (e.g., ""the boy doesn't have glasses, so this movie stinks"").",2004

But I was looking for a movie to watch yesterday and decided to go ahead and give the movie a chance. While I still think it was too dark for a family film, I thought that it was still a great film and the crew did a remarkable job of bringing the story to life. Normally while Jim Carrey can over do his roles that have this type of character, he actually portrayed Count Orlof extremely well and did a terrific job. I'm in some ways surprised that he didn't get more notice for this film. He, Meryl Streep, Billy O'Connelly really brought Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events to life. The sets and costumes were marvelous and the story was a frightening but imaginative one that I'm sure any film fan would enjoy to watch.",2007

Lemony Snicket's ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"" books, in which siblings Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire start off being orphaned by a fire and then having things go downhill from there, embraces that philosophy with a dark, sly humor that is irresistible.

One such series was the enigmatic Lemony Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events.

There are more laughs in this than in another, perhaps more pretentious picture, ""Punch Drunk Love"".",2005
7,"50 First Dates is a very funny movie and for Sandler its one of his best. Adam Sandler plays Henry Roth, a womanizing marine biologist afraid to commit, who falls for the woman of his dreams, played by Drew Barrymore. Unfortunately, she has a brain disorder that makes her forget everything that happened the day before whenever she falls asleep, so every day, he needs to win her over and make her fall in love with him anew. The plot is nothing new as this movie is a cross between Memento and Groundhog Day both very good movies. What makes this movie work is the chemistry between Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler since they work so great together and make the film fun and also this film is better then Sandler's last effort Anger Management. Sandler is great in this film and he is one of the funniest comedians around today. Drew Barrymore is very good in her role as Lucy and she makes up for the horrible Duplex. The supporting cast is also very good with the best being Sean Austin. Rob Schneider has a small role in this film but he still manages to draw some laughs. The last main part of the cast is Dan Aykroyd and his role isn't very memorable. This movie has good intentions and some sad moments like when Lucy finds out she can never have her memory restored or when she sees pictures of herself from the accident. However, there's also some gross humor so I think this movie can appeal to everyone under the age of 21. Rating 8/10 one of the funniest movies of the year and a must see if you want a good comedy.",2005

Honolulu veterinarian Henry Roth (Adam Sandler) falls for Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore), only to find out that, due to an accident, her memory only lasts one day, so she won't remember him the next day! How will Henry cope with this? The movie gravitates between goofy and sensitive, but never gets mind-numbing; Adam Sandler always has something up his sleeve, and he and Barrymore have a great time with the material. As is often the case in Adam Sandler's movies, one of the characters is an embarrassment to everyone else (in this case, it's Rob Schneider as Henry's whacked-out friend Ula). Great fun.",2005

There's also a twist that kind of mixes 'Memento' into this whole story making it one of the most original romantic comedies recently.",2010

It is sweet and cute in places, and while certainly not a masterpiece it is above decent. A vast majority of the jokes work here, and that was great to see, and the direction was surprisingly subtle. The camera work was good making good use of the gorgeous scenery, and the soundtrack was lovely. I had little problem with the performances; Adam Sandler gives of his more likable performances, and Drew Barrymore is the persona of sweetness as his love interest. Out of the supporting performances, Rob Schneider guarantees a number of laughs, and Sean Astin comes close to stealing the film in places. But it is the chemistry of Sandler and Barrymore that shines through despite the flaws that mar it from being more than enjoyable.",2009

5,"50 First Dates is a watchable, sort of funny but nothing more. Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler have genuine chemistry. The film's premise, about a guy who falls in love with a woman with no short term memory is not very funny. The movie gets off to a slow start, with Barrymore's father and brother trying to tell her it's the same day all over again day after day. This part of the movie is not believable because sooner or later she would catch on. The second half improves because it has more of Barrymore and Sandler together. Still, I am not a big fan of Adam Sandler or Drew Barrymore. Sandler plays the same character over and over again. I think Barrymore is a good actress who has wasted herself in one mediocre movie after another, such as the Charlie's Angels movies. I think she can do better. A generous 5/10",2004

There have been a lot worse performances on film in much better reviewed movies. I tell you, you will NOT be disappointed watching the Director's cut Alternate ending. It is a story of how one action causes a series of reactions...no matter the intentions, be careful what you wish for. This film's biggest mistake was promoting it in the horror genre. It is NOT! It is a nice dark fantasy film, nothing more, nothing less. There are 2 different endings, with 2 different meanings for me. I preferred the Alternate ending in lieu of the Theatrical ending.

Going on it fall into the banality, always worse going to the end. It seems like they had this starting idea, but they were not able to evolve it for the rest of the movie, so it remain as an embryo. It become obvious and often pathetic. The only message escapes is the classic and obvious:""if you want to change the future it could be worse"". Another problem: actors! Incredibly not able to act, Kutcher (I don't know if famous in the States) is not ""strong"" enough to have such a responsibility, Amy Smart is beauty, but just that, Melora Walters is always crying, very far from the good interpretations with P.T.Andersson.

I am 70, and hardly expected this or any new movie to make it to my top 10, especially since I am not a fan of fantasy or time travel movies generally, but ""The Butterfly Effect"" has become my 4th favorite of the nearly 3000 films I have viewed in my life. The movie has many disturbing scenes, but the pace is amazingly fast, the acting excellent for the most part, and the characters physical continuity from childhood through adolescence to adult was the best I have ever seen in a film with 3 separate periods. The plot has been so thoroughly reviewed, I won't waste time telling the details again. Suffice it to say, if you can handle the elements of child abuse and animal mistreatment, (not graphically depicted) and can ignore the critics and watch the film at least twice, I think you will appreciate what a great film this is. And I have recently watched the director's commentary and deleted scenes, which further illustrate what an ambitious film this is. It should have been a classic, and it shows how off-base the critic's fraternity can be. Roger Ebert was fairer to the film than most of the others among major critics, but I think they were determined to knock the film because they didn't like Ashton Kutcher, and the film came out in January, which predisposes most critics to expect a bomb. Do yourself a favor if interested, and rent this Infinifilm. If you like an intense and entertaining movie experience, you won't be disappointed, and you may be enthralled, as I was, and hope you will be.",2011

The first time I watched the movie was when I rented the Director's cut version. I was fascinated, really stunned by this movie. It kept me wondering why I haven't heard of that movie before and the answer was that people didn't see the Director's cut but the Theatrical version instead. Oh yes there are no similarities between those versions. The theatrical version is a light version if you like, a version at the end of which you will say ""well OK nice movie"", but(!!!!) the Director's cut gives the real meaning of the movie. It changes the whole idea, it adds new scenes and omits others, it changes the whole movie with a new outstanding ending and the plot in general is more concrete!!!

DiCaprio richly deserves his first Academy Award.",2005

The direction, editing and cinematography are all the first-rate work by individuals who are clearly masters of their profession and the production design, costumes and makeup are the best you'll see all year. Their efforts combine to create a world of rich and lavish color, of excitement and glamour. Who wouldn't want to visit THIS Cotton Club in 1935? It's hard to imagine who could trump the technical team for Oscars this year.",2004
8,"Martin Scorsese's ""The Aviator"" is grand spectacle with a reverence for the nostalgic, set in simpler times. As a snapshot of Howard Hughes's life from 1927 to 1947, ""The Aviator"" is a portrait of a man of genius and unmatched innovation, and also a man debilitated by severe obsessive compulsive disorder and extreme depression. ""The Aviator"" has an amazing performance by Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes, and a mesmerizing performance by Cate Blanchett, who seems to inhabit the role of Katherine Hepburn-- the love of Hughes's life. However, the one indelible image I have of the film is the scene in which Hughes is frozen in the men's restroom, because he can't make himself touch the door knob for fear of germs and contamination. Granted this was a time before obsessive compulsive disorder existed as a diagnosis. The scene is intended as a dramatic arc, distinguishing a tragic flaw in Hughes. However, for me it seemed overly indulgent, and was curious regarding the scene length. Much like most of the nearly 3 hour movie, this is an exercise in indulgence, and attention to detail that is only that. Scorsese's balance between Hughes's genius and his great suffering is good melodrama, but not very inspiring. I have a particular affinity for Howard Hughes the man. Had John Lone's (and Michael Mann's) story followed Hughes through the 1950's and beyond, the story would be even sadder. ""The Aviator"" illustrates the highs of genius, and the abyss of near insanity. This is an accurate depiction of an amazing man's life, but it is skewed toward the broken aspect. So just personally for me, it was frustrating to watch. To Scorsese's credit, one gets that he has immense compassion for Howard Hughes.",2005
10,"Leonardo Dicaprio, once again, shows his depth as an artist and his ability to carry a film. He deserves the Golden Globe, and his due as an outstanding actor. Howard Hughes, the man, remains a mystery and the portrayal of his obsessive compulsive disorder was a powerful view into his inner hell. The beginning scene set the pace for a journey into his privileged and dark world. The Aviator showed the torments and gifts of genius. Amazing job by all involved!

This is the movie that made people forget his role in Titanic and respect him as the amazing actor he is. I also really liked the costumes and music.

8,"""The Aviator""--a biopic of Howard Hughes-- is clearly one of Scorsese's lesser works. Still, a lesser work from Scorsese is far superior to the greatest work of your average director. Here's the rundown:",2005
10,"Scorsese does it again with this period piece detailing the life of the eccentric millionaire Howard Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio). The film opens with Howard directing his 1930 war epic, ""Hell's Angels."" Which took 3 years and 4 million dollars to make (not a small chunk of change back then, not even that small now). The movie moves to his meeting and subsequent courting of Katharine Hepburn, played exceptionally well by Cate Blanchett. It also depicts him moving on to the likes of Ava Gardner and Faith Domergue. ""The Aviator"" shows us the many aspects of Hughes' being, both good and bad. He is a dreamer, sparing no expense to make his movies or build his aviation empire, despite the financial trouble it causes the company which he inherited from his family that is based in Houston (the name of the company escapes me. We also see his obsessive compulsive nature, afraid of contracting germs and constantly trying to stay as clean as possible. When Errol Flynn grabs a pea off of Hughes' plat with a nice cut of meat on it, Hughes pushes it aside with only one bite gone. Also, Hughes is contracted by the government to make fighter planes and an ""air-boat,"" a giant airplane that can transport the troops, their equipment, and transportation across the Atlantic so that German u-boats will stop taking down U.S. submarines and ships. He call's it ""The Hercules."" The project takes too long, and it isn't completed in time to help in the war. Well, Hughes' new airline TWA doesn't amuse the big wigs at Pan Am Airlines, so their owner uses his personnel senator (Leon Brewster of Maine) to get a bill before Congress to put a monopoly on international aviation travel. Hughes takes on Brewster and his hearing and wins, then he takes the maiden voyage of his ""Spruce Goose,"" as Brewster called it, and retires the vessel forever. If you didn't know who Hughes was before this movie, then it will give you a great foundation on which to build knowledge of this quite intelligent, quite intriguing man. DeCaprio turns in a superb performance, further distancing himself from his teeny-bopper early years. He has definitely changed my opinion of him with his last three movies (Gangs of New York, Catch Me If You Can, and The Aviator). I realize he might have been good in earlier movies (though don't you dare say ""Basketball Diaries,"" which sucked), but I haven't seen them all.",2005
8,Martin Scorsese's most recent ambitious project does not disappoint.,2004
9,"Before Howard Hughes was a recluse so reclusive as to out-Salinger J.D. Salinger, he was a big time stud, who made big movies, flew fast planes, and courted gorgeous ladies; so say Martin Scorsese and John Logan, architects of this latest Hollywood biopic.' Leonardo DiCaprio continues his trend of turning in great performances with great directors, playing Howard Hughes between 1927 and 1947, the years where Hughes conquered the worlds of film and aviation, making room for romance with Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) and Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale). In later years, Hughes's mental problems would become legendary; at this stage in the game, he suffers only from pronounced germ phobia and mild obsessive-compulsive disorder. This is all expertly depicted by Scorsese, Logan, and DiCaprio. Stealing all her scenes is Cate Blanchett, who should start making room on her mantle for her Best Supporting Actress Oscar. It couldn't have been easy to play an iconic movie star like Katharine Hepburn, but Blanchett aces it. Kate Beckinsale, Kelli Garner (Faith Demorgue), and Gwen Stefani (Jean Harlow) are the other women in Howard's life, although none are as clearly defined as Blanchett/Hepburn. The villains of the piece are Alec Baldwin and Alan Alda, playing, respectively, Pan-American Airways CEO Juan Trippe and Trippe's bought-and-paid-for politician, Senator Ralph Owen Brewster. Both excel, with Alda coming off as both slimy and goofy at the same time. Alec Baldwin, like Cate Blanchett, steals every scene he has, playing Trippe as a delightfully suave villain. In his final scene he delivers a wonderful monologue on the future of Hughes's Trans-World Airline, and caps it off with the most hysterical use of the F word in many years. Also appearing: the dependable John C. Reilly as Hughes's business manager Noah Dietrich; Jude Law, who apparently can't go two weeks without seeing himself in a different movie, as movie legend Errol Flynn; Brent Spiner (yay!) as airplane executive Robert Gross; and Willem Dafoe as a photographer. ""The Aviator"" is overlong, and drags in places, but it is a great movie. I rate it a 9/10.",2004

9,"When it comes to film, my love is primarily focused on two things. I can be swayed and amazed by brilliant metaphors and symbolisms and fantastic technical aspects, but a film is nothing to me without two key ingredients. First, I need power in the performances. Be it subtle inner pain or explosive intensity, it's practically impossible for me to love a film if it doesn't feature some great performances or at least a brilliant one in the lead. Secondly, and most importantly, is the story. The thing I love most about film is the ability it has to immerse me into a story and take me on a journey outside of my own world. Be it through wild comedic adventure, an action-filled extravaganza, a deep, emotional story about characters or a powerful epic drama, I have to love a story to love a film. Luckily for me, The Aviator features a magnificent story of a very complex individual and is anchored by one of the finest performances I've ever seen in the form of Leonardo DiCaprio. While it does have flawless technical aspects (including a score that never ceases to amaze), the film is founded on these two elements. As you well know, Scorsese's film tells the story of the infamous Howard Hughes who led a life full of beautiful women and a huge amount of money to do whatever he pleased with. Hughes decided to put this money towards his huge ambition and his love for film and, more importantly, aviation.",2008

The Aviator soars on all these aspects as it captures the most glorious slice of the life of Howard Hughes, the filmmaker, aviation innovator, and mentally unstable billionaire.",2007

I was disappointed by Scorsese's previous film and was expecting this one to be the same ploddingly well shot film. Thank god it wasn't. This film hits all cylinders and never misses a beat. ALL of the actors do a fantastic job especially Cate Blanchett as Katherine Hepburn. The film however revolves around Howard Hughes and we see his highs and his lows. The Aviator has throwback feel and look to it complemented by special effects that weave their way into the film seamlessly. At just under three hours long its is paced well and the time goes by without dragging. It really is a good film that deserves all of the attention that it is getting and I recommend it to everyone.,2005
10,"Martin Scorsese's ""heroes"" usually aren't heroes at all; rather they end up being only one of the unbalanced characters through whom we see the entire film. Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, The Last Temptation, Goodfellas, Casino, Bringing out the Dead and Gangs of New York--who would want to really be any of these guys? Even Jesus has issues.",2005
10,"Leave it to Martin Scorsese, he is one of the few reliable directors who graces in age, still manages to make outstanding movies. I thought his previous film; GANGS OF NEW YORK was the best film of 2002 (and still stand by that comment). Scorsese who was once known for showing us the gritty realistic world of New York City's ""Mean Streets"" with the Little Italy thugs (MEAN STREETS), anti-hero loners (TAXI DRIVER), fallen hero (RAGING BULL), bizarre world of Soho (AFTER HOURS), realistic thugs (GOODFELLAS), gangsters controlling Las Vegas (CASINO; it wasn't in NYC, but it still had the similar theme), guilt ridden paramedic (BRINGING OUT THE DEAD), and the war between immigrants (GANGS OF NEW YORK). This is the Scorsese that all of us know about and remember. Yet Scorsese was also responsible for telling us about a single mother in the southwest struggling to survive (ALICE DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE), the final farewell concert of a fantastic rock/folk group The Band (THE LAST WALTZ), and the story of Jesus Christ (LAST TEMPTATION OF Christ). Now Scorsese has become the storyteller of one of the most enthusiastic and eccentric billionaires of recent years, Howard Hughes.",2004
7,"Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the best actors of his generation. Martin Scorsese is the greatest director of all time. They have made a formidable pair over the years and sometimes I think DiCaprio is miscast for certain roles (""Gangs of New York,"" ""The Departed""), but ""The Aviator"" has DiCaprio's name all over it. This is one of the best, if not thee best, acting performances I have seen since Robert De Niro in ""Raging Bull."" Both characters have their similarities as well. Jake La Motta had his own inner demons which lead to his paranoia about his wife which ultimately lead to the destruction of the people around him and Howard Hughes' demons are brought front and center as we see where it all starts when he's given a bath at an age where the young Howard should be more than capable to cleaning himself. His mother tells him about all the diseases and makes him spell the word ""quarantine."" In this unsettling opening scene we see where his delusions start. ",2008
9,"This movie is important to me. I realize that, as a relatively high budget and heavily marketed film, certain facets of this biopic have been sensationalized. However, the image this movie constructs of the great modern eccentric Howard Hughes is fascinating.",2006
10,"I am writing to say that ""The Aviator"" should have gotten the Best Picture"" Oscar. The Aviator is a riveting, non-stop emotional picture from beginning to end. It almost seems Howard Hughes is at the helm in producing this picture. It has his intensity, his non-stop energy, his emotional ups and downs, his vibrant colorful life and tragedy. To even compare this fast-paced picture to ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a sacrilege in my opinion. ""Million Dollar Baby"" had my mother asleep and me wanting to get there. The pace is SO>>>>>>slow, the actors only mediocre in my opinion. The script was so simplistic compared to the intriguing lines of the ""Aviator."" I thought Leonardo DeCaprio was par excellence as Howard. He put an incredible piece of himself into a very complicated character and came off very believable in my opinion. Thank you for letting me share my comments.",2005
6,"The Aviator like the Spruce Goose itself only takes flight briefly and is an overall disappointment. The thrills to be had are in the flight sequences. However they are done digitally and in the editor's suite. Scorsese's hand is rather flat on the throttle and the script plays too broadly. You get the feeling that Scorsese himself is not quite in love with his subject, Howard Hughes. The scenes that should work such as Hughes caressing the rivets of a plane are seen through a cynical eye. DiCaprio portray's Hughes as a nut and sociopath. Maybe he was in real life but it's as if they want you to not like this guy. Not exactly the right approach to making an audience friendly picture. We also have a poor sense of continuity. After suffering massive wounds from a plane crash, Howard Hughes heals up amazingly well and quickly. Totally glanced over is the fact that he became addicted to morphine after this event. If 75% of your body is burned and your heart has been dislocated to the other side of your chest cavity I think you're going to care more about killing the pain instead of washing your hands.",2004
6,"I went to see this movie with very high expectations. It was supposed to be a certain Best Picture nominee that would finally get Scorcese his Best Director Oscar, and possibly the best picture Oscar too. Given the history of the Oscars, it will not surprise me if Scorcese wins the Oscar for his not so good effort. IMO neither the movie nor the direction lives upto the hype. Half way through the movie, I was bored to death. When it finally ended, with DiCaprio saying the same sentence 20+ times (it was quite irritating), I heaved a sigh of relief. There is too much detail, not enough pace, and the screenplay is nothing to write home about. There is some good acting, which may be the only saving grace of this movie. Dicaprio brings out the eccentricity of the main character quite well, but the story never really takes off. One good scene in the movie is when the Howard Hughes character has to defend himself. Leo carried that scene well. Overall, a HUGE disappointment.",2004
10,"Truly a spectacular in the sense of capturing the essence of an age and of Hughes himself. While not factual in its day-to-day of Hughes' life, the film reveals the man in his genius, obsessions and eventual decline. Scorsese and DiCaprio are to be congratulated.",2005
10,"I only really like 3 movies, and this is one of them. I think this is an amazing movie. It was compelling, and captured my emotions within the first ten minutes. I just love everything about it-the story, the music, the acting, and the way it was filmed in general. Howard Hughes was such an amazing figure in history, and I think this movie captured the main sides of him, portraying him as the genius and billioniare that he was without leaving out or dwelling too much on what he became in his later years. If you haven't seen this movie, you are missing out. I don't know a lot about filming, but whoever directed this is probably one of the greatest directors of our time.",2006
9,"When i learnt there was to be a second spin-off of csi, i was really looking forward to it......thankfully i was not disappointed. This show is certainly different from the original csi as we learn more about the characters but not all at once leaving some room for us to wonder about them. The acting and stories of the show are superb, Gary Sinise portrays Mac Taylor a likable character who is still dealing with the loss of his wife in 9/11, who i feel has the potential to match Grissom of the original, particularly as Petersen's contract is up in 2006. He has strong support from the rest of the cast including Melina (sorry can't spell her last name) as Stella.",2005
8,"I absolutely LOVE the original CSI. I really can't watch CSI Miami - just a bit too much. So when they announced there was a third one coming out I was skeptical. But they've out done themselves! Although the original is still my favorite, this one steps away from the CSI format a bit. There's more of a glimpse into the characters and great story lines. There isn't the condescending tone that Miami has. Gary Sinise is, of course, brilliant as usual. If they keep it up this one will stick around. Combine this one and the original and I could watch all week! No one can beat Grissom, but Taylor is certainly going to give him a run for his money. Now a combined episode would be phenomenal!",2004
9,"Wow, what have we done to deserve this, another fantastic series from what has shaped up to be one of the best franchise's on television, CSI:NY has everything that a good cop show needs; strong leading characters, well thought out stories and above all else, cinematic production values, like the previous two series do. That it isn't to say that the show had the best start. I'll admit to being balled over by the pilot/crossover episode during CSI:Miami's second season and I couldn't wait to see how it would transpire as a fully fledged series. Initially however, the series did have a rough start. The show just seemed too dark and gloomy and any humour seemed to sit at odds with the show's dark milieu, but things happily changed as the first season progressed and by the end of it's freshman year I would have to say that CSI:NY was truly one of the best shows on the box, more than giving its sister series a run for their money.",2006
10,"I love the CSI series, but CSI:NY is my definite favorite. There's much more character development than in the other series. You can actually follow the characters one by one, and get to know them. It's in many ways more human. For example, in CSI:Miami, Horatio Caine is presented as an almost clairvoyant person: He walks into a crime scene, and just by looking at some blood traces, he can say: ""No, I don't think our victim went over here to call the police - he was going to warn his son who he thought was asleep. But his soon was at a party in town."" CSI:NY is much more down to ground. Not to mention, it's much more bright and colorful. Compared to L.V., where even the labs and offices are like dark tunnels, the settings and locations in N.Y. is much brighter. For me, this makes the program easier to watch.",2006
1,"This show is so dumb it doesn't deserve to be related to CSI. The characters are as wooden as Pinocchio, and the performances are worse. I live in NYC, and I have NEVER met anyone with the accents of Detectives Danny Messer or Don Flack -- seriously, I don't care that both of these actors were born here, their accents are so heavily affected they're ridiculous. But even worse than the accents is the unrealistic technology these detectives use. The NYPD barely has computers built after 1990 and they absolutely don't have Dick Tracy video phones, 3-D video projection, spacious offices with glass walls, and time to spend days on a single case. Yes, it's only TV, but it has absolutely nothing to do with New York City or the NYPD.",2009
8,"CSI New York is as good as the other CSI shows and follows in their footsteps as not being for the squeamish. If you like the intrigue and the puzzles of the original, you should like this one too. You get to know a little more about the characters than the original, yet it is not as dramatic or glitzy as the Miami show. It is really a nice balance with different writing but the same interesting stuff. Some of the graphic detail is less on the scientific side and more on the gruesome, man-we-live-in-a-screwed-up-world side. It does get annoying that someone always has some bit of knowledge that cracks the case. They rarely have to do any real digging. In the real world, I am sure that most cases do not pose much in the way of challenge, yet when they do I am also sure that there is some serious research going on. I gave it a score of eight because it is really good. It is not the best show I have ever seen in my life, but I watch it every week. I watch maybe 4-5 hours of TV each week, and one of those hours is for CSI New York.",2006
10,"I think, of all 3 shows, this one has some style: As each CSI show has, over the last 9 years, developed a kind of personality - I like the way the graphics are done in the ""discovery"" shots (The little ""bridge"" shots that show the various CSIs working and the evidence being collected) - As Danny always says, ""Boom"".",2009
10,"All I can say is WOW! I can't stop watching this show! Many of you guys don't agree with of what I say that CSI:NY is better than Las Vegas and trust me, it is. I've seen four seasons of CSI Las Vegas and so far CSI:NY is much better than CSI:Las Vegas.",2006

10,"In my opinion, NY has emerged, by the end of it's sophomore season, as the best of the franchise. The characters are all likable and believable, with flaws that make them more human (much better than the holier-than-thou Perfect Grissom. Ugh). This show started giving character background and development much earlier than the other 2 shows, so I found it easier to get to know and like them more, right from the start. Sinise of course is terrific as the tough minded but fair Mac, and I'm glad to see him less stoic in season 2, and allowing some dry humor to show through. Kanakaredes, Cahill, Giovinazzo, Harper and Belknap round out the rest of the very good cast. Belknap, in my opinion, is the weakest link, but I don't dislike her, either.",2006

8,"I don't think I've ever been more shocked by how much I liked a film. I had very low expectations when I decided to watch ""The Village,"" because I knew how much critics had panned it. I'm not saying that I regard the consensus of the critics as sacrosanct. But the movies I love are rarely ones that have earned critical scorn, so by the law of probability I doubted that this one would be any good. Besides, I had noticed a steadily downward slope in the quality of M. Night Shyamalan's films since ""The Sixth Sense."" When ""The Village"" was released and subsequently panned, it seemed to fit the pattern that I myself had noticed. So I didn't go and see the film. Only recently did I take a look at it on cable, more out of curiosity than anything else.",2006
10,"M. Night Shyamalan definitely did himself a disservice in releasing ""The Sixth Sense"". Brilliant as the film was, its ""twist"" ending was so powerful that audiences the world over expected nothing less from the talented young director. And so, Shyamalan has been trying with every single outing since to recapture that sense of awe.",2004
10,"The Village is set in a small, rural community living in a kind of 19th Century self-supporting agrarianism. Woods surround the town, and the villagers maintain a strict perimeter, as there are creatures in the woods with whom they've reached a truce so long as the borders are not breached. Tension mounts as the creatures start breaking their normal pattern, and one of the villagers, Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix), seeks permission from the town elders to travel through the woods, to the towns and ""those we don't speak of"", so he can acquire medicine for his fellow villagers.",2005
10,"This movie absolutely blew my mind. I grew up in a small village in Central Illinois. My village is on the map solely because of the Amish community which has established itself in the rural area around the town. ""The Village"" is reminiscent of all things strived for by the Amish community. Whilst ridiculed by many and misunderstood by most of the rest, the Amish and the community in ""The Village"" long for the same things: a return to simpler times when the good in life was much more prolific. Although it could be argued that the members of the village have their ideals based upon and rooted in fear, that doesn't differ drastically from many ideals held throughout the world. The negative aspects of our ideals may not be as obvious and spelled-out to us like those of in ""The Village,"" but they remain similar none-the-less. ""The Village"" is a real thinker's movie and I commend M. Night Shyamalan for another remarkable movie. I can't wait to see what's next.",2005
10,"The film The Village, was quite unfortunately Mal advertised, this being in Greece of course. Instead of showing the ingenuity of the plot and the sort utopia created, it depicts a cheap horror story. This accomplished two very inopportune things. Firstly it attracted quite a unimaginative unintelligent crowd of people, who were, of course, displeased by the outcome of the story. Secondly it didn't allow the more imaginative more interpretive crowd to enjoy the quite complacent plot and Walden Two like utopia ultimately falling apart the sole reason people never left the place was due to their fear of some unknown creature.It was well done, had a good group of productive actors and a very suspenseful plot and deserves better reviews than it is given.",2005
9,"It is very sad to see such a beautiful movie being so underrated, I believe the problem with it is that it was promoted as a horror film, this was a huge mistake because it attracted the wrong audience. Horror film fans won't like this film that's for sure!",2012
5,"Yes, this film was marketed poorly. Yes, the trailers were misguided. But yes, this is also not a very good film.",2004
10,"I didn't really like Signs, but Shyamalan's later movie, The Village, was a great surprise for me. It's a really good mystery film, however, it was promoted as a horror movie and that might make people feel weird when they watch it. It was a terrible mistake, but if you decide to see the film without prejudices, you'll surely enjoy it.",2006
7,"I began watching ""The Village"" with reservations. I thought it would be a basic thriller. After viewing, I was pleased to find the questions it summoned...essentially, is the depiction of the Village a Dystopian or a Utopian society? Interesting elements are contained in the film that lead to an answer. First, what is the motive behind the attack of Noah Percey (the mentally challenged character) on Ivy Walker (the blind girl) in the woods? Was Noah's motive (a) to help Ivy navigate the woods, with his eyesight and experience? (b) to find his playmate and continue to play the games in which they often engaged? (c) or had his madness/jealousy escalated to the point that he was seeking her out to kill her, as he had attempted to kill Luscious, her fiancé? Furthermore, what was the purpose in his adorning the costume, was it (a) to escape the village people, as they were holding his captive for his attempted murder? (b) merely a costume for a game? (c) did he become a true creature of the woods? It is my opinion that the jealousy Noah experienced in hearing the news of Ivy and Luscious's engagement heightened his madness, causing him, first to attempt to kill Luscious, and then to similarly go after Ivy, with the intent also to murder her. Evethough the creatures in the woods were a fictional creation established by the elders to contain their society in the boundaries of the village, a real creature of the woods was created by Noah. Thus, their fictional creation morphed into a reality proving that the village, in fact, is a dystopia. The experiment made by the history professor was unsuccessful in that the society found they still can not escape the tragedy that befalls human beings. Jealousy, madness, and murder are not created by modern society but rather are inherent to the psyche of human beings. These human traits can not be stopped by isolation.",2005
10,"The Village is a clever and literate movie. I know it has received a number of negative reviews. However this is to be expected as Mr Shyamalan has had some popular success and is therefore fair game to ""critics"".",2005
1,"""The Village"" is just awful.  I feel like I was suckered into giving up $20 by Manoj Nelliyattu Shyamalan himself, and that he should personally apologize to my wife and I for tricking us into watching this awful film. Since that's not going to happen, first I will rant, and then go into some well-marked spoilers.",2004
2,"How does one write an intelligent, coherent review of a movie that made me feel like I was not only cheated, but done so at a shameless way? M. Night Shyamalan has, for the last three out of five movies, focused on making sci-fi/horror films that rely on only one thing: a fantastic twist at or near the movie's climax or critical point, which of course, would make you, the viewer, do a double-take and applaud him for doing something so breath-taking and original that it would, in itself, trump the big revelation in VERTIGO (1957) or the final big denouement scene in WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION (also 1957). With THE SIXTH SENSE (1999) he had a honest hit, a revelation of a movie director with talent to spare, but once he made SIGNS (2002), it was clear the cheap twist is all he is about.",2005
1,"NO spoilers don't worry; I won't ruin the precious (!) story I surely am going to be criticized for this again, but at least I hope to reach some people M. Night Shyamalan is nothing but a phony storyteller! At first I just thought he was over-hyped and untalented but the more films he delivers, the more it becomes clear that he's actually laughing with his fans and audiences for keeping up with his lame so-called ""mystery"" tales. It wasn't my intention to watch Shyamalan's latest so quick after its releaseIn fact, after struggling my way through that dreadfully irritating ""Signs"" I took an oath never to waste time or money anymore on his films. Luckily for me, a friend wasted his money on this because, I assure you, ""The Village"" is absolutely worthless humbug. Shyamalan once made a partly successful film called ""The Sixth Sense"" using some stylish elements. Since then, he shamelessly repeats this formula and all you'll ever find in his films are an exaggerated use of ominous music and silence, a very slow tempo and a cast that is overacting in the opposite way (meaning they do their best to look depressed, unworldly and silent). Would somebody please tell the director that atmospheric aspects like these only work when you've got a story to tell? The premise of a little village inhabited by social outcasts who're terrified of the creatures living in the nearby forests is dull, ultra-thin and definitely not suited for a compelling mystery tale. And then, of course, there's the famous ""twist-near-the-end"" which pretty much has become Shyamalan's trademark. Well, the ""twist"" is this film is so ridiculous, so predictable and so pathetic that the entire project instantly turns into a comedy! Actually, I wouldn't refer to it as a twist but as a confirmation that our precious director is completely uninspired and overrated. What amazes me the most is that so many respected actors are almost battling to become part of this fake hype. Surely Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt know better than to accept awful scripts like this? Hopefully naive fans won't start shouting that opponents of The Village didn't ""get it"" and that the film actually contains several brilliant metaphors and underlying messages The only underlying message featuring here is that M. Night Shyamalan's constantly growing star-status is one giant hoax.",2005
1,"The village was an so-so movie based on an interesting idea. All the actors were believable in their parts (save one), the scenery and cinematography was good, the set was rather neat, and the suspense and mystery was satisfying though not gut wrenching. So what's wrong with it? ",2005
1,"When i first looked at the trailer of this film, and from what i had heard, i was quite excited to view what looked like an exciting fantasy/monster style film. The other thing that enticed me was that Joaquin Phoenix was starring in the film. Okay, so the fist half an hour drew me into the film with promises of tension, suspense, fantasy and the craziness that i yearn for.",2006
6,"Shyamalan has enlisted an impressive cast in this film who all give fun performances. Unfortunately, like the plot itself, the great cast is ultimately left to dry. I'm beginning to wonder if Shyamalan makes the same film over and over again. The films always open with such promise, creepy, suspenseful. Like with his other films this one revolves around the ""suprise"" plot twist, but this time around it doesn't quite work. The ""surprise"" is pretty obvious and revealed much too early, pretty much killing the suspense. ",2004
10,"'The Village' is not the 'scary monster movie' some reviewers wanted it to be. It is a subtle mood-piece, a Hardyesque rustic love-tragedy, a heroic quest, and a fable exploring the use of fear and deceit as tools for social control and manipulation. The 'twists' are, more accurately, keys to the mysteries and apparent anomalies. What is truly disturbing is the conclusion: a chilling 'happy ending' which raises serious moral questions. ",2004

The acting had potential....just nothing to work with, and I mean NOTHING!!!!!! I felt gypped. I would have rather not seen and or heard the media hype because I felt in hindsight it was misleading. Shame on you guys....You got me , but I'm watching for your movies from now on. Did I mention how slow it was?

I cannot say that I liked Shrek2 more then the first, but the second one is very good too: New characters as the Fairy Godmother,Prince Charming,Puss In Boots and Fiona's parents are introduced to us, and a new reality comes, with Shrek and Fiona's relationship going to a deeper step,and new confusions because of their wedding.One of the good surprises, was that neither Shrek or Fiona changed to the human form;I was almost sure that they would,but I think that the movie would loose its magic. By the way: The voice of the new characters really rules! But Julie Andrews, John Cleese and Rupert Everett only could do a great job.:) I liked Antonio Bandeiras as Puss In Boots as well!

Naturally the anti-social Shrek wants nothing to do with the invitation, but gives in to Fiona and Donkey's insistence. Needless to say the King is quite upset to find his daughter an Ogre and married to Shrek. Add the dastardly vain Prince Charming, a not so good Fairy Godmother and the delightful new addition of Antonio Banderas as Puss In Boots, and you get a fun, but ultimately unneeded sequel that treads to closely to the first plot-wise.

Although these are very different movies, both spoof all previous movies of their type and are loaded with insider allusions (just look at the length of the IMDb trivia sections for each!). Both use latest technology to create a hyper-real quality which goes beyond their forerunners to create a feel that the viewer is seeing something that has not been seen before. But each also stays true to their genres' formula conventions of character and plot that, though seemingly worn out, we still love. As a result these movies are satisfying, meeting some deep rooted needs but in novel and refreshing ways.",2004

9,"So, remember how long SHREK was in theaters? Remember how many times you laughed? Well, SHREK 2 brings back all the excitement and laughter! Myers stars again as Shrek, Murphy as the hilarious Donkey, and Diaz as Fiona.",2004
10,"I thought this movie would be worse than the first Shrek but it actually turned out to be really good. This is a tale of love and comedy. Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy star in this sequel. John Cleese and Julie Andrews are the parents of princess Fiona in this movie and I have to say they play that part well. They are perfect for each other. If you see Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, and John Cleese were all raw comedians before and now they are in children movies and John Cleese works for the humor department on TBS. This movie is worth the money and worth your time if you are a Shrek fan or a Eddie Murphy fan this movie if for you.",2006
10,"As much as I enjoyed the first Shrek, I honestly almost died laughing and loving Shrek 2. The first Shrek was sweet and innocent, but the second took us to a different edge with terrific animation and just drop on the floor laughable jokes. Antonio Bandares as the cat was just such a great addition to the cast, he just killed me! I don't understand why Shrek 2 wasn't on the top 250, how could someone not enjoy this Shrek? ",2006
6,"Shrek 2 is a fun movie to watch for the whole family and it improves over the original. Shrek 2 continues the story with Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers) going with his new wife, Fiona (Cameron Diaz), to meet his in-laws, the King and Queen of the Kingdom of Far Far Away, which bears more than a resemblance to Beverly Hills. But are they ready for their new ogre son-in-law and their daughter's new look? The King (voiced by John Cleese) seems to have his own plans and he enlists the aid of the Fairy Godmother and Puss in Boots to get what he wants. They plot is good and the execution is pretty good considering that most animated sequels are pretty cheap. I thought the first Shrek was okay nothing special but this one was a lot more funnier. I think what makes this movie work better then the first is the additional characters. Puss In Boots voiced by Antonio Banderas is hilarious and I thought he was a good addition to the cast. Of course having Mike Myers as Shrek was funny too and Eddie Murphy is still to annoying and he was the only reason why I didn't give this movie a ten. Cameron Diaz is good too but I felt she didn't really do anything special. Rupert Everett, Julie Andrews, Jennifer Saunders and John Cleese are all great additions to the cast and make this movie charming. The movie is quick and short but is able to leave so many funny moments you wonder why other comedies don't try this hard. Shrek 2 is the best kids movie I have seen this year and proves that even with a simplistic plot you can still let adults enjoy it. The story, the characters, the direction and the dialog are all smart and funny. Rating 8/10 perfect movie except for Eddie Murphy and everyone should watch.",2004
3,"I am baffled. How can viewers say this is better than the original?! Its plot is thin, twists slow and few, characters hollow and underused... And most of the funnier moments come from the indispensable visual quoting of blockbusters (Alien, Lord of the Rings, etc., prompting a pathetic ""did you spot them all"" quest), in a poor display of cinema under-literacy. The only positive point is the technical improvement, but who cares about this? Shrek managed to be much, much funnier despite its matchstick people. The welcome infusion of new characters is a wasted effort, as none of them offer more than an inconsistent set of one-liners: the fairy godmother and Puss in boots are particularly disappointing, with only a couple of interesting scenes each, lost in a sea of contradicting and threadbare interaction. Key scenes are embarrassingly low on laughs (come on!, 5 minutes into the movie, the ""are we there yet?/no"" sequence felt like half an hour! I stopped laughing at such jokes when I was 3!). All in all, I'm very sorry to say that the few amusing moments are not worth the hour-and-a-half session. The original featured complex fun that made it very enjoyable for kids and grown-ups alike; I doubt children will even like this one (too slow, not exciting enough), and adults will hate it. I did. 3/10",2004
8,"It is never an easy task to follow up such a big hit as Shrek was, however Shrek 2 does a truly fantastic job and you would have a strong case to argue that it is even better than the original. Taking everything that was so enjoyable from the first film, it places it in a different situation and adds a new set of interesting characters to interact with. Whereas I felt that the original Shrek film was content with parodying fairy-tales and letting its characters craft the laughs, Shrek 2 ups the adventure and adds all different kinds of jokes in order to making everything seem bigger than before. This method can so easily fail, but I'm very pleased with how well it works here.",2015
1,"By now most people who were fans of the first film has seen part two so I won't bother to tell the storyline. Anyway. I rented the first tilm this weekend without a clue that the sequel was just showing up on the moviescreen around here and I thought the first ""Shrek"" was just great (just like It was the other times I've seen it). So when a friend told me today that he was going to the movies to see Shrek 2, I gladly decided to tag along.",2004
1,"The original Shrek is one of my favourite films and one which I have enjoyed many times with my family. This movie is banal and unoriginal. The premise is weak and does not provide sufficient scope for plot development. The characterisations have not developed, the cast appears to be cruising and using Jennifer Saunders was a big mistake which shows how poor British character acting is compared to American. The movie references which worked before are unsurprising, un-entertaining and VERY self-indulgent. In short, this movie appears to have been developed by a committee which sought to work within the requirements of the formula of the first movie as it saw it and in its lack of understanding, produced something totally lacking the magic of the fist movie. This is the old, old story of art vs. commerce and this film is a salutory example of what can go wrong. Don't bother.",2004

But now he is facing his biggest challenge yet  meeting Fiona's parents in the Land of Far, Far Away.

The beginning was a real hoot especially when Charming pulled off his helmet and revealed he was wearing a hair net! Then, when he pulled that off he threw his hair about in slow motion. Really top notch stuff.  ",2004
1,"Wow...this movie sucked horribly. I enjoyed the original Shrek and held a high opinion of this movie...I cannot believe the massive let down that I experienced with this. My wife and I saw this with my nieces and even they didn't think it was funny at all. The adult references (a plenty) were very tacky and not very effective at all. I'm glad I have the Unlimited Movie Pass at Blockbuster...otherwise I would have been upset at having paid three dollars for a crappy movie. I would classify this one in the ""horrible failures"" file, along with the entire Guyver series and any video game to film movie (including Resident Evil).

The freshness of the first film has gone, but that is not to say that this sequel is stale, far from it! It still has plenty of new gags and parody's, and it successfully plays on a few 'in jokes' from Shrek's first outing.",2005

6,"I did like Shark Tale, but there is a lot wrong with it. I did think the animation was very nicely done, and I liked the references to Jaws and Godfather. But I do think that Finding Nemo was much better than this. Shark Tale could have been a great film, had it not been devoid of humour and heart. My first problem with the film was Will Smith. He tries to be funny, but as the film progresses, he gets tiresome, and at times you feel like you want to reach into the screen and put a hand over his mouth. There were times when the script was funny, and there were some nice ideas, but the pace of the whole film was uneven. The characters could have been developed a lot more, particularly Lenny(a nice surprise from Jack Black), and whereas there were a number of nice visual jokes, there is some very over-familiar material in the script. Kids may find the sharks a bit frightening, and adults won't find much to enjoy, with the exception of the talented voice cast, such as Angelina Jolie, whose Lola(a very beautiful fish) was one of the better characters, Rennee Zellwegger, who deserved better than she was given and Robert DeNiro, whose shark was just a caricature of the Godfather. Though it is Martin Scorsesse who gives the most entertaining vocal contribution. And I did like the music score. All in all, it is nice to look at, but there are some parts of the film that aren't as interesting as intended. I did like the film, but I was kind of confused at who it was aimed at. 6/10 Bethany Cox.",2009

9,"I have to confess my shock at seeing the 5.9/10 average rating for this movie and overall mediocre reviews. This movie is great! And I'm not a kid, either...I'm 26 years old and thoroughly enjoyed this movie at the age of 25. The soundtrack is unbelievable and fits in seamlessly with the action and comedy of the movie. You really have to hear Mary J. Blige's rendition of Cheryl Lynn's classic disco anthem, ""Got to Be Real."" Anyway, besides the fantastic soundtrack, every character in this movie matches beautifully with his or her celebrity voice. I particularly enjoyed Will Smith's and Martin Scorcese's characters; brilliantly done. Really, if you're looking for a fun, enjoyable movie that you can laugh and even dance along to, this is the movie for you. Young and old alike should enjoy this. I've seen it 3 times, and always have a good time watching it. Watch it!",2005

4,"I can't explain why I didn't like Shark Tale too much. Visually there is a creative backdrop which is absolutely beautiful. I wonder if they just took pictures of New York, doused it underwater and worked around the scenery. Because with the exception of that imagery, Shark Tale has a very loud, very brash, in-your-face mentality that takes away from the movie. Other features like The Little Mermaid and Finding Nemo invite you to the paradise of being under the sea. Shark Tale throws you in the middle of the loudest club and tells you to get down on it. I don't buy it and with the exception of some visual gags, nobody else could neither. This is also another movie where Will Smith can get back into his Fresh Prince gear and get away with it and Jack Black could play a gender confused shark and be accepted for it as well. I wanted to enjoy the scenery and the sight of an underground New York. Shark Tale offered it but instead beat us silly with all the hoopla we see everyday on the television set. What a disappointment. Enjoy the humor and expect nothing more.",2004
4,"Had ""Shark Tale"" had even an iota of the wit and charm that seems to have little trouble finding its way into Pixar's creations, the movie might have been more enjoyable. At the least the filmmakers could have snuck in some funny social commentary through the veil of animation.",2004
8,"It could be just me but I thought that the humor in this movie was perfect. I laughed lot's of times throughout the movie and was very entertained by it. I however think that this movie will not be loved by young children, they simply will not be able to understand most of the jokes and the movie also lacks some 'likeable Disney type of characters' for them.",2005
9,"I just can't understand why ""Shark Tale"" is so underrated. I have watched this movie about 3 times and yet, I still can't get enough of it. The fact is that the characters were very entertaining, the animation was brilliant, and the story was great and was sending messages along with it, such as accept your destiny, be happy with who you are, accept others for who they are, and you don't have to live ""on top of the reef"" to be a ""somebody."" This movie also exposes us to the pop culture. What more does this movie need to to make it a good one? I mean this movie has it all: laughs and everything. Then why is it so underrated? I really don't know. I do know though, that ""Shark Tale"" is one of the best movie I have ever watched.",2005
8,"""Shark Tale"" is the latest animated feature from DreamWorks, the same studio that gave us ""Antz"" and ""Shrek."" This new story can be called a cross between ""Finding Nemo"" and ""The Godfather."" It's no ""Shrek,"" but it's still enjoyable. The voice talent was well cast, with Will Smith as Oscar, the ambitious ""small fish in a big pond"" who finds himself an instant celebrity; Jack Black as Lenny, a peaceful vegetarian shark; Robert DeNiro as Don Lino, Lenny's father, the head of a shark mob, etc. The animation looks good, and a lot of movie references are clever. Sometimes, though, the producers of the movie seem to be trying too hard. But even if it doesn't always hit the mark, ""Shark Tale"" is worth a look.",2004
7,"I have to admit going into this review that I didn't at all have the slightest hopes of liking ""Shark Tale."" From the previews last fall, it reminded me a little too much of Pixar's ""Finding Nemo."" Not so, as I would later find out. ""Shark Tale"" draws much of its inspirations, as noted by critic Roger Ebert, from ""Casablanca,"" ""Jaws,"" and ""The Godfather"" - all movies that are considered to be modern American classics.",2005
1,"SPOILERS Ever since the original ""Toy Story"" (1995), we've had some truly wonderful animations. With films like ""Shrek"" (2001) and ""Finding Nemo"" (2004), we've had some amazing stories for the whole family which are equally funny and impressively animated. By the law of averages therefore, it is perhaps not surprising we would end up with one or two truly woeful stories. That is what we have here with ""Shark Tale"". This is a film which is short on humour, devoid of originality and a mechanism for Will Smith's ego.",2005
3,"We had high hopes of this movie (My wife our four year old girl and I) but sadly it did not grip any of us. Technically brilliant animation but the leaden script badly let the movie down. The sharks had the best lines but one ""Jaws"" gag was enough. The likes of Toy Story or even Finding Nemo have much wittier scripts and more interesting stories. Even my daughter was bored during the middle reels when nothing much was happening. Somehow the fishes having humanesque faces was slightly disturbing and a little unpleasant. I longed for Dory or Nemo; not just because of how they looked but because of their comparative naivety. Still, I'm sure someone will now use the colour techniques developed for this film to make something better.",2004
1,"When I first saw the trailer for SHARK TALE, I thought it looked like a rip-off of FINDING NEMO that didn't look particularly humorous. However...

This new world would look something like the one in Shark Tale. They're fish, but they seem a lot more like people anyway (and most of the characters resemble the actors who provide their voices). It's the same principle as The Flintstones, really, except with a nautical theme instead of a prehistoric one; instead of seeing Ed Sullistone on TV, we see Katie Current. You get it.",2006
8,"with big and well-known names such as will smith, Robert De Nero, Renee zellwegger, Angelina Jolie, Ziggy Marley, and Katie couric involved in this animated film, i felt that this movie was going to at least come close to finding nemo, a masterpiece that is and always will be the leader of the ""under-the-sea"" type animation. shark tale was somewhat disappointing and i did not notice anything hilariously funny about it. in this film, a fish (voice of will smith that wants to make a name for himself in society believing that he is a loser.. coincidentally, while trying to escape a shark, he ends up ""killing"" it (it was really just an accident). however, the other fish believe that he actually killed the shark and he receives fame and glory as the ""shark slayer."" anxious for the chance to be somebody, this fish plays along and uses it to his advantage. the most ridiculous part is the fact that these sharks are actually afraid of this puny fish. however, this is nothing compared to will smith's role at the end of this moving in mending the relationship between a father shark and his son who chose a vegetarian lifestyle instead of being like the other sharks. the only ""funny"" parts in this movie involve the shrimp who appear a few times (at least in think they are shrimp). after seeing finding nemo, this movie was definitely a disappointment.",2006
7,"This movie was another on of those movies that at any age if you watch it you will ove it. It will definitely make you smile and have a good chuckle out if it. It was more enoyable for kids I admit, but it was just so amusing you gotta love it. The story plot is simply and fun and I guess does teach you a bit or two about moral friends and being honest and truthful.. But it was all fun and games. it was a cute movie that anyone will like. So go out there and watch it because it is worth it to watch it. Shark tale is better than Fidning Nemo, but both had there strengths and weakneses. Shark Tale is a great lesson for small kids and maybe even a few adults.",2006
7,The star power in this movie really made the difference...u can see really see Robert De Niro in the way the shark moves and talks. Martin Scorcese as Skyes is pretty cool...and Will Smith isn't too bad either. The only part that I would be critical about is that the story isn't very original.At times its even predictable. But all in all the movie is funny...Jack black as Lenny is great. Those who liked Finding Nemo would probably like this movie too..(Although it isn't as good as Finding Nemo) Worth a watch...for kids as well as for adults.Angelie Jolie was a great choice to play the part of Lola.The animation in this film is brilliant...buts thats something v have come to expect of animated films..isn't it!!,2005
4,"While Sharktale may appeal to an audience out there, it's hard to tell for which one. The film is not a failure, but thanks to the mega-hype by the Hollywood system, with marketing railing up the walls and the stars of the film (only recognizable by voice and oddly shaped animation on the faces) trumped to bring in the kids and adults, would have to do a lot to live up to it. As it is, the filmmakers bring in not just movie references to not only The Godfather but many other crime films and shows, but urban/hip-hop culture, and corporations like the Gap, Krispy Kreme, Burger King, etc. But the film is such in love with the in-jokes that it leaves the story and characters on the cloth-hanger. The jokes that do work are the ones that aren't as over-the-top as the others, or at least those that don't involve flatulence and over-emphasis on ""bling-bling"". ",2004

Every episode is very, very entertaining, funny and has an amazing story. Another thing I really like about the show is when Drake & Josh talk to the audience about each other before it starts because it builds up the funny mood. They both act really well, Drake's acting is definitely original and Josh's acting is quite similar to Jim Carry when he makes a lot of face expressions but it suits him and I really like both of them.",2007
10,"I couldn't recommend this show enough. If you want to watch TV that offers sheer, unadulterated enjoyment then you need to see this show. It's hilarious, feel-good and uplifting. Dan Schneider struck gold when he came up with idea of giving these two a show. Josh Peck and Drake Bell were originally on the nowhere near as funny Amanda show, and their characters in this are essentially exaggerated versions of themselves. Drake is a smooth talking, guitar playing ladies' man whereas Josh is the polar opposite. The chemistry between the two is amazing. The humour in the show walks the line between so bad it's good, and just plain good. There are many classic moments that I can't even begin to pick out individual ones. The only downside to the programme is that when I'm watching it's so amazing and so feel-good that when it's over I just want to die. Absolute perfection and those who say otherwise are pretty much plain wrong.",2005

10,"Drake and Josh is comedy gold and one of Nickelodeon's only worthwhile and home run hit shows. I didn't really get into it at first because it was on such an obscure network, known only for its mindless cartoon shows like Spongebob (which after a few episodes I deemed highly inappropriate for the two children I babysit regularly)and I am in my mid-twenties. But after channel surfing a number of times, the 7 year old girl I was watching yelled ""Stop! It's time for Drake and Josh!"", on Nickelodeon. I decided to at least try it, and if I didn't approve, I could always change it. Well, after watching a few minutes of it with her, we were both cracking up. The fun begins when two polar-opposite boys in high school, end up becoming stepbrothers, when Josh's dad marries Drake's mother and thus creates an Odd Couple situation. The show's characters, mainly energetic Josh's crazy mannerisms and cartoon-like behavior (without going overboard) highly appealed to 7 year old Melanie (who kept giggling about how funny he was) and even managed to reach me on a different level, even though they are young men in high school. Josh's step-brother Drake (who is not too bright and very girl crazy) often gets into many crazy adventures and situations, and his poor brother Josh gets dragged along for the ride. The antics and dialogue that goes on between the two boys (who also share a room...and a bratty little sister)is often reminiscent of old comedy and sitcom routines, but with a fresh new face. Now I am even drawn to actor Drake Bell's (Drake Parker on the show) music and his career (He plays the title theme song ""I Found A Way"" which is an addicting catchy tune) Through whatever challenges and silly problems these boys face, they always manage to come out on top because they have each other to lean on. Great show for everyone!",2007
1,"Sometimes, while I'm watching this show, I actually begin to wonder if this was sort of a ""how-not-to-make-a-sitcom"" show. Every tiny little aspect of the show is unoriginal, and the same jokes are used over and over throughout the show, such as Megan's pranks, Josh's ""speech impediment"" or whatever you want to call it, and the whole girl thing with Drake. What makes it even worse it the fact that not one of these repeated jokes are funny. In fact, if it weren't for the laugh track, most people wouldn't even know which parts are supposed to be funny.",2007

I mean, he yells so much, he does these stupid hand movements that are as annoying as anything. Drake is plain stupid, and Megan just doesn't know when to quit. The person thats aggravates me the most is, of course, Josh. He's just..UGH. I feel like I want to puke because he's so not funny, his jokes and repeating words have gotten old, and he just goes on and on about crap that nobody cares about. 1/10, thanks to Josh.

Before I watched Drake and Josh on Nickelodeon, I watched Rugrats, Rocket Power, Hey Arnold, and All Grown Up based on Rugrats. Its not like I don't watch it anymore, they're not on the air or they're on a different time. I miss watching all those shows on Nickelodeon so I choose to watch Drake and Josh.

1,"This show really proves that Nick has gone to hell. I mean seriously. I could not SEARCH for a show with worse comedy, characters, and writing. I would like to point out that this show teaches children ALL the wrong things. The jokes and the comedy are bad, but the characters are by far the worst this show has to offer. (Just a side note, Im not blaming the actors for this). First we have Drake. A selfish arsewhipe who plays about three chords on a guitar, always gets the girl, and treats his brother like crap. (The WORST thing about Drake is that they had the gall to stick him in a Black Sabbath shirt. As IF he ever listened to Sabbath...). Then we have the sister, Megan, who always gets away with doing horrible violent things to her brothers, and manages to convince her dumbass parents that she's innocent. Then we have Josh. Josh gets punished EVERY episode for doing the right thing it seems. The only DECENT, morally conscious character in this show gets dumped on every single damn episode. The jokes thatthis show contains are bland. I recall thinking that if the show had no laugh track, no one would know what to laugh at. Dan Schnider has really gotten lazy. Thanks a bunch Nick. Thanks for airing this unholy charade of comedy.",2007
10,"OK, so I might sound like a dork here, but I do have an excuse as to why I started watching this show. First let me say that I'm 18 years old, and I am in college. Now let me say that I absolutely LOVE this show. I started watching it because I babysit a 6 year old in the afternoons, and this show is on, and he watches it. But I've watched it enough with him that I watch it even when I'm not babysitting. Seriously, watch it. You'll love it. It's so funny, and Josh and Drake are so good together. It's completely cheesy, but it'll capture your attention, I guarantee it....(and that comes from someone who can't sit still long enough to watch 5 minutes of anything!)",2007

The idea to have two young boys as our main characters is an original idea - only one that's been used about fourteen billion times before. And the humour isn't - if you get my drift. The laughter track is probably made by an audience of 100 held at gunpoint and given cue cards to read - ""LAUGH, STAY SILENT, SHOW SIGN OF SHOCK, APPLAUD etc.), and this show just seems to think that simply saying and referring to ""root beer"" is enough to satisfy an audience. There's so much better stuff to be seen on TV - at least Spongebob Squarepants was inspired even if crap. Don't even think about watching this unless you're a 3-year-old idiot who eats his snot. 2/10",2007

It brings a modern view to its comedy, combined with a classic aspect ensued by the wonderful actors on the show.",2007

One day I was just sitting on my couch with my little brother and we were flipping through the channels. We got to Nick and we were expecting it to be SpongeBob but it was this new show we had never seen before... Drake and Josh. At first we thought it looked weird but then found out it was completely funny! Now we always watch it! The whole point of the show is that Drake and Josh are step brothers. They are always getting into arguments, needing help from each other, but it all gets back to the point they have not always been brothers and that it is good to have each other. They also have a little sister named Megan who is always playing jokes and pranks on them and always gets away with it! This show is known as a teen comedy. It is VERY funny! You must watch this show! I read in Nick magazine it is the second most watched teen show in the country! It's one less the American Idol. Thanks for listening!",2006
10,"It's been a while since I saw a film that depicted buddies on the down-and-out meeting (or running away from) their destinies that had performances so nuanced as this film. In an age when movies have to appeal to a young crowd who is not that attentive to detail and prefers its visuals fast, furious, and simple, SIDEWAYS slows down a couple of paces and, like the wine ubiquitously present throughout, allows its own story to breathe and take its lovely, wistful taste as we follow the two main characters played by Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church in their ""weekend of debauchery."" One couldn't imagine two more mismatched people -- Giamatti plays an intellectual introvert while Haden Church plays an irresponsible goon still trapped in high school -- but one senses that these have been friends for a long time, even if their friendship is held on a tenuous string. But friends they are, and it's described in this trip that begins in Southern California as they drive up the coast and enter wine country, where they meet two women, Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh, equally different, both a complement to the men and with whom the men pair up with. The fact that the Madsen/Giamatti pairing is tentative while the Oh/Haden Church pairing is essential to the back story of wine: where the latter display their affair ""all over the place, commonly"" like Cabernet, the former is defined closer to Pinot, and in one heartbreaking scene, both Giamatti and Madsen define their characters through the evolution of wine throughout the years.",2005
9,"What a refreshing adventure great writing really is. Through the mind, heart and soul of a filmmaker like Alexander Payne you can enter forbidden territory and dive into experiences that, at first glance, seem so far removed from our own. Little tales with enormous, universal implications. Paul Giamatti, Thomas Haden Church and Virginia Madsen jump out of the screen and as soon as the movie ends we find them sitting next to us. We get home and find them waiting for us there, we even find them on the mirror looking back at us. This is the sort of movie going experience that will never get old. Its strength is in its truth. You may not like it, you may even resent it. Good, that's what art is all about. It provokes you. It motivates and inspires you. And as if all that wasn't enough, it entertains you it amuses you, it gives you one hell of a great time. I want another Payne soon in a theater near me.",2005
10,"Sideways is a beautiful portrait of mid life disappointment. The backdrop is lovely California wine country, and the casting is flawless. Every single performance in this film is surprising, pitch perfect, and unusual. The movie has the remarkable ability to capture sadness and desperation in just the light that allows the audience to recognize the humor. The ending is satisfying but not too pat. In short, this is the best film of 2004.",2005
9,"I love movies like Sideways for many reasons. One may be that I will never see a commemorative Sideways bottle of wine or the Sideways happy meal at McDonald's. My point is that Sideways is a great movie and nothing more. It doesn't rely on blockbuster star power. It doesn't need flashy special effects or gimmicks. Paul Giammatti performs flawlessly as a flawed and deeply troubled character. I found myself forgetting he was acting. I only saw the character he was playing and became engrossed by his presence. Thomas Haden Church offers a very nice contrast by playing what appears to be a two-dimensional, sophomoric, womanizer. The story is simple and focuses more on character development. It is easy to connect with each of the main characters. They may not be likable but what they are is human. If you can't relate to them personally, they remind you of a family member or close friend. Overall, this film is for those who like movies based in reality, which as you will see can produce some of the most bizarre and comical situations of all. If you like movies with jokes you don't have to think about (Who doesn't from time to time) don't worry, this film has a surprisingly high amount of low brow, immature, vulgar humor, mixed with the dry and subtle. Give it a try. 9/10",2004
10,"This film has Oscar buzz all around it. It's a beautifully crafted, brightly written string of pearls. Its lead players, Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church, are both actors we remember seeing from time to time for at least the past fifteen years but whose names never before appeared on our radar screens. Here they both enter the arena of notable film actors and memorably so. The film is a comedy drama to a great extent (at least in my own mind) influenced in style by my late friend, John Cassavetes. Finely directed by Alexander Payne, its comedy issues from the breast of characterization and not contrived, pasted on sit-com lines. This alone is rare in film and denotes craft writing of the preeminent kind.",2004
9,"Greetings again from the darkness. Writer/Director Alexander Payne was the creative force behind one of my favorite films from the past couple of years with ""About Schmidt"". With ""Sideways"" he proves his insight into human nature was no fluke, but instead, an amazing gift. He captures many Hollywood stereotypes such as mid-life crisis, groom-to-be cold feet, post-divorce confidence crunch and the overall desire to be loved, or at least liked. What makes Payne's work so unique is his ability to deliver multiple messages, with brilliant comic twists, using little more than unlikeable lead characters and sizzling dialogue! Moral bankruptcy is at a peak in ""Sideways"" as one of our leads (the magnificent Paul Giamatti from ""American Splendor"" and ""Man on the Moon"") steals cash from his mother and the other (Thomas Haden Church from TV's ""Wings"") is on a mission to have his bachelor party last an entire week while claiming we just don't understand his plight. Also delivering a wonderful touch to the film is Sandra Oh (Diane Lane's pregnant buddy in ""Under the Tuscan Sun""). Oh has very unique looks and mannerisms, but is terrific as one of Church's conquests. The soul and spirit of this film belongs to the drastically underrated Virginia Madsen (if you have never seen ""The Hot Spot"", make it priority viewing). Madsen (sister to cult favorite Michael Madsen of ""Kill Bill"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"" fame) literally jumps off the screen with her eyes and smile. Her character wants so much for a better life, but is strong enough to avoid her past mistakes. She is the one we root for. This is an excellent film and nice character study with a snappy jazz score. Payne has proved he should be considered among the best filmmakers of today - now could someone please help his film obtain better distribution!!!",2004
10,"Alexander Payne is becoming a magnet for me. I wait for his films. He is an eminently American director that can look in with the incisive eye of an incisive foreigner. Besides all that, he is a poet. In ""Election"" he gives us an electro shock disguised as a Teen College Comedy. I laughed in horror at the cleverness of the storytelling. In ""About Schmid"" he forces us to look into one of the darkest corners of our society and find ourselves there. And he does it in the funniest most entertaining way. In ""Sideways"" he trusts his audience enough to put impossible hurdles for us to love his characters -- Paul Giamatti and his mother's money, for instance -- and yet, we have to admit he's made his point. We are all people. He manages to surprise us with our own capacity for compassion. Vittorio De Sica, Billy Wilder and Mario Monicelli come to mind. Yes Mr. Payne you are the ticket!",2005
8,"A woman's take on this is probably not the same as a man's. Initially I was put off by Charles Hayden's Church's character crudeness and Giamatti's character's repulsiveness but that changed was I was able to look below the surface. By the end of the movie, I felt very sorry for Church as he was not only dumb and shallow, he was actually so empty that whatever female was before him became a mirror of his need to connect with anything that felt like caring. Church did a fabulous job and was incredibly believable as a has-been wannabe, desperate to hold on to his dream of the kind of good life that is bought by charm and good looks. He is just on the edge or realizing his time is running out and that is a whole lot for this character to absorb as he has never given much to the concept of ""thought.""",2005
1,"I was shocked to see on the DVD case that 'Sideways' has won 3 major film awards and even has comments saying it is 'The funniest film of the year' and 'Unmissable'. For me, 'Sideways' was a struggle to watch and three quarters of the way through I gave up. (Apologizes to anyone who watched it all the way through, where it apparently picked up, according to my Dad) The 'funniest film of the year' certainly didn't live up to its praise, I hardly laughed at all and when there was any humour, it was hardly side-splitting. For example, Jack chases Miles down a steep hillside with amusing music in the background: award- winning comedy? The boring scenes where we a silent Jack and Miles driving through the vineyard-full countryside are completely pointless, even using split-screens doesn't liven boring snapshots of roadsides and wildlife. There didn't seem any attempt at making wine interesting to anyone who knew nothing about it, which was odd because it became the main feature of the film. Jokes about Pinot wines washed over me completely. Even though the acting seemed to be good, it still couldn't endear me to these two awful characters. Jack is foul-mouthed, arrogant and a cheat, whilst Miles is a slightly creepy, wine lover who spends his time writing rubbish and steals from his mother. If you do decide to watch this film, make sure you have a good book or your I-Pod with you.",2005
1,"The one great redeeming quality of this movie is its philosophical consistency. It's about a middle-aged man who has populated his life with pretensions - that he is a writer, an epicure, and an expert on wine. This movie will appeal exclusively to those with an all-too common and all-too-similar conceit: that they ""appreciate good movies."" Sideways is a brilliantly acted, brilliantly polished turd. The direction and editing is superb, the acting is magnificent and the characters have both depth and realism.",2005
10,"The bad reviews on this site for ""Sideways"" seem almost willingly obtuse. One has to wonder if they unwittingly see unpleasant aspects of their own lives and personalities in the people on-screen...? Film, after all, isn't just a window into other people's lives; it is also a fun house mirror where, like it or not, people just like you and me are tested in some way. Bear in mind George Abbott's basic model of drama:",2006
8,"Alexander Payne's ""Sideways"" is what is known in the movie business as a ""Little Movie That Could,"" a low budget, independent film without major stars or dazzling special effects that, nevertheless, achieves a measure of success at the box office and, in this case at least, an Oscar nomination for Best Picture of the year.",2005
1,I thought it was incredibly awful.,2004
3,"It is hard not to notice the similarities between the principals in this film and that of Swingers. However in Swingers the main characters, Mike and Trent, were a much more likable duo and far more interesting dimensionally. The character of Mike evolves from doubt and self loathing to becoming more confident and in the end forgets his former love and moves on.",2004
2,"First of, I'd like to start by saying that Sideways was one of the biggest disappointments that I've experienced in a very long time. I went into the movie theater with great expectations of a comedy that was funny and bittersweet at the same time (similar to Payne's previous film, ""About Schmidt""). I came out feeling that I had been cheated. There were so many things that I disliked about this film that I don't even know where to begin. First, neither of the two characters is remotely likable. I know that Payne was trying to show the desperate nature of Giamatti's character in the scene where he steals money from his mother. But in all honesty, can any normal self-respecting person relate to that??? I'm not trying to sound high and mighty, but I cannot think of ANY reason to steal from my mother, much less doing so in order to fund a wine-tasting trip with one of my friends. Likewise, am I honestly supposed to believe Church's character when he begins to cry about losing his wedding rings and in doing so possibly losing his fiancée? Am I supposed to overlook the fact that he had sex with two women 6 DAYS before his wedding? Give me a break. Throughout the movie I did not feel that any of the characters were real, but that scene was the most ridiculous. The second thing that disappointed me was the fact that the movie was not funny. Before I go any further I should say that I enjoy dry and subtle humor (""Being John Malcovich"", ""Curb Your Enthusiasm""). That being said, I found absolutely nothing funny in this movie. There were a few moments that deserved a small chuckle, but that's about it. Perhaps I would've enjoyed the movie more if I was a wine connoisseur, which I must admit I'm not. As a matter of fact, the wine is the best and most likable character in the movie (aside from Virginia Madsen, who was very good). On that same note, one of the only redeemable factors of this movie was the cinematography and views of the California wine country which were beautiful. Also, although I did not like or feel any sympathy towards Giammatti's character, I have to admit that he's a good actor and delivered a solid performance. My overall description of this film is that it's a mediocre buddy pic that does not deserve any real acclaim. If, however, anyone who has not yet seen it decides to do so I have this advice...Do not believe all the hype surrounding this movie and do not expect a funny comedy. You will be disappointed. I know I was.",2005
1,"""Sideways"" simply angered me. I have seen a lot of garbage films over the years but none has made me want my money - or time- back more than this film, and I only paid $1 to rent it. How this movie achieved such popularity is almost beyond me. It is the type of mass-produced, ""been there, seen that"" type of garbage that one expects from Hollywood... making it a horrible disgrace to independent cinema. There was a line in the movie that goes something like ""book publishers don't care about the quality of the story, the only want marketing value nowadays"". Now that's ironic. That line describes perfectly what is wrong with this film - it's got no content, but boy did the press make you want to see it.",2005

1,"This jaw-droppingly overrated film had me squirming in my seat, bored to the point of physical pain, right from the onset of the smoooooth jazz soundtrack and split-screen montage. Next comes the dislikeable, obnoxious, stupid and thoroughly boring characters, sets them up in a totally unlikely relationship and a clichéd situation and then....just goes on and on. It was like being stuck in a lift with a bunch of stamp collectors. Nothing rang true, nothing convinced, right down to the (admittedly excellent) Virginia Madsen character, a geek's fantasy if there ever was one (like comic book obsessives who dream of discussing the merits of the Green Lantern with Scarlett Johanssen).",2005

Where are all the plainly dressed, overweight, average-looking, or senior citizen lesbians in this series? I mean c'mon! I realize that there are plenty of feminine, lip-stick lesbian sisters out there. And, I say that they should fully exercise their right to dress and act however they wish. But, the L Word is SATURATED with mainly high-femme lesbians with long, dark hair, and stunning out-fits. I know that they have Shane in this show, but she seems to be just a token butch.

Didn't miss one second of Boston Legal so I guess that tells you that I liked it a lot. Of course the ""Shat Man"" drew me in but the overall show got me hooked. Well worth the late hour on Sundays. Rene Auberjonois ( of DS 9 fame) was an added surprise.",2004

Shaw constantly showcasing the inward wrestling of his wit, his honour, his job and his desire for (all) women. Whomever he clashes with tends of come away shocked, appalled or at the very least, stunned. Shirley Smitt (Candice Bergman) dislikes him initially but out of respect for his skills as a lawyer begins to warm in his direction. She presents the stern serious side to the law firm and is predominately concerned with its reputation, but having previously slept with Denney (Shatner) there is room aplenty for hilarity. A special mention should be given to Tara Williams (Rhona Mitra) who smoulders deliciously whenever the camera draws near. Do yourself a favour - watch this top series!

10,"Boston Legal is my dream come true - Comedy / Crime /Legal Courtroom Drama which is a perfect combination of all genres and is as funny as it is clever and gripping. The idea of ""Boston Legal"" had came to its creator, David E. Kelley during the last season of once very popular but sadly quietly dying legal drama ""Practice"". I was a big fan of the show and I stayed with it to the end. Bringing to ""Young, Berluti, & Frutt"" of ""Practice"" an ethically-challenged, arrogant, morally ambiguous but brilliant and somehow likable attorney Alan Shore (James Spader) was Kelley's great idea. The last season of Practice became one of best thanks to Spader who resurrected it by simply being there. When I heard that Spader would have a spin-off ""Boston Legal"", I could hardly wait for it and it has never disappointed me. Boston Legal is ""Crane, Poole, and Schmidt"", a famous and wealthy firm that specializes on civil cases. In the center of the show are Alan Shore and his older friend and mentor Denny Crane (William Shattner). To bring them together in one show and let them have a wonderful relationship that is based on their differences (comparing to Denny who is in love with the sound of his own name, Alan seems highly moral and stable model citizen) and is at the same time hilarious, sincere, and moving was a pure genius. Each episode would end with both Alan and Denny sitting on the balcony, smoking cigars, drinking scotch and having a friendly conversation and those are the best moments of the show.",2007

Funny thing, I was done with the last line, but if seems there is a minimum posting length of 10 lines. So I think I will tell you of another of this series strengths, that clearly the makers of the 10 line rule are choosing to forgo. Succinctness.

I miss seeing the original characters from the first season but the new cast is growing on me, especially the newly developing relationship with Brad who is the most beautiful man I've ever seen. The show is always bringing up political topics about everything that I care about like the environment, prejudice, and world peace.

It's full of humor ranging from intelligent to low-brow. Some cases are so ludicrous you can't help but watch. Others are relevant to the big issues of today and are quite compelling. The hilarious and surprisingly dynamic cast, and the riveting performances are really what makes this show worth watching.

I like watching guest stars like the great Shelley Long who should win an Emmy for her guest appearance as a nymphomaniac divorcée.

This is an action movie rather than horror.  The outdoor scenes are filmed with a grainy, hand-held camera which gave the audience the feeling of being disoriented much the same way the characters would have felt.  The movie was not made in the MTV-generation style that the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake was.  Dawn of the Dead stuck to the same mythology of the first without giving it a complete reimagining.

Unlike others, I don't think this movie should compare to Resident Evil because zombies here don't act like those ones, oh no, not at all. You surely will need to see the movie to understand, but I was simply delighted. Most important, this movie contains no pseudo-scientific bullsh!t regarding how do the zombies appear, skips through unnecessary preparation, the soundtrack is absolutely beautiful and the end, oh, the end is... what can I say? Great-great-great! Overall, I very much enjoyed seeing this and I guess it's a movie you can see more than once.

And when I heard of a remake of Dawn of Dead with Romero having a hand in it, I was excited. Finally a decent budget and modern day effects along with Romero's touch. Unfortinately I felt betrayed and very unsatisfied after the first 10 minutes of the movie. And sadly the rest of the movie followed suit. The only good thing if any in this film was thankfully the gore wasn't restrained, But that's the only decent thing about this film.",2005

1,"George Romero's original ""Dawn of the Dead"" is a classic, hands down. It is a fine, thoughtful movie. The characters are carefully meshed out and developed over the course of the narrative, beyond that, Romero's dramatic decisions make sense, he only uses four main characters to propel his story. The remake, on the other hand (one can only hope that Romero made some money from this, which would be the only justification), is a stock 00s Hollywood product: utterly soulless and moronic from the first frame to the last. The characters are stereotypes and at times bizarre (armed security guards in a mall?), the action perfunctory and essentially pornographic in its lack of relation to the story itself. The screenwriter decides to toss in some smarmy, obnoxious characters straight out of a bad 1980s teen sex romp. Annoying, smart ass yuppie? Check. Hard ass rent a cop security guards/morons? Check. Useless characters who stand around for ten minutes acting surprised that the zombies that have been attacking them for the last few days are, in fact, attacking once again? Check. Characters are uniformly good shots (none of the tension in the first film from SWAT members vs. the macho but inexperienced helicopter pilot) able to adjust their aim and ""shoot 'em in the head"". In the first film the characters planned and executed schemes to the best of their abilities, in this one a bunch of idiots run around like headless chickens flailing about wildly from one ill conceived plan to another. Thank you again, Hollywood, for doing your part to spoil a movie for young movie goers who will now make no attempt to see the original, since this remake is so ""totally awesome 'cause like a zombie like gets totally stabbed in the head"". Its as if serious film goers have committed some grievous collective sin and are all being punished in some massive, communal private hell. At least Ken Foree, Scott Reiniger and Tom Savini made a few bucks appearing in it.",2005

10,"I've been hearing lots of negativity about this movie. I think a lot of people have been shocked, frankly, by the raw and rough nature of the film. Having read the play, I've been looking forward to it for about a year now, and it's honestly one of the best plays I've ever read. Mike Nichols presents it in an amazing way, very faithful to the words as they're written (and they should be, for the movie is also written by the man who wrote the play, the brilliant Patrick Marber). ",2004
8,"Mike Nichols directed, in my opinion, one of the three best adaptations from stage to screen. ""Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf"" (The other two being Sidney Lumet's ""Long day's journey into night"" and Elia Kazan's ""A Streetcar named Desire) After the extraordinary television adaptation of ""Angels in America"" I also would have pleaded with Mike Nichols to do ""Closer"" Sorry I'm rambling. What I'm trying to say in a rather convoluted way is, simply, thank you Mr. Nichols. Adult themes, conceived and performed by adult artists. I hope it makes zillions of dollars so we can have more of it. Jude Law is a Peter O'Toole without the steroids, Julia Roberts a Jeanne Moreau with an American passport, Clive Owen is a child of John Garfield and Peter Finch and Natalie Portman a Jean Peters with a college degree. I saw the film twice in a row, I hadn't done that in years. Not since ""Drugstore Cowboy"", ""Apartment Zero"" and ""Sex Lies and Videotape"" The unfolding of the dark happens in front of our eyes and it feels chillingly familiar. Lies we tell each other with so much conviction with so much honesty. The only real thing is the pain and the loneliness. It doesn't sound like a very entertaining night out but believe me, it is. Go, see for yourself. You may have to confront something you didn't want to confront. That's part of the process call growing up. Who's afraid of that?",2004
8,"What a treat. Most of the people who came with me, left, half way through the film. I stayed to the end and I loved it. It moved me. A rarity this days. The face of Jude Law is, still, so full of possibilities. He seems unafraid of darkness. Strong. This is his most grown up performance. I can't wait to see what he'll become. (If he stays away from Hollywood as much as temptations permit, and keeps that purity, that makes his darkness so powerful, as intact as humanly possible). Julia Roberts is wonderful in a performance part Margaret Sullavan, part Jeanne Moreau but all her own. Clive Owen is a force of nature. Dangerous, compelling, human to the hilt. And what about Natalie Portman? Wow. No surprise here. But what a surprise. I'm sure she is going to amaze us for years and years to come. I'm really glad I stayed to the end.",2004
10,"This is the most honest film I've ever seen. Although I'm sure there are critics out there who will comment on the explicit language rather than the story, anyone who's ever been in a dysfunctional relationship can relate to at least some part of this film. I for one found it a very personal and shockingly accurate depiction of how human beings use love and sex to unintentionally destroy each other. The performances were magnificent from all angles. Mike Nichols has done it again. This film is ""Carnal Knowledge"" for the new millennium. If the Academy does not recognize ""Closer"" as a Best Picture candidate, then the Academy should no longer be recognized as the authority on achievement in film... yes, it's that good.",2004
9,"It's once in a very rare time that I go to the movies and I'm treated as an adult. I see a film that is intelligent, thought provoking, provocative and rawly realistic. Closer is that film. It present an honest portrayal of four severely unlikable characters and they screw with each others love lives back and forth. The film is told in adult sporting complexity through the growing plot points , the way it's filled and it's tasty advancing dialogue. Everyone in the film turns in a powerhouse performance worthy of Oscar consideration. Ms. Portman is wonderful as Alice shedding her blockbuster star wars acting skills and portraying someone multi dimensional with heart and pizazz. Julia Roberts stars as Anna in a cold, subtle performance which will leave audiences appreciating her acting believability as she pounces through each of her scenes with charismatic force. Jude law and Clive Owen are the real surprises here both turning in wonderfully appealing performance. Strong, weak, flawed and memorable. Especially whose last outing was the entertaining but mediocre action summer pic King Arthur. The film has wonderfully tight direction and sports beautifully placid colors and a fine adult score. The film draws dangerously close to being a near perfect film. I only wish it could've gone on for abit longer I wasn't completely satisfied to the ends of the characters on which we were give. but life itself isn't perfect or satisfying and this is a slick of someones life. Rush out and go see Closer! Oner of the best film's of the year!",2004
8,"Have you ever seen a human heart? It looks like a fist wrapped in blood.... Only in the film Closer can the universal symbol for love and devotion be brutally manipulated into a tool, one whose sole purpose is to express men's vile and barbaric proclivities. But this isn't your ordinary love story, in fact when viewing Mike Nichols newest drama, you can throw everything you thought you knew about modern relationships out the window. In Closer, your best bet is to expect the unexpected.",2004
10,"Anyone who says closer was crap obviously didn't understand it and should probably look in to watching less challenging movies. I've seen it at least 5 times and every time I find i like it more for different reasons. The conversations are so rich, fast-paced and intense, i think that's probably why i've heard so many complaints, i guess those kinds of people aren't used to having to think in movies. I mean come on am I the only one who read into it? The whole movie was so brutally honest in the way it spoke about sex and lies, love and compromise. It brought everything to the surface, like how we all live with this naive idea that honesty brings people together but in reality it does the opposite. The only couple to stay together did so on a basis of lies, compromise and denial. and most importantly the thing that had never even crossed my mind before closer, the notion of love at first sight. I think most people believe in it yet don't admit it, but anyway what most people don't realize is, that even when you find it, you never stop looking, waiting for it to happen again. Cause that's all it is, an instant connection with a perfect stranger, love of what we don't fully understand. but of course that dissolves, reality sets in and what you know you don't really like in that person. Truth is a bitch. We're only truly close when we're strangers i say. By far one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life. The only thing I'm upset about is Clive not winning supporting",2005
10,"The strength of Closer, both as a play and a motion picture, is the flawless, mature and beautifully crafted dialogue. Patrick Marber's screenplay is a testament to his truly great writing ability, as not much of the original text needed to be adapted in order to work appropriately and effectively on screen.",2004

As one friend said afterward, ""I'm in the mood for something relatively painless--like a full-body chemical peel.""",2004

Please, if you value life and the short time you have on this earth, go and take your gran out and feed some birds or something rather than sit in a darkened room watching this utter drivel. If you watch this film and actually believe it has something meaningful to say about the relationship between men and woman then, please, end yourself now, there is no hope for you. The script had to be written by an adolescently who has just discovered his body and thinks that being ""adult"" is talking about sex pretty much all the time...boring! Four unrealistic characters, with unrealistic motivational traits and unrealistic dialogue. Only people who like being told what it's cool to like will like this. Everyone else with their own mind will see this for what it is, a student film! Terrible!",2005

2,"Unnecessarily tangled romantic relationships among four beautiful people in modern London form the core of this Mike Nichols directed film, based on a play. About the only thing I liked here was the melancholy song ""The Blower's Daughter"", sung by Damien Rice, that opens the film. The film's script is wretched.",2009
4,"There is much hype to be found surrounding Mike Nichol's 'Closer', celebrated for its frankness and ""Oscar-worthy"" performances. I despised this movie however. Not that it is particularly badly written, acted or directed, but I found 'Closer' to be inane, inept, and totally unlikable with no apparent reason for existing other than to highlight the worst aspects of humanity. The movie is plodding and its cynicism about relationships and life in general is far too overblown. Infidelity and repeated sexual liaisons interchange between the same four characters for the entire length of the movie. Are we supposed to care about these people or their relationships? Are we supposed to care how cruelly they treat each other? It certainly doesn't appear that way, the film seems to want us to be distant from these characters, but for what reason? It's utterly pointless, banal, and the characters are just shallow, especially Clive Owen's Larry, whom I found to be completely repulsive. I am comfortable with explorations of sex in film, but here it is just tiresome; ""controversial"" and ""sexually honest"" material is substituted for any real, or at least interesting, character development. If this had been successfully achieved, we could connect with these people on some level, any level. Does the film wish us to applaud its excessive use of sexual expletives as bold; daring? It is frank, provocative, and often interestingly in-you-face honest, but as the film drags this approach just becomes grating and unrelenting. Add to this, the movie jumps ahead months and years at a time, which furthers our detachment from ever fully accessing these characters, ever fully understanding these characters, as if we are only offered the worst moments of the last four years of their lives - this continual distancing is distressing. This movie just rubbed me the wrong way.",2005
1,"I won't reveal what ultimately happens in Closer but I will confess that I was disappointed that it didn't end with a fiery double-decker bus crash that left no survivors. This film would have been stale 20 years ago, but it's completely ridiculous now. The ""truths"" about relationships that the movie attempts to reveal are just nuggets of stereotypical nonsense that you could see in a TV movie(Men thrive on conquest and dominance, Women can't resist being treated like whores, etc.). The film, like it's characters is shallow and dishonest underneath the pretty exterior.",2004
1,"This movie lacked a lot of elements, but above all it was unrealistic and shallow. I feel like I wasted the last 2 hours of my life, hoping there would be some climax or maybe just a linear plot. And don't try to tell me about symbolism... if this is how adult love really is, I have very dire expectations for the future of humanity. It seemed that the screenwriter had some wonderful ideas for argument scenes and exchanges of dialogue, and just filled in the rest of the story. What an absolute bore and complete disappointment. And just so you know, Natalie Portman was the worst cast choice for this role. Not even the bare breasts could keep my husband awake.",2005
1,Take four unsympathetic characters and slam them into one other in a series of contrived meetings. Then hop forward a few months at a time to some equally contrived decision points in their relationships. And at each stage make sure that they make absolutely the most unconvincing and ludicrous decision possible.,2005

The truth is, as everyone knows, that the film is simply dire. It is successful, because it is mandatory to claim to enjoy films like this, even though they are devoid of any single meritorious feature.The cast can't act, (particularly Jude Law playing his usual smug role), and the story has no touch with reality at all. The dialogue is laughable, and pretentious. Closer is invalid and should not even exist.",2005
10,"I teach a college course on WWII, in graduate school studied under several experts on the subject and have interviewed numerous survivors on both sides. This film comes out on top, perhaps the finest ever made on the subject of the war (though the Belorussian ""Come and See"" & ""Schindler's List"" are darn close as well).",2005
10,"This film definitely is a must-see because of the incomparable degree of realism displayed in it. Direction, camera and acting are of an unparalleled level and make you, as the viewer, feel as if you are actually in Berlin, 1945, and in the FÃ¼hrer's bunker. The film does not provide any commentary or judgment, it just shows facts.",2004
9,Der Untergang makes you live the horrors and craziness of war. Bruno Ganz's interpretation of Adolf Hitler is worthy of an Oscar. He is completely believable. Also the rest of the cast performs admirably. You feel transported to Berlin as it was bombarded by the Russians. You get a very clear insight (or an impression?) in how the military decisions were taken during those final days of the war. The movie balances well between large-scale effects of bombs exploding in ruined streets and depictions of different persons going though the experience  from Hitler and his staff in the well-protected bunkers to the principal military commanders torn between reason and loyalty and German civilians trapped in an inferno. The movie is neither pro-Nazi nor does it depict all Nazis as mindless monsters. It gives an impression of utter realism. Go see it in a good cinema  your seat will tremble as the bombs explode. A nine out of ten.,2004
10,"In recent years, war films have given a new exposure to the sheer nature of war. In ""Saving Private Ryan,"" ""Black Hawk Down"" and ""Born on the Fourth of July,"" we were exposed to the realities that a soldier endures not only on the battlefield, but what they take with them long after the battles end. However, ""Downfall,"" a German film nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 2005 Oscars, brings a unique perspective to the table. It is about the last days of Hitler and the Third Reich and the ultimate demise of both. More so than a war movie, this feature exposes the insanity of Hitler and the blind faith of his followers at the end. It is a deeply disturbing, intimate portrait of the cruelty that he inflicted not only upon 6 million Jews, but ultimately on his own countryman at the end.",2005
10,"""Der Untergang"" is certainly the most impressive, depressive and realistic dramatic movie about the World War II ever made. I have never seen a film picturing the insanity of Hitler in his very last days in a bunker in Berlin with his high command, and how the German people were hypnotized by him like in this film. Last year, I saw the deceptive, boring, pretentious and overrated ""Molokh"", showing a caricature of Hitler and Eva Braun in Bavaria. But ""Der Untergang"" is awesome and comparable to ""Apocalypse Now!"", my favorite movie of war.",2006
10,"This magnificent film goes where no one else dared to go to show us the last days of Adolf Hitler. The director, Oliver Hirshbiegel, working with a big cast, brings to life the madness of the last days of the monster, as observed by a young and impressionable secretary who witnessed most of the crisis.",2005
10,I don't know what to say about this film. I am almost speechless.,2005
10,"All I can say about ""Der Untergang"" is: WOW! This is one of those rare films that prove that the darkest pages in our world history easily surpass the fiction tales of the most imaginative fantasist. This soon-to-be landmark in cinema portrays the final ten days of Hitler's reign at the well hidden bunker in Berlin. In the opening sequences, we see how the Führer hires Traudl Junge (flawless performance by Alexandra Maria Lara) as his personal secretary and we largely witness the rest of the story from her viewpoint. Recent documentary footage with the real Junge is showed to audience at the end of the movie, stressing even more that this is a very intelligent and carefully elaborated production. A form of criticism I often encountered stated that Hitler was portrayed too ""human"" by the Swiss actor Bruno Ganz. Let me tell you that people who claim this haven't got the slightest clue what they're talking about! It's true that Hitler sometimes strokes his dogor even gives a compliment to his servant for cooking him such a lovely dinner! But only moments after, you're exposed to the real Hitler again! Alternately a mad-raving dictator, a disillusioned conqueror or simply a pathetic old man. But perhaps the most astonishing scenes in ""Der Untergang"" are the ones in which the persons close to Hitler  either professional or amicable  remain unconditionally loyal to him! It is deeply disturbing to behold how so many people blindly swear by the unworldly beliefs of a madman, even prepared to follow him into death. This accurate portrait results in a series of brilliant sequences with the severely shocking fate of the Goebbels family as an absolute highlight.",2005
10,I have been fascinated not only by the movie (I have watched this now 10 times) but the divergence of opinion - with some Germans saying it was terrible. This I don't understand. ,2005
10,"Considering the fact how hard it is to make an adequate movie about the  Third Rich and especially Hitler himself, ""Der Untergang"" is a superb  portrayal of the last days of Hitler, his minions and the Third Rich.  First of all, Bruno Ganz' performance is magnificent, brilliant,  perfect. You're beginning to think he IS the Fuehrer, his look, his  mannerism, his sick philosophy of life and his downfall are absolutely convincing. After seeing him you can finally understand why  so many people back then were attracted by his charisma, but thanks to  Ganz' performance you do not forget about the terrible crimes he  committed by his followers and about the evil inside the sick soul of  this man. His minions weren't that important in this movie, except for  Joseph Goebbels and his family. Heinrich Himmler, the ReichsfuehrerSS,  was portrayed as the man he was: an idiotic coward, who was in great  part responsible for the Holocaust and still believed in a peace  agreement with the allied forces, although this idea was completely out  of place. Albert Speer as one of the less criminal national socialists  was also quite good interpreted. Martin Bormann, Alfred Jodl and  Wilhelm Keitel, 3 other important Nazis, got too few screen time, and  Hermann Goering didn't even show up, he was just mentioned. I think  Goebbels wasn't portrayed that authentic as he could have, due to the  fact he was the most intelligent of Hitler's inner circle, but in some  scenes he seemed like someone who could just repeat his own slogans.  The part about Traudl Junge and the boy from the Volkssturm, Peter, was  also quite good, but it was clearly overshadowed by the Hitler/ minion  part. There are also some surprisingly well done battle- sequences  taking place in Berlin, in which you can also see a part of the pretty  high amount of blood and violence, for example when a soldier gets shot  through his head, some officers are committing suicide or the killing  of the Goebbels children, a scene which gave me the chills. Due to it's  high authenticity, great actors and an important message, this movie  could become as important as Schindler's List already is, in order to  show today's youth the insanity of Hitler and the whole Third Rich and  to make them avoid racist and extreme right wing organisations. All in  all, this is one of the best German flicks I've ever seen - although  there isn't such a huge number of good German movies. 10/10",2004
8,"Truly great movies are few and far between these days; but Der Untergang most definitely represents one of those rare occasions. Oliver Hirschbiegel, who brought us the wonderful 'Das Experiment' has produced a film that is very nearly perfect. Depicting the final ten days of Hitler and the National Socialist regime, Der Untergang or 'The Downfall' to give it it's English title is an expose of failure and the way that a madman can bend a whole nation into doing his bidding. The film is very realistic, and an excellent ensemble cast breathe life and believability into the roles of the various members of the Nazi party and because every performance is picture perfect, the whole thing comes together brilliantly as one whole piece. Bruno Ganz gives the central performance as the Fuhrer himself and it is one of the greatest performances I've ever seen in a film. His portrayal of Hitler in the middle of his downfall is absolutely perfect, and Ganz excellently portrays the man's every emotion. It must be difficult to play such a notorious character as Hitler himself, but Ganz rises to the occasion and gives it his all.",2005
10,"""Der Untergang"" (""The Downfall"") portrays life inside (and to an extent outside) the ""Führerbunker"" in Berlin during the last few weeks prior to Hitler's suicide in April, 1945. The screenplay was written by Bernd Eichinger, who has had previous experience with the adaptation of historical material for cinema, and done a commendable job in the process. I am, of course, referring to his screen version of Umberto Ecco's historical novel ""The Name of the Rose (1986). Some of Eichinger's other credits include ""Body of Evidence"" (1993, which he co-produced) and ""The NeverEnding Story"" (1984, as producer).",2005
9,"Few films have dared to touch WWII objectively from a German point of view; most use the Germans as great villains and Allied forces as great heroes... Movies like ""Patton"" show brief sights into German military thinking while ""The Pianist"" finds a good cultured German officer in a nightmare scenario ",2006
9,"Who better to make a WWII film than the Germans themselves? This is possibly the best WWII film I have seen yet. It is a very intense movie about the final days of Adolf Hitler (a SUPERB roll played by Bruno Ganz, he should get at least one Oscar for this...) which had me coming back to see the movie a second and even a third time (I saw T3 only twice, he he). And not only Bruno Ganz has done a great performance, the entire cast gives it all their best. Very good film indeed.",2004
7,The first 15 minutes made me doubt the qualities of this movie. The situations were a bit forced and the cuts were strange. But after the uncomfortable beginning the movie took momentum and kept it until the end.,2004
10,"You couldn't really expect to make a 'typical' movie out of the story of last days of the archetypal fascist dictator. 'Untergang' seeks to illustrate the situation of 'sane' people under the control of a madman; that and the impending arrival of the Red Army is the only dramatic jeopardy available - no romantic interlude, nothing to achieve, no sentimental buddy rescue shtick. We witness the reactions of people like you and me (and don't be silly enough to imagine I include Goebbels, etc. - I mean people doing their jobs under impending calamity) who happened to be in the wrongest place at the wrongest time. If this dilemma doesn't absorb you, it's a fault of your imagination, not of the utterly brilliant recreation of something very few people survived to bear witness to. 'Untergang' doesn't seek to make a judgment of Hitler because it doesn't need to: all you need to appreciate is his increasing detachment from reality and the way that this divides the people stuck with him. If there's any sort of judgment, it's of the herd mentality of people as a whole. The film becomes a series of stunning docu-vignettes of the various levels of humanity involved, each one posing the question 'What would YOU have done?'. This film is thought-provoking, and that naturally makes many denizens of the internet uncomfortable.",2008
8,"I tuned in late to this film, not expected very much, because we have all I suppose seen so many documentaries of Hitler's last days in the bunker, and a reconstruction with Alec Guiness thrown in for good measure. Many of these presentations depend on interviews with Trudl Junge, Hitler's secretary at the time. Her descriptions of the goings on during the final days are cool, precise, and dispassionate.

10,"A lot of war movies have a sense of patriotism or commercialism, but Der Untergang feels like it is just giving you the cold hard facts of the last ten days of the Third Reich. I have to commend the filmmakers for not using black and white or filtering the color, like many other WW II movies today. It is becoming a cliché. The film is based on Traudl Junge's recollections of the last ten days she spent in Hitler's Bunker. It takes place entirely in the Bunker, which gives the film a very claustrophobic feel. As the outcome of the war becomes clearer, the Bunker becomes a cesspool of drunkenness, denial, and even death.",2009

Name me a more or less realistic war movie and I've probably seen it, so when ""Der Untergang"" was first released in Germany, I already knew I wanted to watch it as soon as it would be released over here. The commotion that it caused, the good critics that it got, all made me look forward to the day that I would see it, but really nothing could prepare me for what I saw... It was amazing, it was great, it was jaw-dropping...",2005

10,"Seriously, I wasn't expecting much, but this was one of the best movies period. The actors and acting was terrific, the sets were incredible (St. Petersburg, Russia), the emotions... I felt like I was in Berlin during the last few days, I felt like I was in the bunker with Hitler. It is the most realistic depiction of the situation I had ever seen, and I almost felt a tear in my eye. And that is something, coming from a 40 year old Army veteran. The last 5 minutes, I was on the edge of my seat, when the Russians showed up. Anyway, this movie is totally recommended by me, but brush up on your Nazi history first, or you won't know who is who.",2006
7,"Having watched the film (more than once)i must say that i think that the person who wrote the comment ""A Stupid and Extremely Disappointing Movie"" is being silghtly childish. You cannot watch a film like Van Helsing with out taking it with a pinch of salt - it is a movie with vampires, werewolves and the frankenstine monster in at all at once for goodness sake. So you cannot go in to it thinking in a literal sense. You have to accept that it is not going to be some ground breaking epic and that it is just a bit of fun - but at the end of the day that doesn't matter, because if you go in with the right attitude and you enjoy it, then what does it matter that it is a bit ""off"" in places. I thoroughly enjoyed the film and would definitely recommend it to any one who likes action/fantasy films and is up for a bit of fun!",2005

If people looked at them more as just visually entertaining with a bunch of sharp one-liners, and tried to stop making them the next big action movie, or trying to read a life change message somewhere in there, they'd have more fun! I loved the real mix of actors appearing in this movie - I was straight to IMDb after watching it to see if I was right or wrong about who played who. I especially liked the straight-in beginning - no credit break to kill the run of the film. The black-and-white beginning, going to colour soon after, was not new, but echoed nicely with the old Hollywood movies that the start was echoing. Altogether, a great fun watch. But that's just me!",2005
8,"This is a very ""Stephen Sommers"" film, were you not to know it is the same director as the Mummy you would guess it within 20 minutes. However it should be pointed out that this is not a bad thing at all. The movie is a rip roaring adventure with some wonderful camp humour and great special effects. The plot consists of Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) being part of a special order of the Vatican to kill all unhuman / evil creatures, so amazingly he is sent of to Transylvania where he is to kill Dracula, the sub plot being that Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale) is the last in the line of a family who's mission for centuries has been to kill Dracula themselves. If Anna dies before Dracula, being the last in the line will condemn the whole family to eternal damnation.",2004

2,"This is probably the very best example of what is wrong with Hollywood today. When people around the world complain that Hollywood is churning out over-budgeted, special effects-laden films with brainless plots, this is the first film that comes to mind. It was as if the studio execs knowingly produced a bad film because they simply knew that marketing and stupid effects would draw the undiscerning teens like flies to a corpse. And, I hate to admit it, but if the bottom line is money, then this film was a success. The fact that it made millions is depressing and further supports the notion that crap sells and quality is irrelevant in a bottom-line world. I found it so offensively dumb that I wanted my money back after seeing it--and it was in a dollar theater!! My teenage daughter felt equally appalled and said ""that's an hour and a half of my life down the drain!"". I am so proud of my girl!",2008

10,"If you're a fan of Gothic stories, this movie is just what the doctor ordered. Nearly every conceivable horror creature created for the silver screen is resurrected for this masterpiece. Mary Shelley's Frankenstine born in 1818, Bram Stoker's Dracula penned in 1897, the fable Lycanthrope, Wolfman and even Robert Louis Stevenson's duel identities of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde are part of this magnificent and horrifying menagerie. The story also includes Dracula's Black Transylvanian castle, the pathetic hunchback assistant Igor and an army of throat-ripping, flying children of the night. But just to round-out the story the famed vampire hunter Gabriel Van Helsing takes center stage to this nightmarish saga. The film is called "" Van Helsing "" and is a living tribute to all the horror stories of the 1930's 40 and 50's. What this movie offers is a collection of those dark tales and nightmares we thought we'd forgotten in our youth. Not so, with the incredible special effects this film uses, those black dreams return and are more terrifying than ever. Hugh Jackman plays Van Helsing, with Richard Roxburgh as Count Vladislaus Dracula. Kevin J. O'Connor is Igor and surprisingly Alun Armstrong plays Cardinal Jinette. Samuel West is Dr. Victor Frankenstein with Robbie Coltrane and Stephen Fisher both playing Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde. For those seeking eye candy there is Kate Beckinsale and Josie Maran as Marishka. From start to finish, there is so much action, drama and savage physical confrontation it's nearly impossible to turn away. What puzzles me is the main characters' constantly fall from dizzying heights to crash against everything from thick wooden beams to concrete and stone barriers of all kinds and yet few bones are ever broken. Still, the excitement and enjoyment from this movie are incredible, so much so, it's no wonder it immediately became a Classic. Superb! ****",2009

I won't even get started on the incredible amount of errors in this movie. The writer/director might have well smack the viewer across the face with some of the mistakes they let slide. Needless to say I was extremely disappointed in this movie after looking forward to seeing it for some time. I can only hope that we will not see a sequal to this mistake.

2,"This film is a brilliant and psychologically complex treatise on Victorian era social mores as seen through the eyes of Van Helsing, a rapscallion character who overcomes his impoverished beginnings to climb the social ladder and eventually reach the pinnacle of high society. It's his cockeyed optimism that allows him to go from rags to riches with an almost Dickensian charm, but in classic irony normally suited for Shakespearan tragedy it is also that very trait the leads him on a path to danger and horror. There's also brilliant social satire as seen through the colorful characters from Transylvania, who bring both shock and scathing black humor in their representation of the nomadic, exotic outsiders than so many proper Victorians feared would infiltrate and poison their gilded society.",2005

Never-the-less the jokes are hilarious and the plot flows rather smoothly.",2006

Nice change of scenery for Kristin Kreuk even though she just appears briefly. Scott Mechlowicz continues the good performance he had set in Mean Creek, not to be compared of course, but good performances in both. Michelle Trachtenberg is simply fabulous,she amazes me every time, except in crappy movies like Ice Princess or in ""Buffy"". She shows she can act in Mysterious skin, but just throws her talent away further down the line. As for the story, it's nothing special, title says it all. The only country they miss is Belgium :). It's a comedy people and yes, it's for teens, not a family movie if you want to hear it. You know what you get when you see it, so stop giving bad reviews about this!

And while this movie doesn't properly represent Europe and it's style and it's culture, it does enlist every stereotype Americans have about Europeans, and that's what makes it so damn funny.

What irritated me at lot was the sex scene that took place in the confessional. For God sake, this is too much!!!

It could be done differently. This movie just shows that there are people who are not able to leave puberty behind. Well, if you think, England's inhabited by skinhead-hooligans only, in France everyone's just waiting for some retarded, immature American schoolboys to teach them to laugh, if you further believe every Italian is a gay mafioso, there's still something like the Hitler Youth in Germany and literally every European girl is fired up about the idea of f***ing American idiots like the above mentioned - just enjoy the film!

And as sequels go, it contains many scenes that are mere variations of the original: the dinner gone wrong, the sports competition gone wrong, the pet gone wrong, the Owen Wilson cameo, the ""focker"" puns, etc. But many of the variations are quite inspired. Thanks to the terrific cast. De Niro, Stiller, Hoffman and Streisand all look like they're having a great time. Each is given a scene or two to really shine; De Niro and Hoffman fare the best. A child actor's also been added to the cast, and he's a scene-stealer. I just wish Blythe Danner (Mrs. Byrnes) and Teri Polo (Pam Focker) were given more to do. But, as entertaining as I thought the movie was, expect many critics to be turned off or pretend to be turned off by the numerous toilet jokes. I say, flock 'em!",2004

1,"Meeting the Parents of your girlfriend can be stressful enough. But having her parents meet yours can sometimes be a recipe for disaster, something Greg Focker finds to his peril; when both sets of parents meet on the eve of his wedding. Made after the success of Meet the Parents, Meet the Fockers carries on where the last film left off, with Greg delivering babies while his stuffy future father in laws delivers ultimatums, both with memorable results. Of course Greg is now finally in ""The Circle of Trust"" a circle that is headed by Jack, Greg's uptight future father in law, retired from the CIA, yet still firmly attached to his former profession. Meanwhile Greg's own parents are laid back and free with their emotions, his mother being a sex therapist and his father a house husband. Knowing Jack's conservative ways Greg is delighted but terrified at his fiancés news that they are going to have a baby. Worried of Jacks reaction, things get worse when Greg's old teenage crush reappears, along with a 15 year old son who is a dead ringer for Greg and, as far as Jack's concerned, a prime contender for a DNA test . Meet the Fockers is based purely in the realm of a one joke movie (i.e. the family's name) and so has the longevity of one (i.e. very short) The main problems with the film is the heartbreaking (from a film fans point of view) sight of Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand all participating in a film that Benny Hill would have passed at. Streisand, the powerhouse all singing and acting legend, is here reduced to teaching senior citizens how to have better sex, something I could have lived without seeing. Hoffman is clearly having fun, although quite unaware that the audience isn't. His scenes with De Niro have a chemistry, but the scenes themselves do little to their reputations. One scene with Hoffman sitting on a toilet and De Niro in the shower waiting for him to ""finish"" really felt like an all time low, and when Hoffman flushed I hoped their careers wasn't going down with it. One high point is the appearance of Owen Wilson (Stiller's Hutch to his Starsky) who shows up at the end, but by that time I was too busy sawing through my wrists. Meet the Fockers has an incredible waste of exceptional talent, and that my friends is no laughing matter.",2005

I decided that since it remained at the top of the box office for another week, maybe, just maybe there was something redeeming about it. There isn't. Nothing. And the audience agreed. There were probably 20 of us and not one person - not one - laughed at any point in this movie. It is one of the most pathetic wastes of talent since - since - since I don't know what. Shame on everyone associated with this horribly unfunny movie.",2005

The female characters aren't given much to do, but give adequate performances. Not being a Streisand fan, I was a little apprehensive about her casting, but am pleased to say that she is very good in the role and stands toe-to-toe with hubby Hoffman. The movie is quickly paced and provides very little ""down time"" where the comedy bogs down. It's a great mix of slap-stick, witty banter, strong comedic performances, crude humor and even cutesy fowl mouthed toddlers. To me all these high brow critics need to lighten up. Comedies should be judged by whether or not they are funny and that's it. The bottom line with this film is that it's hilarious. All those critics are coming off as smug ass hoooooooooles.",2004

Come to think of it, there was nothing funny about it full stop.

That, my dears is something that if you do not know now, will find out in the future years to come. In my mind the purpose is to be entertained but Hollywood doesn't seem to think like that.

The dispute between the ""Focker-ized"" and very ""Zen"" family and the rigid and paranoid Jack Byrnes made me burst in a ""non-stop laughing"" mode not only along the movie, but also after, recalling the funny scenes and gags. The talent of Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro as comedians is very well-known by the audiences, but Dustin Hoffman surprised me how funny he is. Barbra Streisand is also excellent, and the jokes with the English word ""Focker"" are great.

Gregs last name was a humorous topic in Meet the Parents, but it really falls flat in the sequel. Every two minutes they try to spin off a joke about focker or gaylord and it seriously got old in the first two minutes of the sequel. As for the rest of the movie it was incredibly unbelievable. The reason Meet the Parents was so successful is because the audience can relate to Gregs situation meeting the parents and the unfortunate situations that come about. If you plan on seeing this movie I really hope you still go to stitches every time you here the word focker and do not mind a mediocre sequel with cheap laughs.

Jack wants to know if Greg came from a good gene pool. Jack discovers that the Fockers are very strange. The Dad (Dustin Hoffman) is a hippie and retired lawyer, and the Mom (Barbara Streisand) is an open sex therapist. Jack begins to thinks this is not a good family for his daughter to marry into. Greg's parents are so proud of Greg that they have a wall of honor with Greg's ninth and tenth place sports awards. The two families try to become one family. This was one hilarious movie, which I laughed from beginning to end. This is proof of the old adage, that actors don't like to work with children and animals, because they stole the movie. The child spoke with sign language and had some of the best comedy scenes of the movie. The toilet scene with the cat and dog was just so funny. (Universal, Run time 1:30, Rated PG-13) (8/10)",2004
1,"Like virtually all mainstream releases, *Meet the Fockers* is, of course, really too awful to warrant an amateur review: only the professionals should be forced to deal with the dreary task. But a movie whose cast includes Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman, and Barbra Streisand would SEEM to invite discussion. Thirty years ago, such a cast would have indicated a Major Motion Picture. In 2005, I'm sorry to report that these living-legend actors have been inducted -- however profitably to themselves -- in the ongoing mission to Keep DreamWorks Afloat. The Stiller/De Niro ""franchise"" has officially joined the *Shrek* series as an anomalous money-maker for the studio. The creative bankruptcy of Messrs. Spielberg, Geffen, and Katzenberg resulted in the demise of both the TV and music units of the company; and as for the movie-wing of the operation, that creative bankruptcy has never been more clearly demonstrated than with *Meet the Fockers*.",2005
10,"I think this movie was fantastic, it was absolutely great. There was tons of laughter, and it didn't drag on like most movies does. It wasn't the same old jokes, and it wasn't the same old boring continuation of Pam and Gaylords lifes, they actually had new story lines and something else because they were able to develop two new characters and give this something new. The characters were great, real funny material, they were real down to earth characters. Its cool how they took laid back people and matched them with pams parents, who are strict and uptight, makes for great comedy. Even the animals were freaking hilarious, not the same old story line where you make something else boring happen, this had life and was a great sequel. It was worth making the trip out in the freezing cold.",2004
1,"Do not see this movie. Do not spoil the affable ""Meet the Parents"" with the thoroughly unpleasant ""Meet the Fockers"". Do not replace the memory of so many fine and respectable performances by these veteran actors over several decades with the vulgar and idiotic antics you will see in this movie. Let's not continue to perpetuate this kind of moronic movie making. The first film was very funny, along the lines of ""Flirting with Disaster"". It's not just that the bathroom humor is distasteful - it's distracting. You often wonder when seeing a sophomoric film what it would have been like without the crude humor. You don't have to wonder, in this case - the same film exists without the crassness of the sequel. These two films could be used in a writing class as examples of how a scene, or a whole movie, could be funnier without playing to the lowest common denominator. In America that denominator appears to be getting lower, year after year.",2004
9,"When I went to see Meet the Fockers I was expecting to see another bad Hollywood sequel, as Ocean's twelve, but luckily it was as good as the original. The new characters, specially the one played by Dustin Hofman, who did a superb job, were really hilarious and added a new dynamic to the story. The lowest point of this film were the scenes that involved the baby (Pam's sister son), instead of spend so much time with him ,the writers should have developed more Owen Wilson's character. It may not be the best comedy ever made, but Meet the Fockers is a very good and funny movie, with excellent performances and a good script.",2005
6,"I beg to disagree with most of the critics on this one. I actually liked this movie a little better than 'Meet the Parents', and it is very rare for me to prefer a sequel to the original. There was some good acting in this movie, which is no wonder given the caliber of the cast. Make no mistake, this was definitely not a masterpiece, the script could have been better and the last 20 minutes of the film are a little overdone and cheesy, but all in all a decent, entertaining movie.",2006
1,"I should have listened to the critics, but I didn't. The first sequel was merely OK. I remember I laughed at least a couple of times. My friend and I saw ""Meet the Fockers"" at the cinema. It was so incredibly boring that nobody, I repeat, _nobody_ in the audience laughed. Not even once. Maybe it's the cold weather that makes all Swedes down in the dumps, but I refuse to believe that. This film is simply BORING!",2005
6,"Gliding on the good graces of its predecessor, this new installment has very little to showcase in the way of ground breaking comedy. Not that anyone would expect a sequel to 'Meet the Parents' as being a 'departure film' or a film that would ever titillate its audience with anything close to resembling an 'over the line' type of comedy. No, this film is just a very safe and predictable sequel.",2006
9,"I would also like to comment on the fact that TCOR received bad reviews. Personally, I think that Vin Diesel should continue making the movies from the other screenplays that have already been written. The plot in these films (TCOR and Pitch Black) is actually quite original. From an action standpoint, the films do not lack anything. Riddick is the bad ass anti-hero that we would all like to be sometimes and they couldn't have cast the parts any better. There are some similarities between the Necros in TCOR and the Borg in the latter Star Trek movies, but who cares? David Twohy put a great spin on the Necro collective and I am eagerly awaiting another sequel. Anyone who likes Scifi and enjoys fantastic visuals will love this movie.",2005
8,"I thought this movie was riveting. It did start a little slow, but soon thereafter caught my full attention. I had to change mental gears from expecting a Pitch Black sequel/clone, but not in a bad way at all. And there ARE tie-ins with Pitch Black plainly evident unless you aren't particularly observant or haven't seen Pitch Black. I thought the special effects were some of the best I have seen in a very long time, and after I began to become adjusted to the more involved background story, I found it engrossing. I felt that the characters had some depth to them. Enough for me to care a little about a few of them anyway, and Riddick became a little less of a cardboard cut-out, and a little more intricate in this movie. Some of the action sequences are also pretty impressive. I find it quite disappointing that this did not do better in theaters, and intend my rental to become a purchase. I hope that they continue the series with the next one? or two? movies that have been rumored to be following. ",2004
10,"I am not sure why this movie caught to much bad press. It is a very very solid sci-fi/action movie. Its completely different from the first one but in a good way. Pitch Black was sci-fi/horror not action. The action sequences in this are amazing as well as the fight sequences. Vin Diesel was born to play this character like Arnold to the Terminator. The special effects, fights and action make this movie a balls to the wall fun flick. If you have not seen it because of all the nay sayers, I say hogwash, wow never thought i would use hogwash in a sentence. I've seen this one three times now with different people and everyone who sees it ends up really liking it and asking themselves why they haven't seen it before this. Check this one out for certain.",2005
10,"I only saw the directors cut, but apparently that makes all the difference, and so i think the 6.1 rating may not be representative. I never felt like i was lost or something could be better explained. ",2004
9,"This is one weird rating from all the fine subscribers to IMDb. For the first time in, my albeit limited experience, the previously flawless rating system has, in my opinion, got it way wrong.",2005
8,"Just had fun watching TCOR and am pretty happy about it. Good action, great visual stuff. A worthy successor to Pitch Black, though the two films are hardly related. Vin Diesel does a good and convincing job at playing an action antihero. As usual, Judy Dench adds to the film, even though her role is small here. The story is pure pulp SF and is short and predictable but is refreshingly dark and (mostly) unsentimental. It actually also has some interesting bits and nice side stories as a (smallish) bonus. Bits and pieces have been copied from Dune, without the film being a Dune copy. Compared to Dune, TCOR has more action and fewer Lynch oddities & boring bits. In my book, both films are good, about equally so.",2005
10,"WOW! What a surprise! A very well thought-out plot, excellent character development, immersive sets, and special effects that melt into the fabric of the movie so well, they all but disappear. I was not expecting to be absolutely glued to the screen when I first sat down to watch this movie, but I was. It pulls you in like a roller coaster ride, and doesn't let you off, until the ride is over. A performance from Vin Disel, that is arguably his best ever, not to mention he was also a producer of this movie. My compliments to your ability to recognize a good story, and to bring it to such life.",2005
10,"Once again Vin Diesel brings to life the vicious, calculating anti-hero Riddick, the convict who prefers to kill instead of negotiate. Riddick is living a life of arduous survival, preferring the isolation of the frozen planet to the company of humans. When he learns the Imam is the man who has set the bounty for him, he journeys to discover why. Keith David recreates the Imam from Pitch Black as if he had never left the role, and introduces us to Aereon, the elemental being in the form of Judi Dench, whose powerful acting and presence adds both drama and authenticity to the film. Nick Chinlund excels in a role custom made for him, and Colm Feore is magnificent as the Lord Marshal, the holy half-dead who has seen the Underverse. Linus Roache, in one of two films he has worked on with Diesel (the other, Find Me Guilty, perhaps led to his role as the Assistant DA on Law and Order), and while his role is not as big as I would have liked, his presence and eloquence as the Purifier adds significantly to the film. Karl Urban, who has appeared in other fantasy roles (Priest, Star Trek), presents a more powerful, controlled soldier of the faith, while Thandie Newton as his ambitious wife provides the right balance to the struggle for power within any authoritarian regime. Alexa Davalos is excellent as Kyra, defiant and deadly to the last. Even the extended version is rated PG-13 for language and violence, but little sexual content. Since Vin will be recreating Riddick in a third film next year, I would say this is a collectible if you are a fan of the first two, or just a fan of good science fiction.",2012
10,"I liked this movie. Nice special effects, humorous dialogues, action... in a word - enjoyable. But is this really Sci-Fi? The unexplained ""half alive and half... something else"" attribute of Lord Marshal reduces a little bit the scientific aspect of the movie, but this can be forgiven.",2005
10,"I just saw this film and I really enjoyed it. Sure, it is not the same a ""Pitch Black"" which I think was also a good film in its own right. ""Chronicles of Riddick"" is a big budget summer blockbuster film and on that level it succeeds. Sure it is silly in parts but we are not discussing a project based upon a Pulitzer Prize winning novel. It is action packed science fiction. I think Riddick DID stay true to the character he played in ""Pitch Black"". While the Riddick in that film was a brutal, self-centered opportunist, I think we see by the end of that film that he had good characteristics as well. The Riddick in this film is still brutal, self-centered and opportunistic (see the full size statue of Riddick shown during the end credits) but we see more of the decent aspects of his character as well. The action scenes in this film were great! I especially enjoyed the ""topside"" chase scene on Cremetoria. And Thandie Newton was a really good ""baddie""!",2004
10,"First off, I'm going to say this: I loved this movie, but this movie was slugged by the press, and for whatever reason, people were listening to the critics, and not going to see it, or for that matter, giving this movie a fair chance at the box-office. I think people listen to the critics too much these days, and that's really sad, because so many good movies have never gotten their fair share of recognition over the years. Anyways, this movie had many things that Sci-Fi movies are lacking these days....originality. The Crematoria concept was brilliant, Helion-Prime, all that stuff was great. The back story was also very thorough and entertaining, so what's the problem? Also, I heard a lot of people were bitching about the ending....IT'S MEANT TO BE A TRILOGY PEOPLE!!!! Of course they won't spill everything right away, it's meant to be told over two more films. And the DVD tied up ant lose ends that we needed to know. I heard of the concept for the next two, and the possibility of a prequel, and it's sounds incredible. I hope they fund the next two, because this story needs to be told. It seems that ever since Vin Diesel became a Hollywood commodity, every critic and their best friend has been trying to down everything he does lately, I don't get it....he's got the talent, appreciate it. Anyways, I think this movie is a great beginning to an epic story, check it out for yourselves, don't listen to the critics....they didn't even like Star Wars, until it got so popular that they had no choice but to praise it. Anyways, like I said go see it for yourselves, make up your own mind, 8 or 9 times out of 10, you'll be surprised at what the outcome is when individuality reigns over listening to critic's vendettas on originality.",2005
10,"Great film. I really liked it, being a great fan of Pitch Black (2000). The universe of Riddick is really impressive and way different from the (boring and predictable) other sci-fi titles nowadays (except, maybe Firefly).",2005
8,"This film has gotten terrible reviews, and I feel as if its bad press is undeserving. It's a good film, and it frustrates me that people hate this movie. So what if it doesn't have a good, original plot? What movie does have a good original plot? Look at Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. That movie didn't have an original plot, but yet people praised that movie to high heaven.",2004
8,"Once you're a convicted character in the movies, your life span can continue far longer than it would be allowed in reality. In the film "" The Chronicles of Reddick"" we have such a warrior who for lack of better luck, is forever re-earning the title, hero. Richard Reddick (Vin Diesel) is the last Furian from his planet. We accept that, then we stumble over another Furian. Nevertheless, his race of people have been singled out for total genocide, by a war-driven nation called the Necromongers. Their leader is called The Lord Marshal (Colm Feore) who perceives himself a doomed man, due to the prophesy which warns, a Furian will take his life. To protect himself, he employs powerful people like his second in command. Lord Vaako (Karl Urban) and Dame Vaako (Thandie Newton) both swear allegiance to the Lord Marshal, but secretly scheme to take his place. Judi Dench plays Aereon, an 'Elemental.' She like 'The Purifier' (Linus Roache) are rare individuals who are necessary for security but cause concern to the Lord Marshal. If these were not enough to complicate Reddick's life, he must try and stay ahead of the band of Mercs, who vow to collect the high price on his head. The best of the Mercs is an old friend, soldier/warrior and experienced Mercenary named Toombs. (Nick Chinlund). The line of enemies is bad enough, but there's more like a special Universal religion called 'Under-verse' which promises utopia to the converted. Reddic and his friends are targeted for this and if they do not submit, then death. With all the special effects and grand art sets in this film, the movie should make itself very interesting if not down-right memorable. It's a great story, but pay close attention. ****",2007
9,"'The Chronicles of Riddick' seems to be receiving unfair flak. I can understand why in most cases, but I question whether some of the critics have seen the film. After all, it can hardly be considered a 'nominal sequel', as one critic stated. There is nothing nominal about it, when compared with 'Pitch Black'. A 'nominal' sequel to this film would no doubt take some people back to the planet it was set on, and face the same monsters again - and more of them. Most likely, the people would not be at all related to the first film. That is the suit that most sequels follow - more of the same. Chronicles is certainly not this. In fact, it is hardly a sequel at all - which is perhaps why it has never once been pegged as one.",2004
7,"In the prologue of ""The Chronicles of Riddick"", Dame Judi Dench as Aereon, leader of the Elemental race, declares that to battle great evil sometimes requires ""another kind of evil"". That ""evil"" she speaks of would be Riddick, played by Vin Diesel. Perhaps Riddick (Diesel) is another kind of evil. Although he seems more the classic rogue warrior, beholding to none, who eventually transcends to an avatar. He becomes the chosen one in a battle between good and evil-- a battle that initially was never his nor did have any stake in it. David Towhy's ""Chronicles of Riddick"", which follows the main character of his ""Pitch Black"", is very unwieldy, needlessly convoluted, and ambitious in scale and scope. That being said, I enjoyed the movie largely because of Vin Diesel, and the appeal of the character Riddick. Here is the deal. The Elementals are some kind of ethereal guardian race, who follow some sort of doctrine of non-intervention. Ultimately, they are part of the storyline. The great evil are the Necromongers, a ruthless fascist military race, bent on the genocide of all humans throughout the galaxy. Their leader is the omnipotent, Lord Marshall (Colm Feore). The dark Lord is hinted to be ""half living and..."" Aereon (Dench) prophesies that the powerful Lord will die by the hand of a Furion, member of the extinct elite warrior race. In the prophesy, Riddick is that Furion. Hence, the mythology is in place. Unlike the very poorly done messiah tale of ""The Matrix Revolutions"", Twohy's ""Riddick"" does not really take itself so seriously. This is a good thing. ",2004

9,"Riddick might not have been the *best*-made movie this summer, but it was my favorite. It had more action than Spider-Man 2, and was darker than Harry Potter 3. I also think it had more interesting ideas and a greater visual flair than both of these films. Riddick was total escapist fun, with lots of funny one-liners and Vin Diesel playing his best character, Riddick. Other great performances were given by Karl Urban (looking very anti-Eomer in his black mohawk) and especially, the bounty hunter Tooms (?).",2004
9,"Frankly I do not understand what all the fuss is about with many of the reviews. Look, if you want to see an Ibsen play, go the the theater.

Ok, so you have to be a SciFi friend, especially with a liking for Farscape, Dune or Lexx. ",2004

10,"I don't get the score on IMDb, I understand sci fi is not every once cup of tea, but this film has no real flaws. Great cast, fantastic decor, story line, lots of action and so on. So where did the score of 6.4 come from? I tend to give most films of any type a go, based on the points pointed out why this film is great, no matter if it is action, drama, horror and so on. I gave this film a 10 as I just can't fault it, and after not seeing it for some time, and to be captured again by this master piece, is not something I come across that often in the world of crap films. If I would watch a type of film thats not something I would go for, but it is directed well, great cast as points made before, would I score the film so low as with this film? No give credit where its due! If you like sci fi than try this, watch it in Blue Ray, as this film is eye candy just on the decor alone. Best film Vin has made so far, and lets hope they do a decent follow up on this. 10 out of 10 for me, and I am sure I will watch this film many more times in years to come.",2010
3,"Get's a vote of three because admittedly the production design is very beautiful, but otherwise this film is a huge disappointment. Where Pitch Black (to which it is a sequel) was a simple, taut and highly effective little low budget sci fi horror this is a sprawling incoherent mess. Twohy clearly works far better when limited by a smaller budget. Here he just does not seem to know where he's going. The narrative is muddled and episodic with very little clear sense of how one scene links to the next. The performances are generally wooden with many of the cast simply looking rather embarrassed by the clunking pseudo mythic dialogue they have to spout. You'd need to be a real sci-fi fanatic to get much out of this one (other than a strong sense of irritation).",2008
9,This movie is jammed with action and unreal special effects. I don't know how they captured the unique and foreboding terrains the warriors sprinted across.,2004
7,"This is a fun movie that most everyone in the family can enjoy. It's rated PG, has some violence, but no nudity and no language. Younger kids will probably not understand the Masonic and Knights Templar references, but they'll probably still enjoy it. The only thing anyone needs to understand about the Masons is the Knights Templar eventually became the Masons, and many of our founding fathers were Masons, so there's a bit of Masonic lore/connection tied into the movie. Other than that, it's easy to follow. Ben Gates is chasing a dream of finding a lost treasure, the map to which is supposedly hidden on the back of the Declaration of Independence. He steals the Declaration, then takes off on his adventure to find the treasure. To put it simply, ""National Treasure"" will remind you of a cross between the Indiana Jones trilogy (minus the snakes) and ""Ocean's 11"" (minus the drinking and profanity). You don't have to be a genius to watch it, and you don't have to be a history nut to understand it. No, there isn't really a map on the back of the Declaration of Independence (Is there?), but Indiana Jones didn't actually find the Ark, either. It's a fun, fantasy, what-if, kind of movie. Enjoy it.",2005
7,"National Treasure was not on my must-watch list. but it turned out to be a most pleasant surprise. the history behind the show may not be accurate and it also has around it, an air of mystery, but it certainly was a fun filled ride with the face-paced action flicks! I'm NOT a particular Cage fan. nonetheless i had to admit he did a pretty good job as Ben Gates - slightly serious yet very witty! together with Riley, they provided the tickles that brought the audience through the entire film.",2004
7,"""National Treasure"" is a thriller that was obviously targeted for young audiences. John Turtletaub, its director, has created a film that will resonate with those audiences because of the great ride and the adventure it depicts.

7,"This was a fun film, sort of like an Indian Jones movie, but the treasure hunter must figure out clues. I'm sure the reason this was made and released now has a lot to do with the Da Vinci Code.

7,"I am NOT, repeat, NOT, a Nicolas Cage fan, mainly because he relies too much on action to carry his films (instead of his acting), but this is a pretty decent flick. There is enough action and suspense to keep the viewer's interest and also to maintain the pace of the film. There's actually not very much actual violence (strange for a Cage film!), but the story is so well-written that even Cage can pull it off without any gore. The basic story has been reviewed several times, but it's the continuation of a 200 year old treasure hunt. Cage must solve riddle after riddle to find the ultimate clue to the treasure's whereabouts. The clue is finally determined to be on the back of the Declaration of Independence. How Cage figures the clue that leads him there is pretty far-fetched but its the key to the story. If you buy into that, the rest of the riddles are acceptable. There's also a double cross plot headed by the great Sean Bean that provides a lot of the action. The lovely Diane Kruger portrays the poor lady who gets caught up in the middle of all this intrigue. Overall, except for the figuring out of the clue found in the ship (the viewer just has to assume that he's that far above the rest of us in intelligence), a pretty exciting film with a little something for everyone.",2004

6,"NATIONAL TREASURE (3 outta 5 stars) After hearing some of the initial reviews I was expecting something of a train wreck here. Actually, the movie is not bad at all... in a cheesy kind of Saturday afternoon time-killing way. Some of the actions of the characters strain credibility at times... but if you just sit back and let the plot play out it's all quite entertaining. A pair of eccentric treasure hunters pick up a female ally along the way as they try to beat a rich bad man at finding the greatest cache of treasure of all time. Nicolas Cage gives an effortlessly engaging lead performance. His male and female sidekicks (Diane Kruger and Justin Bartha) play off him quite well. The main villain (Sean Bean) is a more low-key bad guy than we tend to see in movies these days... he doesn't go on and on ranting and raving and screaming to prove how bad he is... he just proves it quite matter-of-factly through his actions. Jon Voigt and Harvey Keitel do alright in a couple of minor roles that don't do much for their acting cred but probably gave their bank accounts a boost. It didn't even strike me until the very end that this was indeed a Disney MOVIE... one very much like the adventure movies they used to put out in the 50s. I was also pleasantly surprised that there were less dumb action stunts than I expected. The two major stunt scenes in the film (a car chase and a stairway cave-in) were pretty un-inspired... the movie wisely concentrates more on plot and dialogue.",2004

According to generations of folklore, there is a clue on the back of the Declaration that will sustain the procession of clues leading to the treasure.

7,"""National Treasure"" is a suspenseful, gripping, action packed, fast moving treasure hunt that holds your attention from beginning to end. That is, if you are ten years old. My ten year old nephew was leaning forward making the odd comment of awe throughout the film. I can say ""National Treasure"" is a fine family film for older children to enjoy with their parents. But from an adults point of view, much of this movie is plain silly. I won't provide spoilers, but within 15 minutes into ""National Treasure"" you will know what I mean. I agree with other viewers that this movie is an Indiana Jones wanna be. It is not ""Raiders"". Nicolas Cage, for whatever reason, provides a rather flat performance falling well short of Harrison Ford. The clues are also really far-reaching and formulaic. Connect the dots.

The film is little more than an extended advert for the Freemasons.However these Freemasons are not your usual shopkeepers who use funny handshakes and play golf, these Freemasons are the natural descendants of the Knights Templar (and nobody mention 'From Hell' or Jack the Ripper.)I don't think I've revealed any plot spoilers because there are none.

You'd think with all the work that's gone on in New York underground That room would have been discovered before. and all that was constructed during the civil war? PLEASE And the love story between Ben and Abigail?? how cute, and I thought the romance in Clive Cussler novels was weak. They just fall in love like that, in 2 seconds WHATEVER I'd be more concerned with saving my own ass then getting some. the hell with the girl and the stupid piece of paper. 1/10 Garbage",2005
1,"After sitting through this pile of dung, my husband and I wondered whether it was actually the product of an experiment to see whether a computer program could produce a movie. It was that listless and formulaic. But the U.S. propaganda thrown in your face throughout the film proves--disappointingly--that it's the work of humans. Call me a conspiracy theorist, but quotes like, ""We have to steal the Declaration of Independence to protect it"" seem like ways to justify actions like the invasion of Iraq, etc. The fact that Nicholas Cage spews lines like, ""I would never use the Declaration of Independence as a bargaining chip"" with a straight face made me and my husband wonder whether the entire cast took Valium before shooting each scene. The ""reasoning"" behind each plot turn and new ""clue"" is truly ridiculous and impossible to follow. And there's also a bonus side plot of misogyny, with Dr. Whatever-Her-Name-Was being chided by all involved for ""never shutting up."" She's clearly in the movie only for looks, but they felt the need to slap a ""Dr."" title on her character to give her some gravity. At one point, Cage's character says, ""Don't you ever shut up?"" and the camera pans to her looking poutily down at her hands, like she's a child. Truly grotesque. The only benefit to this movie was that it's so astonishingly bad, you do get a few laughs out of it. The really scary thing is that a majority of the people watching the movie with us seemed to enjoy it. Creepy....",2005
7,"National Treasure is an underrated, implausible, yet very entertaining action/adventure flick that really relies on the plot and intrigue rather than explosion filled action sequences.",2005
9,"Not realistic, in thinking that the Declaration of Independence can be accessed (in 2 ways in 5 minutes which is unbelievable); but in how the action parts are plausible, disregarding that a shotup van in Washington would have a relatively easy getaway. No sickening KillBill or ruthless Gladiator. This movie had a great plot, wonderful casting and amazing research. The directing got 100% from its actors, and even though the fiction rates up their with Indiana Jones, it matches those epics with glory. Give credit to it as did its cast and producer. Also refreshing is the subject of history with a bit of romance. Maybe Men are from Mars and Woman from Venus. History brings romance with substance. Although Maid in Manhattan is a fine Chick Flick with character, I now have another gem that rates up their with Kate and Leopold; National Treasure. 9 popcorns out of 10.",2005

Me being interested in history enormously thought this film could be quite a lot of fun... I did not expect to be that wrong!

9,"This film is neither preachy nor pedantic, and was a welcome surprise for me. As a non-Christian who nevertheless respects the historical figure of Jesus Christ and the beauty of his philosophy and teachings, I found The Passion to be a powerful portrayal of much that I think is worthwhile about the Christ story. I know the film has been maligned for anti-semitic content (perhaps because Jews make mistakes in the film and are seen as persecutors instead of victims? - it could have been anybody!), and for various other problems - but let's face it - any movie portraying this subject was bound to face strong reactions. And kudos to Mel Gibson for not shying away from the subject by creating a sterile, gutless, Disney story out of what really was a good example of the everyday horror of life on the fringes of the Roman empire. Gibson invents a new genre with The Passion - that of historical horror. ",2005

10,"Obviously there are some people who are rather ignorant about the words they use and what the Passion of the Christ actually is supposed to be. The one user who said ""There is nothing passionate about this movie"" obviously did not research the meaning of the word Passion. The English word has its roots in the Latin passio, which means, simply, ""suffering.""",2004
10,"A lot of critics I have heard disliked or even dismissed this movie.  They seemed to think that the movie should have focused on Christ's ministry and his teachings, and not on the crucifixion and the events leading up to it. These critics miss the point of this movie.  As with all movies, The Passion was directed at a target audience, in this case Christians.  The point of the movie was simply this: to make Christians understand, in a visceral way, what they knew intellectually from reading the bible: that Christ endured a horrible and brutal death in order to save us from our sins.  It was completely successful in this, and was, perhaps, the most powerful movie I have ever seen.",2004

It is now 3 years later, and I saw the film once in the theaters, and I remember it like I saw it yesterday. And this is coming from someone who still hasn't made up his mind about religion. This is a one of a kind film that will affect you as long as you have a pulse. For those jaded enough to just view the film as anti-Semitic or just plain hooey, then perhaps I will stipulate that you will find something wrong with it. But for anyone who at least has a humanitarian side to them, this movie will get inside you and never leave.",2007
10,"You may have an experience like this in a movie theater, once in a lifetime. I haven't been able to take those images out of my mind. What an incredible achievement. It works in so many different levels that it would be impossible to list them. It touched me in a way no film has done before. It provoked such degree of hatred around my neck of the woods, that it goes to prove how the devil reacts to holy water. Most people I spoke to in Los Angeles had made up their minds about the film before actually seeing it. What's that all about? At the end of the day Mel Gibson had the last laugh or the right to have it, although I don't believe that he is laughing. He seems to be unafraid, fueled by his faith and convictions, a man of his word. That in itself must confuse the hell out of Hollywood. All religious considerations to one side this is an artistic masterpiece. You may agree or disagree, but why not to make up your own mind?",2004
10,"I've seen a lot o people talking trash about this movie - even a lot of christians -, and I find it hard to understand why. Philosopher Peter Kreeft called it the ""most beautiful movie ever made"", and when I think about it in the light of the Christian faith, it's hard to disagree.",2015

9,"This movie was really good and very religiously inspiring. The brutality of some of the seems should not of been the focus of so many movie reviews because it was only secondary to the true message in the movie of love and what true love made a man do for all of mankind. It emphasised how much Jesus suffered for all of us. Beside this so many film critics and people who had problems with both Mel Gibson and the Catholic Church said this film was anti-semitic but i agree with Mel Gibson when he says that this film was just going along with what is said in the gospels and who accuses the gospels of being antisemetic? No one, because it isn't and had a message of forgiveness predominately in it as does the Passion of Christ - it does'nt leave out Jesus saying 'Father forgive them for they know not what they do' - Jesus forgave those responsible for his death and everyone - some Jews were responsible for his death as were some Romans and some future Catholics but we do not hold anything against the other Jews or of the time or those Jews andothers actually responsible or against any Jews now or any descendants of those who might've had a part in Jesus' death and those that claim to be Catholic and do are not Catholic truly. This movie is a inspiring movie and the talent of Mel Gibson indirecting and producing it is evident in the quality of the filming and the the way in which the sequence of events along with flashbacks is portrayed.",2006
10,"""Why is this night unlike any other night?"" Mary Mother of Jesus asks Mary Magdalene on the night Christ is arrested, to which Magdalene replies, ""Because once we were slaves, and now we are free"". This, in my interpretation, forges a quite beautiful link between Judiasm and Christianity, as this question and answer, or some variation of it, is recited at traditional Passover Seders to commemorate the beginning of ancient Jews' escape from their Egyptian overlords, but could also apply here to those of us, including myself, who are believers that Christ was and is the Son of God, as we see this night as the beginning of our ""freedom"" from eternal death and the end of our ""slavery"" to sin.",2007

1,"I am not a very religious person, but I sure find the bible (new and old testament) very intriguing. When I saw of the movie ""passion of the Christ"" I saw a small fraction of Jesus life, which might be very factual to the bible, but (in my opinion) did not make a big change for the religion. Through out Jesus's life, he taught all the good things of the Christian religion, not through his torture and death. I mean, how many martyrs have been tortured and killed? If I made a movie about the passion of Che or some other person, I would not get the religious vote, instead I would be marked as a gore movie writer. I don't know. I didn't like the movie as a movie, because it was basically the same thing I would see at the butchery, and religiously speaking, the movie did not speak to me.",2007
10,"I saw this movie the night it came out with my boyfriend. We are both Roman Catholic. My bf is more ""religious"" than I am, I'll admit, but after seeing this movie, I think I really understand and appreciate why I was Baptized and Confirmed. If you are Catholic or Christian or whatever you want to call your beliefs in Christ, do yourself a favor and see this movie. (Don't worry, it's far less gory on your home TV.) About three minutes into the movie until the bitter end and past the credits, my boyfriend and I held each other and cried. Mel Gibson, BRAVO. Who knew he had it in him? I thought he was just another rich movie star. Mel, if you read these YOUR MOVIE WAS AB SOUL UTELY BRILLIANT! I never really understood why my Mom wanted me to go to Church and why she cried and was so insulted when I told her two days before my Confirmation that I was having doubts. My Mom believed in something I could not grasp by the teachings of my Church alone. Maybe it's because we are so used to gore in today's society that I didn't really think twice that Jesus had to endure all these things. Maybe it's because no one takes the time to show and explain to kids just exactly what all those lashings would do to your flesh.",2004
1,"I think most every critique I've heard pro and con about THE PASSION so far has been colored by ideological glasses. The Jewish contingent hated it because they perceived it as portraying the Jews in a bad light. I understand that, but I can find lots of titles that portray different groups not to their liking. My criticism -- the real objection to how the Jews were portrayed -- was that they were nothing but caricatures, the result of a terrible script and worse directing.",2005

I started to watch it for one reason and one reason only -> Kristen Bell. Stupid I know, but when I saw the pilot episode I knew that this show will be something new, something different, something worth watching and I was hooked. The is one of the best TV shows that my eyes have ever seen before. Smart and funny dialogs, beautiful and talented cast of the show, interesting twists,mysteries... This show has everything.

First of all, there are very few TV shows out there that are in every way true to life. Of course the situations aren't completely plausible!

Kristen Bell is the star and she is perfect in her role as the teen-aged detective. The story lines are crisp and always move along. You won't be stuck for seasons (as is the case in some shows) wondering when the story will move along, when the clues will all come together, and when resolution will come. Veronica Mars manages to find a mystery, keep you entertained with subsequent smaller mysteries, keep you intrigued as you find the clues throughout the season to the arc mystery, and wrap up the case. Though the show can lose focus at times with too much going on, it all will eventually be wrapped together and the writers really do learn from their mistakes, can admit that, and subsequently make amends. Hopefully, the show will find a much bigger audience and better schedule (not going months without airing) with the move to the CW. While the show has an often revolving door of supporting characters, the dynamic between Veronica and her father (Enrico Colantoni) is one of the best on TV. Also, throughout the seasons Jason Dohring has emerged his Logan Echolls as a breakout character (and the third most important) who has incredible chemistry with Veronica.

The reviews for The Machinist are way up there, which I suspect increased my expectations. Regardless of the reviews, I would have watched it merely for Bale's decision to be in it.

What Bale did to his body for this movie alone creeps under the audience's skin, and his crisis of guilt and self-loathing create a sub-reality that is inescapable.

And this one is a perfect example. Here you've got a very elementary (and mediocre) scripted thriller, one of those in which the director necessarily has to insert junk filming in between start and end in order to ""comply"" to the 90 minute minimum. Comparing this film to Memento or Angel Heart (just to mention two REAL masterpieces) is plain blasphemy. There is no way Memento or Angel Heart could last 15 minutes for example. But this one could perfectly fit even in 10. I still have to underrate in order to try average real rating. For me, true real rating for this one is 5 out of ten, not a cent more. Only worth if free on TV or cable. And if you are in ""visually dark"" mood, of course.",2005

Christian Bale, although one of my favorite actors since American Psycho, clinched my top spot with this one. His physical transformation will never be matched, and his acting is flawless. Both thought provoking and horrifying at the same time, it is a movie centered around guilt, decisions, and revelation.

2,"I think this may be one of the most overrated movies ever made, but I understand why it won an Oscar. The LA location and the heavy melodramatic discussion on race makes it perfect for the judges of the Oscars. ",2016

1,"*Very Minor Spoilers, but who cares because YOU DO NOT WANT TO SEE THIS FILM* I purchased this DVD because it had won the Academy Award for best picture. Directly after viewing it, I crushed the DVD into tiny little pieces and disposed of it because the film is absolute garbage. It should be re-named to ""Racial Clichés that Have Been Depicted in Films Millions of Times."" I felt compelled to come to IMDb and give it a one star rating because there is no way that this movie should be in rated in the top 250.",2007
6,"Decent acting throughout the movie although the rapper was probably the best actor in the movie (forgot his name). Beyond predictable from start to finish. Yes I got emotional when I thought the girl got shot, that was a tear jerker for sure, but something about this movie was so artificial (in typical 'hollyweird' fashion) that it just didn't leave me with anything to feel for in the end. Maybe it was the characters not being genuine enough, maybe it was the portrayal of certain stereotypes we've all come to know and not appreciate. Hard to put a finger on it.",2006
1,"""Did IQs just drop sharply while I was away (Sigourney Weaver in Aliens (1986))?"" Or have I crossed over into some alternative ""Twilight Zone"" universe where ugly is beautiful and bad is good? On March 5, 2006, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences did something so inexplicable that my head is still spinning. The Academy voted one of the worst films ever made, ""Best Picture."" You heard me right, ""Crash"" is one of the worst films ever made. No, ""Crash"" isn't bad in the way of ""Plan Nine from Outer Space."" ""Crash"" is bad because it thinks it is so good and that its message is so important that it bears repeating over and over and over again until everyone gets it. But what is the message of ""Crash?"" There seems to be some confusion about this aspect of the film which I will clear up for you. In its simplest form, the message of ""Crash"" is, people can be categorized into racial stereotypes and it is understandable that we are prejudiced towards them. For example, the film shows us that all young black men are carjackers and criminals and it is perfectly justified for white women to fear them. All Asians, but especially Asian women, are bad drivers and talk funny. Another example is that all white cops are prejudiced against blacks. Even white cops that appear to be good on the outside are all racists. When the least bit frustrated white cops will molest black women instead of kicking the dog, and white cops will shoot young black men in the blink of an eye for simply reaching in their pocket. Rich, white women all hate Hispanics and treat their Hispanic maids like dirt. Black women are all drug addicts on welfare or have funny names. Okay, maybe that's only one of the messages of the film. I guess another message of ""Crash"" is that everyone is prejudiced towards some race and that includes the writer, director, and producer. Well, to be fair, the writers (Haggis and Moresco, director (Haggis), and the many producers are just prejudiced toward blacks, Asians, and Persians; they have no problem with Hispanics. Hispanics are the only good people in the film and have no prejudices. Oh, I forgot! Hispanics are prejudiced against bad driving, funny talking Asian women. Another ""Crash"" message is that, if you're having a bad day, if you're father is having health problems, of course you're going to be a racist. After all, isn't everyone? I know you're confused now because you and so many others were tricked by the film into believing that it was against racism. Don't feel bad because the writers and director of ""Crash"" use every trick in the book to manipulate you into thinking that, because they had some noble cause for making the film it is appropriate to use racial stereotypes. After all, the Academy had no problem with it so why should you.",2006
1,"I just watched Crash. This movie was way over the top and let me know almost right away it was not deserving of best picture. I was engladdened at first because it seemed like it might be another Magnolia type movie, but in the end the only comparison to Magnolia was the neat hippie music and the lack of resolution in many (try every one) of the story lines. Racism was a central theme, but as it pertained to this story it was a seemingly desultory, random element that was artificially injected at random points. The racism was extremely unnatural and forced and out of place in many instances. The result was that the movie came across not as being edgy and truthful like people are pretending this movie is, but rather ignorant and contrived at best. For example, the crack by Cheadle about ""all those cultures getting together and deciding to park their cars on their lawns"" was from left field and artificially inflammatory coming from a character who previously and thereafter gave us no racist indicators at all. There were no clues up to that point or after that he was racist or capable of such a statement (it was out of place in the conversation too), and the line had no place in his character or in the movie. And no, saying ""everyone is racist and that's why he said it"" is not true and not acceptable. The line was out of character, out of place, and therefore without taste. Some of the stories were good, but only up until race was artificially inseminated all over the screen. Additionally the whole movie was highly predictable. The scenes with the shopkeeper, the gun, the dead kid at the beginning of the movie, etc. - all predicted easily by me (and if I can predict events in a movie that is not a good thing at all). The clincher though that was the bizarre late night country music ""I feel like picking up a random black youth in an apparent act of kindness and then ignorantly and confrontationally stereotyping him to his face even though it is out of my character and it was in fact my partner who was the racist one, not me"" scene with Ryan Pillippie's character (who also presented no pre or post incident racist tendencies). What the heck was that? That should have been a deleted scene. On top of all this, the movie needed another 30 minutes at least to at least bring one or two more stories to conclusion. The Phillippe thing and the Cheadle Latino crack really bothered me the most though. I mean, I could buy the Sandra Bullock snooty rich white lady thing, but the rest was way too much. I think the fact that someone wrote a movie that says all people are racist says quite a lot about the writers and all the people involved, but says nothing about society as the movie had no realism whatsoever. The movie was almost complete in it's failure, but for Hollywood to admit that would mean so much more than just pretending it makes some kind of awe-inspiring statement about race. I hate to tell them and all of Hollywood that hailed this movie, but this has already been done and with more success (although still flawed) in the movie Grand Canyon. It is a far superior movie with race as the central theme. It was challenging and in your face and honest in the way Crash wishes it was, but with an inferior cast and far far less hype. If Hollywood really wanted to embrace racism being pushed to the forefront and being examined, then Bamboozled would have won best picture the year it came out (or at least been nominated).",2006
1,I wrote this as a two part review. Part two has spoilers.,2006
1,"I saw this ""movie"" partly because of the sheer number of good reviews at Netflix, and from it I leaned a valuable lesson. Not a lesson about ethnic diversity however...the lesson I learned is ""Don't trust reviews"".",2005
10,"There is good and bad in all of us. This movie explores this like no other. It will make you think about the nature of bigotry and stereotypes. The characters switch from heavy to hero in a way that is deeply moving and exhilarating. It is TV drama style writing where several different groups of characters and plots interweave (Paul Haggis) but with none of the limits of TV, it reminded me of ""Hill Street Blues"" which from me is a big compliment. I am a Don Cheadle fan and he captures the role. Sandra Bullock plays against character and pulls it off with ease. The most impressive performance to me was Ryan Phillippe's. Almost every nationality in LA was represented and they all were interesting and realistic. The ensemble cast and various plots blend together and keep your interest. Cast is great, music is haunting, writing is superb. Go see this movie.",2005
1,"Well, my friends, I finally got up the gumption to see ""Crash"" this week so I could decide for myself. I really did want to believe that it had best picture quality. And putting it succinctly, it was a revelation. And the revelation was how to make a totally unbelievable set of circumstances such that it leaves the audience no opportunity to interpret anything at all. The film started about 7:50 and by 9 I was practically shouting at the screen, ""Are we supposed to be taking this seriously?"" GIVE ME A BREAK! Then when the scene where the Iranian man fired the gun at the locksmith, I just completely lost it. I told my partner very forcefully, ""I'm leaving."" He pleaded for me not to, that it was almost over. I repeated, ""I'm leaving,"" and I marched out of the theater, threw my leftover popcorn and soda into the garbage (where I believe the film should be thrown), sat down in the lobby and cried for five minutes with my face in my hands, I was SO upset. How any thinking person could have selected that piece of garbage for a Best Picture Oscar -- completely unbelievable situations, contrived and manipulative dialog, amateurish camera work not even good enough for an SVU episode, and the feeling that I had been repeatedly bashed over the head with hate by means of a sledgehammer? I don't have time for that kind of anti-artistic expression in the remaining years of my life. I might also point out that of the 70 some odd speaking roles in the film, there was not a single gay character portrayed. Talk about unrealistic for the city of Los Angeles! The only thing that could have improved the film would have been a top-flight director and not the writer. Let me compare ""Crash"" to the 2003 British film ""Love Actually,"" which also has multiple diverse plot lines coming together at the end. LA accomplished its purpose SO much better than did ""Crash,"" but I will be forever calling ""Crash"" by the name it truly deserves, ""Hate Actually."" I might add that this was only the 2nd time in my life that I have actually walked out of a movie because I was so upset. I absolutely refuse to be repeatedly hammered and be told constantly what I'm supposed to be feeling. I will not be manipulated. Be forewarned.",2006
1,"I agree with what so many others have said about the shallow and offensive nature of this film's examination of racism. It is baffling to me that so many people seem to have been fooled by its pretentiousness. I want to comment on the Matt Dillon character as an example of what's most infuriating about this movie. Here we have a man who -- contrasted with the film's underlying message that ""we're all a LITTLE racist"" -- effectively rapes a woman in public, cruelly humiliating her husband and deliberately goading him to make a move that, as he well knows, will lead to his arrest or even death. He does all this after pulling the couple over without any legal cause but because, as we come to understand, they are black and wealthy and he is a hurt little boy who is now the police and can therefore do as he pleases. This behavior is not a LITTLE racist. This behavior is evil. It is disturbing to me that this extreme of racism is held up next to another character's behavior -- spouting her paranoid stereotypes about gang violence -- to illustrate that everybody's a LITTLE racist. Later, we're spoon-fed some tripe about Dillon's poor old dad and how black folks drove him into the poor house. Is this supposed to explain, or worse, excuse this behavior? And is Dillon's character meant to redeem himself by committing the utterly unmotivated and unbelievable, laughably coincidental act of saving the woman he sexually assaulted the very night before? Please. The fact that so many people seem to feel some kind of self-congratulatory admiration for this film makes me feel sad about the shallowness of our understanding of racism, and our apparent lack of commitment to condemning and ending it.",2005
1,"I get the impression that I was watching a different movie to the majority of other people I know who have seen this film. It's not really that I found the film offensive or anything - just that the script was unbelievably amateurish for a film that had obviously had a bit of money thrown at it. I really respected Paul Haggis' work on the Million Dollar Baby script and was bitterly disappointed to see how bad this script was. It was clear to me that it was desperate to be the 'racism' version of Traffic, but I don't think Traffic was really a film worth ripping off in the first place. ",2005
1,And I mean to say it's about a fantasy world. I've never been to LA but I can't believe a major metropolis like the one in this movie exists in this universe or even in an evil parallel universe.

And once you begin to look at this movie sideways the whole thing becomes funny.,2006

My hat to Clint Eastwood. What an extraordinary career. An artist of enormous proportions so well camouflaged behind a shy smile and a charming, clumsy attitude. I remember focusing on Clint Eastwood through a very different lens after sitting through ""Pale Rider"" a mythological, lyrical western. Actors love him because he, clearly, doesn't lie to them, doesn't kiss their asses. He quite simply gives them room to maneuver. Even someone like Meryl Streep, felt freer and capable to stretch herself all the way to Italy under his wing. Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon, Tim Robbins, Jude Law, Morgan Freeman, Gene Hackman yes mostly men but there was also, other than Meryl Streep, Genevieve Boujold. Marcia Gay Harden, Laura Linney and now Hillary Swank with a performance that not even ""Boys don't Cry"" could predict. The film is a triumph in every department. My stomach ached from feeling. That's a compliment Mr. Eastwood. Thank you very much.",2005
10,"Flawlessly written, acted and directed, MILLION DOLLAR BABY is being hymned and wreathed by the critics as the best film of 2004. They're absolutely right. ""An old master's new masterpiece,"" the NEW YORK TIMES said in a review that was more of an open love letter to Eastwood than anything remotely resembling a critical analysis of the film itself. For once such honey-tongued critical adulation is fully merited. Dark, edgy, subtle and at times emotionally devastating, MILLION DOLLAR BABY represents the apotheosis of Eastwood's art - the most lucid and intelligently limned expression of his philosophy of the outsider, the noble loners whose personal codes of honour set them both above and apart from the compromised, corrupt societies they inhabit. The Boxing Ring As Metaphor For Life is a hoary trope almost as old as Hollywood itself, employed to varying effect in films as diverse as THE CHAMP, GOLDEN BOY, REQUIEM FOR A HEAVYWEIGHT, THE GREAT WHITE HOPE, FAT CITY, ROCKY and RAGING BULL. In MILLION DOLLAR BABY, though, Eastwood the director brings a fresh eye and an entirely fresh approach to both the setting and characterisations, virtually re-inventing this venerable sub-genre rather than simply recycling its conventions. Eastwood the actor is in fine form - a commanding if increasingly weather-beaten presence - as gym owner Frankie Dunn. A case study in loneliness, Dunn's creased face is a map of places you'd rather not go to and disappointment has clearly been a life-long companion. Co-stars Hilary Swank and the magnificent Morgan Freeman, playing Frankie's unlikely protegee Maggie Fitzgerald and friend ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris, give what are without question the best performances of their respective careers: deftly underplayed, their roles provide emotionally overwhelming impacts more powerful than anything glimpsed in the film's riotous fight sequences. Forming an iron triangle forged from mutual dependence, Dunn and Dupris school the impulsive but untutored Maggie in both the techniques of boxing and the tradecraft of survival in a world pre-disposed to pulverise individualism. The canvas-floored square ring becomes the arena in which all three characters confront their various demons, battling for both victory and personal redemption. Paul Haggis' screenplay is itself a masterwork, improving on its source material without betraying the concise but compelling situations and superbly drawn characters found in F.X. Toole's short stories. And, finally, Eastwood the composer's elegiac but unobtrusive score is a minor classic of its kind, a requiem to both lost souls and lost causes. MILLION DOLLAR BABY is not only the best film released in 2004 it is also the most fully realised and richly textured major studio movie of the decade.",2004

Clint Eastwood is one heck of an actor and his directing of movies is even better. He is 75 years old and hope he has another 10 years of good movie making in him. Morgan Freeman is a great actor who never seems to receive the recognition he deserves. Tell others to see it because it isn't in the top 10 listing of viewed movies last week.

Morgan Freeman is great as a supporting actor and he definitely deserves some recognition for his performance. Clint Eastwood himself deserves an Oscar for his excellent directing and own spectacular performance. His role was perfect, creating a strong yet vulnerable character people will embrace.

3,"The main problems of 'Saw' are related to the tremendous script mistakes that only a uncritical spectator will just obviate. The main question is what's is the purpose of the killer in his lying in the middle of the floor? The film tries to show that the killer's aim is to cause evil and destruction in his victims, he loves to play with the lives of other people and to feel control over their the fears and debilities. So why does he just pretend to be dead between the two main characters? A tremendous unlikelihood: can a man pretend to be dead for more than one or two hours without moving a single muscle or even without breathing in order not to be discovered by two men who are in the same room? It has not sense at all except to be the final (d)effect of the movie. The killer seems to have always the control along the plot and if it's lying like a dead body this can't be possible. Finally, it doesn't work. The right place for the killer should have been a darker and untouchable shadow behind the false shadow (the male nurse) but not the floor of the white room. The director shouldn't have showed the killer's face and maybe the site where he is hidden. Then, the film would be a quite good thriller. However, 'Saw' is just a fiasco.

The acting was sub par to say the least. The actors who were well known (Glover, Potter, Elwes) gave possibly the poorest display of acting in each of their careers. Having Elwes in a serious role for one thing... I had to contain my giggles throughout most of the movie. In my head I kept envisioning him rolling down the side of a mountain screaming ""as you wishhhhhh..."" The unknown actors (Whannell for example) bothered me from the beginning with his strained and obviously forced fear. Also, the movie contained too many twists to follow. I myself am a big fan of subplots and twists, but it seemed that right around every corner was a new twinge in the story, connecting more of the characters together. It got to the point where you were tired of trying to figure out ""who done it"" and just wished it would be over and the good guys would win. Despite the harsh words, it is worth seeing if you have 4 dollars to blow at Blockbuster... and the stomach for extreme bloodshed.",2005
1,"There were so many things wrong with this movie i have trouble keeping them all straight. But one thing that really bothers me is that if Jigsaw was the one laying on the ground in the bathroom, what happens if Zep never shows up? What if Zep was killed by Danny Gloover before he made it to the bathroom? Does Jigsaw simply just get up and walk out? Could the guy in the middle of the bathroom not be jigsaw, but another part of Jigsaw's game? What if Zep killed the wife and kid, how does Jigsaw get him the antidote for the poison if he's lying in the middle of the bathroom? Why does the doctor wait till the last minute to finally cut off his foot? It was too late, it was after six and as far as he knew his wife and child were already shot dead, it wasn't the best time for heroics. These are just a few questions i had about the film, but i may be missing something or everything as i have only seen the movie once. Please Help!",2005
2,"So I just watched this movie (I won't even make the effort to use the obvious pun here), and I am scared. Scared of bad acting, bad editing, poor plot. Two guys wake up in a shitty bathroom, tied to opposite corners by chains, nothing on them but their clothes and some tools they might need to survive, but haven't figured out how to use yet. In the beginning, I instantly thought of a CUBE-like setup, and was really looking forward to seeing it. But, as the story evolved more and more, I realised there was not much to it. A big chunk of this movie is told in flashbacks, to somehow ""justify"" why the two guys ended up there, how they are connected, and why the killer is acting the way he is (although, in the long run, I still can't quite explain why you have to kill people to show them how cool life is. Or why it makes you that insane and brilliant at the same time so that you have nothing better to do than set up strange traps that make people kill themselves, or why you start to enjoy watching your masterpiece of psychological torture-cabinet lying on the bathroom floor with your eyes closed, pretending to be dead. Ah, right, for the *surprise* ending. I forgot.) Everything is thought-out halfway, but that's where it ends. I mean, the story has potential, it could've made a really great movie, but they just ruined it to give them a platform to show off. ""Huh, yeah, see what I can do. I can use speed-up pictures and ultra-shaky camera. I bet you never saw this before, right?"" Right, right. Never. So, the standard tools to make a movie look young and fresh, again. What else do we need for a nice horror/slasher movie? Right, cliché! Lots of it. And the main thing that really makes me mad is this ""Stupid Victim"" Syndrome. ""Hmmm. This guy just wanted to kill me, but now I have the gun...what should I do? Yeah, talk to my husband on the phone instead of shooting him (at least in the legs)."" Seriously, this scares the hell out of me. Can't ANYBODY please write a script that has ""normal-acting"" victims in it? Like, shooting the guy? Sorry, but this was a quite boring movie with bad acting and a poor script (though the idea was great). Yeah, poor. That sums it up quite well.",2005
4,I have to give this movie a 4 because of a couple of things.,2005
1,"This movie is a poor attempt of an ""intellectual"" horror movie. I was shocked to later learn that the movie had received box office acclaim and a 7.5 rating in IMDb. Don't know which ones worst the plot or the intelligence of most people who thought this movie was great. It looked as though the writer was up late one night watching an episode of Survivor(while flipping channels to MTV where Nine Inch Nails were playing) and subconsciously thought to himself ""What if the challenges were sadistic, I could turn it in to a horror movie"". Clearly didn't pay attention to the storyline as it was littered with loose plots. Completely pretentious and a time waster.",2005
1,This was the most unrealistic movie I ever seen.,2005
1,"(This review does not necessarily expose the plot of the movie, however it may change one's expectations of the movie and thus make for a less enjoyable experience.) ",2005
9,"The love/hate reactions I've seen do not surprise me at all. This movie is very different, it's own style... and it is PURE GENIUS. But it's definitely not for everyone... you have to back off and understand the mood and general feel of the movie before you have the context to find the actions of the characters funny. Then you will ""get it"". And what is this context I'm referring to? This movie explores the very essence of boredom and mediocrity as you follow the daily life of a dorky guy doing uninteresting things in a small, unexciting town. Napolean's constant, open-mouth, blank stare says, ""I'm only tolerating this monotonous existence because I've got nothing better to do."" It took me about 15 minutes into the movie and then I GOT it. The movie has no real plot because it isn't about an interesting story, it's about the real life that exists BETWEEN the interesting stories. Ever call up your bud because you're bored, then talk about what you're not doing, then decide to get together and be bored together, and spend the remainder of the evening trying to think of something to do to no avail? This movie is about this very type of thing... a tribute to the ordinary every-day stuff that you have no reason or desire to remember... like eating reheated leftover Hamburger Helper, or that old shirt you wear when you're working that you're not afraid to get dirty, or some magazine you flipped through to pass the time in the dentist's waiting room.",2004
7,"Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder) is the typical sad-sack, luckless loser that has permeated high schools for seemingly centuries. He has no friends, he's picked on by bullies, he has a somewhat-odd home life ... but through it all, he's sure things will be just plain okay in the end.",2004
10,"If you like dry or dark humor, you should get a big kick out of this movie. I know I did. If you are between 12-20 you might even like it more because this deals with high school kids primarily. However, there are some adults in here who play key roles, too.",2007
10,"This movie is quite possibly the funniest movie ever. It doesn't have much of a storyline, but in this case, it doesn't matter. I keep reading reviews that say it isn't believable. Anyone who has attended High School in the last 10 years knows that this movie portrays exactly what it is like. Who doesn't know someone exactly like Napoleon? Or Pedro? Or Summer? Or Deb? Or Don? There are Napoleons, Pedros, Summers, Debs, and Dons in EVERY American High School. One of the funniest parts about this movie is that it IS so accurate. And who hasn't run across an internet geek like Kip? This movie is filled with jokes about our culture today. I haven't met one person yet who has seen it and not liked it. Talk about a cult classic in the making. The film uses witty humor, and a little goofy humor. It's the PERFECT film for light comedy. If you're into those kind of films that make you think a lot, this one definitely isn't for you. On the other hand, if you laugh at things like Napoleon getting psyched for a milk-testing contest, or lying about hunting wolverines in Alaska, exaggerating about his bow staff skills or his brother bragging about chatting online with ""babes"" all day, you can't go wrong. (10/10)",2005
10,"Though this movie seems to strike a chord with the younger crowd, there is no age limit to appreciating this film, just limits in your sense of humor. Perhaps the funniest movie I've seen in years, ND explores character profiles we never thought would make it to the movies. The characters cover a wide range of social misfits and exhibit the nuances of their behavior in a way that makes sense to them, if not to the general public. It's like a sociological case study of a primitive and exotic tribe of ""Nerds"". Everyone of us should be able to recognize at least one of the ND characters from somewhere in our past or somewhere in our psyches. The acting is sublime, because sometimes we forget that they ARE acting. The writing and dialogue are inventive and unexpected, and so dry it might take you a few days to start laughing. But once you do start laughing, you won't be able to stop. This movie is sure to be a cult classic for the new millennium the way Repo Man was the the 80's. And if you like this film, consider yourself luck-EEEE, because not everyone will.",2005
10,"I saw this movie in theaters when it first came out and was quite curious because of the hype surrounding it at the time. When I walked out, all I could hear myself saying in my mind was ""What the hell just happened?"" and felt like going back to the box office and asking for my 10 bucks back.",2006
10,"When discussing over-rated movies, this movie is mentioned pretty often. Most criticism I've heard stems from the movies hype as ""indie classic"" and the annoying fan base. I agree, some what. Comparing it to Juno and the likes does the movie a disservice, as did the great number of people spouting lines like ""vote for Pedro"" and ""Tina eat the ham"". ",2011
10,"First of all, I thought Napolean Dynamite was one of the weirdest, funniest films I've seen in years. Interestingly, I liked it better the second time around. But the film is not for everyone; my wife couldn't stand the film, and we have incredibly similar taste in movies (and books).",2006
8,This film is a refreshing look at a typical geek in a forgotten part of the country. Jared Hess is to be commended by bringing this dead pan comedy to the screen.,2004
10,"This is by far one of the best movies I have ever seen. I had to drive 2 hours and pay $10 just to see it, but it was all worth it. The material in this movie was fresh, creative, original, and kept you laughing the whole time. You won't find another movie quite like it.",2004
1,"This movie has become idolized on my college campus, and basically every other one across the country. You simply do not understand half the jokes people say unless you see the movie. I was shocked to find that the first time I watched it I already knew most of the lines just from hearing them being recited by my friends. So, I watched the movie expecting to be entertained. No. I've heard that if you're under 30 you will love this movie. Well, I'm 18 and hated it. I know that it's not a movie driven on plot or any sort of character depth, and that it's supposed to just be about humor. But ND wasn't in ANY WAY funny. The only point of my watching it is to now understand posters around campus and things people say. Other than that, it was a waste of time. Seriously... it's just awful. If you don't like stupid humor then ND is not for you. It goes beyond stupid humor even.... it's just stupid.",2005
1,"I ""get"" and enjoy offbeat humor, Wes Anderson's stuff, etc. How anyone could make a case for this movie being an example of that is far beyond my comprehension. I found this movie to be the worst I've ever seen, higher, actually, than Gigli, and I ""get"" the jokes, but I just thought they were terrible. I have a great sense of humor, and while I wasn't a ""nerd"" in high school, I can appreciate most humor. This wasn't funny. This was pointless. This was the cinematic equivalent of excrement. There is not a chance in hell that I will ever watch this again, in fact, I hope to never speak of it again. I just feel that as a public servant, I need to tell you how absolutely horrendous Napoleon Dynamite is.",2004
1,"While I'm sure many are genuinely interested in and love the film, it's just not that great. I think one of the main reasons for the hype is the over-exaggerated emphasis on nonconformity among teens in the US. Since it's an indie, and it's completely different than all the other films and breaks away from all those ""GOD-AWFUL"" typical films, it has to be great, right? Wrong. Quote from IMDb user who loved the film: ""This movie explores the very essence of boredom and mediocrity as you follow the daily life of a dorky guy doing uninteresting things in a small, unexciting town. Napolean's constant, open-mouth, blank stare says, ""I'm only tolerating this monotonous existence because I've got nothing better to do."""" That sums the film up quite well; however, after saying that, one wonders why someone would still watch the film. Shite. People think that anything 'different' must be awesome, but my goal in life isn't to pay to see some guy 'doing uninteresting things' throughout his 'monotonous existence' because '{he's} got nothing better to do.] I can bore myself to death without any help, thank you!",2005
1,"This movie was so boring and meaningless that I almost feel asleep during it and I wasn't even tired. I kept waiting for something funny to happen and it never did. Did the guy in the field shoot himself or the cow when the kids on the school bus all screamed? I kept trying to look for hidden meanings or dark humor and could not find any. The best part was seeing Kipp in clothing like some rapper homeboy, other than that the movie was a complete waste of my time.",2005
1,"I watched this movie with high expectations, everyone i know has said that this movie was a classic comedy such as ""Zoolander"" and most movies featuring the ""Frat Pack"". So i borrowed it from a friend and prepared myself for a great comedy, i was seriously disappointed. The movie was slow, boring, and the parts that were supposed to be funny were clearly not. Line such as ""Gosh"" and ""Freakin Idiot"" which most people found utterly hilarious only made me raise my eyebrows and shake my head. It wasn't witty or well written, but it wasn't slapstick either, in fact it is the poorest excuse for a comedy i've ever seen. Things such as ""Vote for Pedro"" which everyone seems to have on their shirts these days were just not funny at all, in fact everything about Pedro was just lame. It seems that the movie is set around the eighties or early nineties because of the terrible fashion sense and music used. But uncle Ricco is always going on about the eighties hinting that it is set more towards modern times, how does that explain the retro fashion used be EVERYONE! I can't see how so many people love this movie and how it comes so highly recommend but it does so i guess it really is a matter of opinion, but still come on this was just bad, if you want to see a decent movie try looking in the COMEDY section.",2006
1,"This movie annoyed me till no end. When I originally saw it I was like "" okay, whatever"". But when I started hearing everyone and there mother quote this movie it started to bug me. Then when I saw people buy shirts that said ""vote for Pedro"" that's when my hated for this movie began. Please someone tell me what is so funny about this movie? You have a nerd that's in high school and he has a little friend named Pedro. His brother is another nerd that wants to be a cage fighter and his uncle is a scum bag. This should have been a made for TV movie. But with kids now-a-days with no taste you can put what ever sewage you want on the big screen and every teenage will eat it up like it was a lobster dinner. Bottom line... this movie sucks",2007
1,"I quite possibly cannot find words to describe the intensity with which I loathe this Napoleon Dynamite. I saw it in theatres with my friend, and we walked out of the theatre wanting the last 88 minutes of our lives back. We have now determined that the best part of the movie was knowing that it would end eventually. After hearing it was better the second time around, I watched again with a few friends at a New Years' party. I took that time exchanging bored and annoyed looks with the only person in the room who felt the same way.",2005

What followed was fifteen minutes of sitting there, amazed that I had wasted so much of my precious young life. The characters are barely 2-dimensional, boring, whiny, and lacking in any sort of an ironic undertone that would normally make this kind of movie funny, or at least watchable. The events are simply not funny, and not connected with any sort of either empathy with the main character or hatred for him; Just... nothingness. Do yourself a favor and pass on this one.",2004

They do not stop them as quickly as they'd like, however, and the U.S. troops soon discover that a bizarre infant, part devil, part man, red, with horns and the demonic works, with a large right hand made of indestructible stone, has gotten through.

7,"Let's be blunt, the movie is, in essence, a little lumbering and flawed and has a rather odd climax. The beginning is overlong and vaguely too fantastical, but once you realize this is a very different world, a comic book really, and normal rules don't apply, it can be forgiven. In fact most of the flaws can be forgiven because of Ron Perlman and what he brought to the picture.",2004
7,"Alright, so seeing as how I'm comment #430, I don't imagine that anyone is going to read my review, or that anyone will be encouraged to watch Hellboy because of anything that I'll say.

7,"When you are watching a comic book movie you have to take certain things for granted. The superpowers, strange villains, things like that. They are there in a non-existing world; saying they are implausible is true but not relevant. What a comic book movie needs is a nice story that is set in its own world (although real existing places can be there too), an entertaining superhero played by an actor who is able to really create the character, spectacular visual effects that fit the action but most of all it needs to breath the right mood. 'Spider-Man 2' did a perfect job, 'X2', 'Blade II' and now 'Hellboy' come very close. The difference is that 'Hellboy' is the first from what will probably become a series.",2004
9,"Someone told me a long time ago that ""Van Helsing"" and ""Hellboy"" were in the same level of quality, saying they ""both sucked"". Well, that's a filthy lie. What you have here is a movie (based on a popular comic book of the same name) that does EVERYTHING that it seems ""Van Helsing"" slipped on. Don't get me wrong; I liked ""Van Helsing"", but let's face it, it wasn't the best movie ever and it lacked a lot of character development and an ending that was a bit of a cliffhanger (because you never find out what Van Helsing's past is), but ""Hellboy"" is another story.",2007
8,Hellboy is a well-balanced and very well-paced movie that avoids tiresome action movie content (mostly).,2004
8,"Hellboy is self-conscious, perhaps, but in the best ways possible. Actually, it's more due to writer/director Toro being very aware of what makes up the conventional bits to every sense character-wise to the world of a comic-book, but also what can be entertaining as well, than it is just to having it being a Hellboy movie where the comic-book Hellboy already exists IN this world (guy sees the Hellboy comic, looks up, it's Hellboy!). We get the tough-as-nails, dryly witty, and possibly ticking-time-bomb hero in Hellboy, a deadly serious villain in Rasputin (yes, Rasputin, with a blonde Nazi as his evil side-kick no less), the young apprentice to the hero (Ruper Evans as John Meyers), the hero's love interest (Liz Sherman played by Selma Blair), the father figure (John Hurt's Professor), and the reluctant 'boss' (Jeffrey Tambor), not to mention the plucky side mutant in Abraham (Doug Jones) AND a magnificent creature in that hard-ass slug. They're all there, bright as day (or dark, depending on point of view), and it all works wonderfully due to Toro running with it all head on. It's not done in a way that's meant to pander to the audience, either, but just to have fun with the conventions, to see what makes them all crackle and pop under big-time special effects. It's not quite a guilty pleasure because Toro is also a smart craftsman.",2007
9,"I must say I would have never expected in my wildest dreams to enjoy a film like this so much, much less this one.  Hellboy has it's faults but it's truly comic book/horror/fantasy hybrid masterpiece. It is the probably the best comic book movie I've ever seen. Based on a little known comic book I'm sure people will be running to buy now. Hellboy is the story of a group of bad guys whom are trying to destroy the world and end up bringing forth a small child like hellboy. After years of being raised by his founder he becomes a superhero monster fighting bad guys like himself and bringing them to justice while defending humanity. He's helped along in his quest by pyro girl Liz Sherman played beautifully by Selma Blair. And a very cool intellectual fish Looking guy referred to as Blue. But those people are back to destroy the world again as they have ressurected their master and it's up to Hellboy and his gang of misfits to protect humanity and foil their plan. I'm sure it sounds surely predicatble but that something this film lacks in troves. It's completely original, completely new and just great. The performances by Ron Pearlman, John Hurt and Selma Blair are completely involving. The story is well developed, emotional, scary and funny. The direction is taut and well developed. Definatly Del Toro's reigning masterpiece. I must say I was overly impressed by this film probably because I wasn't expecting too much but I can guarantee you one thing I will be going to see it again. Hellboy is amazing!",2004

Sixty years later, those who birthed Hellboy are back for him and the end of the world.",2005
8,"This movie is a fun watch, but mainly because of Ron Perlman. The action is well done and the story is great, but Perlman makes the character of Hellboy (a demon raised by ""the good guys"") just amazingly human, with a wry sense of humor. You would be hard pressed to find anyone anywhere who could do this character as well as Perlman, let alone better. The physicality seems to have been tailor made to fit Perlman's features and the delivery of the lines is just so understatedly comedic that there are few who could pull it off at all.",2008
1,"A lot of the movie kept throwing new ideas and twists in but nothing was developed.  Characters had extremely small roles.  John Myers was hardly developed and yet played a crucial role in the end??  His credability was not brought out enough.  And the powers of Rasputin were not really shown, he just kind of did everything he did with no real motivation.  Characters were just kind of left out?",2004

I wasn't all that fussed when this film came out at the cinemas so after 5 years of not being bothered and someone i know hounding me to watch it, i decided to go against my better judgement and borrow it. Terrible mistake. In all fairness the opening to the film was good and i thought to myself 'i may have been wrong' but it was all downhill from there. We're just thrown right into the middle of a story. Nothing is explained about the relationship between Hellboy and Liz, or at least it isn't explained very well. There was a pointless thing between Liz and Myers (seriously what was the point of it?) and finally whats with the fish thing?",2009

4,"Hellboy revolves around classic comic book/action/superhero genre story lines. Essentially Hellboy is a kind of demon who has found his way on earth.

I went in without hearing anything about it, knowing nothing of where hell boy came from, and hoped that I could lend an unprejudiced view.  Right from the start, the movie begins throwing characters, important concepts, and bizarre events at you. Thinking that most of these things will be explained, you wait....and wait. The truth is, no explanation ever comes.  You never really even figure out what Hell boy is or who he is.  This goes for most every character in the movie.  All of them are developed only enough to loosely connect the plot, which suffers from the same development issues.  I'm not an idiot who can't things out on my own, the others who went with me also had fifty questions, and we all had different answers when we walked out.  The acting is not good, but it is bearable, and only hurts the film in a few places, thankfully. Basically, you're going to spend a lot of time trying to figure out what's going on and who everyone is, and you'll have lots of time to ponder since this movie is mostly just a few long, drug-out action sequences anway. Save your money, folks.",2004
1,"The title says it all.  How anyone could like this garbage is beyond me. The movie took forever to pick up pace.  It had too much talk and not enough action.  Hellboy looked like he was wrapped in foam painted over with cheap red fingernail polish.  Abe Sapien looked even cheesier, and Liz Sherman looked like a junkie instead of the love interest.  The special effects were below average quality.  The villains were a waste of screen time since they didn't even convey enough character for the audience to even dislike them.",2004
9,"It's hard to be a freak, even when you have been brought to life by Rasputin, Hitler and a few other crazy humans. But even Satan can fall in love with another freak of his type and even Satan can be attached to the catholic professor who became his father, the one who provided him with candy and sweets, because Satan has a sweet tooth. Satan somewhere is slightly human and a tiny bit catholic. A cross may burn his palm but when it has been served to him for sixty years by a benevolent old man who he considers his father he may start to like it, to love him and then to hate those who are on the other side. Don't expect any kind of deep emotional feelings though but expect some beautiful special effects that look so realistic that they will make you thrill and shiver. And what's more they will be exotic and lead you to rainy New York City and snowy Moscow and underground everywhere, in the NYC subway or in some Russian cemetery. You will meet with dead people who are revived and then can lead you to the very center of hell, or with surgical fetishists who have recomposed their bodies bone by bone and muscle by muscle. But the most attractive element is in the use of fire, the fascination with fire and that has to do with the constant reference to the apocalypse, that of the Book of Revelation of course? Fire seen as the ultimate cleansing element that can bring the universe to its end or destroy up all evil from earth. The ambivalence of this fire is fairly surprising in many ways since most people are afraid of fire and here it is the ultimate redeeming element. It is true when you are surrounded by meters of snow and tons of ice you are grateful for one little small fire in the living room hearth. And be satisfied: the FBI director who is in charge will end up locked up underground to die peacefully, at least deep enough for no one to be pestered by his protest and yelling.",2008

Del Toro doesn't capture the shadowiness and the Gothic art of the books, but does the get the heart of the material, and plays it well between lighthearted comedy, lighthearted action, and as much weirdness(talking corpses, psychic merman, pyroknesis, Rasputin, clockwork Nazi assassins, and Cthulu, to name a few of the flourishes), as the story can handle.",2008

I've never read comics as I don't like them, but I'd go so far as to say, apart from Batman, this is the best comic book to movie tie in ages... not cheesy, just the right amount of comedy in it and good solid acting. Music could've done with a alittle more inspriation, but this film looks great with some lovely lit scenes especially when hellboy is in the snow, he looks fanastic ;-)",2007

Denzel Washington plays one of his most engaging and emotional roles to date, and the rest of the cast perform beautifully. Christopher Walken is of course superb in his part although he did not appear as often as I would have liked. A story of ultimate greed that backfires is offset against a childs innocence and love. This is also a film for action movie lovers as it has its fair share of bullets, rockets and revenge. The location of Mexico City adds a feel of seediness and corruption which in itself is an eye opener. All in all, a truly gripping film from beginning to end. Highly recommended!",2005

10,"...dont read any plot summaries because in words the plot might seem trivial, brain-dead and pointless. The film is excellent, the acting by both Denzel and Dakota (she will go sky high, trust me on that)are just fabulous, and the plot is mind blowing. Actually ""fabulous"" is a small word to use for such talented actors. The film is just based on actual facts and some characters are not fictional, a fact that adds up to the shock that i was having during and after the film. If you are fond of both actors and of somewhat deranged films, you still haven't watched your favorite one yet...Trust me, in the end you will have a weird and inexplicable feeling. The film is awesome, see it, rent it, buy it or whatever...just don't miss it",2005
10,"I loved this movie. I'm a Mexican and was in the least offended by it. In fact, I think this movie should be shown at police headquarters all over Mexico. It's a sad truth that our police system is as rotten as a 3 month old corpse. It angers me to read in the news how killers, kidnappers and other slime go free by paying a laughable fine or live like kings inside prison cells. We should have someone like Creasy, Denzel Washington's character. A bodyguard turned vengeful vigilante. Kidnapping is flourishing industry down here (at least in the big cities). I actually wish real life kidnappers could suffer the same fate as the one's Creasy did his fine job upon. That would be so marvelous (Sorry, I am THAT resentful!). MAN ON FIRE is a gripping film that you can't miss. It might be hard on some of you, if you aren't used to reading subtitles (Mexicans do that ALL the time while watching American movies) but the effort will be well worth it. Some of the editing is a bit fuzzy...kind of like TRAFFIC, remember? (another brilliant take on how corrupt Mexico is). The movie starts out a bit slow but the pace picks up frantically by the second half. I swear you'll be cheering as you watch Denzel Washington dispatch the wrong doers. His performance is nothing short of Excellent. The ending (no spoilers, OK!!!) is a bit sad, but I'm sure you'll like it anyway. MAN ON FIRE is one of the year's best movies. A ""must own"" for a DVD collection! 9* out of 10",2004

Dakota Fanning is  rapidly becoming a staple in movie that require a child with an old  soul personality and she has never disappointed me with her talent.

8,"This is one film which i was really excited about and believe me it did not disappoint. Denzel Washington is on great form as usual. his portrayal of Creasy a very distraught man is maybe not enough to be considered for an Oscar, but it is still up there with his best work. the storyline is fantastic and the stock which Scott chooses to use really gives one a sense of that sweaty, gritty and corrupt atmosphere of Mexico. For some the beginning of the film may drag on for a bit too long, however it is essential in establishing Creasy's character. The action really starts when Cristopher Walkens, who by the way is brilliant in his supporting role says Creasy's about to paint his masterpiece. one by one the culprits meet in their end in ways which even the most spontaneous and inventive killer would not even dream about. A brilliant film with a touch of class form both Washington and Scott.",2005
6,"A riveting introduction, powerful performances and yet, I couldn't quite connect. The trendy editing, I hope, it's just a moronic phase that movies are going through to be outgrow soon, very soon. All the dramatic tension vanishes as the editor plays around with the visuals. Why? If you have characters played by the likes of Denzel Washington, why the need to hit us over the head with a self conscious blow of irrational cutting taking me out of the movie completely and forcing me to see the movie as a movie, the actors as actors and the drama as sheer fiction. Washington is superb. Slowly but surely I'm warming up to the man. I've always admired his performances but there was something about the actor, a veil of arrogance perhaps, that stopped me from getting closer. Here, his personal torment and his warming up to Dakota Fanning took me completely until the smart ass editing ruined everything.",2006
7,"You know you're in for something different when a movie has Christopher Walken playing the part of a professional hit man - and he isn't even one of the bad guys! Although it could do with some judicious trimming here and there, ""Man on Fire"" is a generally effective crime drama that ranges in tone from the openly sentimental to the downright brutal - and just about every tone imaginable in between.",2005
6,"A guilt ridden, Bible reading, alcoholic ex-counter insurgency assassin, Creasy (Washington), takes a job as body guard for a little girl (Fanning) in Mexico only to see her snatched from under his nose by a Mexican crime cartel. Predictably, Washington then goes on a one man mission of revenge with a promise to ""off"" anyone who profited from the girl's murder. According to his compadre (Walken), he's an artist, his art is death, and he's about to paint his masterpiece. ""Man on Fire"", which fared much better with the public than the critics, is a run-of-the-mill action/drama which fills up its almost 2.5 hour run with lots of concocted drama, super macho action, and annoying visual effects which do more to detract than embellish. Washington isn't the usual sweaty, muscular Schwarzenegger or Stallone one man army and subtitles which jump around on screen changing fonts and zipping form the mouths speaking the Spanish don't help. Nonetheless, ""Man on Fire"" will be worth a DVD rental for Denzel fans and should make for an enjoyable no brainer small screen watch. (B-)",2004
10,"Revenge is a word most of us are all-too familiar with. Rarely do I comment on movies, but today -- as I compose this message at 2:30AM -- I feel compelled to do so. Judging the proverbial book by its cover, one might suspect ""Man On Fire"" is a movie based solely on personal revenge. This particular movie, however, is a far-cry from such. Throughout the movie, there is much more to learn (or, for some of us, to be reminded of): 100% selfless acts of kindness, acts of pure love. Once you check out this movie, you'll surely realize the devotion that the main character (played by Denzel Washington) has for his young companion. Regardless of pain or suffering, and without personal gain, ""Creasy"" takes on battles with enemies, once-friends, and even himself in order to not let the death of his friend lie in vain.",2005
5,I was very eager to see this one when I read the synopsis and knew who was involved. After making Revenge and True Romance Tony Scott became one of my favorite directors of the 90's. Add Denzel Washington and Christopher Walken with a hard boiled script by Brian Helgeland and you think you've got a masterpiece on your hands.,2005

4,"The thing viewers will remember most is the bad headache the movie has given them due to the overly flashy, shaky, camera-work and the fast, confusing cutting. I am not against those kind of stylistic devices if they are done right like Oliver Stone and Steven Soderbergh proof with most of their movies, but in this case there was WAY too much. It seems like the jump-cuts and light flashes that accompanied every flight over Mexico city and every important scene were there to distract you from realizing that the story is quite thin and the whole thing was very predictable. The biggest disappointment lies in the fact that you can easily figure out how the whole thing is going to end. For a movie that pretends to be violent, ruthless and morally corrupt it is inexcusable that it's story has been told so many times and with a lot more depth and character development. That is another disappointing aspect of the movie. If I want to watch an over the top action flick I do not need any justification, but this movie tried to justify the killing spree of Denzel Washington's character and poorly failed in delivering any believable performances. The first half hour or so nothing much happens except that dumb archetypes and clichés are portrayed and when the action machine starts rolling it is so quickly cut that you do not know what really happens. So the movie does not work either on the level of a believable drama/thriller , nor as a pure action movie. Of course the movie is not as bad as some oft the totally messed up blockbusters of the last years, but I absolutely cannot understand why so many people claim this movie to be something fresh and so cool. For a video clip it is way too long and for a movie it has too little substance.",2005
8,"Man on Fire has a plot seen before in many, many works of fiction and it's more than likely that if you know the premise then you can give a reasonably accurate prediction of what will happen in this film. However it is rare that it is executed so well, with terrific acting, direction, and characters. Tony Scott's directorial style may well irritate many people, the camera rarely sits still, the angle changes frequently and can be quite disorientating in the action sequences. For that reason Man on Fire is best seen on a big screen, then this problem is pretty much eradicated and you can appreciate how effective his style can be, from making action sequences that bit more visceral to his ingenious use of subtitles that reflect the way the character speaking feels rather than merely giving a translation.",2010

10,"I thought that the story of an arrogant top-flight London surgeon trying to run a practice in a chummy town in Cornwall would make for a one-note fish-out-of-water series, but instead it has been a delight every week. Doctor Martin Ellingham, for a reason that will be revealed later in the series, decides to transplant himself to a seaside village in Cornwall where he spent a few summers as a child with an aunt, who presently runs an organic farm there. Being a terse, intensely closed, firmly impersonal fellow, he is appalled at the ways of the village people who consider themselves as one big, happy, nosy family. Of course, in a series like this, we expected the clash of cultures between the coldly efficient doctor and the quirky little town to be the main storyline, but it is the diversity of their quirkiness (some of which will surprise you!) and the inventive medical cases that call the doctor's attention, and the personal incidents that test his patience, that will keep you coming back for more each week. While there is a lead cast -- Doctor Ellingham (who intensely dislikes the too familiar ""Doc Martin"" that people insist on calling him), the head schoolteacher who develops an interest in him, despite herself, the affable teddy bear of a police constable, the exasperating receptionist with a chip on her shoulder, and the jokey, prank-loving plumber played by the wonderful Ian McNeice -- none of the characters that show up fleetingly in the beginning is actually a one-off. Eventually, everyone's back story is brought to the fore. This makes the town more and more three-dimensional and you may find yourself caring quite a lot for the individuals that make up this engaging little village; yes, even for the irascible doctor, whose own back story is rather quite poignant and makes his unbending personality more understandable. The best thing about the series is that it accomplishes all this without the schmaltz that usually ruins programs of this genre. For intelligent, humorous and charming entertainment, spend an hour in the village by the sea of Doc Martin. Who knows? Maybe someday, people will be trying to find Portwenn in the same way that fans of veterinarian-writer James Herriot have been looking for his fictional Darrowby. I would certainly give it a try.",2006
9,"This gem of a series is lifted out of the sickly-sweet genre of medic/policeman in small quirky country community (often with 'heart' somewhere in the title and 'heartwarming' in the reviews - ugh!) by the spectacular social ineptness of the lead character, Doc Martin, perfectly played by Martin Clunes. Imagine the series if Doc Martin was an ordinary GP, and you'll see what I mean. I was first attracted by the wonderful scenery of Port Isaac in Cornwall (Port Wen in the series)but quickly got interested in how he was going to put his foot in it this week. The story lines are average I would say, some better than others, usually centred on a different medical incident each week, but the real interest is in the relationships between the villagers and the doctor, and how they develop over time. It is always entertaining (and even the not-so-good plot lines are enlivened by the beautiful landscape) and sometimes extremely funny - something to look forward to.",2006

As for the comment about the local lovelies, you should try the seaside towns of Cardigan Bay in Wales, a goodly number of beauties there, I assure you, it must be the bracing sea air. Regarding another comment, I too went to the church and lit a candle to pray that nobody in Hollywood will even think of making an American version of this very charming drama.

9,"This is a question as well as a comment. Following the final episode of the Doc Martin series just shown by the Australian Broacasting Commission was the caption ""Dedicated to John Coleman"". I can find no reference to John Coleman on the Doc Martin website. I am guessing he was one of the writers. Am I right? By the way, I loved the series, but one or two things bothered me. The plots were interesting enough and the most of the characters were beautifully drawn, but to some extent some of them were a bit two-dimensional. For example the professionally super-efficient Doc Martin was so rude to everyone that one could hardly believe that any of his patients would ever come back for more. The policeman was (at least until the final episode) unbelievably inept, if not dim-witted. Sorry but I couldn't accept the snake bite episode, when the Doc displayed more patience with the mad forest ranger than he had with the entire village of (reasonably) sane people. The final episode was by far the most believable and the best. On the credit side I found the casting perfect, the setting idyllic and the photography exquisite. The whole thing was so beautiful it made me wonder why I ever left the dear old place. Is there to be more? Dennis Mitchell.",2006
10,"I do not understand why some people do not understand why they love this series nor understand why they love Doc Martin. Some dedicated viewers really don't understand why they are so hooked! So I shall tell them why they love Doc Martin. Doc Martin is real. I am a registered nurse and have worked in the Operating Room (theater, if you are picky) and I can tell you this man exists. That is why I switched to the Medical Floor, to get away from the Doc Martins of the hospital. Good grief, they are intimidating. It takes years to find out how weak and vulnerable and sad they are. When a patient codes and doesn't make it, the Doc Martins of the world are left to handle their grief and feelings alone. Isn't that sad? We notice (and love) Doc Martin first of all because he oozes alpha male chemistry and we react to that with a mixture of love and hate, contempt and admiration. We love him second of all because he has transcended most of his feelings (unlike us) and has moved to a higher plane of capability because of it and we benefit from his capability and confidence. We love him thirdly because he needs our love and he has been so mistreated and has such voids within him. There are all kind of subtle clues that Doc Martin is wonderful, but none so telling as the fact that dogs love him and are not impressed by his screams and sneers. You cannot fool a dog! Why does America love this series so much? Because the British do a much finer job than we do at so many many film endeavors. From the impeccable casting to the brilliant writing and believable dialogue to the ability the British have to plumb the depths and soar the heights of human drama and comedy without having holes and gaps that need filled with obscenity or worse. Thanks to the British for their genius. They are even brilliant in the way they use color to match the characters to the environment and create an ambiance that disarms the viewer. I love British films and ""Doc Martin"" best of all. I suspect another reason America is enthralled with the Doc Martin series is because we Americans are having socialized medicine crammed down our unwilling throats, and watching socialized medicine in action adds a certain little touch of horror spice to the story that Brits probably do not even notice.",2012

One way or another he ends up in coastal England in a charming little village called Port Wen. It is supposed to be temporary but, hey, every TV series ever made is temporary when it starts. He interacts with the locals and adventures ensue. Kind, gentle, interesting adventures, adventures that at the same time intrigue you on an intellectual level and also make you wish you actually lived in Port Wen.

There is nothing especially great about the show; it isn't groundbreaking or overly clever. Just simple charm. The show isn't hilarious but rather amusing, nice.

Some references are pretty slim, though - for example ""We're coming to get you, Barbara!"" is a reference to ""The Night of the Living Dead"" - a reference that many people (including George Romero!) didn't get.

Oh and BTW so Titanic should be in the 250 too.",2010
1,"Zombie films are something that many people have tried to make and many people have failed to make well. Even George Romero and Lucio Fulci, it must be admitted, do not have the Midas touch in this genre. This goes ably to show that even when it's a single genre of horror, it's difficult to pin down.",2010
1,"OK, I am really not one of these 'the worst movie ever' gang member but this one was really bad, I mean it. I tried so hard to enjoy a little bit but I didn't smile even one time. I don't know how this movie can be rated 8 but first time in my life, I am giving such a confident 1 and if there was a chance to give something lover, I would. From the beginning to the end, it is so slow and the jokes are so bad. If you really want to watch it, fasten your seat belt not to escape screaming and drink one liter of coffee so that you don't sleep. It is not only the plot, the acting was bad as well. I didn't find the characters funny. Overall, bad, bad and plain bad.",2010
1,"Without a doubt ""Shaun of the Dead"" is one of the worst comedies (if not the worst) that hit the big screen in 2004. The characters of the film have IQ's all shy of 75. Every single one is borderline retarded. The zombies has more of a mental capacity than those of the living. I did not laugh nor so much as break a smile during this entire film. Anyone who has left a review that has stated that this movie is funny, you have been warned. The entire film takes place in about 2 locations, with very few movements along the way. I wasted over an hour of my life to watch this garbage.",2013
1,Oops! To me this movie was a total disappointment.,2011

7,"Okay, even though I surely don't regret having watched this film, I won't be joining the other reviewers around here who all claim it's a hilarious movie and/or the best horror comedy in decades. The intentions of cast and crew are good, there are plenty of good gags and the characters are likable but overall it feels like something is missing. It sure isn't obvious to mix a splatter-horror subgenre with comical situations so the premise of this 'Shaun of the Dead' doesn't work all the time. Nevertheless, there's enough ingeniousness and originality to make this a worthwhile film. The setting of a grey, banal London suburb with its typical inhabitants suits the story really well and the actors do their absolute best to provide this film with a human character. But it's not as hilarious as it looks and it's simply impossible to uphold a light-headed atmosphere when you're dealing with an apocalyptic theme. In case you're not familiar with the plot: 29-year-old Shaun is stuck in his monotonous life of dead-end job, nagging mother and lowlife roommate. His more ambitious girlfriend breaks up with him and just when he plans to make some serious changes to win her back, a mysterious disease resurrects the dead and turns the living into an endangered species. While the army of ravenous zombies keeps on growing, Shaun rescues his girl and some friends by bringing them to their favorite pub. Some of the gags (like when the gang learns to move like zombies in order to keep a low profile) are really good but the film is a bit too long and the drama eventually overrules the horror. Actually, the very best aspects in 'Shaun of the Dead' are the numerous references towards milestone zombie movies, but I fear these sublime findings are a bit lost on wider audiences. Shaun of the Dead brings homage to the Romero trilogy, The Evil Dead and many Italian classics. For true horror fans, it's a joy to track down all the subtle tributes. Overall, this gem sure is worth renting but the hype in enjoys at the moment is a bit unmerited.",2004
9,I have just come from seeing phantom and was completely swept away. The stage show is my all time favorite Broadway show and I was a bit nervous as to how Phantom and the music of the night would hold up on the big screen but I needn't have worried because it was very definitely worth the price of the ticket-and then some.,2005
10,"This is what I found myself saying when the end credits started rolling. I have seen the Stage Play 12 times. I have read the Book so may times I can not count it(LEaroux AND Kay's books). I will not put spoilers in here. All I'm going to say is go INTO it with an OPEN MIND. Some of the scenes are different from the Stage play. IT IS NOT a shot by shot remake. Bring Kleenex. Your going to need them. Butler plays Phantom with so much Intensity you CAN'T help but love him. I am NOT a fan of Minnie Driver by any means, but I have to say I liked her in this movie, she was even funny in it. As for Rossum she makes a good Christine. The costumes and the scenery were Beautiful. 2 days after seeing it, and I'm STIL IN AWE.",2004
10,"I can't believe I waited so long to see this movie. I've never seen the stage play. I lived in L.A. for about 17 years, attended acting school, and performed in some musicals before, but was never that crazy about seeing them, so I really didn't know what to expect. I thought ""Chicago"" was okay. I went to see it on a whim. But when that chandelier went up and the sweeping transformation happened to the opera house from black and white dusty ruin to a lush landscape of red velvet and gold ornate statues to the equal sweep of that unimaginably beautiful music, I literally forgot to breathe. Every time I see it I still get goosebumps. You feel that you've just been magically transported to another world. I loved every frame, every note, every performance from the very beginning to the very end. The critics must be crazy. This movie should be up for every award ever made!! I can't stop watching it. I've seen it ten times already and can't wait for the next time. It's definitely now in my top ten of all time. Joel Schumacher, and Andrew Lloyd Webber have created a MASTERPIECE!!!",2005
10,"So, I usually don't qualify my reviews, but this movie is sort of special, and the comments I've read are from all over the map so I feel I should give some idea of where I'm coming from too. ",2004
10,"I have seen the movie, Phantom of the Opera, five times, a phenomenon never experienced with any other movie in my life. The movie has such depth and rich details, making it is worthy of spending the time and money to see it five times. Please spare me any more negative comments about Gerard Butler's performance! I have seen the play in New York and in a regional theater. Of all performances I have seen, Gerard Butler's portrayal of the Phantom is the finest, most sensitive, and most provocative. His singing is full of emotion, making his character believable and powerful. I would like to see Gerard Butler get some recognition for his performance, because he lifts the character of the Phantom far beyond what it has been in the past. He was perfect for the role, and his acting and singing should be recognized as one of the best performances on the screen this year! Emmy would not have been as great as she was without the performance provided by Gerard Butler. I want to thank Gerard Butler for taking me out of the everyday details of living into a world of ""music of the night."" Speak out for Gerard Butler's receiving recogniton for his truly inspiring performance as the Phantom!",2005
10,"I couldn't speak for 20 minutes after walking out of the theater, except to say ""Oh my gosh!!!"" I saw the stage version in Lodon, Ont. with Colm Wilkinson and I thought I would hate the movie phantom. He won me over within 5 minutes. All the acting and singing is just phenomenal. Beware, though, this movie is VERY SEXY!!! My husband and I saw it on Valentine's Day and almost skipped dinner after the movie and went straight home!!!! This is not your mother's phantom. You learn so much more in the movie. The symbolism is incredible as are the effects. Sets and costumes are stunning! One to see again and again. Minnie Driver was sooo funny going on and on about her ""puppy"". She was a perfect pout. The roof scene (All I Ask of You) was filled with tension you never really see in the stage version. Being able to see such depth of expression on the actors faces added so much to the movie version. I also realized in the movie that Christine's father was a famous violinist. Notice how many of the musical themes belonging to Christine and the Phantom feature the violin. The movie also brings out the Fruedian theme of Christine's love for her deceased father and her not really knowing if her father is the Phantom or not. Go see this movie. It is worthy of all the praise it receives and more!",2005
5,"Well pinch me I must be dreaming, Joel Schumacher hs made a masterpiece? I am not dreaming and I can tell you it is true. This is everything a musical movie should be, fantastic songs, amazing sets and wonderful acting.",2004
9,"I was able to view this at a special screening and was very impressed. It is a visually stunning movie - the costuming and sets are as extravagant and lavish as the music. Gerard Butler gives a particularly anguishing and sympathetic performance as The Phantom. Emmy Rossum is beautiful portraying Christine and her transformation from a young innocent to a woman who is aware of herself, her sexuality, and the world of love. Patrick Wilson is a particularly dashing, heroic and protective Raoul and Minnie Driver provides hilarious comic relief as Carlotta. I particularly enjoyed the film's ability to delve deeper into the lives of characters. It provided depth and context and layers to all of the characters that the stage production cannot do. The entire cast was magnificent and I will be hearing the ""music of the night"" in my head for the next several days. I would definitely recommend it and can't wait to see it again.",2004
10,"We had seen only the original silent movie, not the stage play, (or even the soundtrack) before going. So we knew not what to expect. But at the very opening, as the long-dead chandelier rises to life, swinging in what seems like one endless arc, and scatters the colour of memories about as it flames back to life, and the theatre is washed in colour and majesty not seen in decades... we both knew this was going to be good. And it was. ",2005
10,"Having never seen this in any form I did not know what to expect. Being a fan of musicals I was looking forward to see this. I must say that the movie out did any expectations that I did have. The first transition into the story of the movie was absolutely fantastic, I have never seen any transitions like that. The music in the movie is brilliant and adds to the plot of the movie.",2005
9,"I think some other comments here are harsh, especially towards the performance of Emmy Rossum, who I thought made the film. Her performance visually (i.e. expressions etc) is mesmerizing. I'm sure a lot of this is down to Joel Schumacher who successfully steers the film away from just putting the stage show on to film, but has actually created something powerful in its own right, so I believe comparisons of the stage show to film are unreasonable.",2004
9,"Having not seen the musical before, and only being familiar with some of the well know songs I had no preconceptions, but was eager to see the film being a lover of all things musical. From the black and white opening scene I knew it was going to be visually splendid and from the atmosphere created knew I was in for something dramatic. Then the theatre turned to colour and all was sent spinning back in time and the busy backstage frolics of the cast at the Opera House were bought to life. It was not apparent who the leading lady would be for a while until the chorus girl Christine was encouraged forward to sing replacing the Diva and was transformed from rags to a Cinderella style dress and sang with a pure beautiful voice and made me feel all magical and warm inside especially when she hit that note at the end!! Anyway the film went on and she was re united with her childhood sweetheart who was very charming and although most say wet, I think was very caring and charming (any girl wants prince charming on a white horse) despite what they say :-) There were lots of dream like scenes to follow and the film heightened emotionally all the way to the end, I've heard the song ""Wishing you were somehow here again"" but never knew its context, but the song and scene merged beautifully together for a very sentimental moment in the film enhanced by the angel statues covered in misty snow and a very Tim Burton moment. The phantom was a mixture of anger/sadness/genius and you could understand why Christine was very weak willed in his presence. I loved it, saw it twice bought the soundtrack and rate it 9 out of 10. Karen (Freddies girlfriend) and he liked it too!",2004
10,"The Phantom of the Opera is of course a very well known story and has been adapted so many times that you would probably lose count if you tried. This of course is the musical adaptation if you may have not realized by now. Now if any part of your criticism of this film has to do with it being a musical then you probably didn't enjoy viewing it. I, myself are in no way a fan of musicals but in this case I found the experience of watching this film to be extremely gratifying.",2009
10,"One of the best movies I've ever seen. And, everyone I know who has seen it cannot get it out of their minds. Great music, perfect cast and just a great story all around; When Schumacher decided to make the Phantom a younger man, this was the key to creating a love story for the centuries. I have seen this movie 4 times because to get its full effect you have to see it on the big screen, or a plasma TV with one great sound system. But, I will purchase the DVD. I did not really know who Gerard and Emmy were but found the pair totally enchanting; singing was meaningful and sensual. I can't even imagine what the critics were thinking. Not the stage play, grant you, but Schumacher did things on the screen that could not have been done on stage. Everyone should see this movie (especially all the women).",2005
10,"It's a given: the musical is here to stay. It never went away. As a genre it went underground for almost thirty years, popping up with the frequency of a Kim Stanley film performance, until Baz Luhrmann and his Red Curtain musicals and the success of CHICAGO made it ""cool"" for moviegoers.",2006
10,"This movie totally knocked my socks off. I had never seen the stage production, and wasn't familiar with the plot or anything. But my friend saw it and he was just like, ""You HAVE to see this movie."" And he was right - as soon as we left the theatre, we were both plotting ways to get the rest of our friends to come. (Btw, he saw it five times in a week - slightly obsessed.) If you haven't seen it yet, turn off your computer right now and go. I mean it.",2005
10,"This movie was really a turn on! I've already seen it a few times and can't believe that such a great movie was made! I also can't believe it wasn't nominated for the Oscar-Best Picture-because I truly believe it deserves it. What's wrong with Hollywood that they can't see a movie of such extraordinary quality? The music, costumes, acting and sets were gorgeous. The story was intense and multi-layered to the max. They really pulled out all the stops on this one and went over the top, but it really worked! It is such a classic 19th century fantasy with a heroine pursued by two amazing suitors! (They don't make guys like that anymore!) The Phantom was the most sublime artist ever (georgeous guy that I'm sure lots of women would go crazy over!) For me, the genius of this movie was in the details. The subtle gestures and nuances of imagined touch between the Phantom and Cristine and between Cristine and Raoul. There's some truly extraordinary sexual vibes passing between Cristine and the Phantom when the Phantom leaps on stage and sings ""Past the Point of No Return"" with her. If they were really alive, I'm sure they'd never forget it! I found this movie a million times sexier than 90% of the movies that are made that are suppose to be sexy!! I'm sure I won't see a movie like this again! Bravo!!!",2005
10,"I have capitalized the word ADAPTATION in my review title to emphasize the fact that this is a film interpretation of the stage show - not a direct imitation. People expecting to view an exact stage to screen version of this musical will probably be disappointed. HOWEVER, if you are willing to watch this film with an open mind you will see that it is still the same story with the same wonderful music with only a few modifications. The biggest change was the decision to move the chandelier crash to the end of the film. In my opinion this was a smart move as it wouldn't make sense to have the climax of the story occur in the middle of the film. It works for the stage as it's an amazing end to the first act, it gets everyone excited for the second half of the show. In a movie there is no intermission to separate the chandelier crash from Masquarade so it would be kaboom! chandelier crash wham! Masquarade - there's nowhere to go but down if the story is kept in the original order. Another change is the sword fight sequence which has been added to the graveyard scene. While I think the Phantom shooting fireballs in the movie would have been laughable, it is slightly annoying that here Raoul has the chance to defeat the Phantom but doesn't - only to immediately sing about a plan to capture the Phantom. There was also the choice to speak some lines that were previously sung. I personally don't mind the changes, in some ways I think it makes the meaning of those phrases stand out. In particular Christine and Raoul's part in Masquarade - to me the line ""it's an engagement not a crime"" seems more forceful when spoken.",2005
10,"I always hated musicals as a kid, but I saw this movie, and I knew that I would never see musicals the same way again. I fell in love with the Phantom from the first moment that I saw him. This is really a magical, romantic movie. The only thing that I dislike about it is the ending: The Phantom doesn't get Christine. I think he should. But, nevertheless, it the the greatest movie ever produced and the greatest story ever portrayed. Whether or not you like musicals, this movie is sure to be one that you will never forget---> For good reasons. I encourage everyone to see it. You will be lost instantly in a world of beauty, madness, horror, magic, and love. And, if you are like most people I know who have seen this movie, you will never want it to end. The actors themselves light up the screen and play their parts to perfection. Gerard Butler makes a perfect Phantom, and Emmy Rossumm the perfect Christine. It is, truly, the best movie I have ever seen.",2006
10,"I just saw this movie yesterday and it completely blew me away. The beginning is breathtaking; the transformation of the theater left me staring at the the screen while the overture played. I have seen the stage production once, and the movie was a very big step from it, but not in a negative way. In fact, it added just the small bit of story that left me more satisfied with this movie than with the Broadway version. The voices of every character were stunning, just the way they should have been. And my very favorite part; the Phantom. Gerard Butler portrayed him beautifully, i couldn't have asked for a more brilliant performance. What more can i say? I know i'll be seeing this one again- very soon i hope, and you have to see it too. I'ts the most powerful film i've seen for quite some time, and you'll be missing out on a great experience if you don't go to the movies to see the Phantom of the Opera.",2005
9,"The Phantom of the Opera is based off of both Gaston Leroux's novel, and Andrew Lloyd Webber's stage musical. It tells the story of a mysterious man that lives beneath the Paris Opera House, and is madly in love with a young ballet dancer. The managers of the opera house think he is a phantom. The young dancer believes he is the Angel of Music, sent by her dead father to watch over her. When the phantom begins to kill and cause damage to the opera house, the dancer's heroic suitor sets out to stop the phantom once and for all. With great music and stunning sets, this is the best version of the tale on film.",2006
8,"I was surprised how good this movie was, not stupid as I figured. It's another one of those based-on-a-comic book hero films that seem to be popular nowadays (Hellboy, Batman, Sin City, Spiderman, Superman, etc.) ",2005
10,"Someone said that this movie was too dark for the genre...He must not have ever read any of the source material. The Punisher may be one of the darkest comic book characters ever created. This film and especially Thomas Jane, get that. This film is one of the better in the genre, because it sticks to the source better than most.",2005
8,Wonderful Camera work and acting.,2005
10,"This is the second version of 'The Punisher', and while I enjoy the original that starred Dolph Lungren, I LOVED this one. Thomas Jane was amazing, he definitely had the essence of the tortured Frank Castle down perfect. The acting in this movie was extremely well done, a lot more well done than many people (critics) have given it credit for. I think that John Travolta even though he can be a bit annoying at times played a great bad guy, and his character was sinister, and cruel, but loving at the same time. Will Patton I think almost stole the show with his portrayal of his character Quentin Glass, because he had a charisma about him that was equally disturbing. It was a great movie, not just 'great for what it was'. The story was good, the stunts, and the violence amazing, and I really hope they greenlight for a sequel.",2004
8,"Audiences have become so accustomed to being overloaded by CGI effects in recent comic book adaptations that the idea of a tougher, leaner approach seemed to catch viewers and critics off-guard, when this latest adaptation of ""The Punisher"" premiered. Sadly, most critics chose to ignore the very qualities that made this film so special, never accepting that the story is closer in spirit to ""Sin City"" than ""Spider-Man"" or ""Daredevil"". Now that the film is available on DVD, I invite everyone to take a second look at this dark tale of the fine line one man walks between Justice and Vengeance...you may be surprised by how good it really is! The film is carefully constructed to allow viewers an opportunity to see dedicated undercover cop Frank Castle in action, and to understand the caring, loving family man Frank Castle was...before mob boss Howard Saint, and his equally ruthless wife, Livia (played by a remarkably low-key John Travolta and Laura Harring), takes vengeance for their son's death by ordering the brutal execution of Castle's entire family. As conceived, with total conviction, by Thomas Jane, Castle is so completely traumatized that he 'lets go' of what remained of his compassion, and becomes a human weapon, devoid of pity, living only to see justice done, in equal measure to the crime.",2006
8,"Though I was unfamiliar with the comic book character, I was impressed with the all around quality of the production. It didn't hurt to have the cosmically beautiful Laura Harring (mullholland drive)cast as Saint's wife. Should have had more of her character. Thomas Jane turned in a very worthy performance, as I think it's difficult to play these comic book characters without causing nausea and guffaws. Interesting that there was a bit of philosophy re society and it's criminal element, kudos to the director/writer for a cogent screenplay. Did Jane remind anyone of the french actor in the original Immortal? i.e. his guttural delivery and dour countenance.",2005
7,"This movie came onto the scene with very little fanfare. It isn't a CGI powerhouse. There's no Matrix/Kill Bill style fight scenes. But what it lacks in modern trends it more than makes up for in a good old fashioned revenge plot. Touting a story that would have been fit for a Clint Eastwood flick like Outlaw Josey Wales or Hang 'em High, the Punisher takes the viewer on journey into the soul of a gritty vigilante. Thomas Jane plays the lead role to perfection, his voice acting is incredible. Although this isn't your daddy's (or Dolph's) emotionless Punisher. He is much more cerebral here than in most of the other media he has popped up in, and more human, but not any more humane. Using the tried and true style of fist fights and pyrotechnics this movie keeps the character rooted in his all too mortal persona. The supporting characters turn in equally descent roles, the likes of John Travolta worked well, although nothing outstanding. No doubt about it, Thomas Jane ran away with this one. He's just a normal guy doing super-normal things, with a lot of gunfire and explosions to boot. If you are in the target demographic (Male aged 17-30) you will definitely enjoy this film. If not, proceed at your own risk.",2006
10,"Man I really love this film. Great acting, great storyline, perfect dark brutal violence is what makes this film so really special out of all other marvel adapt ions. Other marvel movies I've seen so far from Spider-man 1 & 2, Daredevil, Fantastic Four, X2 X-men united. All these marvel flicks are great but The Punisher measures way up past great. Thomas Jane dose a great leading role as well as John Travolta a great villain role. Of course for all who have seen the movie all know the plot. After castles final operation spinning out of control killing one of the saint twins, Howard and Livia order out a brutal mob attack on castle family reunion, killing everyone, his wife, his son will, his mom and dad, cousins, uncles, I can imagine castles pain and taste for vengeance on the saint family. More other great work is the stunts the car chase sense where castle is hunted down by a bounty hunter harry heck of course hes some sorta country boy who was probably hinting castle with a tune that he was gonna attempt to kill castle who also gets his throat slashed by castle, a 2nd hit-man the Russian played by a great wrestler Kevin Nash probably without a doubt the most brutal sequence in the movie. Alittle bad language here and there but the best thing about this film is that it is very true to both the character and comics. The Punisher is a hard-R rated movie delivering a great action film of this generation. Fans of the comics will love this and probably by now are hoping for a sequel as I am myself! 10/10 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA+ all the way :)",2006
7,"The film talks on a police agent G man(Thomas Jane)called Frank Castle whose family(wife Samantha Morton and dad Roy Scheider) was wiped out by a mobsters (John Travolta,wife Laura Harring and son Ben Foster, besides Will Patton) retaliates,thus he executes an incredible revenge originating a bodycount about numerous baddies.He's helped by a freaks group (Rebeca Romijin Stamos and others). The final confrontation amongst the starring and the enemies is breathtaking and groundbreaking .",2005
10,"This movie is one of those movies that make you wonder why every movie isn't as good. However, if you are aren't the type that likes intense violence and content a bit more mature than PG, then I don't recommend this at all to you.",2005
10,Thomas Jane's portrayal of the Punisher is right out of the comic book. Dark Humorless driven The Punisher is not meant to be funny That's up to his supporting cast. However the one complaint I have with the film is they changed his origin Why? They also Changed Frank Castle the man and in doing so altered the film in such a way it loses it's relationship with the original marvel hero. But the film works Hensleigh delivers a power bomb of a film it packs a punch and it entertains. If I wasn't a fan of The Punisher maybe the film would've gotten less from me then the rating I did give it of ten. Travolta comes thru hamming it up every chance he gets and creating a merciless enemy in his Howard saint. Will Patton is superb in a thankless job playing the sidekick to the main villain. but his Quenton Glass Sparkles with a sadistic gleam and he helps drive the plot forward. But the film rightfully belongs to Thomas Jane he is creates a Punisher struggling with his humanity and knowing what he has to do and slowly turning his back on every thing he's ever known to Punish the gulity. Good movie Good effort true Punisher fans will not be disappointed. And if you're not a fan this movie might make you a fan of the Punisher.,2010
7,"Producers and distributors alike can try to market this as a superhero movie all they want but the fact is that at the end of the day The Punisher is an action movie  no more, no less. That is not to say it is a bad achievement, for the end product is fun, exhilarating and stylish. I do however feel it is extremely important to debunk the 'comic book' label since it is both unjustly applied and it will perhaps generate false expectations from the mainstream audience.",2006

10,"This is by far the most realistic and fantastic comic book movie ever made.The acting is superb Tom Jane gives an unforgettable performance,and John Travolta is the perfect villain.The action in this film is stylized,intense,and always for a reason.It's a very serious movie about a depressed man whose family is murdered,and he goes on an endless quest to avenge them.It is without a doubt the best story of vengeance to date.The Punisher defeats Kill Bill to become the number one revenge movie by delivering a great story,superb solid acting,and unbelievable action.Comic book movies are certain to change in style and this will be the ice breaker for that to happen.The Punisher is an unbelievable comic to film adaption and i recommend it to anyone and everyone.This is the style that started the on screen change from movies like X-men and Spiderman to the darker,more emotional Spiderman 2,Daredevil,Sin City,History Of Violence,and Batman Begins.I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this magnificent piece of art.WELL DONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!",2005
8,"This movie seemed to stick to the spirit of the comics. No radioactive spiders, no mutant genes, no demons and angels, no magic. In short, only a slight suspension of disbelief. Honestly the only scene that didn't seem completely possible was Frank's survival. It was entertaining and told a decent story. Its not perfect, the main villain is a bit over acted (easily over looked in a comic book movie) and Thomas Jane owns the screen.",2005
10,"I think that this movie rocks. Tom Jane is so sexy. He plays a good part. I don't know why but I fell in love with this movie. I watch it every day and night. There can never be a movie better than this. It is so cool with all that stuff that he does. I love it. I don't think they could have made it any better. It is a perfect length, too. I wish that I could have been in that movie working with Tom Jane. That would have made my life so happy. When i first saw it I was memorized so bad that I went and kept watching it over and over until I had all words memorized. I would watch it so much that for about a week I got no sleep. I just love it so much. It rocks and it is awesome. They could not have gotten anyone else to play those parts.",2005

In any case, I haven't read that book, and was blissfully unaware that this film was supposedly adapted from one. I found it surprisingly cute. Many of the campy things hit the mark, like the ""medeival modern"" anachronistic setting, reminiscent of The Flintstones cartoon wherein it was filled with modern things constructed from prehistoric materials; and the modern songs transposed to the time setting herein. That last was a bit like Moulin Rouge, which annoyed me at first, but then grew on me. I don't believe that I've seen this Anne Hathaway before, but she is intriguing. Her vivacity and wide smile remind me a bit of Julia Roberts. Can't say that I was much impressed with Hugh Dancy or Aiden McArdle. Minnie Driver was most charming as the incompetent fairy, and Vivica Fox was quite amusing as the lush fairy. It's too bad that Parminder Nagra's part was so small, as she always lights up a screen. And Cary Elwes couldn't hide his amusement with the material as he munched on the scenery. I say check this out, if you aren't going to throw a fit over the book.",2009
1,"Warning--if you have read the book, do not see the movie--you WILL become violently ill! O'Haver, the director, looked at the story (a beautiful, classic book by Gail Levine that everyone should read), and decided that he didn't like the current plot--so he made up a new one, and still had the gall to say that it was ""based"" on Levine's masterpiece of a book (kudos to ""I, Robot"" for actually being truthful and honest enough to say that the movie was ""inspired"" by the books--it's something for O'Haver to one day aspire to). He also made up new characters and changed the old characters to fit his new plot--Char's parents are dead, and there's a new evil uncle (Elwes) with a cheesy snake servant who is trying to kill Char and take over the crown--there's also a new elf friend of Ella's who wants to be a lawyer (can you say Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer?), but is forced to only sing and dance by this new evil and tyrannical uncle created by O'Haver--ogres are also now not evil, but only ""misunderstood""! And Ella's father is nice and caring, Mandy is no longer her caring, sensible fairy godmother, but a ditz and a magical klutz, and the wonderful old-fashioned world created by Levine has been warped and cheapened by the director so that it's a faux modern world (the modern costumes add to the cheap and fake look of the film). Overall, the movie bears little resemblance to the book in anything but the title and character names, and is the worst adaptation I have ever seen, as well as a silly and stupid movie in itself. Hathaway does indeed reprise her role in Princess Diaries (another terrible adaptation with changed character names, setting, roles, etc, though not as bad as this one)--to the extent that there's even a debate scene that mirrors the one in Princess almost exactly (forget finishing school--they have modern school in the movie!).",2005
1,"If you've ever read Ella Enchanted, you will be shocked that a movie studio couldso thoroughly ruin an excellent story. At it's heart, Ella Enchanted(the book), is a story of love, frustration, and other human emotions.Although you may find yourself smiling at times, it is more of a romantic/angsty fairytale than a comedic fairytale, complete with one graying fairy godmother, two banister-sliding protagonists, and three masque balls (excluding Sir Peter's and Dame Olga's wedding reception). What Ella Enchanted does NOT contain is an evil talking snake. When Ella finally is able to find the strength to save not only herself, but Char and the entire kingdom, you are so happy for her that, chances are, you cry. As a matter of fact, I would say I cried more than I laughed reading this book.",2005
6,"Despite the fact that ""Ella Enchanted"" is a children's novel, I really enjoyed it. It was clever, entertaining, and impressively original for having been based on the age-old story of Cinderella.",2007
8,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film, it was clever, original and entertaining. The interesting opening scenes were great as they transported you to the fairytale world. I was very happy to see Eric Idle was the narrator and Anne Hathaway was brilliant and instantly likable as Ella, with Hugh Dancy the perfect handsome prince. The Elf (another familiar face- Dudley Moore in 'Not Only But Always') is wonderful as the sidekick. I also thought the story was very good, it was slightly predictable at first, but then there were some interesting twists, where I think the usual fairytale storyline was changed to great effect. The way the Fairytale land echoed aspects of home were amusing, with wooden escalators, taxi carriages In a way, I liked it more than Shrek, because of the fact that it was less 'polished' and maybe more British. I would definitely recommend 'Ella Enchanted' to anyone who wants a fun and entertaining film.",2005
8,"Ella Enchanted, starring Anne Hathaway, Hugh Dancy, Minnie Driver, and Eric Idle, is a contemporary epic fairy tale, sitting on the top shelf with such classics as The Wizard of Oz, and Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.",2004
5,"Ella Enchanted is a charming film that's good for the whole family. In this storybook fairy tale gone wrong, Anne Hathaway plays Ella, a girl given the magical gift of ""obedience"" by her fairy godmother at birth which turns into a curse because she can't refuse any command, even from those who abuse this fact. To try to regain control of her life, Ella goes on a quest to get the ""gift"" removed, meeting ogres and giants and a dreamy prince (Hugh Dancy) along the way. The plot sounds stupid but the movie is a lot better then I expected it to be. Its hard to take the film serious at some points though and sometimes its not exactly clear what the plot is. I have never read the book so I can't compare but my friend said that they change a lot of things. The cast, for the most part, is pretty good with the best being Anne Hathaway but she needs to start picking different roles to avoid being a typecast. I thought the acting from Hugh Dancy was horrible and it would have been better if they would have gone with someone else. Vivica A. Fox, Cary Elwes and Minnie Driver all have small roles and all do good job. The film is of course cheesy at some parts and all the gimmickry can become annoying after awhile. The film is pretty predictable but that shouldn't turn you away .The film is only 96 minutes long so it isn't a real punishment to watch the film. There are some things about the movie that didn't make sense and there are also a lot of pointless characters that could have been used without. In the end I think kids will really like Ella Enchanted Rating 7/10 if you have never read the book then you have a better chance of enjoying it. However, if you have read the book then you will probably hate it {like my friend did} because they change a lot.",2005
3,"If you are seeing this movie because of the book with which it shares its title (and not much else), spare yourself. ",2005
1,I am an Ella Enchanted book fan. I think that the book was a great read for people of all ages. When i first heard that a movie was going to come out i was excited because i had always thought it would make a great movie. That excitement soon faded away once i saw the preview then the actual movie. The director did a horrible job in turning the book into a movie. The whole story line was practically changed and the whole trying to make the book more modern was a horrible idea. Not only did the book change the story line but it also changed the mood and tone of the whole idea. The movie was so bad that even if i had not read the book and only watched the movie I would have thought the worst of it also.,2005
4,"SPOILERS Fairy tales help us feel good about life. Often changed beyond belief from their original style (just look at Disney's alterations to multiple different classics), they make you smile and forget the real world for a while. It's particularly inappropriate then for Eric Idle's narrator to literally tell you to get back to reality. Telling the story of 'Ella Enchanted', Idle is just one of many flaws with this predictable and vomit inducing film. Possessing few moments of true pleasure, the story is average and feels incredibly amateur. Badly shot, often badly acted (a shock considering some of the names on the cast sheet) and always awkward, you do wonder why you finish with a smile on your face.",2005
1,"I highly anticipated this movie's release, as Ella Enchanted has been one of my favorite books since I first read it about 10 years ago. It's a great story, a twist on the Cinderella story that's sweet, funny, interesting, and engaging to both younger readers (as I was when I first read it) and to older ones (I'm in college now, and I still love it). That said, this COULD have been a really fantastic movie--there was a lot of potential. I've seen the movie once, and it was more than enough. I watched it with increasing horror as the original story was ripped to shreds by a producer/director/creative team/WHATEVER who clearly did NOT read the book or even get what the story was supposed to be about. They turned it into some fantasy-feminist-musical disgrace. The whole movie is simply a joke, and to cap it off they have a god-awful song and dance sequence at the end involving Elton John, Kiki Dee, Anne Hathaway in white go-go boots and a miniskirt (singing dreadfully, I might add), and knights and ogres dancing and leaping across the screen.",2007
7,"I say, not bad. Wonderful cast, so-so funny and incredibly catchy songs. It never appear to me that Anne Hathaway will be doing a musical movie but this looks good on her. I am just wondering whether she really sings that or is it just she mouthing the words. She looks gorgeous, no doubt. The kingdom looks so old and ancient, yet the minds of the villagers can be so modern, like do you think there would be girls cheering and holding 'I LOVE YOU, PRINCE CHARS' board back in the olden days? No, right? It would have been better if it happened in a modern and civilized world but I believe there wouldn't be any elves and giants and fairies then, would they? I was just thinking how good the Prince will look with his hair spiked up, tuxedos and guards and Merz instead of those kingly suits filled with metals and swords.",2009
6,SPOILERS ,2008
1,"This is the first time I've felt compelled to write a movie review. But ""Ella Enchanted"" was my favorite childhood book, and this movie completely butchered it.",2005
1,"Ella Enchanted is got to be the worst movie based from a book I've seen so far. I've read and loved the book so much!!! Which was written by Gail Carson Levine. I was excited at first to hear it would be made into a movie but was really disappointed to see it had strayed from the original book plot by very much. Especially the setting, it was quite cheesy and corny how they try to make fun of fairy tale genre. It was stupid how they put some Modernized elements in there. ",2004
1,"I Absolutely HATED THIS MOVIE!!!!! It was ridiculous, the ending was the STUPIDEST ending I've ever seen. If you loved Ella Enchanted the book I warn you: DO NOT SEE THE MOVIE!!! The only resemblance the movie had to the book was the names, places and the fact that Ella was cursed to always be obiedient. Ella's father IS NICE. Not, mean, lying, or selfish. Mandy is YOUNG AND PRETTY, not old and plump...oh, and she accidentally turned her boyfriend into a book because she actually uses magic, but isn't very good at it. Prince Char had an evil Uncle (who owns a talking snake.....pointless) who killed Char's father. The Ogres are NICE, NOT pursuassive, NOT hairy, and their butts hang out like stereotypical plumbers'. The elves are forced to sing and dance, Slanan wants to be a lawyer...the giants are FORCED to grow crops and Kupoduk (spelling...I have no idea) resembles a mob boss. That's only HALF of it, I'm NOT kidding. Not only was this ""movie"" entirely disloyal to the book...it wasn't even good...not even remotely. The ONLY thing I will say for this movie is that the actors they chose to portray Char and Ella were perfect (the way they looked anyway) Char was insecure and Ella wasn't nearly as funny and clever as she is in the book.",2005
10,"When I first spotted that movie on HBO. I saw only few minutes of it and it looked like a really great movie. When I saw the whole thing for the whole thing for the first time. I really enjoyed it. I thought that Anne Hathaway did really good playing that character. Hugh Dancy did a great job playing the prince. Cary Elwes did a good job too. All other people who worked on that movie. Did a great job and also worked really hard. This movie is worth watching it has a lot of things. Like elves,ogres,giants and more. It has really good music too. It is a kind of movie I will be watching a again and again. It is a kind of movie that whole family will enjoy.",2005
8,"I saw this film recently, and contrary to what I expected, it was really good. I went to the premiere, expecting it to be a babyish film, when in fact it was for all ages. I think Anne Hathaway should step away from her more stereotypical fairytale movies (i.e. Ella Enchanted, The Princess Diaries) because they're getting old. I think that Lucy Punch's character was far too annoying for me to like this film a lot, but I thought Jennifer Higham's character was really sweet (Well, as sweet as an ""ugly sister"" could be.) As usual with her performances, I thought Joanna Lumley was hilarious. Two other strong performances in this film were Minnie Driver and Hugh Dancy. Minnie Driver, in particular, was brilliant. However, I do think they could have picked a more attractive person to play Char.",2004
3,As an atmospheric scientist I was intrigued to see this movie. The basic premise of this movie is based on the idea of anthropogenically induced (human) global warming resulting in a catastrophic set of weather events that in a matter of a week will plunge the Earth into its next ice age.,2008
8,"I really enjoyed this film by director Roland Emmerich a great deal. It is a fast-paced, exciting, suspenseful film filled with wonderful images, great CGI effects, plausible acting, and even a coherent script. How realistic is it? I hope not at all, but the director made the film so that it seems very real and like something that MIGHT happen. The story revolves around some major climatic shifts that cause the entire Northern hemisphere to become Artic tundra. New York City is devastated as are other major cities all over Europe. Dennis Quaid gives a good performance as a climatologist that predicted some of these events. We see things through his perspective and that of his son for much of the movie. The acting in general is good in this film. I particularly liked Ian Holm's role as the British meteorologist stuck in the middle of nowhere while these changes advanced. Much of the credit for the film's success must go to Emmerich. This is easily one of his best films. He keeps his viewer on the edge of his/her seat through the entire film. Action is the film's primary objective, but Emmerich also uses a lot of humanity in what his character's motivations are, and I for one, enjoyed seeing that side of humanity rather than what I probably would see under similar circumstances. As a previous viewer noted, this is a great popcorn movie!",2004
1,"This movie is TYPICAL Hollywood. And by that I mean it's all glitz and glamour without any substance. Don't get me wrong the special effects are great (although weather effects are easy to pull off at this point). But the movie has no point what so ever!!! Whatever little plot there is, is terrible. ",2004
8,"I was leery of a heavy propaganda piece on ""global warming,"" but I still saw this and found that, yeah that's what it was but it was really more of just a straight adventure story than anything else.....and not a bad one, at that. The first 50 minutes of this two-hour film have the ""fun parts"" where the special-effects dominate. We see all kinds of radical weather disasters that are extremely dramatic and entertaining to watch, even if they don't make a bit of sense.",2006
1,"The folks who actually like this movie are the reason Hollywood makes very few quality movies any more. If you don't care then why should they? This movie is so bad from the beginning. Numerous tornadoes pummeling a West Coast city and there are actually people flying in helicopters to get a closer look. That's a brainy idea. Buildings freezing and crumbling yet the people outside don't seem to be affected so much. The ""walk"" from Philadelphia to New York? And in record time no less. I do like the fact that they had the foresight to have Antarctic weather gear handy for just these occasions. What of the tent that was able to withstand the chill but not the Empire State building? Call your local Army Navy store....they really need to stock these tents. I also found it amazing that any lines of communications were not really affected, including the under freezing water pay phone. The only ones who had communications losses were, of course, the main characters.....ah drama!! I know they were in a library but you think they could have possibly tried to burn all the wooden tables and chairs around them? Seems that they would burn warmer and for longer than books. The acting was horrific, the directing was terrible, the script was unbelievably bad and the special effects were anything but special. It certainly rates up there with Godzilla 2000 and Armageddon......it actually makes Independence Day look like one of the all time greats!",2005
3,"Well for me this film wasn't one I was looking forward to, initially when I saw the adverts I thought I wanted to see it, but after reading some blurb about it I was concerned that it was going to turn into the usual Hollywood 'adventure' drivel...Sadly my thoughts came true.",2004
1,"Okay, this wasn't as mind-numbing as ""Alexander"", and I did see it only on cable...but the whole time I was watching it I felt uncomfortable, as if I was looking at a really bad multiple-vehicle collision with lots of injuries. You know you shouldn't, but some morbid part of you won't let you turn away...",2005
1,"--WARNING: Spoilers below-- Terrible writing, terrible acting, terrible plot. One of the worst films I've ever seen. How convenient that right after Jack Hall discovers the plate breaking away in Antarctica and right as he presents this to the ""Global Warming Conference,"" all his predictions begin to come true! Wow, what a coincidence. What an insult to my intelligence. At least have all that take place >75 years prior. ",2004
1,"This movie is so typical of Hollywood that it is unbelievable. This movie not only was the most implausible film I have ever had the displeasure of experiencing, but it redefines the phrase ""political agenda."" Global Warming and climate change are the hot issues of the last few years so, naturally, the movie industry lends itself to spitting out irrelevant garbage about the subject. The main idea of the movie is that man is destroying the planet, neglecting the environment, and abusing nature....... SO MOTHER NATURE RETALIATES!!!!!! New York is flooded, hit by massive tsunamis, and frozen, LA is decimated by tornadoes, and three gigantic freezing land hurricane blizzards obliterate everything north of the equator. All because we have hit a critical desalinization point which is a fancy made-up Hollywood word for not enough salt in the ocean. You may be thinking: wow, this movie sounds pretty implausible, but it gets better.... much better. All of these cataclysms happen in a number of days instead of the rather consistent million year cycles the earth generally operates on. In addition, during the freezing of New York, the buildings freeze from top to bottom which blatantly disregards the fact that heat rises. One may say, you are taking this movie way too seriously, but I think that movies like this are genuine problems for society. The political overtones in this movie are anything but subtle and now we're going to have a bunch of global warming activists running around that think bs like this could actually happen.",2008
2,"The music during the opening credits is beautiful and the movie is full of great CGI, but sadly that is all you can enjoy. Unfortunately, there are so many flaws in the film from start to end that make it very implausible.",2006
1,"The day after tomorrow... I still will be angry to have wasted 2 hours of my life. Plot holes as big as the holes in the ozone layer, bad performances all around that send cold shivers down your spine (in a bad way) and an embarrassing attempt to manipulate emotions by creating forced drama. Roland Emmerich showed us once more that he is not capable of making a good film, although the original idea of this movie is interesting.",2007
1,"Scientifically, global warming/climate change should, by now, be unquestioned by most folk. However, this film will do little to help the environmental cause because of its hysterical stand. Scientifically, this film has the time frame all totally wrong. Melting ice caps, both north and south could not happen in such a short space of time as suggested in the film (DAYS?). And if this premise is wrong, then all that follows based on that, will be wrong as well. The three northern hemisphere storms shown on the computer monitors are rotating anticlockwise, i.e LOW pressure (as in hurricanes, with hot air rising UP) so it is impossible to be sucking cold air DOWN from the stratosphere. High pressure systems in the northern hemisphere rotate clockwise. How do land-line telephones operate under water? Why burn paper books, when there is so much more heat-efficient wooden furniture? The Statue of Liberty must have a pretty strong base to with=stand such a 50 meter surge wave. The list of further improbabilities could be rather long. And the acting/script is predictable/pedestrian.",2005
7,"OK, definitely this is not very smart movie and it has many holes in the storyline, but if you like this kind of movies you will got a lot of fun! I mean, you should know what you can expect of this kind of movies. If you like movie ""Independence Day"" you will know what I mean (BTW good recommendation from IMDb team!). If you want art or some wisdom message or you are searching for holes and sanity in the storyline, forget it. Go and watch some European authors. But if you are looking for fun, want to relax yourself, to see some amazing and very realistic computer effects go and watch it! You will not regret. For true impression big theater screen is mandatory!",2005
8,The Good; The special effects duh. Min blowing and bigger than Elvis. Whole lot of fun and if it wasn't for them this movie would be crap(er). Characters have a whole lot of potential if you completely ignore Dennis Quaid and there are some humorous moments in there. It's visually engaging and not too taxing on the ole noggin. I enjoyed the ending especially the fact that the so called first world now rely on the third world. So petty much an entertaining film HOWEVER.......,2005
1,"This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The plot is almost the same as Independence Day and Armagedon (two other pretty bad movies), the dialogue is awful, there are wholes in the plot everywhere (when did a fast food restaurant protect people from a super-freeze?), the characters are miscast (Jake G. was a high schooler maybe ten years ago), and the actors all reach new lows (poor Dennis Quaid). Some parts make no sense (like when Dennis Quaid walks 40 miles through a blizzard in less than a day). On top of all these problems the movie seems like nothing more than a slap in the face of the Bush administration for not dealing with global warming. There is even a Cheney-look-alike vice-president. I would rather light my hair on fire or be pricked in the eyeball with a poison needle than sit through this thing again.",2005
1,"The only thing good about this movie was the coming attractions. The kicker for me is when the guys crash the pickup truck outside of Philadelphia but manage to hoof it in snow shoes in a mega super storm to NYC..with a functional GPS device and find his kid at the library, which happens to be buried under snow. The idea of this movie is great but it is made poorly and the acting is just average. There are the wolves on the ship. Really? How did they get on there? The idea there would be medicine for his girlfriend on that same ship, the only bottle being in English. What a surprise. Oh yeah, and let's evacuate half the country. This definitely could have been made a whole heck of a lot better",2013
4,THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW ,2005
3,"What an annoying movie! The Day After Tomorrow is filled with every disaster movie cliché in the book. Why does there have to be a child with cancer who is too ill to move as the impending doom threatens? Why is it necessary to have people fall in love during the middle of a crisis? Why should we care about characters that are only on screen for a few minutes before they die? Why does the homeless guy know more about what's going on than most anyone else? Why did the parents in the movie have to be estranged, only to resolve their differences as the disaster strikes? Why does the Dick Cheney look-alike Vice-President, the most prominent government official, have to be such a narrow minded character? If you've seen on disaster movie, you've no doubt run into a few of these examples of the lack of originality found in The Day After Tomorrow. Most every event and character reaction to those events can be predicted with incredible accuracy.",2006
7,"The film deals about ice melting of the Arctic created by global weather change of the hole ozone. The movie is impressive , New York's flood is overwhelming .",2004
9,"In a world wrought with unoriginal and humor-lacking teen movies, The Girl Next Door provides a beacon of light. The director's hardest battle was to insure that although 90% of the cast are teenagers, that this movie should not be labeled as a teen comedy.",2005
8,"The Girl Next Door is just simply an entertaining movie.  It's got plenty of flaws - almost every single scene of the second half of the film seems to act as the climax, and then the movie keeps going - but it's also got one of the most appealing casts I've seen in a while.  Emile Hirsh (Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys, Emperor's Club) is the central character Matthew, about to graduate from high school.  He's just plain likable.  The drop-dead gorgeous Elisha Cuthbert (Kim Bauer on 24, in a very different type of role here) is the title character, Danielle.  Matthew's two friends and one of Danielle's associates played by Tim Olyphant are particular standouts in terms of comic relief; the movie is genuinely funny.  Funny, a bit silly, and at times honestly sweet, it's an entertaining movie that's harmless and worth seeing.",2004
10,"The Girl Next Door's tagline ""Matt didn't see her coming...but all his friends have!"" is very deceiving, because the movie is not like that at all. When you see this, you'll expect a raunchy, borderline porn movie, but what you get is a refreshing, adorable, and sweet love story with great performances from Emile Hirsch and Elisha Cuthbert.",2006
10,"Here we have a great example of how decent writers, armed with creative juice to spare, can take a well-worn plot and rework it to make it seem fresh.  Just when you think you've got the next twist figured out, you're surprised.  This happens throughout the movie, making The Girl Next Door one of the most charming, smart and subversive teen comedies I've seen in a long time - beautifully written, perfectly cast, a real pleasure from start to finish.  ",2004
10,"The Girl Next Door isn't a riotous, laugh-out-loud comedy, à la American Pie or Road Trip (don't get me wrong, I think they are fine movies of a different genre), nor should it be treated as such when being reviewed. It's much more mature, a sweet delight of a story that has you chuckling in amusement rather than rolling on the floor guffawing. For that, I would hardly even classify it in the generic 'comedy' genre. I must admit, I did go in thinking that I'd spend two hours of my life enjoying yet another teen comedy, with an overdone plot, jokes bordering on distasteful, and up to the brim with gratuitous nudity. However, I came out with so much more.",2006
9,"I did not see this movie in theaters. I usually wait for teen films to come out on video before viewing them. I must say, the way this movie was marketed, one would figure that this flick is along the lines of such classics as Bring It On and Can't Hardly Wait. Though this movie definitely is now part of the illustrious teen film library, it runs a little bit deeper than the average adolescent flick.",2005
7,"Oh, to a neighbor like Elisha Cuthbert.  Not that my neighbors are bad. Want a cup of sugar?  Just knock.  Want help will the ball cock in your toilet?  Ring next door.  All of this is incredibly beneficial, but oh, to have a neighbor like Elisha Cuthbert!",2004
10,"So yes most guys are going to see the movie because of the achingly beautiful and hot Elisha Cuthbert. And she only disappoints a little. Otherwise this is the perfect vehicle for her playing a porn star who is trying to change her ways and live more of a normal teen-age girl's life. As she stays at her aunt's house, she meets her next door neighbor after he spies on her undressing. I think a lot of guys will be able to relate to Emile Hirsch's character--a young guy who is trying so hard to break out of his shell. Along comes Elisha who is more worldly and adventurous and who actually likes him. He'd follow this girl anywhere and not one of us could blame him for girls like this rarely come along in life.The plot is somewhat predictable but the movie has enough funny, quirky and memorable characters that you will enjoy it anyway. There is one very memorable kiss which takes place at a party, while David Gray's ""This Years Love"" plays in the background. This same song plays again at the end when they are in the limo, but interestingly enough the song is not included on the movie soundtrack CD??? For guys like myself who are a little older, the movie represents a time in life when anything is possible and within reach if you just have that unreachable,beautiful woman by your side. Thing is, most young guys never believe they could get a girl like Elisha. So the movie is about much more than a porno star moving next door. Its about taking risks, putting your heart out there, reaching for what you want even though it appears unreachable. And finally, God, is Elisha Cuthbert just unreal!!!",2005
7,"This is an enjoyable yet ultimately forgettable film. The ""boy rescues cute girl from terrible life"" plot has been done many times before, no doubt in many better ways. Emile Hirsch performs passably well with the material he is given, and the luscious Elisha Cuthbert provides plenty of eye candy that she could not show in 24. The rest of the characters are one-dimensional and barely worthy of mention. But the show belongs to Timothy Olyphant. Although he does not even appear until halfway through the film, his role makes the entire movie worth watching again. He screen presence is palpable as the ultra-cool bad boy that every man secretly wishes to be. Scruffy, chain-smoking, alternately funny, friendly then dangerous, he owns every scene in which he appears. Seeing this film makes one that much more anxious for the next season of JUSTIFIED to begin!",2010
10,"If this Isn't Your favorite movie you should re- evaluate your life. It is perfect. There are no flaws. This movie changed my life. I watch it every day. Over and over again. It makes me feel all tingly inside. If you do not get the same feeling, perhaps repeated viewing of this movie will cause you to feel the same sensations. In a manner of speaking, this movie is part of some greater force not of this earth. It is as if the angels in the sky above decided to craft an experience for earthlings to worship for all time and sent it down via this movie. For those of you who think I am joking, I assure you I am not. I do not care what you think of me. I may get beat up in school by the ""cool kids"" every day because I do not do anything with my life besides watch this movie. They may shove me into lockers and give me ""swirlies."" I may sing Dido naked when no one is home. None of this matters. As they say, not knowing where you're going is the best way to get someplace you've never been.",2006
7,"Initially, I was simply lost in the world of late night pay television, and stumbled across this just as it started. After reading the description; (plot summary on the interactive program guide); I figured that this would be just the sleeping pill I needed to go to sleep with. Thankfully enough, I was wrong. As others have mentioned, this film pays homage to Risky Business, but in its own quirky way. Emile Hirsch simply comes across as a very likable high school kid who's never taken any kind of risk, has always had his life planned out, has his future all lined up... Until SHE moves in next door. Elisha Cuthberts' character starts out promising, but falls flat. There isn't enough development into her back-story, (aside from one quick reference to her high school days), no real telling of her story overall. Which isn't to say her performance was flat, it was well above par, and a whole different direction from the character she played on ""24"". Timothy Olyphant is perfect. He has enough depth in his character to make up for any other shortcomings this film suffers from. Overall, this is a mostly harmless film, that will leave the viewer with a smile, and maybe a chuckle or two. If you find yourself with a case of the late-night-can't-sleep-blues, go ahead, watch this. You won't be sorry.",2006
9,I don't like the way this movie was marketed as if it is a teen comedy. YES it has the jocks and the losers but I wouldn't class this as a teen comedy at all. It's so much deeper and really much more of a love story / adventure because that's what happens.,2006
10,"If you liked Risky Business and you have a love of teen comedy, then this is the perfect movie for you. Well written and almost perfectly acted. The plot is cute and entertaining and all the set ups pay off very well, not to mention that Elisha Cuthbert has never been hotter (and probably never will be again). This movie puts a new spin on romantic comedy while keeping the audience's attention through many suspenseful subplots. If you don't expect much, this film will blow you away. If you go in thinking it's one of the best teen romantic comedies out there, you'll still end up happy. Rent it, buy it, worship it....at least buy it.",2005
8,"Billed on the cover as ""American Pie meets Risky Business"" you'd expect The Girl Next Door to be one of the mindless teen comedies so ubiquitous in today's market. Typically I wouldn't have given this DVD a second look, but I like Elisha Cuthbert so I picked it up.",2006
8,"The Girl Next Door is a great movie. I saw the movie a year or so ago and since then i have bought the DVD. The first thing about this movie that i like is yes, it is a teen movie, but it does not rely on dirty jokes and down right stupidity to be funny. eg (american pie) Timothy Olyphant is great as Kelly and Emile Hirsch plays the role well of the teenage kid who is blown away when he see the beautiful Elisha Cuthbert (who also shines in this being her first feature film) has moved in next door.",2006
9,"This movie was absolutely awesome! Considering the topics discussed in this movie are the basis of teenage minds these days, almost every other student at my school and other schools love this movie! It is hot, sexy, and yet is a wake up call that you don't have to be like everyone else. This is not a porn oriented movie. Sure it uses the subject of porn throughout the movie but to really make a point which is well received. Parents wouldn't understand this movie and little kids sure would not. But in today's twisted day and age for the youth, this is really a good comedy. Great movie with hilarious, sweet moments!",2006
8,"I really expected this to be awful, clichéd and embarrassing....BUT, this turned out to be a pleasant surprise.",2006
8,really funny movie. We really enjoyed watching it; and even the extra scenes and material were worth the money...,2005
8,Matthew Kidman (Emile Hirsch) is a high school student and he is also a straight laced overachiever. Matthew never really lived life until he falls for his hot new neighbor (Elisha Cuthbert). But Matthew and his new neighbor have a nice relationship going until Matthew's close friend (Chris Marquette) discover that Matthew's girlfriend is a former porn star. Matthew's sheltered existence spins out of control.,2005
8,"Wicked Sexy Comedy, thats just what may sum this movie up... Its not quite just another punk movie from Hollywood, but this one's different... It's about devotion and love...",2005
9,"The Girl Next Door was one of the most surprising films of 2004. I thought this movie was just going to be another dumb and pointless teen flick when I saw the trailer for it last year and I didn't want to waste my time on it. But my viewing was wrong and when it was aired on HBO for the first time, I watched it and liked it a lot. The movie was great with an amazing soundtrack with such wonderful songs. Elisha Cuthbert is a good actress and looked beautiful in the movie. She was hard to resist watching. Emile Hirsch and Timothy Olyphant also had good performances in the movie. Overall, The Girl Next Door was a very surprising and funny teen film. I highly recommend it.",2005
10,"So this was yet another teen movie, but based on an adult theme,  I for one laughed out loud the whole time, I may have a mind of a 15 year old (I'm 35) so it was a very enjoyable experience.",2004
10,"BSG is a wonderful sci-fi series! In the midst of the battles between the human kind and the robots, the dark sides of the people are exposed whereas the robots display in themselves what humanity should be. The desire to survive, the yearning for the Earth, and the hope for the future drive both the humans and the robots as the distinctions between them gradually disappear.",2010
10,"When George Lucas announced that he was to make the Star Wars prequels I had this preconception of a darker, better acted, and more more grown up version of the movies that were made in the late seventies - early eighties. Instead we got a bunch of kids movies, littered with some of the most terrible cinematic decisions ever put on celluloid.",2009
10,"1. If you want mindless techno-babble, then this show isn't for you. 2. If you don't manage to appreciate what good... no, let me rephrase that for you: exquisite acting is, then you definitely shouldn't watch it. 3. If you expect to have a crew of four, including a science doctor, an alien, a military and some random Indiana Jones guy, all of them solving new let's-save-the-Earth-before-lunch problems, then skip BSG, is not for you. 4. If you're afraid of seeing real human stories put into a SF shell, perhaps you should go back to Star Trek (and I'm a trekkie too, but...) 5. If you crave to hear 'shields up' or 'engage' or other classic one- liners, then you should rather settle for ""frak"". Or is it ""frakk""? 6. If you're unable to follow a 4 season-long story arc with every episode adding something precious to it without having withdrawal symptoms, then you should really don't give it a try. 7. If all that you want is see people in tight suits flashing laser pistols and teleporting from harms' way, then change the channel. 8. If your interest for spiritual quests, tough sexy girls and people really dying and not returning is something like zero. Oh well, you might skip that 'dying and not returning part' :P 9. If you don't like space battles rendered so real (and with as most care for real physics as a TV SF show can take) that you feel you ARE there. 10. Finally, if you have a mind so closed that you cannot appreciate what the best SF show ever made is all about. ",2010
10,"As a child of the 70's I can say that I loved the original BSG and always wanted a proper return to the story, not that lame attempt called ""Gallactica"" with the guy from ""Adam 12"". However, I was skeptical about this new show because of the core changes, like making Starbuck and Boomer female, for example. It didn't matter. This is one of the best TV shows ever made. It's dramatic, funny, sad, extremely dark and immensely engrossing. By changing the character of Baltar from a ruthless power hungry madman in the original to the witless and sympathetic patsy that he is at the beginning of this show creates a whole new dynamic to this character and his development. Adding the president to be a counter balance to Adama instead of the commander automatically ruling over everyone was far more believable than the council full of wusses that were supposed to be in charge in the '78 version. ",2006
10,"When I heard that the Science Fiction Channel (I refuse to acknowledge their new name), I was less than thrilled. The original series was, to put it bluntly, crap. They took a great idea, the near genocide of a species and let it rot. Rather than keeping it within the boundaries they set, Glen Larson and company made it basically, the fugitive in space. I won't go into how there was no science in this at all, no jump engines, no warp, no FTL of any kind. Of how they knew nothing about any astronomy, or the stupid measurements that meant nothing. The writing was horrible, many episodes were just rip offs of movies, the acting barely tolerable. So I was less than thrilled. However, when I heard that Ron Moore, one of the geniuses behind Deep Space Nine, the best of all the Star Trek spin-offs, was doing it. I was interested. Then, when I saw the miniseries, I was hooked. Galactica is a brilliant show that brought humanity back to Science Fiction. As the show went on and more and more plot threads were revealed, the show was shown to be complex, the kind of TV that's been lacking and can only be held up with excellent shows like Dexter and Breaking Bad. Brilliant in every aspect, Galactica is the kind of show that cannot be understood in one viewing, it has to be watched again and again. Galactica led the way for a resurgence of intelligent Science Fiction, with shows like Fringe and Flash Forward following it's example. Four seasons was for some, too short, but for me a perfect length. I eagerly await THE PLAN.",2009
10,"I am a die hard devoted Trekker. No other show can come close to the series I hold so dear to my heart.... or can it? I watched the mini series on sci-fi expecting to be disappointed. What happened in reality was a show I will honestly say is second to none, the best science fiction out there. The story lines are top notch, the struggles make you feel for the characters, you really get into this show. (that and I have never found a robot so hot before. Did I just say that out loud?) The way the camera moves makes you feel like you are looking out a port hole at the action outside. Its not like other shows, this is hard hitting, nitty-gritty sci-fi. Unlike what we have been led to think the future is not all bright and promising , the future is bleak, hard and depressing. The technology we thought would make our lives easier will in fact be the end of our lives (FEAR THE MACHINE!!) Bad toaster. It is 4 seasons (and final sadly) in and still as entertaining as ever. It will be a sad day for geeks everywhere when the series finale airs. But at least we can live in the knowledge that we were here to see the series to end all series. So Say We All.",2008
10,"Battlestar Galactica is more a war/survival series set in a futuresque environment, rather than hardcore science-fiction in a war environment - the latter being what we tend to find in star trek and the likes.",2013
10,"I was a fan of the original and a fan of science fiction, but more so I am a fan of great cinematic television. This show went beyond my wildest dreams. Some people have a hard time with certain dramatic and artistic choices made by the producers, but to me those choices only make the show stronger and gutsier. The new Battlestar Galactica concentrates on characters, drama, and the human condition and shies away from the fantasy, serial elements of the original and others of the genre. A first rate cast with real acting chops help ground the story and characters in a universe where the audience cares what happens to them. This is the antithesis of the original that relied on caricature villains and cartoon story lines. The new show tackles real life issues about human rights, religion, and the moral ambiguity of war. It's no wonder Battlestar Galactica has garnered glowing reviews from Time Magazine, Rolling Stone, TV Guide, and the American Film Institute.",2006
6,"This show is so messed up that the writers had to pull a ""Deus ex machina"" to tie up loose ends in the finale!!!",2009
1,"After watching the whole series, I must say this was a total disappointment, and the ultimate proof about how things are done in Hollywood: good contacts, speaking loud, and making the audience believe they are smarter than they really are because the series it's ""intelligent"".",2009
2,"The show started out as one of the greatest, best written shows I have seen. Some where along the way they either ran out of ideas or had a fear of success or something. The original concept, that the Cylons were fighting a genocidal war against humans was thrown out when it was revealed that several key humans were actually cylon sleeper agents. If they had been activated the war would have been over the first week. It was one of the changes that completely negated the earlier, excellent episodes. It was similar to when the movie Aliens 3 starts starts off with meaningless deaths of key characters from Aliens2 or when Brad Ratner had Xmen start killing each other off in Xmen3. These things are bad by themselves but also taint all the earlier episodes. How can you go back and enjoy the first seasons of the show knowing that most of the actions by key characters are lies and completely illogical since you now know they are cylons. A bitter, bitter, disappointment.",2008
2,"When they aren't fighting killer robots they fight themselves, but at least the writers showed nicely how people crack in a confined space after a disaster. As long as you try to not yell at the shaky camera you can still watch this.",2009
1,"From the channel that brought you MEGALADON 3, BOAS, PYTHONS and LARVA, comes another all-too-successful attempt at wringing the intellect out of Science Fiction. BSG: The New Series.",2005
1,"The fans of this show, like to use the excuse that the negative reviews are only from un-reasoning fans of the original, who don't like the new version. So let's look at it objectively, regardless of the original.",2006
5,"Alas, after reading the comments, most users believe the new Battlestar Galactica (BSG) is fantastic and riveting, I must have missed something. Having seen almost every episodes of the new BSG series, I have come to the following conclusion. The new BSG has been re-imaged and reinterpreted so radically from the old BSG that it is mostly futile to debate which series is better or worse. The new BSG will stand on its own merits and we should totally ignore the old BSG. That being said, what do I think about the new BSG? It is a nice scifi show. It's not great, it's not bad, it's just . . . nice. There are some nice computer FX of battles, Space ships, robots, and scenes. There is just enough action, angst, ""love"", humor, death, and misery in each episode. The actors are doing a nice job with the materials given. The story plots are nice scifi formulas with scifi type words added to the nice dialog. The humans are nice and the Cylons are nice. Oh, how nice. Another hour of my life, gone.",2005
2,"I am the Sci-Fi channel's dream viewer in that I will watch pretty much anything that they can chum the waters with - and we ARE talking about some programming with more in common with fermented fish guts than with anything that could reasonably be called drama. But I still watch. During the week, throughout the day, it's the same 10-11 episodes of the same 5-8 canceled TV series, over and over again - FOR YEARS! (I believe that I have seen enough ""Tru Calling"" to recite the dialog along with the actors, the same way we used to at midnight showings of ""Rocky Horror.) During the week, prime time, we get maybe one new episode of a current show, ramped up to by old episodes of the same show. Then comes the weekend. Cobras, boas, anacondas, copperheads, (Apparently snakes are easy to do CGI.) giant rapacious sharks, carnivorous locusts, dragons, cursed angels...all paraded past us in indifferently written, cheaply produced fashion. But I still watch, and for the most part, enjoy. I enjoy because I think that most of us who started watching televised science fiction (When there were really only three channels, when the creatures were usually enlarged garden denizens, large bug-like sculptures, or just some guy wearing something that looked like one of your auntie's failed quilting projects, and when any sci-fi tended to be broadcast long after our parents had been safely tucked into bed and Johnny Carson had signed off.) learned early on that a little artistic honesty and a sense of humor are far more important than overly dramatic posturing to any show's success as entertainment. Most of Skiffy's creature-feature programs are undeniably bad science fiction, and not worth a second look or thought, but succeed nonetheless as entertainment, which is something that they share with undeniably good science fiction like ""Babylon 5"". What they also share with ""Babylon 5"" is that they are all better than ""Battlestar Galactica"".",2008
2,What were they thinking?! The mini-series looked terrible and I was expecting at least some semblance of effort to make the series at least look acceptable. But of course not! Why spoil the SciFi Channel reputation for cheap and cheesy entertainment.,2005
1,"I may be looked as harsh, but other than idea of invading alien race and similar named characters, Battle Star is terrible to watch.",2006
1,"This new Galactica is a huge disappointment. The old one (1978) is a masterpiece in a comparison to this. They managed to ruin the complete concept. Everything is not how it should be. The director does a bad job. The fighting scenes are comical. Special effects were better in the old series. The characters are poorly written. Also, they managed to transform Sturbuck, the hero of my childhood, into a female character, although there were some interesting female pilot characters in the old series. If you want to waste your time, then watch this one. I am the great fan of the old Galactica so maybe this makes me too critical, but still I think that the new one deserves only 1 star ( I would give it 0 if I could).",2007
10,"This show has the potential to be wonderful. Hugh Laurie does an excellent job (and American accent I might add - he's British) as a sarcastic, yet super intelligent doctor. The show has a wonderful cast and the illnesses these patients come in with are very interesting. The acting is brilliant. It hasn't really been about the doctors yet, but it's starting to get a bit more personal. Up until now (the 3rd episode), it's been mostly about the patients, which is what you want in the beginning of a show. The comic relief is that Dr. House has to do work in the walk-in clinic where every hypochondriac in New Jersey comes walking in... his dealing with them is hilarious. And just as additional enjoyment, Jesse Spencer is very pleasing to the eyes. :)",2004
10,"This is one of the best, most lifelike medical dramas I have ever seen.",2006
10,"""House M.D."" hit our screens two years ago and could have be lost in the myriad of other medico shows on TV currently. However, the ingenuity of wit seen in the script and the complexity of Laurie's performance has caused this show to rise above the pack! The range of talent demonstrated by the actors makes the show both compelling and simultaneously medically credible. Highly recommended to all who are fascinated by the quirky!",2006
10,"Normally when I watch a series, I mildly enjoy it and wander through the series mindlessly, particularly with sitcoms. On very rare occasions, a show will pop up that I enjoy the main actor so much I follow him around for a couple years. This happened with House. ",2015
10,"Okay.. so i am kind of a late bloomer and i am man enough to admit that i should have watched this show eons ago. This show is absurdly good but not the eighth season-will come to that part. Gregory house M.D. is a super genius diagnostician and not a people person. He is self-centred jack-ass who doesn't care about the patients or any other people around making him my kind of doctor. The house character is played by Hugh laurie with utmost brilliance. All the other characters including wislon, cameron, lisa, foreman chase etc brought there A game to the table. ",2013
10,"I never paid much attention to ""House MD"" when it first premiered. I heard from a couple of people that it was basically the same thing every episode: Impossible disease to diagnose, House messes with his team, House suddenly solves the case.",2012
10,"They say that if you combine a great character with a great actor, you're halfway to a great show. ""House M.D."" seems to do that with most of its cast, but especially Gregory House and Hugh Laurie. House is a snarky, sarcastic, occasionally callous but adorable jerk. He is also the most brilliant yet least well-adjusted doctor at Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital. Around him are three junior doctors, all three of whom have varied but interesting personalities. There is also his only friend, James Wilson, an oncologist and his superior with whom he has a rather antagonistic relationship. House involves strange, rare and complicated cases with no easy diagnosis, resulting in the spouting of some mind-numbing medical terminology(which I thought was a brave and successful attempt at retaining some reality)and often character-driven story lines. ""House"" has the best writing for any show in America, if you don't believe me just check the ""quotes"" section for samples of dialogue. House had an infarction in his leg, resulting in it becoming painful and near-impossible to move, which made him addicted to a painkilling drug known as Vicodin., which proves to be the source of many problems. House is, for all his imperfectness, a genius, a master of observation which is depicted in his clinic cases as he can instantly detect either and environmental cause for the disease/problem or find some the patient themselves do not know about. He is a deep character, though, and flawed, but likable, making him a cornerstone for this shows incredible success with the critics, though mainstream audiences prove less receptive and prefer to tune into pseudo-romantic, unintelligent trash like ""Grey's Anatomy"", a classic example of catering to the mainstream resulting in distaste from most critics. Why have not even FIVE ratings come for this show? Please rate it, even if your opinion differs to mine, rate it!!!!",2007
7,"I've watched House from the first episode and really like the show, but one thing it is NOT is a MEDICAL drama, as so many previous posters have said. What it is is a very well-written program that delves into people's personalities and motivations set in a hospital backdrop with the diagnostic dilemma of the week to add interest.",2006
10,About ten or twelve episodes into the first season i switched on two a random show called 'House'. I only got to watch the last ten minutes of the episode but from the moment I saw it I was HOOKED! Now I've got the DVD set and follow the new series religiously!!,2006
